00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,909
CHAPTER ONE
Beware of the Dog

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:08,330
Down below there was only a vast white sea
of clouds.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,769
Above there was the sun, and the sun was white
like the clouds, because it is never yellow

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,430
when one looks at it from high in the air.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,810
He was still flying the Spitfire.

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,130
His right hand was on the controls.

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,670
It was quite easy.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,790
The machine was flying well.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,750
He knew what he was doing.

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,710
Everything is fine, he thought.

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,529
I know my way home.

12
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:35,250
I'll be there in half an hour.

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,780
When I land I shall switch off my engine and
say, 'Help me to get out, will you?'

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,940
I shall make my voice sound ordinary and natural
and none of them will take any notice.

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,780
Then I shall say, 'Someone help me to get
out.

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,700
I can't do it alone because I've lost one
of my legs.'

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:02,829
They'll all laugh and think I'm joking and
I shall say, 'All right, come and have a look.'

18
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,920
Then Yorky will climb up on to the wing and
look inside.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,720
He'll probably be sick because of all the
blood and the mess.

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,640
I shall laugh and say, 'For God's sake, help
me get out.'

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,270
He glanced down again at his right leg.

22
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,600
There was not much of it left.

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,440
The bullets had hit him, just above the knee,
and now there was nothing but a great mess

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,060
and a lot of blood.

25
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,619
But there was no pain.

26
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:38,229
When he looked down, he felt as if he were
seeing something that did not belong to him.

27
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:44,900
It was just a mess which was there; something
strange and unusual and rather interesting.

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,729
It was like finding a dead cat on the sofa.

29
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:57,060
He still felt fine, and because he still felt
fine, he felt excited and unafraid.

30
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,619
I won't even bother to radio for the ambulance,
he thought.

31
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:02,550
It isn't necessary.

32
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,869
And when I land I'll sit there quite normally
and say, 'Some of you fellows come and help

33
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:11,890
me out, will you, because I've lost one of
my legs.'

34
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,250
I'll laugh a little while I'm saying it; I'll
say it calmly and slowly, and they'll think

35
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,260
I'm joking.

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,310
Then when I get out I'll make my report.

37
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,530
Later I'll go up to London.

38
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,970
I'll take that bottle of whisky with me and
I'll give it to Bluey.

39
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,090
We'll sit in her room and drink it.

40
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,940
When it's time to go to bed, I'll say, 'Bluey,
I've got a surprise for you.

41
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,770
I lost a leg today.

42
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,540
But I don't mind if you don't.

43
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,300
It doesn't even hurt...'

44
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,520
We'll go everywhere in cars.

45
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,300
I always hated walking.

46
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,849
Then he saw the sun shining on the engine
cover of his plane.

47
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,569
He saw the sun shining on the metal, and he
remembered the aeroplane and remembered where

48
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,220
he was.

49
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,840
He realized that he was no longer feeling
good; that he was sick and his head was spinning.

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,290
His head kept falling forward on to his chest
because his neck no longer seemed to have

51
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,220
any strength.

52
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,650
But he knew that he was flying the Spitfire.

53
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,730
Between the fingers of his right hand he could
feel the handle of the stick which guided

54
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,709
it.

55
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,500
I'm going to faint, he thought.

56
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,170
He looked at the controls.

57
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,459
Seven thousand meters.

58
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:39,010
To test himself he tried to read the hundreds
as well as the thousands.

59
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,460
Seven thousand and what?

60
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,730
As he looked, he had difficulty reading the
dial and he could not even see the needle.

61
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,930
He knew then that he must get out; that there
was not a second to lose, otherwise he would

62
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,980
become unconscious.

63
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,470
Quickly he tried to slide back the top, but
he didn't have the strength.

64
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,970
For a second he took his right hand off the
stick and with both hands managed to push

65
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,459
the top back.

66
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,280
The cold air on his face seemed to help.

67
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,300
He had a moment of great clearness.

68
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,959
His actions became automatic.

69
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,979
That is what happens with a good pilot.

70
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:24,520
He took some deep breaths from his oxygen
mask, and as he did so, he looked out over

71
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,580
the side.

72
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,979
Down below there was only a vast white sea
of cloud and he realized that he did not know

73
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,150
where he was.

74
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,639
It'll be the English Channel, he thought.

75
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,879
I'm sure to fall in the water.

76
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,900
He slowed down, pulled off his mask, undid
his safety equipment and pushed the stick

77
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,999
hard over to the left.

78
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:55,240
The plane turned smoothly over on to its back
and the pilot fell out.

79
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,569
As he fell, he opened his eyes, because he
knew that he must not become unconscious before

80
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:03,259
he had opened his parachute.

81
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:09,159
On one side he saw the sun; on the other he
saw the whiteness of the clouds, and as he

82
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:17,629
fell, as he turned in the air, the white clouds
chased the sun and the sun chased the clouds.

83
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:23,259
Suddenly there was no longer any sun but only
a great whiteness.

84
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:30,490
It was so white that sometimes it looked black,
and after a while it was either white or black,

85
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,180
but mostly it was white.

86
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,680
He watched it as it turned from white to black,
and then back to white again, and the white

87
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,189
stayed for a long time but the black lasted
only a few seconds.

88
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:48,840
He seemed to go to sleep during the white
periods and to wake up just in time to see

89
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,780
the world when it was black.

90
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,660
It was white when he put out a hand and touched
something.

91
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,960
He took it between his fingers and felt it.

92
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,870
For a time he lay there, letting the tips
of his fingers play with the thing which they

93
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,080
had touched.

94
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,210
Then slowly he opened his eyes, looked down
at his hand and saw that he was holding something

95
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,509
which was white.

96
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,219
It was the edge of a sheet.

97
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:21,119
He closed his eyes and opened them again quickly.

98
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,219
This time he saw the room.

99
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:28,749
He saw the bed in which he was lying: he saw
the grey walls and the door and the green

100
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:31,490
curtains over the window.

101
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,740
There were some roses on the table by his
bed and beside the roses was a small medicine

102
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,380
glass.

103
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,940
This is a hospital, he thought.

104
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,289
I am in a hospital.

105
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:47,219
But he could remember nothing.

106
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:52,449
He lay back on his pillow, looking at the
ceiling and wondering what had happened.

107
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:57,809
He was staring at the smooth greyness of the
ceiling which was so clean and grey, and then

108
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:01,139
suddenly he saw a fly walking upon it.

109
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,839
The sight of this fly touched the surface
of his brain, and quickly, in that second,

110
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:09,369
he remembered everything.

111
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:14,199
He remembered the plane and he remembered
the dial showing seven thousand meters.

112
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,629
He remembered jumping out.

113
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:19,419
He remembered his leg.

114
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,550
It seemed all right now.

115
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,960
He looked down at the end of the bed, but
he could not tell.

116
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,349
He put one hand underneath the bedclothes
and felt for his knees.

117
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,650
He found one of them, but when he felt for
the other his hand touched something which

118
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,580
was soft and covered in bandages.

119
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,939
Just then the door opened and a nurse came
in.

120
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:44,680
'Hello,' she said.

121
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,279
'So you've woken up at last.'

122
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,439
She was not good-looking, but she was large
and clean.

123
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,360
She was between thirty and forty and she had
fair hair.

124
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,239
He did not notice more than that.

125
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:59,399
'Where am I?'

126
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,020
'You're a lucky fellow.

127
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,210
You landed in a wood near the beach.

128
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,169
You're in Brighton.

129
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,999
They brought you in two days ago, and now
you're better.

130
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:11,580
You look fine.'

131
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,169
'I've lost a leg,' he said.

132
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:15,399
'That's nothing.

133
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,080
We'll get you another one.

134
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,849
Now you must go to sleep.

135
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:23,669
The doctor will be coming to see you in about
an hour.'

136
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,569
She picked up the medicine glass and went
out.

137
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:29,909
But he did not sleep.

138
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:34,019
He wanted to keep his eyes open because he
was frightened that if he shut them again

139
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:36,669
everything would go away.

140
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,990
He lay looking at the ceiling.

141
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,889
The fly was still there.

142
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:46,089
He was still watching it when the nurse opened
the door and stood to one side while the doctor

143
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:47,589
came in.

144
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:52,720
He was an Army doctor with some military ribbons
from the last war on his chest.

145
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,720
He had a cheerful face and kind eyes.

146
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,740
'Well, well,' he said.

147
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,870
'So you've decided to wake up at last.

148
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,120
How are you feeling?'

149
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,190
'I feel all right.'

150
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,730
'You'll soon be walking again.'

151
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,960
The doctor took his wrist to check his blood
pressure.

152
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,529
He said, 'Some of the lads from your base
were ringing up and asking about you.

153
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,300
They wanted to come and see you but I said
they'd better wait a day or two.

154
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,580
Just lie quiet and rest for a bit.

155
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,480
Got something to read?'

156
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,639
He glanced at the table with the roses.

157
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,639
'No.

158
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,310
Well, the nurse will look after you.

159
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,880
She'll get you anything you want.'

160
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,149
Then he went out, followed by the nurse.

161
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,990
When they had gone, he lay back and looked
at the ceiling again.

162
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:49,459
The fly was still there and as he lay watching
it he heard the noise of an aeroplane in the

163
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,769
distance.

164
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:53,949
He lay listening to the sound of its engines.

165
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:56,100
It was a long way away.

166
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,820
I wonder what it is, he thought.

167
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,140
Let me see if I can recognize it.

168
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,889
Suddenly he moved his head to one side.

169
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:10,630
Anyone who has been bombed can tell the noise
of a German Junkers 88.

170
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,370
It is a noise one cannot mistake.

171
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,430
He lay listening to the noise and felt quite
certain about what it was.

172
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,600
But why was there no alarm and no guns?

173
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,649
That German pilot was certainly taking a risk
coming near Brighton alone in daylight.

174
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:35,380
The aeroplane was always far away and soon
the noise faded into the distance.

175
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,380
Later there was another.

176
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,720
This one, too, was far away, but he was sure
he recognized the sound.

177
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,360
He remembered the noise clearly from air battles
he had fought.

178
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,740
He was puzzled.

179
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,430
There was a bell on the table by the bed.

180
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,000
He reached out his hand and rang it.

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,079
He heard the noise of footsteps down the corridor.

182
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,079
The nurse came in.

183
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:03,220
'Nurse, what were those aeroplanes?'

184
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,110
'I don't know.

185
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,450
I didn't hear them.

186
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,509
Probably fighters or bombers.

187
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,830
I expect they were returning from France.

188
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,149
Why, what's the matter?'

189
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,899
'They were German.

190
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,149
I know the sound of the engines.

191
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:20,250
There were two of them.

192
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,000
What were they doing over here?'

193
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,980
The nurse came to the side of his bed and
began to straighten the sheets.

194
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,089
'You're imagining things.

195
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,850
You mustn't worry.

196
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,190
Would you like me to get you something to
read?'

197
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,670
'No, thank you.'

198
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,740
She brushed back the hair from his forehead
with her hand.

199
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,709
'They never come over in daylight any longer.

200
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:43,580
You know that,' she said.

201
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,269
'They were probably British.'

202
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:47,589
'Nurse.'

203
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:48,910
'Yes?'

204
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,009
'Could I have a cigarette?'

205
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,970
'Of course you can.'

206
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,410
She went out and came back almost immediately
with a packet of cigarettes and some matches.

207
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:03,480
She gave him one, and when he had put it in
his mouth she struck a match and lit it.

208
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,000
'If you want me again just ring the bell.'

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,620
She went out.

210
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,329
Later, he heard the noise of another aircraft.

211
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:17,860
It was far away, but nevertheless he knew
that it was a single-engine machine.

212
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,970
It was going fast; he could tell that.

213
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,709
It wasn't a British aircraft.

214
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,180
It didn't sound like an American engine either.

215
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,550
They make more noise.

216
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:34,709
He did not know what it was and this worried
him greatly.

217
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,829
Perhaps I am very ill, he thought.

218
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:40,870
Perhaps I am imagining things.

219
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:47,680
I simply do not know what to think.

220
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,689
That evening the nurse came in with a basin
of hot water and began to wash him.

221
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:57,819
'Well,' she said, 'I hope you don't think
that we're being bombed.'

222
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,630
He did not answer.

223
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,070
She rubbed some more soap on him and began
to wash his chest.

224
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,889
'You're looking fine this evening,' she said.

225
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:10,230
'They operated on you as soon as you came
in.

226
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,160
They did a marvelous job.

227
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,860
You'll be all right.

228
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,769
I've got a brother in the RAF,' she added.

229
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:19,550
'Flying bombers.'

230
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,459
He said, 'I went to school in Brighton.'

231
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:24,970
She looked up quickly.

232
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,880
'Well, that's fine,' she said.

233
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,990
'I expect you'll know some people in the town.'

234
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,959
'Yes,' he said, 'I know quite a few.'

235
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:38,660
She had finished washing his chest and arms.

236
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,449
Now she turned back the bedclothes so that
his left leg was uncovered.

237
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:46,840
She did it in such a way that the rest of
his injured leg remained under the sheets.

238
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:55,189
She took his pyjama trousers off and now began
to wash his left leg and the rest of his body.

239
00:13:55,189 --> 00:14:00,320
This was the first time that he had had a
bed-bath and he was embarrassed.

240
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,610
She laid a towel under his leg and began washing
his foot.

241
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,800
She said, 'This soap is awful to use.

242
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,319
It's the water.

243
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:10,760
It's so hard.'

244
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:19,449
He said, 'None of the soap is very good now
and, of course, with hard water it's hopeless.'

245
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:22,779
As he said it he remembered something.

246
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,809
He remembered the baths which he used to take
at school in Brighton.

247
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:31,269
He remembered how the water was so soft that
you had to take a shower afterwards to get

248
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:34,160
all the soap off your body.

249
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,680
He remembered that sometimes the school doctor
used to say that soft water was bad for your

250
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
teeth.

251
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,399
'In Brighton,' he said, 'the water isn't...'

252
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,980
He did not finish the sentence.

253
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,949
He had thought of something; something so
unbelievable that for a moment he felt like

254
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:56,730
telling the nurse about it and having a good
laugh.

255
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,730
She looked up.

256
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,769
'The water isn't what?'

257
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:01,000
she said.

258
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,879
'Nothing,' he answered.

259
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,269
'I was dreaming.'

260
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:10,500
She wiped the soap off his leg and dried him
with a towel.

261
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,170
'It's nice to be washed,' he said.

262
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,000
'I feel better.'

263
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,300
That night he could not sleep.

264
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,879
He lay awake thinking of the German aircraft
and of the hardness of the water.

265
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,839
He could think of nothing else.

266
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,420
They were German, he said to himself.

267
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,990
I know they were.

268
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:37,009
But it is not possible, because they would
not be flying around so low over here in daylight.

269
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:43,079
I know that it is true, and at the same time
I know that it is impossible.

270
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,450
Perhaps I am ill.

271
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,639
Perhaps I am imagining all this.

272
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:54,499
For a long time he lay awake thinking these
things, and once he sat up in bed and said

273
00:15:54,499 --> 00:16:02,589
aloud, 'I will prove that I am not crazy,'
but before he had time to think any more,

274
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:07,269
he was asleep.

275
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:11,199
He woke just as the first light of day was
showing through the gap in the curtains at

276
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,689
the window.

277
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:18,369
He remembered the Junkers 88 and the hardness
of the water; he remembered the large pleasant

278
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:24,839
nurse and the kind doctor, and now the doubt
in his mind began to grow.

279
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,809
He looked around the room.

280
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:30,199
The nurse had taken the roses out the night
before.

281
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:35,480
There was nothing except the table with a
packet of cigarettes and a box of matches.

282
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,649
The room was bare.

283
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:39,449
It was no longer warm or friendly.

284
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:41,360
It was not even comfortable.

285
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,790
It was cold and empty and very quiet.

286
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,519
His doubt and fear grew so that he became
restless and angry.

287
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,999
It was the kind of fear one gets not because
one is afraid but because one feels that there

288
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,600
is something wrong.

289
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,730
He knew that he must do something; that he
must find some way of proving to himself that

290
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,720
he was either right or wrong, and he looked
up and saw again the window and the green

291
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,750
curtains.

292
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:17,209
From where he lay, that window was right in
front of him, but it was ten meters away.

293
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,339
Somehow he must reach it and look out.

294
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:27,310
The idea took hold of him and soon he could
think of nothing except the window.

295
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,970
But what about his leg?

296
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,200
He put his hand underneath the bedclothes
and felt the bandages around what remained

297
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,770
of his right leg.

298
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,570
It seemed all right.

299
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,570
It didn't hurt.

300
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,490
But it would not be easy.

301
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,090
He sat up.

302
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,470
Then he pushed the bedclothes away and put
his left leg on the floor.

303
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:55,270
Slowly, carefully, he swung his body over
until he had both hands on the floor as well;

304
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,230
then he was out of bed, kneeling on the carpet.

305
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,730
He looked at what remained of his right leg,
wrapped in bandages.

306
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,870
It was beginning to hurt.

307
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:12,650
He wanted to lie down on the carpet and do
nothing, but he knew that he must go on.

308
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,280
With two arms and one leg, he crawled over
towards the window.

309
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,029
He would reach forward as far as he could
with his arms, then he would jump and slide

310
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:24,760
his left leg along after them.

311
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,190
It was painful but he continued to crawl across
the floor on two hands and one knee.

312
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,800
When he got to the window he reached up, and
one at a time he placed both hands on the

313
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,899
sill.

314
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:43,309
Slowly he raised himself up until he was standing
on his left leg.

315
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:48,130
Then quickly he opened the curtains and looked
out.

316
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:55,520
He saw a small house standing alone beside
a narrow lane, and behind it there was a field.

317
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,679
In front of the house there was an untidy
garden, and there was a green hedge separating

318
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,350
the garden from the lane.

319
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,490
He was looking at the hedge when he saw the
sign.

320
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:12,240
It was just a piece of board nailed to the
top of a short pole, and because the hedge

321
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,730
had not been cut for a long time the branches
had grown out around the sign so that it seemed

322
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,799
almost as if it had been placed in the middle
of the hedge.

323
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,250
There was something written on the board with
white paint.

324
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:30,500
He pressed his head against the glass of the
window, trying to read what it said.

325
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,100
The first letter was a G, he could see that.

326
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:41,770
The second was an A, and the third was an
R. One after another he managed to see what

327
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,580
the letters were.

328
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,980
There were three words, and slowly he spelled
the letters out aloud to himself as he managed

329
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,950
to read them.

330
00:19:51,950 --> 00:20:06,899
G-A-R-D-E A-U C-H-I-E-N, Garde au chien.

331
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:09,779
That is what it said.

332
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:14,390
He stood there balancing on one leg and holding
tightly to the edges of the window sill with

333
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:19,029
his hands, staring at the sign and the letters
of the words.

334
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:22,049
For a moment he could think of nothing at
all.

335
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:27,070
He stood there looking at the sign, repeating
the words to himself.

336
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,120
Slowly he began to realize the full meaning
of the thing.

337
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,440
He looked at the cottage and the field and
he looked at the green countryside beyond.

338
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,019
'So this is France,' he said.

339
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:43,820
'I am in France.'

340
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,750
Now the pain in his right side was very great.

341
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,000
It felt as if someone was hitting the end
of his missing leg with a hammer and suddenly

342
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,210
the pain became so bad that it affected his
head.

343
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,470
For a moment he thought he was going to fall.

344
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,480
Quickly he knelt down again, crawled back
to the bed and got in.

345
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,350
He pulled the bedclothes over himself and
lay back on the pillow, exhausted.

346
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,880
He could not forget the words on the sign.

347
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,500
It was some time before the nurse came in,
with a basin of hot water.

348
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,750
She said, 'Good morning, how are you today?'

349
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,149
He said, 'Good morning, nurse.'

350
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:30,450
The pain was still great under the bandages,
but he did not wish to tell this woman anything.

351
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,260
He looked at her more carefully now.

352
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,880
Her hair was very fair.

353
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,320
She was tall and big-boned and her face seemed
pleasant.

354
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,070
But there was something a little nervous about
her eyes.

355
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,820
They were never still.

356
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,020
There was something about her movements also.

357
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:53,450
They were too sharp to go well with the relaxed
manner in which she spoke.

358
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,800
She put down the basin, took off his pyjama
top and began to wash him.

359
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,179
'Did you sleep well?'

360
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,179
'Yes.'

361
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:04,019
'Good,' she said.

362
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:05,860
She was washing his chest.

363
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,760
'Someone's coming to see you from the Air
Ministry after breakfast,' she went on.

364
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,549
'They want a report.

365
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:15,110
How you got shot down and all that.

366
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,080
I won't let him stay long, so don't worry.'

367
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,270
Later she brought him his breakfast but he
did not want to eat.

368
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,649
He was still feeling weak and sick and he
wished only to lie still and think about what

369
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:28,830
had happened.

370
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,460
And there was a sentence running through his
head.

371
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,700
It was a sentence which Johnny, his commanding
officer, always repeated to the pilots every

372
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,000
day before they went out.

373
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,299
He could see Johnny now saying, 'And if they
get you, don't forget, only give your name

374
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,080
and number.

375
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,450
Nothing else.

376
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,750
For God's sake, say nothing else.'

377
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,710
'There you are,' she said.

378
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,539
'I've got you an egg.

379
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:58,549
Can you manage all right?'

380
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:59,750
'Yes.'

381
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,950
'Good.

382
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,409
If you want another egg, I might be able to
get you one.'

383
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:05,680
'This is all right.'

384
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,799
'Well, just ring the bell if you want any
more.'

385
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:12,180
And she went out.

386
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,960
He had just finished eating when the nurse
came in again.

387
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,510
She said, 'Wing Commander Roberts is here.

388
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,090
I've told him that he can only stay for a
few minutes.'

389
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:25,050
She signaled with her hand and the Wing Commander
came in.

390
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:30,220
'Sorry to bother you like this,' he said.

391
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,740
He was an ordinary RAF officer, dressed in
a rather badly fitting uniform.

392
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,800
As he spoke he took a printed form and a pencil
from his pocket and he pulled up a chair and

393
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
sat down.

394
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,580
'How are you feeling?'

395
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,710
There was no answer.

396
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,110
'Pity about your leg.

397
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,390
I know how you feel.

398
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,409
I hear you fought well before they got you.'

399
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:58,420
The man in the bed was lying quite still,
watching the man in the chair.

400
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,350
The man in the chair said, 'Well, let's finish
this quickly.

401
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:07,850
I'm afraid you'll have to answer a few questions
so that I can fill in my report.

402
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,799
Let me see now, first of all, where had you
flown from?'

403
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,029
The man in the bed did not move.

404
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:21,120
He looked straight at the Wing Commander and
he said, 'My name is Peter Williamson and

405
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,570
my number is nine seven two four five seven.'

406
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:25,749
- THE END -
