1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
ONE

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,640
The stranger

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:09,360
I don't usually pick up hitch-hikers, but this one was
different.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:20,360
He wasn't young, like the others, and he didn't have a bag, or a girlfriend, or a sign with "London" or "Lancaster" on
it.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:28,000
He just stood there, beside the road, with his hand out,
waiting.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,120
He was a man about forty years old, in a grey suit and red
tie.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,080
He was just watching the cars and waiting.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,720
He was watching me while I slowed down.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,600
I remember his eyes.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,960
Very pale blue eyes, staring at me through thin gold
glasses.

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,840
They looked surprised.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,600
Perhaps I was something strange, something not quite real to
him.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,080
Or perhaps he just had bad eyes.

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,720
Perhaps he couldn't see very well.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,800
I stopped the car and opened the window.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,320
"Where are you going?" I asked.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,080
"I'm going into town," he said.

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,600
"Into Lancaster. Could you give me a lift, please?"

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,400
"Yes, OK," I said.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,800
"I'm going that way. Jump in."

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,920
He got in and sat down beside me.

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,200
"Thank you very much," he said.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,120
"It's very kind of you."

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,640
"That's all right," I said.

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,360
"It's my pleasure."

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,681
I started the car and thought about the words he had used.

27
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,641
There was something strange about them.

28
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,561
Hitchhikers don't usually speak like that.

29
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:50,521
They usually say something like "Are you going to Lancaster?
Oh good, thanks a lot".

30
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:53,281
He spoke politely, like an older man.

31
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:55,801
But this man wasn't very old.

32
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:58,401
"Perhaps he's foreign," I thought.

33
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:02,161
I looked at him, and noticed something else.

34
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:06,801
"Could you put your seat-belt on, please?" I said.

35
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:07,761
He looked at me.

36
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,841
"I'm all right," he said.

37
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:17,881
"I don't like seat-belts very much. I feel like a prisoner
in the car."

38
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:26,081
"It's the law, you know. And I'm a police sergeant, so I
think you should wear one in my car."

39
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:38,561
"Oh, yes. I'm so sorry. The law. Yes... yes, I forgot." He looked around him, but for a moment he couldn't find the
seat-belt.

40
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:43,361
"It's there, behind you," I said.

41
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:48,401
"You do it like this." I helped him to put on the seat-belt.

42
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,961
"Yes, thank you," he said.

43
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:55,881
"I'm terribly sorry. I never remember these things."

44
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:57,721
"Oh, really," I said.

45
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:00,041
"Why? Don't you have a car?"

46
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:16,041
"No. Not now. I don't like them. I did have one once, but that was a long time ago..." For a moment I thought he would
continue, but then he stopped talking and stared quietly out of the window.

47
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,281
I looked at him again.

48
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:24,441
I'm a police officer, so it's my job to look at people and
to think carefully about them.

49
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:28,561
I was sure there was something strange about this man.

50
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:34,601
His hair – nobody has their hair cut quite like that now.

51
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:43,561
And that suit – it was quite clean, quite new, but the
trousers and lapels were wider than they usually are...

52
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:46,881
Where had I seen a suit like that before?

53
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:49,401
"Do you live near here?" I asked.

54
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:52,561
I was still wondering about him.

55
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:54,241
Was he a foreigner?

56
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:56,241
He smiled at me.

57
00:03:56,241 --> 00:04:02,681
"I live in Lancaster. In the centre of the town, in fact."

58
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:05,081
I was listening carefully.

59
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,561
"He speaks very good English," I thought.

60
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:22,201
"He speaks in the local way. I don't think he is a foreigner. But that face! It's the middle of summer now, and
we've had a lot of sun this year. Why is he so pale?"

61
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:26,361
"What sort of job do you do?" I asked.

62
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:28,481
He smiled at me again.

63
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:33,121
"Oh, I don't have a job at the moment," he said.

64
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:38,121
"That's why I don't have a car now, you see."

65
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:43,882
"You haven't driven for a long time, then?" I said.

66
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:45,202
He looked at me again.

67
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,722
That same quiet, surprised look.

68
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,962
"No, I haven't," he said.

69
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:55,162
"Not for a long time."

70
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,482
I smiled at him.

71
00:04:57,482 --> 00:05:01,002
"I thought you hadn't," I said.

72
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:08,802
"You've had to wear seat-belts in a car for many years.
Sorry," I continued.

73
00:05:08,802 --> 00:05:14,282
"It's my job. Police officers always play at detectives!"

74
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:17,242
"Yes, I see," he said.

75
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:18,922
He smiled.

76
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:27,442
A quiet, polite smile was on his mouth, but those pale eyes
were still and empty.

77
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:33,322
Then for a moment I stopped thinking about him because there
was a lot of traffic on the road.

78
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:42,202
Cars were moving very slowly, and I saw a policeman in
front, with several police cars and flashing blue lights.

79
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:48,442
I knew the policeman, so I stopped the car beside him.

80
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:51,962
"What's the matter, John?" I asked.

81
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:53,962
"It's an accident, Sue," he said.

82
00:05:53,962 --> 00:06:00,282
"One car stopped suddenly, and another car went into the
back of it."

83
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:02,562
"Anyone hurt?"

84
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:06,642
Three people, I think, but they don't look too bad.

85
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:10,562
The ambulance will be here soon."

86
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:16,562
"Do you need any help?" I wasn't in uniform, but I had to
ask.

87
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:21,322
He thought for a moment, and I heard the sound of the
ambulance.

88
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:24,242
It was coming towards us.

89
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:40,282
"Well, it looks quite nasty, but we'll be OK when the ambulance comes, Sue. There are two police cars here
already. But you can ask the sergeant over there, if you like. He'll know."

90
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:47,002
"All right, John, thanks." I drove on slowly to the
accident.

91
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:55,202
There was glass all over the road, and the two damaged cars
were by the side of the road on the left.

92
00:06:55,202 --> 00:07:01,522
It seemed that one car had hit the back of the other, and
pushed it off the road.

93
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,642
A young girl was sitting at the side of the road with a
policeman.

94
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:06,962
Her face was covered in blood.

95
00:07:06,962 --> 00:07:13,962
A man was lying on the ground beside the second car, and
another policeman was kneeling beside him.

96
00:07:13,962 --> 00:07:19,882
The sergeant was talking to the driver of the first car, who
was still in his seat.

97
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:21,442
TWO

98
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,522
An accident

99
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:28,482
I parked the car, got out, and went over to the man on the
ground.

100
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:31,682
"Is there anything I can do?" I asked the policeman.

101
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:37,002
He looked up, surprised, and then he recognized me.

102
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:49,643
"Oh, it's you, Sue. I think he's OK. He's breathing, and his
heart's fine. But I don't like the look of that leg."

103
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:54,203
One of the man's legs was broken in two places.

104
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:57,323
It looked like there were two knees.

105
00:07:57,323 --> 00:08:03,323
He was breathing, but his eyes were closed, and his face was
very white.

106
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:07,723
"Can you go and help Chris with the little girl?" he said.

107
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:09,443
"I think this man is her father."

108
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:11,523
I looked at the little girl.

109
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:15,403
She was trying to walk, but she seemed confused.

110
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:19,403
The policeman was holding her arm.

111
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:23,523
I went over and knelt in front of her.

112
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:26,523
There was blood all over her face.

113
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:29,283
I couldn't see her eyes very well.

114
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:31,683
"Hello," I said.

115
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:37,843
"My name's Sue. I'm a police officer. Can you see me?"

116
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:42,683
She wiped her face with her hand, and nodded.

117
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:44,883
"Good," I said.

118
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:46,443
"What's your name?"

119
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,403
"Kate."

120
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:47,963
Kate.

121
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:48,203
OK.

122
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:51,083
Kate, you heard that sound just now, didn't you?

123
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,803
That was the ambulance.

124
00:08:53,803 --> 00:09:03,683
This policeman, Chris, and I are going to take you over to the ambulance, and then the ambulance men will take you to
the hospital and look after you.

125
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:07,443
You're going to be all right."

126
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:09,843
"But what about my daddy?"

127
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:15,843
"He'll come with you in the ambulance. He's going to be all
right, too."

128
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:20,963
I held one of the girl's arms, and Chris held the other.

129
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:32,283
We took the little girl over to the ambulance and sat talking with her while the ambulance men lifted her father
and the other driver into the ambulance.

130
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:34,963
When the ambulance had gone, I spoke to the sergeant for a
few minutes.

131
00:09:34,963 --> 00:09:38,763
"What happened?" I asked.

132
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:41,803
"I don't know yet," he said.

133
00:09:41,803 --> 00:10:12,603
"I think the first car stopped suddenly, but I can't think why. Still, that's something that we'll have to find out.
It's a funny place for an accident. I can only remember one here before - about twenty years ago, I think it was. That was a nasty one, too. A young man was killed - run over by a car. I remember that a little child was hurt then, too."

134
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:15,563
"What happened then?"

135
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:20,043
"He shook his head. "I can't remember now.

136
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:27,483
Anyway, this one'll be your job in the morning - I'm on
holiday next week, remember?

137
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:30,403
Thanks for your help."

138
00:10:30,403 --> 00:10:34,723
On the way back to the car, I could see one of the
policemen.

139
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:39,763
He was picking up the little girl's doll from the side of
the road.

140
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:44,323
He walked over and put it in the police car.

141
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:45,003
THREE

142
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:47,363
A frightened passenger

143
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:51,884
When I got back into the car, the hitch-hiker was still
there.

144
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:57,764
He did look very strange - for a moment, I thought he was
crying.

145
00:10:57,764 --> 00:11:05,444
"I'm sorry," he said, "but I hate accidents. Were... were
they badly hurt?"

146
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:08,284
I looked at him quickly.

147
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:10,924
His face was very pale.

148
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:13,764
And... were his hands shaking?

149
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:16,084
"Quite badly," I said.

150
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:23,724
"One had a broken leg, and the young girl had a lot of glass
in her face. But I think they'll live."

151
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:32,204
"Oh, good. I... I'm sorry I didn't get out, but you see... I
hate seeing blood."

152
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:33,404
I smiled.

153
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:35,324
That's all right.

154
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:41,124
I don't like it either, but I'm a police officer - it's my
job."

155
00:11:41,124 --> 00:11:44,964
"Yes. I suppose you see a lot of accidents?"

156
00:11:44,964 --> 00:12:03,484
"Quite a lot, yes. But it's funny, I've never seen one here before. The road's very straight and it was clear of
traffic, and it's not dark or anything. A car stopped suddenly, and another car hit it. It's very strange."

157
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:09,044
For a moment my passenger didn't answer.

158
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:15,884
He just looked straight in front of him, the grey eyes in
the pale face staring at the road and the traffic.

159
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:18,924
Then he said, very quietly:

160
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:27,164
"Cars do terrible things, don't they? I hate cars. I hate
them!"

161
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,484
I didn't say anything for a minute.

162
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:31,924
Then I asked him if he had a family in Lancaster.

163
00:12:31,924 --> 00:12:41,364
"Yes, I have one son. He's at the University, you know. I'd
been there just now, before you picked me up."

164
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:45,884
"Oh, really? Does he like it there?"

165
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:55,764
"Yes, I think so. Yes, he likes it very much." He smiled at
me - the same grey, pale smile.

166
00:12:55,764 --> 00:13:13,684
"But I still have to look after him, you know. He does silly
things, and gets into lots of trouble. He needs me, you know - I'm sure he'd have an accident if I didn't keep an eye on him all the time."

167
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:17,524
That was a very strange thing to say about a son at
university.

168
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:24,404
My sister is at the University too, but I don't think my
father knows what she's doing every day.

169
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:34,324
I don't think he wants to know - and I'm quite sure she
doesn't want her father "keeping an eye" on her all the
time!

170
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:39,844
But before I could say anything else, we had reached the
centre of the town.

171
00:13:39,844 --> 00:13:43,044
I stopped the car outside the cemetery.

172
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:48,124
"If you want the centre of the town, this is the best
place," I said.

173
00:13:48,124 --> 00:13:52,244
"I'm driving home after this."

174
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:57,565
"This is perfect." He opened the door carefully and got out.

175
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:59,485
Thank you very much.

176
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:01,565
You're very kind."

177
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:12,085
"My pleasure." I watched him walk away, a short, pale man in
that strange, old-fashioned suit.

178
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:16,045
Then I drove out into the traffic and forgot about him.

179
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:17,285
FOUR

180
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:18,525
Where's the body?

181
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:24,845
Next morning, I found the reports of the car accident on my
desk.

182
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:29,845
There were photographs of the two cars after the crash, and
a plan of the area.

183
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:30,885
The two cars had been drawn on the plan.

184
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:34,165
The police had also spoken to two students.

185
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:38,365
They had been walking beside the road at the time of the
accident.

186
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:44,525
The students had both seen the first car swerve suddenly in
front of the second car and then stop, for no reason.

187
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:50,085
But the police hadn't spoken to the drivers of the two cars
because they were too ill.

188
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:53,165
So I had to go to the hospital to talk to them.

189
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:57,885
PC Brian Jones came with me.

190
00:14:57,885 --> 00:15:05,525
The doctors said we couldn't talk to the driver of the second car or the little girl, so we went to see the driver
of the first car.

191
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:06,125
He was sitting up in bed.

192
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:11,565
He could talk now, but he had hurt his neck quite badly
because the car had stopped very quickly.

193
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:15,765
But it seemed that he didn't want to say much.

194
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:18,605
"Good morning, Mr Jackson," I said.

195
00:15:18,605 --> 00:15:23,325
"I'm a police sergeant. The doctor tells me you're feeling
much better this morning."

196
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:24,525
"A bit," he said.

197
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:30,405
"But I still can't move my neck. If you want to talk to me,
sit on the end of the bed, and then I can see you."

198
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:35,245
I sat on the end of the bed and looked at him.

199
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:44,685
He was about thirty years old, with a thin, brown face, a
small moustache, and dark hair.

200
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:52,405
He looked very unhappy, and his eyes always looked away from
me when he spoke.

201
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:58,565
"I suppose you want to know about the accident?" he asked.

202
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:02,365
"That's right, Mr Jackson. Can you remember anything about
it?"

203
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:27,965
"Remember it? Yes, of course I can. I've been thinking about it all night. But it wasn't my fault, honestly. You must
believe me! I was driving along quite slowly - about forty-five miles an hour, I think, or maybe fifty, but no more, really. Anyway, there's no special speed limit on that road, is there?"

204
00:16:27,965 --> 00:16:33,965
"Only the limit for normal roads. You can go up to sixty
miles an hour."

205
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:53,085
"Well, I wasn't driving as fast as that. I was driving quite slowly, the road was clear, and I hadn't been drinking. In
fact, I never drink and drive, never - I'm sure the doctors tested that, didn't they, Officer?"

206
00:16:53,085 --> 00:16:55,485
I looked at my notes.

207
00:16:55,485 --> 00:17:02,926
"Yes, I think so. It doesn't say anything here about
alcohol, Mr Jackson."

208
00:17:02,926 --> 00:17:19,166
"So it couldn't be my fault, could it? I mean, I was going at a normal speed, slowly even, on a sunny day, and I hadn't
been drinking, and then there he was! Right in front of me!"

209
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,806
I felt confused.

210
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:29,406
"I'm sorry, Mr Jackson, I don't understand. Who was in front
of you?"

211
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:31,366
He stared at me strangely.

212
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:37,126
"Well, the man, of course. The man who was killed."

213
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:40,726
Now I was really confused.

214
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:57,726
"What? I'm sorry, Mr Jackson, but no one was killed. The people in the other car were hurt, but they're both alive.
One has a broken leg, I think, and the little girl hurt her face, but that's all."

215
00:17:57,726 --> 00:18:00,046
"Which car?" asked Mr Jackson.

216
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,886
"The car that hit you from behind."

217
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:05,966
Now Mr Jackson looked confused.

218
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:13,246
He looked even more unhappy, and his face went white, as
white as the bandage round his neck.

219
00:18:13,246 --> 00:18:20,206
"Do you mean... are you telling me that a car hit me from
behind, Officer?"

220
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:22,046
"Yes."

221
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:24,446
He put his hands to his neck.

222
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:29,686
He had been trying to shake his head but he couldn't.

223
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:33,566
"I don't remember that," he said.

224
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:39,566
"You don't remember anything about a car that hit you from
behind?"

225
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:52,566
"No, nothing. And you say there were two people in it? A man and a girl? Oh, how terrible." He began to cry, and took a
handkerchief from the table beside his bed.

226
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,006
I thought carefully.

227
00:18:55,006 --> 00:19:13,246
"Let's start from the beginning, Mr Jackson. You say you were driving along slowly, about forty-five miles an hour.
Is that right? Then what happened? Think carefully, and tell me slowly."

228
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:20,526
He put the handkerchief down, and stared at me, his eyes big
and wide.

229
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:42,646
"Well, then I saw him, that's all. A man. He was running across the road in front of me. He didn't look where he was
going, or anything. He was just - there - suddenly. I tried to stop, but it was too late. Poor man - I couldn't miss him!"

230
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:44,846
I waited until he had finished.

231
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:47,646
The nurse gave him a drink of water.

232
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,086
Then I asked, quietly:

233
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:57,646
"Mr Jackson, do you remember anything about this man? I
mean, what did he look like?"

234
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:00,886
He looked at me strangely.

235
00:20:00,886 --> 00:20:32,087
"Well, I didn't have much time, did I? I suppose he was about forty or fifty years old, in a suit or something, I
don't know. His face was very white - I suppose that was because he was frightened. I think he had glasses on, and there was something red - perhaps it was a tie, or maybe it was the blood, I don't know. But why does it matter? You've got the body, haven't you? You know who he is."

236
00:20:32,087 --> 00:20:34,407
I looked at PC Jones.

237
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:41,687
This man's crazy," I thought. "Perhaps he has hurt his head,
too."

238
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:44,127
I felt sorry for him.

239
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:45,927
I spoke very slowly and carefully.

240
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:49,247
I tried to make my voice as kind as I could.

241
00:20:49,247 --> 00:21:02,207
"Mr Jackson, we haven't found a body. No one was killed in the accident. You didn't hit anyone. You just stopped your
car suddenly, and the car behind ran into you, that's all."

242
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:05,447
"But... does that mean you're going to prosecute me?" he
asked.

243
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:09,767
"I'm not sure yet, Mr Jackson," I said.

244
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:23,687
"We haven't finished our investigations. But I'm afraid the police usually prosecute people for dangerous driving if
they stop suddenly for no reason."

245
00:21:23,687 --> 00:21:54,887
"But you can't do that! I'd lose my job! I'm a salesman. I drive hundreds of miles every week, and nobody can work for
our company if they have been prosecuted for dangerous driving. That's why I never drink and drive - never! And I never stop without a good reason! There was a man there, in front of me - I told you! I saw him as clearly as I can see you now!"

246
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:59,847
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr Jackson," I said.

247
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:09,447
"But there was a serious accident, and at the moment it
seems it was your fault. That's all I can say for now."

248
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:10,807
FIVE

249
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:13,607
The doctor explains

250
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:17,567
Outside the room, the nurse stopped us.

251
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:22,527
"Could you both wait in here a moment, please?" she said.

252
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:27,327
"I think the doctor would like to speak to you."

253
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:34,767
We heard the nurse talking to the doctor outside the room
for two or three minutes, and then the doctor came in.

254
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:37,727
She smiled at me.

255
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:41,327
"Good morning, Sergeant Fraser," she said to me.

256
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:45,727
"You've been talking to Mr Jackson, haven't you?"

257
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:47,647
"Yes," I said.

258
00:22:47,647 --> 00:22:50,287
"Poor man - he's not very happy, I'm afraid."

259
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:53,527
"No, of course not," said the doctor.

260
00:22:53,527 --> 00:23:12,647
"Well, it was a nasty accident, wasn't it? And he's hurt his neck quite badly. But the rest of him is OK. He should be
out of hospital in a few days."

261
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:17,768
"Yes." I looked at the doctor carefully.

262
00:23:17,768 --> 00:23:49,608
"Doctor, are you sure that he hasn't hurt anything else? His head, perhaps? You see, I don't think he remembers the
accident very well. He thinks he killed somebody who walked in front of the car, but he didn't. Nobody was killed, nobody walked in front of the car. And he doesn't remember the second car at all."

263
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:52,448
"Yes, I know," she said.

264
00:23:52,448 --> 00:24:21,728
"I wanted to talk to you about that. Of course, people do forget accidents. That's normal. They often don't remember
anything about them. So I'm not surprised that he doesn't remember the second car. But it's very unusual to remember something that didn't happen." She stopped for a moment, and looked at me thoughtfully.

265
00:24:21,728 --> 00:25:01,328
"So I thought... perhaps I shouldn't say this, but I thought you should know. Last night this man had a small problem
with his heart, a very unusual problem. For a few minutes it beat very slowly, it nearly stopped, and then it started again. And people who have a heart problem like that aren't usually allowed to drive, you know, because they might become ill for a couple of minutes, and then of course a car would stop suddenly."

266
00:25:01,328 --> 00:25:03,848
"I see," I said.

267
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:10,648
"So you think that perhaps he had a small heart attack
yesterday, too?"

268
00:25:10,648 --> 00:25:13,968
"I don't know," she said.

269
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:25,688
"Maybe he had the attack because of the accident. I haven't seen his doctor's records, so I don't know if he has ever
had this problem before."

270
00:25:25,688 --> 00:25:28,568
"I see," I said.

271
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:32,648
"Well, thank you, Doctor. That's very helpful."

272
00:25:32,648 --> 00:25:33,928
SIX

273
00:25:34,728 --> 00:25:36,128
A good explanation

274
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:43,568
"That explains it then," said Brian Jones, as we drove back
to the police station.

275
00:25:43,568 --> 00:25:46,928
There wasn't a man in front of his car, and he knows it.

276
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:56,328
I mean, if the man did have this heart problem, then he
couldn't have a job as a salesman, could he?

277
00:25:56,328 --> 00:26:01,528
He wouldn't have a driving license, and he'd lose his job.

278
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:06,288
And he's very afraid of losing his job, isn't he?

279
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:08,088
He told us that."

280
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:09,288
"Yes," I said.

281
00:26:09,288 --> 00:26:13,808
"But that doesn't explain his story, does it?"

282
00:26:13,808 --> 00:26:18,288
"Well, yes, maybe it does, Sergeant," he said.

283
00:26:18,288 --> 00:27:22,929
"Look at it this way. Perhaps this man had a problem with his heart several years ago, and then he got better, so he
got his driving license back. His job and his driving license are very important to him, so he always drives very, very carefully. He never drinks and drives or does anything silly. And why is he so very, very careful? Because he's always afraid that one day his heart problem will come back, and then he'll lose his license, his job, and everything. Then yesterday it did come back, and so he had this accident. But he wants us to believe that it wasn't his fault, so he has invented a story about a man who ran in front of the car. Only it isn't a very good story, that's all, because there wasn't a man, and there isn't a body."

284
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:26,329
Brian Jones smiled at me.

285
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:31,489
He is a young, clever policeman, and he was very pleased
with himself.

286
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:34,849
It was a good explanation, too.

287
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:37,729
I couldn't see anything wrong with it.

288
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:42,409
Back at the police station, I checked everything carefully.

289
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:50,329
But no one had found a body, no one had seen a man who ran
across the road.

290
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:56,689
I looked at the front of Mr Jackson's car carefully with one
of the police scientists.

291
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,889
There were no marks on it at all.

292
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:04,809
Only the back of his car was damaged, where the car behind
had hit it.

293
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:08,249
Either Mr Jackson was mad, or he was lying.

294
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:13,649
But I felt sad, and a little angry, too.

295
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:17,489
The doctor at the hospital had been very helpful, but why
had she told us about Mr Jackson's heart problem?

296
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:18,609
That was wrong.

297
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:24,489
I wouldn't want my doctor to tell people about me when I was
ill.

298
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:31,209
Mr Jackson's story was crazy, but I really think that he
believed it.

299
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:37,969
In my job, you know when people are lying - and I thought Mr
Jackson was telling the truth.

300
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:39,129

00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:47,129
I talked about it with my boyfriend, Simon, at dinner that
night.

303
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:52,129
Simon is a reporter, so he has to be very careful.

304
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:56,249
He must never write about anything I tell him in his
newspaper.

305
00:28:56,249 --> 00:28:58,969
If he did, I would lose my job.

306
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:03,449
But we still talk about things, and sometimes it is very
useful.

307
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:07,889
I told him about the accident, and Mr Jackson's story.

308
00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:10,169
He looked at me thoughtfully.

309
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:17,609
"It's a strange place for an accident, isn't it?" he said.

310
00:29:17,609 --> 00:29:21,569
"The road's very straight there."

311
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:24,369
"That's right," I said.

312
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:30,490
"No one ever stops there. I only stopped because I..."

313
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:35,970
For a moment I stopped talking, my fork in my hand.

314
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,450
"Sue? Sue, what's the matter?" Simon said.

315
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:49,890
"Simon, that's it! I've remembered the thing that worries me
about all this! The hitch-hiker!"

316
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,130
"What?"

317
00:29:51,130 --> 00:30:01,290
"The hitch-hiker! The man Jackson described - pale face,
suit, glasses, red tie. There was a man like that in my
car!"

318
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:07,330
Quickly I told Simon about the man that I had picked up
before I saw the accident.

319
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:19,850
"Yes, but he wasn't dead, Sue - he was in your car, quite safe. And you picked him up a long way away from the
accident."

320
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:35,290
"Not very far away - about half a kilometre, perhaps. The traffic was moving very slowly - because of the accident.
Maybe he walked there. It's possible."

321
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:47,970
"You mean, perhaps the hitch-hiker was walking across the road, and Jackson saw him, stopped his car, and then the
other car hit Jackson's car?"

322
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:59,530
"Yes, that's right! And then the hitch-hiker ran on down the road, and then I picked him up! Simon, I have to find that
man!"

323
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,410
Simon looked thoughtful.

324
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:18,010
"Yes, but wait a minute, Sue. Why would the hitch-hiker cross the road there? There's nothing there. And anyway, if
he was walking towards you, he was walking away from town, not towards it!"

325
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:18,930
I shook my head.

326
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:48,530
"I don't know. But I want to find him. He said he lived in Lancaster. And another thing, Simon. One of the older police
sergeants said there had once been an accident on that road before - something about a child, I think it was - about twenty years ago, maybe more. Can you check in your old newspapers and find out about it? I think it may help."

327
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,570
Simon groaned.

328
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:57,850
"You want me to check the records for a little thing like
that? Do you know how long that takes?"

329
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,370
I smiled at him.

330
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,850
"But you'll do it for me, won't you Simon?" I said.

331
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,450
"Please."

332
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:06,610
EIGHT

333
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,450
Flowers on a grave

334
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:15,930
It took Simon a long time, but he found the newspaper story
in the end.

335
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:23,090
We met for lunch in the park in the middle of town, and he
took it out of his pocket.

336
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:31,810
He showed it to me and I read it carefully - a small yellow piece of paper, a newspaper story about a road accident
eighteen years ago.

337
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,411
FATHER KILLED IN ROAD CRASH

338
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,011
Son saved by brave dad

339
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:43,251
A man was hit by a car and killed in an accident on the main
road outside Lancaster yesterday.

340
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:50,891
Police said the man, twenty-five-year-old Mr David Holland,
ran straight in front of the car.

341
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:57,931
The car driver had no time to stop, and Mr Holland was
killed immediately.

342
00:32:57,931 --> 00:33:03,211
A three-year-old boy, Mr Holland's son Michael, was found by
the side of the road, crying.

343
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:06,491
A woman, Mrs Helen Steadman, was walking with her dog by the
side of the road.

344
00:33:06,491 --> 00:33:14,411
Mrs Steadman said that Mr Holland had been driving towards
Lancaster with his son.

345
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:23,451
Just before the accident he had stopped his car by the side
of the road, and both of them had got out.

346
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:30,451
"I think perhaps the little boy wanted to go to the toilet,"
Mrs Steadman said.

347
00:33:30,451 --> 00:34:01,691
"But before his father could stop him, he ran straight out across the road, in front of the traffic. Mr Holland ran
after him, and managed to pick up the little boy and throw him to the side of the road. But then a car hit the father. It wasn't the driver's, fault - the little boy ran straight out into the road without looking, and his father ran out after him. Then I ran to catch the little boy before he could go back into the road again."

348
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:06,331
The police said that Mr Holland was dead when they arrived.

349
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:10,051
He will be buried in Lancaster cemetery on Tuesday.

350
00:34:10,051 --> 00:34:16,011
The little boy's mother died a year ago, so he will live
with his grandparents in Carnforth,

351
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:23,371
This is the first accident that anyone can remember on this
part of the road.

352
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:27,811
The road is very straight there and is usually very safe.

353
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:30,251
The police do not think the car driver was driving fast.

354
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:35,251
I put down the old yellow piece of paper and thought for a
minute.

355
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:42,051
Eighteen years ago a man had run in front of a car and been
killed, on the same part of the road.

356
00:34:42,051 --> 00:35:00,651
And yesterday, there had been another accident, and the driver of the first car - Mr Jackson - was quite sure that
he had seen a man who had run out in front of him, and was also sure that he had hit him in exactly the same way.

357
00:35:00,651 --> 00:35:05,611
"It's interesting, isn't it?" Simon said.

358
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:11,531
"But it doesn't help much, does it? Have you found your
hitch-hiker yet?"

359
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:14,531
"No," I said.

360
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:27,171
"I've checked all our police records, and we have no records of anyone who looks like him. And of course he didn't tell
me his name."

361
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:29,731
"I see," said Simon strangely.

362
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:33,771
"There is one other interesting thing that I haven't told
you."

363
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:36,331
"Oh? What's that?"

364
00:35:36,331 --> 00:36:17,652
"Well, every day I walk through the cemetery on my way to work. I know the place quite well - sometimes I sit and have
my sandwiches there at lunchtime. And so I notice the other people who come there - the people who put flowers on the graves and eat their lunch there. Sometimes I even read the gravestones, you know. I often wonder about them. What were the people like? How long did they live? It's very interesting."

365
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:24,012
"In your lunch hour? How strange!" I said.

366
00:36:24,012 --> 00:37:05,732
"Do you think so? I like it. It's quiet and peaceful there, so I can think and read. Anyway, there's one grave there
that always has flowers on it. A young man comes to put them there. He's a student, I think. And when I read this newspaper story, I knew I'd seen the name Holland somewhere before. At first I couldn't remember the place that I'd seen it. Then I remembered - it's the name on this gravestone: David Holland! I checked this morning because I wanted to be certain. And the date on the stone was the same too, 1978. It's the same man who was killed in the accident!"

367
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"So?" I asked.

368
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"What's surprising about that? It isn't surprising that he was buried there. He came from Lancaster. And I suppose that
the young man who brings the flowers is his son. That would be normal, wouldn't it?"

369
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Maybe," he said.

370
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"But not every day, not after eighteen years. Anyway, the cemetery is just over there. Why don't we go and have a
look? We can go that way back to the car."

371
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"OK, if you like. I didn't know that you were so interested
in gravestones, Simon."

372
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
We got up and walked quietly through the park and into the
cemetery.

373
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
It was a nice, sunny summer afternoon.

374
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
Neither of us wanted to hurry back to work.

375
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"There it is, look." Simon pointed, and I saw a grave just
like all the others.

376
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
There were a few red flowers on it.

377
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
We walked towards it, but then a young man came past us on
the path.

378
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
He knelt down beside the grave.

379
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
He took the old flowers away, and put some fresh ones beside
it.

380
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
We stopped a few metres away, and watched.

381
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
The young man stayed very quietly beside the grave for
several minutes.

382
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I could see his mouth moving.

383
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
It seemed that he was talking to someone.

384
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"He's praying, Simon," I said.

385
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Come on, let's go. We shouldn't stand and watch him."

386
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"OK," he said, and we moved slowly away.

387
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"But don't you think it's strange?" he asked, while we were
getting into the car.

388
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"I mean, his father has been dead for about twenty years, and this young man comes here nearly every day, with fresh
flowers, and prays beside the grave."

389
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Yes, I suppose it is," I said.

390
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"But that's his business, not ours. And it doesn't help me
with this accident. Come on, let's go."

391
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
NINE

392
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
An unhappy man

393
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
Liter that afternoon I had to meet Mr Jackson.

394
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I didn't want to, but I had to.

395
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
He came into my office unhappily, and sat down in front of
me.

396
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
He still had a bandage around his neck.

397
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Good afternoon, Mr Jackson," I said.

398
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"I'm sorry, but I have investigated this accident very carefully now, and I will have to prosecute you for
dangerous driving."

399
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
His face went white, and I could see his hands begin to
shake.

400
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"But... I'll lose my job," he said.

401
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"You know that, don't you?"

402
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Yes," I said.

403
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"I understand that, and I'm very sorry. But your car swerved and stopped suddenly for no reason, and two people were
badly hurt in the other car. They were lucky. You nearly killed them."

404
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"But what about the man?" he shouted.

405
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"I told you, I saw a man! He crossed the road in front of
me! I'm not crazy, you know - I saw him!"

406
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"I know," I said.

407
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"And I think you believe it yourself. But we've looked for that man, and we can't find him. Two students saw the
accident from the side of the road, you know, but they didn't see a man who crossed the road either. I'm sorry, Mr Jackson, but nobody else saw this man - only you. Perhaps your doctor can explain it, but I can't."

408
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
His hands were shaking even more now, and for a moment he
couldn't speak.

409
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
Perhaps he's going to have a heart attack now, I thought,
here in this room.

410
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
After a moment he stood up and walked to the door.

411
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
At the door he turned and stared at me.

412
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"You..." he began.

413
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"You're wrong! I'm not mad, you know, and I'm not ill either! You wait! One day you'll see something like this,
and no one will believe you either. Then you'll know how I feel!"

414
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
He walked out, shutting the door loudly behind him.

415
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
TEN

416
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
The return

417
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
That Saturday, I had to go to the University.

418
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
My younger sister, Elisabeth, had just finished her studies,
and she was getting her degree.

419
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
My parents had come to watch, and we were all going out for
a meal afterwards.

420
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I put on a nice dress after work and went to the University.

421
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
When I got there, we sat and watched and listened, and then
everyone had tea outside on the grass.

422
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
It was a funny day: all the students were wearing good clothes, instead of their normal jeans and T-shirts, and
they all took their parents round to meet their friends and their friends" parents. Everyone was standing there, talking to strangers and feeling a little embarrassed.

423
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I was just getting myself another cup of tea when I saw him. He was standing there with a cup of tea in his hand, and a
silly smile on his face - the hitch-hiker!

424
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I stood quite still and watched him. He was standing in a group with two young men - students - and two older people.
They talked and smiled for a few minutes, and then the hitch-hiker and one of the students moved away and began to talk to another family group.

425
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"That student is his son!"

426
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I thought.

427
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"And I know him, too! He's the young man we saw in the
cemetery!"

428
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
The hitch-hiker was still very pale and he was still wearing
that old-fashioned suit.

429
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I noticed another strange thing, too - none of the other
parents talked to him.

430
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
In fact, one man nearly walked straight into him.

431
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
But I didn't think much about that, then.

432
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I knew that I had to talk to him - perhaps he could help me
about the accident, even now.

433
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I smiled, and walked towards him.

434
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Hello," I said.

435
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"I didn't think that I'd see you again!"

436
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
He turned quickly, and for a moment I was sure he was
afraid.

437
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
Or perhaps I was the first person who had spoken to him that
afternoon.

438
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
But then he smiled too.

439
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"How nice," he said.

440
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"You're the lady who gave me a lift into town a week ago,
aren't you?"

441
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
So he remembered me, too.

442
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
That was interesting.

443
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
He looked worried.

444
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"But you're a policewoman, aren't you? So you can't be a student, and you're not old enough to be a parent. So why
are you here? Has there been a crime?"

445
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"No," I said.

446
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"My sister's getting her degree, that's all. Is this your
son?"

447
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Yes," he said.

448
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Michael, come and meet my policewoman friend. She gave me a
lift in her car the other day."

449
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
Michael smiled and shook my hand, but I thought he looked a
little nervous.

450
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"That... er... that was very kind of you," he said.

451
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"My father doesn't have a car, and he's always missing the bus. He never manages to catch the bus if I don't take him
to the bus-stop myself."

452
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I didn't know what to say.

453
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"If he's the young man we saw in the cemetery," I thought,
"then his father's dead! But he says this man is his
father!"

454
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
The father smiled again."

455
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
These young people!" he said. They think they know everything. But really it's my son who's always getting into
trouble. I have to look after him all the time, you know."

456
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
People were beginning to go home.

457
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I remembered that the hitch-hiker didn't have a car.

458
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Can I give you another lift back into town?" I asked.

459
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Yes, please," he said.

460
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"That would be very kind. I... I'm getting old, you know. I
get tired when I see too many people."

461
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
The son smiled, and left us.

462
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
We walked to the car.

463
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I didn't speak much.

464
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I was thinking hard.

465
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
What questions should I ask?

466
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
The hitch-hiker got into the car and smiled at me.

467
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"I hope we won't see another accident," he said.

468
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"I hate accidents. All my life, I've been afraid of cars. I'm so glad that Michael isn't going to work near cars or
roads. He's got a job in a bookshop, you know, and he'll be able to walk to work. You can't be farther away from cars than that."

469
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Yes," I said.

470
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
It didn't sound very exciting to me.

471
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Is this job in Lancaster?"

472
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Oh, yes, of course." The man smiled his thin, pale smile.

473
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"He doesn't want to work anywhere else. He comes to see me
every day, you know."

474
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"When I met you the other day, where had you been?" I asked.

475
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"With Michael, of course," he said.

476
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"At the University."

477
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"How did you get there?"

478
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"I walked. It was a nice day."

479
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Did you cross the road about ten minutes before you met
me?" I asked.

480
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Did you walk in front of a car, perhaps?"

481
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
He looked surprised and unhappy.

482
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"No... no, of course I didn't."

483
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Are you sure? Quite sure? Because the driver of one of the
cars saw you, you know."

484
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Saw me? What do you mean?"

485
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"One of the drivers in that accident saw a man, just like you, who walked straight across the road in front of him.
That's why he swerved and stopped. He thought he'd killed you!"

486
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
The man's fingers were playing nervously with the seat-belt,
and his face was whiter than ever.

487
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"Oh, no. That isn't true. I was very careful, and anyway,
nobody can see me when..."

488
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"So you did cross the road?" We were near the centre of the
town now, just outside the cemetery.

489
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I stopped the car and turned to look at the man more
closely.

490
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"I think you'd better come back to the police station with
me. I've got a few more questions to ask, Mr..."

491
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
But then I remembered.

492
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I still didn't know his name.

493
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"It's... er... David. David Holland," he said.

494
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
He was still playing nervously with the seat-belt while he
spoke.

495
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"But I'm afraid I can't come to the police station. Thank
you for the lift. I must go now. Goodbye."

496
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I tried to stop him, but he was going already.

497
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
Going in a way that was not normal at all.

498
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
He had not opened the door, but his leg and half of his body
were already halfway through it.

499
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I couldn't speak, I was too surprised.

500
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
And as I watched, the other parts of his body - that thin, pale body in the strange, old-fashioned clothes - went
through the door as well.

501
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
Through the door, right through the steel car door.

502
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
And then he walked quickly away, and walked straight through
the closed metal gate into the cemetery.

503
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I didn't see where he went.

504
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I was too shocked to move.

505
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
When at last I got out of the car, and walked into the
cemetery, he was not there.

506
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
But there were fresh flowers on the grave under the
gravestone that said:

507
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
David Holland

508
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
1953-1978

509
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
"He gave his life for his son"

510
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I stood by the grave and thought for a long time.

511
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
But I'm only an ordinary policewoman.

512
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,732
I can't arrest dead people, or people who aren't there.

513
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:05,772
I remembered the things poor Mr Jackson had said to me when he left my office, and I wondered what on earth I was going
to do now.
