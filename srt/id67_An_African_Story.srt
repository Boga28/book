CHAPTER ONE
An African Story

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,550
In East Africa there was a young man who was
a hunter, who loved the plains and the valleys

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,219
and the cool nights on the slopes of Mount
Kilimanjaro.

4
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:19,590
In September 1939 war had begun in Europe
and he had travelled over the country to Nairobi

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,910
and was training to be a pilot with the RAF.

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,119
He was doing quite well, but after five weeks
he got into trouble because he took his plane

7
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:33,379
up and flew off in the direction of Nakuru
to look at the wild animals when he should

8
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:36,699
have been practicing spins and turns.

9
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:42,059
While he was flying there, he thought he saw
some rare animals, became excited and flew

10
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,120
down low to get a better view of them.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,239
He flew too low and damaged the wing, but
he managed to get back to the airfield in

12
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,780
Nairobi.

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,869
After six weeks, he was allowed to make his
first cross-country flight on his own, and

14
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:03,199
he flew off from Nairobi to a little town
called Eldoret two thousand meters up in the

15
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,519
Highlands.

16
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,009
But again he was unlucky; this time he had
engine failure on the way, due to water in

17
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:12,320
the fuel tanks.

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,820
He kept calm and made a beautiful forced landing
without damaging his aircraft, not far from

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,530
a little hut which stood alone on the highland
plain with no other building in sight.

20
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,430
That is lonely country up there.

21
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,320
He walked over to the hut, and there he found
an old man, living alone, with only a small

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,759
garden of sweet potatoes, some brown chickens
and a black cow.

23
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,909
The old man was kind to him.

24
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,950
He gave him food and milk and a place to sleep,
and the pilot stayed with him for two days

25
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,499
and two nights, until a rescue plane from
Nairobi found his aircraft, landed beside

26
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:54,759
it, found out what was wrong, went away and
came back with clean petrol which enabled

27
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,990
him to take off and return.

28
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,060
But during his stay, the old man, who was
lonely and had seen no one for many months,

29
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,600
was glad of his company and of the opportunity
to talk.

30
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,009
He talked a lot and the pilot listened.

31
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,110
He talked of his lonely life, of the lions
that came in the night and of the elephant

32
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,280
that lived over the hill in the west, of the
heat of the days and of the silence that came

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,890
with the cold at midnight.

34
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,090
On the second night he talked about himself.

35
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:34,190
He told a long, strange story, and as he told
it, it seemed to the pilot that the old man

36
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,780
was lifting a great weight off his shoulders
by telling it.

37
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,600
When he had finished, he said that he had
never told that to anyone before, and that

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,560
he would never tell it to anyone again, but
the story was so strange that the pilot wrote

39
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,900
it down as soon as he got back to Nairobi.

40
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,920
He wrote it in his own words, although he
had never written a story before.

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,350
Of course he made mistakes because he didn't
know any of the tricks that writers use, but

42
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,480
when he had finished writing he left a rare
and powerful story.

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,120
We found the story in his suitcase two weeks
later when we were packing his things after

44
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,159
he had been killed in training.

45
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,159
The pilot seemed to have had no relatives
and because he was my friend, I took the story

46
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,629
and looked after it for him.

47
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:26,880
This is what he wrote.

48
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,269
The old man came out of the door into the
bright sunshine, and for a moment he leaned

49
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:34,319
on his stick and looked around him.

50
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,610
He stood with his head on one side, looking
up, listening for the noise which he thought

51
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,760
he had heard.

52
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,860
He was small and over seventy years old, although
he looked nearer eighty-five because of illness.

53
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:52,780
His face was covered with grey hair, and when
he moved his mouth, he moved it only on one

54
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,000
side of his face.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,689
On his head, indoors or outdoors, he wore
a dirty white hat.

56
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:05,540
He stood quite still in the bright sunshine,
his eyes almost closed, listening for the

57
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,140
noise.

58
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,720
Yes, there it was again.

59
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,290
He looked towards the small wooden hut which
stood a hundred meters away in the field.

60
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,500
This time there was no doubt about it; the
cry of a dog, the high, sharp cry of pain

61
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,640
which a dog gives when he is in great danger.

62
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,630
Twice more it came and this time the noise
was more like a scream.

63
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,290
The note was higher and sharper, as if it
were torn from some small place inside the

64
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,640
body.

65
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,590
The old man turned and walked across the grass
towards the wooden hut where Judson lived,

66
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,320
pushed open the door and went in.

67
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,220
The small white dog was lying on the floor
and Judson was standing over it, his legs

68
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,670
apart, his black hair falling all over his
long red face, sweating through his dirty

69
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,810
white shirt.

70
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:06,280
His mouth hung open in a strange lifeless
way, as if his jaw were too heavy for him,

71
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,940
and there was spit down the middle of his
chin.

72
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,731
He stood there looking at the small white
dog which was lying on the floor, and with

73
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:23,820
one hand he was slowly twisting his left ear;
in the other hand he held a heavy wooden stick.

74
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,750
The old man ignored Judson and went down on
his knees beside his dog and gently moved

75
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,360
his thin hands over its body.

76
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,270
The dog lay still, looking up at him with
sad eyes.

77
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,240
Judson did not move.

78
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,420
He was watching the dog and the man.

79
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,740
Slowly, the old man got up, rising with difficulty,
holding the top of his stick with both hands

80
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,580
and pulling himself to his feet.

81
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,710
He looked around the room.

82
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,170
There were dirty bedclothes lying on the floor
in the far corner; there was a wooden table

83
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,490
made of old boxes, and on it a blue pot.

84
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,160
There were chicken feathers and mud on the
floor.

85
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,880
The old man saw what he wanted.

86
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,570
It was a heavy iron bar standing against the
wall near the bedding and he went over to

87
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:17,370
it, thumping the hollow wooden floorboards
with his stick as he went.

88
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,150
The eyes of the dog followed his movements
as he walked with difficulty across the room.

89
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,470
The old man changed his stick to his left
hand, took the iron bar in his right, came

90
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,210
back to the dog and, without pausing, lifted
the bar and brought it down hard upon the

91
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,160
animal's head.

92
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,300
He threw the bar to the ground and looked
up at Judson, who was standing there with

93
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,270
his legs apart.

94
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,400
He went right up to him and began to speak.

95
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,500
He spoke very quietly and slowly, with a terrible
anger, and as he spoke he moved only one side

96
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,100
of his mouth.

97
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,580
'You killed him,' he said.

98
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,870
'You broke his back.'

99
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:05,220
Then, as the tide of anger rose and gave him
strength, he found more words.

100
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,710
He looked up and spat them into the face of
the tall Judson, who moved back towards the

101
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,860
wall.

102
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,380
'You dirty, cruel coward.

103
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,490
That was my dog.

104
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,180
What right have you got to beat my dog, tell
me that.

105
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,210
Answer me, you madman.

106
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,140
Answer me.'

107
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,680
Judson was slowly rubbing his left hand up
and down the front of his shirt and now the

108
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,990
whole of his face began to tremble.

109
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:40,260
Without looking up he said, 'He wouldn't stop
licking that place on his leg.

110
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,270
I couldn't stand the noise it made.

111
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,750
You know I can't stand noises like that, licking,
licking, licking.

112
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:53,030
I told him to stop but he went on licking.

113
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:58,510
I couldn't stand it any longer, so I beat
him.'

114
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,480
The old man did not say anything.

115
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,630
For a moment it looked as if he were going
to hit this creature.

116
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:11,590
He half raised his arm, dropped it again,
spat on the floor, turned round and went out

117
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,530
of the door into the sunshine.

118
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:20,060
He went across the grass to where a black
cow was standing in the shade of a small tree.

119
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,530
The cow was eating, moving its jaws regularly,
mechanically, as it watched him walk across

120
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,000
the grass from the hut.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,229
The old man came and stood beside it, stroking
its neck.

122
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:37,649
Then he leaned against its shoulder and scratched
its back with the end of his stick.

123
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:43,449
He stood there for a long time, leaning against
the cow, scratching it with his stick, and

124
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:48,810
now and then he spoke to it, whispering quiet
little words, like one person telling a secret

125
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,379
to another.

126
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:55,810
There was shade under the little tree, and
the country around him looked rich and pleasant

127
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,920
after the long rains, because the grass grows
green up in the Highlands of Kenya, and at

128
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,250
this time of the year, after the rains, it
is as green and rich as any grass in the world.

129
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,430
In the distance stood Mount Kenya with snow
on its head, with a thin stream of what looked

130
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,590
like white smoke coming from the top where
the cold winds made a storm and blew the white

131
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,980
powder from the top of the mountain.

132
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,330
Down below, on the slopes of that mountain,
there were lions and elephants, and sometimes

133
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:35,550
during the night one could hear the roar of
the lions as they looked at the moon.

134
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:41,519
The days passed and Judson went on with his
work on the farm in a silent, mechanical way,

135
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,350
taking in the corn, digging the potatoes and
milking the black cow while the old man stayed

136
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,589
indoors away from the fierce African sun.

137
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,490
He only went out in the late afternoon when
the air began to get cool and sharp, and then

138
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:02,649
he always went over to his black cow and spent
an hour with it under the tree.

139
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:09,600
One day, when he came out, he found Judson
standing beside the cow, looking at it strangely,

140
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,800
standing with one foot in front of the other,
gently twisting his ear with his right hand.

141
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,560
'What is it now?' said the old man.

142
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,600
'The cow's making that noise again.'

143
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,890
'She's just chewing the grass,' said the old
man.

144
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,180
'Leave her alone.'

145
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,470
Judson said, 'It's the noise.

146
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,050
Can't you hear it?

147
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,360
It sounds as if she's chewing stones, but
she isn't.

148
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
Listen to her.

149
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,680
The noise goes right into my head.'

150
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,860
'Get out,' said the old man.

151
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,139
'Get out of my sight.'

152
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:53,040
At dawn the old man sat, as he always did,
looking out of his window, watching Judson

153
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,449
come across from his hut to milk the cow.

154
00:10:56,449 --> 00:11:01,060
He saw him coming sleepily across the field,
talking to himself as he walked, dragging

155
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:07,620
his feet, leaving long dark green marks across
the wet grass, and carrying the petrol can

156
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,449
which he used for the milk.

157
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:17,279
The sun was coming up and making long shadows
behind the man, the cow and the small tree.

158
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,999
The old man saw Judson put the can down and
he saw him fetch a box from beside the tree

159
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:26,220
and settle himself on it, ready for the milking.

160
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,740
He saw him suddenly kneeling down, feeling
under the cow with his hands, and at the same

161
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,600
time the old man noticed that the animal had
no milk.

162
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,889
He saw Judson get up and come walking fast
towards the hut.

163
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:44,999
He came and stood under the window where the
old man was sitting, and looked up.

164
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:49,009
'The cow's got no milk,' he said.

165
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:54,329
The old man leaned through the open window,
placing both his hands on the sill.

166
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:55,750
'You dirty thief!

167
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,550
You've stolen it.'

168
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,250
'I didn't take it,' said Judson.

169
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,300
'I've been asleep.'

170
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,449
'You stole it.'

171
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:08,519
The old man was leaning further out of the
window, speaking quietly with one side of

172
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,199
his mouth.

173
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:14,249
'I'll beat you for this,' he said.

174
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:18,059
Judson said, 'Someone stole it in the night.

175
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:19,970
Perhaps it was a native.

176
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,740
Or maybe the cow's sick.'

177
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,720
It seemed to the old man that he was telling
the truth.

178
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:33,829
'We'll see,' he said, 'if there's any milk
this evening; now, get out of my sight!'

179
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:41,519
By evening, the cow was full and the old man
watched Judson take good thick milk from her.

180
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,959
The next morning she was empty.

181
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:46,579
In the evening she was full.

182
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:50,069
On the third morning she was empty again.

183
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,350
On the third night, the old man went to watch.

184
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,889
As soon as it began to get dark, he positioned
himself at the open window with an old gun

185
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:03,920
lying on his lap, waiting for the thief who
came and milked his cow in the night.

186
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,800
At first it was dark and he could not even
see the cow, but soon a three-quarter moon

187
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,910
came over the hills and it became light, almost
as if it were daytime.

188
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:21,399
But it was bitterly cold because the Highlands
are two thousand meters up, and the old man

189
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,660
pulled his brown blanket closer around his
shoulders.

190
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,000
He could see the cow well now, just as well
as in daylight, and the little tree threw

191
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,550
a shadow across the grass, since the moon
was behind it.

192
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,249
All through the night, the old man sat there
watching the cow, and except when he got up

193
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:45,730
and went back into the room to fetch another
blanket, his eyes never left her.

194
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,970
The cow stood calmly under the small tree,
chewing and staring at the moon.

195
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,240
An hour before dawn she was full.

196
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,269
The old man could see it; he had been watching
it the whole time, and although he had not

197
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:03,769
seen the movement of the swelling, all the
time he had been conscious of the filling

198
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:06,380
as the milk came down.

199
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,040
The moon was now low, but the light had not
gone.

200
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:16,119
He could see the cow and the little tree and
the greenness of the grass around the cow.

201
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:18,829
Suddenly he moved his head quickly.

202
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:20,839
He heard something.

203
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,980
Surely that was a noise he heard?

204
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,670
Yes, there it was again, right under the window
where he was sitting.

205
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:34,380
Quickly he pulled himself up and looked over
the sill to the ground.

206
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,529
Then he saw it.

207
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:42,629
A large black snake, a Mamba, nearly three
meters long and as thick as a man's arm, was

208
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:45,540
sliding towards the cow.

209
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,110
Its small head was raised slightly off the
ground and the movement of its body against

210
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,449
the wetness made a sound like gas escaping
from a jet.

211
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:57,740
He raised his gun to shoot.

212
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:04,240
Almost at once he lowered it again - he didn't
know why - and he sat there not moving, watching

213
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,430
the Mamba as it approached the cow, listening
to the noise it made as it went, watching

214
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,779
it come up close to the cow and waiting for
it to strike.

215
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,069
But it did not strike.

216
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:22,369
It lifted its head and for a moment let it
move gently from side to side; then it raised

217
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:27,550
the front part of its black body into the
air under the cow and began to drink from

218
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,620
her.

219
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,490
The cow did not move.

220
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,179
There was no noise anywhere, and the body
of the Mamba curved gracefully up from the

221
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:38,350
ground and hung under the cow.

222
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:44,240
The black snake and the black cow were clearly
visible out there in the moonlight.

223
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,879
For half an hour the old man watched the Mamba
taking the milk of the cow.

224
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,290
He saw the gentle movement of the snake's
body as it sucked at the liquid until at last

225
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,750
there was no milk left.

226
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,420
Then the Mamba lowered itself to the ground
and slid back through the grass in the direction

227
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,810
from which it had come.

228
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,540
Again it made a soft noise as it went, and
again it passed underneath the window where

229
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:13,249
the old man was sitting, leaving a thin dark
mark in the wet grass where it had gone.

230
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:17,720
Then it disappeared behind the hut.

231
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,470
Slowly the moon went down behind the mountain
in the distance.

232
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,889
Almost at the same time the sun rose in the
east and Judson came out of his hut with the

233
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:31,819
petrol can in his hand, walking sleepily towards
the cow, dragging his feet in the wet grass

234
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:34,009
as he went.

235
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:37,160
The old man watched him coming and waited.

236
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,810
Judson bent down and felt the underneath of
the cow, and as he did so, the old man shouted

237
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,559
at him.

238
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,170
Judson jumped at the sound of the old man's
voice.

239
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,480
'It's gone again,' said the old man.

240
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,119
Judson said, 'Yes, the cow's empty.'

241
00:16:55,119 --> 00:17:00,800
'I think,' said the old man slowly, 'that
it was a native boy.

242
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,150
I was sleeping a bit and only woke up as he
was leaving.

243
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,040
I couldn't shoot because the cow was in the
way.

244
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,510
I'll wait for him tonight.

245
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,120
I'll get him tonight,' he added.

246
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,690
Judson did not answer.

247
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:23,870
He picked up his can and walked back to his
hut.

248
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,870
That night the old man sat up again by the
window, watching the cow.

249
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:34,590
For him there was this time a certain pleasure
in waiting for what he was going to see.

250
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:39,450
He knew that he would see the Mamba again,
but he wanted to be quite sure.

251
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:45,660
And so, when the great black snake slid across
the grass towards the cow an hour before sunrise,

252
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,760
the old man leaned over the window sill and
watched the movements of the Mamba as it approached

253
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,190
the cow.

254
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,430
He saw it wait for a moment under the animal's
stomach, letting its head move slowly backwards

255
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:02,890
and forwards half a dozen times before it
finally raised its body from the ground and

256
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,550
started to drink the milk.

257
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:11,370
He saw it drink for half an hour, until there
was none left, and he saw it lower its body

258
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,900
and slide smoothly back behind the hut from
where it had come.

259
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,960
And while he watched these things, the old
man began laughing quietly with one side of

260
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,680
his mouth.

261
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,030
Then the sun rose up behind the hills, and
Judson came out of his hut with the petrol

262
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:34,390
can in his hand, but this time he went straight
to the window of the hut where the old man

263
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,290
was sitting, wrapped up in his blankets.

264
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,670
'What happened?' said Judson.

265
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,370
The old man looked down at him from the window.

266
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,360
'Nothing,' he said.

267
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,800
'Nothing happened.

268
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,100
I fell asleep again and the native came and
took the milk.

269
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:57,810
Listen, Judson,' he added, 'we have to catch
this boy, otherwise you won't have enough

270
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,810
milk.

271
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,910
We've got to catch him.

272
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:05,520
I can't shoot because he's too clever; the
cow's always in the way.

273
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,200
You'll have to get him.'

274
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,050
'Me get him?

275
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,050
How?'

276
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,240
The old man spoke very slowly.

277
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,910
'I think,' he said, 'I think you must hide
beside the cow.

278
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,690
That is the only way you can catch him.'

279
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,900
Judson was scratching his head with his left
hand.

280
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,400
'Today you will dig a shallow hole beside
the cow.

281
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,650
If you lie in it and if I cover you over with
cut grass, the thief won't notice until he's

282
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,060
beside you.'

283
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,110
'He may have a knife,' Judson said.

284
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,500
'No, he won't have a knife.

285
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,740
You take your stick.

286
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,020
That's all you'll need.'

287
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,090
Judson said, 'Yes, I'll take my stick.

288
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:56,320
When he comes, I'll jump up and beat him with
my stick.'

289
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,860
Then suddenly he seemed to remember something.

290
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,180
'What about the noise the cow makes when she's
chewing?' he said.

291
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,060
'I couldn't stand that noise all night.'

292
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,500
He began twisting at his left ear with his
hand.

293
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:19,880
'You'll do as I tell you,' said the old man.

294
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,510
That day Judson dug his hole beside the cow.

295
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:28,050
The cow was tied to the tree so that she could
not wander around the field.

296
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:33,430
Then, as evening came and he was preparing
to lie down in the hole for the night, the

297
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:38,980
old man came to the door of the house and
said, 'Don't do anything until early morning.

298
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,240
He won't come until the cow's full.

299
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,800
Come in here and wait; it's warmer than your
dirty little hut.'

300
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,310
Judson had never been invited into the old
man's house before.

301
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:56,740
He followed him in, happy that he would not
have to lie all night in the hole.

302
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,060
There was a candle burning in the room.

303
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,130
It was stuck in the neck of a beer bottle
and the bottle was on the table.

304
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,660
'Make some tea,' said the old man.

305
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,830
Judson did as he was told.

306
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,290
The two of them sat down on a couple of wooden
boxes and began to drink.

307
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:19,740
The old man drank his tea hot and made loud
sucking noises as he drank.

308
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,200
Judson kept blowing on his tea, drinking cautiously
and watching the old man over the top of his

309
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,900
cup.

310
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:33,010
The old man kept sucking at his tea until
suddenly Judson said, 'Stop.'

311
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:38,820
He said it quietly, and as he said it, the
corners of his eyes and mouth began to tremble.

312
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,110
'What?' said the old man.

313
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:48,230
Judson said, 'That noise, that sucking noise
you're making.'

314
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:53,300
The old man put down his cup and looked at
the other quietly for a few moments.

315
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,370
Then he said, 'How many dogs have you killed,
Judson?'

316
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,790
There was no answer.

317
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,940
'I said how many?

318
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,150
How many dogs?

319
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,150
Judson!'

320
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,120
the old man shouted.

321
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:15,021
Then quietly and very slowly, like someone
to a child, he said, 'In all your life, how

322
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:19,040
many dogs have you killed?'

323
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,960
Judson said, 'Why should I tell you?'

324
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,410
He did not look up.

325
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,670
'I want to know, Judson.'

326
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,110
The old man was speaking very gently.

327
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,740
'I'm getting interested in this, too.

328
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,060
Let's talk about it and make some plans for
more fun.'

329
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
Judson looked up.

330
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:44,840
A ball of spit rolled down his chin, hung
for a moment in the air and fell to the floor.

331
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,410
'I only kill them because of their noise.'

332
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,830
'How often have you done it?

333
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,320
I'd love to know how often.'

334
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,310
'Lots of times long ago.'

335
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,190
'How?

336
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,980
Tell me how you used to do it.

337
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,120
What way did you like best?'

338
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
No answer.

339
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,890
'Tell me, Judson.

340
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,670
I'd love to know.'

341
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,480
'I don't see why I should tell you.

342
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,070
It's a secret.'

343
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,660
'I won't tell.

344
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,580
I swear I won't tell.'

345
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,010
'Well, if you promise.'

346
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,410
Judson shifted his seat closer and spoke in
a whisper.

347
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:35,830
'Once I waited till one was sleeping, then
I got a big stone and dropped it on his head.'

348
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,600
The old man got up and poured himself a cup
of tea.

349
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,070
'You didn't kill mine like that.'

350
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,940
'I didn't have time.

351
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,630
The noise of its tongue was so bad, the licking.

352
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,090
I just had to do it quickly.'

353
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,990
'You didn't even kill him.'

354
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,420
'I stopped the licking.'

355
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,440
The old man went over to the door and looked
out.

356
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,010
It was dark.

357
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:06,870
The moon had not yet risen, but the night
was clear and cold, with many stars.

358
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:12,250
In the east there was a little paleness in
the sky, and as he watched, the paleness grew

359
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,240
and it changed into brightness.

360
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,010
Slowly, the moon rose over the hills.

361
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,790
The old man turned and said, 'You'd better
get ready.

362
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,920
You never know.

363
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,500
He might come early tonight.'

364
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,300
Judson got up and the two of them went outside.

365
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,000
Judson lay down in the shallow hole beside
the cow and the old man covered him with grass,

366
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,590
so that only his hand showed above the ground.

367
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:42,300
'I'll be watching, too,' he said, 'from the
window.

368
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:49,120
If I give a shout, jump up and catch him.'

369
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,650
He went back to the hut, went upstairs, wrapped
himself in blankets and took up his position

370
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,190
by the window.

371
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,980
It was early still.

372
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,100
The moon was nearly full and it was rising.

373
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,470
It shone on the snow on top of Mount Kenya.

374
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:11,740
After an hour, the old man shouted out of
the window, 'Are you still awake, Judson?'

375
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,640
'Yes,' he answered, 'I'm awake.'

376
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,190
'Don't go to sleep,' said the old man.

377
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,790
'Whatever you do, don't go to sleep.'

378
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:26,050
'The cow's making that noise all the time,'
said Judson.

379
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:31,450
'Good, and I'll shoot you if you get up now,'
said the old man.

380
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,690
'You'll shoot me?'

381
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,840
'I said I'll shoot you if you get up now.'

382
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,950
A gentle noise came from where Judson lay,
a strange sound as if a child were trying

383
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,050
not to cry, and in the middle of it, Judson's
voice.

384
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:50,090
'I've got to move; please let me move.

385
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,610
This chewing!'

386
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:57,780
'If you get up,' said the old man, 'I'll shoot
you in the stomach.'

387
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:05,270
For another hour or so the crying continued,
then quite suddenly it stopped.

388
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,850
Just before four o'clock, it began to get
very cold and the old man shouted, 'Are you

389
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,740
cold out there, Judson?

390
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,230
Are you cold?'

391
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,180
'Yes,' came the answer.

392
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,580
'So cold.

393
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,950
But I don't mind because the cow's not chewing
any more.

394
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,810
She's asleep.'

395
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:29,650
The old man said, 'What are you going to do
with the thief when you catch him?'

396
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,260
'I don't know.'

397
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,240
'Will you kill him?'

398
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,740
A pause.

399
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,980
'I don't know.

400
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,800
I'll just grab him.'

401
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,090
'I'll watch,' said the old man.

402
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,620
'It should be fun.'

403
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,860
He was leaning out of the window with his
arms resting on the sill.

404
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:55,930
Then he heard the soft noise under the window,
looked out and saw the black Mamba, sliding

405
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:01,050
through the grass towards the cow, going fast
and holding its head just a little above the

406
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,840
ground as it went.

407
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,660
When the Mamba was five meters away, the old
man shouted, 'Here he comes, Judson; here

408
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660
he comes.

409
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,790
Go and get him.'

410
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,140
Judson lifted his head quickly and looked
up.

411
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,120
As he did so he saw the Mamba and the Mamba
saw him.

412
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,420
There was a second, or perhaps two, when the
snake stopped, pulled its head back and raised

413
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,610
the front part of its body in the air.

414
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,740
Then the stroke.

415
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:37,430
Just a flash of black and a slight thump as
it hit him in the chest.

416
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:43,880
Judson screamed, a long high scream which
did not rise or fall, but remained constant

417
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,700
until gradually it faded into nothingness
and there was silence.

418
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,940
Now he was standing up, tearing open his shirt,
feeling for the place in his chest, crying

419
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,150
quietly and breathing hard with his mouth
wide open.

420
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:04,810
And the old man sat quietly at the open window,
leaning forward and never taking his eyes

421
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,660
away from the scene below.

422
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:14,461
Everything happens very quickly when one is
bitten by a snake, by a black Mamba, and almost

423
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:17,400
at once the poison began to work.

424
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,610
He fell to the ground, where he lay on his
back, rolling around on the grass.

425
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,820
He no longer made any noise.

426
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:30,410
It was all very quiet, as if a man of great
strength were fighting with someone whom one

427
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:36,030
could not see, and it was as if this invisible
person were twisting him and not letting him

428
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,930
get up, stretching his arms through the fork
of his legs and pushing his knees up under

429
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,110
his chin.

430
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,380
Then he began pulling up the grass with his
hands and soon after that he lay on his back

431
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,260
kicking gently with his legs.

432
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,630
But he didn't last very long.

433
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:59,270
He gave a quick shake, twisted his back, then
lay on the ground quite still, lying on his

434
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:04,580
stomach with his right knee underneath his
chest and his hands stretched out above his

435
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,470
head.

436
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:11,830
Still the old man sat by the window, and even
after it was all over, he stayed where he

437
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,910
was and did not move.

438
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,740
There was a movement in the shadow under the
little tree and the Mamba came forward slowly

439
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,820
towards the cow.

440
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:28,950
It came forward a little, stopped, raised
its head, waited, and slid forward again right

441
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,630
under the stomach of the cow.

442
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,590
It raised itself into the air and began to
drink.

443
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:40,700
The old man sat watching the Mamba taking
the milk of the cow, and once again he saw

444
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:46,240
the gentle movement of its body as it sucked
out the liquid.

445
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,570
While the snake was still drinking, the old
man got up and moved away from the window.

446
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,510
'You can have his share,' he said quietly.

447
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:01,580
'We don't mind you having his share,' and
as he spoke, he glanced back and saw again

448
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,700
the black body of the Mamba curving upwards
from the ground, joining the underneath of

449
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,180
the cow.

450
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,790
'Yes,' he said again, 'we don't mind you having
his share.'

451
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,150
- THE END -
