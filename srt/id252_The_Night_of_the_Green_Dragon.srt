00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,910
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,410
A bad dream

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:18,810
Somewhere a 
telephone was ringing.

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,029
Howard could hear it in his dream, but it
didn't wake him up.

5
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:28,230
It was dark in his dream, dark and terrible.

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,210
He was running, but it was like running through
deep water.

7
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,040
There were trees all around him, trees which
tried to stop him.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,640
They reached out with their branches.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,590
And it was behind him.

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,610
It was coming nearer.

11
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,590
He wanted to shout for help.

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,820
He was opening his mouth wide.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,800
But there was no sound.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,380
He could hear the noise it was making behind
him - the heavy feet, the heavy breathing.

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,010
He was terrified.

16
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,309
He looked behind...

17
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,560
He could see it!

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,820
He could see the burning eyes, the yellow
teeth.

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,049
Oh, no!

20
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,170
It was coming nearer.

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,810
A few more steps and then...

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,700
The telephone was still ringing.

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:16,189
'Don't answer it,' Howard shouted.

24
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:18,040
Suddenly he was awake.

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,710
His body was hot and wet.

26
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,500
The bedclothes were nearly off the bed.

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,030
He was awake and safe.

28
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,490
It was only a dream!

29
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,590
He tried to pull the bedclothes back onto
the bed.

30
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,070
But something was wrong.

31
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,270
His arm felt strange.

32
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,920
He lifted his head, and looked.

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,600
Beside his bed, there was a metal pole.

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,500
There was a tube coming from it.

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,700
His arm was tied to it.

36
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,000
He let his head fall back on the bed.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,290
Then he knew what it was.

38
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,780
He was in hospital.

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,220
But why?

40
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,770
He was probably a patient.

41
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,469
He was ill, or hurt.

42
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,910
Maybe he had been in an accident.

43
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,979
He tried to think, but he couldn't remember.

44
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,600
This happened sometimes after accidents, people
said.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,849
You forgot what had happened just before,
but...

46
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,120
Howard felt cold around his heart.

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,970
He couldn't remember anything...

48
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:29,350
not the accident (but was it an accident?),
not the hospital, not his home, or family

49
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,630
(did he have a family?).

50
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,230
He couldn't even remember his name.

51
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,120
Who was he?

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,020
He didn't know.

53
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,220
He lifted his head again and looked to the
right.

54
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,319
He was in a hospital ward, a long room full
of beds and other patients, men who were sleeping

55
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,200
or reading.

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,629
At one end he could see a nurse.

57
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:56,900
She was speaking into a telephone.

58
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,630
Was that the telephone he had heard?

59
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,340
He looked to the left and he became still
with fear.

60
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,250
A man was sitting on a chair just by his bed.

61
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,350
There was something in his hand, a magazine
or a book.

62
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,390
His head had fallen forward and he was asleep.

63
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,000
Who was he?

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,569
What was he doing here, beside Howard's bed?

65
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,989
Was he a guard?

66
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,939
The man seemed to feel Howard's eyes on him,
because he lifted his head, stood up and looked

67
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:32,330
down at Howard.

68
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:38,239
'So you're awake, Mr Blake,' he said, and
his voice was ugly.

69
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,000
'Have you had a good sleep?

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,690
How's your head?

71
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,939
Is it still hurting?'

72
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:47,709
Who are you?' said Howard.

73
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:49,410
His voice was very quiet.

74
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,410
'What am I doing here?'

75
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,689
'You've had a little accident,' the man said.

76
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:59,409
There's someone here who wants to speak to
you.'

77
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,120
Howard closed his eyes.

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,820
Yes, his head did hurt, but it hurt inside
more than outside.

79
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,090
Why couldn't he remember?

80
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,239
What was happening?

81
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:21,590
He didn't understand.

82
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:29,030
When he opened his eyes, two people were standing
by his bed, his guard and another, older person.

83
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,759
It was a woman with brown hair and cold grey
eyes, wearing a dark blue suit.

84
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,630
They were both looking serious, almost angry.

85
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,880
But why were they angry?

86
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,950
Were they angry with him?

87
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,639
They closed the curtains around his bed and
came inside.

88
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,730
'The Inspector wants to speak to you, Mr Blake,'
said the guard.

89
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,660
The Inspector?

90
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,860
Then these two were police officers.

91
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,960
Had he been in a road accident?

92
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,740
No, Howard knew this wasn't right.

93
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,240
Police inspectors didn't worry about road
accidents.

94
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,210
They were too important.

95
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,650
Then it was a crime!

96
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,650
Perhaps...

97
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,389
perhaps he had been attacked by a thief!

98
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:14,430
'Now, Mr Blake,' the Inspector began.

99
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,470
Her voice was pleasant but it sounded cold.

100
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,569
Why do you call me "Blake"?' said Howard.

101
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,550
He had suddenly felt this was wrong.

102
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,960
'My name isn't Blake.

103
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,550
It's... it's...'

104
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,840
'Come on, Mr Blake,' the Inspector said angrily,
'we know all about you.

105
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,220
Why don't you just answer our questions?

106
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,229
You'll have to, in the end.'

107
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:40,800
Howard was feeling more and more worried.

108
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,319
He wanted to answer their questions, but he
could remember nothing.

109
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,020
'What do you want to know?' he said weakly.

110
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,400
'What time did you arrive at the house in
Primrose Avenue?'

111
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,760
the Inspector said.

112
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,490
Her voice was now hard and quick.

113
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,639
'How did you climb to the window?

114
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,250
What weapon did you use to hit the old lady?

115
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,400
What were you going to do with the green dragon?'

116
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,949
'Stop!

117
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,490
Stop!'

118
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,530
cried Howard.

119
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,300
He felt sick.

120
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,910
He couldn't breathe.

121
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:18,600
He could only hear those last words, 'the
green dragon, the green dragon'.

122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,360
Howard groaned.

123
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
The green dragon!

124
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,669
Those eyes...

125
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:24,740
those burning red eyes!

126
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,410
And then he remembered more.

127
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,580
Red eyes, red blood.

128
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,199
A pool of blood on a Chinese rug...

129
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,270
But he was the one who was hurt.

130
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,080
He was the one who had been attacked, violently.

131
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,479
The detectives - of course, they were detectives
- began to ask their questions again.

132
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,160
They were hard questions.

133
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,190
They were impossible to answer.

134
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,000
'I can't...

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,270
I can't...' said Howard.

136
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,500
'It's no use.

137
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,360
I can't remember.'

138
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,340
He felt like a little boy.

139
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,490
He wanted to cry.

140
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,010
You climbed into the old lady's house in the
dark.

141
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,250
She heard you and went to look.

142
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:14,009
You hit her when she got to the stairs,' the
guard said.

143
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,360
And then the nurse was standing beside them.

144
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,620
'That's enough,' she said angrily.

145
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,449
'He's too ill to answer any more questions.

146
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,440
You'll have to leave.'

147
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,889
She did something to Howard's arm.

148
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,509
He felt himself sinking into sleep.

149
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:35,610
The green dragon, the telephone, the pool
of blood, the old lady...

150
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,300
What had happened?

151
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,289
He didn't know.

152
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:41,830
But he was certain about one thing.

153
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,560
'My name's not Blake,' he said, loudly and
clearly.

154
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,350
Then he slept.

155
00:07:52,350 --> 00:08:01,530
CHAPTER TWO

156
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:06,120
Escape!

157
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,800
Howard was still afraid when he woke up.

158
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,010
It was night and the long ward was silent.

159
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:18,960
Yes, he was still afraid, but he was stronger,
much stronger.

160
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,819
Something was going round and round in his
head.

161
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:26,690
It was something the detective had said, just
before the nurse came.

162
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,879
He looked around the room.

163
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,900
Everyone was sleeping.

164
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,390
He could see the moonlight on their beds.

165
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,390
Moonlight!

166
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,919
That was it!

167
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,940
The guard had said 'in the dark'.

168
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,019
But he was wrong.

169
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,019
It wasn't dark.

170
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,620
It was moonlight, bright moonlight.

171
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,330
Howard sat up in his bed.

172
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,140
He suddenly felt excited.

173
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,670
Was he remembering at last?

174
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,820
But his thoughts were gone before he could
catch them.

175
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,070
He wanted to shout with anger, but he had
seen something.

176
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,450
His arm was free.

177
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,329
The pole and tube had gone and the curtains
were open.

178
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:05,420
Then he noticed something else.

179
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,490
The guard was not there!

180
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,270
Howard tried to control his thoughts.

181
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,770
What did he know so far?

182
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,570
An old lady had been killed, an old lady who
lived in Primrose Avenue.

183
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,190
And the police thought he had killed her.

184
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,000
That name, Primrose Avenue, he'd heard it
before.

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,860
Was the answer there?

186
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,560
Could he find the address if he was free?

187
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,640
Free!

188
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,980
He had to get free.

189
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,300
He had to escape from the hospital.

190
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,579
He had to discover what had really happened,
because he was certain he had not killed anyone.

191
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:44,750
He hadn't... he hadn't done that terrible
thing.

192
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,640
Then he lay back on the bed.

193
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,410
He was feeling weak.

194
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,890
How could he escape?

195
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,060
They had taken away all his clothes.

196
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,810
Suddenly Howard heard voices outside the ward.

197
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,320
He shut his eyes quickly, and lay very still.

198
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,760
He could hear the voices of his guard and
the nurses.

199
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,570
The big doors opened and they came in quickly.

200
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,010
They were pushing a stretcher.

201
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,630
A man was lying on it He was groaning.

202
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,120
'It was just outside the hospital,' the nurse
was saying.

203
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,720
'He walked in front of a bus.'

204
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,140
They put the new patient on the bed next to
Howard's.

205
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,060
Doctors and nurses were all around him.

206
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,350
Then one of the doctors said, 'We'll have
to operate,' and the man was taken away again

207
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,420
on his stretcher.

208
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,220
'I'll go and phone his wife,' said the guard,
and left the ward.

209
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,110
Then it was quiet again.

210
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,430
Howard didn't move for a very long time.

211
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,079
Then slowly he opened his eyes.

212
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,920
The ward was quiet.

213
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,750
The other patients were sleeping again.

214
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,290
He lifted his head and looked at the next
bed.

215
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,560
The man's clothes were still on the chair
by his bed.

216
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,269
They had forgotten to take them away.

217
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:58,480
He wanted to laugh!

218
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,070
Howard got out of bed and stood up carefully.

219
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,990
For a moment he thought he was going to fall.

220
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,990
He shook his head.

221
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,019
Then he felt all right.

222
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,850
He smiled to himself.

223
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,140
He felt strong.

224
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,360
He could do it.

225
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,209
Now he knew he could do it.

226
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:15,200
He could escape!

227
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,870
He dressed in the bathroom.

228
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,670
The man's clothes were a little too small
but he could get them on.

229
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,900
He looked at himself in the mirror.

230
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,089
Now for the difficult part...

231
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:32,510
CHAPTER THREE

232
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:41,930
Inside the old house

233
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,639
But he was lucky.

234
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,290
He saw nobody, and nobody saw him.

235
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,480
He walked quickly out of the ward and out
of the hospital.

236
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,300
Outside, he saw that one of the nurses had
left her bicycle against the wall.

237
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,160
Howard stared at it.

238
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,370
He had a strange feeling that he had done
all this before.

239
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,760
Somehow, a bicycle was important.

240
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,810
But why?

241
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,300
He couldn't remember.

242
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,290
But he knew he could ride a bicycle.

243
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,550
He shook himself, got on the bicycle and rode
away quickly.

244
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,700
Somehow he knew the way.

245
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,180
It was like having a map in his head.

246
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,110
There was Primrose Avenue, and there, yes,
there was the big old house.

247
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,899
It was hidden behind trees.

248
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,089
Howard started to walk up the drive.

249
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,750
It was like the dream.

250
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,810
He knew the way exactly.

251
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,020
He was certain the answers were here, the
answers to all of his questions.

252
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:49,150
Suddenly, he jumped into the shadow of the
trees and stood very still under the branches.

253
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,370
He could hear voices.

254
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,480
He looked out slowly and saw a van, a white
van.

255
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,740
It was parked outside the house.

256
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,649
Two people were standing by it.

257
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,480
They were talking.

258
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,430
They were wearing dark uniforms.

259
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,560
Then he saw who they were.

260
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,560
The police!

261
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,120
Of course!

262
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,389
A woman had been murdered in this house, and
the police were guarding it.

263
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:16,649
He had to be more careful.

264
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,170
He had to go round to the back of the house.

265
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,620
Nobody would be able to see him there.

266
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,420
He crept through the trees silently.

267
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,500
He stayed in the shadows.

268
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,040
Again, he knew the way.

269
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,180
Here was the back of the house and here was
the drainpipe beside the balcony.

270
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,360
He climbed up easily and opened the window.

271
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,790
Somehow he knew it wasn't locked.

272
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,440
He climbed in and stood in the dark.

273
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,170
He was breathing deeply, but he wasn't afraid.

274
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,769
The house felt warm and friendly.

275
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:55,870
He felt his way across the upstairs hall with
his hands.

276
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:03,640
Then he started down the stairs, step by step,
slowly and carefully.

277
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,670
Suddenly he felt afraid...

278
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,180
very afraid.

279
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,220
But why?

280
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,560
The house didn't feel friendly any more.

281
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:20,709
Something was waiting for him downstairs,
something evil and cruel and...

282
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:21,709
Howard cried out.

283
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,210
He was terrified.

284
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,890
Someone was lying on the floor below!

285
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,750
He could see a white shape, with the arms
out at the sides.

286
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:34,950
Then the moon appeared from behind a cloud
and shone through the window.

287
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,130
Howard's legs felt weak.

288
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,480
The body he had seen on the floor had seemed
real.

289
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,040
Was he remembering something or was he just
dreaming it?

290
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,389
He could see clearly now.

291
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,020
It wasn't a body on the rug below.

292
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,980
It was only some white marks.

293
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,660
The police had made white marks on the floor.

294
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,800
They had wanted to show the place... the place
where the body had been.

295
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:10,820
There was nothing to be afraid of, but had
he remembered something else?

296
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:16,060
He looked again, nearer and nearer.

297
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,889
Then he turned away.

298
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:20,500
He was feeling sick.

299
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:27,740
Beside the shape of the head, the rug was
dark, dark with blood.

300
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,920
Howard almost fell down the last steps.

301
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,350
He ran across the hall.

302
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,390
He crashed into tables, chairs and a large,
heavy wooden box.

303
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,610
The moonlight shone on its top.

304
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,640
It was covered with Chinese dragons.

305
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,700
He turned away.

306
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,019
He couldn't breathe.

307
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,769
He had to get outside.

308
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:50,949
He had to get into the cold night air.

309
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:52,470
Suddenly he stopped.

310
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,620
Voices!

311
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,920
He heard the sound of a key in the lock.

312
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,389
He looked around wildly.

313
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,180
He had to hide, but where, where?

314
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,850
The Chinese box...?

315
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,370
No, not there, not with those dragons!

316
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,640
But he had to.

317
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,040
There was nowhere else.

318
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,560
He climbed in.

319
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,970
The voices came nearer and stopped just by
the box.

320
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,040
It was the two police officers Howard had
seen outside.

321
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,990
In the box he tried to breathe quietly.

322
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,509
The voices were clear.

323
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:27,640
'I want you to have a look around,' one was
saying.

324
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,860
'You haven't been here before, have you?'

325
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,560
'What happened exactly?'

326
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,610
the other said.

327
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,180
'The old lady was murdered and...'

328
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,819
Howard thought about the police officer.

329
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:45,120
Was he pointing - to the shape at the bottom
of the stairs, pointing to the dry blood?

330
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,300
But now he was speaking again, 'We've got
the man that did it.

331
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,050
You know that, don't you?

332
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,780
He wanted to steal that dragon.

333
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,709
We think the old lady heard something.

334
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:57,320
Maybe she was watching television.

335
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,089
She came to the bottom of the stairs.

336
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,269
He was coming down silently and when he saw
her... crash!

337
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:04,920
He hit her.

338
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,134
We don't know what he hit her with.

339
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:11,870
He just hit wildly in the dark and ran back
upstairs, and got out through the window.

340
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,429
But this time he made a mistake.

341
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:17,240
He slipped and fell.'

342
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,079
In the box Howard was listening very carefully
to every word.

343
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,059
Was he hearing the true story now?

344
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:27,419
He thought carefully.

345
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,190
Why couldn't he remember?

346
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,289
'... in the dark', the police officer had
said.

347
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:35,570
No, that was wrong.

348
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,890
It wasn't dark.

349
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,390
But how did he know this?

350
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,169
Why was it important?

351
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:44,640
'The cleaner found him the next morning.

352
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,169
He was unconscious under the balcony.

353
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:50,510
He was sleeping like a baby, but he'd hurt
his head.

354
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,440
The dragon was on the ground beside him.'

355
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,540
Their voices were getting weaker.

356
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,340
They were going away.

357
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,159
Howard waited... fifteen minutes, twenty minutes.

358
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,409
Then he opened the top of the box a little.

359
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:12,299
Everything was still outside, still and dark.

360
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,890
The moon was hidden again.

361
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,400
He climbed out.

362
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,970
He tried to be very quiet.

363
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,590
The room was very dark, and he couldn't see
anything.

364
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:30,660
He held his hands in front of him and moved
one foot slowly, then the other.

365
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,669
If he could switch on the light, just for
a minute, he would be able to see the shape

366
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:38,050
of the room... and the doors.

367
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,980
His hands touched something hard.

368
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,980
The wall!

369
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,980
Good.

370
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,539
If he followed the wall, he would find the
door.

371
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:50,080
Yes, here it was and here was the handle.

372
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,480
Howard suddenly felt light and happy.

373
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,270
In a second he was going to be in the fresh
air.

374
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,670
And he was going to be free from the heavy
walls of this house.

375
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,460
They seemed like a prison to him now.

376
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,970
He had to go to the police.

377
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,200
He had to tell them they were wrong, terribly
wrong about him.

378
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,000
He opened the door and stepped quickly through
the doorway...

379
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:24,860
CHAPTER FOUR

380
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:34,809
The green dragon

381
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:41,309
When Howard became conscious again, he was
lying on a hard and dirty floor, and every

382
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:43,880
bone in his body ached.

383
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,990
He tried to move but the pain was too much.

384
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,429
What had happened?

385
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:53,710
This place was darker than upstairs.

386
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,659
Upstairs?

387
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:57,360
Then he remembered.

388
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,960
He had opened a door and suddenly he was falling,
crashing from step to step until he reached

389
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,200
the bottom and... blackness.

390
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,590
'Just like the last time,' Howard thought.

391
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,460
Then he sat up.

392
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,080
The last time!

393
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,070
Yes, now he remembered!

394
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,120
He had been to this house before.

395
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,550
He had seen the old lady.

396
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:36,090
She was lying on the floor in a pool of blood
but... did he kill her?

397
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,580
It had been about six o'clock when Freddy
came.

398
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,299
Howard was just finishing his tea.

399
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:46,570
He groaned when he saw Freddy.

400
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:51,360
Freddy was his brother-in-law and he had been
married to Howard's sister, Helen, for nine

401
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,330
years, but Howard didn't like him.

402
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,130
He had never liked him.

403
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,280
He had always been suspicious of Freddy.

404
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,700
He thought that Freddy wasn't really honest.

405
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,140
He didn't know why he thought that, but he
did.

406
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,940
It was just something about Freddy.

407
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,340
He didn't seem to have a job but he always
had a big car and expensive clothes.

408
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,820
Helen and the two children seemed to have
everything they needed, but...

409
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,630
Howard got up when Freddy came into the room.

410
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,620
Freddy was white and nervous.

411
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,640
He went quickly to the window and looked out.

412
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,340
Did he think someone else was coming?

413
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,260
'You've got to help me, Howard,' he said.

414
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,390
'I'm in trouble, bad trouble.'

415
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,799
Howard put down his teacup.

416
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,730
'What can I do?' he said carefully.

417
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,200
You had to be careful with Freddy.

418
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,860
Freddy's hands were shaking when he lit his
cigarette.

419
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,669
'I need money, a lot of money.'

420
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:52,380
Howard started to speak but Freddy continued
quickly.

421
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,520
'I know, I know.

422
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,980
You haven't got any money.

423
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,010
But you can help me.'

424
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,289
He was looking at Howard nervously.

425
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:02,559
'How?' said Howard angrily.

426
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,909
'If this is one of your wild plans, the answer
is "No".

427
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,120
I'm not going to help you in any crime.'

428
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,650
'It's only a little thing,' Freddy said.

429
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,870
He put out his cigarette.

430
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,679
'One phone call, that's all.

431
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,390
There are some men...' He looked nervously
out of the window again.

432
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,539
'What men?' said Howard.

433
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:24,650
'Criminals, you mean?'

434
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,539
'It's better if you don't know,' Freddy said
quickly.

435
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:31,130
'They're not... gentlemen.'

436
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,419
The word sounded strange, when Freddy said
it.

437
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,040
When they're angry, they're dangerous...

438
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,309
very dangerous.

439
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:40,770
They're going to...'

440
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,350
Suddenly Freddy covered his face with his
hands.

441
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,930
Howard saw that he was shaking and jumped
to his feet.

442
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,730
He put his hand on Freddys arm.

443
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,200
Maybe he didn't like Freddy but he was his
brother-in-law.

444
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,610
Freddy looked up.

445
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,000
He was terrified.

446
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,830
'You've got to save me, Howard,' he said.

447
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,780
His voice was shaking.

448
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,990
'You're the only friend I've got.

449
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,039
If they don't get their money soon, they'll...

450
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,990
they'll kill me!'

451
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,070
For a few minutes he could not continue.

452
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,820
He was too frightened.

453
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:22,710
'If I'm killed, what will happen to Helen,
and the children?' he whispered.

454
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,680
He knew just how to hurt Howard.

455
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,800
'No husband, no father.

456
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,500
Soon there'll be no house, no money.

457
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,520
They'll be out on the street...'

458
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,890
His voice was getting louder and louder.

459
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,390
'All right, all right,' said Howard.

460
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,340
He was trying to stay calm.

461
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,809
'What do you want me to do?'

462
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:49,260
Freddy's plan was easy and it didn't seem
dangerous for Howard.

463
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,659
'There's an old lady...' he began.

464
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:59,770
Her name was Miss Blake and she lived in a
big old house on the north side of the town.

465
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,549
The house was hidden behind tall trees.

466
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:08,900
She had lived in the Far East for many years
and when she came back, she was a rich woman.

467
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,730
Her house was full of valuable things.

468
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:17,260
Most of them were too heavy to move, but then
there was the green dragon...

469
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,340
'Dragon?'

470
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,510
Howard said.

471
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,679
He laughed.

472
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,850
'What dragon?'

473
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:31,179
It was made of green jade and gold, Freddy
had told him, with red jewel eyes, and diamonds

474
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,200
on its tail.

475
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,590
It stood in a special place in her bedroom
and it was lit by bright lights.

476
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,490
He knew all about it, because he had been
talking to her cleaner at the pub.

477
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,179
'It's worth thousands of pounds,' Freddy said.

478
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,340
He was excited now.

479
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,020
He was enjoying this.

480
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,720
'Maybe hundreds of thousands.

481
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,490
And it's light enough to carry, and small
enough to hide!'

482
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,220
He wanted Howard to do one thing...

483
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,510
just one thing.

484
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,970
You phone the old lady,' Freddy explained.

485
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,970
'You tell her that a packet has arrived at
your address, Primrose Road.'

486
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,440
'But this isn't Pr...'

487
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Howard began.

488
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
'I know, I know.

489
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,029
You just say it's Primrose Road,' Freddy said
quickly.

490
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:17,919
'Her address is Primrose Avenue - it's nearly
the same, isn't it?

491
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,440
You say your name is Blake, the same as hers.

492
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,419
You say that the stamp on the packet says
"Singapore" and inside it there is some special

493
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:27,419
tea.

494
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,010
You think there has been a mistake.

495
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:34,590
You find her name in the phone book and decide
the packet has come to the wrong address.'

496
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,940
He looked at Howard.

497
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,390
'Do you understand?' he asked.

498
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,770
'Yes, yes.

499
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,990
Go on!' said Howard.

500
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,700
He wanted to hear the end.

501
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,360
Well, it's easy,' Freddy continued.

502
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,211
You tell her you would like to bring the packet
round to her house, but you can't walk, you're

503
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:54,289
in a wheelchair.

504
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:56,780
And you are just going away on three weeks'
holiday.

505
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,020
In fact, your daughter is coming soon to take
you to the airport.

506
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:06,160
Then you ask Miss Blake, would she like to
wait three weeks or would she like to call

507
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,900
round at your house immediately and get the
packet herself?'

508
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,399
'But maybe she'll wait three weeks,' Howard
said.

509
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:17,179
He didn't like the sound of Freddys plan.

510
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:18,980
But he was interested now.

511
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,200
'She won't,' said Freddy.

512
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,559
'She'll want her packet.

513
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,100
She'll leave the house immediately because
she'll want to catch you before you go.

514
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,409
And I'll be outside her house.

515
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:33,039
As soon as she leaves, I'll get into the house,
I'll get the green dragon, and I'll get out.

516
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,149
If'll be easy.

517
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:38,590
If'll be like taking sweets from a baby.'

518
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,760
Howard felt unhappy.

519
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,940
But what could he do?

520
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,010
'I'll bring the dragon back to you,' Freddy
was saying now.

521
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,620
You can hide it here.'

522
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,620
'Here?'

523
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,620
Howard cried.

524
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,620
He was frightened.

525
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,620
Why here?

526
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,380
What's wrong with your house?'

527
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,830
'The children,' Freddy said.

528
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,440
He looked away from Howard's eyes.

529
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,570
They may find it.

530
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,210
Also, I want to hide it from those men.

531
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,659
They won't look here.'

532
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,779
Freddy's plan worked perfectly.

533
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:13,650
Howard was terrified when he heard the old
lady's voice on the phone.

534
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,679
He had hoped she would not answer.

535
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,970
But she did.

536
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:25,880
One hour later the green dragon was on his
dining table.

537
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,309
It was staring at him with those hot, red
eyes.

538
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:35,539
He hated it from the moment he saw it.

539
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:39,630
Howard had sat and studied the dragon for
hours.

540
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:45,059
He was drinking coffee, black coffee, and
smoking cigarette after cigarette.

541
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:48,440
At dinner time he couldn't eat.

542
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,120
When he thought about food, he felt sick.

543
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,419
Strange things were happening to his head.

544
00:27:54,419 --> 00:28:01,510
Once, with a shaking hand, he had touched
the dragon again, but he pulled his hand away

545
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,510
quickly.

546
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,809
It had seemed red-hot.

547
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:07,419
'I'm going crazy,' he thought.

548
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:11,269
I will go crazy if I have to keep that thing
much longer.'

549
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:14,580
He lit another cigarette nervously.

550
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,520
Had someone seen Freddy, someone who knew
him?

551
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,570
Had those men - those dangerous criminals
- been following Freddy?

552
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,450
Had they seen him at Howard's house?

553
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,680
The police had probably interviewed everybody
who had worked for Miss Blake.

554
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,870
Had the cleaner told them that she had talked
to Freddy?

555
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,640
The questions went round and round in his
head.

556
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,220
'I was stupid,' he told himself.

557
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:42,340
Why didn't I throw Freddy and his crazy ideas
out of the house?'

558
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,990
Suddenly he jumped to his feet.

559
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,970
This had to stop.

560
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,220
There was only one answer.

561
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:55,480
He had to take the dragon back...

562
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:04,659
CHAPTER FIVE

563
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:15,730
A body in the moonlight

564
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,049
Howard lay alone in the cellar below the house.

565
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,970
He felt tired.

566
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:25,320
But he felt better because he could remember
the true story.

567
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:31,010
It was like living through the story again,
the fears, the terrible moments, like the

568
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,490
moment when the police stopped him...

569
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:42,620
'Yes,' he thought, 'I remember...'

570
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:50,450
Very late that night he had taken the dragon
back to Miss Blake's house.

571
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,990
He had put it into his bicycle bag and had
started to ride through the silent streets

572
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,360
in the moonlight.

573
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,990
Moonlight - that was unlucky.

574
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,570
It had been dark earlier.

575
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,910
Well, he couldn't do anything about that.

576
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:11,540
He had turned into Primrose Avenue... and
there was a police car!

577
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,630
The two officers in the car were immediately
suspicious of this lonely cyclist in the early

578
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,320
hours of the morning.

579
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,059
They stopped him and asked what he was doing.

580
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:24,630
'I'm going to my mother's,' said Howard.

581
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,370
He was shaking inside.

582
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,820
'They phoned me and said she was ill.'

583
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,990
The police officer wanted to help.

584
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,029
Leave your bicycle,' she said.

585
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:34,740
'We'll drive you there.'

586
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,360
'No, no,' said Howard.

587
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,700
He was feeling hot and uncomfortable.

588
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,390
'She's... my mother's house is just here,
around the corner.

589
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,390
But thank you.

590
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,309
Thank you very much.'

591
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:49,360
He got on his bicycle and rode away.

592
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,470
He heard the police car's engine.

593
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,620
He didn't look back.

594
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,600
The sound of the police car moved away.

595
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,860
Howard breathed normally again.

596
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,539
A few minutes later he found Miss Blake's
house.

597
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:07,050
It looked strange and frightening in the moonlight.

598
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,880
It seemed to be waiting for him.

599
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,040
Was it a trap?

600
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,700
For a moment Howard wanted to turn back but
he told himself not to be silly.

601
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,700
It was late.

602
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,270
The old lady was asleep.

603
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,230
He didn't need to be afraid.

604
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:26,230
Freddy had told him that he had dressed like
a window cleaner and had climbed up his ladder

605
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,960
to a balcony.

606
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,679
The balcony led to the upstairs hall.

607
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,740
He had planned to break a window but he found
the window was open.

608
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,269
Now Howard saw the same window.

609
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,820
He had no ladder but there was a drainpipe.

610
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,649
He could climb it.

611
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:48,409
Soon he was inside, and he was standing at
the top of the stairs in the moonlight.

612
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:50,260
He was looking down.

613
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,419
He mustn't wake Miss Blake.

614
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:55,250
He must leave the dragon somewhere.

615
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,190
Perhaps on the table in the hall?

616
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,910
He could see it below him.

617
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:03,800
Then his heart froze in his body.

618
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,620
There was someone lying at the bottom of the
stairs!

619
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:13,980
A body... a real body... and the moonlight
was shining on the pool of blood.

620
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,460
And then he had run...

621
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,250
back to the open window, to the drainpipe...

622
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,290
The dragon was still in his hand!

623
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,299
He started to throw it away with a wild cry.

624
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:25,299
He slipped.

625
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:27,320
The air was rushing past.

626
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,570
The dragon was falling with him.

627
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,850
Its eyes were staring, its mouth was open
and its teeth were shining...

628
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,440
Was it screaming, like him?

629
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,450
CHAPTER SIX

630
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:51,289
Guilty or not guilty?

631
00:32:51,289 --> 00:33:00,610
'It wasn't a dream,' Howard told himself now,
in the cellar.

632
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,010
It really had happened.

633
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:07,440
He had seen Miss Blake's body, but he hadn't
killed her.

634
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,690
She was already dead when he first saw her.

635
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,220
He thought about the dragon again.

636
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:20,279
He could almost see those red eyes shining
in the dark.

637
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,600
Then Howard went cold inside.

638
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,510
There were eyes shining in the dark...

639
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,350
here, in this cellar!

640
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,409
They were watching him.

641
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,080
Dragon's eyes?

642
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,600
No, rats!

643
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,559
He was terrified of rats.

644
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,559
He felt around with his hands and found some
pieces of wood.

645
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,740
He threw them at the shining eyes, and shouted
as loudly as he could.

646
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,250
Suddenly a voice came from above.

647
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,380
Who's that?

648
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,620
What's happening down there?'

649
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,789
It was a police officer.

650
00:33:52,789 --> 00:34:00,500
'Help me,' Howard said weakly.

651
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:09,649
'Please help me.'

652
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:15,909
I.ater, the Inspector was sitting beside his
bed.

653
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:19,580
She looked serious, but happier.

654
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:25,940
Howard was in hospital again, and he was clean
and warm and comfortable.

655
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,770
He was glad that it was all finished.

656
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,800
They knew who he really was - Howard Thomson.

657
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,060
They weren't calling him 'Blake' any more.

658
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,649
Howard told them everything.

659
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:41,830
Well, nearly everything.

660
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,550
He couldn't say anything about Freddy.

661
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,389
He was thinking of his sister Helen and the
children.

662
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:51,640
He didn't want to hurt them.

663
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,130
'Yes, I stole the green dragon,' Howard told
the Inspector.

664
00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:01,790
'I tricked the old lady with my story about
a packet of tea, and she left the house.'

665
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,570
'Oh, yes?' said the Inspector, and stared
at him.

666
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,790
We found a note.

667
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,780
Miss Blake left it by the telephone.

668
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,230
It said "Mr Blake, Primrose Road".

669
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,420
Your story isn't quite true, is it?

670
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,950
You tricked the old lady - yes.

671
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,500
But she let you into the house that evening.

672
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,230
She didn't leave the house.

673
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,609
And when she tried to stop you from taking
the dragon, you...'

674
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:27,940
'No, no!

675
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,050
That's not true.

676
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,710
It was afternoon, not evening.'

677
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,800
Howard had to stay calm.

678
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,550
He had to say he was the thief, not Freddy.

679
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,099
He spoke slowly, carefully.

680
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,540
'She left the house in the middle of the afternoon.

681
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,020
I went in and stole the dragon.

682
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,890
That's what happened, Inspector.

683
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,170
I didn't kill her.

684
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:57,310
I couldn't kill anyone - she was already dead
when I saw her for the first time.'

685
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:01,290
'Already dead?' the Inspector said quickly.

686
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,630
'Yes, I...'

687
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,040
Howard saw that he had made a mistake.

688
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,590
He had to explain.

689
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:12,030
'I went back that night,' he said.

690
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,790
'You went back?'

691
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,600
The Inspector didn't believe him.

692
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,570
'Why did you do that?'

693
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:23,599
'I wanted to return the dragon, Inspector.'

694
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,670
The words sounded weak and stupid.

695
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:31,930
'I was afraid of it, I don't know why, but
it terrified me.'

696
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:40,220
'Oh, yes?' said the Inspector again, and looked
hard at Howard with her cold, grey eyes.

697
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,079
She was silent for a long time.

698
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,940
Howard tried to think of something.

699
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,900
What could he say?

700
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,180
He had to show the Inspector that he was not
guilty of murder.

701
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,950
But he could not find the right words.

702
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:58,750
'I suppose it's just possible,' the Inspector
said.

703
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:03,960
'Perhaps the old lady went upstairs that evening
and found the dragon was missing.

704
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,520
Then perhaps she rushed to the telephone for
help and fell down the stairs, and hit her

705
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,610
head on the hall table at the bottom.'

706
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,349
'Yes, yes,' said Howard.

707
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:12,420
'That's it!

708
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,859
She was killed by her fall.

709
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,400
Don't you see, Inspector?

710
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,130
I didn't kill her.'

711
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,920
The Inspector was still looking at him suspiciously.

712
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,190
Howard thought hard.

713
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,290
Somewhere there was an answer.

714
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,770
'But you were there,' the Inspector was saying.

715
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,860
You say you went back to the house that evening.

716
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:38,040
You were in the right place, at the right
time, weren't you?'

717
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,100
Time!

718
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,859
Howard sat up and smiled.

719
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,000
'What time, Inspector?' he said.

720
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,270
He was excited now.

721
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:48,119
'What time did Miss Blake die?'

722
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,619
'The doctor says it was about eight o'clock
in the evening,' said the Inspector.

723
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:56,040
'When it was dark,' said Howard.

724
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,619
'When it was still dark.

725
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,060
Before the moon had risen.

726
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:06,020
But I was seen near her house in the moonlight
- at two o'clock in the morning!

727
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:10,110
If I was a murderer, I wouldn't go back there,
would I, Inspector?'

728
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:14,390
'Who saw you?' said the Inspector, still suspicious.

729
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,390
'Friends of yours?

730
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,980
I don't think I'm going to believe any friends
of...'

731
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,119
'You'll believe these people, Inspector,'
said Howard quickly.

732
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,050
Two police officers in a police car saw me
in Primrose Avenue.

733
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,450
Right place, right time, Inspector!'

734
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,819
Howard felt pleased with himself.

735
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:34,770
He lay back on the hospital bed and smiled.

736
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,670
But the Inspector hadn't finished.

737
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,010
'I've got something here.

738
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:43,660
I want you to see it,' she said.

739
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:51,540
She opened a box beside her chair and lifted
something out.

740
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,329
Howard's face went white.

741
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:58,810
The Inspector was holding the green dragon
in her hands.

742
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,690
'It doesn't look very important, does it?'

743
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,540
she said.

744
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,869
The Inspector was right.

745
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:07,200
Howard stared at the dragon.

746
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,560
It didn't look important in the daylight.

747
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,210
It looked cheap and ugly.

748
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:16,710
'It's not real, you know,' the Inspector was
saying.

749
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,710
'What...

750
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,410
what do you mean?' said Howard.

751
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:24,180
He felt cold inside.

752
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,980
The old lady sold the real one years ago.

753
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,070
She wasn't as rich as people said.

754
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,329
She needed the money.

755
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:35,960
But the green dragon had some special magic
for her, and she had this copy made.'

756
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,240
'You mean...'

757
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,240
'Yes.

758
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,089
It's not jade and jewels.

759
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:43,410
It's just plastic and bits of glass.

760
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:49,990
You'd be able to sell it for 20 pound(s),
25 pound(s) if you were lucky.'

761
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,990
She smiled.

762
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:55,579
It was a very cold smile, Howard thought.

763
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:57,520
'It's not much money...

764
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,339
not for five years in prison,' the Inspector
added.

765
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:03,339
'Five years?'

766
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:05,339
Howard said.

767
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:09,320
His voice sounded weak and frightened.

768
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,700
Five years in prison... and Freddy was going
to be free!

769
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,450
'Well, four then,' said the Inspector.

770
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:28,450
She smiled her terrible smile again, '... if
you're lucky.'
