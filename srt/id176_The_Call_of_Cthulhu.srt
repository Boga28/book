00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,760
Of such great powers or beings there may 
be conceivably a survival… a survival of  

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,440
a hugely remote period when… consciousness 
was manifested, perhaps, in shapes and forms  

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,400
long since withdrawn before the tide of advancing 
humanity… forms of which poetry and legend alone  

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:41,520
have caught a flying memory and called them gods, 
monsters, mythical beings of all sorts and kinds…

I. The Horror In Clay

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,080
The most merciful thing in the world, I think, 
is the inability of the human mind to correlate  

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:08,480
all its contents. We live on a placid island of 
ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity,  

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,000
and it was not meant that we should voyage far. 
The sciences, each straining in its own direction,  

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,600
have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the 
piecing together of dissociated knowledge will  

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,520
open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and 
of our frightful position therein, that we shall  

16
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:40,480
either go mad from the revelation or flee from the 
light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,040
Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur 
of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human  

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:57,120
race form transient incidents. They have hinted 
at strange survivals in terms which would freeze  

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:04,880
the blood if not masked by a bland optimism. But 
it is not from them that there came the single  

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,040
glimpse of forbidden eons which chills me when 
I think of it and maddens me when I dream of it.  

21
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,760
That glimpse, like all dread glimpses 
of truth, flashed out from an accidental  

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,480
piecing together of separated things 
- in this case an old newspaper item  

23
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,720
and the notes of a dead professor. I hope that 
no one else will accomplish this piecing out;  

24
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,480
certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly 
supply a link in so hideous a chain.  

25
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,200
I think that the professor, too intented 
to keep silent regarding the part he knew,  

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,440
and that he would have destroyed his 
notes had not sudden death seized him.

27
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,000
My knowledge of the thing began in the winter 
of 1926-27 with the death of my great-uncle,  

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,280
George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus 
of Semitic Languages in Brown University,  

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,480
Providence, Rhode Island. Professor 
Angell was widely known as an authority on  

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,760
ancient inscriptions, and had frequently been 
resorted to by the heads of prominent museums;  

31
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,840
so that his passing at the age of 
ninety-two may be recalled by many.  

32
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,920
Locally, interest was intensified by 
the obscurity of the cause of death.  

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,040
The professor had been stricken whilst returning 
from the Newport boat; falling suddenly;  

34
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,040
as witnesses said, after having been jostled by 
a nautical-looking negro who had come from one of  

35
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,480
the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside 
which formed a short cut from the waterfront to  

36
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,200
the deceased’s home in Williams Street. Physicians 
were unable to find any visible disorder,  

37
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,240
but concluded after perplexed debate that some 
obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk  

38
00:03:52,240 --> 00:04:00,640
ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, 
was responsible for the end. At the time I saw no  

39
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,760
reason to dissent from this dictum, but latterly 
I am inclined to wonder - and more than wonder.

40
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,200
As my great-uncle’s heir and executor, for he died 
a childless widower, I was expected to go over  

41
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,800
his papers with some thoroughness; and for that 
purpose moved his entire set of files and boxes  

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,400
to my quarters in Boston. Much of the material 
which I correlated will be later published by  

43
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,880
the American Archaeological Society, but there 
was one box which I found exceedingly puzzling,  

44
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:44,320
and which I felt much averse from showing to other 
eyes. It had been locked and I did not find the  

45
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,520
key till it occurred to me to examine the personal 
ring which the professor carried in his pocket.  

46
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Then, indeed, I succeeded in opening it, but when 
I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater  

47
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,600
and more closely locked barrier. For what could 
be the meaning of the queer clay bas-relief and  

48
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,480
the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings 
which I found? Had my uncle, in his latter years  

49
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,200
become credulous of the most superficial 
impostures? I resolved to search out the  

50
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,840
eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent 
disturbance of an old man’s peace of mind.

51
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,880
The bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an 
inch thick and about five by six inches in area;  

52
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,280
obviously of modern origin. Its designs, 
however, were far from modern in atmosphere  

53
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,320
and suggestion; for, although the vagaries 
of cubism and futurism are many and wild,  

54
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,560
they do not often reproduce that cryptic 
regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing.  

55
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,440
And writing of some kind the bulk of 
these designs seemed certainly to be;  

56
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,360
though my memory, despite much the papers 
and collections of my uncle, failed in any  

57
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,160
way to identify this particular species, 
or even hint at its remotest affiliations.

58
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,920
Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a 
figure of evident pictorial intent, though its  

59
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,480
impressionistic execution forbade a very clear 
idea of its nature. It seemed to be a sort of  

60
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,720
monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a 
form which only a diseased fancy could conceive.  

61
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:35,600
If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination 
yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus,  

62
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,120
a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be 
unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy,  

63
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,560
tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and 
scaly body with rudimentary wings; but  

64
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,600
it was the general outline of the whole 
which made it most shockingly frightful.  

65
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,920
Behind the figure was a vague suggestions 
of a Cyclopean architectural background.

66
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,160
The writing accompanying this oddity was, 
aside from a stack of press cuttings,  

67
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,680
in Professor Angell’s most recent hand; 
and made no pretense to literary style.  

68
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,600
What seemed to be the main document was headed 
“CTHULHU CULT” in characters painstakingly  

69
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,800
printed to avoid the erroneous reading of a word 
so unheard-of. This manuscript was divided into  

70
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,080
two sections, the first of which was headed 
“1925 - Dream and Dream Work of H.A. Wilcox,  

71
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:41,040
7 Thomas St., Providence, R. I.”, and the 
second, “Narrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse,  

72
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:49,920
121 Bienville St., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. 
A. S. Mtg. - Notes on Same, & Prof. Webb’s Acct.”  

73
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,320
The other manuscript papers were brief notes, some 
of them accounts of the queer dreams of different  

74
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,080
persons, some of them citations from theosophical 
books and magazines (notably W. Scott-Elliot’s  

75
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:09,360
Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria ), and the rest 
comments on long-surviving secret societies and  

76
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,440
hidden cults, with references to passages in such 
mythological and anthropological source-books as  

77
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,920
Frazer’s Golden Bough and Miss Murray’s Witch-Cult 
in Western Europe. The cuttings largely alluded  

78
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:31,120
to outr mental illness and outbreaks of 
group folly or mania in the spring of 1925.

79
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,240
The first half of the principal manuscript told 
a very particular tale. It appears that on March  

80
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:48,960
1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and 
excited aspect had called upon Professor Angell  

81
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:56,480
bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was 
then exceedingly damp and fresh. His card bore  

82
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,960
the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle 
had recognized him as the youngest son of an  

83
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,600
excellent family slightly known to him, who 
had latterly been studying sculpture at the  

84
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,960
Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at 
the Fleur-de-Lys Building near that institution.  

85
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,960
Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius 
but great eccentricity, and had from chidhood  

86
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,000
excited attention through the strange stories 
and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating.  

87
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,000
He called himself “psychically hypersensitive”, 
but the staid folk of the ancient commercial city  

88
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,880
dismissed him as merely “queer.” Never mingling 
much with his kind, he had dropped gradually  

89
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,200
from social visibility, and was now known only 
to a small group of esthetes from other towns.  

90
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,680
Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve 
its conservatism, had found him quite hopeless.

91
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,960
On the ocassion of the visit, ran the professor’s 
manuscript, the sculptor abruptly asked for the  

92
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,720
benefit of his host’s archeological knowledge in 
identifying the hieroglyphics of the bas-relief.  

93
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,640
He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which 
suggested pose and alienated sympathy;  

94
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,000
and my uncle showed some sharpness in replying, 
for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet  

95
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,200
implied kinship with anything but archeology. 
Young Wilcox’s rejoinder, which impressed my uncle  

96
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,000
enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, 
was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have  

97
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,440
typified his whole conversation, and which I 
have since found highly characteristic of him.  

98
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,720
He said, “It is new, indeed, for I made it 
last night in a dream of strange cities;  

99
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,440
and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the 
contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon.”

100
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,120
It was then that he began that rambling tale which 
suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won  

101
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,600
the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been 
a slight earthquake tremor the night before,  

102
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,240
the most considerable felt in New England for some 
years; and Wilcox’s imagination had been keenly  

103
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,640
affected. Upon retiring, he had had an 
unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of  

104
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:31,120
Titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping 
with green ooze and sinister with latent horror.  

105
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,280
Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, 
and from some undetermined point below had come a  

106
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:45,840
voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation 
which only fancy could transmute into sound,  

107
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,320
but which he attempted to render 
by the almost unpronounceable  

108
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,120
jumble of letters: “Cthulhu fhtagn.”

109
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,880
This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection 
which excited and disturbed Professor Angell.  

110
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,520
He questioned the sculptor 
with scientific minuteness;  

111
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,120
and studied with frantic intensity the bas-relief 
on which the youth had found himself working,  

112
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,280
chilled and clad only in his night clothes, 
when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him.  

113
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:27,120
My uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterwards 
said, for his slowness in recognizing both  

114
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,600
hieroglyphics and pictorial design. Many of 
his questions seemed highly out of place to his  

115
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,800
visitor, especially those which tried to connect 
the latter with strange cults or societies;  

116
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,840
and Wilcox could not understand the repeated 
promises of silence which he was offered in  

117
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,480
exchange for an admission of membership in some 
widespread mystical or paganly religious body.  

118
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,480
When Professor Angell became convinced that the 
sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system  

119
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:04,160
of cryptic lore, he besieged his visitor with 
demands for future reports of dreams. This bore  

120
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,720
regular fruit, for after the first interview the 
manuscript records daily calls of the young man,  

121
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,880
during which he related startling fragments 
of nocturnal imaginery whose burden was always  

122
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,520
some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and 
dripping stone, with a subterrene voice or  

123
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:31,600
intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical 
sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish.  

124
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:40,000
The two sounds frequently repeated are those 
rendered by the letters “Cthulhu” and “R’lyeh.”

125
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,880
On March 23, the manuscript continued, Wilcox 
failed to appear; and inquiries at his quarters  

126
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,400
revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure 
sort of fever and taken to the home of his family  

127
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:59,040
in Waterman Street. He had cried out in the night, 
arousing several other artists in the building,  

128
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,000
and had manifested since then only 
alternations of unconsciousness and delirium.  

129
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,800
My uncle at once telephoned the family, and from 
that time forward kept close watch of the case;  

130
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,840
calling often at the Thayer Street office of 
Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to be in charge.  

131
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,200
The youth’s febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling 
on strange things; and the doctor shuddered now  

132
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:29,040
and then as he spoke of them. They included not 
only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed,  

133
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,800
but touched wildly on a gigantic thing 
“miles high” which walked or lumbered about.

134
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,760
He at no time fully described this 
object but occasional frantic words,  

135
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,320
as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the 
professor that it must be identical with  

136
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,480
the nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict 
in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this object,  

137
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,680
the doctor added, was invariably a prelude 
to the young man’s subsidence into lethargy.  

138
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,080
His temperature, oddly enough, 
was not greatly above normal;  

139
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,600
but the whole condition was otherwise such as to 
suggest true fever rather than mental disorder.

140
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,800
On April 2 at about 3 P.M. every trace 
of Wilcox’s malady suddenly ceased.  

141
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,040
He sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself 
at home and completely ignorant of what had  

142
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,400
happened in dream or reality since the night 
of March 22. Pronounced well by his physician,  

143
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,480
he returned to his quarters in three days; but to 
Professor Angell he was of no further assistance.  

144
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,720
All traces of strange dreaming had vanished with 
his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of  

145
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,320
his night-thoughts after a week of pointless and 
irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions.

146
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,680
Here the first part of the manuscript ended, 
but references to certain of the scattered  

147
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,640
notes gave me much material for thought - so much, 
in fact, that only the ingrained skepticism then  

148
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,040
forming my philosophy can account for 
my continued distrust of the artist.  

149
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,360
The notes in question were those descriptive 
of the dreams of various persons covering the  

150
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,000
same period as that in which young Wilcox had had 
his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had  

151
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,080
quickly instituted a prodigiously far-flung body 
of inquires amongst nearly all the friends whom he  

152
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,200
could question without impertinence, asking for 
nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates  

153
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,400
of any notable visions for some time past. The 
reception of his request seems to have varied;  

154
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,120
but he must, at the very least, have received 
more responses than any ordinary man could  

155
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,480
have handled without a secretary. This original 
correspondence was not preserved, but his notes  

156
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,720
formed a thorough and really significant digest. 
Average people in society and business - New  

157
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,840
England’s traditional “salt of the earth” - 
gave an almost completely negative result,  

158
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,080
though scattered cases of uneasy but formless 
nocturnal impressions appear here and there,  

159
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:16,560
always between March 23 and and April 2 
- the period of young Wilcox’s delirium.  

160
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,480
Scientific men were little more affected, though 
four cases of vague description suggest fugitive  

161
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,560
glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case 
there is mentioned a dread of something abnormal.

162
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,240
It was from the artists and poets 
that the pertinent answers came,  

163
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,360
and I know that panic would have broken 
loose had they been able to compare notes.  

164
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,920
As it was, lacking their original letters, I 
half suspected the compiler of having asked  

165
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,800
leading questions, or of having edited the 
correspondence in corroboration of what  

166
00:17:52,800 --> 00:18:00,000
he had latently resolved to see. That is why I 
continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognizant  

167
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,480
of the old data which my uncle had possessed, 
had been imposing on the veteran scientist.  

168
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:13,520
These responses from esthetes told disturbing 
tale. From February 28 to April 2 a large  

169
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,320
proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre 
things, the intensity of the dreams being  

170
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,400
immeasurably the stronger during the period of the 
sculptor’s delirium. Over a fourth of those who  

171
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,480
reported anything, reported scenes and half-sounds 
not unlike those which Wilcox had described; and  

172
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,160
some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the 
gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last.  

173
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,560
One case, which the note describes with 
emphasis, was very sad. The subject,  

174
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:49,280
a widely known architect with leanings toward 
theosophy and occultism, went violently insane  

175
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,280
on the date of young Wilcox’s seizure, and expired 
several months later after incessant screamings to  

176
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:03,440
be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my 
uncle referred to these cases by name instead of  

177
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,400
merely by number, I should have attempted some 
corroboration and personal investigation; but  

178
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:15,760
as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a 
few. All of these, however, bore out the notes  

179
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,760
in full. I have often wondered if all the the 
objects of the professor’s questioning felt  

180
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,040
as puzzled as did this fraction. It is well 
that no explanation shall ever reach them.

181
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,960
The press cuttings, as I have 
intimated, touched on cases of panic,  

182
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,120
mania, and eccentricity during the given period. 
Professor Angell must have employed a cutting  

183
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,600
bureau, for the number of extracts was tremendous, 
and the sources scattered throughout the globe.  

184
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,080
Here was a nocturnal suicide in London, where 
a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after  

185
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,400
a shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter 
to the editor of a paper in South America, where  

186
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,120
a fanatic deduces a dire future from visions he 
has seen. A dispatch from California describes a  

187
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:10,320
theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse 
for some “glorious fulfiment” which never arrives,  

188
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:17,440
whilst items from India speak guardedly of serious 
native unrest toward the end of March 22-23.

189
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:24,400
The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild 
rumour and legendry, and a fantastic painter  

190
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:31,760
named Ardois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous Dream 
Landscape in the Paris spring salon of 1926.  

191
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,120
And so numerous are the recorded troubles in 
insane asylums that only a miracle can have  

192
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,560
stopped the medical fraternity from noting strange 
parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions.  

193
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,760
A weird bunch of cuttings, all told; 
and I can at this date scarcely envisage  

194
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,760
the callous rationalism with which I set 
them aside. But I was then convinced that  

195
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,840
young Wilcox had known of the older 
matters mentioned by the professor.

196
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:19,680
II. The Tale of Inspector Legrasse. 

197
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,080
The older matters which had made the sculptor’s 
dream and bas-relief so significant to my uncle  

198
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,840
formed the subject of the second half 
of his long manuscript. Once before,  

199
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,400
it appears, Professor Angell had seen the 
hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity,  

200
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,200
puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics, 
and heard the ominous syllables which  

201
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:50,000
can be rendered only as “Cthulhu” ; and all 
this in so stirring and horrible a connexion  

202
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,920
that it is small wonder he pursued young 
Wilcox with queries and demands for data.

203
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,480
This earlier experience had come 
in 1908, seventeen years before,  

204
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,720
when the American Archaeological Society held its 
annual meeting in St. Louis. Professor Angell,  

205
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,880
as befitted one of his authority and attainments, 
had had a prominent part in all the deliberations;  

206
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,520
and was one of the first to be approached by 
the several outsiders who took advantage of  

207
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,840
the convocation to offer questions for correct 
answering and problems for expert solution.

208
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,800
The chief of these outsiders, and in a short time 
the focus of interest for the entire meeting,  

209
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:39,040
was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had 
travelled all the way from New Orleans for certain  

210
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:48,560
special information unobtainable from any local 
source. His name was John Raymond Legrasse, and  

211
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:56,320
he was by profession an Inspector of Police. With 
him he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque,  

212
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,640
repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone 
statuette whose origin he was at a loss to  

213
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,720
determine. It must not be fancied that Inspector 
Legrasse had the least interest in archaeology.  

214
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,840
On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was 
prompted by purely professional considerations.  

215
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:20,560
The statuette, idol, fetish, or whatever it 
was, had been captured some months before in  

216
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:27,040
the wooded swamps south of New Orleans during 
a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting; and so  

217
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,400
singular and hideous were the rites connected 
with it, that the police could not but realise  

218
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,800
that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally 
unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic  

219
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:46,080
than even the blackest of the African voodoo 
circles. Of its origin, apart from the erratic  

220
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,680
and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured 
members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered;  

221
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,280
hence the anxiety of the police for any 
antiquarian lore which might help them  

222
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,240
to place the frightful symbol, and through 
it track down the cult to its fountain-head.

223
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:10,880
Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the 
sensation which his offering created. One sight of  

224
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,000
the thing had been enough to throw the assembled 
men of science into a state of tense excitement,  

225
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,280
and they lost no time in crowding around him 
to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter  

226
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:29,760
strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity 
hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas.  

227
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:37,360
No recognised school of sculpture had animated 
this terrible object, yet centuries and even  

228
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,920
thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim 
and greenish surface of unplaceable stone.

229
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,640
The figure, which was finally passed slowly 
from man to man for close and careful study,  

230
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,160
was between seven and eight inches in height, 
and of exquisitely artistic workmanship.  

231
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:05,920
It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid 
outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face  

232
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:14,000
was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking 
body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet,  

233
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,480
and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, 
which seemed instinct with a fearsome and  

234
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,920
unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated 
corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular  

235
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:37,520
block or pedestal covered with undecipherable 
characters. The tips of the wings touched the back  

236
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,840
edge of the block, the seat occupied the centre, 
whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up,  

237
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,440
crouching hind legs gripped the front edge and 
extended a quarter of the way down toward the  

238
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,960
bottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was 
bent forward, so that the ends of the facial  

239
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,880
feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws 
which clasped the croucher’s elevated knees.  

240
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,800
The aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, 
and the more subtly fearful because its source  

241
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:17,360
was so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, 
and incalculable age was unmistakable; yet  

242
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,880
not one link did it shew with any known type of 
art belonging to civilisation’s youth - or indeed  

243
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:30,880
to any other time. Totally separate and apart, 
its very material was a mystery; for the soapy,  

244
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,960
greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent 
flecks and striations resembled nothing familiar  

245
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,280
to geology or mineralogy. The characters along the 
base were equally baffling; and no member present,  

246
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,320
despite a representation of half the world’s 
expert learning in this field, could form the  

247
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,960
least notion of even their remotest linguistic 
kinship. They, like the subject and material,  

248
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,680
belonged to something horribly remote and distinct 
from mankind as we know it. something frightfully  

249
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:08,720
suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in 
which our world and our conceptions have no part.

250
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,840
And yet, as the members severally shook 
their heads and confessed defeat at the  

251
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,960
Inspector’s problem, there was one man 
in that gathering who suspected a touch  

252
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,360
of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape 
and writing, and who presently told with some  

253
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:34,560
diffidence of the odd trifle he knew. This 
person was the late William Channing Webb,  

254
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:43,120
Professor of Anthropology in Princeton University, 
and an explorer of no slight note. Professor Webb  

255
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,800
had been engaged, forty-eight years before, in a 
tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some  

256
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,680
Runic inscriptions which he failed to unearth; 
and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast  

257
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:00,560
had encountered a singular tribe or cult of 
degenerate Esquimaux whose religion, a curious  

258
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:07,120
form of devil-worship, chilled him with its 
deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It  

259
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,680
was a faith of which other Esquimaux knew little, 
and which they mentioned only with shudders,  

260
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,480
saying that it had come down from horribly 
ancient aeons before ever the world was made.  

261
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:26,800
Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there 
were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed  

262
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:34,400
to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk; and of this 
Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy  

263
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:41,040
from an aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing 
the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew how.  

264
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,280
But just now of prime significance was 
the fetish which this cult had cherished,  

265
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,280
and around which they danced when the 
aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs.  

266
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,600
It was, the professor stated, a 
very crude bas-relief of stone,  

267
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,520
comprising a hideous picture and some 
cryptic writing. And so far as he could tell,  

268
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,840
it was a rough parallel in all essential features 
of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting.

269
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,440
This data, received with suspense and astonishment 
by the assembled members, proved doubly exciting  

270
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,000
to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at 
once to ply his informant with questions.  

271
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,720
Having noted and copied an oral ritual among 
the swamp cult-worshippers his men had arrested,  

272
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,720
he besought the professor to remember as best 
he might the syllables taken down amongst the  

273
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,280
diabolist Esquimaux. There then followed an 
exhaustive comparison of details, and a moment  

274
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:52,000
of really awed silence when both detective 
and scientist agreed on the virtual identity  

275
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,560
of the phrase common to two hellish rituals 
so many worlds of distance apart. What,  

276
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:03,120
in substance, both the Esquimaux wizards and 
the Louisiana swamp-priests had chanted to  

277
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,080
their kindred idols was something very 
like this: the word-divisions being  

278
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,160
guessed at from traditional breaks 
in the phrase as chanted aloud:

279
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:24,640
“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu 
R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn.”

280
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,120
Legrasse had one point in advance 
of Professor Webb, for several among  

281
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,320
his mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what 
older celebrants had told them the words meant.  

282
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,080
This text, as given, ran something like this:

283
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,960
“In his house at R’lyeh dead 
Cthulhu waits dreaming.”

284
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,400
And now, in response to a 
general and urgent demand,  

285
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:55,760
Inspector Legrasse related as fully as possible 
his experience with the swamp worshippers;  

286
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,080
telling a story to which I could see my 
uncle attached profound significance. It  

287
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,000
savoured of the wildest dreams of myth-maker and 
theosophist, and disclosed an astonishing degree  

288
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,560
of cosmic imagination among such half-castes and 
pariahs as might be least expected to possess it.

289
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,840
On November 1st, 1907, there had come to the 
New Orleans police a frantic summons from  

290
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,480
the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The 
squatters there, mostly primitive but good-natured  

291
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,640
descendants of Lafitte’s men, were in the grip 
of stark terror from an unknown thing which had  

292
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,880
stolen upon them in the night. It was voodoo, 
apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort  

293
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,240
than they had ever known; and some of their women 
and children had disappeared since the malevolent  

294
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,160
tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within 
the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured.  

295
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:01,760
There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, 
soul-chilling chants and dancing devil-flames;  

296
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,920
and, the frightened messenger added, 
the people could stand it no more.

297
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,480
So a body of twenty police, filling two carriages 
and an automobile, had set out in the late  

298
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,720
afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. 
At the end of the passable road they alighted,  

299
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,160
and for miles splashed on in silence through 
the terrible cypress woods where day never came.  

300
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,680
Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish 
moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank  

301
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:38,000
stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified 
by its hint of morbid habitation a depression  

302
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,800
which every malformed tree and every fungous 
islet combined to create. At length the squatter  

303
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:51,040
settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in 
sight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster  

304
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:58,080
around the group of bobbing lanterns. The muffled 
beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible far, far  

305
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:05,840
ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent 
intervals when the wind shifted. A reddish glare,  

306
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,560
too, seemed to filter through pale undergrowth 
beyond the endless avenues of forest night.  

307
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,360
Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of 
the cowed squatters refused point-blank to advance  

308
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,240
another inch toward the scene of unholy worship, 
so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues  

309
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,800
plunged on unguided into black arcades of 
horror that none of them had ever trod before.

310
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,720
The region now entered by the police was one of 
traditionally evil repute, substantially unknown  

311
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:46,160
and untraversed by white men. There were legends 
of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight,  

312
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:53,920
in which dwelt a huge, formless white polypous 
thing with luminous eyes; and squatters whispered  

313
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,280
that bat-winged devils flew up out of caverns 
in inner earth to worship it at midnight.  

314
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,640
They said it had been there before d’Iberville, 
before La Salle, before the Indians, and before  

315
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:14,240
even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods. 
It was nightmare itself, and to see it was to die.  

316
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:23,440
But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to 
keep away. The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on  

317
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:30,800
the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that 
location was bad enough; hence perhaps the very  

318
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,600
place of the worship had terrified the squatters 
more than the shocking sounds and incidents.

319
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,280
Only poetry or madness could do justice 
to the noises heard by Legrasse’s men  

320
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,880
as they ploughed on through the black morass 
toward the red glare and muffled tom-toms.  

321
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,800
There are vocal qualities peculiar to men, 
and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts;  

322
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:04,400
and it is terrible to hear the one when the source 
should yield the other. Animal fury and orgiastic  

323
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,960
license here whipped themselves to daemoniac 
heights by howls and squawking ecstacies that  

324
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:18,160
tore and reverberated through those nighted woods 
like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell.  

325
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,440
Now and then the less organized 
ululation would cease, and from what  

326
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:38,880
seemed a well-drilled chorus of hoarse voices 
would rise in sing-song chant that hideous  

327
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,848
phrase or ritual:

328
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:43,920
“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu 
R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn.”

329
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,440
Then the men, having reached a spot where 
the trees were thinner, came suddenly in  

330
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:56,160
sight of the spectacle itself. Four of them 
reeled, one fainted, and two were shaken into  

331
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:03,520
a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy 
fortunately deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water  

332
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,120
on the face of the fainting man, and all stood 
trembling and nearly hypnotised with horror.

333
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,920
In a natural glade of the swamp stood a 
grassy island of perhaps an acre’s extent,  

334
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:22,560
clear of trees and tolerably dry. On 
this now leaped and twisted a more  

335
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,520
indescribable horde of human abnormality than 
any but a Sime or an Angarola could paint.  

336
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:38,480
Void of clothing, this hybrid spawn were braying, 
bellowing, and writhing about a monstrous  

337
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,560
ring-shaped bonfire; in the centre of which, 
revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of  

338
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,880
flame, stood a great granite monolith some eight 
feet in height; on top of which, incongruous in  

339
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,680
its diminutiveness, rested the noxious carven 
statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds  

340
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:04,240
set up at regular intervals with the flame-girt 
monolith as a centre hung, head downward,  

341
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:12,160
the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters 
who had disappeared. It was inside this circle  

342
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,960
that the ring of worshippers jumped and roared, 
the general direction of the mass motion being  

343
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,560
from left to right in endless Bacchanal between 
the ring of bodies and the ring of fire.

344
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:30,800
It may have been only imagination and it may have 
been only echoes which induced one of the men,  

345
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:37,360
an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard 
antiphonal responses to the ritual from some  

346
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:46,640
far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of 
ancient legendry and horror. This man, Joseph D.  

347
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:54,400
Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved 
distractingly imaginative. He indeed went so far  

348
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:02,000
as to hint of the faint beating of great wings, 
and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous  

349
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,360
white bulk beyond the remotest trees but I suppose 
he had been hearing too much native superstition.

350
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,840
Actually, the horrified pause of the 
men was of comparatively brief duration.  

351
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:23,600
Duty came first; and although there must have been 
nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the throng,  

352
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,560
the police relied on their firearms and 
plunged determinedly into the nauseous  

353
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,600
rout. For five minutes the resultant din 
and chaos were beyond description. Wild  

354
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,440
blows were struck, shots were 
fired, and escapes were made;  

355
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,080
but in the end Legrasse was able to count some 
forty-seven sullen prisoners, whom he forced to  

356
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:53,120
dress in haste and fall into line between two rows 
of policemen. Five of the worshippers lay dead,  

357
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:58,000
and two severely wounded ones were carried away on 
improvised stretchers by their fellow-prisoners.  

358
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,160
The image on the monolith, of course, was 
carefully removed and carried back by Legrasse.

359
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,840
Examined at headquarters after a trip of intense 
strain and weariness, the prisoners all proved  

360
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:18,560
to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and 
mentally aberrant type. Most were seamen,  

361
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,400
and a sprinkling of Negroes and mulattoes, largely 
West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape  

362
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,800
Verde Islands, gave a colouring of 
voodooism to the heterogeneous cult.  

363
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,840
But before many questions were asked, 
it became manifest that something  

364
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:41,360
far deeper and older than Negro fetishism was 
involved. Degraded and ignorant as they were,  

365
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:47,360
the creatures held with surprising consistency 
to the central idea of their loathsome faith.

366
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,040
They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old 
Ones who lived ages before there were any men,  

367
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:03,040
and who came to the young world out of the sky. 
Those Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth  

368
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,880
and under the sea; but their dead bodies had 
told their secrets in dreams to the first men,  

369
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:16,720
who formed a cult which had never died. This 
was that cult, and the prisoners said it had  

370
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,360
always existed and always would exist, hidden in 
distant wastes and dark places all over the world  

371
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:31,040
until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, 
from his dark house in the mighty city of R’lyeh  

372
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:38,480
under the waters, should rise and bring the earth 
again beneath his sway. Some day he would call,  

373
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,600
when the stars were ready, and the secret 
cult would always be waiting to liberate him.

374
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,840
Meanwhile no more must be told. There was a 
secret which even torture could not extract.  

375
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,880
Mankind was not absolutely alone 
among the conscious things of earth,  

376
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,800
for shapes came out of the dark to visit the 
faithful few. But these were not the Great  

377
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:16,560
Old Ones. No man had ever seen the Old Ones. The 
carven idol was great Cthulhu, but none might say  

378
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:23,360
whether or not the others were precisely like him. 
No one could read the old writing now, but things  

379
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:30,320
were told by word of mouth. The chanted ritual 
was not the secret - that was never spoken aloud,  

380
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:39,200
only whispered. The chant meant only this: “In 
his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.”

381
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,400
Only two of the prisoners were found sane enough 
to be hanged, and the rest were committed to  

382
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,640
various institutions. All denied a part in the 
ritual murders, and averred that the killing had  

383
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,360
been done by Black Winged Ones which had come to 
them from their immemorial meeting-place in the  

384
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:07,840
haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no 
coherent account could ever be gained. What the  

385
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:14,400
police did extract, came mainly from the immensely 
aged mestizo named Castro, who claimed to have  

386
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,480
sailed to strange ports and talked with undying 
leaders of the cult in the mountains of China.

387
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:28,000
Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend 
that paled the speculations of theosophists and  

388
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:37,600
made man and the world seem recent and transient 
indeed. There had been aeons when other Things  

389
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:44,800
ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities. 
Remains of Them, he said the deathless Chinamen  

390
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:53,520
had told him, were still be found as Cyclopean 
stones on islands in the Pacific. They all died  

391
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:00,880
vast epochs of time before men came, but 
there were arts which could revive Them  

392
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,000
when the stars had come round again to the 
right positions in the cycle of eternity.  

393
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,120
They had, indeed, come themselves from the 
stars, and brought Their images with Them.

394
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:20,880
These Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were 
not composed altogether of flesh and blood. They  

395
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,280
had shape - for did not this star-fashioned image 
prove it? - but that shape was not made of matter.  

396
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,480
When the stars were right, They could plunge from 
world to world through the sky; but when the stars  

397
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:44,000
were wrong, They could not live. But although They 
no longer lived, They would never really die. They  

398
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:53,520
all lay in stone houses in Their great city of 
R’lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu  

399
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,120
for a glorious surrection when the stars and 
the earth might once more be ready for Them.  

400
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,520
But at that time some force from outside 
must serve to liberate Their bodies.  

401
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,320
The spells that preserved them intact likewise 
prevented Them from making an initial move,  

402
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:19,680
and They could only lie awake in the dark 
and think whilst uncounted millions of years  

403
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,040
rolled by. They knew all that 
was occurring in the universe,  

404
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:32,640
for Their mode of speech was transmitted thought. 
Even now They talked in Their tombs. When,  

405
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:39,200
after infinities of chaos, the first men came, 
the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among  

406
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,680
them by moulding their dreams; for only thus could 
Their language reach the fleshly minds of mammals.

407
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:52,320
Then, whispered Castro, those first men 
formed the cult around tall idols which  

408
00:44:52,320 --> 00:45:00,240
the Great Ones shewed them; idols brought in dim 
eras from dark stars. That cult would never die  

409
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,640
till the stars came right again, and the secret 
priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb  

410
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:16,160
to revive His subjects and resume His rule 
of earth. The time would be easy to know,  

411
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:23,920
for then mankind would have become as the Great 
Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil,  

412
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:31,840
with laws and morals thrown aside and all men 
shouting and killing and revelling in joy.  

413
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:40,000
Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them 
new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy  

414
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,840
themselves, and all the earth would flame 
with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom.  

415
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,440
Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites,  

416
00:45:51,440 --> 00:46:00,240
must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways 
and shadow forth the prophecy of their return.

417
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,280
In the elder time chosen men had talked 
with the entombed Old Ones in dreams,  

418
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:12,640
but then something happened. The great 
stone city R’lyeh, with its monoliths  

419
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:19,440
and sepulchres, had sunk beneath the waves; 
and the deep waters, full of the one primal  

420
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,280
mystery through which not even thought can 
pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse.  

421
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:32,080
But memory never died, and the high-priests 
said that the city would rise again when  

422
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:36,880
the stars were right. Then came out of 
the earth the black spirits of earth,  

423
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:44,080
mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours picked 
up in caverns beneath forgotten sea-bottoms.  

424
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,960
But of them old Castro dared not speak 
much. He cut himself off hurriedly,  

425
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,840
and no amount of persuasion or subtlety 
could elicit more in this direction.  

426
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,320
The size of the Old Ones, too, he 
curiously declined to mention. Of the cult,  

427
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:08,160
he said that he thought the centre lay amid 
the pathless desert of Arabia, where Irem,  

428
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:15,280
the City of Pillars, dreams hidden and untouched. 
It was not allied to the European witch-cult,  

429
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,640
and was virtually unknown beyond its members. 
No book had ever really hinted of it, though  

430
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,400
the deathless Chinamen said that there were double 
meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul  

431
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,560
Alhazred which the initiated might read as they 
chose, especially the much-discussed couplet:

432
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,840
That is not dead which can eternal lie,

433
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,160
And with strange aeons even death may die.

434
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,640
Legrasse, deeply impressed and not a little 
bewildered, had inquired in vain concerning  

435
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,000
the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro, 
apparently, had told the truth when he said that  

436
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,760
it was wholly secret. The authorities at Tulane 
University could shed no light upon either cult  

437
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,640
or image, and now the detective had come 
to the highest authorities in the country  

438
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,560
and met with no more than the 
Greenland tale of Professor Webb.

439
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,040
The feverish interest aroused at the meeting by 
Legrasse’s tale, corroborated as it was by the  

440
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,520
statuette, is echoed in the subsequent 
correspondence of those who attended;  

441
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,440
although scant mention occurs in the 
formal publications of the society.  

442
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,400
Caution is the first care of those accustomed 
to face occasional charlatanry and imposture.  

443
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,320
Legrasse for some time lent the image to 
Professor Webb, but at the latter’s death  

444
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,320
it was returned to him and remains in his 
possession, where I viewed it not long ago.  

445
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:48,160
It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably 
akin to the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.

446
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,120
That my uncle was excited by the tale of the 
sculptor I did not wonder, for what thoughts  

447
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:57,280
must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge 
of what Legrasse had learned of the cult,  

448
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,560
of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not 
only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the  

449
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:08,720
swamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, 
but had come in his dreams upon at least three  

450
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:14,560
of the precise words of the formula uttered alike 
by Esquimaux diabolists and mongrel Louisianans?.  

451
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,000
Professor Angell’s instant start on an 
investigation of the utmost thoroughness was  

452
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,440
eminently natural; though privately I suspected 
young Wilcox of having heard of the cult in some  

453
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,280
indirect way, and of having invented a series 
of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery  

454
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:37,840
at my uncle’s expense. The dream-narratives 
and cuttings collected by the professor were,  

455
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:42,720
of course, strong corroboration; but the 
rationalism of my mind and the extravagance  

456
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:49,440
of the whole subject led me to adopt what I 
thought the most sensible conclusions. So,  

457
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,120
after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and 
correlating the theosophical and anthropological  

458
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:01,040
notes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I 
made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor  

459
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:07,360
and give him the rebuke I thought proper for 
so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man.

460
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,640
Wilcox still lived alone in the 
Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas Street,  

461
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,160
a hideous Victorian imitation of seventeenth 
century Breton Architecture which flaunts its  

462
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,760
stuccoed front amidst the lovely colonial houses 
on the ancient hill, and under the very shadow  

463
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:30,400
of the finest Georgian steeple in America, I 
found him at work in his rooms, and at once  

464
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:37,360
conceded from the specimens scattered about that 
his genius is indeed profound and authentic. He  

465
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:43,760
will, I believe, some time be heard from as one 
of the great decadents; for he has crystallised  

466
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,680
in clay and will one day mirror in marble those 
nightmares and phantasies which Arthur Machen  

467
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:55,360
evokes in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith 
makes visible in verse and in painting.

468
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,480
Dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect,  

469
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,040
he turned languidly at my knock and 
asked me my business without rising.  

470
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,520
Then I told him who I was, he displayed 
some interest; for my uncle had excited  

471
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:17,280
his curiosity in probing his strange dreams, yet 
had never explained the reason for the study.  

472
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:25,040
I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, 
but sought with some subtlety to draw him out.  

473
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:33,280
In a short time I became convinced ofhis absolute 
sincerity, for he spoke of the dreams in a manner  

474
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:40,640
none could mistake. They and their subconscious 
residuum had influenced his art profoundly,  

475
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,880
and he shewed me a morbid statue whose contours 
almost made me shake with the potency of its black  

476
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:54,000
suggestion. He could not recall having seen the 
original of this thing except in his own dream  

477
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:02,400
bas-relief, but the outlines had formed themselves 
insensibly under his hands. It was, no doubt,  

478
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:09,440
the giant shape he had raved of in delirium. 
That he really knew nothing of the hidden cult,  

479
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:16,320
save from what my uncle’s relentless catechism 
had let fall, he soon made clear; and again I  

480
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:21,600
strove to think of some way in which he could 
possibly have received the weird impressions.

481
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:28,880
He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic 
fashion; making me see with terrible vividness  

482
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:35,440
the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone 
- whose geometry, he oddly said, was all  

483
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:42,560
wrong - and hear with frightened expectancy the 
ceaseless, half-mental calling from underground:  

484
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:51,920
“Cthulhu fhtagn”, “Cthulhu fhtagn.”

485
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:58,240
These words had formed part of that dread 
ritual which told of dead Cthulhu’s dream-vigil  

486
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:04,720
in his stone vault at R’lyeh, and I felt 
deeply moved despite my rational beliefs.  

487
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,840
Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of the cult in 
some casual way, and had soon forgotten it  

488
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,280
amidst the mass of his equally 
weird reading and imagining.  

489
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:22,080
Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, 
it had found subconscious expression in dreams,  

490
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:28,240
in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I 
now beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle  

491
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:35,600
had been a very innocent one. The youth was of 
a type, at once slightly affected and slightly  

492
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:41,360
ill-mannered, which I could never like, but I 
was willing enough now to admit both his genius  

493
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:48,640
and his honesty. I took leave of him amicably, 
and wish him all the success his talent promises.

494
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,880
The matter of the cult still remained to fascinate 
me, and at times I had visions of personal fame  

495
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:03,120
from researches into its origin and connexions. 
I visited New Orleans, talked with Legrasse and  

496
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:09,440
others of that old-time raiding-party, saw the 
frightful image, and even questioned such of the  

497
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:16,000
mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Castro, 
unfortunately, had been dead for some years.  

498
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:23,040
What I now heard so graphically at first-hand, 
though it was really no more than a detailed  

499
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:28,880
confirmation of what my uncle had written, 
excited me afresh; for I felt sure that I was  

500
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:36,000
on the track of a very real, very secret, and very 
ancient religion whose discovery would make me an  

501
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:44,240
anthropologist of note. My attitude was still one 
of absolute materialism, as I wish it still were,  

502
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,800
and I discounted with almost 
inexplicable perversity  

503
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:54,560
the coincidence of the dream notes and odd 
cuttings collected by Professor Angell.

504
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,240
One thing I began to suspect, 
and which I now fear I know,  

505
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:09,200
is that my uncle’s death was far from natural. He 
fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an  

506
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:16,400
ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels, 
after a careless push from a Negro sailor.  

507
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:22,480
I did not forget the mixed blood and marine 
pursuits of the cult-members in Louisiana, and  

508
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,880
would not be surprised to learn of secret methods 
and rites and beliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is  

509
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:36,960
true, have been let alone; but in Norway a certain 
seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the  

510
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:43,040
deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering 
the sculptor’s data have come to sinister ears?.  

511
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,640
I think Professor Angell died because he knew too 
much, or because he was likely to learn too much.  

512
00:55:51,440 --> 00:56:01,840
Whether I shall go as he did remains to 
be seen, for I have learned much now.

513
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:21,040
III. The Madness from the Sea 

514
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:29,120
If heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it 
will be a total effacing of the results of a  

515
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:36,400
mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray 
piece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on which I  

516
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,200
would naturally have stumbled in the course of 
my daily round, for it was an old number of an  

517
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:49,440
Australian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for April 
18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting bureau  

518
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,400
which had at the time of its issuance been avidly 
collecting material for my uncle’s research.

519
00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:00,720
I had largely given over my inquiries into what 
Professor Angell called the “Cthulhu Cult”,  

520
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,240
and was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, 
New Jersey; the curator of a local museum and  

521
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:12,240
a mineralogist of note. Examining one day the 
reserve specimens roughly set on the storage  

522
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:18,560
shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was 
caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers  

523
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:23,840
spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney 
Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend had  

524
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:30,560
wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign 
parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut of  

525
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:36,480
a hideous stone image almost identical with 
that which Legrasse had found in the swamp.

526
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,560
Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious 
contents, I scanned the item in detail;  

527
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,840
and was disappointed to find 
it of only moderate length.  

528
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,720
What it suggested, however, was of 
portentous significance to my flagging quest;  

529
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,360
and I carefully tore it out for 
immediate action. It read as follows:

530
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,160
MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA

531
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,800
Vigilant Arrives With Helpless 
Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow.  

532
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:08,640
One Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of 
Desperate Battle and Deaths at Sea. Rescued Seaman  

533
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:14,720
Refuses Particulars of Strange Experience. Odd 
Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry to Follow.

534
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,160
The Morrison Co.‘s freighter 
Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso,  

535
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:25,280
arrived this morning at its wharf in Darling 
Harbour, having in tow the battled and  

536
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:31,920
disabled but heavily armed steam yacht Alert 
of Dunedin, N.Z., which was sighted April 12th  

537
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:40,240
in S. Latitude 34 21’, W. Longitude 152 17’, 
with one living and one dead man aboard.

538
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,760
The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on 
April 2nd was driven considerably south of her  

539
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:54,160
course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster 
waves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted;  

540
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:59,280
and though apparently deserted, was found 
upon boarding to contain one survivor in a  

541
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,840
half-delirious condition and one man who had 
evidently been dead for more than a week.  

542
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,960
The living man was clutching a horrible stone 
idol of unknown origin, about foot in height,  

543
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,200
regarding whose nature authorities at 
Sydney University, the Royal Society,  

544
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,080
and the Museum in College Street all profess 
complete bafflement, and which the survivor  

545
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:25,280
says he found in the cabin of the yacht, 
in a small carved shrine of common pattern.

546
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:33,520
This man, after recovering his senses, told an 
exceedingly strange story of piracy and slaughter.  

547
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:39,440
He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some 
intelligence, and had been second mate of  

548
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:45,280
the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which 
sailed for Callao February 20th with a complement  

549
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:51,840
of eleven men. The Emma, he says, was delayed 
and thrown widely south of her course by the  

550
00:59:51,840 --> 01:00:00,720
great storm of March 1st, and on March 22nd, 
in S. Latitude 49 51’ W. Longitude 128 34’,  

551
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:06,560
encountered the Alert, manned by a queer and 
evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes.  

552
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:14,080
Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. 
Collins refused; whereupon the strange crew began  

553
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:20,320
to fire savagely and without warning upon the 
schooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass  

554
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:25,840
cannon forming part of the yacht’s equipment. 
The Emma ‘s men shewed fight, says the survivor,  

555
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:30,240
and though the schooner began to sink from shots 
beneath the water-line they managed to heave  

556
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,440
alongside their enemy and board her, grappling 
with the savage crew on the yacht’s deck,  

557
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,040
and being forced to kill them all, 
the number being slightly superior,  

558
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:43,840
because of their particularly abhorrent and 
desperate though rather clumsy mode of fighting.

559
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:50,160
Three of the Emma’s men, including Capt. 
Collins and First Mate Green, were killed;  

560
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,480
and the remaining eight under Second Mate 
Johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht,  

561
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,360
going ahead in their original direction to see if 
any reason for their ordering back had existed.  

562
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:07,360
The next day, it appears, they raised and landed 
on a small island, although none is known to exist  

563
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:14,480
in that part of the ocean; and six of the men 
somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly  

564
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:22,800
reticent about this part of his story, and speaks 
only of their falling into a rock chasm. Later,  

565
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:27,840
it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht 
and tried to manage her, but were beaten about  

566
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:34,240
by the storm of April 2nd, From that time till 
his rescue on the 12th the man remembers little,  

567
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,320
and he does not even recall when 
William Briden, his companion, died.  

568
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,800
Briden’s death reveals no apparent cause, and 
was probably due to excitement or exposure.  

569
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:51,440
Cable advices from Dunedin report that the 
Alert was well known there as an island trader,  

570
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:57,920
and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront, 
It was owned by a curious group of half-castes  

571
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,880
whose frequent meetings and night trips to 
the woods attracted no little curiosity;  

572
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,520
and it had set sail in great haste just after 
the storm and earth tremors of March 1st.  

573
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:14,560
Our Auckland correspondent gives the Emma 
and her crew an excellent reputation,  

574
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,600
and Johansen is described 
as a sober and worthy man.  

575
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:23,680
The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the 
whole matter beginning tomorrow, at which every  

576
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,400
effort will be made to induce Johansen to 
speak more freely than he has done hitherto.

577
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,200
This was all, together with the 
picture of the hellish image; but  

578
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:39,920
what a train of ideas it started in my mind! Here 
were new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu Cult,  

579
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,840
and evidence that it had strange 
interests at sea as well as on land.  

580
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,200
What motive prompted the hybrid crew to order 
back the Emma as they sailed about with their  

581
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,240
hideous idol? What was the unknown island 
on which six of the Emma ‘s crew had died,  

582
01:02:54,800 --> 01:03:00,080
and about which the mate Johansen was so 
secretive? What had the vice-admiralty’s  

583
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:06,000
investigation brought out, and what was known of 
the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvellous  

584
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,320
of all, what deep and more than natural linkage 
of dates was this which gave a malign and now  

585
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:17,680
undeniable significance to the various turns 
of events so carefully noted by my uncle?

586
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,960
March 1st - or February 28th according to the 
International Date Line - the earthquake and storm  

587
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:31,280
had come. From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome 
crew had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously  

588
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,240
summoned, and on the other side of the earth 
poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange,  

589
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:42,080
dank Cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had 
moulded in his sleep the form of the dreaded  

590
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:48,640
Cthulhu. March 23rd the crew of the Emma landed 
on an unknown island and left six men dead; and  

591
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:54,640
on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed 
a heightened vividness and darkened with dread  

592
01:03:54,640 --> 01:04:00,480
of a giant monster’s malign pursuit, whilst an 
architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed  

593
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:06,720
suddenly into delirium! And what of this storm of 
April 2nd - the date on which all dreams of the  

594
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:14,000
dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged unharmed from 
the bondage of strange fever? What of all this -  

595
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:20,720
and of those hints of old Castro about the sunken, 
star-born Old Ones and their coming reign; their  

596
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:26,400
faithful cult and their mastery of dreams? Was I 
tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond  

597
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:32,880
man’s power to bear? If so, they must be horrors 
of the mind alone, for in some way the second  

598
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:39,840
of April had put a stop to whatever monstrous 
menace had begun its siege of mankind’s soul.

599
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:46,640
That evening, after a day of hurried cabling and 
arranging, I bade my host adieu and took a train  

600
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:52,480
for San Francisco. In less than a month I was 
in Dunedin; where, however, I found that little  

601
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:58,240
was known of the strange cult-members who had 
lingered in the old sea-taverns. Waterfront scum  

602
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:04,080
was far too common for special mention; though 
there was vague talk about one inland trip these  

603
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:09,440
mongrels had made, during which faint drumming 
and red flame were noted on the distant hills.  

604
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,560
In Auckland I learned that Johansen 
had returned with yellow hair  

605
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:19,600
turned white after a perfunctory and 
inconclusive questioning at Sydney,  

606
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:26,080
and had thereafter sold his cottage in West Street 
and sailed with his wife to his old home in Oslo.  

607
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,200
Of his stirring experience he would 
tell his friends no more than he had  

608
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:36,480
told the admiralty officials, and all they 
could do was to give me his Oslo address.

609
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,760
After that I went to Sydney and talked 
profitlessly with seamen and members  

610
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,480
of the vice-admiralty court. I saw the 
Alert, now sold and in commercial use,  

611
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,960
at Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, but 
gained nothing from its non-committal bulk.  

612
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,360
The crouching image with its cuttlefish head, 
dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed  

613
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:03,360
pedestal, was preserved in the Museum at Hyde 
Park; and I studied it long and well, finding  

614
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:10,320
it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship, and 
with the same utter mystery, terrible antiquity,  

615
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:17,120
and unearthly strangeness of material which I had 
noted in Legrasse’s smaller specimen. Geologists,  

616
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:23,200
the curator told me, had found it a monstrous 
puzzle; for they vowed that the world held no rock  

617
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,960
like it. Then I thought with a shudder of what 
Old Castro had told Legrasse about the Old Ones;  

618
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:34,160
“They had come from the stars, and 
had brought Their images with Them.”

619
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,800
Shaken with such a mental revolution as I had 
never before known, I now resolved to visit Mate  

620
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:47,520
Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I reembarked 
at once for the Norwegian capital; and one autumn  

621
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:54,080
day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of 
the Egeberg. Johansen’s address, I discovered,  

622
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:59,920
lay in the Old Town of King Harold Haardrada, 
which kept alive the name of Oslo during all the  

623
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:06,560
centuries that the greater city masqueraded as 
“Christiana.” I made the brief trip by taxicab,  

624
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:11,520
and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of 
a neat and ancient building with plastered front.  

625
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:16,720
A sad-faced woman in black answered 
my summons, and I was stung with  

626
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:22,160
disappointment when she told me in halting 
English that Gustaf Johansen was no more.

627
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,920
He had not long survived 
his return, said his wife,  

628
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:33,040
for the doings sea in 1925 had broken him. He 
had told her no more than he told the public,  

629
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:38,880
but had left a long manuscript - of “technical 
matters” as he said - written in English,  

630
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,480
evidently in order to guard her 
from the peril of casual perusal.  

631
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,400
During a walk through a narrow lane near the 
Gothenburg dock, a bundle of papers falling  

632
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:56,400
from an attic window had knocked him down. Two 
Lascar sailors at once helped him to his feet, but  

633
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:05,920
before the ambulance could reach him he was 
dead. Physicians found no adequate cause the end,  

634
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:13,200
and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened 
constitution. I now felt gnawing at my vitals that  

635
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:19,760
dark terror which will never leave me till I, 
too, am at rest; “accidentally” or otherwise.  

636
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:26,000
Persuading the widow that my connexion with her 
husband’s “technical matters” was sufficient to  

637
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,120
entitle me to his manuscript, I bore the document 
away and began to read it on the London boat.

638
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:40,000
It was a simple, rambling thing - a naive sailor’s 
effort at a post-facto diary - and strove to  

639
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:47,360
recall day by day that last awful voyage. I 
cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim in  

640
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:54,160
all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell 
its gist enough to shew why the sound the water  

641
01:08:54,160 --> 01:09:00,240
against the vessel’s sides became so unendurable 
to me that I stopped my ears with cotton.

642
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:07,680
Johansen, thank God, did not know quite all, 
even though he saw the city and the Thing,  

643
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:13,520
but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think 
of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life  

644
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:19,520
in time and in space, and of those unhallowed 
blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath  

645
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,800
the sea, known and favoured by a nightmare cult 
ready and eager to loose them upon the world  

646
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:30,160
whenever another earthquake shall heave their 
monstrous stone city again to the sun and air.

647
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,400
Johansen’s voyage had begun just as 
he told it to the vice-admiralty.  

648
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:42,560
The Emma, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on 
February 20th, and had felt the full force of  

649
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:48,080
that earthquake-born tempest which must have 
heaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that  

650
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:54,320
filled men’s dreams. Once more under control, 
the ship was making good progress when held  

651
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,320
up by the Alert on March 22nd, 
and I could feel the mate’s regret  

652
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:04,400
as he wrote of her bombardment and 
sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends  

653
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:10,240
on the Alert he speaks with significant horror. 
There was some peculiarly abominable quality about  

654
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:16,160
them which made their destruction seem almost a 
duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the  

655
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:21,120
charge of ruthlessness brought against his party 
during the proceedings of the court of inquiry.  

656
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:27,680
Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured 
yacht under Johansen’s command, the men sight  

657
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:36,800
a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea, 
and in S. Latitude 47 9’, W. Longitude l23 43’,  

658
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:44,240
come upon a coastline of mingled mud, ooze, and 
weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less  

659
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:50,480
than the tangible substance of earth’s supreme 
terror - the nightmare corpse-city of R’lyeh,  

660
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:55,680
that was built in measureless aeons behind 
history by the vast, loathsome shapes that  

661
01:10:55,680 --> 01:11:02,160
seeped down from the dark stars. There lay 
great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green  

662
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:09,040
slimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles 
incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the  

663
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:14,160
dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously 
to the faithfull to come on a pilgrimage of  

664
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:20,400
liberation and restoration. All this Johansen did 
not suspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!

665
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,000
I suppose that only a single mountain-top, 
the hideous monolith-crowned citadel  

666
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
whereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually 
emerged from the waters. When I think of  

667
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,440
the extent of all that may be brooding down 
there I almost wish to kill myself forthwith.  

668
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:44,720
Johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic 
majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder daemons,  

669
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:50,720
and must have guessed without guidance that it was 
nothing of this or of any sane planet. Awe at the  

670
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:56,720
unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks, at 
the dizzying height of the great carven monolith,  

671
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:02,560
and at the stupefying identity of the colossal 
statues and bas-reliefs with the queer image found  

672
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:08,240
in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible 
in every line of the mates frightened description.

673
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:14,080
Without knowing what futurism is like, 
Johansen achieved something very close  

674
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:19,120
to it when he spoke of the city; for instead of 
describing any definite structure or building,  

675
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:25,920
he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles 
and stone surfaces - surfaces too great to belong  

676
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:31,200
to anything right or proper for this earth, and 
impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs.  

677
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:37,040
I mention his talk about angles because it 
suggests something Wilcox had told me of his  

678
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:43,840
awful dreams. He said that the geometry 
of the dream-place he saw was abnormal,  

679
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:50,080
non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent 
of spheres and dimensions apart from ours.  

680
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:55,040
Now an unlettered seaman felt the same 
thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality.

681
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,320
Johansen and his men landed at a sloping 
mud-bank on this monstrous Acropolis,  

682
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:06,960
and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks 
which could have been no mortal staircase. The  

683
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:12,640
very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed 
through the polarising miasma welling out from  

684
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:20,080
this sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and 
suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive  

685
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:26,400
angles of carven rock where a second glance 
shewed concavity after the first shewed convexity.

686
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,320
Something very like fright had come over all the  

687
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,880
explorers before anything more definite 
than rock and ooze and weed was seen.  

688
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:41,760
Each would have fled had he not feared the scorn 
of the others, and it was only half-heartedly  

689
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:47,600
that they searched - vainly, as it proved 
- for some portable souvenir to bear away.

690
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:54,320
It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed 
up the foot of the monolith and shouted of  

691
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,600
what he had found. The rest followed him, and 
looked curiously at the immense carved door  

692
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:07,440
with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. 
It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door;  

693
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:13,360
and they all felt that it was a door because of 
the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around it,  

694
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:18,240
though they could not decide whether it lay 
flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an  

695
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:24,480
outside cellar-door. As Wilcox would have 
said, the geometry of the place was all wrong.  

696
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,480
One could not be sure that the sea 
and the ground were horizontal,  

697
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,200
hence the relative position of everything 
else seemed phantasmally variable.

698
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,000
Briden pushed at the stone in 
several places without result.  

699
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,680
Then Donovan felt over it delicately around the 
edge, pressing each point separately as he went.  

700
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:49,120
He climbed interminably along the 
grotesque stone moulding - that is,  

701
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,600
one would call it climbing if the thing 
was not after all horizontal - and the men  

702
01:14:53,600 --> 01:15:01,520
wondered how any door in the universe could 
be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly,  

703
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:07,360
the acre-great lintel began to give inward at 
the top; and they saw that it was balanced.

704
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:14,480
Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down 
or along the jamb and rejoined his fellows,  

705
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:18,480
and everyone watched the queer recession 
of the monstrously carven portal.  

706
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:25,760
In this phantasy of prismatic distortion 
it moved anomalously in a diagonal way,  

707
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,040
so that all the rules of matter 
and perspective seemed upset.

708
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,160
The aperture was black with a darkness almost 
material. That tenebrousness was indeed a  

709
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:41,120
positive quality ; for it obscured such parts of 
the inner walls as ought to have been revealed,  

710
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:47,440
and actually burst forth like smoke from its 
aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun  

711
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:55,040
as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky 
on flapping membraneous wings. The odour rising  

712
01:15:55,040 --> 01:16:00,400
from the newly opened depths was intolerable, 
and at length the quick-eared Hawkins thought  

713
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:07,120
he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. 
Everyone listened, and everyone was listening  

714
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:14,480
still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and 
gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity  

715
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:20,480
through the black doorway into the tainted 
outside air of that poison city of madness.

716
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:26,960
Poor Johansen’s handwriting almost gave out 
when he wrote of this. Of the six men who never  

717
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:31,200
reached the ship, he thinks two perished 
of pure fright in that accursed instant.  

718
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:38,960
The Thing cannot be described - there is no 
language for such abysms of shrieking and  

719
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:46,160
immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions 
of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain  

720
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:53,120
walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across 
the earth a great architect went mad, and poor  

721
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:59,200
Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic 
instant? The Thing of the idols, the green,  

722
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:06,160
sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to 
claim his own. The stars were right again,  

723
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:11,920
and what an age-old cult had failed to do by 
design, a band of innocent sailors had done  

724
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:20,000
by accident. After vigintillions of years great 
Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.

725
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:26,000
Three men were swept up by the flabby 
claws before anybody turned. God rest them,  

726
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,800
if there be any rest in the universe. They were 
Donovan, Guerrera, and Angstrom. Parker slipped  

727
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,520
as the other three were plunging frenziedly over 
endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat,  

728
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,960
and Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an 
angle of masonry which shouldn’t have been there;  

729
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:48,320
an angle which was acute, but behaved as if 
it were obtuse. So only Briden and Johansen  

730
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:53,440
reached the boat, and pulled desperately for 
the Alert as the mountainous monstrosity flopped  

731
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:57,840
down the slimy stones and hesitated, 
floundering at the edge of the water.

732
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:05,120
Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely, 
despite the departure of all hands for the shore;  

733
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,600
and it was the work of only a few moments of 
feverish rushing up and down between wheel and  

734
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:17,040
engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly, amidst 
the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene,  

735
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:22,480
she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst 
on the masonry of that charnel shore that  

736
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:28,640
was not of earth the titan Thing from the 
stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme  

737
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:35,840
cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder 
than the storied Cyclops, great Cthulhu slid  

738
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:42,960
greasily into the water and began to pursue with 
vast wave-raising strokes of cosmic potency.  

739
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:49,280
Briden looked back and went mad, laughing 
shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals  

740
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:54,160
till death found him one night in the cabin 
whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.

741
01:18:54,720 --> 01:19:00,240
But Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that 
the Thing could surely overtake the Alert until  

742
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:06,160
steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate 
chance; and, setting the engine for full speed,  

743
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:12,720
ran lightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. 
There was a mighty eddying and foaming in the  

744
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:19,040
noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher and 
higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head  

745
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:25,760
on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the 
unclean froth like the stern of a daemon galleon.  

746
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:31,840
The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came 
nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht,  

747
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:39,600
but johansen drove on relentlessly. There was 
a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy  

748
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:46,720
nastiness as of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of 
a thousand opened graves, and a sound that the  

749
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:54,240
chronicler could not put on paper. For an instant 
the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding  

750
01:19:54,240 --> 01:20:00,320
green cloud, and then there was only a venomous 
seething astern; where - God in heaven! - the  

751
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:06,640
scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn 
was nebulously recombining in its hateful original  

752
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:12,960
form, whilst its distance widened every second as 
the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam.

753
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:20,320
That was all. After that Johansen only brooded 
over the idol in the cabin and attended to a  

754
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:25,600
few matters of food for himself and the 
laughing maniac by his side. He did not  

755
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,640
try to navigate after the first bold flight, for 
the reaction had taken something out of his soul.  

756
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,480
Then came the storm of April 2nd, and a 
gathering of the clouds about his consciousness.  

757
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:42,160
There is a sense of spectral whirling 
through liquid gulfs of infinity,  

758
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:48,640
of dizzying rides through reeling universes 
on a comets tail, and of hysterical plunges  

759
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:54,000
from the pit to the moon and from the moon back 
again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating  

760
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:00,720
chorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and 
the green, bat-winged mocking imps of Tartarus.

761
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:06,480
Out of that dream came rescue-the 
Vigilant, the vice-admiralty court,  

762
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:11,040
the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage 
back home to the old house by the Egeberg.  

763
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:18,560
He could not tell - they would think him mad. He 
would write of what he knew before death came,  

764
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:27,840
but his wife must not guess. Death would be a 
boon if only it could blot out the memories.

765
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:34,240
That was the document I read, and now I have 
placed it in the tin box beside the bas-relief and  

766
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:41,840
the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall go 
this record of mine - this test of my own sanity,  

767
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:48,320
wherein is pieced together that which I hope may 
never be pieced together again. I have looked upon  

768
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:54,080
all that the universe has to hold of horror, and 
even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer  

769
01:21:54,080 --> 01:22:02,480
must ever afterward be poison to me. But I do 
not think my life will be long. As my uncle went,  

770
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:11,680
as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I 
know too much, and the cult still lives.

771
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:20,240
Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in 
that chasm of stone which has shielded him since  

772
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:26,560
the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken 
once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the spot  

773
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:32,560
after the April storm; but his ministers 
on earth still bellow and prance and slay  

774
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:39,360
around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. 
He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst  

775
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:45,360
within his black abyss, or else the world would 
by now be screaming with fright and frenzy.  

776
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:52,960
Who knows the end? What has risen 
may sink, and what has sunk may rise.  

777
01:22:54,880 --> 01:23:00,800
Loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep, and 
decay spreads over the tottering cities of men.  

778
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:10,000
A time will come - but I must not and cannot 
think! Let me pray that, if I do not survive this  

779
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:19,840
manuscript, my executors may put caution before 
audacity and see that it meets no other eye.

780
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:28,844
-THE END-
