00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,310
CHAPTER ONE
The Landlady

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,720
Billy Weaver had travelled down from London
on the slow afternoon train, changing trains

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,679
on the way, and by the time he got to Bath
it was about nine o'clock in the evening.

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,050
The air was very cold and the wind was like
a flat blade of ice on his cheeks.

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:28,119
'Excuse me,' he said, 'but is there a fairly
cheap hotel not too far away from here?'

6
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:33,280
'Try the pub down the road,' a man at the
station said, pointing.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,300
'They might take you in.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,640
It's about a kilometer along on the other
side.'

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,150
Billy thanked him and picked up his suitcase
and set out to walk to the inn.

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,340
He had never been to Bath before.

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,610
He didn't know anyone who lived there, but
his boss at the Head Office in London had

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,940
told him it was a splendid city.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,760
'Find your own accommodation,' he had said,
'and then go along and report to the Local

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,280
Manager as soon as you've got yourself settled.'

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,359
Billy was seventeen years old.

16
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:11,600
He was wearing a new dark blue overcoat, a
new brown hat, a new brown suit, and he was

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,450
feeling fine.

18
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,299
He walked briskly down the street.

19
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,749
He was trying to do everything briskly these
days.

20
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:24,049
All successful businessmen, he had decided,
were brisk.

21
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:27,090
The top men at Head Office were brisk all
the time.

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,080
They were amazing.

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,619
There were no shops on this wide street, only
a line of tall houses on each side, all of

24
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:37,549
them looking the same.

25
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:43,109
They had grand entrances and four or five
steps going up to their front doors, and it

26
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:47,250
was obvious that they had been very grand
houses indeed.

27
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,389
But now, even in the darkness, he could see
that the paint was coming off the doors and

28
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:59,459
windows, and that the handsome white exteriors
had cracks and patches from lack of repair.

29
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:05,119
Suddenly, in a downstairs window that was
illuminated by a nearby street lamp, Billy

30
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,420
saw a printed notice leaning against the glass
in one of the windows.

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,360
It said BED AND BREAKFAST.

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,020
He stopped walking.

33
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,110
He moved a bit closer.

34
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,220
Green curtains were hanging down on each side
of the window.

35
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,170
He went right up to it and looked through
the glass into the room, and the first thing

36
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,630
he saw was a bright fire burning in the fireplace.

37
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,870
On the carpet in front of the fire, a pretty
little dog was curled up asleep.

38
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,850
The room itself, which he could only see in
half-darkness, was filled with pleasant furniture.

39
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:49,430
There was a piano and a big sofa and several
comfortable armchairs; and in one corner he

40
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,040
saw a large parrot in a cage.

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,260
Animals were usually a good sign in a place
like this, Billy told himself, and it looked

42
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,540
to him as if it would be a pretty decent house
to stay in.

43
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,890
Certainly it would be more comfortable than
a pub.

44
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,120
On the other hand, a pub would be more friendly
than a guesthouse.

45
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,080
There would be beer and cards in the evenings,
and lots of people to talk to, and it would

46
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,540
probably be a lot cheaper, too.

47
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,090
He had stayed a couple of nights in a pub
once before and had liked it.

48
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,620
He had never stayed in any guesthouses and,
to be perfectly honest, he was a tiny bit

49
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,160
frightened of them.

50
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,110
The word 'guesthouse' suggested watery vegetables
and greedy landladies.

51
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,570
After hesitating like this in the cold for
two or three minutes, Billy decided that he

52
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,490
would walk on and look at the pub before making
up his mind.

53
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,450
He turned to go.

54
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,660
And now a strange thing happened to him.

55
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,530
He was just going to step back and turn away
from the window when his eye was caught and

56
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,670
held in the most peculiar manner by the small
notice that was there.

57
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,290
BED AND BREAKFAST, it said.

58
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,930
BED AND BREAKFAST, BED AND BREAKFAST.

59
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,959
Each word was like a large black eye staring
at him through the glass, holding him, forcing

60
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,930
him to stay where he was and not to walk away
from that house, and the next thing he knew,

61
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,820
he was actually moving across from the window
to the front door, climbing the steps that

62
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,060
led to it and reaching for the bell.

63
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,970
He pressed it.

64
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,840
Far away in a back room he heard it ringing,
and then at once - it must have been at once

65
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,340
because he hadn't even had time to take his
finger from the bell-button - the door swung

66
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,320
open and a woman was standing there.

67
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,341
She was about forty-five or fifty years old,
and the moment she saw him, she gave him a

68
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:57,530
warm welcoming smile.

69
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,670
'Please come in,' she said pleasantly.

70
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,930
She stepped to one side, holding the door
wide open, and Billy found himself automatically

71
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,740
starting forward into the house: the force
or, more accurately, the desire to follow

72
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,900
her was extraordinarily strong.

73
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,680
'I saw the notice in the window,' he said,
holding himself back.

74
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,501
'Yes, I know.'

75
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:24,790
'I was wondering about a room.'

76
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,150
'It's all ready for you, my dear,' she said.

77
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,960
She had a round pink face and very gentle
blue eyes.

78
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,980
'I was on my way to a pub,' Billy told her.

79
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,880
'But I noticed the sign in your window.'

80
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:44,140
'My dear boy,' she said, 'why don't you come
in out of the cold?'

81
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,180
'How much do you charge?'

82
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,200
'Nine pounds a night, including breakfast.'

83
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,540
It was amazingly cheap.

84
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,330
It was less than half of what he had been
willing to pay.

85
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:02,139
'If that is too much,' she added, 'then perhaps
I can reduce it just a tiny bit.

86
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:04,870
Do you desire an egg for breakfast?

87
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,090
Eggs are expensive at the moment.

88
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,880
It would cost less without the egg.'

89
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,200
'Nine pounds is fine,' he answered.

90
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,830
'I would like very much to stay here.'

91
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,540
'I knew you would.

92
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,580
Do come in.'

93
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,560
She seemed terribly nice.

94
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,690
She looked exactly like the mother of one's
best school friend welcoming one into the

95
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,890
house to stay for the Christmas holidays.

96
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,750
Billy took off his hat and stepped inside.

97
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,930
'Just hang it there,' she said, 'and let me
help you with your coat.'

98
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,080
There were no other hats or coats in the hall.

99
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,930
There were no umbrellas, no walking-sticks
- nothing.

100
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:52,150
'We have it all to ourselves,' she said, smiling
at him over her shoulder as she led the way

101
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,150
upstairs.

102
00:06:53,150 --> 00:07:00,680
'You see, I don't very often have the pleasure
of taking a visitor into my little nest.'

103
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,639
The old girl is slightly mad, Billy told himself.

104
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,320
But at nine pounds a night, who cares about
that?

105
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,699
'I should've thought you'd be simply full
of visitors wanting to stay,' he said politely.

106
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,870
'Oh, I am, my dear, I am, of course I am.

107
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:25,750
But the trouble is that I am just a tiny bit
careful about whom I choose - if you see what

108
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,220
I mean.'

109
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,690
'Ah, yes.'

110
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,919
'But I'm always ready.

111
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:38,100
Everything is always ready day and night in
this house just in case an acceptable young

112
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,310
gentleman comes along.

113
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:46,810
And it is such a pleasure, my dear, when now
and again I open the door and I see someone

114
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,640
standing there who is just exactly right.'

115
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,560
She was halfway up the stairs, and she paused,
turned her head and smiled down at him.

116
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,020
'Like you,' she added, and her blue eyes travelled
slowly all the way down the length of Billy's

117
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,550
body, to his feet, and then up again.

118
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,540
On the first floor she said to him, 'This
floor is mine.'

119
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,520
They climbed up more stairs.

120
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,210
'And this one is all yours,' she said.

121
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,520
'Here's your room.

122
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,050
I do hope you'll like it.'

123
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,330
She took him into a small but charming front
bedroom, switching on the light as she went

124
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,330
in.

125
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:33,550
'The morning sun comes right in the window,
Mr Perkins.

126
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,450
It is Mr Perkins, isn't it?'

127
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,149
'No,' he said.

128
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:41,089
'It's Weaver.'

129
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,039
'Mr Weaver.

130
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,410
How nice.

131
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,680
I've put a hot water bottle between the sheets
to warm them, Mr Weaver.

132
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,110
And you may light the gas fire at any time
if you feel cold.'

133
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,140
'Thank you,' Billy said.

134
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,950
'Thank you very much.'

135
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,860
He noticed that the bedclothes had been neatly
turned back on one side, all ready for someone

136
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,860
to get in.

137
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:12,490
'I'm so glad you appeared,' she said, looking
seriously into his face.

138
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,050
'I was beginning to get worried.'

139
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,040
'That's all right,' Billy answered brightly.

140
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,490
'You mustn't worry about me.'

141
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,140
He put his suitcase on the chair and started
to open it.

142
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,490
'And what about supper, my dear?

143
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,820
Did you manage to get anything to eat before
you came here?'

144
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,580
'I'm not hungry, thank you,' he said.

145
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,510
'I think I'll just go to bed as soon as possible
because tomorrow I've got to get up rather

146
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,810
early and report to the office.'

147
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,480
'Very well, then.

148
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,580
I'll leave you now so that you can unpack.

149
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,830
But before you go to bed, would you be kind
enough to come into the sitting room on the

150
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,200
ground floor and sign the book?

151
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,930
Everyone has to do that because it's the law,
and we don't want to break any laws at this

152
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,710
stage in the proceedings, do we?'

153
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,560
She gave him a little wave of the hand and
went quickly out of the room and closed the

154
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,140
door.

155
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:19,320
The fact that his landlady appeared to be
slightly crazy didn't worry Billy at all.

156
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,850
She was not only harmless - there was no question
about that - but she was also quite obviously

157
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,310
a kind and generous person.

158
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,500
He guessed that she had probably lost a son
of her own or something like that, and had

159
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,260
never recovered from it.

160
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,310
So a few minutes later, after unpacking and
washing his hands, he walked downstairs to

161
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,510
the ground floor and entered the sitting room.

162
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:48,200
His landlady wasn't there, but the fire was
still burning and the little dog was still

163
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,480
sleeping in front of it.

164
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,260
The room was wonderfully warm and comfortable.

165
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,930
I'm a lucky fellow, he thought, rubbing his
hands.

166
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,290
This is great.

167
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,140
He found the guest-book lying open on the
piano, so he took out his pen and wrote down

168
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,460
his name and address.

169
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:13,610
There were only two other names above his
on the page and, as one always does, he started

170
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,270
to read them.

171
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,399
One was a Christopher MulhoUand from Cardiff.

172
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,149
The other was Gregory W. Temple from Bristol.

173
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,030
That's funny, he thought suddenly.

174
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,290
Christopher Mulholland.

175
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,750
That name sounds familiar.

176
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,020
Now where had he heard that rather unusual
name before?

177
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,790
Was he a boy at school?

178
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,790
No.

179
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:43,650
Was it one of his sister's numerous young
men, perhaps, or a friend of his father's?

180
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,100
No, no, it wasn't any of those.

181
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,620
He glanced down again at the book.

182
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,600
In fact, thinking about it again, he wasn't
at all sure that the second name wasn't as

183
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,080
familiar to him as the first.

184
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,410
'Gregory Temple?' he said aloud, searching
his memory.

185
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,890
'Christopher Mulholland...?'

186
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:12,720
'Such charming boys,' a voice behind him answered,
and he turned and saw his landlady walking

187
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,810
into the room carrying the tea tray in front
of her.

188
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,100
'They sound somehow familiar,' he said.

189
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,890
'They do?

190
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,519
How interesting.'

191
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,089
'I'm almost positive I've heard those names
before somewhere.

192
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:30,680
Isn't that strange?

193
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,510
Maybe it was in the newspapers.

194
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,020
They weren't famous in any way, were they?

195
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,610
I mean, famous footballers or something like
that?'

196
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,230
'Famous,' she said, setting the tray down
on the low table in front of the sofa.

197
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,080
'Oh no, I don't think they were famous.

198
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,050
But they were extraordinarily handsome, both
of them, I can promise you that.

199
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:02,760
They were tall and young and handsome, my
dear, just exactly like you.'

200
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,660
Once more, Billy glanced down at the book.

201
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,890
'Look here,' he said, noticing the dates.

202
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,540
'This last entry is over two years old.'

203
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,320
'Is it?'

204
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,110
'Yes, indeed.

205
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:22,640
And Christopher Mulholland's is nearly a year
before that - more than three years ago.'

206
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,760
'Oh dear,' she said, shaking her head.

207
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,900
'I never would have thought it.

208
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,420
How time flies away from us all, doesn't it,
Mr Wilkins?'

209
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,260
'It's Weaver,' Billy said.

210
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,260
'W-E-A-V-E-R.'

211
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,290
'Oh, of course it is!'

212
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,120
she cried, sitting down on the sofa.

213
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,510
'How silly of me.

214
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,800
I do apologize.'

215
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,649
'Do you know something that's extraordinary
about all this?

216
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:59,930
Both those names, Mulholland and Temple, I
not only seem to remember each one separately

217
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,110
but they appear to be connected as well.

218
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:09,290
As if they were both famous for the same sort
of thing, if you see what I mean.'

219
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:14,860
'Well, come over here now, dear, and sit down
beside me on the sofa and I'll give you a

220
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,850
nice cup of tea and a biscuit before you go
to bed.'

221
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,740
Billy watched her as she busied herself with
the cups and saucers.

222
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:32,260
He noticed that she had small, white, quickly
moving hands, and red fingernails.

223
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,620
'I'm almost positive I saw them in the newspapers,'
Billy said.

224
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,520
'I'll think of them in a second.

225
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,070
I'm sure I will.'

226
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:46,089
There is nothing more annoying than a thing
like this which remains just outside one's

227
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:47,089
memory.

228
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:48,970
He hated to give up.

229
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,790
'Now wait a minute,' he said.

230
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,630
'Wait just a minute.

231
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,680
Mulholland...

232
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,310
Christopher Mulholland... wasn't that the
name of the schoolboy who was on a walking

233
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,740
tour through the West Country, and then suddenly...'

234
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,740
'Milk?'

235
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,740
she said.

236
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,010
'And sugar?'

237
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,440
'Yes, please.

238
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,040
And then suddenly...?'

239
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
'Schoolboy?'

240
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
she said.

241
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,470
'Oh no, my dear, that can't possibly be right
because my Mr Mulholland was certainly not

242
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,680
a schoolboy when he came to me.

243
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,700
He was a university student.

244
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:37,100
Come over here now and sit next to me and
warm yourself in front of this lovely fire.

245
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,540
Come on.

246
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,089
Your tea's all ready for you.'

247
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:47,450
He crossed the room slowly, and sat down on
the edge of the sofa.

248
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,350
She placed his teacup on the table in front
of him.

249
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,240
'There we are,' she said.

250
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,930
'How nice and comfortable this is, isn't it?'

251
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,130
Billy started drinking his tea.

252
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,130
She did the same.

253
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:08,750
For half a minute, neither of them spoke but
Billy knew that she was looking at him.

254
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:14,200
Her body was half-turned towards him and he
could feel her eyes resting on his face, watching

255
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,360
him from over her teacup.

256
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,060
Now and again he caught a peculiar smell that
seemed to come from her direction.

257
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,980
It wasn't unpleasant, and it reminded him
- well, he wasn't quite sure what it was.

258
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,810
New leather?

259
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,110
Or was it the corridors of a hospital?

260
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:39,260
'Mr Mulholland loved his tea,' she finally
said.

261
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:46,070
'I've never seen anyone in my life drink as
much tea as dear, sweet Mr Mulholland.'

262
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,480
'I suppose he left fairly recently,' Billy
said.

263
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
'Left?'

264
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
she said.

265
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,120
'But my dear boy, he never left.

266
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,709
He's still here.

267
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:59,089
Mr Temple is also here.

268
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,880
They're on the third floor, both of them together.'

269
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,400
Billy put down his cup slowly on the table,
and stared at his landlady.

270
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,929
She smiled back at him and then put out one
of her white hands and patted him comfortingly

271
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:15,929
on the knee.

272
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,170
'How old are you, my dear?'

273
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,750
she asked.

274
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,189
'Seventeen.'

275
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:23,639
'Seventeen!'

276
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:24,639
she cried.

277
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:27,250
'Oh, it's the perfect age!

278
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,030
Mr Mulholland was also seventeen.

279
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:36,620
But I think he was a little shorter than you
are - in fact I'm sure he was.

280
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,510
And his teeth weren't quite so white.

281
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,760
You have the most beautiful teeth, Mr Weaver.

282
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,980
Mr Temple was a little older.

283
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,299
He was actually twenty-eight.

284
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:52,300
I wouldn't have guessed it, though, if he
hadn't told me.

285
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,040
There wasn't a mark on his body.'

286
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,880
'A what?'

287
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
Billy said.

288
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,400
'His skin was just like a baby's.'

289
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,270
There was a pause.

290
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:11,570
Billy picked up his teacup, drank some more
and then put it down again in its saucer.

291
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,800
He waited for her to say something else but
she seemed to have fallen into another of

292
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,710
her silences.

293
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,630
He sat there, looking ahead, biting his lower
lip.

294
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,280
'That parrot,' he said at last.

295
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,890
'You know something?

296
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,590
It completely fooled me when I looked through
the window from the street.

297
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,890
I thought it was alive.'

298
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,500
'Sadly, no longer.'

299
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,850
'It's very clever the way it's been stuffed,'
he said.

300
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,860
'It doesn't look at all dead.

301
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,840
Who did it?'

302
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,160
'I did.'

303
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,480
'You did?'

304
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,720
'Of course,' she said.

305
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,710
'And have you met my little Basil as well?'

306
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,380
She nodded towards the dog curled up so comfortably
in front of the fire.

307
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,700
Billy looked at it.

308
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,860
Suddenly he realized that this animal had
all the time been as silent and motionless

309
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,669
as the parrot.

310
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:09,380
He touched it gently on the top of its back.

311
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,380
It was hard and cold but perfectly preserved.

312
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,380
'Good heavens,' he said.

313
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,210
'How very interesting.

314
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,940
It must be awfully difficult to do a thing
like that.'

315
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,720
'Not at all,' she said.

316
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,510
'I stuff all my little pets myself when they
die.

317
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,300
Will you have another cup of tea?'

318
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,140
'No, thank you,' Billy said.

319
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,970
The tea tasted faintly bitter and he didn't
really like it.

320
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,610
'You did sign the book, didn't you?'

321
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,130
'Oh, yes.'

322
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,660
'That's good.

323
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,550
Because later, if I forget what you were called,
then I can always look it up.

324
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:58,299
I still do that every day with Mr Mulholland
and Mr...

325
00:19:58,299 --> 00:19:59,880
Mr...'

326
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,250
'Temple,' Billy said.

327
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,440
'Gregory Temple.

328
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,300
Excuse me for asking, but haven't there been
any other guests here except them in the last

329
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,980
two or three years?'

330
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,250
Holding her teacup high in one hand, moving
her head slightly to the left, she looked

331
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,360
at him out of the corners of her eyes and
gave him another gentle little smile.

332
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,240
'No, my dear,' she said.

333
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
'Only you.'

334
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,970
- THE END -
