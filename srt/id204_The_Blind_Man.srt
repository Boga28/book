1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,600
Maurice didn't think much or worry much.  

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,160
While he had the power of touch, 
he was happy without sight.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,920
Isabel Pervin was listening for two 
sounds - for the sound of wheels on  

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,240
the drive outside and for the noise of 
her husband's footsteps in the hall.  

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,800
It was the late afternoon of a rainy November day. 
Her dearest and oldest friend was on his way from  

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,680
the station. Her husband, who had been blinded 
in the war in France, was outside somewhere.

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,800
Maurice had been home for a year now. He was 
badly scared and totally blind, but they had  

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,040
been very happy. Grange Farm was Maurice's place. 
The farm workers lived at the back of the house,  

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,640
while Isabel lived with her husband in the 
comfortable rooms at the front. They had  

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,440
spent most of their time alone together since his 
return. They talked and sang and read, together.  

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,280
She wrote short pieces for a newspaper and he did 
some work on the farm - simple work, it is true,  

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but it gave him satisfaction. He milked the 
cows and looked after the pigs and horses.  

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,000
Life was still very full for the blind man,  

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:32,640
peaceful in darkness. With his wife, 
he had a whole world, rich and real.

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,480
But sometimes their happiness 
left them. In that silent house,  

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:48,000
Isabel sometimes felt she was going crazy. 
And sometimes her husband became despairing.  

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,000
She tried then to force the old cheerfulness 
to continue bat the effort was almost too  

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
much for her. At such times, she would 
give anything, anything, to escape.

19
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,680
She looked for a way out. She invited 
friends. She tried to give her husband  

20
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,720
some further connection with the 
outside world. But it was no good.

21
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,480
Nobody could understand the depth of the 
experiences that they had shared in the past year.

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,840
But now, in a few weeks' time, 
her second baby would be born.  

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,080
The first had died while 
her husband was in France.  

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,280
She looked forward with pleasure to the coming of 
the second, but she also felt a little anxious.  

25
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,720
The child would take her love and attention. 
And then, what about Maurice? What would he do?

26
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
It was at this time that Isabel's old 
friend, Bertie Reid,, wrote to her.  

27
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,840
All her life he had been her friend - like 
a brother, but better than her own brothers.  

28
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,800
She loved him, though not in the same 
way as the man she had chosen to marry.

29
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,160
Bertie was a lawyer, a 
thoughtful type with a quick mind  

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,440
Maurice was different. He was slow 
and sensitive - a big, heavy man.  

31
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,200
The two men had never been close. Isabel thought 
they should like each other. But they did not.

32
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,960
So when Maurice was going out to France,  

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,640
she wrote to Bertie saying that she 
must end her friendship with him.

34
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,840
For nearly two years, there had been no 
communication between the two friends.  

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,360
Then a little note came from Bertie. He wrote of 
the real pain he felt about Maurice's blindness.  

36
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,200
Isabel felt a nervous excitement again, 
and she read the letter to Maurice.

37
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,840
'Ask him to come down,' he said.

38
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,160
'Ask Bertie to come here?'

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,840
'Yes - if he wants to.'

40
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,560
Isabel thought about this.

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:17,040
'I know he wants to,' she replied. 'But what 
about you, Maurice? How would you like it?'

42
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,280
'I should like it.'

43
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,840
'Well - in that case - But I 
thought you didn't care for him-'

44
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,880
"Oh, I don't know. I might think differently 
of him now," the blind man replied.

45
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
So Bertie was coming, coming this evening,  

46
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,720
in the November rain and. darkness. Isabel 
looked nervously again at the high windows,  

47
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,160
where the rain was beating against the 
glass. Maurice was out in the stable.

48
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,160
She stood up and looked at herself in the mirror.  

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:04,080
Her face was calm. Her neck made a beautiful line 
to her shoulder. She had a warm, motherly look.

50
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,920
She passed down the wide hall and put on 
heavy shoes, a large coat and a man's hat.  

51
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,840
Then she went outside. It was very 
dark and very windy. As she walked on,  

52
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,760
the darkness seemed deeper, and she was sorry 
she had not brought a lamp. Rain blew against  

53
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,440
her. She half liked it and she half felt 
that she did not want to light against it.

54
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:43,200
She reached the door of the stable. There was no 
light anywhere. She opened the door and looked in,  

55
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,440
into total darkness. The sudden 
smell of horses shocked her.  

56
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,640
She listened but could only hear the night 
and the restless movement of a horse.

57
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,840
'Maurice!' she called softly. 
'Maurice - are you there?'

58
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,760
Nothing came from the darkness. The rain and the 
wind were blowing in, so she entered and shut the  

59
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,320
door. She was conscious of the horses, though 
she could not see them, and she was afraid.

60
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,440
Then she heard a small noise in the distance. 
It was Maurice in the other part of the stable.  

61
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,840
The low sound of his voice as he spoke to 
the horses came to her in the darkness.

62
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,360
She called quietly, 'Maurice, Maurice - dear!'

63
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,040
'Yes,' he answered. 'Isabel?'

64
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,560
She saw nothing, and the sound 
of his voice seemed to touch her.

65
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,720
'Won't you come in, dear?' she said.

66
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:03,680
'Yes, I'm coming. Just half a minute. 
Bertie hasn't arrived yet, has he?'

67
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
'Not yet,' said Isabel.

68
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,840
She wanted him to come to her. When she 
could not see him, she was frightened of him.

69
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,240
'Bertie won't much enjoy the drive in this 
weather,' he said, as he closed the door.

70
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:33,200
'No, he won't!' said Isabel calmly, watching the 
dark shape at the door. 'Give me your arm, dear.'

71
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,840
Isabel was pleased to be back in the house.  

72
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,120
She was a little afraid of him out there in 
the darkness. In the hall, he sat down heavily.  

73
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,400
As he bent down to take off his 
boots, he didn't seem blind.  

74
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,840
When he stood up, the blood rushed to his face 
and neck, and she didn't look at his eyes.

75
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,520
He went away upstairs. She 
saw him go into the darkness.  

76
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,240
He did not know that the lamps upstairs 
were not lit. She heard him in the bathroom.

77
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,240
Maurice moved around almost unconsciously.  

78
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,480
He seemed to know where things were before he 
touched them. He didn't think much or worry much.

79
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,200
While he had the power of touch, 
he was happy without sight.  

80
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,280
It was a pleasure to stretch out his hands 
and pick up something that he couldn't see,  

81
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:40,720
to hold it and to own it. He didn't try to 
remember what it looked like. He didn't want to.  

82
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,120
This new consciousness had become natural to him.  

83
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,120
He was generally happy and he 
had a burning love for Isabel.  

84
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,920
But at times despair swept over him and 
destroyed his happiness. Then he suffered.

85
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,360
But tonight he was still calm, though his senses 
were a little sharp. His hearing was too sharp.  

86
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,440
He was conscious of all the sounds in the house. 
As he went to his room, he heard a vehicle arrive.

87
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,280
Then came Isabel's voice, like a 
bell ringing. 'Is it you, Bertie?'

88
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,440
And a man's voice answered out 
of the wind. 'Hello, Isabel.  

89
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,080
There you are. You're looking as fit as ever.'

90
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:44,400
'Oh yes,' said Isabel. 'I'm very well. 
How are you? Rather thin, I think -'

91
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,640
'Worked, to death. But I'm all 
right. How's Maurice? Isn't he here?'

92
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,800
'Oh yes, he's upstairs, changing 
his clothes. Yes, he's well.'

93
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,680
They moved away. Maurice heard no more. But a 
childish sense of despair had come over him.  

94
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:17,840
He felt shut out- like a child in the company of 
adults. He dressed himself and went downstairs.

95
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,560
Isabel was alone in the sitting 
room. She watched him enter.

96
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,760
'Did you hear Bertie come, Maurice?' she said.

97
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,080
'Yes - isn't he here?'

98
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,080
'He's in his room. He looks very thin and tired.'

99
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,600
Bertie came down. He was a little 
dark man, with a very big forehead,  

100
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,840
thin hair, and sad, large eyes. 
He had strange, short legs.  

101
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,520
Isabel watched him pause at the door, 
and look nervously at her husband.

102
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,400
Bertie went across to Maurice.

103
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,600
The blind man put his hand out and Bertie 
took it. Isabel watched them anxiously,  

104
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,360
and then looked away again.

105
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,480
'Come,' she said. 'Come to the 
table. Aren't you both hungry?'

106
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,400
They sat down.

107
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,080
Maurice felt for his place, his knife and fork.  

108
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,840
Bertie picked up a little bowl of flowers 
from the table, and held them to his nose.

109
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,640
'They have a lovely sweet smell,' 
he said. 'Where do they come from?'

110
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,640
'From the garden - under the windows. Bertie, do 
you remember the flowers under Aunt Bell's wall?'

111
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,160
The two friends looked at each other and smiled.

112
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The meal continued and Isabel 
and Bertie spoke easily together.  

113
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:01,040
The blind man was silent. He ate carefully 
but quickly. He could never accept any help.

114
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,640
After the meal, the three sat around the fire.  

115
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,160
Isabel put more wood on and Bertie noticed 
a slight slowness in her movements.

116
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,240
'Will you be pleased when the 
child comes, Isabel?' he said.

117
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,960
She looked at him with a smile.

118
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,280
'Yes, I shall be very pleased. So will 
you, Maurice, won't you?' she added.

119
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,920
'Yes, I shall,' replied her husband.

120
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,800
'We are both looking forward 
to it so much,' she said.

121
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,280
'Yes, of course,' said Bertie.

122
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,120
He was three or four years older than Isabel 
and had never married. He had other women  

123
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,560
friends - but they were friends, not lovers. If 
they seemed to come too close, he pulled away.  

124
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:07,360
Isabel knew him very well, his kindness, but 
also his weakness, which made him unable ever  

125
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,920
to enter into any close human relationships. He 
was ashamed of himself because he couldn't marry.  

126
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:25,120
He wanted to, but he couldn't. Deep down inside 
he was afraid. He became a successful lawyer,  

127
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:33,840
a rich man and a great social success. But 
at the centre he felt that he was nothing.

128
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,200
Isabel looked at his sad face and his short 
little legs. She looked at his dark grey eyes.  

129
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,320
There was something childlike 
in him and she loved him.  

130
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,840
At the same time, she pitied and disliked 
his weakness. He understood this.

131
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
Suddenly, Bertie spoke to Maurice.

132
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,720
'Isabel tells me that you have not 
suffered too badly from losing your sight.'  

133
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,040
Maurice straightened himself.

134
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,440
'No,' he said, 'not too badly. You 
stop worrying about many things.'

135
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,160
'And that is good,' said Bertie. 'But 
what is it that takes the place of worry?'

136
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,360
Maurice was slow in replying.

137
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,480
'There is something,' Maurice said. 
'But I couldn't tell you what it is.'

138
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:43,840
Then the blind man was silent. He stood up slowly, 
a big, uncomfortable figure. He wanted to go away.

139
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,360
'Do you mind,' he said, 'if I go and speak 
to the farm manager? I won't be long.'

140
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,840
'No - go along, dear,' said Isabel.

141
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:07,280
And he went out. A silence came over the 
two friends. The wind blew loudly outside.  

142
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:17,440
Rain beat like a drum on the windows. The wood in 
the fireplace burned lowly with hot small flames.  

143
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,640
Bertie seemed uncomfortable. There were dark  

144
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,040
circles around his eyes. 
Isabel looked into the fire.

145
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,640
'The child coming seems to make me calm. I 
feel there's nothing to worry about,' she said.

146
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,680
'A good thing, I should 
say,' Bertie replied slowly.

147
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,240
'If I didn't feel anxious about 
Maurice, I'd be quite happy.'

148
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,280
The evening passed slowly. 
Isabel looked at the clock.

149
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,760
'It's nearly ten o'clock,' she 
said. 'Where can Maurice be?'

150
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,200
Bertie looked at her. 'Would 
you like me to go out and see?'

151
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,880
'Well - if you wouldn't mind. I'd go, but 
-' She did not want to make the effort.

152
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,840
Bertie put on an old coat and took a lamp. 
He left by the side door. He felt nervous  

153
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,360
and strangely empty. He walked slowly 
through the wet and stormy right.

154
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:40,880
At last, he opened the door of a stable and, 
looking in, he saw Maurice standing, listening.

155
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,960
'Who is that?' said Maurice.

156
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,200
'It's me,' said Bertie. He entered 
and shut the door behind him.

157
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,520
'You came to look for me?' he asked.

158
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,840
'Isabel was a little worried, said Bertie.

159
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,920
'I'll come in.'

160
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,920
'I hope I'm not in your way at 
all,' said Bertie, rather shyly.

161
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:17,840
'My way?' Maurice said. 'Not a bit. I'm 
pleased Isabel has someone to talk to.  

162
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,960
I'm afraid that I am in the way. 
I know I'm not very good company.  

163
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,120
Is Isabel all right, do you 
think? She's not unhappy, is she?'

164
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,840
'I don't think so.'

165
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,320
'What does she say?'

166
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:43,040
'She says she's very happy - only a little 
worried about you,' said Bertie carefully.

167
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,640
'She needn't worry about me.  

168
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,080
I'm afraid that she'll find me dull, 
always alone with me down here.'

169
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:04,000
Maurice lowered his voice and took 
a deep breath. 'Bertie,' he asked,  

170
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,840
'is my face a very ugly sight? 
Do you mind telling me?'

171
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,840
'There is a scar,' said. Bertie, surprised.  

172
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,720
'But one feels pity more than 
shock at the sight of it.'

173
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,840
'A bad scar, though,' said Maurice.

174
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,840
'Oh, yes.'

175
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,280
There was a pause.

176
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,880
'I don't really know you, do I?' Maurice 
said suddenly in a strange voice.  

177
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,640
'Probably not,' said Bertie.

178
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,520
'Do you mind if I touch you?'

179
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,200
Bertie stepped back but said, 
in a small voice, 'Not at all.'

180
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,360
He suffered as the blind man stretched 
out a strong hand and felt his head.  

181
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,800
He covered the face of the smaller 
man, touching the forehead,  

182
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,840
the closed eyes, the small nose, 
the mouth, the strong chin.

183
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,880
'You seem young,' Maurice said quietly, at last.

184
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,760
Bertie stood, nearly destroyed, unable to answer.

185
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:38,320
'Your head seems soft,' Maurice 
continued. 'So do your hands.  

186
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,320
Touch my eyes, will you? Touch my scar.'

187
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,680
Bertie was sickened by the idea, but he 
was under the power of the blind man.  

188
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,840
He lifted his hand, and touched the scar. 
Maurice suddenly covered it with his own hand,  

189
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,840
pressed the fingers of the 
other man onto his scarred eyes.  

190
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,440
He stayed in this position for a minute 
or more while Bertie froze, helpless.

191
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,480
Then, suddenly, Maurice took the other man's 
hand away and stood holding it in his own.

192
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:33,840
'Oh my God,' he said. 'We shall know each other 
now, shan't we? We shall know each other now.'

193
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,560
Bertie could not answer. He looked at 
the blind man silently and in terror,  

194
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,360
despairing at his own weakness. 
He knew that he could not answer.  

195
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,880
He had an unreasonable fear that the 
other man would suddenly destroy him.  

196
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:59,280
Maurice was actually filled with a burning desire 
for friendship - and Bertie only wanted to escape.

197
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:11,440
'It's all right now, as long as we live. We're 
all right together now, aren't we?' Maurice said.

198
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,840
'Yes,' said Bertie.

199
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,080
Maurice turned to pick up his coat.

200
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,960
'Come,' he said, 'we'll go to Isabel.'

201
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,840
Bertie took the lamp and opened the 
door. The two men went in silence.

202
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,200
Isabel heard their footsteps and looked up 
anxiously as they entered. There seemed a  

203
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,480
strange happiness in Maurice. Bertie looked 
tired. His eyes were darker than before.

204
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,840
'What is it?' she asked.

205
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,400
'We've become friends,' said Maurice.

206
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,920
She looked at Bertie. He met 
her eyes with a despairing look.

207
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,520
'I'm so pleased,' she said, confused.

208
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,960
'Yes,' said Maurice.

209
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,800
Isabel took his hand with both 
of hers and held it tight.

210
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,800
'You'll be happier now, dear,' she said.

211
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:27,120
But she was watching Bertie. She knew that he 
had one desire - to escape from this friendship,  

212
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:39,840
which had been forced on him. He could not accept 
that he had been touched by the blind man.
 
 
 
 

213
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,727
- THE END -
