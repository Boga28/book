1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:07,543
And next time I’ll have along a
gentle hawss for yu’.”

2
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:10,063
“Next time!

3
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:12,253
Next time!

4
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:16,693
Well, perhaps I will go with you.

5
00:00:16,693 --> 00:00:18,613
Do you live far?”

6
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:23,597
“I live on Judge Henry’s
ranch, over yondeh.”

7
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:26,717
He pointed across the mountains.

8
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:29,468
“It’s on Sunk Creek.

9
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:35,268
A pretty rough trail;
but I can come hyeh to see you in

10
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:40,557
a day, I reckon.

11
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:51,174
Well, I hope you’ll cert’nly
enjoy good health, ma’am.”

12
00:00:51,174 --> 00:00:57,189
“Oh, there’s one thing!”

13
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:01,980
said Molly Wood, calling
after him rather quickly.

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,800
“I⁠—I’m not at all afraid of horses.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,853
You needn’t bring such a gentle one.

16
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:20,275
I⁠—was very tired that day,
and⁠—and I don’t scream as a rule.”

17
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:26,613
He turned and looked at her so that she
could not meet his glance.

18
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:29,604
“Bless your heart!”

19
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:31,857
said he.

20
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:37,711
“Will yu’ give me one o’ those flowers?”

21
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,270
“Oh, certainly!

22
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:48,390
I’m always so glad when people like them.”

23
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,988
“They’re pretty near the
color of your eyes.”

24
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:57,508
“Never mind my eyes.”

25
00:01:57,508 --> 00:02:01,092
“Can’t help it, ma’am.

26
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:03,207
Not since South Fork.”

27
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:07,662
He put the flower in the leather band of
his hat, and rode away

28
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:12,056
on his Monte horse.

29
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:20,401
Miss Wood lingered a moment,
then made some steps toward her gate,

30
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:29,382
from which he could still be seen;
and then, with something like a toss of

31
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:36,356
the head, she went in and shut her door.

32
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:45,442
Later in the day the Virginian met Mr.
McLean, who looked at his hat and

33
00:02:45,442 --> -1:59:59,000
innocently quoted, “ ‘My
Looloo picked a daisy.’

34
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

35
00:02:51,886 --> 00:02:56,102
“Don’t yu’, Lin,” said the Southerner.

36
00:02:56,102 --> 00:02:58,662
“Then I won’t,” said Lin.

37
00:02:58,662 --> 00:03:05,865
Thus, for this occasion,
did the Virginian part from his lady⁠—

38
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:11,865
and nothing said one way or another about
the handkerchief that had disappeared

39
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:15,455
during the South Fork incident.

40
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:22,776
As we fall asleep at night,
our thoughts will often ramble back and

41
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:26,748
forth between the two worlds.

42
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,178
“What color were his eyes?”

43
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:34,100
wondered Molly on her pillow.

44
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,632
“His mustache is not bristly like
so many of them.

45
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:45,232
Sam never gave me such a
look at Hoosic Junction.

46
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:47,592
No.⁠ ⁠

47
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:49,992
… You can’t come with me.⁠ ⁠

48
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:52,552
… Get off your horse.⁠ ⁠

49
00:03:52,552 --> -1:59:59,000
… The passengers are all staring.⁠ ⁠

50
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
…”

51
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:08,286
And while Molly was thus dreaming that
the Virginian had ridden his horse into

52
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:16,257
the railroad car, and sat down beside
her, the fire in the great stone chimney

53
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:24,978
of her cabin flickered quietly,
its gleams now and again touching the

54
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:30,710
miniature of Grandmother
Stark upon the wall.

55
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:37,350
Camped on the Sunk Creek trail,
the Virginian was telling

56
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,911
himself in his blankets:⁠—

57
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:43,271
“I ain’t too old for education.

58
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:46,471
Maybe she will lend me books.

59
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:52,773
And I’ll watch her ways and
learn⁠ ⁠… stand still, Monte.

60
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:58,214
I can learn a lot more than
the kids on that.

61
00:04:58,214 --> -1:59:59,000
There’s Monte⁠

62
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
⁠…

63
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:04,156
you pie-biter, stop.⁠ ⁠

64
00:05:04,156 --> -1:59:59,000
… He has ate up your book,
ma’am, but I’ll get yu’.⁠ ⁠

65
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
…”

66
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,607
And then the Virginian was fast asleep.

67
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:16,806
CHAPTER XII

68
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:18,942
Quality and Equality

69
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:26,877
To the circle at Bennington,
a letter from Bear Creek was always a

70
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:36,954
welcome summons to gather and hear of
doings very strange to Vermont.

71
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:41,765
And when the tale of the changed babies
arrived duly by the post,

72
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:49,568
it created a more than usual sensation,
and was read to a large number of

73
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:53,621
pleased and scandalized neighbors.

74
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:59,282
“I hate her to be where such things can
happen,” said Mrs. Wood.

75
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:09,267
“I wish I could have been there,”
said her son-in-law, Andrew Bell.

76
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:19,948
“She does not mention who played the
trick,” said Mrs. Andrew Bell.

77
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:26,049
“We shouldn’t be any wiser if she
did,” said Mrs. Wood.

78
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:35,433
“I’d like to meet the
perpetrator,” said Andrew.

79
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:38,364
“Oh, no!”

80
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,333
said Mrs. Wood.

81
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:45,818
“They’re all horrible.”

82
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:52,700
And she wrote at once,
begging her daughter to take good care

83
00:06:52,700 --> 00:07:03,455
of herself, and to see as much of
Mrs. Balaam as possible.

84
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:07,217
“And of any other ladies
that are near you.

85
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:13,508
For you seem to me to be in
a community of roughs.

86
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:17,246
I wish you would give it all up.

87
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:24,627
Did you expect me to laugh
about the babies?”

88
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:25,225
Mrs.

89
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:33,579
Flynt, when this story was repeated to
her (she had not been invited in to hear

90
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:39,231
the letter), remarked that she had
always felt that Molly Wood must be a

91
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:46,544
little vulgar, ever since she began to
go about giving music lessons

92
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:50,152
like any ordinary German.

93
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:57,035
But Mrs. Wood was considerably relieved
when the next letter arrived.

94
00:07:57,035 --> 00:08:06,056
It contained nothing horrible
about barbecues or babies.

95
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:14,287
It mentioned the great beauty of the
weather, and how well and strong the

96
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:19,881
fine air was making the writer feel.

97
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:26,621
And it asked that books might be sent,
many books of all sorts,

98
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:36,053
novels, poetry, all the good old books
and any good new ones

99
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,785
that could be spared.

100
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,776
Cheap editions, of course.

101
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:44,396
“Indeed she shall have them!”

102
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:46,437
said Mrs. Wood.

103
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:51,667
“How her mind must be starving
in that dreadful place!”

104
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:58,960
The letter was not a long one,
and, besides the books,

105
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,600
spoke of little else except the fine
weather and the chances for outdoor

106
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,323
exercise that this gave.

107
00:09:09,323 --> 00:09:16,314
“You have no idea,” it said,
“how delightful it is to ride,

108
00:09:16,314 --> -1:59:59,000
especially on a spirited horse,
which I can do now quite well.

109
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

110
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:24,238
“How nice that is!”

111
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:28,549
said Mrs. Wood, putting down the letter.

112
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:32,199
“I hope the horse is not too spirited.”

113
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:35,753
“Who does she go riding with?”

114
00:09:35,753 --> 00:09:38,153
asked Mrs. Bell.

115
00:09:38,153 --> 00:09:40,833
“She doesn’t say, Sarah.

116
00:09:40,833 --> -1:59:59,000
Why?

117
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

118
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,174
“Nothing.

119
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:50,217
She has a queer way of not mentioning
things, now and then.”

120
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:51,195
“Sarah!”

121
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:56,445
exclaimed Mrs. Wood, reproachfully.

122
00:09:56,445 --> 00:10:03,425
“Oh, well, mother, you know just as well
as I do that she can be

123
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:07,185
very independent and unconventional.”

124
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:10,897
“Yes; but not in that way.

125
00:10:10,897 --> -1:59:59,000
She wouldn’t ride with poor Sam Bannett,
and after all he is a suitable person.

126
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

127
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:31,609
Nevertheless, in her next letter,
Mrs. Wood cautioned her daughter about

128
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:43,592
trusting herself with any one of whom
Mrs. Balaam did not thoroughly approve.

129
00:10:43,592 --> 00:11:01,820
The good lady could never grasp that Mrs.
Balaam lived a long day’s journey from

130
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:08,460
Bear Creek, and that Molly saw her about
once every three months.

131
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:17,569
“We have sent your books,”
the mother wrote; “everybody has

132
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:22,479
contributed from their store⁠—
Shakespeare, Tennyson,

133
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:27,046
Browning, Longfellow;
and a number of novels by Scott,

134
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:33,346
Thackeray, George Eliot,
Hawthorne, and lesser writers;

135
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:40,986
some volumes of Emerson;
and Jane Austen complete,

136
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:45,790
because you admire her so particularly.”

137
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:51,907
This consignment of literature reached
Bear Creek about a week

138
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:54,907
before Christmas time.

139
00:11:54,907 --> 00:12:00,947
By New Year’s Day, the Virginian
had begun his education.

140
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:07,177
“Well, I have managed to get through
’em,” he said, as he entered

141
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,297
Molly’s cabin in February.

142
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:13,337
And he laid two volumes upon her table.

143
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:15,989
“And what do you think of them?”

144
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:17,879
she inquired.

145
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:24,139
“I think that I’ve cert’nly earned a
good long ride today.”

146
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:28,799
“Georgie Taylor has sprained his ankle.”

147
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,653
“No, I don’t mean that kind of a ride.

148
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:40,458
I’ve earned a ride with just us two alone.

149
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:45,674
I’ve read every word of both
of ’em, yu’ know.”

150
00:12:45,674 --> 00:12:48,114
“I’ll think about it.

151
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:52,659
Did you like them?”

152
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:53,839
“No.

153
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,222
Not much.

154
00:12:56,222 --> 00:13:06,235
If I’d knowed that one was a detective
story, I’d have got yu’ to try

155
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:09,475
something else on me.

156
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:17,656
Can you guess the murderer,
or is the author too smart for yu’?

157
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:20,216
That’s all they amount to.

158
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:29,160
Well, he was too smart for me this time,
but that didn’t distress me any.

159
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,460
That other book talks too much.”

160
00:13:34,460 --> -1:59:59,000
Molly was scandalized,
and she told him it was a great work.

161
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
“

162
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:49,044
Oh, yes, yes.

163
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:51,804
A fine book.

164
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:59,067
But it will keep up its talkin’.

165
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:01,361
Don’t let you alone.”

166
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:07,419
“Didn’t you feel sorry
for poor Maggie Tulliver?”

167
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:11,426
“Hmp.

168
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,066
Yes.

169
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:17,502
Sorry for her, and for Tawmmy, too.

170
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:24,563
But the man did right to drownd ’em both.”

171
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,774
“It wasn’t a man.

172
00:14:26,774 --> 00:14:29,014
A woman wrote that.”

173
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:31,294
“A woman did!

174
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:35,159
Well, then, o’ course she talks too much.”

175
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,570
“I’ll not go riding with you!”

176
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,503
shrieked Molly.

177
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,420
But she did.

178
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,432
And he returned to Sunk Creek,
not with a detective story,

179
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:47,240
but this time with a Russian novel.

180
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,719
It was almost April when he brought it
back to her⁠—and a heavy sleet storm

181
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:53,029
lost them their ride.

182
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,429
So he spent his time indoors with her,
not speaking a syllable of love.

183
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:02,125
When he came to take his departure,
he asked her for some other book

184
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,315
by this same Russian.

185
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:05,518
But she had no more.

186
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:07,233
“I wish you had,” he said.

187
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:10,946
“I’ve never saw a book could tell the
truth like that one does.”

188
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:13,017
“Why, what do you like about it?”

189
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:14,537
she exclaimed.

190
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:16,811
To her it had been distasteful.

191
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:19,247
“Everything,” he answered.

192
00:15:19,247 --> 00:15:23,391
“That young come-outer,
and his fam’ly that can’t understand

193
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:31,264
him⁠—for he is broad gauge,
yu’ see, and they are narro’ gauge.”

194
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,853
The Virginian looked at Molly
a moment almost shyly.

195
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:38,955
“Do you know,” he said,
and a blush spread over his face,

196
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:43,626
“I pretty near cried when that young
come-outer was dyin’, and said about

197
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,650
himself, ‘I was a giant.’

198
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,044
Life made him broad gauge,
yu’ see, and then took his chance away.”

199
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:53,876
Molly liked the Virginian for his blush.

200
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:55,750
It made him very handsome.

201
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,988
But she thought that it came from his
confession about “pretty near crying.”

202
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:05,009
The deeper cause she failed
to divine⁠—that

203
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:05,409
he

204
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:10,402
, like the dying hero in the novel,
felt himself to be a giant whom life had

205
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,982
made “broad gauge,” and
denied opportunity.

206
00:16:12,982 --> 00:16:19,637
Fecund nature begets and squanders
thousands of these rich seeds in

207
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:21,318
the wilderness of life.

208
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:24,317
He took away with him
a volume of Shakespeare.

209
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,669
“I’ve saw good plays of his,” he remarked.

210
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:32,960
Kind Mrs. Taylor in her cabin next door
watched him ride off in the sleet,

211
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,865
bound for the lonely mountain trail.

212
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:38,720
“If that girl don’t get ready to take him
pretty soon,” she observed to her

213
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,328
husband, “I’ll give her a
piece of my mind.”

214
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:42,896
Taylor was astonished.

215
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,358
“Is he thinking of her?”

216
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:45,411
he inquired.

217
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:47,660
“Lord, Mr. Taylor, and why shouldn’t he?”

218
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,991
Mr. Taylor scratched his head and
returned to his newspaper.

219
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:55,161
It was warm⁠—warm and
beautiful upon Bear Creek.

220
00:16:55,161 --> 00:17:00,242
Snow shone upon the peaks of the Bow Leg
range; lower on their slopes the pines

221
00:17:00,242 --> 00:17:04,562
were stirring with a gentle song;
and flowers bloomed across the wide

222
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:05,842
plains at their feet.

223
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:11,025
Molly and her Virginian sat at a certain
spring where he had often

224
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:11,914
ridden with her.

225
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:17,458
On this day he was bidding her farewell
before undertaking the most important

226
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,456
trust which Judge Henry had
as yet given him.

227
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:25,259
For this journey she had provided him
with Sir Walter Scott’s Kenilworth.

228
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:27,457
Shakespeare he had returned to her.

229
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:29,995
He had bought Shakespeare for himself.

230
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:33,949
“As soon as I got used to readin’ it,”
he had told her, “I knowed for certain

231
00:17:33,949 --> -1:59:59,000
that I liked readin’ for enjoyment.

232
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

233
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:39,781
But it was not of books that he
had spoken much today.

234
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:42,043
He had not spoken at all.

235
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:48,215
He had bade her listen to the meadowlark,
when its song fell upon the silence like

236
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:49,799
beaded drops of music.

237
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,374
He had showed her where a covey of young
willow-grouse were hiding

238
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:55,215
as their horses passed.

239
00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:59,818
And then, without warning,
as they sat by the spring,

240
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:02,523
he had spoken potently of his love.

241
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:04,729
She did not interrupt him.

242
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:07,390
She waited until he was wholly finished.

243
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,458
“I am not the sort of wife you want,”
she said, with an attempt of airiness.

244
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,524
He answered roughly, “I am
the judge of that.”

245
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:19,893
And his roughness was a pleasure to her,
yet it made her afraid of herself.

246
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:23,693
When he was absent from her,
and she could sit in her cabin and look

247
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:26,900
at Grandmother Stark,
and read home letters,

248
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,717
then in imagination she found it easy to
play the part which she had arranged to

249
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:35,957
play regarding him⁠—the part of the
guide, and superior,

250
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:39,458
and indulgent companion.

251
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:43,112
But when he was by her side,
that part became a difficult one.

252
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:47,553
Her woman’s fortress was shaken by a
force unknown to her before.

253
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:52,470
Sam Bannett did not have it in him to
look as this man could look,

254
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,665
when the cold lustre of his eyes grew
hot with internal fire.

255
00:18:57,665 --> 00:19:00,077
What color they were baffled her still.

256
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:02,306
“Can it possibly change?”

257
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:03,057
she wondered.

258
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:06,706
It seemed to her that sometimes when she
had been looking from a rock straight

259
00:19:06,706 --> 00:19:09,908
down into clear sea water,
this same color had lurked in its

260
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:10,591
depths.

261
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:13,420
“Is it green, or is it gray?”

262
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,410
she asked herself, but did not turn
just now to see.

263
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,910
She kept her face toward the landscape.

264
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,733
“All men are born equal,”
he now remarked slowly.

265
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:28,362
“Yes,” she quickly answered,
with a combative flash.

266
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:28,985
“Well?”

267
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:31,262
“Maybe that don’t include women?”

268
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:32,138
he suggested.

269
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,526
“I think it does.”

270
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:35,369
“Do yu’ tell the kids so?”

271
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:38,366
“Of course I teach them what I believe!”

272
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:39,167
He pondered.

273
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:45,174
“I used to have to learn about
the Declaration of Independence.

274
00:19:45,174 --> 00:19:48,004
I hated books and truck when I was a kid.”

275
00:19:48,004 --> 00:19:49,371
“But you don’t any more.”

276
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:49,989
“No.

277
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,638
I cert’nly don’t.

278
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:57,461
But I used to get kep’ in at recess
for bein’ so dumb.

279
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:02,426
I was most always at the tail
end of the class.

280
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:04,937
My brother, he’d be head sometimes.”

281
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:10,041
“Little George Taylor is my
prize scholar,” said Molly.

282
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,031
“Knows his tasks, does he?”

283
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:13,055
“Always.

284
00:20:13,055 --> 00:20:14,936
And Henry Dow comes next.”

285
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:16,621
“Who’s last?”

286
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:17,976
“Poor Bob Carmody.

287
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:21,496
I spend more time on him than on all
the rest put together.”

288
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:22,779
“My!”

289
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:23,727
said the Virginian.

290
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:25,098
“Ain’t that strange!”

291
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,692
She looked at him, puzzled by his tone.

292
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:30,709
“It’s not strange when you
know Bob,” she said.

293
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:34,364
“It’s very strange,” drawled
the Virginian.

294
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:38,931
“Knowin’ Bob don’t help it any.”

295
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:43,258
“I don’t think that I understand
you,” said Molly, sticky.

296
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:45,727
“Well, it is mighty confusin’.

297
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:50,207
George Taylor, he’s your best scholar,
and poor Bob, he’s your worst,

298
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,768
and there’s a lot in the middle⁠—and you
tell me we’re all born equal!”

299
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:58,346
Molly could only sit giggling in this
trap he had so ingeniously laid for her.

300
00:20:58,346 --> 00:21:01,570
“I’ll tell you what,”
pursued the cowpuncher,

301
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:07,062
with slow and growing intensity,
“equality is a great big bluff.

302
00:21:07,062 --> -1:59:59,000
It’s easy called.

303
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

304
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:10,946
“I didn’t mean⁠—” began Molly.

305
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:13,012
“Wait, and let me say what I mean.”

306
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:15,574
He had made an imperious
gesture with his hand.

307
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,733
“I know a man that mostly wins at cyards.

308
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:21,236
I know a man that mostly loses.

309
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:23,716
He says it is his luck.

310
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:24,603
All right.

311
00:21:24,603 --> 00:21:26,053
Call it his luck.

312
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:29,609
I know a man that works hard and he’s
gettin’ rich, and I know another that

313
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:31,835
works hard and is gettin’ poor.

314
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:33,557
He says it is his luck.

315
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:34,702
All right.

316
00:21:34,702 --> 00:21:35,884
Call it his luck.

317
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:40,624
I look around and I see folks movin’ up
or movin’ down, winners

318
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:42,551
or losers everywhere.

319
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,440
All luck, of course.

320
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,996
But since folks can be born that
different in their luck,

321
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:49,356
where’s your equality?

322
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:50,715
No, seh!

323
00:21:50,715 --> 00:21:54,767
call your failure luck,
or call it laziness,

324
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:59,711
wander around the words,
prospect all yu’ mind to,

325
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:03,225
and yu’ll come out the same
old trail of inequality.”

326
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:05,346
He paused a moment and looked at her.

327
00:22:05,346 --> 00:22:09,864
“Some holds four aces,”
he went on, “and some holds nothin’, and

328
00:22:09,864 --> 00:22:15,890
some poor fello’ gets the aces and no
show to play ’em; but a man has got to

329
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,221
prove himself my equal
before I’ll believe him.”

330
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:21,939
Molly sat gazing at him, silent.

331
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:25,281
“I know what yu’ meant,”
he told her now, “by sayin’ you’re not

332
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:26,568
the wife I’d want.

333
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:29,029
But I am the kind that moves up.

334
00:22:29,029 --> -1:59:59,000
I am goin’ to be your best scholar

335
-1:59:59,000 --> -1:59:59,000
.

336
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

337
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:34,589
He turned toward her,
and that fortress within

338
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:36,172
her began to shake.

339
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:37,796
“Don’t,” she murmured.

340
00:22:37,796 --> -1:59:59,000
“Don’t, please.

341
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

342
00:22:39,932 --> 00:22:41,043
“Don’t what?”

343
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:43,220
“Why⁠—spoil this.”

344
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,427
“Spoil it?”

345
00:22:44,427 --> 00:22:51,971
“These rides⁠—I don’t love you⁠—I can’t⁠—
but these rides are⁠—”

346
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,102
“What are they?”

347
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:55,606
“My greatest pleasure.

348
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:56,302
There!

349
00:22:56,302 --> 00:23:00,023
And, please, I want them to go on so.”

350
00:23:00,023 --> 00:23:01,194
“Go on so!

351
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:03,190
I don’t reckon yu’ know
what you’re sayin’.

352
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,076
Yu’ might as well ask fruit to stay green.

353
00:23:06,076 --> 00:23:10,183
If the way we are now can keep bein’
enough for you, it can’t for me.

354
00:23:10,183 --> 00:23:11,913
A pleasure to you, is it?

355
00:23:11,913 --> 00:23:15,500
Well, to me it is⁠—I don’t know
what to call it.

356
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,187
I come to yu’ and I hate it,
and I come again and I hate it,

357
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:24,494
and I ache and grieve all over when I
go.

358
00:23:24,494 --> 00:23:25,564
No!

359
00:23:25,564 --> -1:59:59,000
You will have to think of some other way
than just invitin’ me to keep green.

360
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

361
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:34,284
“If I am to see you⁠—” began the girl.

362
00:23:34,284 --> 00:23:36,025
“You’re not to see me.

363
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:37,386
Not like this.

364
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:40,506
I can stay away easier than
what I am doin’.”

365
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:44,608
“Will you do me a favor, a great one?”

366
00:23:44,608 --> 00:23:46,702
said she, now.

367
00:23:46,702 --> 00:23:49,623
“Make it as impossible as you please!”

368
00:23:49,623 --> 00:23:53,196
he cried.

369
00:23:53,196 --> 00:23:55,500
He thought it was to be some action.

370
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,134
“Go on coming.

371
00:23:57,134 --> 00:24:02,586
But don’t talk to me about⁠—don’t talk in
that way⁠—if you can help it.”

372
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:05,154
He laughed out, not permitting
himself to swear.

373
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:08,479
“But,” she continued,
“if you can’t help talking that way⁠—

374
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:10,910
sometimes⁠—I promise I will listen.

375
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,876
That is the only promise I make.”

376
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:15,078
“That is a bargain,” he said.

377
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:20,124
Then he helped her mount her horse,
restraining himself like a Spartan,

378
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:22,039
and they rode home to her cabin.

379
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:24,964
“You have made it pretty near
impossible,” he said,

380
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,111
as he took his leave.

381
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:29,759
“But you’ve been square today,
and I’ll show you I can be square

382
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,759
when I come back.

383
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:33,640
I’ll not do more than ask you if
your mind’s the same.

384
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,751
And now I’ll not see you
for quite a while.

385
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:38,599
I am going a long way.

386
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,286
But I’ll be very busy.

387
00:24:40,286 --> 00:24:44,899
And bein’ busy always keeps me from
grievin’ too much about you.”

388
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:46,249
Strange is woman!

389
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:49,442
She would rather have heard some other
last remark than this.

390
00:24:49,442 --> -1:59:59,000
“Oh, very well

391
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
!”

392
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:53,486
she said.

393
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:54,836
“I’ll not miss you either.”

394
00:24:54,836 --> 00:24:56,022
He smiled at her.

395
00:24:56,022 --> 00:24:59,746
“I doubt if yu’ can help
missin’ me,” he remarked.

396
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:03,948
And he was gone at once,
galloping on his Monte horse.

397
00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:06,988
Which of the two won a victory this day?

398
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:08,148
CHAPTER XIII

399
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:10,948
The Game and the Nation⁠—Act First

400
00:25:10,948 --> 00:25:12,878
There can be no doubt of this:⁠—

401
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:18,967
All America is divided into two classes⁠—
the quality and the equality.

402
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:22,967
The latter will always recognize the
former when mistaken for it.

403
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:29,556
Both will be with us until our women
bear nothing but kings.

404
00:25:29,556 --> 00:25:33,983
It was through the Declaration of
Independence that we Americans

405
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:37,819
acknowledged the eternal
inequality of man.

406
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:42,369
For by it we abolished a
cut-and-dried aristocracy.

407
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:47,877
We had seen little men artificially held
up in high places, and great men

408
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:52,924
artificially held down in low places,
and our own justice-loving hearts

409
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:55,485
abhorred this violence to human nature.

410
00:25:55,485 --> 00:26:02,025
Therefore, we decreed that every man
should thenceforth have equal liberty to

411
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:03,705
find his own level.

412
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:10,148
By this very decree we acknowledged and
gave freedom to true aristocracy,

413
00:26:10,148 --> 00:26:14,267
saying, “Let the best man
win, whoever he is.”

414
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:15,940
Let the best man win!

415
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,173
That is America’s word.

416
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:21,082
That is true democracy.

417
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:26,391
And true democracy and true aristocracy
are one and the same thing.

418
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:31,274
If anybody cannot see this,
so much the worse for his eyesight.

419
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:34,624
The above reflections occurred to me
before reaching Billings,

420
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:39,835
Montana, some three weeks after I had
unexpectedly met the

421
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:42,755
Virginian at Omaha, Nebraska.

422
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:46,035
I had not known of that trust given to
him by Judge Henry, which

423
00:26:46,035 --> 00:26:47,386
was taking him East.

424
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:51,466
I was looking to ride with him before
long among the clean hills of Sunk

425
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:52,078
Creek.

426
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:54,106
I supposed he was there.

427
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:59,547
But I came upon him one morning in
Colonel Cyrus Jones’s eating palace.

428
00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:02,059
Did you know the palace?

429
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:07,282
It stood in Omaha, near the trains,
and it was ten years old (which is

430
00:27:07,282 --> 00:27:10,772
middle-aged in Omaha) when
I first saw it.

431
00:27:10,772 --> 00:27:14,483
It was a shell of wood,
painted with golden emblems⁠—the

432
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:18,793
steamboat, the eagle,
the Yosemite⁠—and a live bear ate

433
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:21,033
gratuities at its entrance.

434
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:27,516
Weather permitting, it opened upon the
world as a stage upon the audience.

435
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:33,296
You sat in Omaha’s whole sight and dined,
while Omaha’s dust came and

436
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:35,298
settled upon the refreshments.

437
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:40,575
It is gone the way of the Indian and the
buffalo, for the West is growing old.

438
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:44,013
You should have seen the
palace and sat there.

439
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:49,506
In front of you passed rainbows of men⁠—
Chinese, Indian chiefs,

440
00:27:49,506 --> 00:27:56,429
Africans, General Miles,
younger sons, Austrian nobility,

441
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:58,957
wide females in pink.

442
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:02,791
Our continent drained
prismatically through Omaha once.

443
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:07,591
So I was passing that way also,
walking for the sake of ventilation from

444
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:12,737
a sleeping-car toward a bath,
when the language of Colonel Cyrus Jones

445
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:13,453
came out to me.

446
00:28:13,453 --> 00:28:16,486
The actual colonel I had
never seen before.

447
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:20,682
He stood at the rear of his palace in
gray flowery mustaches and a Confederate

448
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:24,065
uniform, telling the wishes of his
guests to the cook through a hole.

449
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:28,203
You always bought meal tickets at once,
else you became unwelcome.

450
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:34,397
Guests here had foibles at times,
and a rapid exit was too easy.

451
00:28:34,397 --> 00:28:36,116
Therefore I bought a ticket.

452
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:41,043
It was spring and summer since I had
heard anything like the colonel.

453
00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:44,739
The Missouri had not yet flowed into New
York dialect freely,

454
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:48,073
and his vocabulary met me like the
breeze of the plains.

455
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:52,050
So I went in to be fanned by it,
and there sat the Virginian

456
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,376
at a table, alone.

457
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:58,385
His greeting was up to the code of
indifference proper on the plains;

458
00:28:58,385 --> 00:29:01,881
but he presently remarked,
“I’m right glad to see somebody,”

459
00:29:01,881 --> 00:29:03,340
which was a good deal to say.

460
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,132
“Them that comes hyeh,”
he observed next, “don’t eat.

461
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:08,096
They feed.”

462
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:10,994
And he considered the guests
with a sombre attention.

463
00:29:10,994 --> 00:29:14,808
“D’ yu’ reckon they find joyful digestion
in this swallo’-an’-get-out trough?”

464
00:29:14,808 --> 00:29:16,236
“What are you doing here, then?”

465
00:29:16,236 --> 00:29:16,910
said I.

466
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,255
“Oh, pshaw!

467
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:21,955
When yu’ can’t have what you choose,
yu’ just choose what you have.”

468
00:29:21,955 --> 00:29:23,438
And he took the bill-of-fare.

469
00:29:23,438 --> 00:29:26,725
I began to know that he had something on
his mind, so I did not

470
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:27,872
trouble him further.

471
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:31,567
Meanwhile he sat studying
the bill-of-fare.

472
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:33,251
“Ever heard o’ them?”

473
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:36,742
he inquired, shoving me
the spotted document.

474
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:44,078
Most improbable dishes were there⁠—
salmis, canapés, suprêmes⁠—all perfectly

475
00:29:44,078 --> 00:29:46,718
spelt and absolutely transparent.

476
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:51,599
It was the old trick of copying some
metropolitan menu to catch travellers of

477
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,330
the third and last dimension of
innocence; and whenever this is done the

478
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:00,172
food is of the third and last dimension
of awfulness, which the cowpuncher knew

479
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:01,952
as well as anybody.

480
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:05,125
“So they keep that up here still,” I said.

481
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,929
“But what about them?”

482
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:07,858
he repeated.

483
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:13,348
His finger was at a special item,
Frogs’ legs à la Delmonico.

484
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:15,586
“Are they true anywheres?”

485
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:16,341
he asked.

486
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:18,743
And I told him, certainly.

487
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:23,294
I also explained to him about Delmonico
of New York and about

488
00:30:23,294 --> 00:30:25,007
Augustin of Philadelphia.

489
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:29,855
“There’s not a little bit o’ use in lyin’
to me this mawnin’,” he said,

490
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:31,335
with his engaging smile.

491
00:30:31,335 --> -1:59:59,000
“I ain’t goin’ to awdeh anything’s laigs

492
-1:59:59,000 --> -1:59:59,000
.

493
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

494
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:38,939
“Well, I’ll see how he gets out of it,”
I said, remembering the odd Texas

495
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:39,470
legend.

496
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,299
(The traveller read the bill-of-fare,
you know, and called for a vol-au-vent.

497
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:47,939
And the proprietor looked at the
traveller, and running a pistol into his

498
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:51,615
ear, observed, “You’ll take hash.”)

499
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:55,551
I was thinking of this and wondering what
would happen to me.

500
00:30:55,551 --> 00:30:57,629
So I took the step.

501
00:30:57,629 --> 00:30:59,450
“Wants frogs’ legs, does he?”

502
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,360
shouted Colonel Cyrus Jones.

503
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,924
He fixed his eye upon me,
and it narrowed to a slit.

504
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:11,069
“Too many brain workers breakfasting
before yu’ came in, professor,” said he.

505
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,433
“Missionary ate the last leg
off me just now.

506
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:15,734
Brown the wheat!”

507
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:21,152
he commanded, through the hole to the
cook, for someone had ordered hot cakes.

508
00:31:21,152 --> 00:31:24,674
“I’ll have fried aiggs,”
said the Virginian.

509
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,381
“Cooked both sides.”

510
00:31:27,381 --> 00:31:28,981
“White wings!”

511
00:31:28,981 --> 00:31:30,705
sang the colonel through the hole.

512
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,229
“Let ’em fly up and down.”

513
00:31:32,229 --> 00:31:34,772
“Coffee an’ no milk,” said the Virginian.

514
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:36,526
“Draw one in the dark!”

515
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:38,132
the colonel roared.

516
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:41,005
“And beefsteak, rare.”

517
00:31:41,005 --> 00:31:44,776
“One slaughter in the pan,
and let the blood drip!”

518
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:49,020
“I should like a glass of
water, please,” said I.

519
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,143
The colonel threw me a look of pity.

520
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:53,569
“One Missouri and ice for the professor!”

521
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:54,580
he said.

522
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,468
“That fello’s a right live
man,” commented the Virginian.

523
00:31:57,468 --> 00:32:00,374
But he seemed thoughtful.

524
00:32:00,374 --> 00:32:03,602
Presently he inquired,
“Yu’ say he was a foreigner,

525
00:32:03,602 --> 00:32:06,597
an’ learned fancy cookin’ to New Yawk?”

526
00:32:06,597 --> 00:32:08,465
That was this cowpuncher’s way.

527
00:32:08,465 --> 00:32:13,500
Scarcely ever would he let drop a thing
new to him until he had got from you

528
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,250
your whole information about it.

529
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:22,072
So I told him the history of Lorenzo
Delmonico and his pioneer work,

530
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:25,612
as much as I knew, and
the Southerner listened intently.

531
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:29,012
“Mighty inter-estin’,” he said⁠—“mighty.

532
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:32,663
He could just take little old o’rn’ry
frawgs, and dandy ’em up

533
00:32:32,663 --> 00:32:34,024
to suit the bloods.

534
00:32:34,024 --> -1:59:59,000
Mighty inter

535
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
-

536
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,675
estin’.

537
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:39,837
I expaict, though, his cookin’ would give
an outraiged stomach to

538
00:32:39,837 --> 00:32:41,049
a plain-raised man.”

539
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:45,350
“If you want to follow it up,”
said I, by way of a sudden experiment,

540
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,051
“Miss Molly Wood might have some
book about French dishes.”

541
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:52,900
But the Virginian did not turn a hair.

542
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,624
“I reckon she wouldn’t,” he answered.

543
00:32:55,624 --> 00:32:58,095
“She was raised in Vermont.

544
00:32:58,095 --> 00:33:01,550
They don’t bother overly about their
eatin’ up in Vermont.

545
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:05,257
Hyeh’s what Miss Wood recommended the
las’ time I was seein’ her,”

546
00:33:05,257 --> 00:33:08,822
the cowpuncher added,
bringing Kenilworth from his pocket.

547
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:10,822
“Right fine story.

548
00:33:10,822 --> -1:59:59,000
That Queen Elizabeth must have cert’nly
been a competent woman.

549
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

550
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:19,970
“She was,” said I.

551
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,198
But talk came to an end here.

552
00:33:22,198 --> 00:33:28,524
A dusty crew, most evidently from the
plains, now entered and drifted to a

553
00:33:28,524 --> 00:33:32,203
table; and each man of them gave the
Virginian about a quarter

554
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:33,674
of a slouchy nod.

555
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:35,958
His greeting to them was very serene.

556
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:45,677
Only, Kenilworthwent back into his
pocket, and he breakfasted in silence.

557
00:33:45,677 --> 00:33:50,414
Among those who had greeted him I
now recognized a face.

558
00:33:50,414 --> 00:33:54,339
“Why, that’s the man you played cards
with at Medicine Bow!”

559
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:54,957
I said.

560
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:55,979
“Yes.

561
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:57,350
Trampas.

562
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,084
He’s got a job at the ranch now.”

563
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:03,494
The Virginian said no more,
but went on with his breakfast.

564
00:34:03,494 --> 00:34:05,595
His appearance was changed.

565
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:09,515
Aged I would scarcely say,
for this would seem as if he

566
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:10,684
did not look young.

567
00:34:10,684 --> 00:34:14,884
But I think that the boy was altogether
gone from his face⁠—the boy whose freak

568
00:34:14,884 --> 00:34:19,787
with Steve had turned Medicine Bow
upside down, whose other freak with the

569
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:23,667
babies had outraged Bear Creek,
the boy who had loved

570
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:26,348
to jingle his spurs.

571
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:30,983
But manhood had only trained,
not broken, his youth.

572
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:35,185
It was all there, only obedient to
the rein and curb.

573
00:34:35,185 --> 00:34:38,632
Presently we went together
to the railway yard.

574
00:34:38,632 --> 00:34:41,740
“The Judge is doing a right smart o’
business this year,”

575
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:46,209
he began, very casually indeed,
so that I knew this was important.

576
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:51,727
Besides bells and coal smoke,
the smell and crowded sounds of cattle

577
00:34:51,727 --> 00:34:54,139
rose in the air around us.

578
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:59,145
“Hyeh’s our first gather o’ beeves on the
ranch,” continued the Virginian.

579
00:34:59,145 --> 00:35:03,352
“The whole lot’s shipped through to
Chicago in two sections

580
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:04,703
over the Burlington.

581
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,681
The Judge is fighting the Elkhorn road.”

582
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:11,755
We passed slowly along the two trains⁠—
twenty cars, each car packed with

583
00:35:11,755 --> 00:35:14,355
huddled, round-eyed, gazing steers.

584
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:16,751
He examined to see if
any animals were down.

585
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:21,277
“They ain’t ate or drank anything to
speak of,” he said, while the terrified

586
00:35:21,277 --> 00:35:23,586
brutes stared at us through their slats.

587
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:27,673
“Not since they struck the
railroad they’ve not drank.

588
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:32,619
Yu’ might suppose they know somehow what
they’re travellin’ to Chicago for.”

589
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:36,374
And casually, always casually,
he told me the rest.

590
00:35:36,374 --> 00:35:42,500
Judge Henry could not spare his foreman
away from the second gather of beeves.

591
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,718
Therefore these two ten-car trains with
their double crew of cowboys had been

592
00:35:47,718 --> 00:35:49,908
given to the Virginian’s charge.

593
00:35:49,908 --> 00:35:54,082
After Chicago, he was to return by St.

594
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:56,965
Paul over the Northern Pacific;
for the Judge had wished him to see

595
00:35:56,965 --> 00:36:02,050
certain of the road’s directors and
explain to them persuasively how good a

596
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:07,633
thing it would be for them to allow
especially cheap rates to the

597
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:10,393
Sunk Creek outfit henceforth.

598
00:36:10,393 --> 00:36:13,735
This was all the Virginian told me;
and it contained the whole

599
00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:15,852
matter, to be sure.

600
00:36:15,852 --> 00:36:18,340
“So you’re acting foreman,” said I.

601
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,621
“Why, somebody has to have
the say, I reckon.”

602
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:24,660
“And of course you hated the promotion?”

603
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,975
“I don’t know about promotion,”
he replied.

604
00:36:27,975 --> 00:36:31,001
“The boys have been used to seein’
me one of themselves.

605
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:33,531
Why don’t you come along with
us far as Plattsmouth?”

606
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:37,786
Thus he shifted the subject from himself,
and called to my notice the locomotives

607
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:43,324
backing up to his cars,
and reminded me that from Plattsmouth I

608
00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:45,604
had the choice of two trains returning.

609
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:51,088
But he could not hide or belittle this
confidence of his employer in him.

610
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:54,624
It was the care of several thousand
perishable dollars and

611
00:36:54,624 --> 00:36:55,923
the control of men.

612
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,487
It was a compliment.

613
00:36:57,487 --> 00:37:01,847
There were more steers than men to be
responsible for; but none of the steers

614
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:06,405
had been suddenly picked from the herd
and set above his fellows.

615
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:11,899
Moreover, Chicago finished up the steers;
but the new-made deputy foreman had then

616
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:17,571
to lead his six highly unoccupied
brethren away from towns,

617
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:21,670
and back in peace to the ranch,
or disappoint the Judge,

618
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,566
who needed their services.

619
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:28,049
These things sometimes go wrong in a land
where they say you are all born equal;

620
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:32,125
and that quarter of a nod in Colonel
Cyrus Jones’s eating palace held more

621
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,162
equality than any whole
nod you could see.

622
00:37:35,162 --> 00:37:39,441
But the Virginian did not see it,
there being a time for all things.

623
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:43,048
We trundled down the flopping,
heavy-eddied Missouri to Plattsmouth,

624
00:37:43,048 --> 00:37:46,999
and there they backed us on to a siding,
the Christian Endeavor being expected

625
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:48,145
to pass that way.

626
00:37:48,145 --> 00:37:53,203
And while the equality absorbed
themselves in a deep but harmless game

627
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:57,995
of poker by the side of the railway
line, the Virginian and I sat on the top

628
00:37:57,995 --> 00:38:01,716
of a car, contemplating the sandy
shallows of the Platte.

629
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:05,032
“I should think you’d take
a hand,” said I.

630
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,107
“Poker?

631
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:07,896
With them kittens?”

632
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:12,343
One flash of the inner man lightened in
his eyes and died away,

633
00:38:12,343 --> 00:38:15,785
and he finished with his gentle drawl,
“When I play, I want

634
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:16,833
it to be interestin’.”

635
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:23,299
He took out Sir Walter’s Kenilworth once
more, and turned the volume over and

636
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:26,023
over slowly, without opening it.

637
00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:31,808
You cannot tell if in spirit he wandered
on Bear Creek with the girl

638
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:33,120
whose book it was.

639
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,426
The spirit will go one road,
and the thought another,

640
00:38:37,426 --> 00:38:41,160
and the body its own way sometimes.

641
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,619
“Queen Elizabeth would have played a
mighty pow’ful game,”

642
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:47,145
was his next remark.

643
00:38:47,145 --> 00:38:47,819
“Poker?”

644
00:38:47,819 --> -1:59:59,000
said I.

645
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
“

646
00:38:48,555 --> 00:38:50,839
Yes, seh.

647
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:54,619
Do you expaict Europe has got any queen
equal to her at present?”

648
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:55,516
I doubted it.

649
00:38:55,516 --> 00:39:00,221
“Victoria’d get pretty nigh slain sliding
chips out agaynst Elizabeth.

650
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:05,018
Only mos’ prob’ly Victoria she’d insist
on a half-cent limit.

651
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:08,137
You have read this hyeh Kenilworth?

652
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:13,605
Well, deal Elizabeth ace high,
an’ she could scare Robert Dudley with a

653
00:39:13,605 --> 00:39:16,061
full house plumb out o’ the bettin’.”

654
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:19,806
I said that I believed
she unquestionably could.

655
00:39:19,806 --> 00:39:24,791
“And,” said the Virginian,
“if Essex’s play got next her too near,

656
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:27,234
I reckon she’d have stacked the cyards.

657
00:39:27,234 --> -1:59:59,000
Say, d’ yu’ remember Shakespeare’s
fat man?

658
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

659
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:31,394
“Falstaff?

660
00:39:31,394 --> 00:39:33,274
Oh, yes, indeed.”

661
00:39:33,274 --> 00:39:35,451
“Ain’t that grand?

662
00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:39,128
Why, he makes men talk the way
they do in life.

663
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:41,300
I reckon he couldn’t get printed today.

664
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,712
It’s a right down shame Shakespeare
couldn’t know about poker.

665
00:39:44,712 --> 00:39:49,449
He’d have had Falstaff playing all day
at that Tearsheet outfit.

666
00:39:49,449 --> -1:59:59,000
And the Prince would have beat him.

667
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

668
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:56,866
“The Prince had the brains,” said I.

669
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:58,403
“Brains?”

670
00:39:58,403 --> 00:39:59,382
“Well, didn’t he?”

671
00:39:59,382 --> 00:40:01,053
“I neveh thought to notice.

672
00:40:01,053 --> 00:40:02,443
Like as not he did.”

673
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:04,483
“And Falstaff didn’t, I suppose?”

674
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:05,432
“Oh, yes, seh!

675
00:40:05,432 --> 00:40:06,988
Falstaff could have played whist.”

676
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:11,363
“I suppose you know what you’re talking
about; I don’t,” said I,

677
00:40:11,363 --> 00:40:12,643
for he was drawling again.

678
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:16,900
The cowpuncher’s eye rested a
moment amiably upon me.

679
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:23,445
“You can play whist with your brains,”
he mused⁠—“brains and cyards.

680
00:40:23,445 --> 00:40:26,725
Now cyards are only one o’ the
manifestations of poker

681
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,229
in this hyeh world.

682
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:33,611
One o’ the shapes yu fool with it in when
the day’s work is oveh.

683
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:38,216
If a man is built like that Prince boy
was built (and it’s away down deep

684
00:40:38,216 --> 00:40:42,732
beyond brains), he’ll play winnin’ poker
with whatever hand he’s holdin’

685
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,414
when the trouble begins.

686
00:40:44,414 --> 00:40:49,278
Maybe it will be a mean,
triflin’ army, or an empty six-shooter,

687
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:54,882
or a lame hawss, or maybe just nothin’
but his natural countenance.

688
00:40:54,882 --> 00:40:59,117
’Most any old thing will do for a fello’
like that Prince boy to play poker

689
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:00,237
with.”

690
00:41:00,237 --> 00:41:05,580
“Then I’d be grateful for your definition
of poker,” said I.

691
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,613
Again the Virginian looked
me over amiably.

692
00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:13,741
“You put up a mighty pretty game o’
whist yourself,” he remarked.

693
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:16,000
“Don’t that give you the
contented spirit?”

694
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,457
And before I had any reply to this,
the Christian Endeavor began to

695
00:41:20,457 --> 00:41:21,747
come over the bridge.

696
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:25,297
Three instalments crossed the Missouri
from Pacific Junction,

697
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:29,771
bound for Pike’s Peak,
every car swathed in bright bunting,

698
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:35,813
and at each window a Christian with
a handkerchief, joyously shrieking.

699
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:40,508
Then the cattle trains got the open
signal, and I jumped off.

700
00:41:40,508 --> 00:41:45,423
“Tell the Judge the steers was all right
this far,” said the Virginian.

701
00:41:45,423 --> 00:41:48,278
That was the last of the deputy
foreman for a while.

702
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:49,428
CHAPTER XIV

703
00:41:49,428 --> 00:41:51,212
Between the Acts

704
00:41:51,212 --> 00:41:54,934
My road to Sunk Creek lay
in no straight line.

705
00:41:54,934 --> 00:41:59,409
By rail I diverged northwest to
Fort Meade, and thence

706
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:04,626
, after some stay with the kind military
people, I made my way on a horse.

707
00:42:04,626 --> 00:42:11,195
Up here in the Black Hills it
sluiced rain most intolerably.

708
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:15,022
The horse and I enjoyed the country and
ourselves but little;

709
00:42:15,022 --> 00:42:19,368
and when finally I changed from the
saddle into a stagecoach,

710
00:42:19,368 --> 00:42:24,299
I caught a thankful expression upon the
animal’s face, and returned the same.

711
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:28,095
“Six legs inside this jerky tonight?”

712
00:42:28,095 --> 00:42:30,574
said somebody, as I climbed the wheel.

713
00:42:30,574 --> 00:42:33,850
“Well, we’ll give thanks for not havin’
eight,” he added cheerfully.

714
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,311
“Clamp your mind on to that, Shorty.”

715
00:42:36,311 --> 00:42:38,275
And he slapped the shoulder
of his neighbor.

716
00:42:38,275 --> 00:42:41,634
Naturally I took these
two for old companions.

717
00:42:41,634 --> 00:42:44,023
But we were all total strangers.

718
00:42:44,023 --> 00:42:48,783
They told me of the new gold excitement
at Rawhide, and supposed it would bring

719
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:52,863
up the Northern Pacific;
and when I explained the millions owed

720
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:57,504
to this road’s German bondholders,
they were of opinion that a German would

721
00:42:57,504 --> 00:42:59,568
strike it richer at Rawhide.

722
00:42:59,568 --> 00:43:03,334
We spoke of all sorts of things,
and in our silence I gloated on the

723
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:07,029
autumn holiday promised
me by Judge Henry.

724
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:10,468
His last letter had said that an outfit
would be starting for his ranch from

725
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:13,415
Billings on the seventh,
and he would have a horse for me.

726
00:43:13,415 --> 00:43:14,765
This was the fifth.

727
00:43:14,765 --> 00:43:19,405
So we six legs in the jerky travelled
harmoniously on over the rain-gutted

728
00:43:19,405 --> 00:43:22,806
road, getting no deeper knowledge of
each other than what

729
00:43:22,806 --> 00:43:25,207
our outsides might imply.

730
00:43:25,207 --> 00:43:27,993
Not that we concealed anything.

731
00:43:27,993 --> 00:43:33,078
The man who had slapped
Shorty introduced himself early.

732
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:35,546
“Scipio le Moyne, from
Gallipolice, Ohio,” he said.

733
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,318
“The eldest of us always
gets called Scipio.

734
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:39,224
It’s French.

735
00:43:39,224 --> 00:43:42,170
But us folks have been white
for a hundred years.”

736
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:47,671
He was limber and light-muscled,
and fell skilfully about,

737
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:51,803
evading bruises when the jerky reeled
or rose on end.

738
00:43:51,803 --> 00:43:57,400
He had a strange, long,
jocular nose, very wary-looking,

739
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,205
and a bleached blue eye.

740
00:43:59,205 --> 00:44:03,093
Cattle was his business,
as a rule, but of late he had been

741
00:44:03,093 --> 00:44:06,607
“looking around some,”
and Rawhide seemed much on his brain.

742
00:44:06,607 --> 00:44:10,783
Shorty struck me as “looking around” also.

743
00:44:10,783 --> 00:44:14,337
He was quite short, indeed,
and the jerky hurt him almost every

744
00:44:14,337 --> 00:44:15,297
time.

745
00:44:15,297 --> 00:44:18,161
He was light-haired and mild.

746
00:44:18,161 --> 00:44:23,673
Think of a yellow dog that is lost,
and fancies each newcomer in sight is

747
00:44:23,673 --> 00:44:27,753
going to turn out his master,
and you will have Shorty.

748
00:44:27,753 --> 00:44:32,557
It was the Northern Pacific that
surprised us into intimacy.

749
00:44:32,557 --> 00:44:33,917
We were nearing Medora.

750
00:44:33,917 --> 00:44:37,439
We had made a last arrangement
of our legs.

751
00:44:37,439 --> 00:44:41,051
I lay stretched in silence,
placid in the knowledge it

752
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:42,416
was soon to end.

753
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,677
So I drowsed.

754
00:44:44,677 --> 00:44:49,402
I felt something sudden,
and, waking, saw Scipio

755
00:44:49,402 --> 00:44:51,287
passing through the air.

756
00:44:51,287 --> 00:44:55,690
As Shorty next shot from the jerky,
I beheld smoke and the locomotive.

757
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:58,704
The Northern Pacific had
changed its schedule.

758
00:44:58,704 --> 00:45:03,335
A valise is a poor companion for
catching a train with.

759
00:45:03,335 --> 00:45:09,503
There was rutted sand and lumpy,
knee-high grease wood in our shortcut.

760
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:15,614
A piece of stray wire sprang from some
hole and hung caracoling about my ankle.

761
00:45:15,614 --> 00:45:17,886
Tin cans spun from my stride.

762
00:45:17,886 --> 00:45:23,768
But we made a conspicuous race.

763
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:28,461
Two of us waved hats,
and there was no moment that some one of

764
00:45:28,461 --> 00:45:29,902
us was not screeching.

765
00:45:29,902 --> 00:45:33,610
It meant twenty-four hours to us.

766
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:36,688
Perhaps we failed to catch the train’s
attention, though the

767
00:45:36,688 --> 00:45:39,741
theory seems monstrous.

768
00:45:39,741 --> 00:45:44,337
As it moved off in our faces,
smooth and easy and insulting,

769
00:45:44,337 --> 00:45:48,824
Scipio dropped instantly to a walk,
and we two others outstripped him and

770
00:45:48,824 --> 00:45:50,762
came desperately to the empty track.

771
00:45:50,762 --> 00:45:52,190
There went the train.

772
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:57,831
Even still its puffs were the separated
puffs of starting, that bitten-off,

773
00:45:57,831 --> 00:46:04,484
snorty kind, and sweat and our true
natures broke freely forth.

774
00:46:04,484 --> 00:46:08,563
I kicked my valise, and then
sat on it, dumb.

775
00:46:08,563 --> 00:46:11,525
Shorty yielded himself up aloud.

776
00:46:11,525 --> 00:46:13,600
All his humble secrets came out of him.

777
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,725
He walked aimlessly round, lamenting.

778
00:46:16,725 --> 00:46:19,644
He had lost his job, and
he mentioned the ranch.

779
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:22,401
He had played cards, and
he mentioned the man.

780
00:46:22,401 --> 00:46:25,857
He had sold his horse and saddle to catch
a friend on this train,

781
00:46:25,857 --> 00:46:28,396
and he mentioned what the friend had
been going to do for him.

782
00:46:28,396 --> 00:46:33,169
He told a string of griefs and names to
the air, as if the air knew.

783
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:37,893
Meanwhile Scipio arrived with extreme
leisure at the rails.

784
00:46:37,893 --> 00:46:42,872
He stuck his hands into his pockets and
his head out at the very small train.

785
00:46:42,872 --> 00:46:49,674
His bleached blue eyes shut to slits as
he watched the rear car in its smoke-

786
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:55,823
blur ooze away westward
among the mounded bluffs.

787
00:46:55,823 --> 00:46:58,109
“Lucky it’s out of range,” I thought.

788
00:46:58,109 --> 00:47:00,861
But now Scipio spoke to it.

789
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:05,869
“Why, you seem to think you’ve left me
behind,” he began easily,

790
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:07,328
in fawning tones.

791
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:10,947
“You’re too much of a kid
to have such thoughts.

792
00:47:10,947 --> 00:47:11,865
Age some.”

793
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:14,941
His next remark grew less wheedling.

794
00:47:14,941 --> 00:47:17,190
“I wouldn’t be a bit proud to meet yu’.

795
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:22,722
Why, if I was seen travellin’ with yu’,
I’d have to explain it to my friends!

796
00:47:22,722 --> 00:47:24,288
Think you’ve got me left, do yu’?

797
00:47:24,288 --> 00:47:28,931
Just because yu’ ride through this
country on a rail, do yu’ claim yu’ can

798
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:30,531
find your way around?

799
00:47:30,531 --> 00:47:35,046
I could take yu’ out ten yards in the
brush and lose yu’ in ten seconds,

800
00:47:35,046 --> 00:47:35,206
you spangle-roofed hobo!

801
00:47:35,206 --> 00:47:35,615
Leave me behind?

802
00:47:35,615 --> 00:47:39,239
you recent blanket-mortgage yearlin’!

803
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:43,363
You plush-lined, nickel-plated,
whistlin’ wash room,

804
00:47:43,363 --> 00:47:47,586
d’ yu’ figure I can’t go east just
as soon as west?

805
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:51,840
Or I’ll stay right here if it suits me,
yu’ dude-inhabited hotbox!

806
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,849
Why, yu’ coon-bossed face-towel⁠—”

807
00:47:54,849 --> 00:48:00,007
But from here he rose in flights of
novelty that appalled and held me

808
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:02,660
spellbound, and which are not for me
to say to you.

809
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,207
Then he came down easily again,
and finished with expressions of

810
00:48:06,207 --> 00:48:09,527
sympathy for it because it could never
have known a mother.

811
00:48:09,527 --> 00:48:13,471
“Do you expaict it could show
a male parent offhand?”

812
00:48:13,471 --> 00:48:15,910
inquired a slow voice behind us.

813
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:19,853
I jumped round, and there
was the Virginian.

814
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:21,184
“Male parent!”

815
00:48:21,184 --> 00:48:22,944
scoffed the prompt Scipio.

816
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:24,744
“Ain’t you heard about them yet?”

817
00:48:24,744 --> 00:48:25,425
“Them?

818
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:27,027
Was there two?”

819
00:48:27,027 --> 00:48:28,133
“Two?

820
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:32,055
The blamed thing was sired by a
whole doggone Dutch syndicate.”

821
00:48:32,055 --> 00:48:35,037
“Why, the piebald son of a gun!”

822
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,759
responded the Virginian, sweetly.

823
00:48:36,759 --> 00:48:40,172
“I got them steers through all right,”
he added to me.

824
00:48:40,172 --> 00:48:43,259
“Sorry to see yu’ get so out o’
breath afteh the train.

825
00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:45,170
Is your valise sufferin’ any?”

826
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:45,994
“Who’s he?”

827
00:48:45,994 --> 00:48:49,033
inquired Scipio, curiously, turning to me.

828
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:53,645
The Southerner sat with a newspaper on
the rear platform of a caboose.

829
00:48:53,645 --> 00:48:57,674
The caboose stood hitched behind a mile
or so of freight train,

830
00:48:57,674 --> 00:48:59,666
and the train was headed west.

831
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:04,239
So here was the deputy foreman,
his steers delivered in Chicago,

832
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:10,091
his men (I could hear them) safe in the
caboose, his paper in his lap,

833
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:15,364
and his legs dangling at
ease over the railing.

834
00:49:15,364 --> 00:49:22,066
He wore the look of a man for whom
things are going smooth.

835
00:49:22,066 --> 00:49:26,172
And for me the way to Billings
was smooth now, also.

836
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,257
“Who’s he?”

837
00:49:27,257 --> 00:49:29,084
Scipio repeated.

838
00:49:29,084 --> 00:49:36,106
But from inside the caboose loud laughter
and noise broke on us.

839
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,677
Someone was reciting “And it’s
my night to howl.”

840
00:49:38,677 --> 00:49:44,895
“We’ll all howl when we get to Rawhide,”
said some other one; and they howled

841
00:49:44,895 --> 00:49:46,135
now.

842
00:49:46,135 --> 00:49:50,710
“These hyeh steam cyars,”
said the Virginian to Scipio,

843
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:54,320
“make a man’s language mighty nigh as
speedy as his travel.”

844
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:59,262
Of Shorty he took no notice whatever⁠—no
more than of the manifestations

845
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:00,684
in the caboose.

846
00:50:00,684 --> 00:50:04,601
“So yu’ heard me speakin’ to
the express,” said Scipio.

847
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:10,812
“Well, I guess, sometimes I⁠—See here,”
he exclaimed, for the Virginian was

848
00:50:10,812 --> 00:50:14,227
gravely considering him,
“I may have talked some,

849
00:50:14,227 --> 00:50:16,110
but I walked a whole lot.

850
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:19,220
You didn’t catch me squandering no speed.

851
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,560
Soon as⁠—”

852
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,776
“I noticed,” said the Virginian,
“thinkin’ came quicker

853
00:50:24,776 --> 00:50:26,391
to yu’ than runnin’.”

854
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:30,139
I was glad I was not Shorty,
to have my measure taken merely by my

855
00:50:30,139 --> 00:50:31,482
way of missing a train.

856
00:50:31,482 --> 00:50:35,401
And of course I was sorry that I
had kicked my valise.

857
00:50:35,401 --> 00:50:38,113
“Oh, I could tell yu’d been enjoyin’ us!”

858
00:50:38,113 --> 00:50:39,008
said Scipio.

859
00:50:39,008 --> 00:50:42,907
“Observin’ somebody else’s scrape always
kind o’ rests me too.

860
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:45,254
Maybe you’re a philosopher,
but maybe there’s a pair of us

861
00:50:45,254 --> -1:59:59,000
drawd in this deal.

862
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

863
00:50:46,574 --> 00:50:50,654
Approval now grew plain upon the
face of the Virginian.

864
00:50:50,654 --> 00:50:54,635
“By your laigs,” said he,
“you are used to the saddle.”

865
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,126
“I’d be called used to it, I expect.”

866
00:50:57,126 --> 00:51:02,707
“By your hands,” said the Southerner,
again, “you ain’t roped

867
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:04,530
many steers lately.

868
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,940
Been cookin’ or something?”

869
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,230
“Say,” retorted Scipio,
“tell my future some now.

870
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,710
Draw a conclusion from my mouth.”

871
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:16,000
“I’m right distressed,”
answered the gentle Southerner,

872
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,721
“we’ve not a drop in the outfit.”

873
00:51:18,721 --> 00:51:21,785
“Oh, drink with me uptown!”

874
00:51:21,785 --> 00:51:22,735
cried Scipio.

875
00:51:22,735 --> 00:51:24,142
“I’m pleased to death with yu’.”

876
00:51:24,142 --> 00:51:27,736
The Virginian glanced where the saloons
stood just behind the station,

877
00:51:27,736 --> 00:51:28,585
and shook his head.

878
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,595
“Why, it ain’t a bit far
to whiskey from here!”

879
00:51:31,595 --> 00:51:33,877
urged the other, plaintively.

880
00:51:33,877 --> 00:51:36,470
“Step down, now.

881
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,801
Scipio le Moyne’s my name.

882
00:51:38,801 --> 00:51:42,855
Yes, you’re lookin’ for my brass earrings.

883
00:51:42,855 --> 00:51:46,391
But there ain’t no earrings on me.

884
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:49,604
I’ve been white for a hundred years.

885
00:51:49,604 --> 00:51:50,740
Step down.

886
00:51:50,740 --> -1:59:59,000
I’ve a forty-dollar thirst.

887
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

888
00:51:52,259 --> 00:51:55,237
“You’re certainly white,”
began the Virginian.

889
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:55,792
“But⁠—”

890
00:51:55,792 --> 00:51:57,560
Here the caboose resumed:⁠—

891
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,222
“I’m wild, and woolly,
and full of peas;I’m hard to curry above

892
00:52:01,222 --> 00:52:10,235
the knees;I’m a she-wolf from Bitter
Creek, andIt’s my night to ho‑o‑wl⁠—”

893
00:52:10,235 --> 00:52:15,331
And as they howled and stamped,
the wheels of the caboose began to turn

894
00:52:15,331 --> 00:52:17,325
gently and to murmur.

895
00:52:17,325 --> 00:52:19,296
The Virginian rose suddenly.

896
00:52:19,296 --> 00:52:24,385
“Will yu’ save that thirst and take
a forty-dollar job?”

897
00:52:24,385 --> 00:52:27,345
“Missin’ trains, profanity, or what?”

898
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:28,295
said Scipio.

899
00:52:28,295 --> 00:52:30,335
“I’ll tell yu’ soon as I’m sure.”

900
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,775
At this Scipio looked
hard at the Virginian.

901
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:36,000
“Why, you’re talkin’ business!”

902
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,508
said he, and leaped on the caboose,
where I was already.

903
00:52:40,508 --> 00:52:44,917
“I was thinkin’ of Rawhide,”
he added, “but I ain’t any more.”

904
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:46,922
“Well, good luck!”

905
00:52:46,922 --> 00:52:49,723
said Shorty, on the track behind us.

906
00:52:49,723 --> 00:52:51,018
“Oh, say!”

907
00:52:51,018 --> 00:52:55,750
said Scipio, “he wanted to go on that
train, just like me.”

908
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,290
“Get on,” called the Virginian.

909
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:01,640
“But as to getting a job,
he ain’t just like you.”

910
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,850
So Shorty came, like a lost dog when
you whistle to him.

911
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,852
Our wheels clucked over
the mainline switch.

912
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,984
A train-hand threw it shut after us,
jumped aboard, and returned

913
00:53:12,984 --> 00:53:14,815
forward over the roofs.

914
00:53:14,815 --> 00:53:19,196
Inside the caboose they had reached the
third howling of the she-wolf.

915
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,214
“Friends of yourn?”

916
00:53:20,214 --> 00:53:21,255
said Scipio.

917
00:53:21,255 --> 00:53:24,403
“My outfit,” drawled the Virginian.

918
00:53:24,403 --> 00:53:26,190
“Do yu’ always travel outside?”

919
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,540
inquired Scipio.

920
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,870
“It’s lonesome in there,”
returned the deputy foreman.

921
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:34,444
And here one of them came
out, slamming the door.

922
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:35,114
“Hell!”

923
00:53:35,114 --> 00:53:37,766
he said, at sight of the distant town.

924
00:53:37,766 --> 00:53:42,033
Then, truculently, to the Virginian,
“I told you I was going to

925
00:53:42,033 --> 00:53:43,623
get a bottle here.”

926
00:53:43,623 --> 00:53:46,692
“Have your bottle, then,”
said the deputy foreman,

927
00:53:46,692 --> 00:53:48,408
and kicked him off into Dakota.

928
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:51,562
(It was not North Dakota yet;
they had not divided it.)

929
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:57,141
The Virginian had aimed his pistol at
about the same time with his boot.

930
00:53:57,141 --> 00:54:03,009
Therefore the man sat in Dakota quietly,
watching us go away into Montana,

931
00:54:03,009 --> 00:54:05,469
and offering no objections.

932
00:54:05,469 --> 00:54:11,241
Just before he became too small to make
out, we saw him rise and remove himself

933
00:54:11,241 --> 00:54:13,390
back toward the saloons.

934
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:14,390
CHAPTER XV

935
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:17,379
The Game and the Nation⁠—Act Second

936
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:22,964
“That is the only step I have had to take
this whole trip,” said the Virginian.

937
00:54:22,964 --> 00:54:25,195
He holstered his pistol with a jerk.

938
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:28,179
“I have been fearing he would
force it on me.”

939
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:31,796
And he looked at empty,
receding Dakota with disgust.

940
00:54:31,796 --> 00:54:34,175
“So nyeh back home!”

941
00:54:34,175 --> 00:54:35,391
he muttered.

942
00:54:35,391 --> 00:54:37,001
“Known your friend long?”

943
00:54:37,001 --> 00:54:38,515
whispered Scipio to me.

944
00:54:38,515 --> 00:54:40,111
“Fairly,” I answered.

945
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:45,138
Scipio’s bleached eyes brightened with
admiration as he considered

946
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:46,303
the Southerner’s back.

947
00:54:46,303 --> 00:54:51,068
“Well,” he stated judicially,
“start awful early when yu’ go to fool

948
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:54,039
with him, or he’ll make
you feel unpunctual.”

949
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:58,901
“I expaict I’ve had them almost all of
three thousand miles,”

950
00:54:58,901 --> 00:55:04,114
said the Virginian, tilting his head
toward the noise in the caboose.

951
00:55:04,114 --> 00:55:07,701
“And I’ve strove to deliver them back
as I received them.

952
00:55:07,701 --> 00:55:08,895
The whole lot.

953
00:55:08,895 --> 00:55:10,625
And I would have.

954
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:12,584
But he has spoiled my hopes.”

955
00:55:12,584 --> 00:55:15,676
The deputy foreman looked again at Dakota.

956
00:55:15,676 --> 00:55:17,637
“It’s a disappointment,” he added.

957
00:55:17,637 --> 00:55:19,575
“You may know what I mean.”

958
00:55:19,575 --> 00:55:22,989
I had known a little,
but not to the very deep,

959
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:28,882
of the man’s pride and
purpose in this trust.

960
00:55:28,882 --> 00:55:30,961
Scipio gave him sympathy.

961
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:33,932
“There must be quite a balance of ’em
left with yu’ yet,” said

962
00:55:33,932 --> 00:55:35,092
Scipio, cheeringly.

963
00:55:35,092 --> 00:55:39,524
“I had the boys plumb contented,”
pursued the deputy foreman,

964
00:55:39,524 --> 00:55:42,016
hurt into open talk of himself.

965
00:55:42,016 --> 00:55:48,044
“Away along as far as Saynt Paul I had
them reconciled to my authority.

966
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,176
Then this news about gold
had to strike us.”

967
00:55:50,176 --> 00:55:54,738
“And they’re a-dreamin’ nuggets and
Parisian bowleyvards,” suggested Scipio.

968
00:55:54,738 --> 00:55:58,232
The Virginian smiled gratefully at him.

969
00:55:58,232 --> 00:56:04,967
“Fortune is shinin’ bright and blindin’
to their delicate young eyes,”

970
00:56:04,967 --> 00:56:07,413
he said, regaining his usual self.

971
00:56:07,413 --> 00:56:10,407
We all listened a moment
to the rejoicings within.

972
00:56:10,407 --> 00:56:12,218
“Energetic, ain’t they?”

973
00:56:12,218 --> 00:56:13,304
said the Southerner.

974
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:18,332
“But none of ’em was whelped savage
enough to sing himself bloodthirsty.

975
00:56:18,332 --> 00:56:21,192
And though they’re strainin’ mighty
earnest not to be tame,

976
00:56:21,192 --> -1:59:59,000
they’re goin’ back to Sunk Creek with me
accordin’ to the Judge’s awders

977
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

978
00:56:24,951 --> 00:56:29,262
Never a calf of them will desert to
Rawhide, for all their dangerousness;

979
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:32,302
nor I ain’t goin’ to have
any fuss over it.

980
00:56:32,302 --> 00:56:36,779
Only one is left now that don’t sing.

981
00:56:36,779 --> 00:56:39,495
Maybe I will have to make
some arrangements about him.

982
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:44,042
The man I have parted with,”
he said, with another glance

983
00:56:44,042 --> 00:56:44,251
at

984
00:56:44,251 --> 00:56:44,934
Dakota

985
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:49,262
, “was our cook, and I will ask yu’
to replace him, Colonel.”

986
00:56:49,262 --> 00:56:51,065
Scipio gaped wide.

987
00:56:51,065 --> 00:56:52,140
“Colonel!

988
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:52,991
Say!”

989
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,822
He stared at the Virginian.

990
00:56:54,822 --> 00:56:56,942
“Did I meet yu’ at the palace?”

991
00:56:56,942 --> 00:57:00,161
“Not exackly meet,” replied
the Southerner.

992
00:57:00,161 --> 00:57:03,792
“I was present one mawnin’ las’ month
when this gentleman awdehed

993
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:05,314
frawgs’ laigs.”

994
00:57:05,314 --> 00:57:09,028
“Sakes and saints, but that
was a mean position!”

995
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:10,657
burst out Scipio.

996
00:57:10,657 --> 00:57:13,530
“I had to tell all comers
anything all day.

997
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,348
Stand up and jump language hot off
my brain at ’em.

998
00:57:17,348 --> 00:57:22,481
And the pay don’t near compensate for the
drain on the system.

999
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:26,934
I don’t care how good a man is,
you let him keep a-tappin’ his presence

1000
00:57:26,934 --> 00:57:29,459
of mind right along,
without takin’ a layoff,

1001
00:57:29,459 --> 00:57:30,836
and you’ll have him sick.

1002
00:57:30,836 --> 00:57:31,654
Yes, sir.

1003
00:57:31,654 --> 00:57:33,296
You’ll hit his nerves.

1004
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:38,674
So I told them they could hire some fresh
man, for I was goin’ back to punch

1005
00:57:38,674 --> 00:57:42,510
cattle or fight Indians,
or take a rest somehow,

1006
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:47,221
for I didn’t propose to get jaded,
and me only twenty-five years old.

1007
00:57:47,221 --> 00:57:50,635
There ain’t no regular Colonel Cyrus
Jones any more, yu’ know.

1008
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:55,559
He met a Cheyenne telegraph pole in
seventy-four, and was buried.

1009
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,565
But his palace was doin’ big business,
and he had been a kind of attraction,

1010
00:57:59,565 --> 00:58:03,764
and so they always keep a live bear
outside, and some poor fello’, fixed up

1011
00:58:03,764 --> 00:58:07,297
like the Colonel used to be, inside.

1012
00:58:07,297 --> 00:58:09,835
And it’s a turruble mean position.

1013
00:58:09,835 --> 00:58:11,860
Course I’ll cook for yu’.

1014
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,342
Yu’ve a dandy memory for faces!”

1015
00:58:14,342 --> 00:58:19,148
“I wasn’t right convinced till I kicked
him off and you gave that shut to your

1016
00:58:19,148 --> 00:58:20,550
eyes again,” said the Virginian.

1017
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:23,591
Once more the door opened.

1018
00:58:23,591 --> 00:58:28,685
A man with slim black eyebrows,
slim black mustache,

1019
00:58:28,685 --> 00:58:33,595
and a black shirt tied with a white
handkerchief was looking steadily from

1020
00:58:33,595 --> 00:58:35,817
one to the other of us.

1021
00:58:35,817 --> 00:58:37,040
“Good day!”

1022
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,808
he remarked generally and without
enthusiasm; and to the

1023
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:42,602
Virginian, “Where’s Schoffner?”

1024
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,436
“I expaict he’ll have got his
bottle by now, Trampas.”

1025
00:58:45,436 --> 00:58:47,851
Trampas looked from one to the
other of us again.

1026
00:58:47,851 --> 00:58:50,376
“Didn’t he say he was coming back?”

1027
00:58:50,376 --> 00:58:53,552
“He reminded me he was going for a
bottle, and afteh that he didn’t wait

1028
00:58:53,552 --> 00:58:54,552
to say a thing.”

1029
00:58:54,552 --> 00:58:57,558
Trampas looked at the platform and the
railing and the steps.

1030
00:58:57,558 --> 00:59:00,806
“He told me he was coming
back,” he insisted.

1031
00:59:00,806 --> 00:59:06,214
“I don’t reckon he has come,
not without he clumb up ahaid somewhere.

1032
00:59:06,214 --> 00:59:10,966
An’ I mus’ say, when he got off he didn’t
look like a man does when he has

1033
00:59:10,966 --> -1:59:59,000
the intention o’ returnin’.

1034
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1035
00:59:12,534 --> 00:59:16,587
At this Scipio coughed,
and pared his nails attentively.

1036
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:19,671
We had already been avoiding
each other’s eye.

1037
00:59:19,671 --> 00:59:21,214
Shorty did not count.

1038
00:59:21,214 --> 00:59:25,527
Since he got aboard, his meek seat had
been the bottom step.

1039
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:29,620
The thoughts of Trampas seemed
to be in difficulty.

1040
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:32,261
“How long’s this train been started?”

1041
00:59:32,261 --> 00:59:33,087
he demanded.

1042
00:59:33,087 --> 00:59:34,694
“This hyeh train?”

1043
00:59:34,694 --> 00:59:37,007
The Virginian consulted his watch.

1044
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:41,132
“Why, it’s been fanning it a right smart
little while,” said he,

1045
00:59:41,132 --> 00:59:44,412
laying no stress upon
his indolent syllables.

1046
00:59:44,412 --> 00:59:44,953
“Huh!”

1047
00:59:44,953 --> 00:59:46,563
went Trampas.

1048
00:59:46,563 --> 00:59:51,132
He gave the rest of us
a final unlovely scrutiny.

1049
00:59:51,132 --> 00:59:54,860
“It seems to have become a
passenger train,” he said.

1050
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:58,497
And he returned abruptly
inside the caboose.

1051
00:59:58,497 --> 01:00:00,530
“Is he the member who don’t sing?”

1052
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,609
asked Scipio.

1053
01:00:01,609 --> 01:00:04,519
“That’s the specimen,”
replied the Southerner.

1054
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:08,140
“He don’t seem musical in
the face,” said Scipio.

1055
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:08,834
“Pshaw!”

1056
01:00:08,834 --> 01:00:10,553
returned the Virginian.

1057
01:00:10,553 --> 01:00:15,194
“Why, you surely ain’t the man to mind
ugly mugs when they’re hollow!”

1058
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:18,110
The noise inside had dropped
quickly to stillness.

1059
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:20,390
You could scarcely catch
the sound of talk.

1060
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:26,198
Our caboose was clicking comfortably
westward, rail after rail,

1061
01:00:26,198 --> 01:00:30,734
mile upon mile, while night was
beginning to rise from earth

1062
01:00:30,734 --> 01:00:32,439
into the clouded sky.

1063
01:00:32,439 --> 01:00:36,525
“I wonder if they have sent a search
party forward to hunt Schoffner?”

1064
01:00:36,525 --> 01:00:37,706
said the Virginian.

1065
01:00:37,706 --> 01:00:39,931
“I think I’ll maybe join their meeting.”

1066
01:00:39,931 --> 01:00:41,439
He opened the door upon them.

1067
01:00:41,439 --> 01:00:44,392
“Kind o’ dark hyeh, ain’t it?”

1068
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:45,574
said he.

1069
01:00:45,574 --> 01:00:48,613
And lighting the lantern, he shut us out.

1070
01:00:48,613 --> 01:00:51,318
“What do yu’ think?”

1071
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:53,579
said Scipio to me.

1072
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:56,420
“Will he take them to Sunk Creek?”

1073
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,360
“He evidently thinks he will,” said I.

1074
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,680
“He says he will, and he has the
courage of his convictions.”

1075
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,776
“That ain’t near enough courage to have!”

1076
01:01:05,776 --> 01:01:07,344
Scipio exclaimed.

1077
01:01:07,344 --> 01:01:11,960
“There’s times in life when a man has got
to have courage withoutconvictions⁠—

1078
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,519
without them⁠—or he is no good.

1079
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:19,754
Now your friend is that deep constitooted
that you don’t know and I don’t know

1080
01:01:19,754 --> 01:01:21,987
what he’s thinkin’ about all this.”

1081
01:01:21,987 --> 01:01:25,867
“If there’s to be any gunplay,”
put in the excellent Shorty,

1082
01:01:25,867 --> 01:01:27,164
“I’ll stand in with him.”

1083
01:01:27,164 --> 01:01:30,079
“Ah, go to bed with your gunplay!”

1084
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,656
retorted Scipio, entirely good-humored.

1085
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:38,340
“Is the Judge paying for a carload of
dead punchers to gather his beef for

1086
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:38,785
him?

1087
01:01:38,785 --> 01:01:42,769
And this ain’t a proposition worth a
man’s gettin’ hurt for himself, anyway.”

1088
01:01:42,769 --> 01:01:45,492
“That’s so,” Shorty assented.

1089
01:01:45,492 --> 01:01:51,090
“No,” speculated Scipio,
as the night drew deeper round us and

1090
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:54,340
the caboose click-clucked and click-
clucked over the rail joints;

1091
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,651
“he’s waitin’ for somebody else
to open this pot.

1092
01:01:56,651 --> 01:02:00,340
I’ll bet he don’t know but one thing now,
and that’s that nobody else shall know

1093
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,875
he don’t know anything.”

1094
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:03,932
Scipio had delivered himself.

1095
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:07,272
He lighted a cigarette,
and no more wisdom came from him.

1096
01:02:07,272 --> 01:02:10,125
The night was established.

1097
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:12,833
The rolling badlands sank away in it.

1098
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:18,268
A train-hand had arrived over the roof,
and hanging the red lights out behind,

1099
01:02:18,268 --> 01:02:23,497
left us again without remark
or symptom of curiosity.

1100
01:02:23,497 --> 01:02:27,705
The train-hands seemed interested in
their own society and lived

1101
01:02:27,705 --> 01:02:30,358
in their own caboose.

1102
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:35,758
A chill wind with wet in it came blowing
from the invisible draws,

1103
01:02:35,758 --> -1:59:59,000
and brought the feel
of the distant mountains

1104
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

1105
01:02:39,936 --> 01:02:41,387
“That’s Montana!”

1106
01:02:41,387 --> 01:02:44,031
said Scipio, snuffing.

1107
01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:46,591
“I am glad to have it
inside my lungs again.”

1108
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:48,696
“Ain’t yu’ getting cool out there?”

1109
01:02:48,696 --> 01:02:50,465
said the Virginian’s voice.

1110
01:02:50,465 --> 01:02:52,017
“Plenty room inside.”

1111
01:02:52,017 --> 01:02:56,892
Perhaps he had expected us to follow him;
or perhaps he had meant us to delay long

1112
01:02:56,892 --> 01:02:59,993
enough not to seem like a reinforcement.

1113
01:02:59,993 --> 01:03:05,394
“These gentlemen missed the express at
Medora,” he observed to his men, simply.

1114
01:03:05,394 --> 01:03:09,978
What they took us for upon our entrance I
cannot say, or what they believed.

1115
01:03:09,978 --> 01:03:16,012
The atmosphere of the caboose was charged
with voiceless currents of thought.

1116
01:03:16,012 --> 01:03:20,633
By way of a friendly beginning to the
three hundred miles of caboose we were

1117
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:24,273
now to share so intimately,
I recalled myself to them.

1118
01:03:24,273 --> 01:03:27,633
I trusted no more of the Christian
Endeavor had delayed them.

1119
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:31,102
“I am so lucky to have caught
you again,” I finished.

1120
01:03:31,102 --> 01:03:34,527
“I was afraid my last chance of reaching
the Judge’s had gone.”

1121
01:03:34,527 --> 01:03:38,353
Thus I said a number of things designed
to be agreeable, but they met my small

1122
01:03:38,353 --> 01:03:40,375
talk with the smallest talk you can
have.

1123
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:46,951
“Yes,” for instance, and “Pretty well,
I guess,” and grave strikings of matches

1124
01:03:46,951 --> -1:59:59,000
and thoughtful looks at the floor

1125
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

1126
01:03:48,784 --> 01:03:52,704
I suppose we had made twenty miles to the
imperturbable clicking of the caboose

1127
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:56,067
when one at length asked his neighbor
had he ever seen New York.

1128
01:03:56,067 --> 01:03:58,265
“No,” said the other.

1129
01:03:58,265 --> -1:59:59,000
“Flooded with dudes, ain’t it?

1130
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1131
01:04:01,269 --> 01:04:04,045
“Swimmin’,” said the first.

1132
01:04:04,045 --> 01:04:06,767
“Leakin’, too,” said a third.

1133
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:08,721
“Well, my gracious!”

1134
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:12,105
said a fourth, and beat his
knee in private delight.

1135
01:04:12,105 --> 01:04:14,120
None of them ever looked at me.

1136
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:18,831
For some reason I felt
exceedingly ill at ease.

1137
01:04:18,831 --> 01:04:22,023
“Good clothes in New York,”
said the third.

1138
01:04:22,023 --> 01:04:24,375
“Rich food,” said the first.

1139
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:27,422
“Fresh eggs, too,” said the third.

1140
01:04:27,422 --> 01:04:29,649
“Well, my gracious!”

1141
01:04:29,649 --> 01:04:31,733
said the fourth, beating his knee.

1142
01:04:31,733 --> 01:04:36,249
“Why, yes,” observed the Virginian,
unexpectedly; “they tell me that aiggs

1143
01:04:36,249 --> 01:04:40,631
there ain’t liable to be so rotten as
yu’ll strike ’em in this country.”

1144
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:44,184
None of them had a reply for this,
and New York was abandoned.

1145
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:46,112
For some reason I felt much better.

1146
01:04:46,112 --> 01:04:50,231
It was a new line they adopted next,
led off by Trampas.

1147
01:04:50,231 --> 01:04:51,571
“Going to the excitement?”

1148
01:04:51,571 --> 01:04:54,299
he inquired, selecting Shorty.

1149
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:55,331
“Excitement?”

1150
01:04:55,331 --> 01:04:56,736
said Shorty, looking up.

1151
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:58,842
“Going to Rawhide?”

1152
01:04:58,842 --> 01:05:00,310
Trampas repeated.

1153
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,974
And all watched Shorty.

1154
01:05:01,974 --> 01:05:05,982
“Why, I’m all adrift missin’
that express,” said Shorty.

1155
01:05:05,982 --> 01:05:11,180
“Maybe I can give you
employment,” suggested the Virginian.

1156
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,300
“I am taking an outfit across the basin.”

1157
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:16,374
“You’ll find most folks going to Rawhide,
if you’re looking for company,”

1158
01:05:16,374 --> 01:05:19,054
pursued Trampas, fishing for a recruit.

1159
01:05:19,054 --> 01:05:20,844
“How about Rawhide, anyway?”

1160
01:05:20,844 --> 01:05:24,589
said Scipio, skillfully
deflecting this missionary work.

1161
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:26,636
“Are they taking much mineral out?

1162
01:05:26,636 --> 01:05:29,309
Have yu’ seen any of the rock?”

1163
01:05:29,309 --> 01:05:30,300
“Rock?”

1164
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:34,075
broke in the enthusiast who
had beaten his knee.

1165
01:05:34,075 --> 01:05:34,964
“There!”

1166
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:36,828
And he brought some from his pocket.

1167
01:05:36,828 --> 01:05:40,852
“You’re always showing your rock,”
said Trampas, sulkily;

1168
01:05:40,852 --> 01:05:45,449
for Scipio now held the conversation,
and Shorty returned safely to his

1169
01:05:45,449 --> 01:05:46,569
dozing.

1170
01:05:46,569 --> 01:05:46,624
“H’m!”

1171
01:05:46,624 --> 01:05:48,064
went Scipio at the rock.

1172
01:05:48,064 --> 01:05:52,602
He turned it back and forth in his hand,
looking it over; he chucked and caught

1173
01:05:52,602 --> 01:05:55,760
it slightingly in the air,
and handed it back.

1174
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,991
“Porphyry, I see.”

1175
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,753
That was his only word about it.

1176
01:05:58,753 --> 01:06:00,596
He said it cheerily.

1177
01:06:00,596 --> 01:06:03,834
He left no room for discussion.

1178
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:06,386
You could not damn a thing worse.

1179
01:06:06,386 --> 01:06:08,834
“Ever been in Santa Rita?”

1180
01:06:08,834 --> 01:06:13,365
pursued Scipio, while the enthusiast
slowly pushed his rock

1181
01:06:13,365 --> 01:06:14,464
back into his pocket.

1182
01:06:14,464 --> 01:06:16,381
“That’s down in New Mexico.

1183
01:06:16,381 --> 01:06:18,529
Ever been to Globe, Arizona?”

1184
01:06:18,529 --> 01:06:21,406
And Scipio talked away about the
mines he had known.

1185
01:06:21,406 --> 01:06:24,523
There was no getting at Shorty
any more that evening.

1186
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:29,322
Trampas was foiled of his fish,
or of learning how the fish’s heart lay.

1187
01:06:29,322 --> 01:06:32,834
And by morning Shorty had been carefully
instructed to change his mind

1188
01:06:32,834 --> 01:06:34,433
about once an hour.

1189
01:06:34,433 --> 01:06:39,255
This is apt to discourage all
but very superior missionaries.

1190
01:06:39,255 --> 01:06:41,815
And I too escaped for the
rest of this night.

1191
01:06:41,815 --> 01:06:47,881
At Glendive we had a dim supper,
and I bought some blankets;

1192
01:06:47,881 --> 01:06:52,188
and after that it was late,
and sleep occupied the

1193
01:06:52,188 --> 01:06:53,634
attention of us all.

1194
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:59,438
We lay along the shelves of the caboose,
a peaceful sight I should think,

1195
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:02,404
in that smoothly trundling cradle.

1196
01:07:02,404 --> 01:07:07,275
I slept almost immediately,
so tired that not even our stops or

1197
01:07:07,275 --> 01:07:12,293
anything else waked me,
save once, when the air I was breathing

1198
01:07:12,293 --> 01:07:14,621
grew suddenly pure, and I roused.

1199
01:07:14,621 --> 01:07:19,255
Sitting in the door was the lonely
figure of the Virginian.

1200
01:07:19,255 --> 01:07:23,317
He leaned in silent contemplation of the
occasional moon, and beneath it

1201
01:07:23,317 --> 01:07:26,062
the Yellowstone’s swift ripples.

1202
01:07:26,062 --> 01:07:31,480
On the caboose shelves the others slept
sound and still, each stretched or

1203
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,160
coiled as he had first put himself.

1204
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:39,481
They were not untrustworthy to look at,
it seemed to me⁠—except Trampas.

1205
01:07:39,481 --> 01:07:43,932
You would have said the rest of that
young humanity was average rough male

1206
01:07:43,932 --> 01:07:48,212
blood, merely needing to be told the
proper things at the right time;

1207
01:07:48,212 --> 01:07:53,772
and one big bunchy stocking of the
enthusiast stuck out of his blanket,

1208
01:07:53,772 --> 01:07:57,011
solemn and innocent, and I laughed at
it.

1209
01:07:57,011 --> 01:08:01,694
There was a light sound by the door,
and I found the Virginian’s eye on me.

1210
01:08:01,694 --> 01:08:06,382
Finding who it was, he nodded and
motioned with his hand to go to sleep.

1211
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:10,029
And this I did with him in my sight,
still leaning in the open door,

1212
01:08:10,029 --> 01:08:12,932
through which came the interrupted moon
and the swimming reaches

1213
01:08:12,932 --> 01:08:13,892
of the Yellowstone.

1214
01:08:13,892 --> 01:08:14,732
CHAPTER XVI

1215
01:08:14,732 --> 01:08:17,132
The Game The Nation—Last Act

1216
01:08:17,132 --> 01:08:21,476
It has happened to you,
has it not, to wake in the morning and

1217
01:08:21,476 --> 01:08:24,597
wonder for a while where
on earth you are?

1218
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:29,889
Thus I came half to life in the caboose,
hearing voices, but not the

1219
01:08:29,889 --> 01:08:32,229
actual words at first.

1220
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:34,340
But presently, “Hathaway!”

1221
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,943
said someone more clearly.

1222
01:08:35,943 --> 01:08:39,423
“Portland 1,291!”

1223
01:08:39,423 --> 01:08:43,862
This made no special stir in my
intelligence, and I drowsed off again to

1224
01:08:43,862 --> 01:08:46,937
the pleasant rhythm of the wheels.

1225
01:08:46,937 --> 01:08:50,816
The little shock of stopping next brought
me to, somewhat, with the voices still

1226
01:08:50,816 --> 01:08:54,220
round me; and when we were again in
motion, I heard: “Rosebud!

1227
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:55,262
Portland

1228
01:08:55,262 --> -1:59:59,000
1,279

1229
-1:59:59,000 --> -1:59:59,000
!

1230
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1231
01:08:56,639 --> 01:09:02,533
These figures jarred me awake,
and I said, “It was 1,291 before,”

1232
01:09:02,533 --> 01:09:04,393
and sat up in my blankets.

1233
01:09:04,393 --> 01:09:09,710
The greeting they vouchsafed and the
sight of them clustering expressionless

1234
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:14,392
in the caboose brought last evening’s
uncomfortable memory back to me.

1235
01:09:14,392 --> 01:09:19,245
Our next stop revealed how
things were going today.

1236
01:09:19,245 --> 01:09:21,920
“Forsythe,” one of them
read on the station.

1237
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,988
“Portland 1,266.”

1238
01:09:24,988 --> 01:09:27,828
They were counting the
lessening distance westward.

1239
01:09:27,828 --> 01:09:31,823
This was the undercurrent of war.

1240
01:09:31,823 --> 01:09:38,222
It broke on me as I procured fresh water
at Forsythe and made some toilet

1241
01:09:38,222 --> 01:09:40,152
in their stolid presence.

1242
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:44,759
We were drawing nearer the Rawhide
station⁠—the point, I mean,

1243
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:48,139
where you left the railway
for the new mines.

1244
01:09:48,139 --> 01:09:51,638
Now Rawhide station lay
this side of Billings.

1245
01:09:51,638 --> 01:09:57,048
The broad path of desertion would open
ready for their feet when the narrow

1246
01:09:57,048 --> 01:10:03,048
path to duty and Sunk Creek was still
some fifty miles more to wait.

1247
01:10:03,048 --> 01:10:08,342
Here was Trampas’s great strength;
he need make no move meanwhile,

1248
01:10:08,342 --> 01:10:14,265
but lie low for the immediate temptation
to front and waylay them and win his

1249
01:10:14,265 --> 01:10:16,082
battle over the deputy foreman.

1250
01:10:16,082 --> 01:10:20,185
But the Virginian seemed to find nothing
save enjoyment in this sunny September

1251
01:10:20,185 --> 01:10:23,390
morning, and ate his
breakfast at Forsythe serenely.

1252
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:28,145
That meal done and that station gone,
our caboose took up again its easy

1253
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:30,421
trundle by the banks of the Yellowstone.

1254
01:10:30,421 --> 01:10:35,136
The mutineers sat for a
while digesting in idleness.

1255
01:10:35,136 --> 01:10:36,600
“What’s your scar?”

1256
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,245
inquired one at length inspecting
casually the neck of his neighbor.

1257
01:10:40,245 --> 01:10:42,131
“Foolishness,” the other answered.

1258
01:10:42,131 --> 01:10:42,856
“Yourn?”

1259
01:10:42,856 --> 01:10:44,357
“Mine.”

1260
01:10:44,357 --> 01:10:48,901
“Well, I don’t know but I prefer to have
myself to thank for a

1261
01:10:48,901 --> 01:10:50,451
thing,” said the first.

1262
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:53,731
“I was displaying myself,”
continued the second.

1263
01:10:53,731 --> 01:10:56,123
“One day last summer it was.

1264
01:10:56,123 --> 01:10:59,981
We come on a big snake
by Torrey Creek corral.

1265
01:10:59,981 --> 01:11:04,135
The boys got betting pretty lively that I
dassent make my word good as to dealing

1266
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:09,977
with him, so I loped my cayuse full tilt
by Mr. Snake, and swung down and catched

1267
01:11:09,977 --> 01:11:13,947
him up by the tail from the ground,
and cracked him same as a whip,

1268
01:11:13,947 --> 01:11:15,731
and snapped his head off.

1269
01:11:15,731 --> 01:11:16,919
You’ve saw it done?”

1270
01:11:16,919 --> 01:11:18,369
he said to the audience.

1271
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:20,984
The audience nodded wearily.

1272
01:11:20,984 --> 01:11:26,240
“But the loose head flew agin me,
and the fangs caught.

1273
01:11:26,240 --> -1:59:59,000
I was pretty sick for a while.

1274
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1275
01:11:28,233 --> 01:11:31,083
“It don’t pay to be clumsy,”
said the first man.

1276
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:36,774
“If you’d snapped the snake away from yu’
instead of toward yu’, its head would

1277
01:11:36,774 --> 01:11:40,650
have whirled off into the brush,
same as they do with me.”

1278
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:44,516
“How like a knife-cut your scar looks!”

1279
01:11:44,516 --> 01:11:45,101
said I.

1280
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:45,463
“Don’t it?”

1281
01:11:45,463 --> 01:11:47,399
said the snake-snapper.

1282
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:49,769
“There’s many that gets fooled by it.”

1283
01:11:49,769 --> 01:11:54,019
“An antelope knows a snake is his enemy,”
said another to me.

1284
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:57,263
“Ever seen a buck circling round
and round a rattler?”

1285
01:11:57,263 --> 01:12:01,340
“I have always wanted to see
that,” said I, heartily.

1286
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:04,380
For this I knew to be a
respectable piece of truth.

1287
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,651
“It’s worth seeing,” the man went on.

1288
01:12:06,651 --> 01:12:11,050
“After the buck gets close in,
he gives an almighty jump up in the air,

1289
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:14,990
and down comes his four hoofs in a bunch
right on top of Mr. Snake.

1290
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:16,691
Cuts him all to hash.

1291
01:12:16,691 --> -1:59:59,000
Now you tell me how the buck knows that.

1292
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1293
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:20,439
Of course I could not tell him.

1294
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:25,145
And again we sat in silence for a while⁠—
friendlier silence, I thought.

1295
01:12:25,145 --> 01:12:29,566
“A skunk’ll kill yu’ worse than a snake
bite,” said another, presently.

1296
01:12:29,566 --> 01:12:34,331
“No, I don’t mean that way,” he added.

1297
01:12:34,331 --> 01:12:35,585
For I had smiled.

1298
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:39,182
“There is a brown skunk down in Arkansaw.

1299
01:12:39,182 --> 01:12:41,498
Kind of prairie-dog brown.

1300
01:12:41,498 --> 01:12:44,518
Littler than our variety, he is.

1301
01:12:44,518 --> 01:12:49,914
And he is mad the whole year round,
same as a dog gets.

1302
01:12:49,914 --> 01:12:55,360
Only the dog has a spell and dies but
this here Arkansaw skunk is mad right

1303
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,932
along, and it don’t seem to interfere
with his business in other respects.

1304
01:12:58,932 --> 01:13:03,103
Well, suppose you’re camping out,
and suppose it’s a hot night,

1305
01:13:03,103 --> 01:13:05,854
or you’re in a hurry,
and you’ve made camp late,

1306
01:13:05,854 --> 01:13:10,495
or anyway you haven’t got inside any
tent, but you have just bedded

1307
01:13:10,495 --> 01:13:11,600
down in the open.

1308
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,568
Skunk comes travelling along and
walks on your blankets.

1309
01:13:15,568 --> 01:13:16,395
You’re warm.

1310
01:13:16,395 --> 01:13:18,783
He likes that, same as a cat does.

1311
01:13:18,783 --> 01:13:22,896
And he tramps with pleasure and comfort,
same as a cat.

1312
01:13:22,896 --> 01:13:24,779
And you move.

1313
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:27,337
You get bit, that’s all.

1314
01:13:27,337 --> 01:13:31,047
And you die of hydrophobia.

1315
01:13:31,047 --> -1:59:59,000
Ask anybody.

1316
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1317
01:13:33,498 --> 01:13:35,774
“Most extraordinary!”

1318
01:13:35,774 --> 01:13:37,253
said I.

1319
01:13:37,253 --> 01:13:48,704
“But did you ever see a
person die from this?”

1320
01:13:48,704 --> 01:13:51,757
“No, sir.

1321
01:13:51,757 --> 01:13:55,358
Never happened to.

1322
01:13:55,358 --> 01:13:57,518
My cousin at Bald Knob did.”

1323
01:13:57,518 --> 01:13:58,301
“Died?”

1324
01:13:58,301 --> 01:13:59,264
“No, sir.

1325
01:13:59,264 --> 01:14:00,472
Saw a man.”

1326
01:14:00,472 --> 01:14:03,388
“But how do you know they’re
not sick skunks?”

1327
01:14:03,388 --> 01:14:04,157
“No, sir!

1328
01:14:04,157 --> 01:14:05,409
They’re well skunks.

1329
01:14:05,409 --> 01:14:07,824
Well as anything.

1330
01:14:07,824 --> 01:14:11,639
You’ll not meet skunks in any state of
the Union more robust

1331
01:14:11,639 --> 01:14:13,580
than them in Arkansaw.

1332
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,632
And thick.”

1333
01:14:14,632 --> 01:14:17,519
“That’s awful true,” sighed another.

1334
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:22,156
“I have buried hundreds of dollars’ worth
of clothes in Arkansaw.”

1335
01:14:22,156 --> 01:14:24,758
“Why didn’t yu’ travel in a sponge bag?”

1336
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:26,830
inquired Scipio.

1337
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:28,683
And this brought a slight silence.

1338
01:14:28,683 --> 01:14:32,941
“Speakin’ of bites,” spoke up a
new man, “how’s that?”

1339
01:14:32,941 --> 01:14:34,078
He held up his thumb.

1340
01:14:34,078 --> 01:14:34,765
“My!”

1341
01:14:34,765 --> 01:14:35,908
breathed Scipio.

1342
01:14:35,908 --> 01:14:37,374
“Must have been a lion.”

1343
01:14:37,374 --> 01:14:39,115
The man wore a wounded look.

1344
01:14:39,115 --> 01:14:44,528
“I was huntin’ owl eggs for a botanist
from Boston,” he explained to me.

1345
01:14:44,528 --> 01:14:46,961
“Chiropodist, weren’t he?”

1346
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:49,642
said Scipio.

1347
01:14:49,642 --> 01:14:51,203
“Or maybe a sonnabulator?”

1348
01:14:51,203 --> 01:14:56,719
“No, honest,” protested the man with the
thumb; so that I was sorry for him,

1349
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:58,409
and begged him to go on.

1350
01:14:58,409 --> 01:15:00,787
“I’ll listen to you,” I assured him.

1351
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:04,193
And I wondered why this politeness of
mine should throw one or two of

1352
01:15:04,193 --> 01:15:05,690
them into stifled mirth.

1353
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:10,250
Scipio, on the other hand,
gave me a disgusted look and sat back

1354
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:12,730
sullenly for a moment,
and then took himself out on the

1355
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:15,162
platform, where the Virginian
was lounging.

1356
01:15:15,162 --> 01:15:19,845
“The young feller wore knee-pants and
ever so thick spectacles with a half-

1357
01:15:19,845 --> 01:15:24,516
moon cut in ’em,” resumed the narrator,
“and he carried a tin box strung to a

1358
01:15:24,516 --> 01:15:30,128
strap I took for his lunch till it flew
open on him and a horn toad hustled out.

1359
01:15:30,128 --> 01:15:34,537
Then I was sure he was a botanist⁠—or
whatever yu’ say they’re called.

1360
01:15:34,537 --> 01:15:39,542
Well, he would have owl eggs⁠—them little
prairie-owl that some claim can turn

1361
01:15:39,542 --> 01:15:44,306
their head clean around and keep a-
watchin’ yu’, only that’s nonsense.

1362
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:48,197
We was ridin’ through that prairie-dog
town, used to be on the flat just after

1363
01:15:48,197 --> 01:15:51,568
yu’ crossed the south fork of Powder
River on the Buffalo trail,

1364
01:15:51,568 --> 01:15:55,399
and I said I’d dig an owl nest out for
him if he was willing to camp

1365
01:15:55,399 --> 01:15:56,209
till I’d dug it.

1366
01:15:56,209 --> 01:16:01,600
I wanted to know about them owls some
myself⁠—if they did live with the dogs

1367
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,236
and snakes, yu’ know,”
he broke off, appealing to me.

1368
01:16:05,236 --> 01:16:07,263
“Oh, yes,” I told him eagerly.

1369
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:12,605
“So while the botanist went glarin’
around the town with his glasses to see

1370
01:16:12,605 --> 01:16:16,845
if he could spot a prairie-dog and an
owl usin’ the same hole,

1371
01:16:16,845 --> 01:16:19,525
I was diggin’ in a hole I’d seen
an owl run down.

1372
01:16:19,525 --> 01:16:21,204
And that’s what I got.”

1373
01:16:21,204 --> 01:16:22,924
He held up his thumb again.

1374
01:16:22,924 --> 01:16:23,905
“The snake!”

1375
01:16:23,905 --> 01:16:24,977
I exclaimed.

1376
01:16:24,977 --> 01:16:25,983
“Yes, sir.

1377
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,385
Mr.

1378
01:16:26,385 --> 01:16:29,105
Rattler was keepin’ house that day.

1379
01:16:29,105 --> 01:16:30,666
Took me right there.

1380
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:34,085
I hauled him out of the
hole hangin’ to me.

1381
01:16:34,085 --> -1:59:59,000
Eight rattles.

1382
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1383
01:16:37,049 --> 01:16:37,477
“Eight!”

1384
01:16:37,477 --> 01:16:38,488
said I.

1385
01:16:38,488 --> -1:59:59,000
“A big one.

1386
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1387
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:43,481
“Yes, sir.

1388
01:16:43,481 --> 01:16:45,357
Thought I was dead.

1389
01:16:45,357 --> 01:16:46,779
But the woman⁠—”

1390
01:16:46,779 --> 01:16:47,530
“The woman?”

1391
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:48,237
said I.

1392
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:50,097
“Yes, woman.

1393
01:16:50,097 --> 01:16:55,121
Didn’t I tell yu’ the botanist
had his wife along?

1394
01:16:55,121 --> 01:16:56,688
Well, he did.

1395
01:16:56,688 --> 01:17:00,640
And she acted better than the man,
for he was losin’ his head,

1396
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,834
and shoutin’ he had no whiskey,
and he didn’t guess his knife was sharp

1397
01:17:03,834 --> 01:17:07,085
enough to amputate my thumb,
and none of us chewed,

1398
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:11,770
and the doctor was twenty miles away,
and if he had only remembered to bring

1399
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:16,771
his ammonia⁠—well, he was screeching out
’most everything he knew in the world,

1400
01:17:16,771 --> 01:17:19,742
and without arranging it any, neither.

1401
01:17:19,742 --> 01:17:22,733
But she just clawed his pocket and
burrowed and kep’ yelling,

1402
01:17:22,733 --> 01:17:24,425
‘Give him the stone, Augustus!’

1403
01:17:24,425 --> 01:17:28,521
And she whipped out one of them Injun
medicine-stones⁠—first one I ever seen⁠—

1404
01:17:28,521 --> -1:59:59,000
and she clapped it on to my thumb,
and it started in right away.

1405
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1406
01:17:31,976 --> 01:17:33,265
“What did it do?”

1407
01:17:33,265 --> 01:17:34,859
said I.

1408
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:35,540
“Sucked.

1409
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,351
Like blotting-paper does.

1410
01:17:38,351 --> 01:17:41,414
Soft and funny it was, and gray.

1411
01:17:41,414 --> 01:17:43,472
They get ’em from elks’
stomachs, yu’ know.

1412
01:17:43,472 --> 01:17:47,071
And when it had sucked the poison out of
the wound, off it falls of

1413
01:17:47,071 --> 01:17:49,001
my thumb by itself!

1414
01:17:49,001 --> 01:17:51,521
And I thanked the woman for saving my
life that capable and keeping

1415
01:17:51,521 --> 01:17:52,849
her head that cool.

1416
01:17:52,849 --> 01:17:56,659
I never knowed how excited she
had been till afterward.

1417
01:17:56,659 --> -1:59:59,000
She was awful shocked.

1418
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1419
01:17:58,755 --> 01:18:03,719
“I suppose she started to talk when the
danger was over,” said I,

1420
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:05,686
with deep silence around me.

1421
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:08,002
“No; she didn’t say nothing to me.

1422
01:18:08,002 --> 01:18:11,519
But when her next child was born,
it had eight rattles.”

1423
01:18:11,519 --> 01:18:14,900
Din now rose wild in the caboose.

1424
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,195
They rocked together.

1425
01:18:16,195 --> 01:18:20,565
The enthusiast beat his knee tumultuously.

1426
01:18:20,565 --> 01:18:21,863
And I joined them.

1427
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,052
Who could help it?

1428
01:18:23,052 --> 01:18:27,332
It had been so well conducted
from the imperceptible beginning.

1429
01:18:27,332 --> 01:18:31,432
Fact and falsehood blended
with such perfect art.

1430
01:18:31,432 --> 01:18:36,535
And this last, an effect so new made with
such world-old material!

1431
01:18:36,535 --> 01:18:40,376
I cared nothing that I was the victim,
and I joined them; but ceased,

1432
01:18:40,376 --> 01:18:43,390
feeling suddenly somehow
estranged or chilled.

1433
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:44,926
It was in their laughter.

1434
01:18:44,926 --> 01:18:47,086
The loudness was too loud.

1435
01:18:47,086 --> 01:18:50,877
And I caught the eyes of Trampas fixed
upon the Virginian with

1436
01:18:50,877 --> 01:18:54,233
exultant malevolence.

1437
01:18:54,233 --> 01:18:58,160
Scipio’s disgusted glance was upon
me from the door.

1438
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:02,993
Dazed by these signs,
I went out on the platform to get

1439
01:19:02,993 --> 01:19:04,995
away from the noise.

1440
01:19:04,995 --> 01:19:07,750
There the Virginian said to me: “Cheer up!

1441
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:10,587
You’ll not be so easy for ’em that-
a-way next season.”

1442
01:19:10,587 --> 01:19:13,878
He said no more; and with his legs
dangled over the railing,

1443
01:19:13,878 --> 01:19:15,593
appeared to resume his newspaper.

1444
01:19:15,593 --> 01:19:16,486
“What’s the matter?”

1445
01:19:16,486 --> 01:19:17,754
said I to Scipio.

1446
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:21,017
“Oh, I don’t mind if he
don’t,” Scipio answered.

1447
01:19:21,017 --> 01:19:22,137
“Couldn’t yu’ see?

1448
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:25,257
I tried to head ’em off from yu’ all I
knew, but yu’ just ran

1449
01:19:25,257 --> 01:19:26,409
in among ’em yourself.

1450
01:19:26,409 --> 01:19:27,525
Couldn’t yu’ see?

1451
01:19:27,525 --> 01:19:33,171
Kep’ hinderin’ and spoilin’ me with
askin’ those urgent questions of yourn⁠—

1452
01:19:33,171 --> 01:19:35,895
why, I had to let yu’ go your way!

1453
01:19:35,895 --> 01:19:39,436
Why, that wasn’t the ordinary play with
the ordinary tenderfoot

1454
01:19:39,436 --> 01:19:40,450
they treated you to!

1455
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:43,172
You ain’t a common tenderfoot this trip.

1456
01:19:43,172 --> 01:19:45,311
You’re the foreman’s friend.

1457
01:19:45,311 --> 01:19:46,890
They’ve hit him through you.

1458
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,931
That’s the way they count it.

1459
01:19:48,931 --> 01:19:51,025
It’s made them encouraged.

1460
01:19:51,025 --> 01:19:52,102
Can’t yu’ see?”

1461
01:19:52,102 --> 01:19:53,906
Scipio stated it plainly.

1462
01:19:53,906 --> 01:19:56,529
And as we ran by the next
station, “Howard!”

1463
01:19:56,529 --> 01:19:58,047
they harshly yelled.

1464
01:19:58,047 --> 01:20:00,523
“Portland 1256!”

1465
01:20:00,523 --> 01:20:03,420
We had been passing gangs of
workmen on the track.

1466
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:07,222
And at that last yell the Virginian rose.

1467
01:20:07,222 --> 01:20:10,671
“I reckon I’ll join the
meeting again,” he said.

1468
01:20:10,671 --> -1:59:59,000
“This filling and repairing looks like
the washout might have been true.

1469
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1470
01:20:14,354 --> 01:20:15,151
“Washout?”

1471
01:20:15,151 --> 01:20:16,131
said Scipio.

1472
01:20:16,131 --> -1:59:59,000
“Big Horn bridge, they say⁠—four days ago.

1473
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1474
01:20:19,046 --> 01:20:22,693
“Then I wish it came this
side Rawhide station.”

1475
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:23,453
“Do yu’?”

1476
01:20:23,453 --> 01:20:24,496
drawled the Virginian.

1477
01:20:24,496 --> 01:20:29,056
And smiling at Scipio,
he lounged in through the open door.

1478
01:20:29,056 --> 01:20:32,740
“He beats me,” said Scipio,
shaking his head.

1479
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:35,688
“His trail is turruble
hard to anticipate.”

1480
01:20:35,688 --> 01:20:36,312
We listened.

1481
01:20:36,312 --> 01:20:39,864
“Work bein’ done on the road,
I see,” the Virginian was saying,

1482
01:20:39,864 --> 01:20:42,328
very friendly and conversational.

1483
01:20:42,328 --> 01:20:46,030
“We see it too,” said
the voice of Trampas.

1484
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:48,272
“Seem to be easin’ their grades some.”

1485
01:20:48,272 --> 01:20:49,843
“Roads do.”

1486
01:20:49,843 --> 01:20:53,393
“Cheaper to build ’em the way they want
’em at the start, a man would think,”

1487
01:20:53,393 --> 01:20:55,433
suggested the Virginian, most friendly.

1488
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:58,296
“There go some more I-talians.”

1489
01:20:58,296 --> 01:21:00,587
“They’re Chinese,” said Trampas.

1490
01:21:00,587 --> 01:21:04,237
“That’s so,” acknowledged the
Virginian, with a laugh.

1491
01:21:04,237 --> 01:21:06,187
“What’s he monkeyin’ at now?”

1492
01:21:06,187 --> 01:21:07,461
muttered Scipio.

1493
01:21:07,461 --> 01:21:10,307
“Without cheap foreigners they couldn’t
afford all this hyeh new

1494
01:21:10,307 --> 01:21:13,020
gradin’,” the Southerner continued.

1495
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:13,789
“Grading!

1496
01:21:13,789 --> 01:21:16,642
Can’t you tell when a flood’s
been eating the banks?”

1497
01:21:16,642 --> 01:21:21,079
“Why, yes,” said the Virginian,
sweet as honey.

1498
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:24,877
“But ’ain’t yu’ heard of the improvements
west of Big Timber, all the way

1499
01:21:24,877 --> 01:21:26,576
to Missoula, this season?

1500
01:21:26,576 --> 01:21:27,846
I’m talkin’ about them.”

1501
01:21:27,846 --> 01:21:28,436
“Oh!

1502
01:21:28,436 --> 01:21:29,791
Talking about them.

1503
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:30,898
Yes, I’ve heard.”

1504
01:21:30,898 --> 01:21:33,599
“Good money-savin’ scheme, ain’t it?”

1505
01:21:33,599 --> 01:21:34,698
said the Virginian.

1506
01:21:34,698 --> 01:21:38,738
“Lettin’ a freight run down one hill an’
up the next as far as she’ll go without

1507
01:21:38,738 --> 01:21:44,590
steam, an’ shavin’ the hill
down to that point.”

1508
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:47,832
Now this was an honest engineering fact.

1509
01:21:47,832 --> 01:21:53,112
“Better’n settin’ dudes squintin’ through
telescopes and cipherin’ over one

1510
01:21:53,112 --> 01:21:56,109
percent reductions,”
the Southerner commented.

1511
01:21:56,109 --> 01:21:59,081
“It’s common sense,” assented Trampas.

1512
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,948
“Have you heard the new scheme
about the water-tanks?”

1513
01:22:01,948 --> 01:22:04,599
“I ain’t right certain,”
said the Southerner.

1514
01:22:04,599 --> 01:22:08,971
“I must watch this,” said Scipio,
“or I shall bust.”

1515
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:11,388
He went in, and so did I.

1516
01:22:11,388 --> 01:22:14,735
They were all sitting over this
discussion of the Northern Pacific’s

1517
01:22:14,735 --> 01:22:18,239
recent policy as to betterments,
as though they were the

1518
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:19,752
board of directors.

1519
01:22:19,752 --> 01:22:21,482
Pins could have dropped.

1520
01:22:21,482 --> 01:22:23,828
Only nobody would have cared
to hear a pin.

1521
01:22:23,828 --> 01:22:28,602
“They used to put all their tanks at the
bottom of their grades,” said Trampas.

1522
01:22:28,602 --> 01:22:31,422
“Why, yu’ get the water
easier at the bottom.”

1523
01:22:31,422 --> 01:22:36,293
“You can pump it to the top,
though,” said Trampas, growing superior.

1524
01:22:36,293 --> 01:22:37,496
“And it’s cheaper.”

1525
01:22:37,496 --> 01:22:40,815
“That gets me,” said the
Virginian, interested.

1526
01:22:40,815 --> 01:22:44,163
“Trains after watering can start down
hill now and get the

1527
01:22:44,163 --> 01:22:45,658
benefit of the gravity.

1528
01:22:45,658 --> 01:22:49,575
It’ll cut down operating expenses a heap.”

1529
01:22:49,575 --> 01:22:51,879
“That’s cert’nly common sense!”

1530
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:54,332
exclaimed the Virginian, absorbed.

1531
01:22:54,332 --> 01:22:56,149
“But ain’t it kind o’ tardy?”

1532
01:22:56,149 --> 01:22:57,826
“Live and learn.

1533
01:22:57,826 --> 01:22:59,498
So they gained speed, too.

1534
01:22:59,498 --> 01:23:04,313
High speed on half the coal this
season, until the accident.”

1535
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:05,329
“Accident!”

1536
01:23:05,329 --> 01:23:07,512
said the Virginian, instantly.

1537
01:23:07,512 --> 01:23:10,333
“Yellowstone Limited.

1538
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:15,023
Man fired at engine driver.

1539
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:21,832
Train was flying past that quick the
bullet broke every window and killed a

1540
01:23:21,832 --> 01:23:23,945
passenger on the back platform.

1541
01:23:23,945 --> 01:23:28,541
You’ve been running too much with
aristocrats,” finished Trampas,

1542
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:29,901
and turned on his heel.

1543
01:23:29,901 --> 01:23:31,534
“Haw, hew!”

1544
01:23:31,534 --> 01:23:35,635
began the enthusiast,
but his neighbor gripped him to silence.

1545
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:38,208
This was a triumph too serious for noise.

1546
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:41,410
Not a mutineer moved; and I felt cold.

1547
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:44,859
“Trampas,” said the Virginian,
“I thought yu’d be afeared to

1548
01:23:44,859 --> 01:23:45,827
try it on me.”

1549
01:23:45,827 --> 01:23:47,402
Trampas whirled round.

1550
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:49,959
His hand was at his belt.

1551
01:23:49,959 --> 01:23:51,621
“Afraid!”

1552
01:23:51,621 --> 01:23:52,592
he sneered.

1553
01:23:52,592 --> 01:23:53,532
“Shorty!”

1554
01:23:53,532 --> 01:23:56,926
said Scipio, sternly,
and leaping upon that youth,

1555
01:23:56,926 --> 01:23:59,336
took his half-drawn pistol from him.

1556
01:23:59,336 --> 01:24:02,902
“I’m obliged to yu’,” said
the Virginian to Scipio.

1557
01:24:02,902 --> 01:24:05,757
Trampas’s hand left his belt.

1558
01:24:05,757 --> 01:24:09,888
He threw a slight, easy look at his men,
and keeping his back to the Virginian,

1559
01:24:09,888 --> 01:24:13,498
walked out on the platform and sat on
the chair where the Virginian

1560
01:24:13,498 --> 01:24:14,712
had sat so much.

1561
01:24:14,712 --> 01:24:18,009
“Don’t you comprehend,”
said the Virginian to Shorty,

1562
01:24:18,009 --> 01:24:22,671
amiably, “that this hyeh question has
been discussed peaceable

1563
01:24:22,671 --> 01:24:24,911
by civilized citizens?

1564
01:24:24,911 --> 01:24:29,431
Now you sit down and be good,
and Mr. Le Moyne will return your gun

1565
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:33,395
when we’re across that broken bridge,
if they have got it fixed

1566
01:24:33,395 --> 01:24:34,940
for heavy trains yet.”

1567
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:39,296
“This train will be lighter when it gets
to that bridge,” spoke Trampas,

1568
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,341
out on his chair.

1569
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:42,648
“Why, that’s true, too!”

1570
01:24:42,648 --> 01:24:43,701
said the Virginian.

1571
01:24:43,701 --> 01:24:47,470
“Maybe none of us are crossin’ that Big
Horn bridge now, except me.

1572
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:53,328
Funny if yu’ should end by persuadin’ me
to quit and go to Rawhide myself!

1573
01:24:53,328 --> 01:24:54,918
But I reckon I’ll not.

1574
01:24:54,918 --> -1:59:59,000
I reckon I’ll worry along
to Sunk Creek, somehow.

1575
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1576
01:24:57,979 --> 01:25:01,968
“Don’t forget I’m cookin’ for
yu’,” said Scipio, gruffy.

1577
01:25:01,968 --> 01:25:04,608
“I’m obliged to yu’,” said the Southerner.

1578
01:25:04,608 --> 01:25:07,868
“You were speaking of a job
for me,” said Shorty.

1579
01:25:07,868 --> 01:25:09,683
“I’m right obliged.

1580
01:25:09,683 --> 01:25:15,149
But yu’ see⁠—I ain’t exackly foreman the
way this comes out, and my promises

1581
01:25:15,149 --> -1:59:59,000
might not bind Judge
Henry to pay salaries.

1582
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1583
01:25:18,659 --> 01:25:21,817
A push came through the
train from forward.

1584
01:25:21,817 --> 01:25:26,750
We were slowing for the Rawhide station,
and all began to be busy and to talk.

1585
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,590
“Going up to the mines today?”

1586
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,172
“Oh, let’s grub first.”

1587
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:31,933
“Guess it’s too late, anyway.”

1588
01:25:31,933 --> 01:25:37,653
And so forth; while they rolled and roped
their bedding, and put on their coats

1589
01:25:37,653 --> 01:25:41,401
with a good deal of elbow motion,
and otherwise showed off.

1590
01:25:41,401 --> 01:25:42,470
It was wasted.

1591
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:46,637
The Virginian did not know what was going
on in the caboose.

1592
01:25:46,637 --> 01:25:52,118
He was leaning and looking out ahead,
and Scipio’s puzzled eye never left him.

1593
01:25:52,118 --> 01:25:55,644
And as we halted for the water-tank,
the Southerner exclaimed,

1594
01:25:55,644 --> 01:25:57,180
“They ’ain’t got away yet!”

1595
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:59,813
as if it were good news to him.

1596
01:25:59,813 --> 01:26:02,916
He meant the delayed trains.

1597
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:07,638
Four stalled expresses were in front of
us, besides several freights.

1598
01:26:07,638 --> 01:26:11,430
And two hours more at least before the
bridge would be ready.

1599
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:16,344
Travellers stood and sat about forlorn,
near the cars, out in

1600
01:26:16,344 --> 01:26:19,979
the sagebrush, anywhere.

1601
01:26:19,979 --> 01:26:25,486
People in hats and spurs watched them,
and Indian chiefs offered them painted

1602
01:26:25,486 --> 01:26:28,788
bows and arrows and shiny horns.

1603
01:26:28,788 --> 01:26:33,330
“I reckon them passengers would prefer a
laig o’ mutton,” said the Virginian to a

1604
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:35,391
man loafing near the caboose.

1605
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:36,447
“Bet your life!”

1606
01:26:36,447 --> 01:26:37,357
said the man.

1607
01:26:37,357 --> 01:26:40,224
“First lot has been stuck here four days.”

1608
01:26:40,224 --> 01:26:41,673
“Plumb starved, ain’t they?”

1609
01:26:41,673 --> 01:26:43,125
inquired the Virginian.

1610
01:26:43,125 --> 01:26:44,263
“Bet your life!

1611
01:26:44,263 --> -1:59:59,000
They’ve eat up their dining cars and
they’ve eat up this town.

1612
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1613
01:26:47,482 --> 01:26:51,605
“Well,” said the Virginian,
looking at the town,

1614
01:26:51,605 --> 01:26:56,386
“I expaict the dining-
cyars contained more nourishment.”

1615
01:26:56,386 --> 01:26:59,040
“Say, you’re about right there!”

1616
01:26:59,040 --> 01:26:59,731
said the man.

1617
01:26:59,731 --> 01:27:04,432
He walked beside the caboose as we puffed
slowly forward from the water-

1618
01:27:04,432 --> 01:27:05,712
tank to our siding.

1619
01:27:05,712 --> 01:27:10,400
“Fine business here if we’d only
been ready,” he continued.

1620
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:14,206
“And the Crow agent has let his Indians
come over from the reservation.

1621
01:27:14,206 --> 01:27:18,714
There has been a little beef brought in,
and game, and fish.

1622
01:27:18,714 --> 01:27:22,849
And big money in it, bet your life!

1623
01:27:22,849 --> 01:27:26,289
Them Eastern passengers
has just been robbed.

1624
01:27:26,289 --> -1:59:59,000
I wisht I had somethin’ to sell!

1625
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1626
01:27:28,369 --> 01:27:31,567
“Anything starting for
Rawhide this afternoon?”

1627
01:27:31,567 --> 01:27:34,505
said Trampas, out of the caboose door.

1628
01:27:34,505 --> 01:27:37,018
“Not until morning,” said the man.

1629
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:38,546
“You going to the mines?”

1630
01:27:38,546 --> 01:27:40,382
he resumed to the Virginian.

1631
01:27:40,382 --> 01:27:45,220
“Why,” answered the Southerner,
slowly and casually,

1632
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:50,716
and addressing himself strictly to the
man, while Trampas, on his side,

1633
01:27:50,716 --> 01:27:56,108
paid obvious inattention,
“this hyeh delay, yu’ see,

1634
01:27:56,108 --> 01:27:59,173
may unsettle our plans some.

1635
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:03,290
But it’ll be one of two ways⁠—we’re all
goin’ to Rawhide, or we’re

1636
01:28:03,290 --> 01:28:04,718
all goin’ to Billings.

1637
01:28:04,718 --> 01:28:06,631
We’re all one party, yu’ see.”

1638
01:28:06,631 --> 01:28:10,431
Trampas laughed audibly inside the door
as he rejoined his men.

1639
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:14,444
“Let him keep up appearances,”
I heard him tell them.

1640
01:28:14,444 --> 01:28:17,154
“It don’t hurt us what
he says to strangers.”

1641
01:28:17,154 --> 01:28:21,239
“But I’m goin’ to eat hearty either
way,” continued the Virginian.

1642
01:28:21,239 --> 01:28:23,118
“And I ain’ goin’ to be robbed.

1643
01:28:23,118 --> -1:59:59,000
I’ve been kind o’ promisin’ myself a
treat if we stopped hyeh.

1644
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1645
01:28:26,796 --> 01:28:29,906
“Town’s eat clean out,” said the man.

1646
01:28:29,906 --> 01:28:31,852
“So yu’ tell me.

1647
01:28:31,852 --> 01:28:35,904
But all you folks has forgot one source
of revenue that yu’ have right

1648
01:28:35,904 --> 01:28:38,080
close by, mighty handy.

1649
01:28:38,080 --> -1:59:59,000
If you have got a gunny sack,
I’ll show you how to make some money.

1650
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1651
01:28:42,893 --> 01:28:43,973
“Bet your life!”

1652
01:28:43,973 --> 01:28:45,036
said the man.

1653
01:28:45,036 --> 01:28:45,893
“Mr.

1654
01:28:45,893 --> 01:28:50,098
Le Moyne,” said the Virginian,
“the outfit’s cookin’ stuff is aboard,

1655
01:28:50,098 --> 01:28:56,071
and if you’ll get the fire ready,
we’ll try how frawgs’ laigs go fried.”

1656
01:28:56,071 --> 01:29:00,034
He walked off at once,
the man following like a dog.

1657
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:04,033
Inside the caboose rose
a gust of laughter.

1658
01:29:04,033 --> 01:29:05,164
“Frogs!”

1659
01:29:05,164 --> 01:29:06,893
muttered Scipio.

1660
01:29:06,893 --> 01:29:12,242
And then turning a blank
face to me, “Frogs?”

1661
01:29:12,242 --> 01:29:18,077
“Colonel Cyrus Jones had them on his bill
of fare,” I said.

1662
01:29:18,077 --> -1:59:59,000
“ ‘Frogs’ legs à la Delmonico.’

1663
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1664
01:29:23,605 --> 01:29:25,058
“Shoo!

1665
01:29:25,058 --> 01:29:27,910
I didn’t get up that thing.

1666
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:29,677
They had it when I came.

1667
01:29:29,677 --> 01:29:31,272
Never looked at it.

1668
01:29:31,272 --> 01:29:32,450
Frogs?”

1669
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:35,873
He went down the steps very slowly,
with a long frown.

1670
01:29:35,873 --> 01:29:38,712
Reaching the ground, he shook his head.

1671
01:29:38,712 --> 01:29:42,794
“That man’s trail is surely hard
to anticipate,” he said.

1672
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:44,934
“But I must hurry up that fire.

1673
01:29:44,934 --> 01:29:48,169
For his appearance has given me
encouragement,” Scipio

1674
01:29:48,169 --> 01:29:50,560
concluded, and became brisk.

1675
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,644
Shorty helped him, and I brought wood.

1676
01:29:54,644 --> 01:30:01,219
Trampas and the other people strolled off
to the station, a compact band.

1677
01:30:01,219 --> 01:30:05,517
Our little fire was built beside the
caboose, so the cooking things might be

1678
01:30:05,517 --> 01:30:07,326
easily reached and put back.

1679
01:30:07,326 --> 01:30:14,462
You would scarcely think such operations
held any interest, even for the hungry,

1680
01:30:14,462 --> 01:30:16,778
when there seemed to be nothing to cook.

1681
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:22,983
A few sticks blazing tamely in the dust,
a frying-pan, half a tin bucket of lard,

1682
01:30:22,983 --> 01:30:28,434
some water, and barren plates and knives
and forks, and three silent men

1683
01:30:28,434 --> 01:30:29,674
attending to them⁠—that

1684
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:30,274
was all.

1685
01:30:30,274 --> 01:30:33,487
But the travellers came to see.

1686
01:30:33,487 --> 01:30:38,602
These waifs drew near us,
and stood, a sad, lone,

1687
01:30:38,602 --> 01:30:44,073
shifting fringe of audience;
four to begin with; and then two

1688
01:30:44,073 --> 01:30:47,876
wandered away; and presently one of
these came back, finding

1689
01:30:47,876 --> 01:30:49,176
it worse elsewhere.

1690
01:30:49,176 --> 01:30:50,495
“Supper, boys?”

1691
01:30:50,495 --> 01:30:51,382
said he.

1692
01:30:51,382 --> 01:30:54,340
“Breakfast,” said Scipio, crossly.

1693
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:57,019
And no more of them addressed us.

1694
01:30:57,019 --> 01:31:00,311
I heard them joylessly mention Wall
Street to each other,

1695
01:31:00,311 --> 01:31:05,134
and Saratoga; I even heard the name Bryn
Mawr, which is near Philadelphia.

1696
01:31:05,134 --> 01:31:09,139
But these fragments of home dropped in
the wilderness here in Montana beside a

1697
01:31:09,139 --> 01:31:12,472
freight caboose were of no
interest to me now.

1698
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:15,838
“Looks like frogs down
there, too,” said Scipio.

1699
01:31:15,838 --> 01:31:18,275
“See them marshy sloos full of weeds?”

1700
01:31:18,275 --> 01:31:21,983
We took a little turn and had a sight of
the Virginian quite active

1701
01:31:21,983 --> 01:31:23,103
among the ponds.

1702
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:23,783
“Hush!

1703
01:31:23,783 --> 01:31:26,798
I’m getting some thoughts,”
continued Scipio.

1704
01:31:26,798 --> 01:31:29,383
“He wasn’t sorry enough.

1705
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:34,244
Don’t interrupt me.”

1706
01:31:34,244 --> 01:31:37,235
“I’m not,” said I.

1707
01:31:37,235 --> 01:31:38,341
“No.

1708
01:31:38,341 --> 01:31:40,236
But I’d ’most caught ahold.”

1709
01:31:40,236 --> 01:31:43,879
And Scipio muttered to himself again,
“He wasn’t sorry enough.”

1710
01:31:43,879 --> 01:31:46,916
Presently he swore loud and brilliantly.

1711
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:47,807
“Tell yu’!”

1712
01:31:47,807 --> 01:31:48,692
he cried.

1713
01:31:48,692 --> 01:31:53,452
“What did he say to Trampas after that
play they exchanged over railroad

1714
01:31:53,452 --> 01:31:57,369
improvements and Trampas put
the josh on him?

1715
01:31:57,369 --> 01:32:01,734
Didn’t he say, ‘Trampas,
I thought you’d be afraid to do it?’

1716
01:32:01,734 --> 01:32:04,753
Well, sir, Trampas had
better have been afraid.

1717
01:32:04,753 --> 01:32:05,755
And that’s what he meant.

1718
01:32:05,755 --> 01:32:07,582
There’s where he was bringin’ it to.

1719
01:32:07,582 --> 01:32:10,829
Trampas made an awful bad play then.

1720
01:32:10,829 --> 01:32:11,713
You wait.

1721
01:32:11,713 --> 01:32:13,858
Glory, but he’s a knowin’ man!

1722
01:32:13,858 --> 01:32:15,441
Course he wasn’t sorry.

1723
01:32:15,441 --> 01:32:19,353
I guess he had the hardest kind of work
to look as sorry as he did.

1724
01:32:19,353 --> 01:32:20,802
You wait.”

1725
01:32:20,802 --> 01:32:21,288
“Wait?

1726
01:32:21,288 --> 01:32:22,297
What for?

1727
01:32:22,297 --> 01:32:23,784
Go on, man!

1728
01:32:23,784 --> 01:32:24,617
What for?”

1729
01:32:24,617 --> 01:32:25,537
“I don’t know!

1730
01:32:25,537 --> 01:32:26,826
I don’t know!

1731
01:32:26,826 --> 01:32:30,671
Whatever hand he’s been holdin’ up,
this is the showdown.

1732
01:32:30,671 --> 01:32:35,237
He’s played for a showdown here before
the caboose gets off the bridge.

1733
01:32:35,237 --> 01:32:37,917
Come back to the fire,
or Shorty’ll be leavin’ it go out.

1734
01:32:37,917 --> 01:32:40,398
Grow happy some, Shorty!”

1735
01:32:40,398 --> 01:32:42,731
he cried on arriving,
and his hand cracked

1736
01:32:42,731 --> 01:32:43,872
on Shorty’s shoulder.

1737
01:32:43,872 --> 01:32:45,789
“Supper’s in sight, Shorty.

1738
01:32:45,789 --> -1:59:59,000
Food for reflection.

1739
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1740
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:49,883
“None for the stomach?”

1741
01:32:49,883 --> 01:32:52,810
asked the passenger who
had spoken once before.

1742
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:55,415
“We’re figuring on that too,” said Scipio.

1743
01:32:55,415 --> 01:33:01,490
His crossness had melted entirely away.

1744
01:33:02,302 --> 01:33:05,366
“Why, they’re cowboys!”

1745
01:33:05,366 --> 01:33:07,958
exclaimed another passenger;
and he moved nearer.

1746
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:13,516
From the station Trampas now came back,
his herd following him less compactly.

1747
01:33:13,516 --> 01:33:17,557
They had found famine,
and no hope of supplies until the next

1748
01:33:17,557 --> 01:33:18,786
train from the East.

1749
01:33:18,786 --> 01:33:22,148
This was no fault of Trampas’s;
but they were following

1750
01:33:22,148 --> 01:33:23,775
him less compactly.

1751
01:33:23,775 --> 01:33:28,212
They carried one piece of cheese,
the size of a fist, the weight of a

1752
01:33:28,212 --> 01:33:31,205
brick, the hue of a corpse.

1753
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:35,833
And the passengers, seeing it,
exclaimed, “There’s Old Faithful again!”

1754
01:33:35,833 --> 01:33:37,748
and took off their hats.

1755
01:33:37,748 --> 01:33:41,190
“You gentlemen met that
cheese before, then?”

1756
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:43,292
said Scipio, delighted.

1757
01:33:43,292 --> 01:33:48,947
“It’s been offered me three times a day
for four days,” said the passenger.

1758
01:33:48,947 --> 01:33:52,145
“Did he want a dollar or a
dollar and a half?”

1759
01:33:52,145 --> 01:33:53,819
“Two dollars!”

1760
01:33:53,819 --> 01:33:55,453
blurted out the enthusiast.

1761
01:33:55,453 --> 01:34:00,491
And all of us save Trampas fell into
fits of imbecile laughter.

1762
01:34:00,491 --> 01:34:04,885
“Here comes our grub,
anyway,” said Scipio,

1763
01:34:04,885 --> 01:34:06,985
looking off toward the marshes.

1764
01:34:06,985 --> 01:34:10,432
And his hilarity sobered away in a moment.

1765
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:13,859
“Well, the train will be
in soon,” stated Trampas.

1766
01:34:13,859 --> 01:34:16,756
“I guess we’ll get a decent
supper without frogs.”

1767
01:34:16,756 --> 01:34:19,374
All interest settled now
upon the Virginian.

1768
01:34:19,374 --> 01:34:23,690
He was coming with his man and his gunny
sack, and the gunny sack hung from his

1769
01:34:23,690 --> 01:34:26,930
shoulder heavily, as a full sack should.

1770
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:31,652
He took no notice of the gathering,
but sat down and partly emptied the

1771
01:34:31,652 --> 01:34:32,192
sack.

1772
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:38,075
“There,” said he, very businesslike,
to his assistant, “that’s all we’ll

1773
01:34:38,075 --> 01:34:38,946
want.

1774
01:34:38,946 --> 01:34:42,404
I think you’ll find a ready
market for the balance.”

1775
01:34:42,404 --> 01:34:44,800
“Well, my gracious!”

1776
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,919
said the enthusiast.

1777
01:34:45,919 --> 01:34:47,586
“What fool eats a frog?”

1778
01:34:47,586 --> -1:59:59,000
“Oh, I’m fool enough for a tadpole

1779
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
!”

1780
01:34:50,444 --> 01:34:51,399
cried the passenger.

1781
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:53,856
And they began to take
out their pocketbooks.

1782
01:34:53,856 --> 01:35:01,292
“You can cook yours right hyeh,
gentlemen,” said the Virginian,

1783
01:35:01,292 --> 01:35:04,317
with his slow Southern courtesy.

1784
01:35:04,317 --> 01:35:07,277
“The dining-cyars don’t look like
they were fired up.”

1785
01:35:07,277 --> 01:35:09,283
“How much will you sell a couple for?”

1786
01:35:09,283 --> 01:35:10,749
inquired the enthusiast.

1787
01:35:10,749 --> 01:35:13,593
The Virginian looked at
him with friendly surprise.

1788
01:35:13,593 --> 01:35:15,572
“Why, help yourself!

1789
01:35:15,572 --> 01:35:17,578
We’re all together yet awhile.

1790
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:23,584
Help yourselves,” he repeated,
to Trampas and his followers.

1791
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:27,741
These hung back a moment,
then, with a slinking motion,

1792
01:35:27,741 --> 01:35:31,241
set the cheese upon the earth and came
forward nearer the fire

1793
01:35:31,241 --> 01:35:32,378
to receive some supper.

1794
01:35:32,378 --> 01:35:36,983
“It won’t scarcely be Delmonico style,”
said the Virginian to the passengers,

1795
01:35:36,983 --> 01:35:39,248
“nor yet Saynt Augustine.”

1796
01:35:39,248 --> 01:35:44,245
He meant the great Augustin,
the traditional chef of Philadelphia,

1797
01:35:44,245 --> 01:35:50,016
whose history I had sketched for him at
Colonel Cyrus Jones’s eating palace.

1798
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:53,678
Scipio now officiated.

1799
01:35:53,678 --> 01:35:57,592
His frying-pan was busy,
and prosperous odors rose from it.

1800
01:35:57,592 --> 01:36:00,739
“Run for a bucket of fresh water,
Shorty,” the Virginian

1801
01:36:00,739 --> 01:36:03,044
continued, beginning his meal.

1802
01:36:03,044 --> 01:36:06,015
“Colonel, yu’ cook pretty near good.

1803
01:36:06,015 --> -1:59:59,000
If yu’ had sold ’em as advertised,
yu’d have cert’nly made a name.

1804
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1805
01:36:10,422 --> 01:36:15,554
Several were now eating with
satisfaction, but not Scipio.

1806
01:36:15,554 --> 01:36:18,026
It was all that he could
do to cook straight.

1807
01:36:18,026 --> 01:36:20,330
The whole man seemed to glisten.

1808
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:24,418
His eye was shut to a slit once more,
while the innocent passengers

1809
01:36:24,418 --> 01:36:25,988
thankfully swallowed.

1810
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:30,790
“Now, you see, you have made some money,”
began the Virginian to the native who

1811
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:33,111
had helped him get the frogs.

1812
01:36:33,111 --> 01:36:34,001
“Bet your life!”

1813
01:36:34,001 --> 01:36:35,566
exclaimed the man.

1814
01:36:35,566 --> 01:36:36,684
“Divvy, won’t you?”

1815
01:36:36,684 --> 01:36:38,431
And he held out half his gains.

1816
01:36:38,431 --> 01:36:40,895
“Keep ’em,” returned the Southerner.

1817
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:42,306
“I reckon we’re square.

1818
01:36:42,306 --> 01:36:45,287
But I expaict they’ll
not equal Delmonico’s, seh?”

1819
01:36:45,287 --> 01:36:46,745
he said to a passenger.

1820
01:36:46,745 --> 01:36:50,072
“Don’t trust the judgment of a man as
hungry as I am!”

1821
01:36:50,072 --> 01:36:52,146
exclaimed the traveller, with a laugh.

1822
01:36:52,146 --> 01:36:56,585
And he turned to his fellow-travellers.

1823
01:36:56,585 --> 01:37:01,486
“Did you ever enjoy supper at
Delmonico’s more than this?”

1824
01:37:01,486 --> 01:37:02,167
“Never!”

1825
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:03,209
they sighed.

1826
01:37:03,209 --> 01:37:08,053
“Why, look here,” said the traveller,
“what fools the people of this town are!

1827
01:37:08,053 --> 01:37:14,400
Here we’ve been all these starving days,
and you come and get ahead of them!”

1828
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:19,292
“That’s right easy explained,”
said the Virginian.

1829
01:37:19,292 --> 01:37:23,435
“I’ve been where there was big money in
frawgs, and they ’ain’t been.

1830
01:37:23,435 --> 01:37:25,118
They’re all cattle hyeh.

1831
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:29,630
Talk cattle, think cattle,
and they’re bankrupt in consequence.

1832
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:31,790
Fallen through.

1833
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:32,931
Ain’t that so?”

1834
01:37:32,931 --> 01:37:34,510
he inquired of the native.

1835
01:37:34,510 --> 01:37:36,640
“That’s about the way,” said the man.

1836
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:39,505
“It’s mighty hard to do what your
neighbors ain’t doin’,”

1837
01:37:39,505 --> 01:37:40,680
pursued the Virginian.

1838
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:44,132
“Montana is all cattle,
an’ these folks must be cattle,

1839
01:37:44,132 --> 01:37:48,211
an’ never notice the country right hyeh
is too small for a range,

1840
01:37:48,211 --> -1:59:59,000
an’ swampy, anyway, an’ just waitin’ to
be a frawg ranch.

1841
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1842
01:37:52,567 --> 01:37:55,071
At this, all wore a face
of careful reserve.

1843
01:37:55,071 --> 01:37:59,613
“I’m not claimin’ to be smarter than you
folks hyeh,” said the Virginian,

1844
01:37:59,613 --> 01:38:01,990
deprecatingly, to his assistant.

1845
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:07,134
“But travellin’ learns a man many customs.

1846
01:38:07,134 --> 01:38:11,447
You wouldn’t do the business they done at
Tulare, California, north

1847
01:38:11,447 --> 01:38:12,340
side o’ the lake.

1848
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:18,235
They cert’nly utilized
them hopeless swamps splendid.

1849
01:38:18,235 --> 01:38:23,386
Of course they put up big capital and
went into it scientific,

1850
01:38:23,386 --> 01:38:27,366
gettin’ advice from the government Fish
Commission, an’ suchlike knowledge.

1851
01:38:27,366 --> 01:38:32,684
Yu’ see, they had big markets for their
frawgs⁠—San Francisco,

1852
01:38:32,684 --> 01:38:37,199
Los Angeles, and clear to New York afteh
the Southern Pacific was through.

1853
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:42,644
But up hyeh yu’ could sell to passengers
every day like yu’ done this one day.

1854
01:38:42,644 --> 01:38:44,961
They would get to know yu’ along the line.

1855
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:47,666
Competing swamps are scarce.

1856
01:38:47,666 --> 01:38:51,307
The dining-cyars would take your frawgs,
and yu’ would have the Yellowstone Park

1857
01:38:51,307 --> 01:38:52,990
for four months in the year.

1858
01:38:52,990 --> 01:38:57,697
Them hotels are anxious to please,
an’ they would buy off yu’ what their

1859
01:38:57,697 --> 01:39:00,617
Eastern patrons esteem as fine-eatin’.

1860
01:39:00,617 --> 01:39:03,634
And you folks would be sellin’
something instead o’ nothin’.”

1861
01:39:03,634 --> 01:39:06,297
“That’s a practical idea,”
said a traveller.

1862
01:39:06,297 --> 01:39:08,180
“And little cost.”

1863
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:11,495
“And little cost,” said the Virginian.

1864
01:39:11,495 --> 01:39:13,533
“Would Eastern people eat frogs?”

1865
01:39:13,533 --> 01:39:14,716
inquired the man.

1866
01:39:14,716 --> 01:39:16,789
“Look at us!”

1867
01:39:16,789 --> 01:39:18,189
said the traveller.

1868
01:39:18,189 --> 01:39:21,351
“Delmonico doesn’t give yu’ such a treat!”

1869
01:39:21,351 --> 01:39:22,493
said the Virginian.

1870
01:39:22,493 --> 01:39:23,652
“Not exactly!”

1871
01:39:23,652 --> 01:39:25,214
the traveller exclaimed.

1872
01:39:25,214 --> 01:39:28,126
“How much would be paid for frogs?”

1873
01:39:28,126 --> 01:39:29,741
said Trampas to him.

1874
01:39:29,741 --> 01:39:33,844
And I saw Scipio bend
closer to his cooking.

1875
01:39:33,844 --> 01:39:36,260
“Oh, I don’t know,” said the traveller.

1876
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:38,284
“We’ve paid pretty well, you see.”

1877
01:39:38,284 --> 01:39:42,768
“You’re late for Tulare,
Trampas,” said the Virginian.

1878
01:39:42,768 --> 01:39:46,720
“I was not thinking of
Tulare,” Trampas retorted.

1879
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:50,553
Scipio’s nose was in the frying-pan.

1880
01:39:50,553 --> 01:39:53,022
“Mos’ comical spot you ever struck!”

1881
01:39:53,022 --> 01:39:56,558
said the Virginian, looking round
upon the whole company.

1882
01:39:56,558 --> 01:40:00,663
He allowed himself a broad
smile of retrospect.

1883
01:40:00,663 --> 01:40:02,683
“To hear ’em talk frawgs at Tulare!

1884
01:40:02,683 --> 01:40:06,333
Same as other folks talks hawsses or
steers or whatever they’re

1885
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:07,417
raising to sell.

1886
01:40:07,417 --> 01:40:11,425
Yu’d fall into it yourselves if
yu’ started the business.

1887
01:40:11,425 --> 01:40:15,116
Anything a man’s bread and butter depends
on, he’s going to be earnest about.

1888
01:40:15,116 --> 01:40:17,160
Don’t care if it is a frawg.”

1889
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:18,818
“That’s so,” said the native.

1890
01:40:18,818 --> 01:40:20,138
“And it paid good?”

1891
01:40:20,138 --> 01:40:23,102
“The only money in the county was right
there,” answered the Virginian.

1892
01:40:23,102 --> 01:40:27,959
“It was a dead county,
and only frawgs was movin’.

1893
01:40:27,959 --> 01:40:31,599
But that business was a-fannin’ to beat
four of a kind.

1894
01:40:31,599 --> 01:40:35,020
It made yu’ feel strange at
first, as I said.

1895
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:38,577
For all the men had been cattlemen at
one time or another.

1896
01:40:38,577 --> 01:40:42,165
Till yu’ got accustomed,
it would give ’most anybody a shock to

1897
01:40:42,165 --> 01:40:45,591
hear ’em speak about herdin’ the bulls
in a pasture by themselves.”

1898
01:40:45,591 --> 01:40:50,191
The Virginian allowed himself another
smile, but became serious again.

1899
01:40:50,191 --> 01:40:53,652
“That was their policy,” he explained.

1900
01:40:53,652 --> 01:40:58,973
“Except at certain times o’ year they
kept the bulls separate.

1901
01:40:58,973 --> 01:41:01,956
The Fish Commission told ’em they’d
better, and it cert’nly

1902
01:41:01,956 --> 01:41:03,328
worked mighty well.

1903
01:41:03,328 --> 01:41:06,833
It or something did⁠—for, gentlemen, hush!

1904
01:41:06,833 --> 01:41:08,979
but there was millions.

1905
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:14,539
You’d have said all the frawgs in the
world had taken charge at Tulare.

1906
01:41:14,539 --> 01:41:16,601
And the money rolled in!

1907
01:41:16,601 --> 01:41:18,323
Gentlemen, hush!

1908
01:41:18,323 --> 01:41:20,853
’twas a gold mine for the owners.

1909
01:41:20,853 --> 01:41:24,435
Forty percent they netted some years.

1910
01:41:24,435 --> 01:41:27,155
And they paid generous wages.

1911
01:41:27,155 --> 01:41:32,737
For they could sell to all them French
restaurants in San Francisco, yu’ see.

1912
01:41:32,737 --> 01:41:34,508
And there was the Cliff House.

1913
01:41:34,508 --> 01:41:37,778
And the Palace Hotel made it a specialty.

1914
01:41:37,778 --> 01:41:41,501
And the officers took frawgs at the
Presidio, an’ Angel Island,

1915
01:41:41,501 --> 01:41:43,969
an’ Alcatraz, an’ Benicia.

1916
01:41:43,969 --> 01:41:47,510
Los Angeles was beginnin’ its boom.

1917
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:51,592
The corner-lot sharps wanted something
by way of varnish.

1918
01:41:51,592 --> 01:41:58,490
An’ so they dazzled Eastern investors
with advertisin’ Tulare frawgs clear to

1919
01:41:58,490 --> 01:42:00,880
New Orleans an’ New York.

1920
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:05,466
’Twas only in Sacramento frawgs was dull.

1921
01:42:05,466 --> 01:42:09,385
I expaict the California legislature was
too or’n’ry for them

1922
01:42:09,385 --> 01:42:11,210
fine-raised luxuries.

1923
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:16,067
They tell of one of them senators that he
raked a million out of Los Angeles real

1924
01:42:16,067 --> 01:42:19,747
estate, and started in for a bang-
up meal with champagne.

1925
01:42:19,747 --> 01:42:23,202
Wanted to scatter his new
gold thick an’ quick.

1926
01:42:23,202 --> 01:42:28,017
But he got astray among all the fancy
dishes, an’ just yelled right out before

1927
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:29,645
the ladies, ‘Damn it!

1928
01:42:29,645 --> 01:42:32,364
bring me forty dollars’ worth
of ham and aiggs.’

1929
01:42:32,364 --> 01:42:33,861
He was a funny senator, now.”

1930
01:42:33,861 --> 01:42:36,586
The Virginian paused,
and finished eating a leg.

1931
01:42:36,586 --> 01:42:41,960
And then with diabolic art he made a
feint at wandering to

1932
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,777
new fields of anecdote.

1933
01:42:43,777 --> 01:42:48,548
“Talkin’ of senators,”
he resumed, “Senator Wise⁠—”

1934
01:42:48,548 --> 01:42:52,069
“How much did you say
wages were at Tulare?”

1935
01:42:52,069 --> 01:42:54,212
inquired one of the Trampas faction.

1936
01:42:54,212 --> 01:42:55,263
“How much?

1937
01:42:55,263 --> 01:42:57,629
Why, I never knew what the foreman got.

1938
01:42:57,629 --> 01:42:59,680
The regular hands got a hundred.

1939
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:01,000
Senator Wise⁠—”

1940
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,081
“A hundred a month?”

1941
01:43:02,081 --> 01:43:08,712
“Why, it was wet an’ muddy work, yu’ see.

1942
01:43:08,712 --> 01:43:13,181
A man risked rheumatism some.

1943
01:43:13,181 --> 01:43:14,660
He risked it a good deal.

1944
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:18,262
Well, I was going to tell
about Senator Wise.

1945
01:43:18,262 --> 01:43:21,603
When Senator Wise was speaking of
his visit to Alaska⁠—”

1946
01:43:21,603 --> 01:43:22,921
“Forty percent, was it?”

1947
01:43:22,921 --> 01:43:23,730
said Trampas.

1948
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:26,650
“Oh, I must call my wife,”
said the traveller behind me.

1949
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:28,333
“This is what I came West for.”

1950
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:29,569
And he hurried away.

1951
01:43:29,569 --> 01:43:32,625
“Not forty percent the bad years

1952
01:43:32,625 --> 01:43:34,277
,” replied the Virginian.

1953
01:43:34,277 --> 01:43:38,042
“The frawgs had enemies, same as cattle.

1954
01:43:38,042 --> 01:43:41,599
I remember when a pelican got in the
spring pasture, and the herd

1955
01:43:41,599 --> 01:43:43,171
broke through the fence⁠—”

1956
01:43:43,171 --> 01:43:44,603
“Fence?”

1957
01:43:44,603 --> 01:43:45,816
said a passenger.

1958
01:43:45,816 --> 01:43:47,950
“Ditch, seh, and wire net.

1959
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:52,286
Every pasture was a square swamp with a
ditch around, and a wire net.

1960
01:43:52,286 --> 01:43:55,206
Yu’ve heard the mournful,
mixed-up sound a big bunch

1961
01:43:55,206 --> 01:43:56,708
of cattle will make?

1962
01:43:56,708 --> 01:44:01,726
Well, seh, as yu’ druv from the railroad
to the Tulare frawg ranch yu’ could

1963
01:44:01,726 --> 01:44:03,027
hear ’em a mile.

1964
01:44:03,027 --> 01:44:08,027
Springtime they’d sing like girls in the
organ loft, and by August they were

1965
01:44:08,027 --> 01:44:10,717
about ready to hire out for bass.

1966
01:44:10,717 --> 01:44:13,757
And all was fit to be soloists,
if I’m a judge.

1967
01:44:13,757 --> 01:44:18,967
But in a bad year it might
only be twenty percent.

1968
01:44:18,967 --> 01:44:23,122
The pelican rushed ’em from the pasture
right into the San Joaquin River,

1969
01:44:23,122 --> 01:44:25,269
which was close by the property.

1970
01:44:25,269 --> 01:44:29,102
The big balance of the herd stampeded,
and though of course they came out on

1971
01:44:29,102 --> 01:44:34,395
the banks again, the news had went
around, and folks below at Hemlen eat

1972
01:44:34,395 --> 01:44:36,509
most of ’em just to spite the company.

1973
01:44:36,509 --> 01:44:40,789
Yu’ see, a frawg in a river is more
hopeless than any maverick

1974
01:44:40,789 --> 01:44:42,235
loose on the range.

1975
01:44:42,235 --> -1:59:59,000
And they never struck any plan to brand
their stock and prove ownership.

1976
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1977
01:44:47,278 --> 01:44:51,426
“Well, twenty percent is good enough for
me,” said Trampas, “if

1978
01:44:51,426 --> 01:44:53,226
Rawhide don’t suit me.”

1979
01:44:53,226 --> 01:44:54,666
“A hundred a month!”

1980
01:44:54,666 --> 01:44:55,768
said the enthusiast.

1981
01:44:55,768 --> 01:45:01,045
And busy calculations began
to arise among them.

1982
01:45:01,045 --> 01:45:04,116
“It went to fifty percent,”
pursued the Virginian,

1983
01:45:04,116 --> 01:45:08,365
“when New York and Philadelphia got to
biddin’ agaynst each other.

1984
01:45:08,365 --> 01:45:13,710
Both cities had signs all over ’em
claiming to furnish the Tulare frawg.

1985
01:45:13,710 --> 01:45:15,876
And both had ’em all right.

1986
01:45:15,876 --> 01:45:19,881
And same as cattle trains,
yu’d see frawg trains tearing acrosst

1987
01:45:19,881 --> 01:45:24,331
Arizona⁠—big glass tanks with wire over
’em⁠—through to New York,

1988
01:45:24,331 --> 01:45:26,075
an’ the frawgs starin’ out.”

1989
01:45:26,075 --> 01:45:34,761
“Why, George,” whispered a woman’s voice
behind me, “he’s merely deceiving them!

1990
01:45:34,761 --> 01:45:37,663
He’s merely making that stuff up
out of his head.”

1991
01:45:37,663 --> 01:45:39,621
“Yes, my dear, that’s
merely what he’s doing.”

1992
01:45:39,621 --> 01:45:43,006
“Well, I don’t see why you imagined I
should care for this.

1993
01:45:43,006 --> 01:45:44,507
I think I’ll go back.”

1994
01:45:44,507 --> 01:45:46,009
“Better see it out, Daisy.

1995
01:45:46,009 --> 01:45:51,242
This beats the geysers or anything we’re
likely to find in the Yellowstone.”

1996
01:45:51,242 --> 01:45:56,027
“Then I wish we had gone to Bar Harbor as
usual,” said the lady,

1997
01:45:56,027 --> 01:45:57,341
and she returned to her Pullman.

1998
01:45:57,341 --> 01:45:58,854
But her husband stayed.

1999
01:45:58,854 --> 01:46:04,450
Indeed, the male crowd now was a goodly
sight to see, how the men edged close,

2000
01:46:04,450 --> 01:46:06,201
drawn by a common tie.

2001
01:46:06,201 --> 01:46:11,754
Their different kinds of feet told the
strength of the bond⁠—yellow sleeping-

2002
01:46:11,754 --> 01:46:18,106
car slippers planted miscellaneous and
motionless near a pair of Mexican spurs.

2003
01:46:18,106 --> 01:46:22,674
All eyes watched the Virginian and gave
him their entire sympathy.

2004
01:46:22,674 --> 01:46:26,346
Though they could not know his motive for
it, what he was doing had fallen as

2005
01:46:26,346 --> 01:46:30,367
light upon them⁠—all
except the excited calculators.

2006
01:46:30,367 --> 01:46:34,727
These were loudly making their fortunes
at both Rawhide and Tulare,

2007
01:46:34,727 --> 01:46:38,887
drugged by their satanically aroused
hopes of gold, heedless of the

2008
01:46:38,887 --> 01:46:40,949
slippers and the spurs.

2009
01:46:40,949 --> 01:46:45,160
Had a man given any sign to warn them,
I think he would have been lynched.

2010
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:50,715
Even the Indian chiefs had come to see in
their show war bonnets and blankets.

2011
01:46:50,715 --> 01:46:55,987
They naturally understood nothing of it,
yet magnetically knew that the Virginian

2012
01:46:55,987 --> 01:46:57,592
was the great man.

2013
01:46:57,592 --> 01:47:00,068
And they watched him with approval.

2014
01:47:00,068 --> 01:47:04,594
He sat by the fire with the frying-pan,
looking his daily self⁠—

2015
01:47:04,594 --> 01:47:06,915
engaging and saturnine.

2016
01:47:06,915 --> 01:47:13,199
And now as Trampas declared tickets to
California would be dear and Rawhide had

2017
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:18,456
better come first, the Southerner let
loose his heaven-born imagination.

2018
01:47:18,456 --> 01:47:22,285
“There’s a better reason for Rawhide than
tickets, Trampas,” said he.

2019
01:47:22,285 --> 01:47:24,431
“I said it was too late for Tulare.”

2020
01:47:24,431 --> 01:47:26,882
“I heard you,” said Trampas.

2021
01:47:26,882 --> 01:47:28,402
“Opinions may differ.

2022
01:47:28,402 --> 01:47:31,148
You and I don’t think
alike on several points.”

2023
01:47:31,148 --> 01:47:32,981
“Gawd, Trampas!”

2024
01:47:32,981 --> 01:47:37,695
said the Virginian, “d’ yu’ reckon I’d be
rotting hyeh on forty dollars if Tulare

2025
01:47:37,695 --> 01:47:39,295
was like it used to be?

2026
01:47:39,295 --> 01:47:40,537
Tulare is broke.”

2027
01:47:40,537 --> 01:47:41,404
“What broke it?

2028
01:47:41,404 --> 01:47:42,403
Your leaving?”

2029
01:47:42,403 --> 01:47:46,648
“Revenge broke it, and disease,”
said the Virginian, striking the frying-

2030
01:47:46,648 --> 01:47:50,006
pan on his knee, for the
frogs were all gone.

2031
01:47:50,006 --> 01:47:55,810
At those lurid words their untamed child
minds took fire, and they drew round him

2032
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:58,494
again to hear a tale of blood.

2033
01:47:58,494 --> 01:48:00,543
The crowd seemed to lean nearer.

2034
01:48:00,543 --> 01:48:04,703
But for a short moment it
threatened to be spoiled.

2035
01:48:04,703 --> 01:48:08,758
A passenger came along,
demanding in an important voice,

2036
01:48:08,758 --> 01:48:10,379
“Where are these frogs?”

2037
01:48:10,379 --> 01:48:14,906
He was a prominent New York after-dinner
speaker, they whispered me,

2038
01:48:14,906 --> 01:48:17,925
and out for a holiday in his private
car.

2039
01:48:17,925 --> 01:48:23,400
Reaching us and walking to the Virginian,
he said cheerily, “How much do you want

2040
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,276
for your frogs, my friend?”

2041
01:48:25,276 --> 01:48:26,695
“You got a friend hyeh?”

2042
01:48:26,695 --> 01:48:27,863
said the Virginian.

2043
01:48:27,863 --> 01:48:30,513
“That’s good, for yu’ need
care taken of yu’.”

2044
01:48:30,513 --> 01:48:34,444
And the prominent after-dinner speaker
did not further discommode us.

2045
01:48:34,444 --> 01:48:38,312
“That’s worth my trip,”
whispered a New York passenger to me.

2046
01:48:38,312 --> 01:48:43,660
“Yes, it was a case of revenge,”
resumed the Virginian, “and disease.

2047
01:48:43,660 --> 01:48:48,568
There was a man named Saynt Augustine got
run out of Domingo, which

2048
01:48:48,568 --> 01:48:50,009
is a Dago island.

2049
01:48:50,009 --> 01:48:52,728
He come to Philadelphia,
an’ he was dead broke.

2050
01:48:52,728 --> 01:48:56,648
But Saynt Augustine was a live man,
an’ he saw Philadelphia was full o’

2051
01:48:56,648 --> 01:48:59,048
Quakers that dressed
plain an’ eat humdrum.

2052
01:48:59,048 --> 01:49:03,099
So he started cookin’ Domingo way for
’em, an’ they caught right ahold.

2053
01:49:03,099 --> 01:49:07,613
Terrapin, he gave ’em,
an’ croakeets, an’ he’d use forty

2054
01:49:07,613 --> 01:49:10,492
chickens to make a broth
he called consommay.

2055
01:49:10,492 --> 01:49:14,554
An’ he got rich, and Philadelphia got
well known, an’ Delmonico in New

2056
01:49:14,554 --> 01:49:16,216
York he got jealous.

2057
01:49:16,216 --> -1:59:59,000
He was the cook that had the say-
so in New York.

2058
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2059
01:49:19,217 --> 01:49:23,589
“Was Delmonico one of them I-talians?”

2060
01:49:23,589 --> 01:49:27,083
inquired a fascinated mutineer.

2061
01:49:27,083 --> 01:49:28,088
“I don’t know.

2062
01:49:28,088 --> 01:49:30,160
But he acted like one.

2063
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:33,146
Lorenzo was his front name.

2064
01:49:33,146 --> 01:49:34,323
He aimed to cut⁠—”

2065
01:49:34,323 --> 01:49:35,723
“Domingo’s throat?”

2066
01:49:35,723 --> 01:49:37,344
breathed the enthusiast.

2067
01:49:37,344 --> 01:49:42,464
“Aimed to cut away the trade from Saynt
Augustine an’ put Philadelphia back

2068
01:49:42,464 --> 01:49:44,090
where he thought she belonged.

2069
01:49:44,090 --> 01:49:46,763
Frawgs was the fashionable rage then.

2070
01:49:46,763 --> 01:49:49,764
These foreign cooks set the fashion in
eatin’, same as foreign

2071
01:49:49,764 --> 01:49:52,695
dressmakers do women’s clothes.

2072
01:49:52,695 --> 01:49:56,560
Both cities was catchin’ and swallowin’
all the frawgs Tulare could throw at

2073
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:57,176
’em.

2074
01:49:57,176 --> 01:49:57,880
So he⁠—”

2075
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:58,997
“Lorenzo?”

2076
01:49:58,997 --> 01:50:00,314
said the enthusiast.

2077
01:50:00,314 --> 01:50:03,462
“Yes, Lorenzo Delmonico.

2078
01:50:03,462 --> 01:50:05,480
He bid a dollar a tank higher.

2079
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:10,035
An’ Saynt Augustine raised
him fifty cents.

2080
01:50:10,035 --> 01:50:12,661
An’ Lorenzo raised him a dollar.

2081
01:50:12,661 --> 01:50:16,325
An’ Saynt Augustine shoved her up three.

2082
01:50:16,325 --> 01:50:20,210
Lorenzo he didn’t expect Philadelphia
would go that high, and he got hot in

2083
01:50:20,210 --> 01:50:25,691
the collar, an’ flew round his kitchen
in New York, an’ claimed he’d twist

2084
01:50:25,691 --> 01:50:30,564
Saynt Augustine’s Domingo tail for him
and crack his ossified system.

2085
01:50:30,564 --> 01:50:34,229
Lorenzo raised his language to a
high temperature, they say.

2086
01:50:34,229 --> 01:50:38,355
An’ then quite sudden off
he starts for Tulare.

2087
01:50:38,355 --> 01:50:43,960
He buys tickets over the Santa Fe,
and he goes a-fannin’ and a-foggin’.

2088
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:46,073
But, gentlemen, hush!

2089
01:50:46,073 --> 01:50:50,637
The very same day Saynt Augustine he
tears out of Philadelphia.

2090
01:50:50,637 --> 01:50:55,466
He travelled by the way o’ Washington,
an’ out he comes a-fannin’ an’ a-foggin’

2091
01:50:55,466 --> 01:50:56,973
over the Southern Pacific.

2092
01:50:56,973 --> 01:51:00,257
Of course Tulare didn’t
know nothin’ of this.

2093
01:51:00,257 --> 01:51:04,383
All it knowed was how the frawg market
was on soarin’ wings,

2094
01:51:04,383 --> 01:51:06,819
and it was feelin’ like
a flight o’ rawckets.

2095
01:51:06,819 --> 01:51:13,340
If only there’d been some preparation⁠—a
telegram or something⁠—the disaster

2096
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:14,980
would never have occurred.

2097
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:20,434
But Lorenzo and Saynt Augustine was that
absorbed watchin’ each other⁠—for,

2098
01:51:20,434 --> 01:51:26,723
yu’ see, the Santa Fe and the Southern
Pacific come together at Mojave,

2099
01:51:26,723 --> 01:51:31,360
an’ the two cooks travelled a matter of
two hundred an’ ten miles in the same

2100
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:34,763
cyar⁠—they never thought
about a telegram.

2101
01:51:34,763 --> 01:51:39,364
And when they arruv, breathless,
an’ started in to screechin’ what they’d

2102
01:51:39,364 --> 01:51:44,366
give for the monopoly,
why, them unsuspectin’ Tulare boys

2103
01:51:44,366 --> 01:51:45,872
got amused at ’em.

2104
01:51:45,872 --> 01:51:50,216
I never heard just all they done,
but they had Lorenzo singin’ and

2105
01:51:50,216 --> 01:51:54,709
dancin’, while Saynt Augustine played
the fiddle for him.

2106
01:51:54,709 --> 01:51:58,603
And one of Lorenzo’s heels did
get a trifle grazed.

2107
01:51:58,603 --> 01:52:04,283
Well, them two cooks quit that ranch
without disclosin’ their identity,

2108
01:52:04,283 --> 01:52:08,825
and soon as they got to a safe distance
they swore eternal friendship,

2109
01:52:08,825 --> 01:52:10,551
in their excitable foreign way.

2110
01:52:10,551 --> 01:52:14,519
And they went home over the Union
Pacific, sharing the same stateroom.

2111
01:52:14,519 --> 01:52:17,570
Their revenge killed frawgs.

2112
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:18,768
The disease⁠—”

2113
01:52:18,768 --> 01:52:20,942
“How killed frogs?”

2114
01:52:20,942 --> 01:52:23,413
demanded Trampas.

2115
01:52:23,413 --> 01:52:25,013
“Just killed ’em.

2116
01:52:25,013 --> 01:52:30,289
Delmonico and Saynt Augustine wiped
frawgs off the slate of fashion.

2117
01:52:30,289 --> 01:52:34,045
Not a banker in Fifth Avenue’ll touch one
now if another banker’s

2118
01:52:34,045 --> 01:52:35,125
around watchin’ him.

2119
01:52:35,125 --> 01:52:39,985
And if ever yu’ see a man that hides his
feet an’ won’t take off his socks in

2120
01:52:39,985 --> 01:52:44,378
company, he has worked in them Tulare
swamps an’ got the disease.

2121
01:52:44,378 --> 01:52:47,427
Catch him wadin’, and yu’ll
find he’s web-footed.

2122
01:52:47,427 --> -1:59:59,000
Frawgs are dead, Trampas, and so are you.

2123
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2124
01:52:50,890 --> 01:52:54,480
“Rise up, liars, and salute your king!”

2125
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:55,758
yelled Scipio.

2126
01:52:55,758 --> 01:52:57,985
“Oh, I’m in love with you!”

2127
01:52:57,985 --> 01:53:00,288
And he threw his arms round the Virginian.

2128
01:53:00,288 --> 01:53:05,172
“Let me shake hands with you,”
said the traveller, who had failed to

2129
01:53:05,172 --> 01:53:07,410
interest his wife in these things.

2130
01:53:07,410 --> 01:53:09,834
“I wish I was going to have
more of your company.”

2131
01:53:09,834 --> 01:53:12,647
“Thank yu’, seh,” said the Virginian.

2132
01:53:12,647 --> 01:53:15,570
Other passengers greeted him,
and the Indian chiefs

2133
01:53:15,570 --> 01:53:17,517
came, saying, “How!”

2134
01:53:17,517 --> 01:53:19,993
because they followed
their feelings without understanding.

2135
01:53:19,993 --> 01:53:23,810
“Don’t show so humbled,
boys,” said the deputy foreman to

2136
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:25,295
his most sheepish crew.

2137
01:53:25,295 --> 01:53:30,156
“These gentlemen from the East have been
enjoying yu’ some, I know.

2138
01:53:30,156 --> 01:53:33,334
But think what a weary wait
they have had hyeh.

2139
01:53:33,334 --> 01:53:39,041
And you insisted on playing the game with
me this way, yu’ see.

2140
01:53:39,041 --> 01:53:41,513
What outlet did yu’ give me?

2141
01:53:41,513 --> 01:53:43,078
Didn’t I have it to do?

2142
01:53:43,078 --> 01:53:46,475
And I’ll tell yu’ one thing for your
consolation: when I got to the middle of

2143
01:53:46,475 --> 01:53:48,905
the frawgs I ’most believed it myself.”

2144
01:53:48,905 --> 01:53:52,540
And he laughed out the first laugh I
had heard him give.

2145
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:55,142
The enthusiast came up and shook hands.

2146
01:53:55,142 --> 01:54:00,042
That led off, and the rest followed,
with Trampas at the end.

2147
01:54:00,042 --> 01:54:02,971
The tide was too strong for him.

2148
01:54:02,971 --> 01:54:05,802
He was not a graceful loser;
but he got through this,

2149
01:54:05,802 --> 01:54:09,282
and the Virginian eased him down by
treating him precisely

2150
01:54:09,282 --> 01:54:11,743
like the others⁠—apparently.

2151
01:54:11,743 --> 01:54:16,456
Possibly the supreme⁠—the most American⁠—
moment of all was when word came that the

2152
01:54:16,456 --> 01:54:20,692
bridge was open, and the Pullman trains,
with noise and triumph,

2153
01:54:20,692 --> 01:54:22,928
began to move westward at last.

2154
01:54:22,928 --> 01:54:29,298
Everyone waved farewell to everyone,
craning from steps and windows,

2155
01:54:29,298 --> 01:54:33,050
so that the cars twinkled with hilarity;
and in twenty minutes the whole

2156
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:36,106
procession in front had moved,
and our turn came.

2157
01:54:36,106 --> 01:54:39,092
“Last chance for Rawhide,”
said the Virginian.

2158
01:54:39,092 --> 01:54:43,750
“Last chance for Sunk Creek,”
said a reconstructed mutineer,

2159
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:45,353
and all sprang aboard.

2160
01:54:45,353 --> 01:54:48,957
There was no question who had
won his spurs now.

2161
01:54:48,957 --> 01:54:54,821
Our caboose trundled on to Billings along
the shingly cotton-wooded Yellowstone;

2162
01:54:54,821 --> 01:55:00,154
and as the plains and bluffs and the
distant snow began to grow well known,

2163
01:55:00,154 --> 01:55:04,086
even to me, we turned to our baggage
that was to come off,

2164
01:55:04,086 --> 01:55:09,592
since camp would begin in the morning.

2165
01:55:12,525 --> 01:55:16,327
Thus I saw the Virginian carefully
rewrapping Kenilworth,

2166
01:55:16,327 --> 01:55:20,173
that he might bring it to its owner
unharmed; and I said,

2167
01:55:20,173 --> 01:55:23,582
“Don’t you think you could have played
poker with Queen Elizabeth?”

2168
01:55:23,582 --> 01:55:28,537
“No; I expaict she’d have
beat me,” he replied.

2169
01:55:28,537 --> 01:55:29,729
“She was a lady.”

2170
01:55:29,729 --> 01:55:33,808
It was at Billings, on this day,
that I made those reflections

2171
01:55:33,808 --> 01:55:34,982
about equality.

2172
01:55:34,982 --> 01:55:39,049
For the Virginian had been equal to the
occasion: that is the only kind of

2173
01:55:39,049 --> 01:55:41,748
equality which I recognize.

2174
01:55:41,748 --> 01:55:42,961
CHAPTER XVII

2175
01:55:42,961 --> 01:55:44,420
Scipio Moralizes

2176
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:48,156
Into what mood was it that
the Virginian now fell?

2177
01:55:48,156 --> 01:55:52,736
Being less busy, did he begin to “grieve”
about the girl on Bear Creek?

2178
01:55:52,736 --> 01:55:56,438
I only know that after talking so
lengthily he fell into

2179
01:55:56,438 --> 01:55:58,087
a nine days’ silence.

2180
01:55:58,087 --> 01:56:02,824
The talking part of him
deeply and unbrokenly slept.

2181
01:56:02,824 --> 01:56:07,112
Official words of course came from him as
we rode southward from the railroad,

2182
01:56:07,112 --> 01:56:09,453
gathering the Judge’s stray cattle.

2183
01:56:09,453 --> 01:56:14,094
During the many weeks since the spring
roundup, some of these animals had as

2184
01:56:14,094 --> 01:56:23,347
usual got very far off their range,
and getting them on again became the

2185
01:56:23,347 --> 01:56:26,267
present business of our party.

2186
01:56:26,267 --> 01:56:31,252
Directions and commands⁠—whatever
communications to his subordinates were

2187
01:56:31,252 --> 01:56:34,944
needful to the forwarding of
this⁠—he duly gave.

2188
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:41,632
But routine has never at any time of the
world passed for conversation.

2189
01:56:41,632 --> 01:56:46,244
His utterances, such as,
“We’ll work Willo’ Creek tomorro’

2190
01:56:46,244 --> 01:56:50,523
mawnin’,” or, “I want the wagon to be at
the fawks o’ Stinkin’ Water by

2191
01:56:50,523 --> 01:56:55,736
Thursday,” though on some occasions
numerous enough to sound like discourse,

2192
01:56:55,736 --> 01:56:58,611
never once broke the man’s true silence.

2193
01:56:58,611 --> 01:57:04,350
Seeming to keep easy company with the
camp, he yet kept altogether to himself.

2194
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:09,510
That talking part of him⁠—the mood which
brings out for you your friend’s spirit

2195
01:57:09,510 --> 01:57:16,370
and mind as a free gift or as an
exchange⁠—was down in some dark cave of

2196
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:18,608
his nature, hidden away.

2197
01:57:18,608 --> 01:57:22,749
Perhaps it had been dreaming;
perhaps completely reposing.

2198
01:57:22,749 --> 01:57:26,573
The Virginian was one of those rare ones
who are able to refresh

2199
01:57:26,573 --> 01:57:29,487
themselves in sections.

2200
01:57:29,487 --> 01:57:33,991
To have a thing on his mind did not keep
his body from resting.

2201
01:57:33,991 --> 01:57:38,391
During our recent journey⁠—it felt years
ago now!⁠—while our caboose on the

2202
01:57:38,391 --> 01:57:42,591
freight train had trundled endlessly
westward, and the men were on the ragged

2203
01:57:42,591 --> 01:57:48,029
edge, the very jumping-off place,
of mutiny and possible murder,

2204
01:57:48,029 --> 01:57:53,390
I had seen him sleep like a child.

2205
01:57:53,390 --> 01:57:56,745
He snatched the moments
not necessary for vigil.

2206
01:57:56,745 --> 01:58:00,964
I had also seen him sit all night
watching his responsibility,

2207
01:58:00,964 --> 01:58:03,574
ready to spring on it and fasten
his teeth in it.

2208
01:58:03,574 --> 01:58:10,204
And now that he had confounded them with
their own attempted weapon of ridicule,

2209
01:58:10,204 --> 01:58:13,212
his powers seemed to
be profoundly dormant.

2210
01:58:13,212 --> 01:58:17,551
That final pitched battle of wits had
made the men his captives and

2211
01:58:17,551 --> 01:58:20,723
admirers⁠—all save Trampas.

2212
01:58:20,723 --> 01:58:24,169
And of him the Virginian did not
seem to be aware.

2213
01:58:24,169 --> 01:58:27,844
But Scipio le Moyne would say to me now
and then, “If I was Trampas,

2214
01:58:27,844 --> 01:58:29,295
I’d pull my freight.”

2215
01:58:29,295 --> 01:58:32,365
And once he added, “Pull it kind of
casual, yu’ know, like I wasn’t

2216
01:58:32,365 --> -1:59:59,000
noticing myself do it.

2217
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2218
01:58:33,956 --> 01:58:40,089
“Yes,” our friend Shorty murmured
pregnantly, with his eye upon the quiet

2219
01:58:40,089 --> 01:58:44,067
Virginian, “he’s sure
studying his revenge.”

2220
01:58:44,067 --> 01:58:46,895
“Studying your pussycat,” said Scipio.

2221
01:58:46,895 --> 01:58:49,015
“He knows what he’ll do.

2222
01:58:49,015 --> 01:58:50,436
The time ain’t arrived.”

2223
01:58:50,436 --> 01:58:53,835
This was the way they felt about it;
and not unnaturally this was the way

2224
01:58:53,835 --> 01:58:57,174
they made me, the inexperienced
Easterner, feel about it.

2225
01:58:57,174 --> 01:59:02,433
That Trampas also felt something about it
was easy to know.

2226
01:59:02,433 --> 01:59:08,276
Like the leaven which leavens the whole
lump, one spot of sulkiness in camp will

2227
01:59:08,276 --> 01:59:12,049
spread its dull flavor through any
company that sits near it;

2228
01:59:12,049 --> 01:59:16,439
and we had to sit near Trampas at
meals for nine days.

2229
01:59:16,439 --> 01:59:18,132
His sullenness was not wonderful.

2230
01:59:18,132 --> 01:59:23,259
To feel himself forsaken by his recent
adherents, to see them gone over to his

2231
01:59:23,259 --> 01:59:26,828
enemy, could not have
made his reflections pleasant.

2232
01:59:26,828 --> 01:59:32,240
Why he did not take himself off to other
climes⁠—“pull his freight casual,”

2233
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:37,955
as Scipio said⁠—I can explain only thus:
pay was due him⁠—“time,”

2234
01:59:37,955 --> 01:59:42,590
as it was called in cow-land;
if he would have this money,

2235
01:59:42,590 --> 01:59:47,131
he must stay under the Virginian’s
command until the Judge’s ranch on Sunk

2236
01:59:47,131 --> 01:59:51,824
Creek should be reached;
meanwhile, each day’s work added to the

2237
01:59:51,824 --> 01:59:56,491
wages in store for him;
and finally, once at Sunk Creek,

2238
01:59:56,491 --> 01:59:59,885
it would be no more the Virginian who
commanded him; it would be

2239
01:59:59,885 --> 02:00:01,445
the real ranch foreman.

2240
02:00:01,445 --> 02:00:05,405
At the ranch he would be the Virginian’s
equal again, both of them taking orders

2241
02:00:05,405 --> 02:00:09,014
from their officially
recognized superior, this foreman.

2242
02:00:09,014 --> 02:00:14,863
Shorty’s word about “revenge” seemed to
me like putting the thing backwards.

2243
02:00:14,863 --> 02:00:20,508
Revenge, as I told Scipio,
was what I should be thinking about

2244
02:00:20,508 --> 02:00:22,236
if I were Trampas.

2245
02:00:22,236 --> 02:00:26,680
“He dassent,” was Scipio’s immediate view.

2246
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:29,458
“Not till he’s got strong again.

2247
02:00:29,458 --> 02:00:33,961
He got laughed plumb sick by the
bystanders, and whatever spirit he had

2248
02:00:33,961 --> 02:00:36,159
was broke in the presence of us all.

2249
02:00:36,159 --> 02:00:37,431
He’ll have to recuperate.”

2250
02:00:37,431 --> 02:00:40,111
Scipio then spoke of the
Virginian’s attitude.

2251
02:00:40,111 --> 02:00:44,071
“Maybe revenge ain’t just the right word
for where this affair has got

2252
02:00:44,071 --> 02:00:45,079
to now with him.

2253
02:00:45,079 --> 02:00:49,270
When yu’ beat another man at his own game
like he done to Trampas,

2254
02:00:49,270 --> 02:00:53,115
why, yu’ve had all the revenge yu’ can
want, unless you’re a hog.

2255
02:00:53,115 --> 02:00:54,349
And he’s no hog.

2256
02:00:54,349 --> 02:00:56,337
But he has got it in for Trampas.

2257
02:00:56,337 --> 02:00:58,385
They’ve not reckoned to a finish.

2258
02:00:58,385 --> 02:01:02,438
Would you let a man try such spite-work
on you and quit thinkin’ about him just

2259
02:01:02,438 --> 02:01:03,870
because yu’d headed him off?”

2260
02:01:03,870 --> 02:01:07,747
To this I offered his own notion about
hogs and being satisfied.

2261
02:01:07,747 --> 02:01:09,249
“Hogs!”

2262
02:01:09,249 --> 02:01:13,529
went on Scipio, in a way that dashed my
suggestion to pieces;

2263
02:01:13,529 --> 02:01:16,729
“hogs ain’t in the case.

2264
02:01:16,729 --> 02:01:21,601
He’s got to deal with Trampas
somehow⁠—man to man.

2265
02:01:21,601 --> 02:01:32,228
Trampas and him can’t stay this way when
they get back and go workin’ same

2266
02:01:32,228 --> 02:01:35,428
as they worked before.

2267
02:01:35,428 --> 02:01:40,331
No, sir; I’ve seen his eye twice,
and I know he’s goin’ to

2268
02:01:40,331 --> -1:59:59,000
reckon to a finish.

2269
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2270
02:01:41,571 --> 02:01:46,346
I still must, in Scipio’s opinion,
have been slow to understand,

2271
02:01:46,346 --> 02:01:50,513
when on the afternoon following this
talk I invited him to tell me what sort

2272
02:01:50,513 --> 02:01:55,257
of “finish” he wanted,
after such a finishing as had

2273
02:01:55,257 --> 02:01:58,038
been dealt Trampas already.

2274
02:01:58,038 --> 02:02:02,810
Getting “laughed plumb sick by the
bystanders” (I borrowed his own not

2275
02:02:02,810 --> 02:02:08,145
overstated expression) seemed to me
a highly final finishing.

2276
02:02:08,145 --> 02:02:12,638
While I was running my notions off to
him, Scipio rose, and,

2277
02:02:12,638 --> 02:02:16,917
with the frying-pan he had been washing,
walked slowly at me.

2278
02:02:16,917 --> 02:02:21,210
“I do believe you’d oughtn’t to be let
travel alone the way you do.”

2279
02:02:21,210 --> 02:02:23,169
He put his face close to mine.

2280
02:02:23,169 --> 02:02:28,579
His long nose grew eloquent in its
shrewdness, while the fire in his

2281
02:02:28,579 --> 02:02:31,533
bleached blue eye burned
with amiable satire.

2282
02:02:31,533 --> 02:02:35,853
“What has come and gone between them two
has only settled the one point he

2283
02:02:35,853 --> 02:02:37,238
was aimin’ to make.

2284
02:02:37,238 --> 02:02:41,279
He was appointed boss of this outfit in
the absence of the regular foreman.

2285
02:02:41,279 --> 02:02:45,893
Since then all he has been playin’ for is
to hand back his men to the ranch in as

2286
02:02:45,893 --> 02:02:49,774
good shape as they’d been handed to him,
and without losing any on the road

2287
02:02:49,774 --> 02:02:52,884
through desertion or shooting or
whatnot.

2288
02:02:52,884 --> 02:02:56,604
He had to kick his cook off the train
that day, and the loss made him

2289
02:02:56,604 --> 02:02:58,335
sorrowful, I could see.

2290
02:02:58,335 --> 02:03:02,249
But I’d happened to come along,
and he jumped me into the vacancy,

2291
02:03:02,249 --> 02:03:04,683
and I expect he is pretty near consoled.

2292
02:03:04,683 --> 02:03:08,854
And as boss of the outfit he beat
Trampas, who was settin’

2293
02:03:08,854 --> 02:03:10,534
up for opposition boss.

2294
02:03:10,534 --> 02:03:14,214
And the outfit is better than satisfied
it come out that way,

2295
02:03:14,214 --> 02:03:17,414
and they’re stayin’ with him;
and he’ll hand them all back in good

2296
02:03:17,414 --> 02:03:21,149
condition, barrin’ that lost cook.

2297
02:03:21,149 --> 02:03:24,249
So for the present his point
is made, yu’ see.

2298
02:03:24,249 --> 02:03:25,655
But look ahead a little.

2299
02:03:25,655 --> 02:03:29,083
It may not be so very far ahead
yu’ll have to look.

2300
02:03:29,083 --> 02:03:30,869
We get back to the ranch.

2301
02:03:30,869 --> 02:03:32,959
He’s not boss there any more.

2302
02:03:32,959 --> 02:03:35,478
His responsibility is over.

2303
02:03:35,478 --> 02:03:39,299
He is just one of us again,
taking orders from a foreman they tell

2304
02:03:39,299 --> 02:03:43,198
me has showed partiality to Trampas
more’n a few times.

2305
02:03:43,198 --> 02:03:44,503
Partiality!

2306
02:03:44,503 --> 02:03:47,923
That’s what Trampas is
plainly trusting to.

2307
02:03:47,923 --> 02:03:52,332
Trusting it will fix him all right and
fix his enemy all wrong.

2308
02:03:52,332 --> 02:03:56,716
He’d not otherwise dare to keep
sour like he’s doing.

2309
02:03:56,716 --> 02:03:58,114
Partiality!

2310
02:03:58,114 --> 02:04:00,125
D’ yu’ think it’ll scare off the enemy?”

2311
02:04:00,125 --> 02:04:04,065
Scipio looked across a little creek to
where the Virginian was helping throw

2312
02:04:04,065 --> 02:04:06,565
the gathered cattle on the bedground.

2313
02:04:06,565 --> 02:04:14,892
“What odds”⁠—he pointed the frying-pan at
the Southerner⁠—“d’ yu’ figure Trampas’s

2314
02:04:14,892 --> 02:04:19,092
being under any foreman’s wing will make
to a man like him?

2315
02:04:19,092 --> 02:04:23,208
He’s going to remember Mr. Trampas and
his spite-work if he’s got to tear him

2316
02:04:23,208 --> 02:04:25,568
out from under the wing,
and maybe tear off the

2317
02:04:25,568 --> 02:04:26,876
wing in the operation.

2318
02:04:26,876 --> 02:04:30,798
And I am goin’ to advise your folks,”
ended the complete Scipio,

2319
02:04:30,798 --> -1:59:59,000
“not to leave you travel so much alone⁠—
not till you’ve learned more life

2320
-1:59:59,000 --> -1:59:59,000
.

2321
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2322
02:04:35,828 --> 02:04:41,077
He had made me feel my inexperience,
convinced me of innocence,

2323
02:04:41,077 --> 02:04:46,652
undoubtedly; and during the final days
of our journey I no longer invoked his

2324
02:04:46,652 --> 02:04:52,508
aid to my reflections upon this especial
topic: What would the

2325
02:04:52,508 --> 02:04:55,444
Virginian do to Trampas?

2326
02:04:55,444 --> 02:04:59,838
Would it be another intellectual crushing
of him, like the frog story,

2327
02:04:59,838 --> 02:05:03,828
or would there be something this time
more material⁠—say muscle,

2328
02:05:03,828 --> 02:05:06,005
or possibly gunpowder⁠—in it?

2329
02:05:06,005 --> 02:05:09,725
And was Scipio, after all, infallible?

2330
02:05:09,725 --> 02:05:14,239
I didn’t pretend to understand the
Virginian; after several years’

2331
02:05:14,239 --> 02:05:18,442
knowledge of him he remained
utterly beyond me.

2332
02:05:18,442 --> 02:05:23,168
Scipio’s experience was not
yet three weeks long.

2333
02:05:23,168 --> 02:05:27,982
So I let him alone as to all this,
discussing with him most other things

2334
02:05:27,982 --> 02:05:31,022
good and evil in the world,
and being convinced of much further

2335
02:05:31,022 --> 02:05:38,651
innocence; for Scipio’s twenty odd years
were indeed a library of life.

2336
02:05:38,651 --> 02:05:44,495
I have never met a better heart,
a shrewder wit, and looser morals,

2337
02:05:44,495 --> 02:05:50,767
with yet a native sense of decency and
duty somewhere hard and fast enshrined.

2338
02:05:50,767 --> 02:05:54,912
But all the while I was wondering about
the Virginian: eating with him,

2339
02:05:54,912 --> 02:05:58,911
sleeping with him (only not so sound as
he did), and riding beside him

2340
02:05:58,911 --> 02:06:00,743
often for many hours.

2341
02:06:00,743 --> 02:06:04,351
Experiments in conversation I
did make⁠—and failed.

2342
02:06:04,351 --> 02:06:09,174
One day particularly while,
after a sudden storm of hail had chilled

2343
02:06:09,174 --> 02:06:14,796
the earth numb and white like winter in
fifteen minutes, we sat drying and

2344
02:06:14,796 --> 02:06:19,747
warming ourselves by a fire that we
built, I touched upon that theme of

2345
02:06:19,747 --> 02:06:25,458
equality on which I knew him to hold
opinions as strong as mine.

2346
02:06:25,458 --> 02:06:30,845
“Oh,” he would reply,
and “Cert’nly”; and when I asked him

2347
02:06:30,845 --> 02:06:34,995
what it was in a man that made him a
leader of men, he shook his head

2348
02:06:34,995 --> 02:06:36,075
and puffed his pipe.

2349
02:06:36,075 --> 02:06:41,409
So then, noticing how the sun had brought
the earth in half an hour back from

2350
02:06:41,409 --> 02:06:44,809
winter to summer again,
I spoke of our American climate.

2351
02:06:44,809 --> 02:06:47,689
It was a potent drug,
I said, for millions to

2352
02:06:47,689 --> 02:06:49,169
be swallowing every day.

2353
02:06:49,169 --> 02:06:54,797
“Yes,” said he, wiping the damp
from his Winchester rifle.

2354
02:06:54,797 --> 02:06:59,293
Our American climate,
I said, had worked remarkable

2355
02:06:59,293 --> 02:07:01,174
changes, at least.

2356
02:07:01,174 --> 02:07:04,379
“Yes,” he said; and did not
ask what they were.

2357
02:07:04,379 --> 02:07:06,164
So I had to tell him.

2358
02:07:06,164 --> 02:07:11,293
“It has made successful
politicians of the Irish.

2359
02:07:11,293 --> 02:07:12,669
That’s one.

2360
02:07:12,669 --> 02:07:17,595
And it has given our whole race
the habit of poker.”

2361
02:07:17,595 --> 02:07:19,488
Bang went his Winchester.

2362
02:07:19,488 --> 02:07:21,878
The bullet struck close to my left.

2363
02:07:21,878 --> 02:07:24,298
I sat up angrily.

2364
02:07:24,298 --> 02:07:26,963
“That’s the first foolish thing I
ever saw you do!”

2365
02:07:26,963 --> 02:07:28,099
I said.

2366
02:07:28,099 --> 02:07:31,789
“Yes,” he drawled slowly,
“I’d ought to have done it sooner.

2367
02:07:31,789 --> 02:07:33,608
He was pretty near lively again.”

2368
02:07:33,608 --> 02:07:38,185
And then he picked up a rattlesnake
six feet behind me.

2369
02:07:38,185 --> 02:07:41,915
It had been numbed by the hail,
part revived by the sun,

2370
02:07:41,915 --> 02:07:43,801
and he had shot its head off.

2371
02:07:43,801 --> 02:07:44,980
CHAPTER XVIII

2372
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:46,106
“Would You Be a Parson?”

2373
02:07:46,106 --> 02:07:48,805
After this I gave up my
experiments in conversation.

2374
02:07:48,805 --> 02:07:54,806
So that by the final afternoon of our
journey, with Sunk Creek actually in

2375
02:07:54,806 --> 02:07:59,006
sight, and the great grasshoppers
slatting their dry song over the

2376
02:07:59,006 --> 02:08:04,286
sagebrush, and the time at hand when the
Virginian and Trampas would be “man to

2377
02:08:04,286 --> 02:08:09,535
man,” my thoughts rose to a
considerable pitch of speculation.

2378
02:08:09,535 --> 02:08:13,348
And now that talking part of the
Virginian, which had been nine days

2379
02:08:13,348 --> 02:08:17,155
asleep, gave its first yawn
and stretch of waking.

2380
02:08:17,155 --> 02:08:20,710
Without preface, he suddenly asked me,
“Would you be a parson?”

2381
02:08:20,710 --> 02:08:25,830
I was mentally so far away that I
couldn’t get back in time to comprehend

2382
02:08:25,830 --> 02:08:29,470
or answer before he had repeated:⁠—

2383
02:08:29,470 --> 02:08:33,334
“What would yu’ take to be a parson?”

2384
02:08:33,334 --> 02:08:37,894
He drawled it out in his gentle way,
precisely as if no nine days stood

2385
02:08:37,894 --> 02:08:42,086
between it and our last real
intercourse.

2386
02:08:42,086 --> 02:08:42,626
“Take?”

2387
02:08:42,626 --> 02:08:46,637
I was still vaguely moving in my distance.

2388
02:08:46,637 --> 02:08:47,366
“How?”

2389
02:08:47,366 --> 02:08:49,531
His next question brought me home.

2390
02:08:49,531 --> 02:08:53,141
“I expect the Pope’s is the biggest
of them parson jobs?”

2391
02:08:53,141 --> 02:08:55,299
It was with an “Oh!”

2392
02:08:55,299 --> 02:08:57,409
that I now entirely took his idea.

2393
02:08:57,409 --> 02:09:00,601
“Well, yes; decidedly the biggest.”

2394
02:09:00,601 --> 02:09:02,264
“Beats the English one?

2395
02:09:02,264 --> 02:09:05,124
Archbishop⁠—ain’t it?⁠—of Canterbury?

2396
02:09:05,124 --> 02:09:06,707
The Pope comes ahead of him?”

2397
02:09:06,707 --> 02:09:09,724
“His Holiness would say so if
his Grace did not.”

2398
02:09:09,724 --> 02:09:13,404
The Virginian turned half in his saddle
to see my face⁠—I was,

2399
02:09:13,404 --> 02:09:17,796
at the moment, riding not quite abreast
of him⁠—and I saw the gleam of his

2400
02:09:17,796 --> 02:09:20,229
teeth beneath his mustache.

2401
02:09:20,229 --> 02:09:25,333
It was seldom I could make him smile,
even to this slight extent.

2402
02:09:25,333 --> 02:09:31,067
But his eyes grew, with his next words,
remote again in their speculation.

2403
02:09:31,067 --> 02:09:34,115
“His Holiness and his Grace.

2404
02:09:34,115 --> 02:09:39,583
Now if I was to hear ’em namin’ me that-
a-way every mawnin’, I’d sca’cely

2405
02:09:39,583 --> -1:59:59,000
get down to business.

2406
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2407
02:09:40,884 --> 02:09:42,462
“Oh, you’d get used to the pride of it.”

2408
02:09:42,462 --> 02:09:43,484
“ ’Tisn’t the pride.

2409
02:09:43,484 --> 02:09:45,011
The laugh is what would ruin me.

2410
02:09:45,011 --> 02:09:48,604
’Twould take ’most all my attention
keeping a straight face.

2411
02:09:48,604 --> 02:09:54,347
The Archbishop”⁠—here he took one of his
wide mental turns⁠—“is apt to be a big

2412
02:09:54,347 --> 02:09:56,428
man in them Shakespeare plays.

2413
02:09:56,428 --> 02:10:00,739
Kings take talk from him they’d not stand
from anybody else; and

2414
02:10:00,739 --> 02:10:03,021
he talks fine, frequently.

2415
02:10:03,021 --> 02:10:08,122
About the bees, for instance,
when Henry is going to fight France.

2416
02:10:08,122 --> 02:10:12,570
He tells him a beehive is
similar to a kingdom.

2417
02:10:12,570 --> 02:10:14,200
I learned that piece.”

2418
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:19,133
The Virginian could not have expected to
blush at uttering these last words.

2419
02:10:19,133 --> 02:10:23,352
He knew that his sudden color must tell
me in whose book it was he

2420
02:10:23,352 --> 02:10:24,977
had learned the piece.

2421
02:10:24,977 --> 02:10:29,297
Was not her copy of Kenilworth even now
in his cherishing pocket?

2422
02:10:29,297 --> 02:10:35,276
So he now, to cover his blush,
very deliberately recited to me the

2423
02:10:35,276 --> 02:10:40,156
Archbishop’s discourse upon
bees and their kingdom:⁠—

2424
02:10:40,156 --> 02:10:45,254
“ ‘Where some, like magistrates,
correct at home.

2425
02:10:45,254 --> 02:10:47,106
⋮Others, like soldiers,
armèd in their stings,

2426
02:10:47,106 --> 02:10:50,921
Make loot upon the summer’s velvet buds;
Which pillage they with merry march bring

2427
02:10:50,921 --> 02:10:56,777
homeTo the tent-royal of their
emperor:He, busied in his majesty,

2428
02:10:56,777 --> 02:11:01,817
surveysThe singing masons
building roofs of gold.’

2429
02:11:01,817 --> 02:11:05,489
“Ain’t that a fine description
of bees a-workin’?

2430
02:11:05,489 --> 02:11:08,884
‘The singing masons building
roofs of gold!’

2431
02:11:08,884 --> 02:11:13,211
Puts ’em right before yu’, and is
poetry without bein’ foolish.

2432
02:11:13,211 --> 02:11:15,910
His Holiness and his Grace.

2433
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:19,427
Well, they could not hire me for
either o’ those positions.

2434
02:11:19,427 --> -1:59:59,000
How many religions are there?

2435
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2436
02:11:21,409 --> 02:11:22,462
“All over the earth?”

2437
02:11:22,462 --> 02:11:24,626
“Yu’ can begin with ourselves.

2438
02:11:24,626 --> 02:11:28,594
Right hyeh at home I know
there’s Romanists, and Episcopals⁠—”

2439
02:11:28,594 --> 02:11:30,315
“Two kinds!”

2440
02:11:30,315 --> 02:11:31,015
I put in.

2441
02:11:31,015 --> 02:11:33,453
“At least two of Episcopals.”

2442
02:11:33,453 --> 02:11:34,498
“That’s three.

2443
02:11:34,498 --> 02:11:38,637
Then Methodists and Baptists, and⁠—”

2444
02:11:38,637 --> 02:11:41,545
“Three Methodists!”

2445
02:11:41,545 --> 02:11:43,929
“Well, you do the countin’.”

2446
02:11:43,929 --> 02:11:49,255
I accordingly did it,
feeling my revolving memory slip cogs

2447
02:11:49,255 --> 02:11:50,906
all the way round.

2448
02:11:50,906 --> 02:11:53,624
“Anyhow, there are safely fifteen.”

2449
02:11:53,624 --> 02:11:54,379
“Fifteen.”

2450
02:11:54,379 --> 02:11:56,339
He held this fact a moment.

2451
02:11:56,339 --> 02:12:01,221
“And they don’t worship a whole heap o’
different gods like the ancients did?”

2452
02:12:01,221 --> 02:12:05,461
“Oh, no!”

2453
02:12:05,461 --> 02:12:07,342
“It’s just the same one?”

2454
02:12:07,342 --> 02:12:08,341
“The same one.”

2455
02:12:08,341 --> 02:12:13,642
The Virginian folded his hands over the
horn of his saddle, and leaned forward

2456
02:12:13,642 --> 02:12:19,287
upon them in contemplation of
the wide, beautiful landscape.

2457
02:12:19,287 --> 02:12:21,850
“One God and fifteen religions

2458
02:12:21,850 --> 02:12:23,207
,” was his reflection.

2459
02:12:23,207 --> 02:12:26,761
“That’s a right smart of religions
for just one God.”

2460
02:12:26,761 --> 02:12:32,366
This way of reducing it was,
if obvious to him, so novel to me that

2461
02:12:32,366 --> 02:12:38,269
my laugh evidently struck him as a
louder and livelier comment

2462
02:12:38,269 --> 02:12:40,291
than was required.

2463
02:12:40,291 --> 02:12:45,611
He turned on me as if I had somehow
perverted the spirit of his words.

2464
02:12:45,611 --> 02:12:46,933
“I ain’t religious.

2465
02:12:46,933 --> 02:12:47,804
I know that.

2466
02:12:47,804 --> 02:12:49,586
But I ain’t unreligious.

2467
02:12:49,586 --> 02:12:50,779
And I know that too.”

2468
02:12:50,779 --> 02:12:52,386
“So do I know it, my friend.”

2469
02:12:52,386 --> 02:12:55,865
“Do you think there ought to be fifteen
varieties of good people?”

2470
02:12:55,865 --> 02:13:00,306
His voice, while it now had an edge that
could cut anything it came against,

2471
02:13:00,306 --> 02:13:02,946
was still not raised.

2472
02:13:02,946 --> 02:13:05,337
“There ain’t fifteen.

2473
02:13:05,337 --> 02:13:06,603
There ain’t two.

2474
02:13:06,603 --> 02:13:08,191
There’s one kind.

2475
02:13:08,191 --> 02:13:10,322
And when I meet it, I respect it.

2476
02:13:10,322 --> 02:13:14,900
It is not praying nor preaching that has
ever caught me and made me ashamed of

2477
02:13:14,900 --> 02:13:18,253
myself, but one or two people I have
knowed that never said a

2478
02:13:18,253 --> 02:13:19,693
superior word to me.

2479
02:13:19,693 --> 02:13:23,693
They thought more o’ me than I deserved,
and that made me behave better than

2480
02:13:23,693 --> 02:13:25,156
I naturally wanted to.

2481
02:13:25,156 --> 02:13:29,533
Made me quit a girl onced in time for her
not to lose her good name.

2482
02:13:29,533 --> 02:13:32,783
And so that’s one thing I have never done.

2483
02:13:32,783 --> 02:13:38,090
And if ever I was to have a son or
somebody I set store by,

2484
02:13:38,090 --> 02:13:44,023
I would wish their lot to be to know one
or two good folks mighty well⁠—men

2485
02:13:44,023 --> -1:59:59,000
or women⁠—women preferred.

2486
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2487
02:13:47,079 --> 02:13:51,713
He had looked away again to the hills
behind Sunk Creek ranch,

2488
02:13:51,713 --> 02:13:55,366
to which our walking horses had
now almost brought us.

2489
02:13:55,366 --> 02:13:59,997
“As for parsons”⁠—the gesture of his arm
was a disclaiming one⁠—“I reckon some

2490
02:13:59,997 --> 02:14:02,708
parsons have a right to tell
yu’ to be good.

2491
02:14:02,708 --> 02:14:06,860
The bishop of this hyeh
Territory has a right.

2492
02:14:06,860 --> 02:14:10,663
But I’ll tell yu’ this:
a middlin’ doctor is a pore thing,

2493
02:14:10,663 --> 02:14:14,974
and a middlin’ lawyer is a pore thing;
but keep me from a middlin’ man of God.”

2494
02:14:14,974 --> 02:14:18,531
Once again he had reduced it,
but I did not laugh this time.

2495
02:14:18,531 --> 02:14:25,760
I thought there should in truth be heavy
damages for malpractice on human souls.

2496
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:30,431
But the hot glow of his words,
and the vision of his deepest inner man

2497
02:14:30,431 --> 02:14:33,530
it revealed, faded away abruptly.

2498
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:36,660
“What do yu’ make of the
proposition yondeh?”

2499
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:40,432
As he pointed to the cause of this
question he had become again his

2500
02:14:40,432 --> 02:14:43,685
daily, engaging, saturnine self.

2501
02:14:43,685 --> 02:14:48,400
Then I saw over in a fenced meadow,
to which we were now close,

2502
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:51,096
what he was pleased to
call “the proposition.”

2503
02:14:51,096 --> 02:14:56,944
Proposition in the West does,
in fact, mean whatever you at the moment

2504
02:14:56,944 --> 02:15:01,398
please⁠—an offer to sell you a mine,
a cloudburst, a glass

2505
02:15:01,398 --> 02:15:05,052
of whiskey, a steamboat.

2506
02:15:05,052 --> 02:15:10,904
This time it meant a stranger clad in
black, and of a clerical deportment

2507
02:15:10,904 --> 02:15:16,463
which would in that atmosphere and to a
watchful eye be visible for

2508
02:15:16,463 --> 02:15:17,387
a mile or two.

2509
02:15:17,387 --> 02:15:20,863
“I reckoned yu’ hadn’t noticed him,”
was the Virginian’s reply

2510
02:15:20,863 --> 02:15:22,283
to my ejaculation.

2511
02:15:22,283 --> 02:15:23,188
“Yes.

2512
02:15:23,188 --> 02:15:25,650
He set me goin’ on the
subject a while back.

2513
02:15:25,650 --> -1:59:59,000
I expect he is another missionary
to us pore cowboys.

2514
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2515
02:15:29,566 --> 02:15:36,104
I seemed from a hundred yards to feel
the stranger’s forceful personality.

2516
02:15:36,104 --> 02:15:41,703
It was in his walk⁠—I should better say
stalk⁠—as he promenaded along the creek.

2517
02:15:41,703 --> 02:15:45,598
His hands were behind his back,
and there was an air of waiting,

2518
02:15:45,598 --> 02:15:48,150
of displeased waiting, in his movement.

2519
02:15:48,150 --> 02:15:52,184
“Yes, he’ll be a missionary,”
said the Virginian, conclusively;

2520
02:15:52,184 --> 02:15:55,462
and he took to singing,
or rather to whining,

2521
02:15:55,462 --> 02:15:58,942
with his head tilted at an absurd angle
upward at the sky:⁠—

2522
02:15:58,942 --> 02:16:04,143
“ ‘Dar is a big Car’lina nigger,
About de size of dis chile or p’raps a

2523
02:16:04,143 --> 02:16:08,104
little bigger,By de name of Jim Crow.

2524
02:16:08,104 --> 02:16:11,743
Dat what de white folks call him.

2525
02:16:11,743 --> 02:16:17,175
If ever I sees him I ’tends for to maul
him,Just to let de white folks seeSuch

2526
02:16:17,175 --> -1:59:59,000
an animos as heCan’t walk around the
streets and scandalize me.’

2527
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2528
02:16:22,801 --> 02:16:26,886
The lane which was conducting us to the
group of ranch buildings now turned a

2529
02:16:26,886 --> 02:16:30,631
corner of the meadow,
and the Virginian went on

2530
02:16:30,631 --> 02:16:32,056
with his second verse:⁠—

2531
02:16:32,056 --> 02:16:35,535
“ ‘Great big fool, he
hasn’t any knowledge.

2532
02:16:35,535 --> 02:16:36,372
Gosh!

2533
02:16:36,372 --> 02:16:38,434
how could he, when he’s
never been to scollege?

2534
02:16:38,434 --> -1:59:59,000
Neither has I.But I’se come mighty nigh;
I peaked through de door as I went by.’

2535
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2536
02:16:42,797 --> 02:16:46,546
He was beginning a third stanza,
but stopped short; a horse had

2537
02:16:46,546 --> 02:16:48,177
neighed close behind us.

2538
02:16:48,177 --> 02:16:52,039
“Trampas,” said he, without turning his
head, “we are home.”

2539
02:16:52,039 --> 02:16:53,792
“It looks that way.”

2540
02:16:53,792 --> 02:16:57,232
Some ten yards were between ourselves and
Trampas, where he followed.

2541
02:16:57,232 --> 02:17:01,600
“And I’ll trouble yu’ for my rope yu’
took this mawnin’ instead o’ your own.”

2542
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:05,265
“I don’t know as it’s your rope I’ve got.”

2543
02:17:05,265 --> 02:17:10,393
Trampas skilfully spoke this so that a
precisely opposite meaning

2544
02:17:10,393 --> 02:17:11,940
flowed from his words.

2545
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:15,749
If it was discussion he
tried for, he failed.

2546
02:17:15,749 --> 02:17:19,784
The Virginian’s hand moved,
and for one thick, flashing moment my

2547
02:17:19,784 --> 02:17:23,118
thoughts were evidently also
the thoughts of Trampas.

2548
02:17:23,118 --> 02:17:27,899
But the Virginian only held out to
Trampas the rope which he had

2549
02:17:27,899 --> 02:17:29,502
detached from his saddle.

2550
02:17:29,502 --> 02:17:36,953
“Take your hand off your gun, Trampas.

2551
02:17:36,953 --> 02:17:41,257
If I had wanted to kill yu’ you’d be
lying nine days back on the road now.

2552
02:17:41,257 --> 02:17:42,841
Here’s your rope.

2553
02:17:42,841 --> 02:17:44,659
Did yu’ expect I’d not know it?

2554
02:17:44,659 --> 02:17:48,740
It’s the only one in camp the stiffness
ain’t all drug out of yet.

2555
02:17:48,740 --> -1:59:59,000
Or maybe yu’ expected me to notice
and⁠—not take notice?

2556
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2557
02:17:53,185 --> 02:17:56,597
“I don’t spend my time
in expectations about you.

2558
02:17:56,597 --> 02:17:57,214
If⁠—”

2559
02:17:57,214 --> 02:18:00,476
The Virginian wheeled his
horse across the road.

2560
02:18:00,476 --> 02:18:05,081
“Yu’re talkin’ too soon
after reachin’ safety, Trampas.

2561
02:18:05,081 --> 02:18:09,925
I didn’t tell yu’ to hand me that rope
this mawnin’, because I was busy.

2562
02:18:09,925 --> 02:18:11,274
I ain’t foreman now;

2563
02:18:11,274 --> 02:18:13,298
and I want that rope.”

2564
02:18:13,298 --> 02:18:17,570
Trampas produced a smile as
skilful as his voice.

2565
02:18:17,570 --> 02:18:21,780
“Well, I guess your having mine proves
this one is yours.”

2566
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:25,518
He rode up and received the coil which
the Virginian held out,

2567
02:18:25,518 --> 02:18:27,994
unloosing the disputed one on his
saddle.

2568
02:18:27,994 --> 02:18:33,218
If he had meant to devise a slippery,
evasive insult, no small trick in cow-

2569
02:18:33,218 --> 02:18:37,811
land could be more offensive than this
taking another man’s rope.

2570
02:18:37,811 --> 02:18:43,567
And it is the small tricks which lead
to the big bullets.

2571
02:18:43,567 --> 02:18:49,117
Trampas put a smooth coating of
plausibility over the whole transaction.

2572
02:18:49,117 --> 02:18:52,916
“After the rope corral we had to make
this morning”⁠—his tone was mock

2573
02:18:52,916 --> 02:18:58,283
explanatory⁠—“the ropes was all strewed
round camp, and in the hustle I⁠—”

2574
02:18:58,283 --> 02:19:03,170
“Pardon me,” said a sonorous voice behind
us, “do you happen to

2575
02:19:03,170 --> 02:19:05,676
have seen Judge Henry?”

2576
02:19:05,676 --> 02:19:11,532
It was the reverend gentleman in his
meadow, come to the fence.

2577
02:19:11,532 --> 02:19:18,608
As we turned round to him he spoke on,
with much rotund authority in his eye.

2578
02:19:18,608 --> 02:19:22,866
“From his answer to my letter,
Judge Henry undoubtedly expects me here.

2579
02:19:22,866 --> 02:19:28,460
I have arrived from Fetterman according
to my plan which I announced to him,

2580
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:32,913
to find that he has been absent all
day⁠—absent the whole day.”

2581
02:19:32,913 --> 02:19:39,120
The Virginian sat sidewise to talk,
one long, straight leg supporting him on

2582
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:43,912
one stirrup, the other bent at ease,
the boot half lifted

2583
02:19:43,912 --> 02:19:45,460
from its dangling stirrup.

2584
02:19:45,460 --> 02:19:48,781
He made himself the perfection
of courtesy.

2585
02:19:48,781 --> 02:19:51,903
“The Judge is frequently
absent all night, seh.”

2586
02:19:51,903 --> 02:19:53,663
“Scarcely tonight, I think.

2587
02:19:53,663 --> 02:19:56,001
I thought you might know
something about him.”

2588
02:19:56,001 --> 02:19:58,705
“I have been absent myself, seh.”

2589
02:19:58,705 --> 02:19:59,310
“Ah!

2590
02:19:59,310 --> 02:20:01,466
On a vacation, perhaps?”

2591
02:20:01,466 --> 02:20:03,759
The divine had a ruddy facet.

2592
02:20:03,759 --> 02:20:09,577
His strong glance was straight and frank
and fearless; but his smile too much

2593
02:20:09,577 --> 02:20:14,417
reminded me of days bygone,
when we used to return to school from

2594
02:20:14,417 --> 02:20:18,008
the Christmas holidays,
and the masters would shake our hands

2595
02:20:18,008 --> 02:20:21,476
and welcome us with:
“Robert, John, Edward,

2596
02:20:21,476 --> 02:20:24,273
glad to see you all looking so well!

2597
02:20:24,273 --> 02:20:27,547
Rested, and ready for
hard work, I’m sure!”

2598
02:20:27,547 --> 02:20:31,873
That smile does not really please even
good, tame little boys;

2599
02:20:31,873 --> 02:20:34,026
and the Virginian was nearing thirty.

2600
02:20:34,026 --> 02:20:37,026
“It has not been vacation this trip,
seh,” said he, settling

2601
02:20:37,026 --> 02:20:38,547
straight in his saddle.

2602
02:20:38,547 --> 02:20:42,546
“There’s the Judge driving in now,
in time for all questions yu’

2603
02:20:42,546 --> 02:20:43,401
have to ask him.”

2604
02:20:43,401 --> 02:20:46,456
His horse took a step,
but was stopped short.

2605
02:20:46,456 --> 02:20:49,806
There lay the Virginian’s
rope on the ground.

2606
02:20:49,806 --> 02:20:54,366
I had been aware of Trampas’s quite
proper departure during the talk;

2607
02:20:54,366 --> 02:21:00,030
and as he was leaving,
I seemed also to be aware of his placing

2608
02:21:00,030 --> 02:21:03,649
the coil across the cantle
of its owner’s saddle.

2609
02:21:03,649 --> 02:21:06,350
Had he intended it to fall and have
to be picked up?

2610
02:21:06,350 --> 02:21:10,732
It was another evasive little business,
and quite successful,

2611
02:21:10,732 --> 02:21:13,332
if designed to nag the owner of the
rope.

2612
02:21:13,332 --> 02:21:19,748
A few hundred yards ahead of us Trampas
was now shouting loud cowboy shouts.

2613
02:21:19,748 --> 02:21:24,222
Were they to announce his return to those
at home, or did they mean derision?

2614
02:21:24,222 --> 02:21:27,643
The Virginian leaned,
keeping his seat, and,

2615
02:21:27,643 --> 02:21:31,397
swinging down his arm,
caught up the rope, and hung it on

2616
02:21:31,397 --> 02:21:33,339
his saddle somewhat carefully.

2617
02:21:33,339 --> 02:21:37,571
But the hue of rage spread over his face.

2618
02:21:37,571 --> 02:21:41,531
From his fence the divine now spoke,
in approbation, but with

2619
02:21:41,531 --> 02:21:43,892
another strong, cheerless smile.

2620
02:21:43,892 --> 02:21:47,223
“You pick up that rope as if you were
well trained to it.”

2621
02:21:47,223 --> 02:21:50,373
“It’s part of our business,
seh, and we try to mind

2622
02:21:50,373 --> 02:21:51,683
it like the rest.”

2623
02:21:51,683 --> 02:21:57,072
But this, stated in a gentle drawl,
did not pierce the missionary’s armor;

2624
02:21:57,072 --> 02:22:00,147
his superiority was very thick.

2625
02:22:00,147 --> 02:22:05,708
We now rode on, and I was impressed by
the reverend gentleman’s robust,

2626
02:22:05,708 --> 02:22:09,873
dictatorial back as he proceeded by a
shortcut through the meadow to the

2627
02:22:09,873 --> 02:22:10,613
ranch.

2628
02:22:10,613 --> 02:22:14,979
You could take him for nothing but a
vigorous, sincere, dominating man,

2629
02:22:14,979 --> 02:22:17,425
full of the highest purpose.

2630
02:22:17,425 --> 02:22:20,464
But whatever his creed,
I already doubted if he were the right

2631
02:22:20,464 --> 02:22:25,121
one to sow it and make it grow in
these new, wild fields.

2632
02:22:25,121 --> 02:22:28,496
He seemed more the sort of gardener to
keep old walks and vines pruned

2633
02:22:28,496 --> 02:22:30,256
in their antique rigidity.

2634
02:22:30,256 --> 02:22:34,854
I admired him for coming all this way
with his clean, short,

2635
02:22:34,854 --> 02:22:38,972
gray whiskers and his
black, well-brushed suit.

2636
02:22:38,972 --> 02:22:42,938
And he made me think of a powerful
locomotive stuck puffing on a grade.

2637
02:22:42,938 --> 02:22:48,727
Meanwhile, the Virginian rode beside me,
so silent in his volcanic wrath that I

2638
02:22:48,727 --> 02:22:49,929
did not perceive it.

2639
02:22:49,929 --> 02:22:54,221
The missionary coming on top of Trampas
had been more than he could stand.

2640
02:22:54,221 --> 02:22:58,510
But I did not know, and I
spoke with innocent cheeriness.

2641
02:22:58,510 --> 02:23:00,880
“Is the parson going to save us?”

2642
02:23:00,880 --> 02:23:03,904
I asked; and I fairly
jumped at his voice:⁠—

2643
02:23:03,904 --> 02:23:05,435
“Don’t talk so much!”

2644
02:23:05,435 --> 02:23:06,265
he burst out.

2645
02:23:06,265 --> 02:23:09,714
I had got the whole accumulation!

2646
02:23:09,714 --> 02:23:11,074
“Who’s been talking?”

2647
02:23:11,074 --> 02:23:13,677
I in equal anger screeched back.

2648
02:23:13,677 --> 02:23:15,325
“I’m not trying to save you.

2649
02:23:15,325 --> 02:23:16,611
I didn’t take your rope.”

2650
02:23:16,611 --> 02:23:20,274
And having poured this out,
I whipped up my pony.

2651
02:23:20,274 --> 02:23:23,777
But he spurred his own alongside of me;
and glancing at him,

2652
02:23:23,777 --> 02:23:26,970
I saw that he was now
convulsed with internal mirth.

2653
02:23:26,970 --> 02:23:32,119
I therefore drew down to a walk,
and he straightened into gravity.

2654
02:23:32,119 --> 02:23:36,718
“I’m right obliged to yu’,” he laid his
hand in its buckskin gauntlet upon my

2655
02:23:36,718 --> 02:23:40,118
horse’s mane as he spoke,
“for bringing me back out o’ my

2656
02:23:40,118 --> 02:23:41,184
nonsense.

2657
02:23:41,184 --> 02:23:44,417
I’ll be as serene as a bird
now⁠—whatever they do.

2658
02:23:44,417 --> 02:23:48,848
A man,” he stated reflectively,
“any full-sized man,

2659
02:23:48,848 --> 02:23:50,914
ought to own a big lot of temper.

2660
02:23:50,914 --> 02:23:55,674
And like all his valuable possessions,
he’d ought to keep it and not lose any.”

2661
02:23:55,674 --> 02:23:58,615
This was his full apology.

2662
02:23:58,615 --> 02:24:04,486
“As for salvation, I have got this far:
somebody,” he swept an arm at the sunset

2663
02:24:04,486 --> 02:24:07,800
and the mountains, “must have made
all that, I know.

2664
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:12,847
But I know one more thing I would tell
Him to His face: if I can’t do nothing

2665
02:24:12,847 --> 02:24:17,467
long enough and good enough to earn
eternal happiness, I can’t do nothing

2666
02:24:17,467 --> 02:24:20,746
long enough and bad enough to be damned.

2667
02:24:20,746 --> 02:24:25,517
I reckon He plays a square game with us
if He plays at all, and I ain’t

2668
02:24:25,517 --> -1:59:59,000
bothering my haid about other worlds.

2669
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2670
02:24:28,045 --> 02:24:31,576
As we reached the stables,
he had become the serene bird he

2671
02:24:31,576 --> 02:24:34,725
promised, and was sentimentally
continuing:⁠—

2672
02:24:34,725 --> 02:24:40,686
“ ‘De sun is made of mud from de bottom
of de river;De moon is made o’ fox-fire,

2673
02:24:40,686 --> 02:24:44,510
as you might disciver;
De stars like de ladies’ eyes,

2674
02:24:44,510 --> 02:24:48,460
All round de world dey flies,
To give a little light when

2675
02:24:48,460 --> -1:59:59,000
de moon don’t rise.’

2676
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2677
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:55,025
If words were meant to conceal our
thoughts, melody is perhaps a still

2678
02:24:55,025 --> 02:24:56,145
thicker veil for them.

2679
02:24:56,145 --> 02:25:01,401
Whatever temper he had lost,
he had certainly found again;

2680
02:25:01,401 --> 02:25:06,716
but this all the more fitted him to deal
with Trampas, when the

2681
02:25:06,716 --> 02:25:08,625
dealing should begin.

2682
02:25:08,625 --> 02:25:12,778
I had half a mind to speak to the Judge,
only it seemed beyond

2683
02:25:12,778 --> 02:25:14,730
a mere visitor’s business.

2684
02:25:14,730 --> 02:25:19,409
Our missionary was at this moment himself
speaking to Judge Henry at the door

2685
02:25:19,409 --> 02:25:20,670
of the home ranch.

2686
02:25:20,670 --> 02:25:23,590
“I reckon he’s explaining
he has been awaiting.”

2687
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:27,976
The Virginian was throwing his saddle off
as I loosened the cinches of mine.

2688
02:25:27,976 --> 02:25:31,683
“And the Judge don’t look like
he was hopelessly distressed.”

2689
02:25:31,683 --> 02:25:36,433
I now surveyed the distant parley,
and the Judge, from the wagonful of

2690
02:25:36,433 --> 02:25:40,954
guests whom he had evidently been
driving upon a day’s excursion,

2691
02:25:40,954 --> 02:25:44,661
waved me a welcome, which I waved back.

2692
02:25:44,661 --> 02:25:46,937
“He’s got Miss Molly Wood there!”

2693
02:25:46,937 --> 02:25:48,851
I exclaimed.

2694
02:25:48,851 --> 02:25:50,095
“Yes.”

2695
02:25:50,095 --> 02:25:53,083
The Virginian was brief about this fact.

2696
02:25:53,083 --> 02:25:54,659
“I’ll look afteh your saddle.

2697
02:25:54,659 --> 02:25:56,915
You go and get acquainted
with the company.”

2698
02:25:56,915 --> 02:26:01,926
This favor I accepted;
it was the means he chose for saying he

2699
02:26:01,926 --> 02:26:06,166
hoped, after our recent boiling over,
that all was now more

2700
02:26:06,166 --> 02:26:08,228
than right between us.

2701
02:26:08,228 --> 02:26:12,867
So for the while I left him to his
horses, and his corrals,

2702
02:26:12,867 --> 02:26:16,702
and his Trampas, and his foreman,
and his imminent problem.

2703
02:26:16,702 --> 02:26:18,082
CHAPTER XIX

2704
02:26:18,082 --> 02:26:18,629
Dr.

2705
02:26:18,629 --> 02:26:20,105
Macbride Begs Pardon

2706
02:26:20,105 --> 02:26:24,794
Judge and Mrs. Henry,
Molly Wood, and two strangers,

2707
02:26:24,794 --> 02:26:27,739
a lady and a gentleman,
were the party which had been driving in

2708
02:26:27,739 --> 02:26:29,713
the large three-seated wagon.

2709
02:26:29,713 --> 02:26:32,504
They had seemed a merry party.

2710
02:26:32,504 --> 02:26:36,703
But as I came within hearing of their
talk, it was a fragment of the

2711
02:26:36,703 --> 02:26:39,515
minister’s sonority which
reached me first:⁠—

2712
02:26:39,515 --> 02:26:44,653
“… more opportunity for them to have the
benefit of hearing frequent sermons,”

2713
02:26:44,653 --> 02:26:47,205
was the sentence I heard
him bring to completion.

2714
02:26:47,205 --> 02:26:49,085
“Yes, to be sure, sir.”

2715
02:26:49,085 --> 02:26:55,026
Judge Henry gave me (it almost seemed)
additional warmth of welcome for

2716
02:26:55,026 --> 02:27:00,808
arriving to break up
the present discourse.

2717
02:27:00,808 --> 02:27:10,986
“Let me introduce you to the
Rev. Dr. Alexander MacBride.

2718
02:27:10,986 --> 02:27:15,281
Doctor, another guest we have been hoping
for about this time,”

2719
02:27:15,281 --> 02:27:19,301
was my host’s cordial explanation
to him of me.

2720
02:27:19,301 --> 02:27:24,702
There remained the gentleman with his
wife from New York, and to these I

2721
02:27:24,702 --> 02:27:27,358
made my final bows.

2722
02:27:27,358 --> 02:27:30,682
But I had not broken up the discourse.

2723
02:27:30,682 --> 02:27:33,184
“We may be said to have met already.”

2724
02:27:33,184 --> 02:27:33,744
Dr.

2725
02:27:33,744 --> 02:27:38,304
MacBride had fixed upon me his full,
mastering eye; and it occurred to me

2726
02:27:38,304 --> 02:27:42,144
that if they had policemen in heaven,
he would be at least a

2727
02:27:42,144 --> 02:27:43,424
centurion in the force.

2728
02:27:43,424 --> 02:27:47,864
But he did not mean to be unpleasant;
it was only that in a mind full of

2729
02:27:47,864 --> 02:27:51,256
matters less worldly,
pleasure was left out.

2730
02:27:51,256 --> 02:27:55,383
“I observed your friend was a
skilful horseman,” he continued.

2731
02:27:55,383 --> 02:28:00,016
“I was saying to Judge Henry that I could
wish such skilful horsemen might ride to

2732
02:28:00,016 --> 02:28:01,536
a church upon the Sabbath.

2733
02:28:01,536 --> 02:28:06,077
A church, that is, of right doctrine,
where they would have opportunity

2734
02:28:06,077 --> 02:28:08,398
to hear frequent sermons.”

2735
02:28:08,398 --> 02:28:12,000
“Yes,” said Judge Henry, “yes.

2736
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:13,167
It would be a good thing.”

2737
02:28:13,167 --> 02:28:13,560
Mrs.

2738
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:17,805
Henry, with some murmur about the
kitchen, here went into the house.

2739
02:28:17,805 --> 02:28:22,571
“I was informed,” Dr. MacBride held the
rest of us, “before undertaking my

2740
02:28:22,571 --> 02:28:27,171
journey that I should find a desolate
and mainly godless country.

2741
02:28:27,171 --> 02:28:31,691
But nobody gave me to understand that
from Medicine Bow I was to drive three

2742
02:28:31,691 --> 02:28:34,420
hundred miles and pass no
church of any faith.”

2743
02:28:34,420 --> 02:28:37,651
The Judge explained that there had been a
few a long way to the right

2744
02:28:37,651 --> 02:28:38,482
and left of him.

2745
02:28:38,482 --> 02:28:41,737
“Still,” he conceded,
“you are quite right.

2746
02:28:41,737 --> 02:28:46,816
But don’t forget that this is the newest
part of a new world.”

2747
02:28:46,816 --> 02:28:51,271
“Judge,” said his wife,
coming to the door, “how can you keep

2748
02:28:51,271 --> 02:28:54,030
them standing in the
dust with your talking?”

2749
02:28:54,030 --> 02:28:56,865
This most efficiently did
break up the discourse.

2750
02:28:56,865 --> 02:29:01,338
As our little party, with the smiles and
the polite holdings back of new

2751
02:29:01,338 --> 02:29:06,023
acquaintanceship, moved into the house,
the Judge detained me behind all of them

2752
02:29:06,023 --> -1:59:59,000
long enough to whisper dolorously,
“He’s going to stay a whole week.

2753
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2754
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:14,635
I had hopes that he would not stay a
whole week when I presently learned of

2755
02:29:14,635 --> 02:29:18,869
the crowded arrangements which our
hosts, with many hospitable

2756
02:29:18,869 --> 02:29:21,714
apologies, disclosed to us.

2757
02:29:21,714 --> 02:29:25,056
They were delighted to have us,
but they hadn’t foreseen that we

2758
02:29:25,056 --> 02:29:26,947
should all be simultaneous.

2759
02:29:26,947 --> 02:29:30,718
The foreman’s house had been prepared for
two of us, and did we mind?

2760
02:29:30,718 --> 02:29:35,524
The two of us were Dr. MacBride and
myself; and I expected him to mind.

2761
02:29:35,524 --> 02:29:37,079
But I wronged him grossly.

2762
02:29:37,079 --> 02:29:40,159
It would be much better,
he assured Mrs. Henry,

2763
02:29:40,159 --> 02:29:45,187
than straw in a stable,
which he had tried several times,

2764
02:29:45,187 --> 02:29:46,853
and was quite ready for.

2765
02:29:46,853 --> 02:29:52,692
So I saw that though he kept his vigorous
body clean when he could,

2766
02:29:52,692 --> 02:29:56,222
he cared nothing for it in the
face of his mission.

2767
02:29:56,222 --> 02:29:59,607
How the foreman and his wife relished
being turned out during a week for a

2768
02:29:59,607 --> 02:30:03,847
missionary and myself was not my
concern, although while he and I made

2769
02:30:03,847 --> 02:30:07,355
ready for supper over there,
it struck me as hard on them.

2770
02:30:07,355 --> 02:30:10,883
The room with its two cots and furniture
was as nice as possible;

2771
02:30:10,883 --> 02:30:14,532
and we closed the door upon the
adjoining room, which,

2772
02:30:14,532 --> 02:30:17,723
however, seemed also untenanted.

2773
02:30:17,723 --> 02:30:18,203
Mrs.

2774
02:30:18,203 --> 02:30:23,325
Henry gave us a meal so good that I have
remembered it, and her husband the Judge

2775
02:30:23,325 --> 02:30:26,838
strove his best that we should
eat it in merriment.

2776
02:30:26,838 --> 02:30:30,598
He poured out his anecdotes like wine,
and we should have quickly warmed to

2777
02:30:30,598 --> 02:30:37,319
them; but Dr. MacBride sat among us,
giving occasional heavy ha-ha’s,

2778
02:30:37,319 --> 02:30:41,726
which produced, as Miss Molly Wood
whispered to me, a “dreadfully

2779
02:30:41,726 --> 02:30:43,914
cavernous effect.”

2780
02:30:43,914 --> 02:30:47,931
Was it his sermon, we wondered,
that he was thinking over?

2781
02:30:47,931 --> 02:30:52,531
I told her of the copious sheaf of them I
had seen him pull from his wallet

2782
02:30:52,531 --> 02:30:54,072
over at the foreman’s.

2783
02:30:54,072 --> 02:30:55,237
“Goodness!”

2784
02:30:55,237 --> 02:30:56,059
said she.

2785
02:30:56,059 --> 02:30:57,856
“Then are we to hear one every evening?”

2786
02:30:57,856 --> 02:31:01,670
This I doubted; he had probably been
picking one out suitable

2787
02:31:01,670 --> 02:31:02,641
for the occasion.

2788
02:31:02,641 --> 02:31:06,430
“Putting his best foot foremost,”
was her comment; “I suppose they have

2789
02:31:06,430 --> 02:31:08,890
best feet, like the rest of us.”

2790
02:31:08,890 --> 02:31:11,181
Then she grew delightfully sharp.

2791
02:31:11,181 --> 02:31:16,174
“Do you know, when I first heard him I
thought his voice was hearty.

2792
02:31:16,174 --> 02:31:20,518
But if you listen, you’ll
find it’s merely militant.

2793
02:31:20,518 --> 02:31:22,639
He never really meets you with it.

2794
02:31:22,639 --> -1:59:59,000
He’s off on his hill watching the
battlefield the whole time.

2795
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2796
02:31:25,442 --> 02:31:27,357
“He will find a hardened pagan here.”

2797
02:31:27,357 --> 02:31:28,171
“Judge Henry?”

2798
02:31:28,171 --> 02:31:29,800
“Oh, no!

2799
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:33,699
The wild man you’re taming brought
you Kenilworth safe back.”

2800
02:31:33,699 --> 02:31:34,779
She was smooth.

2801
02:31:34,779 --> 02:31:37,019
“Oh, as for taming him!

2802
02:31:37,019 --> 02:31:39,500
But don’t you find him intelligent?”

2803
02:31:39,500 --> 02:31:43,124
Suddenly I somehow knew that she didn’t
want to tame him.

2804
02:31:43,124 --> 02:31:45,380
But what did she want to do?

2805
02:31:45,380 --> 02:31:48,090
The thought of her had made
him blush this afternoon.

2806
02:31:48,090 --> 02:31:51,950
No thought of him made
her blush this evening.

2807
02:31:51,950 --> 02:31:56,953
A great laugh from the rest of the
company made me aware that the Judge had

2808
02:31:56,953 --> 02:32:00,063
consummated his tale
of the “Sole Survivor.”

2809
02:32:00,063 --> 02:32:04,903
“And so,” he finished,
“they all went off as mad as hops

2810
02:32:04,903 --> 02:32:07,112
because it hadn’t been a massacre.”

2811
02:32:07,112 --> 02:32:13,627
Mr. and Mrs. Ogden⁠—they were the New
Yorkers⁠—gave this story much applause,

2812
02:32:13,627 --> 02:32:20,362
and Dr. MacBride half a minute later
laid his “ha-ha,” like a heavy

2813
02:32:20,362 --> 02:32:22,572
stone, upon the gaiety.

2814
02:32:22,572 --> 02:32:27,244
“I’ll never be able to stand seven
sermons,” said Miss Wood to me.

2815
02:32:27,244 --> 02:32:30,645
“Talking of massacres,”
⁠—I now hastened to address the already

2816
02:32:30,645 --> 02:32:34,128
saddened table⁠—“I have
recently escaped one myself.”

2817
02:32:34,128 --> 02:32:36,483
The Judge had come to an
end of his powers.

2818
02:32:36,483 --> 02:32:37,877
“Oh, tell us!”

2819
02:32:37,877 --> 02:32:38,847
he implored.

2820
02:32:38,847 --> 02:32:44,629
“Seriously, sir, I think we grazed pretty
wet tragedy but your extraordinary man

2821
02:32:44,629 --> 02:32:46,886
brought us out into comedy safe and
dry.”

2822
02:32:46,886 --> 02:32:50,932
This gave me their attention;
and, from that afternoon in Dakota when

2823
02:32:50,932 --> 02:32:55,494
I had first stepped aboard the caboose,
I told them the whole tale of my

2824
02:32:55,494 --> 02:33:00,038
experience: how I grew immediately aware
that all was not right,

2825
02:33:00,038 --> 02:33:05,450
by the Virginian’s kicking the cook off
the train; how, as we journeyed,

2826
02:33:05,450 --> 02:33:08,390
the dark bubble of mutiny swelled hourly
beneath my eyes; and how,

2827
02:33:08,390 --> 02:33:12,310
when it was threatening I know not what
explosion, the Virginian had pricked it

2828
02:33:12,310 --> 02:33:16,069
with humor, so that it burst in
nothing but harmless laughter.

2829
02:33:16,069 --> 02:33:20,711
Their eyes followed my narrative:
the New Yorkers, because such events do

2830
02:33:20,711 --> 02:33:25,351
not happen upon the shores of the
Hudson; Mrs. Henry, because she was my

2831
02:33:25,351 --> 02:33:29,545
hostess; Miss Wood followed for whatever
her reasons were⁠—I

2832
02:33:29,545 --> 02:33:36,044
couldn’t see her eyes;
rather, I felther listening intently to

2833
02:33:36,044 --> 02:33:40,987
the deeds and dangers of the man she
didn’t care to tame.

2834
02:33:40,987 --> 02:33:46,747
But it was the eyes of the Judge and the
missionary which I saw riveted upon me

2835
02:33:46,747 --> 02:33:51,031
indeed until the end;
and they forthwith made plain

2836
02:33:51,031 --> 02:33:53,071
their quite dissimilar opinions.

2837
02:33:53,071 --> 02:33:56,808
Judge Henry struck the table
lightly with his fist.

2838
02:33:56,808 --> 02:33:57,738
“I knew it!”

2839
02:33:57,738 --> 02:34:01,331
And he leaned back in his chair with
a face of contentment.

2840
02:34:01,331 --> 02:34:06,447
He had trusted his man,
and his man had proved worthy.

2841
02:34:06,447 --> 02:34:07,352
“Pardon me.”

2842
02:34:07,352 --> 02:34:07,992
Dr.

2843
02:34:07,992 --> 02:34:13,627
MacBride had a manner of saying “pardon
me,” which rendered forgiveness

2844
02:34:13,627 --> 02:34:15,930
well-nigh impossible.

2845
02:34:15,930 --> 02:34:19,827
The Judge waited for him.

2846
02:34:19,827 --> 02:34:24,440
“Am I to understand that these⁠—a⁠—
cowboys attempted to mutiny,

2847
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:28,528
and were discouraged in this attempt
upon finding themselves less skilful at

2848
02:34:28,528 --> 02:34:31,796
lying than the man they
had plotted to depose?”

2849
02:34:31,796 --> 02:34:32,923
I began an answer.

2850
02:34:32,923 --> 02:34:37,086
“It was other qualities,
sir, that happened to be revealed and

2851
02:34:37,086 --> 02:34:40,046
asserted by what you
call his lying that⁠—”

2852
02:34:40,046 --> 02:34:43,381
“And what am I to call it,
if it is not lying?

2853
02:34:43,381 --> 02:34:48,219
A competition in deceit in which,
I admit, he out did them.

2854
02:34:48,219 --> 02:34:49,696
“It’s their way to⁠—”

2855
02:34:49,696 --> 02:34:50,655
“Pardon me.

2856
02:34:50,655 --> 02:34:51,892
Their way to lie?

2857
02:34:51,892 --> 02:34:54,633
They bow down to the greatest in this?”

2858
02:34:54,633 --> 02:34:57,352
“Oh,” said Miss Wood in my
ear, “give him up.”

2859
02:34:57,352 --> 02:34:58,595
The Judge took a turn.

2860
02:34:58,595 --> 02:35:01,365
“We-ell, Doctor⁠—” He
seemed to stick here.

2861
02:35:01,365 --> 02:35:01,799
Mr.

2862
02:35:01,799 --> 02:35:04,843
Ogden handsomely assisted him.

2863
02:35:04,843 --> 02:35:07,803
“You’ve said the word yourself, Doctor.

2864
02:35:07,803 --> 02:35:10,571
It’s the competition, don’t you see?

2865
02:35:10,571 --> 02:35:13,403
The trial of strength by
no matter what test.”

2866
02:35:13,403 --> 02:35:17,076
“Yes,” said Miss Wood, unexpectedly.

2867
02:35:17,076 --> 02:35:21,874
“And it wasn’t that George Washington
couldn’t tell a lie.

2868
02:35:21,874 --> 02:35:23,171
He just wouldn’t.

2869
02:35:23,171 --> 02:35:27,702
I’m sure if he’d undertaken to he’d have
told a much better one than Cornwall’s.”

2870
02:35:27,702 --> 02:35:28,822
“Ha-ha, madam!

2871
02:35:28,822 --> 02:35:31,853
You draw an ingenious
subtlety from your books.”

2872
02:35:31,853 --> 02:35:34,903
“It’s all plain to me,” Ogden pursued.

2873
02:35:34,903 --> 02:35:36,426
“The men were morose.

2874
02:35:36,426 --> 02:35:38,750
This foreman was in the minority.

2875
02:35:38,750 --> 02:35:43,374
He cajoled them into a bout of tall
stories, and told the tallest himself.

2876
02:35:43,374 --> 02:35:47,413
And when they found they had swallowed it
whole⁠—well, it would certainly take the

2877
02:35:47,413 --> 02:35:49,925
starch out of me,” he concluded.

2878
02:35:49,925 --> 02:35:52,208
“I couldn’t be a serious
mutineer after that.”

2879
02:35:52,208 --> 02:35:52,725
Dr.

2880
02:35:52,725 --> 02:35:54,955
MacBride now sounded his strongest bass.

2881
02:35:54,955 --> 02:35:56,065
“Pardon me.

2882
02:35:56,065 --> 02:35:58,614
I cannot accept such a view, sir.

2883
02:35:58,614 --> 02:36:02,955
There is a levity abroad in our land
which I must deplore.

2884
02:36:02,955 --> 02:36:07,539
No matter how leniently you may try to
put it, in the end we have the spectacle

2885
02:36:07,539 --> 02:36:13,594
of a struggle between men where lying
decides the survival of the fittest.

2886
02:36:13,594 --> 02:36:18,072
Better, far better, if it was to come,
that they had shot honest bullets.

2887
02:36:18,072 --> 02:36:20,290
There are worse evils than war.”

2888
02:36:20,290 --> 02:36:22,776
The Doctor’s eye glared
righteously about him.

2889
02:36:22,776 --> 02:36:26,522
None of us, I think, trembled;
or, if we did, it was with

2890
02:36:26,522 --> 02:36:29,454
emotions other than fear.

2891
02:36:29,454 --> 02:36:29,736
Mrs.

2892
02:36:29,736 --> 02:36:35,379
Henry at once introduced the subject of
trout-fishing, and thus happily removed

2893
02:36:35,379 --> 02:36:39,321
us from the edge of whatever sort of
precipice we seemed to have approached;

2894
02:36:39,321 --> 02:36:41,949
for Dr. MacBride had brought his rod.

2895
02:36:41,949 --> 02:36:46,919
He dilated upon this sport with fervor,
and we assured him that the streams upon

2896
02:36:46,919 --> 02:36:51,807
the west slope of the Bow Leg Mountains
would afford him plenty of it.

2897
02:36:51,807 --> 02:36:56,618
Thus we ended our meal
in carefully preserved amity.

2898
02:36:56,618 --> 02:36:57,943
CHAPTER XX

2899
02:36:57,943 --> 02:37:00,533
The Judge Ignores Particulars

2900
02:37:00,533 --> 02:37:03,633
“Do you often have these visitations?”

2901
02:37:03,633 --> 02:37:05,901
Ogden inquired of Judge Henry.

2902
02:37:05,901 --> 02:37:09,792
Our host was giving us whiskey in his
office, and Dr. MacBride,

2903
02:37:09,792 --> 02:37:14,450
while we smoked apart from the ladies,
had repaired to his quarters in the

2904
02:37:14,450 --> 02:37:18,809
foreman’s house previous to the service
which he was shortly to hold.

2905
02:37:18,809 --> 02:37:20,067
The Judge laughed.

2906
02:37:20,067 --> 02:37:22,996
“They come now and then through the year.

2907
02:37:22,996 --> 02:37:24,649
I like the bishop to come.

2908
02:37:24,649 --> 02:37:26,826
And the men always like it.

2909
02:37:26,826 --> 02:37:30,002
But I fear our friend will scarcely
please them so well.”

2910
02:37:30,002 --> 02:37:31,316
“You don’t mean they’ll⁠—”

2911
02:37:31,316 --> 02:37:32,039
“Oh, no.

2912
02:37:32,039 --> 02:37:33,440
They’ll keep quiet.

2913
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:39,289
The fact is, they have a good deal better
manners than he has, if he only knew it.

2914
02:37:39,289 --> 02:37:41,042
They’ll be able to bear him.

2915
02:37:41,042 --> 02:37:42,609
But as for any good he’ll do⁠—”

2916
02:37:42,609 --> 02:37:47,290
“I doubt if he knows a word of science,”
said I, musing about the Doctor.

2917
02:37:47,290 --> 02:37:48,639
“Science!

2918
02:37:48,639 --> 02:37:52,043
He doesn’t know what Christianity is yet.

2919
02:37:52,043 --> 02:37:55,486
I’ve entertained many guests,
but none⁠—The whole secret,”

2920
02:37:55,486 --> 02:37:59,407
broke off Judge Henry,
“lies in the way you treat people.

2921
02:37:59,407 --> 02:38:03,133
As soon as you treat men as your
brothers, they are ready to acknowledge

2922
02:38:03,133 --> 02:38:06,574
you⁠—if you deserve it⁠—
as their superior.

2923
02:38:06,574 --> 02:38:10,537
That’s the whole bottom of Christianity,
and that’s what our missionary

2924
02:38:10,537 --> -1:59:59,000
will never know.

2925
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2926
02:38:11,513 --> 02:38:16,010
There was a somewhat heavy knock at the
office door, and I think we all feared

2927
02:38:16,010 --> 02:38:17,561
it was Dr. MacBride.

2928
02:38:17,561 --> 02:38:21,074
But when the Judge opened,
the Virginian was standing

2929
02:38:21,074 --> 02:38:22,414
there in the darkness.

2930
02:38:22,414 --> 02:38:23,153
“So!”

2931
02:38:23,153 --> 02:38:25,166
The Judge opened the door wide.

2932
02:38:25,166 --> 02:38:30,037
He was very hearty to the
man he had trusted.

2933
02:38:30,037 --> 02:38:32,877
“You’re back at last.”

2934
02:38:32,877 --> 02:38:34,981
“I came to repawt.”

2935
02:38:34,981 --> 02:38:38,026
While they shook hands, Ogden nudged me.

2936
02:38:38,026 --> 02:38:38,982
“That the fellow?”

2937
02:38:38,982 --> 02:38:39,910
I nodded.

2938
02:38:39,910 --> 02:38:42,631
“Fellow who kicked the
cook off the train?”

2939
02:38:42,631 --> 02:38:47,436
I again nodded, and he looked at the
Virginian, his eye and his stature.

2940
02:38:47,436 --> 02:38:52,244
Judge Henry, properly democratic,
now introduced him to Ogden.

2941
02:38:52,244 --> 02:38:57,480
The New Yorker also meant
to be properly democratic.

2942
02:38:57,480 --> -1:59:59,000
“You’re the man I’ve been hearing
such a lot about.

2943
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2944
02:39:00,675 --> 02:39:04,332
But familiarity is not equality.

2945
02:39:04,332 --> 02:39:09,645
“Then I expect yu’ have the advantage of
me, seh,” said the Virginian,

2946
02:39:09,645 --> 02:39:11,427
very politely.

2947
02:39:11,427 --> 02:39:13,038
“Shall I repawt tomorro’?”

2948
02:39:13,038 --> 02:39:15,496
His grave eyes were on the Judge again.

2949
02:39:15,496 --> 02:39:21,133
Of me he had taken no notice;
he had come as an employee

2950
02:39:21,133 --> 02:39:22,780
to see his employer.

2951
02:39:22,780 --> 02:39:26,012
“Yes, yes; I’ll want to hear
about the cattle tomorrow.

2952
02:39:26,012 --> 02:39:28,415
But step inside a moment now.

2953
02:39:28,415 --> 02:39:33,305
There’s a matter⁠—” The Virginian stepped
inside, and took off his hat.

2954
02:39:33,305 --> 02:39:35,236
“Sit down.

2955
02:39:35,236 --> 02:39:39,156
You had trouble⁠—I’ve heard something
about it,” the Judge went on.

2956
02:39:39,156 --> 02:39:43,041
The Virginian sat down,
grave and graceful.

2957
02:39:43,041 --> 02:39:45,439
But he held the brim of his
hat all the while.

2958
02:39:45,439 --> 02:39:49,261
He looked at Ogden and me,
and then back at his employer.

2959
02:39:49,261 --> 02:39:51,308
There was reluctance in his eye.

2960
02:39:51,308 --> 02:39:54,937
I wondered if his employer could be going
to make him tell his own exploits in the

2961
02:39:54,937 --> 02:39:58,669
presence of us outsiders;
and there came into my memory the Bengal

2962
02:39:58,669 --> 02:40:01,295
tiger at a trained-animal show
I had once seen.

2963
02:40:01,295 --> 02:40:03,911
“You had some trouble,”
repeated the Judge.

2964
02:40:03,911 --> 02:40:08,834
“Well, there was a time when they maybe
wanted to have notions.

2965
02:40:08,834 --> 02:40:10,077
They’re good boys.”

2966
02:40:10,077 --> 02:40:12,884
And he smiled a very little.

2967
02:40:12,884 --> 02:40:16,492
Contentment increased in the Judge’s face.

2968
02:40:16,492 --> -1:59:59,000
“Trampas a good boy too?

2969
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2970
02:40:18,173 --> 02:40:22,483
But this time the Bengal
tiger did not smile.

2971
02:40:22,483 --> 02:40:25,462
He sat with his eye fastened
on his employer.

2972
02:40:25,462 --> 02:40:28,736
The Judge passed rather quickly on
to his next point.

2973
02:40:28,736 --> 02:40:31,843
“You’ve brought them all back,
though, I understand,

2974
02:40:31,843 --> 02:40:34,862
safe and sound, without a scratch?”

2975
02:40:34,862 --> 02:40:40,057
The Virginian looked down at his hat,
then up again at the Judge, mildly.

2976
02:40:40,057 --> 02:40:41,653
“I had to part with my cook.”

2977
02:40:41,653 --> 02:40:45,930
There was no use; Ogden
and myself exploded.

2978
02:40:45,930 --> 02:40:50,862
Even upon the embarrassed Virginian a
large grin slowly forced itself.

2979
02:40:50,862 --> 02:40:53,380
“I guess yu’ know about it,” he murmured.

2980
02:40:53,380 --> 02:40:56,970
And he looked at me with
a sort of reproach.

2981
02:40:56,970 --> 02:41:01,281
He knew it was I who had told
tales out of school.

2982
02:41:01,281 --> 02:41:05,332
“I only want to say,”
said Ogden, conciliatingly,

2983
02:41:05,332 --> 02:41:07,891
“that I know I couldn’t
have handled those men.”

2984
02:41:07,891 --> 02:41:09,133
The Virginian relented.

2985
02:41:09,133 --> 02:41:11,574
“Yu’ never tried, seh.”

2986
02:41:11,574 --> 02:41:16,104
The Judge had remained serious;
but he showed himself plainly

2987
02:41:16,104 --> 02:41:17,782
more and more contented.

2988
02:41:17,782 --> 02:41:19,719
“Quite right,” he said.

2989
02:41:19,719 --> 02:41:22,185
“You had to part with your cook.

2990
02:41:22,185 --> 02:41:25,597
When I put a man in charge,
I put him in charge.

2991
02:41:25,597 --> 02:41:28,439
I don’t make particulars my business.

2992
02:41:28,439 --> 02:41:31,994
They’re to be always his.

2993
02:41:31,994 --> -1:59:59,000
Do you understand?

2994
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2995
02:41:34,770 --> 02:41:35,553
“Thank yu’.”

2996
02:41:35,553 --> 02:41:39,393
The Virginian understood that his
employer was praising his

2997
02:41:39,393 --> 02:41:41,192
management of the expedition.

2998
02:41:41,192 --> 02:41:46,395
But I don’t think he at all discerned⁠—as
I did presently⁠—that his employer had

2999
02:41:46,395 --> 02:41:50,626
just been putting him to a further test,
had laid before him the temptation of

3000
02:41:50,626 --> 02:41:54,804
complaining of a fellow-workman and
blowing his own trumpet,

3001
02:41:54,804 --> 02:41:58,280
and was delighted with his reticence.

3002
02:41:58,280 --> 02:42:00,505
He made a movement to rise.

3003
02:42:00,505 --> 02:42:04,073
“I haven’t finished,” said the Judge.

3004
02:42:04,073 --> 02:42:07,727
“I was coming to the matter.

3005
02:42:07,727 --> 02:42:12,808
There’s one particular⁠—since I do happen
to have been told.

3006
02:42:12,808 --> 02:42:16,340
I fancy Trampas has learned
something he didn’t expect.”

3007
02:42:16,340 --> 02:42:22,408
This time the Virginian evidently did not
understand, any more than I did.

3008
02:42:22,408 --> 02:42:26,974
One hand played with his hat,
mechanically turning it round.

3009
02:42:26,974 --> 02:42:28,977
The Judge explained.

3010
02:42:28,977 --> 02:42:31,366
“I mean about Roberts.”

3011
02:42:31,366 --> 02:42:36,098
A pulse of triumph shot over the
Southerner’s face, turning it savage

3012
02:42:36,098 --> 02:42:37,613
for that fleeting instant.

3013
02:42:37,613 --> 02:42:41,277
He understood now, and was unable to
suppress this much answer.

3014
02:42:41,277 --> 02:42:42,657
But he was silent.

3015
02:42:42,657 --> 02:42:46,536
“You see,” the Judge explained to me,
“I was obliged to let Roberts,

3016
02:42:46,536 --> 02:42:49,112
my old foreman, go last week.

3017
02:42:49,112 --> 02:42:52,504
His wife could not have stood another
winter here, and a good position was

3018
02:42:52,504 --> 02:42:54,500
offered to him near Los Angeles.”

3019
02:42:54,500 --> 02:42:55,355
I did see.

3020
02:42:55,355 --> 02:42:57,435
I saw a number of things.

3021
02:42:57,435 --> 02:43:02,246
I saw why the foreman’s house had been
empty to receive Dr. MacBride and me.

3022
02:43:02,246 --> 02:43:06,351
And I saw that the Judge had
been very clever indeed.

3023
02:43:06,351 --> 02:43:10,200
For I had abstained from telling any
tales about the present feeling between

3024
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:12,401
Trampas and the Virginian;
but he had divined it.

3025
02:43:12,401 --> 02:43:14,959
Well enough for him to say that
“particulars” were something he let

3026
02:43:14,959 --> 02:43:15,659
alone

3027
02:43:15,659 --> 02:43:18,799
; he evidently kept a deep eye on the
undercurrents at his ranch.

3028
02:43:18,799 --> 02:43:22,841
He knew that in Roberts,
Trampas had lost a powerful friend.

3029
02:43:22,841 --> 02:43:28,413
And this was what I most saw,
this final fact, that Trampas had no

3030
02:43:28,413 --> 02:43:30,255
longer any intervening shield.

3031
02:43:30,255 --> 02:43:33,953
He and the Virginian stood
indeed man to man.

3032
02:43:33,953 --> 02:43:39,434
“And so,” the Judge continued speaking to
me, “here I am at a very inconvenient

3033
02:43:39,434 --> 02:43:40,834
time without a foreman.

3034
02:43:40,834 --> 02:43:44,882
Unless,” I caught the twinkle in his eyes
before he turned to the Virginian,

3035
02:43:44,882 --> 02:43:47,637
“unless you’re willing to
take the position yourself.

3036
02:43:47,637 --> 02:43:48,411
Will you?”

3037
02:43:48,411 --> 02:43:53,358
I saw the Southerner’s hand grip his hat
as he was turning it round.

3038
02:43:53,358 --> 02:43:56,566
He held it still now,
and his other hand found it and

3039
02:43:56,566 --> 02:43:59,086
gradually crumpled the soft crown in.

3040
02:43:59,086 --> 02:44:02,401
It meant everything to him:
recognition, higher station,

3041
02:44:02,401 --> 02:44:08,462
better fortune, a separate house of his
own, and⁠—perhaps⁠—one step nearer to

3042
02:44:08,462 --> 02:44:09,567
the woman he wanted.

3043
02:44:09,567 --> 02:44:15,287
I don’t know what words he might have
said to the Judge had they been alone,

3044
02:44:15,287 --> 02:44:19,566
but the Judge had chosen to do it in our
presence, the whole thing

3045
02:44:19,566 --> 02:44:22,402
from beginning to end.

3046
02:44:22,402 --> 02:44:26,231
The Virginian sat with the damp coming
out on his forehead,

3047
02:44:26,231 --> 02:44:29,193
and his eyes dropped from his
employer’s.

3048
02:44:29,193 --> 02:44:32,901
“Thank yu’,” was what he managed
at last to say.

3049
02:44:32,901 --> 02:44:36,488
“Well, now, I’m greatly relieved!”

3050
02:44:36,488 --> 02:44:39,567
exclaimed the Judge, rising at once.

3051
02:44:39,567 --> 02:44:42,273
He spoke with haste, and lightly.

3052
02:44:42,273 --> 02:44:44,123
“That’s excellent.

3053
02:44:44,123 --> 02:44:47,778
I was in some thing of a hole,”
he said to Ogden and me;

3054
02:44:47,778 --> 02:44:50,116
“and this gives me one thing
less to think of.

3055
02:44:50,116 --> 02:44:54,908
Saves me a lot of particulars,”
he jocosely added to the Virginian,

3056
02:44:54,908 --> 02:44:56,664
who was now also standing up.

3057
02:44:56,664 --> 02:44:58,116
“Begin right off.

3058
02:44:58,116 --> 02:44:59,995
Leave the bunk house.

3059
02:44:59,995 --> 02:45:03,190
The gentlemen won’t mind your sleeping
in your own house.”

3060
02:45:03,190 --> 02:45:05,510
Thus he dismissed his new foreman gayly.

3061
02:45:05,510 --> 02:45:10,825
But the new foreman, when he got outside,
turned back for one gruff word⁠—“I’ll

3062
02:45:10,825 --> 02:45:12,825
try to please yu’.”

3063
02:45:12,825 --> 02:45:14,144
That was all.

3064
02:45:14,144 --> 02:45:16,432
He was gone in the darkness.

3065
02:45:16,432 --> 02:45:20,508
But there was light enough for me,
looking after him, to see him lay his

3066
02:45:20,508 --> 02:45:24,926
hand on a shoulder-high gate and vault
it as if he had been the wind.

3067
02:45:24,926 --> 02:45:29,353
Sounds of cheering came to us a few
moments later from the bunk house.

3068
02:45:29,353 --> 02:45:33,350
Evidently he had “begun right away,”
as the Judge had directed.

3069
02:45:33,350 --> 02:45:39,977
He had told his fortune to his brother
cowpunchers, and this was their answer.

3070
02:45:39,977 --> 02:45:42,143
“I wonder if Trampas is shouting too?”

3071
02:45:42,143 --> 02:45:43,257
inquired Ogden.

3072
02:45:43,257 --> 02:45:44,047
“Hm!”

3073
02:45:44,047 --> 02:45:45,138
said the Judge.

3074
02:45:45,138 --> -1:59:59,000
“That is one of the particulars I
wash my hands of.

3075
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3076
02:45:48,362 --> 02:45:51,018
I knew that he entirely meant it.

3077
02:45:51,018 --> 02:45:56,100
I knew, once his decision taken of
appointing the Virginian his lieutenant

3078
02:45:56,100 --> 02:45:59,317
for good and all, that,
like a wise commander-in-chief,

3079
02:45:59,317 --> 02:46:03,245
he would trust his lieutenant to take
care of his own business.

3080
02:46:03,245 --> 02:46:08,644
“Well,” Ogden pursued with interest,
“haven’t you landed Trampas

3081
02:46:08,644 --> 02:46:10,091
plump at his mercy?”

3082
02:46:10,091 --> 02:46:12,537
The phrase tickled the Judge.

3083
02:46:12,537 --> 02:46:14,180
“That is where I’ve landed him!”

3084
02:46:14,180 --> 02:46:14,988
he declared.

3085
02:46:14,988 --> 02:46:17,074
“And here is Dr. MacBride.”

3086
02:46:17,074 --> 02:46:18,540
CHAPTER XXI

3087
02:46:18,540 --> 02:46:19,460
In a State of Sin

3088
02:46:19,460 --> 02:46:23,594
Thunder sat imminent upon
the missionary’s brow.

3089
02:46:23,594 --> 02:46:25,983
Many were to be at his mercy soon.

3090
02:46:25,983 --> 02:46:28,234
But for us he had sunshine still.

3091
02:46:28,234 --> 02:46:32,895
“I am truly sorry to be turning you
upside down,” he said importantly.

3092
02:46:32,895 --> 02:46:35,153
“But it seems the best
place for my service.”

3093
02:46:35,153 --> 02:46:38,496
He spoke of the tables pushed back and
the chairs gathered in the hall,

3094
02:46:38,496 --> 02:46:41,135
where the storm would presently
break upon the congregation.

3095
02:46:41,135 --> 02:46:41,895
“Eight-thirty?”

3096
02:46:41,895 --> 02:46:43,356
he inquired.

3097
02:46:43,356 --> 02:46:47,552
This was the hour appointed,
and it was only twenty minutes off.

3098
02:46:47,552 --> 02:46:52,135
We threw the unsmoked fractions of our
cigars away, and returned to offer our

3099
02:46:52,135 --> 02:46:54,135
services to the ladies.

3100
02:46:54,135 --> 02:46:56,035
This amused the ladies.

3101
02:46:56,035 --> 02:46:57,374
They had done without us.

3102
02:46:57,374 --> 02:47:00,451
All was ready in the hall.

3103
02:47:00,451 --> 02:47:04,319
“We got the cook to help us,”
Mrs. Ogden told me, “so as not

3104
02:47:04,319 --> 02:47:06,301
to disturb your cigars.

3105
02:47:06,301 --> 02:47:10,467
In spite of the cowboys,
I still recognize my own country.”

3106
02:47:10,467 --> 02:47:11,354
“In the cook?”

3107
02:47:11,354 --> 02:47:13,344
I rather densely asked.

3108
02:47:13,344 --> 02:47:15,624
“Oh, no!

3109
02:47:15,624 --> 02:47:17,566
I don’t have a Chinaman.

3110
02:47:17,566 --> -1:59:59,000
It’s in the length of after-dinner cigars.

3111
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3112
02:47:21,549 --> 02:47:24,370
“Had you been smoking,”
I returned, “you would have found

3113
02:47:24,370 --> 02:47:25,610
them short this evening.”

3114
02:47:25,610 --> 02:47:30,016
“You make it worse,” said the lady;
“we have had nothing but Dr. MacBride.”

3115
02:47:30,016 --> 02:47:33,582
“We’ll share him with
you now,” I exclaimed.

3116
02:47:33,582 --> 02:47:36,251
“Has he announced his text?

3117
02:47:36,251 --> 02:47:40,163
I’ve got one for him,”
said Molly Wood, joining us.

3118
02:47:40,163 --> 02:47:43,464
She stood on tiptoe and spoke it
comically in our ears.

3119
02:47:43,464 --> -1:59:59,000
“ ‘I said in my haste, All men are liars.’

3120
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3121
02:47:46,426 --> 02:47:50,946
This made us merry as we stood among the
chairs in the congested hall.

3122
02:47:50,946 --> 02:47:54,048
I left the ladies, and
sought the bunk house.

3123
02:47:54,048 --> 02:47:57,689
I had heard the cheers,
but I was curious also to see the men,

3124
02:47:57,689 --> 02:47:59,169
and how they were taking it.

3125
02:47:59,169 --> 02:48:02,215
There was but little for the eye.

3126
02:48:02,215 --> 02:48:04,262
There was much noise in the room.

3127
02:48:04,262 --> 02:48:07,609
They were getting ready to come to
church⁠—brushing their hair,

3128
02:48:07,609 --> 02:48:11,772
shaving, and making themselves clean,
amid talk occasionally

3129
02:48:11,772 --> 02:48:14,613
profane and continuously diverting.

3130
02:48:14,613 --> 02:48:18,155
“Well, I’m a Christian,
anyway,” one declared.

3131
02:48:18,155 --> 02:48:20,656
“I’m a Mormon, I guess,” said another.

3132
02:48:20,656 --> 02:48:25,168
“I belong to the Knights of
Pythias,” said a third.

3133
02:48:25,168 --> 02:48:28,612
“I’m a Mohammedist,” said a fourth;
“I hope I ain’t goin’ to hear

3134
02:48:28,612 --> -1:59:59,000
nothin’ to shock me.

3135
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3136
02:48:29,640 --> 02:48:31,233
And they went on with their joking.

3137
02:48:31,233 --> 02:48:33,912
But Trampas was out of the joking.

3138
02:48:33,912 --> 02:48:37,932
He lay on his bed reading a newspaper,
and took no pains to look pleasant.

3139
02:48:37,932 --> 02:48:42,060
My eyes were considering him when the
blithe Scipio came in.

3140
02:48:42,060 --> 02:48:44,318
“Don’t look so bashful,” said he.

3141
02:48:44,318 --> 02:48:45,816
“There’s only us girls here.”

3142
02:48:45,816 --> 02:48:49,373
He had been helping the Virginian move
his belongings from the bunk house over

3143
02:48:49,373 --> 02:48:50,631
to the foreman’s cabin.

3144
02:48:50,631 --> 02:48:55,075
He himself was to occupy the
Virginian’s old bed here.

3145
02:48:55,075 --> 02:48:59,245
“And I hope sleepin’ in it will bring me
some of his luck,” said Scipio.

3146
02:48:59,245 --> 02:49:03,828
“Yu’d ought to’ve seen us when he told us
in his quiet way.

3147
02:49:03,828 --> 02:49:07,977
Well,” Scipio sighed a little,
“it must feel good to have your

3148
02:49:07,977 --> 02:49:09,478
friends glad about you.”

3149
02:49:09,478 --> 02:49:13,065
“Especially Trampas,” said I.

3150
02:49:13,065 --> 02:49:15,798
“The Judge knows about that,” I added.

3151
02:49:15,798 --> 02:49:17,538
“Knows, does he?

3152
02:49:17,538 --> 02:49:18,557
What’s he say?”

3153
02:49:18,557 --> 02:49:21,277
Scipio drew me quickly out
of the bunk house.

3154
02:49:21,277 --> 02:49:23,239
“Says it’s no business of his.”

3155
02:49:23,239 --> 02:49:24,480
“Said nothing but that?”

3156
02:49:24,480 --> 02:49:29,122
Scipio’s curiosity seemed
strangely intense.

3157
02:49:29,122 --> 02:49:31,381
“Made no suggestion?

3158
02:49:31,381 --> 02:49:32,522
Not a thing?”

3159
02:49:32,522 --> 02:49:33,477
“Not a thing.

3160
02:49:33,477 --> 02:49:36,423
Said he didn’t want to
know and didn’t care.”

3161
02:49:36,423 --> 02:49:39,026
“How did he happen to hear about it?”

3162
02:49:39,026 --> 02:49:40,066
snapped Scipio.

3163
02:49:40,066 --> 02:49:41,160
“You told him!”

3164
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:42,746
he immediately guessed.

3165
02:49:42,746 --> 02:49:43,946
“He never would.”

3166
02:49:43,946 --> 02:49:47,786
And Scipio jerked his thumb at the
Virginian, who appeared for a moment in

3167
02:49:47,786 --> 02:49:50,679
the lighted window of the new
quarters he was arranging.

3168
02:49:50,679 --> 02:49:53,561
“He never would tell,” Scipio repeated.

3169
02:49:53,561 --> 02:49:58,166
“And so the Judge never made a suggestion
to him,” he muttered,

3170
02:49:58,166 --> 02:50:00,210
nodding in the darkness.

3171
02:50:00,210 --> 02:50:03,300
“So it’s just his own notion.

3172
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:07,093
Just like him, too, come to think of it.

3173
02:50:07,093 --> 02:50:10,715
Only I didn’t expect⁠—well,
I guess he could surprise me

3174
02:50:10,715 --> -1:59:59,000
any day he tried.

3175
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3176
02:50:12,247 --> 02:50:14,939
“You’re surprising me now,” I said.

3177
02:50:14,939 --> 02:50:16,107
“What’s it all about?”

3178
02:50:16,107 --> 02:50:18,820
“Oh, him and Trampas.”

3179
02:50:18,820 --> 02:50:19,407
“What?

3180
02:50:19,407 --> 02:50:20,758
Nothing surely happened yet?”

3181
02:50:20,758 --> 02:50:22,962
I was as curious as Scipio had been.

3182
02:50:22,962 --> 02:50:24,862
“No, not yet.

3183
02:50:24,862 --> 02:50:26,216
But there will.”

3184
02:50:26,216 --> 02:50:27,542
“Great Heavens, man!

3185
02:50:27,542 --> 02:50:28,124
when?”

3186
02:50:28,124 --> 02:50:33,122
“Just as soon as Trampas makes the first
move,” Scipio replied easily.

3187
02:50:33,122 --> 02:50:34,747
I became dignified.

3188
02:50:34,747 --> 02:50:39,227
Scipio had evidently been told
things by the Virginian.

3189
02:50:39,227 --> 02:50:44,083
“Yes, I up and asked him
plumb out,” Scipio answered.

3190
02:50:44,083 --> 02:50:48,587
“I was liftin’ his trunk in at the door,
and I couldn’t stand it no longer,

3191
02:50:48,587 --> 02:50:50,243
and I asked him plumb out.

3192
02:50:50,243 --> 02:50:53,053
‘Yu’ve sure got Trampas
where yu’ want him.’

3193
02:50:53,053 --> 02:50:54,844
That’s what I said.

3194
02:50:54,844 --> 02:50:57,414
And he up and answered and told me.

3195
02:50:57,414 --> 02:50:58,470
So I know.”

3196
02:50:58,470 --> 02:51:01,881
At this point Scipio stopped;
I was not to know.

3197
02:51:01,881 --> 02:51:04,994
“I had no idea,” I said,
“that your system held so much

3198
02:51:04,994 --> 02:51:06,016
meanness.”

3199
02:51:06,016 --> 02:51:09,068
“Oh, it ain’t meanness!”

3200
02:51:09,068 --> 02:51:11,090
And he laughed ecstatically.

3201
02:51:11,090 --> 02:51:12,643
“What do you call it, then?”

3202
02:51:12,643 --> 02:51:16,844
“He’d call it discretion,” said Scipio.

3203
02:51:16,844 --> 02:51:18,684
Then he became serious.

3204
02:51:18,684 --> 02:51:20,825
“It’s too blamed grand to tell yu’.

3205
02:51:20,825 --> 02:51:23,286
I’ll leave yu’ to see it happen.

3206
02:51:23,286 --> 02:51:26,486
Keep around, that’s all.

3207
02:51:26,486 --> 02:51:27,445
Keep around.

3208
02:51:27,445 --> 02:51:29,608
I pretty near wish I didn’t
know it myself.”

3209
02:51:29,608 --> 02:51:34,477
What with my feelings at Scipio’s
discretion, and my human curiosity,

3210
02:51:34,477 --> 02:51:37,506
I was not in that mood which best
profits from a sermon.

3211
02:51:37,506 --> 02:51:42,460
Yet even though my expectations had been
cruelly left quivering in mid air,

3212
02:51:42,460 --> 02:51:46,959
I was not sure how much I really
wanted to “keep around.”

3213
02:51:46,959 --> 02:51:52,079
You will therefore understand how Dr.
MacBride was able to make a prayer and

3214
02:51:52,079 --> 02:51:57,835
to read Scripture without my being
conscious of a word that he had uttered.

3215
02:51:57,835 --> 02:52:02,182
It was when I saw him opening the
manuscript of his sermon that I suddenly

3216
02:52:02,182 --> 02:52:05,877
remembered I was sitting,
so to speak, in church,

3217
02:52:05,877 --> 02:52:09,923
and began once more to think of the
preacher and his congregation.

3218
02:52:09,923 --> 02:52:15,051
Our chairs were in the front line,
of course; but, being next the wall,

3219
02:52:15,051 --> 02:52:17,860
I could easily see the cowboys behind
me.

3220
02:52:17,860 --> 02:52:19,731
They were perfectly decorous.

3221
02:52:19,731 --> 02:52:24,123
If Mrs. Ogden had looked for pistols,
daredevil attitudes,

3222
02:52:24,123 --> 02:52:27,124
and so forth, she must
have been greatly disappointed.

3223
02:52:27,124 --> 02:52:30,784
Except for their weather-beaten cheeks
and eyes, they were simply American

3224
02:52:30,784 --> 02:52:34,286
young men with mustaches and without,
and might have been sitting,

3225
02:52:34,286 --> 02:52:36,766
say, in Danbury, Connecticut.

3226
02:52:36,766 --> 02:52:41,807
Even Trampas merged quietly
with the general placidity.

3227
02:52:41,807 --> 02:52:45,651
The Virginian did not,
to be sure, look like Danbury,

3228
02:52:45,651 --> 02:52:50,322
and his frame and his features showed
out of the mass; but his eyes were upon

3229
02:52:50,322 --> 02:52:53,814
Dr. MacBride with a creamlike propriety.

3230
02:52:53,814 --> 02:52:57,574
Our missionary did not
choose Miss Wood’s text.

3231
02:52:57,574 --> 02:53:02,107
He made his selection from another of the
Psalms; and when it came,

3232
02:53:02,107 --> 02:53:05,987
I did not dare to look at anybody;
I was much nearer unseemly

3233
02:53:05,987 --> 02:53:08,074
conduct than the cowboys.

3234
02:53:08,074 --> 02:53:08,227
Dr.

3235
02:53:08,227 --> 02:53:13,208
MacBride gave us his text sonorously,
“ ‘They are altogether become filthy;

3236
02:53:13,208 --> -1:59:59,000
There is none of them that doeth
good, no, not one.’

3237
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3238
02:53:16,587 --> 02:53:21,326
His eye showed us plainly that present
company was not excepted from this.

3239
02:53:21,326 --> 02:53:25,563
He repeated the text once more,
then, launching upon his discourse,

3240
02:53:25,563 --> 02:53:28,469
gave none of us a ray of hope.

3241
02:53:28,469 --> 02:53:34,131
I had heard it all often before;
but preached to cowboys it took on a new

3242
02:53:34,131 --> 02:53:39,494
glare of untimeliness,
of grotesque obsoleteness⁠—as if someone

3243
02:53:39,494 --> 02:53:44,707
should say, “Let me persuade you to
admire woman,” and forthwith hold out

3244
02:53:44,707 --> 02:53:46,516
her bleached bones to you.

3245
02:53:46,516 --> 02:53:51,369
The cowboys were told that not only they
could do no good, but that if they did

3246
02:53:51,369 --> 02:53:53,609
contrive to, it would not help them.

3247
02:53:53,609 --> 02:54:01,136
Nay, more: not only honest deeds availed
them nothing, but even if they accepted

3248
02:54:01,136 --> 02:54:06,949
this especial creed which was being
explained to them as necessary for

3249
02:54:06,949 --> 02:54:10,455
salvation, still it might not save them.

3250
02:54:10,455 --> 02:54:15,689
Their sin was indeed the cause of their
damnation, yet, keeping from sin,

3251
02:54:15,689 --> 02:54:17,985
they might nevertheless be lost.

3252
02:54:17,985 --> 02:54:21,240
It had all been settled for them not only
before they were born,

3253
02:54:21,240 --> 02:54:22,718
but before Adam was shaped.

3254
02:54:22,718 --> 02:54:26,957
Having told them this,
he invited them to glorify the

3255
02:54:26,957 --> 02:54:29,544
Creator of the scheme.

3256
02:54:29,544 --> 02:54:32,709
Even if damned, they must praise the
person who had made them

3257
02:54:32,709 --> 02:54:34,549
expressly for damnation.

3258
02:54:34,549 --> 02:54:38,495
That is what I heard him prove by
logic to these cowboys.

3259
02:54:38,495 --> 02:54:42,905
Stone upon stone he built the black
cellar of his theology,

3260
02:54:42,905 --> 02:54:47,422
leaving out its beautiful park and the
sunshine of its garden.

3261
02:54:47,422 --> 02:54:51,964
He did not tell them the splendor of its
past, the noble fortress for good that

3262
02:54:51,964 --> 02:54:55,365
it had been, how its tonic had
strengthened generations

3263
02:54:55,365 --> 02:54:56,150
of their fathers.

3264
02:54:56,150 --> 02:55:00,106
No; wrath he spoke of,
and never once of love.

3265
02:55:00,106 --> 02:55:04,746
It was the bishop’s way,
I knew well, to hold cowboys by homely

3266
02:55:04,746 --> 02:55:08,060
talk of their special
hardships and temptations.

3267
02:55:08,060 --> 02:55:12,269
And when they fell he spoke to them of
forgiveness and brought

3268
02:55:12,269 --> 02:55:13,591
them encouragement.

3269
02:55:13,591 --> 02:55:18,743
But Dr. MacBride never thought once of
the lives of these waifs.

3270
02:55:18,743 --> 02:55:23,792
Like himself, like all mankind,
they were invisible dots in creation;

3271
02:55:23,792 --> 02:55:26,712
like him, they were to feel as nothing,
to be swept up in the potent

3272
02:55:26,712 --> 02:55:26,752
heat of his faith.

3273
02:55:26,752 --> 02:55:30,497
So he thrust out to them none of the
sweet but all the bitter of his creed,

3274
02:55:30,497 --> 02:55:33,159
naked and stern as iron.

3275
02:55:33,159 --> 02:55:37,118
Dogma was his all in all,
and poor humanity was nothing but

3276
02:55:37,118 --> 02:55:39,022
flesh for its canons.

3277
02:55:39,022 --> 02:55:44,450
Thus to kill what chance he had for being
of use seemed to me more deplorable than

3278
02:55:44,450 --> 02:55:46,075
it did evidently to them.

3279
02:55:46,075 --> 02:55:48,416
Their attention merely wandered.

3280
02:55:48,416 --> 02:55:51,690
Three hundred years ago they would have
been frightened; but not

3281
02:55:51,690 --> 02:55:53,051
in this electric day.

3282
02:55:53,051 --> 02:55:59,421
I saw Scipio stifling a smile when it
came to the doctrine of original sin.

3283
02:55:59,421 --> 02:56:03,735
“We know of its truth,”
said Dr. MacBride, “from the severe

3284
02:56:03,735 --> 02:56:09,767
troubles and distresses to which infants
are liable, and from death passing upon

3285
02:56:09,767 --> -1:59:59,000
them before they are capable of sinning.

3286
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3287
02:56:12,202 --> 02:56:16,767
Yet I knew he was a good man;
and I also knew that if a missionary is

3288
02:56:16,767 --> 02:56:20,466
to be tactless, he might almost
as well be bad.

3289
02:56:20,466 --> 02:56:23,887
I said their attention wandered,
but I forgot the Virginian.

3290
02:56:23,887 --> 02:56:29,129
At first his attitude might
have been mere propriety.

3291
02:56:29,129 --> 02:56:34,065
One can look respectfully at a preacher
and be internally breaking

3292
02:56:34,065 --> 02:56:35,612
all the commandments.

3293
02:56:35,612 --> 02:56:39,792
But even with the text I saw real
attention light in the Virginian’s eye.

3294
02:56:39,792 --> 02:56:44,667
And keeping track of the concentration
that grew on him with each minute made

3295
02:56:44,667 --> 02:56:46,237
the sermon short for me.

3296
02:56:46,237 --> 02:56:47,942
He missed nothing.

3297
02:56:47,942 --> 02:56:52,558
Before the end his gaze at the
preacher had become swerveless.

3298
02:56:52,558 --> 02:56:56,252
Was he convert or critic?

3299
02:56:56,252 --> 02:56:58,252
Convert was incredible.

3300
02:56:58,252 --> 02:57:05,352
Thus was an hour passed before I
had thought of time.

3301
02:57:05,352 --> 02:57:09,693
When it was over we took it variously.

3302
02:57:09,693 --> 02:57:14,227
The preacher was genial and spoke of
having now broken ground for the lessons

3303
02:57:14,227 --> 02:57:15,649
that he hoped to instill.

3304
02:57:15,649 --> 02:57:19,867
He discoursed for a while about trout-
fishing and about the rumored uneasiness

3305
02:57:19,867 --> 02:57:22,200
of the Indians northward
where he was going.

3306
02:57:22,200 --> 02:57:25,998
It was plain that his personal safety
never gave him a thought.

3307
02:57:25,998 --> 02:57:28,428
He soon bade us good night.

3308
02:57:28,428 --> 02:57:31,938
The Ogdens shrugged their
shoulders and were amused.

3309
02:57:31,938 --> 02:57:33,751
That was their way of taking it.

3310
02:57:33,751 --> 02:57:34,316
Dr.

3311
02:57:34,316 --> 02:57:38,131
MacBride sat too heavily on the Judge’s
shoulders for him to shrug them.

3312
02:57:38,131 --> 02:57:43,653
As a leading citizen in the Territory he
kept open house for all comers.

3313
02:57:43,653 --> 02:57:49,553
Policy and good nature made him bid
welcome a wide variety of travellers.

3314
02:57:49,553 --> 02:57:54,342
The cowboy out of employment found bed
and a meal for himself and his horse,

3315
02:57:54,342 --> 02:57:59,241
and missionaries had before now been
well received at Sunk Creek Ranch.

3316
02:57:59,241 --> 02:58:03,151
“I suppose I’ll have to take him
fishing,” said the Judge, ruefully.

3317
02:58:03,151 --> 02:58:06,002
“Yes, my dear,” said his wife, “you will.

3318
02:58:06,002 --> 02:58:08,772
And I shall have to make his
tea for six days.”

3319
02:58:08,772 --> 02:58:11,962
“Otherwise,” Ogden suggested,
“it might be reported that you

3320
02:58:11,962 --> 02:58:13,442
were enemies of religion.”

3321
02:58:13,442 --> 02:58:15,042
“That’s about it,” said the Judge.

3322
02:58:15,042 --> 02:58:17,621
“I can get on with most people.

3323
02:58:17,621 --> 02:58:20,057
But elephants depress me.”

3324
02:58:20,057 --> 02:58:24,795
So we named the Doctor “Jumbo,”
and I departed to my quarters.

3325
02:58:24,795 --> 02:58:30,634
At the bunk house, the comments were
similar but more highly salted.

3326
02:58:30,634 --> 02:58:32,320
The men were going to bed.

3327
02:58:32,320 --> 02:58:36,763
In spite of their outward decorum at the
service, they had not liked to be told

3328
02:58:36,763 --> 02:58:43,874
that they were “altogether
become filthy.”

3329
02:58:44,006 --> 02:58:52,212
It was easy to call names;
they could do that themselves.

3330
02:58:52,212 --> 02:59:02,497
And they appealed to me,
several speaking at once,

3331
02:59:02,497 --> 02:59:09,742
like a concerted piece at the opera:
“Say, do you believe babies go to hell?”

3332
02:59:09,742 --> 02:59:15,262
⁠—“Ah, of course he don’t.”
⁠—“There ain’t no hereafter,

3333
02:59:15,262 --> 02:59:24,102
anyway.”⁠—“Ain’t there?”⁠—“Who told
yu’?”⁠—“Same man as told the preacher we

3334
02:59:24,102 --> 02:59:31,269
were all a sifted set of sons-of-guns.

3335
02:59:31,269 --> 02:59:35,133
”⁠—“Well, I’m going to stay a Mormon.

3336
02:59:35,133 --> 02:59:43,227
”⁠—“Well, I’m going to quit
fleeing from temptation.”⁠—“that

3337
02:59:43,227 --> 02:59:44,667
’s so!

3338
02:59:44,667 --> 02:59:50,488
Better get it in the neck after a good
time than a poor one.”

3339
02:59:50,488 --> 02:59:53,085
And so forth.

3340
02:59:53,085 --> 02:59:59,979
Their wit was not extreme,
yet I should like Dr. MacBride

3341
02:59:59,979 --> 03:00:02,372
to have heard it.

3342
03:00:02,372 --> 03:00:11,453
One fellow put his natural soul pretty
well into words, “If I happened to learn

3343
03:00:11,453 --> 03:00:16,757
what they had predestinated me to do,
I’d do the other thing,

3344
03:00:16,757 --> 03:00:19,599
just to show ’em!”

3345
03:00:19,599 --> 03:00:21,749
And Trampas?

3346
03:00:21,749 --> 03:00:23,710
And the Virginian?

3347
03:00:23,710 --> 03:00:25,669
They were out of it.

3348
03:00:25,669 --> 03:00:30,340
The Virginian had gone straight
to his new abode.

3349
03:00:30,340 --> 03:00:38,902
Trampas lay in his bed,
not asleep, and sullen as ever.

3350
03:00:38,902 --> 03:00:44,342
“He ain’t got religion this trip,”
said Scipio to me.

3351
03:00:44,342 --> 03:00:47,622
“Did his new foreman get it?”

3352
03:00:47,622 --> 03:00:49,222
I asked.

3353
03:00:49,222 --> 03:00:50,382
“Huh!

3354
03:00:50,382 --> 03:00:53,083
It would spoil him.

3355
03:00:53,083 --> 03:00:55,603
You keep around that’s all.

3356
03:00:55,603 --> 03:00:56,923
Keep around.”

3357
03:00:56,923 --> 03:01:04,286
Scipio was not to be probed;
and I went, still baffled, to my repose.

3358
03:01:04,286 --> 03:01:11,047
No light burned in the cabin as
I approached its door.

3359
03:01:11,047 --> 03:01:22,106
The Virginian’s room was quiet and dark;
and that Dr. MacBride slumbered was

3360
03:01:22,106 --> 03:01:31,299
plainly audible to me,
even before I entered.

3361
03:01:31,299 --> -1:59:59,000
Go fishing with him

3362
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
!

3363
03:01:35,459 --> 03:01:39,672
I thought, as I undressed.

3364
03:01:39,672 --> 03:01:45,376
And I selfishly decided that the Judge
might have this privilege

3365
03:01:45,376 --> 03:01:48,639
entirely to himself.

3366
03:01:48,639 --> 03:01:54,619
Sleep came to me fairly soon,
in spite of the Doctor.

3367
03:01:54,619 --> 03:02:05,113
I was wakened from it by my bed’s being
jolted⁠—not a pleasant thing that night.

3368
03:02:05,113 --> 03:02:08,095
I must have started.

3369
03:02:08,095 --> 03:02:14,418
And it was the quiet voice of the
Virginian that told me he was sorry to

3370
03:02:14,418 --> 03:02:19,872
have accidentally disturbed me.

3371
03:02:19,872 --> 03:02:24,152
This disturbed me a good deal more.

3372
03:02:24,152 --> 03:02:30,376
But his steps did not go to the bunk
house, as my sensational

3373
03:02:30,376 --> 03:02:34,248
mind had suggested.

3374
03:02:34,248 --> 03:02:37,559
He was not wearing much,
and in the dimness he

3375
03:02:37,559 --> 03:02:41,552
seemed taller than common.

3376
03:02:41,552 --> 03:02:53,750
I next made out that he was
bending over Dr. MacBride.

3377
03:02:53,750 --> 03:02:57,721
The divine at last sprang upright.

3378
03:02:57,721 --> 03:03:00,761
“I am armed,” he said.

3379
03:03:00,761 --> 03:03:03,548
“Take care.

3380
03:03:03,548 --> 03:03:05,578
Who are you?”

3381
03:03:05,578 --> 03:03:09,978
“You can lay down your gun, seh.

3382
03:03:09,978 --> 03:03:15,778
I feel like my spirit was
going to bear witness.

3383
03:03:15,778 --> 03:03:21,258
I feel like I might get an enlightening.”

3384
03:03:21,310 --> 03:03:28,190
He was using some of the
missionary’s own language.

3385
03:03:28,190 --> 03:03:38,135
The baffling I had been treated to by
Scipio melted to nothing in this.

3386
03:03:38,135 --> 03:03:47,526
Did living men petrify,
I should have changed to

3387
03:03:47,526 --> 03:03:50,446
mineral between the sheets.

3388
03:03:50,446 --> 03:03:59,078
The Doctor got out of bed,
lighted his lamp, and found a book;

3389
03:03:59,078 --> 03:04:06,529
and the two retired into the Virginian’s
room, where I could hear the

3390
03:04:06,529 --> 03:04:11,259
exhortations as I lay amazed.

3391
03:04:11,259 --> 03:04:19,740
In time the Doctor returned,
blew out his lamp, and settled himself.

3392
03:04:19,740 --> 03:04:27,912
I had been very much awake,
but was nearly gone to sleep again,

3393
03:04:27,912 --> 03:04:35,052
when the door creaked and the Virginian
stood by the Doctor’s side.

3394
03:04:35,052 --> 03:04:37,345
“Are you awake, seh?”

3395
03:04:37,345 --> 03:04:38,457
“What?

3396
03:04:38,457 --> 03:04:41,718
What’s that?

3397
03:04:41,718 --> 03:04:44,880
What is it?”

3398
03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:47,360
“Excuse me, seh.

3399
03:04:47,360 --> 03:04:49,372
The enemy is winning on me.

3400
03:04:49,372 --> 03:04:53,892
I’m feeling less inward
opposition to sin.”

3401
03:04:53,892 --> 03:04:58,230
The lamp was lighted,
and I listened to some

3402
03:04:58,230 --> 03:05:03,786
further exhortations.

3403
03:05:04,617 --> 03:05:08,857
They must have taken half an hour.

3404
03:05:08,857 --> 03:05:17,419
When the Doctor was in bed again,
I thought that I heard him sigh.

3405
03:05:17,419 --> 03:05:33,186
This upset my composure in the dark;
but I lay face downward in the pillow,

3406
03:05:33,186 --> 03:05:38,029
and the Doctor was soon again snoring.

3407
03:05:38,029 --> 03:05:44,949
I envied him for a while his
faculty of easy sleep.

3408
03:05:44,949 --> 03:05:56,464
But I must have dropped off myself;
for it was the lamp in my eyes that now

3409
03:05:56,464 --> 03:06:03,475
waked me as he came back for the third
time from the Virginian’s room.

3410
03:06:03,475 --> 03:06:12,795
Before blowing the light out he looked at
his watch, and thereupon I inquired

3411
03:06:12,795 --> 03:06:15,195
the hour of him.

3412
03:06:15,195 --> 03:06:17,515
“Three,” said he.

3413
03:06:17,515 --> 03:06:22,675
I could not sleep any more now,
and I lay watching the darkness.

3414
03:06:22,675 --> 03:06:26,115
“I’m afeared to be alone!”

3415
03:06:26,115 --> 03:06:33,371
said the Virginian’s voice presently
in the next room.

3416
03:06:33,371 --> 03:06:34,921
“I’m afeared.”

3417
03:06:34,921 --> 03:06:43,863
There was a short pause,
and then he shouted very loud,

3418
03:06:43,863 --> 03:06:51,468
“I’m losin’ my desire afteh the sincere
milk of the Word!”

3419
03:06:51,468 --> 03:06:52,975
“What?

3420
03:06:52,975 --> 03:06:54,574
What’s that?

3421
03:06:54,574 --> 03:06:56,877
What?”

3422
03:06:56,877 --> 03:07:07,538
The Doctor’s cot gave a great crack as he
started up listening,

3423
03:07:07,538 --> 03:07:11,138
and I put my face deep in the pillow.

3424
03:07:11,138 --> 03:07:13,098
“I’m afeared!

3425
03:07:13,098 --> 03:07:15,458
I’m afeared!

3426
03:07:15,458 --> 03:07:22,298
Sin has quit being bitter in my belly.”

3427
03:07:22,618 --> 03:07:26,258
“Courage, my good man.”

3428
03:07:26,258 --> 03:07:35,258
The Doctor was out of bed with his lamp
again, and the door shut behind him.

3429
03:07:35,258 --> 03:07:40,411
Between them they made it long this time.

3430
03:07:40,411 --> 03:07:47,313
I saw the window become gray;
then the corners of the furniture grow

3431
03:07:47,313 --> 03:07:52,473
visible; and outside,
the dry chorus of the blackbirds began

3432
03:07:52,473 --> 03:07:54,513
to fill the dawn.

3433
03:07:54,513 --> 03:08:02,047
To these the sounds of chickens and
impatient hoofs in the stable were

3434
03:08:02,047 --> 03:08:08,588
added, and some cow wandered by loudly
calling for her calf.

3435
03:08:08,588 --> 03:08:16,953
Next, someone whistling passed
near and grew distant.

3436
03:08:16,953 --> 03:08:22,514
But although the cold hue that I lay
staring at through the window warmed and

3437
03:08:22,514 --> 03:08:31,034
changed, the Doctor continued working
hard over his patient in the next room.

3438
03:08:31,034 --> 03:08:39,597
Only a word here and there was distinct;
but it was plain from the Virginian’s

3439
03:08:39,597 --> 03:08:46,409
fewer remarks that the sin in his belly
was alarming him less.

3440
03:08:46,409 --> 03:08:49,679
Yes, they made this time long.

3441
03:08:49,679 --> 03:08:55,371
But it proved, indeed, the last one.

3442
03:08:55,371 --> 03:09:01,146
And though some sort of catastrophe was
bound to fall upon us,

3443
03:09:01,146 --> 03:09:08,306
it was myself who precipitated the
thing that did happen.

3444
03:09:08,306 --> 03:09:11,898
Day was wholly come.

3445
03:09:11,898 --> 03:09:17,871
I looked at my own watch, and it was six.

3446
03:09:17,871 --> 03:09:26,002
I had been about seven hours in my bed,
and the Doctor had been about seven

3447
03:09:26,002 --> 03:09:28,002
hours out of his.

3448
03:09:28,002 --> 03:09:35,720
The door opened, and he came in with
his book and lamp.

3449
03:09:35,720 --> 03:09:40,680
He seemed to be shivering a little,
and I saw him cast a longing

3450
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:42,641
eye at his couch.

3451
03:09:42,641 --> 03:09:50,521
But the Virginian followed him even as he
blew out the now quite superfluous

3452
03:09:50,521 --> 03:09:51,572
light.

3453
03:09:51,572 --> 03:09:58,646
They made a noticeable couple in their
underclothes: the Virginian with his

3454
03:09:58,646 --> 03:10:03,665
lean racehorse shanks running to a point
at his ankle, and the Doctor with his

3455
03:10:03,665 --> 03:10:08,952
stomach and his fat sedentary calves.

3456
03:10:08,952 --> 03:10:15,961
“You’ll be going to breakfast and the
ladies, seh, pretty soon,”

3457
03:10:15,961 --> 03:10:24,550
said the Virginian, with
a chastened voice.

3458
03:10:24,550 --> 03:10:34,784
“But I’ll worry through the
day somehow without yu’.

3459
03:10:34,784 --> 03:10:39,945
And tonight you can turn your wolf
loose on me again.”

3460
03:10:39,945 --> 03:10:43,319
Once more it was no use.

3461
03:10:43,319 --> 03:10:51,446
My face was deep in the pillow,
but I made sounds as of a hen who

3462
03:10:51,446 --> 03:10:54,488
has laid an egg.

3463
03:10:54,488 --> 03:11:06,789
It broke on the Doctor with a total
instantaneous smash, quite like an egg.

3464
03:11:06,789 --> 03:11:10,829
He tried to speak calmly.

3465
03:11:10,829 --> 03:11:13,052
“This is a disgrace.

3466
03:11:13,052 --> 03:11:15,212
An infamous disgrace.

3467
03:11:15,212 --> 03:11:26,222
Never in my life have I⁠—” Words forsook
him, and his face grew redder.

3468
03:11:26,222 --> 03:11:28,618
“Never in my life⁠—”

3469
03:11:28,618 --> 03:11:37,893
He stopped again, because,
at the sight of him being dignified in

3470
03:11:37,893 --> 03:11:48,065
his red drawers, I was making the noise
of a dozen hens.

3471
03:11:48,065 --> 03:11:53,247
It was suddenly too much
for the Virginian.

3472
03:11:53,247 --> 03:11:57,687
He hastened into his room,
and there sank on the floor with his

3473
03:11:57,687 --> 03:11:59,927
head in his hands.

3474
03:11:59,927 --> 03:12:07,762
The Doctor immediately slammed the door
upon him, and this rendered me easily

3475
03:12:07,762 --> 03:12:10,847
fit for a lunatic asylum.

3476
03:12:10,847 --> 03:12:15,922
I cried into my pillow,
and wondered if the Doctor would

3477
03:12:15,922 --> 03:12:18,522
come and kill me.

3478
03:12:18,522 --> 03:12:27,525
But he took no notice of me whatever.

3479
03:12:27,525 --> 03:12:35,793
I could hear the Virginian’s convulsions
through the door, and also

3480
03:12:35,793 --> 03:12:39,113
the Doctor furiously making

3481
03:12:39,113 --> 03:12:43,444
his toilet within three feet of my head

3482
03:12:43,444 --> 03:12:49,276
; and I lay quite still with my face the
other way, for I was really afraid

3483
03:12:49,276 --> 03:12:53,270
to look at him.

3484
03:12:53,270 --> 03:13:06,094
When I heard him walk to the door in his
boots, I ventured to peep;

3485
03:13:06,094 --> 03:13:14,228
and there he was, going out with his
bag in his hand.

3486
03:13:14,228 --> 03:13:20,979
As I still continued to lie,
weak and sore, and with a mind that had

3487
03:13:20,979 --> 03:13:27,692
ceased all operation,
the Virginian’s door opened.

3488
03:13:27,692 --> 03:13:43,692
He was clean and dressed and decent,
but the devil still sported in his eye.

3489
03:13:43,692 --> 03:13:52,023
I have never seen a creature
more irresistibly handsome.

3490
03:13:52,023 --> 03:13:57,863
Then my mind worked again.

3491
03:13:57,863 --> 03:14:01,001
“You’ve gone and done it,” said I.

3492
03:14:01,001 --> 03:14:03,703
“He’s packed his valise.

3493
03:14:03,703 --> 03:14:06,063
He’ll not sleep here.”

3494
03:14:06,063 --> 03:14:13,263
The Virginian looked quickly
out of the door.

3495
03:14:14,863 --> 03:14:18,463
“Why, he’s leavin’ us!”

3496
03:14:18,463 --> 03:14:20,545
he exclaimed.

3497
03:14:20,545 --> 03:14:28,345
“Drivin’ away right now in
his little old buggy!”

3498
03:14:29,725 --> 03:14:39,779
He turned to me, and our eyes met
solemnly over this large fact.

3499
03:14:39,779 --> 03:14:46,810
I thought that I perceived the faintest
tincture of dismay in the features of

3500
03:14:46,810 --> 03:14:59,551
Judge Henry’s new, responsible,
trusty foreman.

3501
03:14:59,551 --> 03:15:06,397
This was the first act
of his administration.

3502
03:15:06,397 --> 03:15:13,454
Once again he looked out
at the departing missionary.

3503
03:15:13,454 --> -1:59:59,000
“Well,” he vindictively stated,
“I cert’nly ain’t goin’ to run afteh him

3504
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.”

3505
03:15:21,125 --> 03:15:24,471
And he looked at me again.

3506
03:15:24,471 --> 03:15:27,581
“Do you suppose the Judge knows?”

3507
03:15:27,581 --> 03:15:30,066
I inquired.

3508
03:15:30,066 --> 03:15:32,946
He shook his head.

3509
03:15:32,946 --> 03:15:38,825
“The windo’ shades is all
down still oveh yondeh.”

3510
03:15:38,825 --> 03:15:42,944
He paused.

3511
03:15:43,312 --> 03:15:51,188
“I don’t care,” he stated,
quite as if he had been ten years old.

3512
03:15:51,188 --> 03:15:55,814
Then he grinned guiltily.

3513
03:15:55,814 --> 03:16:00,597
“I was mighty respectful
to him all night.”

3514
03:16:00,597 --> 03:16:05,271
“Oh, yes, respectful!

3515
03:16:05,271 --> 03:16:10,614
Especially when you invited him to
turn his wolf loose.”

3516
03:16:10,614 --> 03:16:15,739
The Virginian gave a joyous gulp.

3517
03:16:15,739 --> 03:16:22,025
He now came and sat down on the
edge of my bed.

3518
03:16:22,025 --> 03:16:29,883
“I spoke awful good English to him most
of the time,” said he.

3519
03:16:29,883 --> 03:16:37,356
“I can, yu’ know, when I cinch my
attention tight on to it.

3520
03:16:37,356 --> 03:16:44,569
Yes, I cert’nly spoke a
lot o’ good English.

3521
03:16:44,569 --> 03:16:50,356
I didn’t understand some of it myself!”

3522
03:16:50,356 --> 03:16:55,583
He was now growing frankly
pleased with his exploit.

3523
03:16:55,583 --> 03:17:00,751
He had builded so much
better than he knew.

3524
03:17:00,751 --> 03:17:14,279
He got up and looked out across the
crystal world of light.

3525
03:17:14,279 --> 03:17:21,830
“The Doctor is at one-
mile crossing,” he said.

3526
03:17:21,830 --> 03:17:30,317
“He’ll get breakfast at the N-lazy-Y.”

3527
03:17:30,317 --> 03:17:41,359
Then he returned and sat again on my bed,
and began to give me his real heart.

3528
03:17:41,359 --> 03:17:46,959
“I never set up for being
better than others.

3529
03:17:46,959 --> 03:17:53,235
Not even to myself.

3530
03:17:53,235 --> 03:18:01,805
My thoughts ain’t apt to
travel around making comparisons.

3531
03:18:01,805 --> 03:18:10,499
And I shouldn’t wonder if my memory took
as much notice of the meannesses I have

3532
03:18:10,499 --> 03:18:13,631
done as of⁠—as of the other actions.

3533
03:18:13,631 --> 03:18:21,527
But to have to sit like a dumb lamb and
let a stranger tell yu’ for an hour that

3534
03:18:21,527 --> 03:18:27,898
yu’re a hawg and a swine,
just after you have acted in a way which

3535
03:18:27,898 --> 03:18:36,573
them that know the facts would
call pretty near white⁠—”

3536
03:18:36,573 --> 03:18:41,117
“Trampas!”

3537
03:18:41,117 --> 03:18:47,914
I could not help exclaiming.

3538
03:18:49,914 --> 03:18:58,354
For there are moments of insight when a
guess amounts to knowledge.

3539
03:18:59,014 --> 03:19:02,983
“Has Scipio told⁠—”

3540
03:19:02,983 --> 03:19:04,823
“No.

3541
03:19:04,823 --> 03:19:06,143
Not a word.

3542
03:19:06,143 --> 03:19:09,566
He wouldn’t tell me.”

3543
03:19:09,566 --> 03:19:16,658
“Well, yu’ see, I arrived home hyeh this
evenin’ with several thoughts workin’

3544
03:19:16,658 --> 03:19:20,018
and stirrin’ inside me.

3545
03:19:20,018 --> 03:19:27,093
And not one o’ them thoughts was
what yu’d call Christian.

3546
03:19:27,093 --> 03:19:32,535
I ain’t the least little
bit ashamed of ’em.

3547
03:19:32,535 --> 03:19:36,775
I’m a human.

3548
03:19:36,999 --> 03:19:44,450
But after the Judge⁠—well, yu’ heard him.

3549
03:19:44,450 --> 03:19:54,183
And so when I went away from that talk
and saw how positions was changed⁠—”

3550
03:19:54,183 --> 03:19:59,740
A step outside stopped him short.

3551
03:19:59,740 --> 03:20:05,691
Nothing more could be read in his face,
for there was Trampas himself

3552
03:20:05,691 --> 03:20:09,111
in the open door.

3553
03:20:09,111 --> 03:20:17,367
“Good morning,” said Trampas,
not looking at us.

3554
03:20:17,367 --> 03:20:22,403
He spoke with the same
cool sullenness of yesterday.

3555
03:20:22,403 --> 03:20:25,563
We returned his greeting.

3556
03:20:25,563 --> 03:20:35,292
“I believe I’m late in congratulating you
on your promotion,” said he.

3557
03:20:35,292 --> 03:20:39,213
The Virginian consulted his watch.

3558
03:20:39,213 --> 03:20:47,879
“It’s only half afteh six,” he returned.

3559
03:20:47,879 --> 03:20:52,388
Trampas’s sullenness deepened.

3560
03:20:52,388 --> 03:21:00,668
“Any man is to be congratulated on
getting a rise, I expect.”

3561
03:21:00,668 --> 03:21:05,979
This time the Virginian let him have it.

3562
03:21:05,979 --> 03:21:07,472
“Cert’nly.

3563
03:21:07,472 --> 03:21:13,031
And I ain’t forgetting how much I
owe mine to you.”

3564
03:21:13,031 --> 03:21:24,007
Trampas would have liked
to let himself go.

3565
03:21:24,007 --> 03:21:31,385
“I’ve not come here for
any forgiveness,” he sneered.

3566
03:21:31,385 --> 03:21:39,880
“When did yu’ feel yu’ needed any?”

3567
03:21:39,972 --> 03:21:53,362
The Virginian was impregnable.

3568
03:21:53,362 --> 03:22:03,510
Trampas seemed to feel how little he
was gaining this way.

3569
03:22:03,510 --> 03:22:13,180
He came out straight now.

3570
03:22:13,180 --> 03:22:19,180
“Oh, I haven’t any Judge
behind me, I know.

3571
03:22:19,180 --> 03:22:34,032
I heard you’d be paying the boys this
morning, and I’ve come for my time.”

3572
03:22:34,666 --> 03:22:41,519
“You’re thinking of leaving us?”

3573
03:22:41,519 --> 03:22:44,599
asked the new foreman.

3574
03:22:44,599 --> 03:22:49,744
“What’s your dissatisfaction?”

3575
03:22:49,744 --> 03:22:54,352
“Oh, I’m not needing anybody back of me.

3576
03:22:54,352 --> 03:22:59,709
I’ll get along by myself.”

3577
03:22:59,709 --> 03:23:09,620
It was thus he revealed his expectation
of being dismissed by his enemy.

3578
03:23:09,620 --> 03:23:17,036
This would have knocked any meditated
generosity out of my heart.

3579
03:23:17,036 --> 03:23:22,019
But I was not the Virginian.

3580
03:23:22,019 --> 03:23:32,371
He shifted his legs, leaned back
a little, and laughed.

3581
03:23:32,371 --> 03:23:51,082
“Go back to your job,
Trampas, if that’s all your complaint.

3582
03:23:51,082 --> 03:23:56,023
You’re right about me being in luck.

3583
03:23:56,023 --> -1:59:59,000
But maybe there’s two of us in luck.

3584
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3585
03:24:00,683 --> 03:24:11,666
It was this that Scipio had preferred me
to see with my own eyes.

3586
03:24:11,666 --> 03:24:18,326
The fight was between man
and man no longer.

3587
03:24:18,326 --> 03:24:25,256
The case could not be one of forgiveness;
but the Virginian would not use his

3588
03:24:25,256 --> 03:24:32,534
official position to
crush his subordinate.

3589
03:24:32,534 --> 03:24:45,375
Trampas departed with something muttered
that I did not hear,

3590
03:24:45,375 --> 03:24:56,571
and the Virginian closed intimate
conversation by saying,

3591
03:24:56,571 --> 03:25:02,079
“You’ll be late for breakfast.”
