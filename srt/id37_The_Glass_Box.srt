00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,600
The Glass Box

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:12,800
Once there was a poor man. His name was 
Hans. He had no money, no house and no  

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:21,680
food, but he was happy. 'I'll find something,' he 
said. 'I'll walk down this road to the next town.'  

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,840
After a short time, a very old woman 
called to him from across the road.

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,040
'What do you want?' asked Hans.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,840
'What do you want?' said the old woman.

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,000
'What do I want? I want money.'

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:52,320
'You can have money,' said the old woman. 'Take 
this magic blue coat and climb to the top of that  

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:02,480
tall tree. Then climb down inside it. You will 
come into a large room with three hundred lights.  

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:11,600
There are three doors. Go through the first 
door and you will see a big box. On the box  

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:19,120
sits a dog with eyes as large as eggs. 
Don't be afraid - it won't hurt you.  

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,000
Put my blue coat on the floor. Take the dog and 
put it down on the coat in front of the box.  

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,600
Open the box and you will see money. Take some.

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,840
'Go through the second door 
and you will see a bigger box.  

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:50,320
On the box sits a dog with eyes as large as 
oranges. Don't be afraid - it won't hurt you.  

16
00:01:52,160 --> 00:02:01,280
Put the dog down on the coat in front of the box. 
Open the box and you will see gold. Take some.

17
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:11,840
'Go through the third door. There you will see 
the biggest box. On the box sits a dog with  

18
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:22,720
eyes as large as plates. Don't be afraid - it is 
friendly. There are jewels in its box. Take some.'

19
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,760
'This is wonderful,' said Hans. 
'But what can I do for you?'

20
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:40,560
'I don't want any money or gold or jewels,' said 
the old woman. 'I only want one little thing.  

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,320
In the third room, there is a small glass box. 
My grandmother lost it there. Bring me that box.'  

22
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:04,480
Hans climbed up the tree and then down inside the 
tree. He went down and down and down. Then he saw  

23
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:12,320
the three hundred lights and the three doors. He 
opened the first door and went into a little room.  

24
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,120
There, on a box, was a dog 
with eyes as large as eggs.

25
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:28,800
'Good dog!' said Hans. He remembered the old 
woman's words. He put her blue coat on the floor.  

26
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,080
He took the dog and put it down on the 
coat in front of the box. He opened the box  

27
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,480
and he got very excited. He took some money and 
put it in his hat. He put the dog back on the box  

28
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,640
and went into the second room.

29
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,280
There, on a box, was a dog 
with eyes as large as oranges.

30
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:03,920
'You're a fine dog!' said Hans. He put the dog 
down in front of the box, and opened the box. His  

31
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,840
eyes were suddenly as yellow as the gold in the 
box. Hans took some gold and put it in his hat.

32
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,720
Then he went into the last room. This 
dog's eyes were as large as plates.  

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,520
'You are a very fine dog!' he said. Hans looked at 
the jewels in the box. His eyes were suddenly red,  

34
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,800
blue, yellow, green and gold. He took 
some jewels and put them in his shoes.  

35
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,160
Then he remembered the old woman's glass box. 
He found it on the floor next to the dog.

36
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,760
He climbed up inside the tree again.  

37
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,400
It was harder this time with the heavy gold 
and jewels, but he got out of the tree.

38
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,400
'Throw down the box,' called the old woman 
when she saw him. But he did not throw it.  

39
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,400
Suddenly a stone hit him on the head.

40
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:17,200
'Help! I'm going to fall and die,' he thought. 
But he put out a hand and he did not fall.

41
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
'Did you throw that stone?' he called.

42
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,640
'Yes. Now give me the box.' 
She was not very friendly now.

43
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,040
'I'm not going to give it to you,' he answered.

44
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,880
The old woman got very angry and her face 
was very ugly. He climbed to the ground  

45
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:52,160
and walked away down the road. She called him 
names but he did not answer. She could do nothing.

46
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,200
It was night when he came to the town. He found 
a very nice room and asked for the best food.  

47
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,600
The next day he went out and bought beautiful 
clothes. He was a very important and rich man,  

48
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,200
people thought. He suddenly had many friends.

49
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,840
One day somebody asked him, 'Do 
you know about the princess?'

50
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,760
'What princess?' asked Hans. 'Who 
is she? Where does she live?'

51
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,840
'You cannot see her,' answered the man.

52
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,440
'Why not?'

53
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,400
'Because she is in a big house and she 
can't leave it. There is only one door.  

54
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,760
The windows are high up. She never goes 
out. The king says nobody can see her.'

55
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,400
'Why does she live in that way?' asked Hans.

56
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,720
'Because a clever old man said to the king, 
"Your daughter will marry a poor man."  

57
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:07,120
The king was very angry. He built the big house 
with high windows and shut the princess in it.'

58
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
'I want to see the princess,' said Hans.  

59
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:19,680
He found the house and went to the door. But 
the king's servants quickly sent him away.  

60
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,320
Then he put on his most expensive clothes and 
went to the king's home. The king was very angry.  

61
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,920
'Don't come near my house again,' he shouted. 'I 
will cut off your head and put it on a stick.'

62
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:47,120
Hans lived well at this time and quickly used 
his money. One day he only had two jewels.  

63
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:56,800
He left his nice room. He found a poor house and 
lived in it. Hans was poor now. Nobody cooked  

64
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:05,120
his food. Nobody cleaned his shoes. His rich 
'friends' did not invite him to their homes.  

65
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,840
He tried to find the tree with the three 
dogs again, but he couldn't find it.

66
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:20,880
After a short time Hans had no money. No 
money for food. He looked round his room.  

67
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,560
What could he sell? There, on the 
table, he saw the little glass box.

68
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,560
'Perhaps I can buy some bread with this,' 
he thought. 'Why did the old woman want  

69
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:47,520
it? It is glass but I can't see into it. 
Perhaps there are jewels or gold inside.'  

70
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,440
He tried to open the box but he 
couldn't. He hit it once with his hand.  

71
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,760
Suddenly the dog with eyes as large 
as eggs appeared in front of him.

72
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,840
'What do you want?' asked the dog.

73
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,360
'What do I want!' cried Hans. 'I want money!'

74
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:22,000
The dog went away. It quickly came 
back with a bag of money in its mouth.

75
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:32,800
Hans thought. Then he said, 'I know! The first 
dog comes when I hit the box once. The second  

76
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:40,800
dog will come when I hit the box again. The third 
dog will come when I hit the box three times.'

77
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:51,760
He hit the box - one, two - and the dog with 
eyes as large as oranges brought gold. He hit  

78
00:09:51,760 --> 00:10:00,320
the box three times - one, two, three - and the 
dog with eyes as large as plates brought jewels.

79
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,000
Hans was rich again. He bought beautiful 
clothes and moved to a big house.  

80
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,760
All his 'friends' came back.

81
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,160
'Why didn't you visit us?' 
they said. 'Where were you?'

82
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,720
Hans did not like these friends. He 
thought only of the sad princess.

83
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,440
'She can never go out,' he thought. 'She can 
never walk in the garden. Her mother is dead.  

84
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,640
She can only speak to the servants and 
the old king. She has an unhappy life.'

85
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:50,400
One night Hans could not sleep. Suddenly 
he had an idea and he got up from his bed.  

86
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,640
He took the glass box and 
hit it once. The dog came.

87
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,480
'It is night - a beautiful night,' said Hans,  

88
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:13,840
'and nobody will see. I know that the princess 
would like a walk in my garden. Bring her here.'

89
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:23,040
Very quickly the dog came back. The princess was 
asleep on its back. Her beautiful face was sad.

90
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,840
Hans woke her and took her into the garden.

91
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,880
'Where am I?' she cried. 'What 
is happening?' She was afraid.

92
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,520
'You are walking with me in my garden,' 
said Hans. 'Look - the flowers are asleep.'

93
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:52,720
'A garden!' cried the princess. 'Am I 
outside? With the ground under my feet  

94
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:02,160
and the sky over my head? No walls? No windows? 
I can hear the sounds of the night round me!'

95
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:15,040
They walked for a long time. Then the sun started 
to appear. 'I have to go,' she said. 'But how did  

96
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:24,480
I get here?' Hans told her about the glass box 
and the dogs. She hit the box and called the dog.

97
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,720
'Good dog!' she said, when it appeared. 
'You have beautiful eyes. Take me home.  

98
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,560
I don't want anybody to see us. 
Thank you for this night, Hans.'  

99
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,600
The princess climbed on the 
dog's back and fell asleep.

100
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,880
The next day the princess 
did not remember anything  

101
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,880
but she felt different. Her servant, Anna, 
a jealous and unkind woman, woke her.  

102
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:05,840
She said, 'Wake up, princess, it is the middle 
of the day. The king is waiting for you.'

103
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:15,520
'Is he?' said the princess and she jumped happily 
out of bed. 'Look, Anna, it's a beautiful day.'

104
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,280
Anna started to think. A 
number of things were strange.  

105
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:29,840
First, the princess always got up at seven 
o'clock, but today it was twelve o'clock.  

106
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,200
Second, the princess was always 
sad, but today, she was happy.  

107
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:47,840
Third, the bottom of the princess's nightdress was 
dirty. Fourth, there was a beautiful white flower  

108
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,080
on the princess's bedroom floor, but there 
were no white flowers in the king's garden.

109
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,840
Anna went to the king.

110
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:06,480
'Let's wait and watch,' said the king. 
'When she goes out again, well follow her.'

111
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,080
Hans was in love with the princess. He 
thought about her all day and all night.  

112
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,080
After three days, he couldn't wait.  

113
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:26,800
He hit the glass box - one, two - and the 
dog with eyes as large as oranges appeared.

114
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
'Please bring the princess to my garden,' he said.

115
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:43,120
The dog went to the princess. But Anna was 
there, too. The dog carried the princess away  

116
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,480
on its back and Anna followed. The dog stopped 
at the door of a big house and went in.  

117
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,840
Anna wrote the letter 'X' 
on the door and went home.

118
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:06,320
Hans and the princess walked in the garden. Hans 
told the story of the old woman and the tree  

119
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:14,000
and the three dogs and the glass box. He told 
the princess about his poor mother and about  

120
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
his three brothers and three sisters. The princess 
loved his stories. She talked about her parents.

121
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:31,280
'My father was a great man and a good 
king,' she said. 'But when my mother died,  

122
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:41,200
he changed. Suddenly he was old and tired 
and sad. He shut me in that house. Now he  

123
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,960
gets angry about little things. He doesn't want 
to be king. He wants white flowers in his garden.  

124
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,800
My mother loved white flowers. 
But now his flowers always die.'

125
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,560
The red of the morning sun started to light up 
the sky. The princess said goodnight to Hans.  

126
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:15,040
He hit the box - one, two - and the second 
dog appeared. With its eyes as big as oranges,  

127
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,960
this dog could see everything. It saw 
the 'X' on the door and it told Hans.

128
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,280
'Ho ho!' laughed Hans. 'Come with 
me quickly and we will write "X"s  

129
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,840
on every door in this street, 
and the next ten streets!'

130
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,000
The next day, Anna told the 
king the story of the night.  

131
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,040
The king took Anna and some men to Hans's street.

132
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,440
'Here is the house,' cried Anna.

133
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,240
'No, here it is,' cried the king.

134
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:06,960
One of the men ran to them. 'The house is in 
the next street,' he said. 'There is an "X"  

135
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:17,840
on the door.' Every house had an 'X' on its 
door. The king was very angry and went home.

136
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:27,520
Later that day, Anna thought of another plan. 
She went into her room and shut the door. She  

137
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:35,360
made a small bag and she put little white stones 
in the bag. She made a small cut in the bottom  

138
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:44,720
of the bag and then put it in the princess's 
clothes. 'Now,' she said, 'when the princess  

139
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:52,240
goes out, the little stones will fall onto the 
road. We can follow the stones to the house.'

140
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,280
That night Hans called the princess again 
with the glass box. They walked in the garden.  

141
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,120
The dog with eyes as large as plates 
waited at the front of the house.

142
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,920
'I would like to be a prince,' said Hans.

143
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,600
'I would like not to be a 
princess,' said the princess.

144
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:29,360
'Why?' asked Hans. She didn't answer. 'I want 
to be a prince,' he said, 'because I want to  

145
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:38,160
marry you.' They sat down under a tree. Hans 
put the glass box on the ground next to him.

146
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,240
'Don't be a prince,' she 
said. 'I can't love a prince.  

147
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,480
I will be a poor girl and you will be Hans.'

148
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,840
At that minute the dog saw the king 
and Anna with a hundred servants.  

149
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,280
They came out of the king's house and 
looked at the little white stones.  

150
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,840
The white stones shone in the dark and they 
followed them. The dog ran to the princess.

151
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,520
'The king! The king is coming!' 
it cried. 'Come quickly!'  

152
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:23,840
The dog ran away through the streets 
with the princess on its back.

153
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:34,000
The king, Anna and the servants arrived at Hans's 
house. 'Is the princess here?' cried the king.  

154
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,680
Hans didn't answer. Suddenly the 
king saw his daughter's little shoe  

155
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,520
on the ground next to some beautiful white 
flowers. He couldn't speak for a minute.  

156
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:59,200
Then he said angrily to Hans, 'My wood-cutter will 
cut off your head at twelve o'clock tomorrow.'  

157
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,840
The servants took Hans to the 
king's house and shut him in a room.

158
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:14,640
Hans looked for his glass box. Where was 
it? Lost! He could not call the dogs.  

159
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,840
Then he remembered. It was under the tree.

160
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:28,080
When the sun came up, Hans went to the 
window and looked out. He was very high up.  

161
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,840
He saw a little boy below him and called to him.

162
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,480
'Hey! Little boy!'

163
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,400
'What do you want?' cried the boy.

164
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,440
'Would you like three pence?'

165
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,240
'Yes, please,' said the boy.

166
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,720
'Then run to my house. Say to my 
servant, "Hans has a little glass  

167
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,840
box. It is in the garden under a tree. He 
wants me to bring it to the king's house."  

168
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,960
When you bring me the box, I 
will give you three pence.'

169
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:16,160
The boy disappeared. A little time 
later he came back with the box.

170
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:23,040
'Throw it up to me,' called Hans. The 
boy threw up the box and Hans caught it.  

171
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,320
Then he threw down the money.

172
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:35,520
At that minute, the door opened and the 
king's men came in. They took Hans to a big  

173
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,480
square in the centre of the town. Everybody 
from the town was there. They wanted to watch.  

174
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,360
The king stood in the middle of the square with 
the important people of the town round him.  

175
00:21:50,560 --> 00:22:00,640
In front of Hans stood a big strong wood-cutter. 
He wore a long red coat and a tall black hat.

176
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,240
'Are you ready?' said the king to the wood-cutter.

177
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,840
'Are you ready?' said the wood-cutter to Hans.

178
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,640
'No!' cried Hans, and he took out the glass box.

179
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,520
'Are you ready?' said the wood-cutter to Hans.

180
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,760
'No!' cried Hans, and he hit the box 
once. He hit the box again - one,  

181
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,480
two - and then again - one, two, three. 
The three dogs stood in front of him.

182
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,040
'Take the wood-cutter away,' he said 
to the dog with eyes as large as eggs.  

183
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,640
'Throw him in the river.' The dog ran 
away with the wood-cutter on his back.

184
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:57,760
'Take the king's men away,' Hans said to the 
dog with eyes as large as plates. The dog  

185
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:05,680
got bigger and bigger. Everybody watched with 
open mouths. Now the dog was as big as a house.  

186
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,600
The king's men were very afraid and ran away.

187
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:18,480
'Bring the princess here,' Hans said to the dog 
with eyes as big as oranges. Where is the king?'  

188
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,760
he cried.

189
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:28,240
In a short time the princess and the king stood 
in front of Hans with the dogs behind them.

190
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,000
'Do you want to be king?' Hans asked the old king.

191
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:44,080
'No,' said the king. 'I only want to have white 
flowers in my garden, and a happy daughter.'

192
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,600
'When the princess and I marry, white 
flowers will live in your garden again  

193
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
and the princess will be happy.'

194
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:04,320
And so Hans married the princess. The new 
king and queen lived happily for many years.  

195
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:12,320
They had six children and a very big garden. 
The old king lived his last years near them.  

196
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,840
His garden was a sea of 
white flowers all year.
 
 
 
 

197
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,434
- THE END -
