CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,839
The Time Traveller

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,890
The Time Traveller (it will be convenient
to call him this) was talking to us about

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,630
geometry.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,439
His grey eyes shone and his usually pale face
was red and excited.

6
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,890
The fire burned brightly and there was that
relaxed after-dinner feeling when thoughts

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,600
run freely.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,450
'You must listen carefully.

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:34,590
I shall have to destroy one or two ideas that
almost everyone accepts - for example, the

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,230
geometry that they taught you at school.

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:45,039
You know, of course, that a mathematical line,
a line with no thickness, doesn't really exist.

12
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,380
They taught you that?

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:52,530
A mathematical model, which only has length,
width and thickness, doesn't really exist

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,829
either.

15
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:55,730
It's just an idea.'

16
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,600
'That's all right,' said the Psychologist.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,909
'But if you make that model out of a material,'
said Filby, a red-haired man who liked an

18
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,520
argument, 'it exists.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,220
All things exist.'

20
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,090
'Most people think so.

21
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,450
But wait a moment.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,130
Imagine a thing that doesn't last for any
time.

23
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,310
Can it have a real existence?'

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,000
Filby looked thoughtful.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,810
'Clearly,' the Time Traveller said, 'a real
body must have length, width, thickness (the

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,869
dimensions of space) - and also exist in time.

27
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,390
But through a natural human weakness, we usually
forget the fourth of these.'

28
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,330
'That,' said a very young man, 'is very clear.'

29
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:57,469
'Well, I don't mind telling you that I have
been at work on this geometry of four dimensions

30
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:58,750
for some time.

31
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,530
Some of my results are interesting.

32
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,430
Here is a record of the weather.

33
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,820
This line shows the changes in temperature.

34
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:15,370
Yesterday it was quite high, last night it
fell, then this morning it rose again.

35
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:22,340
Surely that line is not in any of the dimensions
of space that we generally understand?

36
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,250
It is along the time-dimension.'

37
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:33,280
'But,' said the Medical Man, looking hard
at the fire,' if time is really only a fourth

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:41,010
dimension of space, why can't we move about
in it as we move in the other dimensions?'

39
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,450
The Time Traveller smiled.

40
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,540
'Are you so sure we can move freely in space?

41
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,209
We can go right and left, backwards and forwards
freely enough.

42
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:53,950
But up and down?

43
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,069
That isn't so easy.'

44
00:02:55,069 --> 00:03:00,430
'Well, we can move a little up and down,'
said the Medical Man.

45
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,640
'But we can't move at all in time.

46
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,870
We are always in the present moment.'

47
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,510
'That is at the centre of my great discovery.

48
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:18,590
Why can a modern man not hope that one day
he might travel in time?'

49
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,010
'It doesn't make sense,' said Filby.

50
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,120
'Possibly not,' said the Time Traveller.

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,530
'But now you begin to see the reason for my
work on the geometry of four dimensions.

52
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:39,940
Long ago I had an idea for a machine that
can travel in any direction of space and time,

53
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,840
as the driver wants.'

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,390
Filby started to laugh.

55
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,390
'But I have proved this by experiment,' said
the Time Traveller.

56
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:54,030
'It would be very useful for the historian,'
the Psychologist suggested.

57
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,060
'He could travel back and see how things really
happened!'

58
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,650
'Then there is the future,' said the Very
Young Man.

59
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,040
'Just think!

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,510
You could put all your money in the bank,
leave it to grow and hurry on ahead!'

61
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,849
'To discover a society,' I said,' that doesn't
use money.'

62
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,560
'Of all the crazy ideas!'

63
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,259
began the Psychologist.

64
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:21,000
'It seemed so to me, and I never talked about
it until-'

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,669
'An experiment!'

66
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:23,669
I cried.

67
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,030
'You are going to prove that?'

68
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,020
'Let's see what you can do,' said the Psychologist,
'though I think it's all rubbish.'

69
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,509
The Time Traveller smiled at us.

70
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:42,289
Then, with his hands deep inside his trouser
pockets, he walked slowly out of the room

71
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:45,270
and we heard him going down to the laboratory.

72
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,740
The Psychologist looked at us.

73
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,810
'I wonder what he's got?'

74
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,509
'A trick probably,' said the Medical Man,
and Filby tried to tell us about a trick he

75
00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:02,389
had seen once, but before he had really started
his story the Time Traveller came back.

76
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,410
He held something in his hand.

77
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:10,440
It was made of shiny metal and was not much
larger than a small clock.

78
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:18,700
And now I must be exact, because unless you
believe his explanation it is impossible to

79
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,290
explain what happened next.

80
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:28,480
He took one of the small tables in the room
and put it in front of the fire.

81
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,020
On this he placed the machine.

82
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,139
Then he placed a chair next to it and sat
down.

83
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:44,740
The only other object on the table was a small
lamp, the light of which fell on the model.

84
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:51,720
I sat in a low chair nearest the fire and
I pulled this forwards so I was almost between

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,840
the Time Traveller and the fire.

86
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,069
Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder.

87
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:03,960
The Medical Man watched him from the right;
the Psychologist from the left.

88
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,810
The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist.

89
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,060
We were all wide awake.

90
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:17,050
I cannot believe that a trick was played on
us under these conditions.

91
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,919
'This little thing,' said the Time Traveller,
resting his elbows on the table and pressing

92
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,860
his hands together above the machine, 'is
only a model.

93
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,280
It is my plan for a machine to travel through
time.

94
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,870
You will notice that it looks a little rough,
and this bar has an odd shining appearance

95
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,490
- it looks quite unreal.'

96
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,060
He pointed to this part with his finger.

97
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:53,440
'Also, here is one little white lever, and
here is another.'

98
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,199
The Medical Man got out of his chair and looked
closely into the thing.

99
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,840
'It's beautifully made,' he said.

100
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,160
'It took two years to make,' said the Time
Traveller.

101
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:15,120
Then, when we had all had a close look, he
said, 'Now I want you to understand clearly

102
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:23,120
that this lever sends the machine flying into
the future, and this other one sends it into

103
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,490
the past.

104
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:34,080
'Soon, I'm going to press the lever and the
machine will disappear into future time.

105
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,770
Have a good look at the thing.

106
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,069
Look at the table too, and satisfy yourself
that there can be no tricks.

107
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:48,190
I don't want to waste this model and then
be told I'm dishonest.'

108
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,820
There was a minute's pause perhaps.

109
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:56,110
The Psychologist opened his mouth to speak
to me but closed it again.

110
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,509
Then the Time Traveller put out his finger
towards the lever.

111
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:06,000
'No,' he said suddenly, pulling his finger
away again.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,310
'Lend me your hand.'

113
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:14,310
And turning to the Psychologist, he took that
person's hand in his own and told him to put

114
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:20,400
out his first finger and touch the lever.

115
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:28,220
So the Psychologist himself sent the model
time machine on its endless journey.

116
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,949
We all saw the lever turn.

117
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:36,090
I am completely certain there was no trick.

118
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:41,140
There was a breath of wind and the lamp flame
jumped.

119
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:48,589
The machine suddenly turned round, looked
unclear, was seen like a ghost for a second

120
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:54,190
and was gone - disappeared!

121
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,290
Except for the lamp, the table was empty.

122
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,020
Everyone was silent for a minute.

123
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:07,399
Then the Psychologist recovered from his surprise
and looked under the table.

124
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,630
The Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.

125
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,500
'Well?' he said.

126
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,750
We all stared.

127
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:22,200
'My friend,' said the Medical Man quietly,
'are you serious about this?

128
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:29,450
Do you really believe that machine has travelled
in time?'

129
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,940
'Certainly,' said the Time Traveller.

130
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,490
'And I have a big machine nearly finished
in there' - he pointed to the laboratory - 'and

131
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:45,560
when that is put together I intend to go on
a journey myself.'

132
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:52,930
'You mean to say that that machine has travelled
into the future?' said Filby.

133
00:09:52,930 --> 00:10:00,690
'Into the future or the past - I'm not completely
sure which.'

134
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:06,769
After some time the Psychologist said, 'It
has gone into the past if it has gone anywhere.'

135
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:10,170
'Why?' said the Time Traveller.

136
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:17,300
'Because I'm quite sure that it hasn't moved
in space, and if it travelled into the future

137
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,870
it would still be here all this time.

138
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:26,120
It would have to travel through the time that
is passing as we stand here.'

139
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,360
'But,' I said, 'if it travelled into the past,
why wasn't it here when we first came into

140
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,750
this room, and last Thursday when we were
here - and the Thursday before that?'

141
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:46,800
'Let's be fair - these are serious questions,'
said Filby, turning towards the Time Traveller.

142
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,720
'That can be explained,' the Time Traveller
said to the Psychologist.

143
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,790
'It's there but can't be seen.'

144
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,260
'Of course,' said the Psychologist.

145
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,960
'That's simple enough.

146
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Why didn't I think of it?

147
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,220
We can't see it, in the same way that we can't
see a bullet flying through the air.

148
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:16,519
If it is travelling through time fifty times
or a hundred times faster than we are, we

149
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:23,320
can see only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth
of it.'

150
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,700
We sat and stared at the empty table for a
minute or two.

151
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,630
Then the Time Traveller asked us what we thought
of it all.

152
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,519
'It sounds believable enough tonight,' said
the Medical Man, 'but it will seem different

153
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,709
in the morning.'

154
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:44,990
'Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?'
asked the Time Traveller.

155
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:51,290
And then, taking the lamp in his hand, he
led the way to the laboratory.

156
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:58,860
I remember clearly how we all followed him,
and how in the laboratory we saw a larger

157
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,720
copy of the little machine.

158
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:08,480
It was almost complete, but two bars lay unfinished
on the table and I picked one up for a better

159
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,680
look.

160
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,910
'Now listen,' said the Medical Man,' are you
really serious?'

161
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:25,699
'In that machine,' said the Time Traveller,
holding the lamp high, 'I intend to travel

162
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:26,960
in time.

163
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,000
Is that clear?

164
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,460
I was never more serious in my life.'

165
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,889
None of us knew what to say.

166
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:47,170
I looked at Filby over the shoulder of the
Medical Man and he smiled at me.

167
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,610
CHAPTER TWO

168
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,880
The Traveller Returns

169
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,949
I think at that time none of us really believed
in the Time Machine.

170
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:06,240
The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of
those men who are too clever to be believed.

171
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,220
You never felt that you knew everything about
him.

172
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,630
You always thought that something was hidden,
that he was playing a trick on you.

173
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:21,079
If Filby showed us the model and explained
things in the Time Traveller's words, we would

174
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:23,050
believe him more easily.

175
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:29,130
We would understand his reasons - because
anyone could understand Filby.

176
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:37,740
But the Time Traveller had a strong imagination
and we didn't really believe him.

177
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:44,209
The next Thursday I went to Richmond again
and, arriving late, found four or five men

178
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:46,610
already in the sitting room.

179
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,900
The Medical Man was standing in front of the
fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and

180
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,010
his watch in the other.

181
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,130
I looked around for the Time Traveller.

182
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,070
'It's half-past seven now,' said the Medical
Man.

183
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,790
'I suppose we'd better have dinner?'

184
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,259
'Where's our host?'

185
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:06,380
I asked.

186
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,329
'You have just come?

187
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:11,190
It's rather odd.

188
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,680
He has been delayed.

189
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:20,070
He asks me in this note to start dinner at
seven if he's not back.

190
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,380
He says he will explain when he comes.'

191
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:29,459
'It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,'
said the editor of a well-known daily paper,

192
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,910
and so the Medical Man rang the bell.

193
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:38,300
Only the Psychologist, the Medical Man and
myself had attended the first dinner.

194
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:45,499
The other men were the Editor, a journalist
and another - a quiet, shy man with a beard

195
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:48,490
- who I didn't know.

196
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:54,040
There was some discussion at the dinner table
about the Time Traveller's absence and I suggested

197
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,019
time travelling, in a half-joking way.

198
00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:02,810
The Editor wanted that to be explained to
him and the Psychologist gave a very dull

199
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,620
description of the 'clever trick' we had seen
a week before.

200
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:14,620
He was in the middle of this when the door
opened slowly and without noise.

201
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,660
I was facing it and saw him first.

202
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
'Well!'

203
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,670
I said.

204
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,590
'At last!'

205
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:27,230
The door opened wider and the Time Traveller
stood in front of us.

206
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,120
I gave a cry of surprise.

207
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,310
'Oh, my friend!

208
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,320
What's the matter?'

209
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,089
cried the Medical Man, who saw him next.

210
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:39,460
The others turned towards the door.

211
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,270
He looked very strange.

212
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:51,990
His coat was dusty and dirty, his hair untidy
and, it seemed to me, greyer - either with

213
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,860
dust or because its colour had gone.

214
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,940
His face was very pale and his chin had a
cut on it.

215
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:07,620
For a moment he stopped at the door; the light
seemed too strong for his eyes.

216
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,990
Then he came into the room.

217
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,450
He walked slowly, with a bad limp.

218
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:20,830
He did not say a word, but came painfully
to the table and moved a hand towards the

219
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,830
wine.

220
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,550
The Editor filled a glass and pushed it towards
him.

221
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:33,540
He drank it and it seemed to do him good because
he looked round the table and smiled a little.

222
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,509
'What have you been doing?' said the Medical
Man.

223
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:41,339
The Time Traveller did not seem to hear.

224
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:47,279
'Don't let me worry you,' he said in a tired
voice.

225
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,490
'I'm all right.'

226
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,459
He stopped, held out his glass for more, and
drank it down.

227
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:57,430
'That's good,' he said.

228
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:04,400
His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour
came to his face.

229
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,140
Then he spoke again.

230
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,770
'I'm going to wash and dress, and then I'll
come down and explain things'...

231
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,689
Save me some of that meat.

232
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:18,980
I'm hungry.'

233
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,650
The Editor began a question.

234
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,160
'I'll tell you soon,' said the Time Traveller.

235
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,079
'I'm feeling strange!

236
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,710
I'll be all right in a minute.'

237
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:34,730
He put down his glass and walked towards the
door to the stairs.

238
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,080
Standing up in my place, I saw his feet as
he went out.

239
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,090
He had nothing on them except a pair of socks
with holes in them.

240
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,390
They were covered with dried blood.

241
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,370
Then the door closed behind him.

242
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:54,130
For a minute, perhaps, my mind was empty.

243
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:59,700
'Strange Behaviour of a Famous Scientist,'
I heard the Editor say, thinking of his newspaper.

244
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,710
'What's happened to him?' said the Journalist.

245
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,480
'I don't understand.'

246
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,010
I thought of the Time Traveller walking painfully
upstairs.

247
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,350
I don't think anyone else had noticed his
limp.

248
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:17,960
The Medical Man recovered from his surprise
first, and rang the bell for a hot plate.

249
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,880
The Editor picked up his knife and fork and
the Silent Man did the same.

250
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,570
The dinner started again.

251
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,340
Conversation was slow for a minute or two
because we were so surprised.

252
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:36,130
Then the Editor said, 'Does our friend have
another job, or just a strong imagination?'

253
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:42,289
'I feel sure it's this business of the Time
Machine,' I said, and continued the Psychologist's

254
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,530
story of our earlier meeting.

255
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:52,330
The new guests were very surprised and the
Editor said, 'What is this time travelling?

256
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:58,350
A man couldn't cover himself with dust by
doing something impossible, could he?'

257
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:03,740
The Journalist, too, refused to believe it,
and started to make a joke of the whole thing.

258
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:10,330
'Our Special Reporter in the Day after Tomorrow
reports,' he was saying - or shouting - when

259
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,059
the Time Traveller came back.

260
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:19,560
He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes
and nothing except his tired look reminded

261
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,120
me of the change that had shocked me.

262
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,890
'Well,' said the Editor, laughing, 'these
men say you have been travelling into the

263
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,250
middle of next week.'

264
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,149
The Time Traveller sat down without a word.

265
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:40,130
He smiled quietly, in his usual way.

266
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,110
'Where's my meat?' he said.

267
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,470
'How nice it is to stick a fork into meat
again.'

268
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,190
'Story!'

269
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,830
cried the Editor.

270
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,320
'Later,' said the Time Traveller.

271
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,070
'I want something to eat first.

272
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,350
I won't say a word until I get some food into
my stomach.

273
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,350
Thanks.

274
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,860
And the salt.'

275
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,880
'One word,' I said.

276
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,150
'Have you been time travelling?'

277
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:14,799
'Yes,' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth
full.

278
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,960
'I'd give a pound a line for the story in
your own words,' said the Editor.

279
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,650
The Time Traveller pushed his glass towards
the Silent Man, who was staring at his face.

280
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,630
He jumped a little, then poured him some wine.

281
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,020
The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable.

282
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,710
The Journalist tried to relax us by telling
funny stories.

283
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,950
The Medical Man smoked a cigarette and watched
the Time Traveller closely.

284
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:49,360
The Silent Man seemed nervous, and drank a
lot of wine.

285
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:57,260
At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate
away and looked round at us.

286
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,480
'I suppose I must apologise,' he said.

287
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,960
'I was so hungry.

288
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,880
I've had a most interesting time.'

289
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,890
He put out his hand for a cigarette.

290
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,470
'But come into the smoking room.

291
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,669
The story is too long to tell over dirty plates.'

292
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,799
And he led the way.

293
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,780
'You have told these men about the machine?'
he said to me, sitting back in his chair and

294
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,059
naming the three new guests.

295
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:36,250
'But the thing's just a trick,' said the Editor.

296
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,860
'I can't argue tonight.

297
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,559
I don't mind telling the story, but I can't
argue.

298
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:52,799
I will,' he continued, 'tell you the story
of what has happened to me, if you like, but

299
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,960
you mustn't interrupt.

300
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:06,419
Most of it will sound like lies, but it is
true - every word of it.

301
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:15,990
I was in the laboratory earlier, and since
then ... I have lived eight days... days like

302
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,990
no human being ever lived before!

303
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:28,190
I am very tired, but I shan't sleep until
I have told this thing to you.

304
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,450
But no interruptions!

305
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,450
Is it agreed?'

306
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:41,320
We all agreed and the Time Traveller began
his story as I have written it down.

307
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,570
He sat back in his chair at first and spoke
slowly.

308
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,230
Afterwards he got more excited.

309
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:57,650
As I write it down I feel the limits of pen
and ink, and my own limits.

310
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:05,750
You will read, I expect, with enough attention,
but you cannot see the speaker's white, honest

311
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:13,080
face in the bright circle of the little lamp,
or hear his voice.

312
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,260
Most of us listeners were in shadow.

313
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,960
At first each looked at the others.

314
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:30,470
After a time we stopped doing that and looked
only at the Time Traveller's face.

315
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,029
CHAPTER THREE

316
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:34,029
Forwards in Time

317
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:43,440
'I told some of you last Thursday how the
Time Machine works, and showed you the actual

318
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,039
thing itself, incomplete in the laboratory.

319
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:53,330
It is there now, a little damaged by travel,
but not in bad condition.

320
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:59,779
I expected to finish it on Friday, but when
I had put most of it together, I found that

321
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,429
one piece was too short.

322
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:08,740
I had to make this again, and the thing wasn't
complete until this morning.

323
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:17,760
So at ten o'clock today, the first of all
Time Machines began its journey.

324
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,640
'I checked everything, then got into the seat.

325
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:30,230
I felt a little frightened, but interested
in what was going to happen next.

326
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:36,409
I took the starting lever in one hand and
the stopping one in the other.

327
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:42,120
Then I pressed the first and almost immediately
the second.

328
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:53,210
I felt that I was falling but, looking around,
I saw the laboratory exactly as before.

329
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,899
Had anything happened?

330
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:59,790
For a moment I thought that my mind had tricked
me.

331
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:04,669
Then I noticed the clock.

332
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:09,600
A moment before, it had showed a minute or
two past ten.

333
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,510
Now it was nearly half-past three.

334
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:22,309
'I took a breath, held the starting lever
with both hands and pushed it harder.

335
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,159
The laboratory became unclear and went dark.

336
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:34,240
Mrs Watchett, my cook, came in and walked,
without seeing me, towards the garden door.

337
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,460
I suppose it took her a minute or two to cross
the room, but she seemed to move at high speed.

338
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,240
I pressed the lever over to its furthest position.

339
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,770
'The night came, and in another moment came
tomorrow.

340
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:54,000
The laboratory grew faint and unclear.

341
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,730
Tomorrow night became black, then day again,
night again, day again - faster and faster.

342
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:10,790
A low and changing sound filled my ears, and
my mind became confused.

343
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:17,080
'As my speed increased, night followed day
faster and faster.

344
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:23,010
The faint picture of the laboratory seemed
soon to move away from me.

345
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:32,330
I saw the sun jumping quickly across the sky,
once every minute, each minute being a day.

346
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:38,220
I supposed that the laboratory had been destroyed
and I had come into the open air.

347
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,800
The quick changes of darkness and light were
very painful to my eyes.

348
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:51,190
Then, in the short dark times, I saw the moon
turning quickly through her quarters from

349
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,169
new to full.

350
00:26:53,169 --> 00:27:02,790
'Soon, as I continued, still increasing speed,
the change from night to day became one continuous

351
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,809
greyness.

352
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:07,520
The sky turned a wonderful deep blue.

353
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:15,540
The jumping sun became a line of fire, the
moon a fainter line that changed in width.

354
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,140
'The land was difficult to see clearly.

355
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:24,480
I was still on the hillside where this house
now stands.

356
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,710
I saw trees growing and changing.

357
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:36,900
They changed from green to brown and back
to green again, grew tall, died and fell.

358
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:43,250
I saw enormous buildings rise up, then disappear
like dreams.

359
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,909
The speed dials on the machine went round
faster and faster.

360
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:55,019
The line of the sun moved up and down, from
summer to winter, in a minute or less.

361
00:27:55,019 --> 00:28:01,380
Minute by minute white snow spread across
the world and disappeared, and was followed

362
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,700
by the green of spring.

363
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:12,760
'The unpleasant feelings at the beginning
now changed into a kind of crazy excitement.

364
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:19,150
I noticed a strange movement of the machine
from side to side, which I couldn't explain,

365
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,190
but my mind was too confused to pay any attention
to it.

366
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:30,549
So with a kind of madness growing in me, I
threw myself into the future.

367
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:33,169
At first I didn't think of stopping.

368
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:41,870
But then a new feeling grew in my mind - a
sense of fear mixed with the need to know.

369
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:46,950
'What strange changes had happened to people?

370
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:52,140
What wonderful improvements to our simple
way of life might appear when I looked more

371
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,910
closely into that world?

372
00:28:54,910 --> 00:29:02,080
I saw large and wonderful buildings growing
in front of me, bigger than ours.

373
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,190
I saw a stronger green colour move up the
hillside, and stay there without any interruption

374
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,250
by snow.

375
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:16,950
Although I was travelling so quickly, the
world still seemed beautiful, and so my mind

376
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,640
turned to stopping the machine.

377
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:28,649
'My greatest fear was that there would already
be something in the space when I, or the machine,

378
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:30,210
stopped.

379
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:36,090
While I travelled at high speed through time,
this didn't matter much - I seemed to move

380
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:40,870
like a gas through other things.

381
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:47,299
But when I stopped, I would put myself into
whatever lay in my way.

382
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:53,220
Such close contact with the other thing might
cause a great explosion.

383
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,000
I had thought of this possibility again and
again while I was making the machine, but

384
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,669
then I had cheerfully accepted it as one of
the necessary dangers that a man must face.

385
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:09,059
I wasn't as cheerful now, when I couldn't
escape it.

386
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:15,380
'The strangeness of everything, the movement
of the machine and the feeling of continual

387
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:20,330
falling had made me very nervous.

388
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,649
I told myself that I could never stop.

389
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:29,429
Then, becoming suddenly angry, I decided to
stop immediately.

390
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:33,120
Like a fool in a hurry, I pulled over the
lever.

391
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,390
The machine turned over and I was thrown through
the air.

392
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:41,310
'There was the sound of thunder in my ears.

393
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:49,080
For a moment I forgot what was happening,
then I found myself sitting on soft grass

394
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,120
in front of the machine.

395
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,640
Heavy rain was falling.

396
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:03,269
Everything still seemed grey, but soon I noticed
that the confusion in my ears was gone.

397
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:05,919
I looked around me.

398
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,929
I was on a small lawn, surrounded by bushes.

399
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:16,690
Their purple flowers were dropping under the
beating of the heavy rain.

400
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,669
In a moment I was wet to the skin.

401
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:27,149
"A fine welcome," I thought, "to a man who
has travelled so many years to see you."

402
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:31,919
'Soon I stood up and looked around me.

403
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:40,100
Through the heavy rain I could see an enormous
figure cut, perhaps, out of white stone.

404
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,280
But the rest of the world was unclear.

405
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:49,820
'As the rain became lighter, I saw the white
figure more clearly.

406
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,440
It was very large - a tree touched its shoulder.

407
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,010
It was shaped a little like a sphinx with
spread wings, and seemed to be flying.

408
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:07,230
The pedestal seemed to be made of metal, and
had turned green with age.

409
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,820
I stood looking at the figure for some time.

410
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:16,820
When, at last, I took my eyes from it for
a moment, I saw that the rain was stopping

411
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,559
and the sky was growing lighter.

412
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:26,809
'Then I suddenly realised the full danger
of my journey.

413
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:30,890
What might appear when the rain stopped?

414
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,519
What might people be like?

415
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,269
Had they perhaps changed into something inhuman
and very strong?

416
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:45,870
I might seem like an old-world wild animal,
but more frightening because I looked like

417
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:50,909
them - a horrible creature to be speedily
killed.

418
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:57,889
'Already I saw the shapes of enormous buildings,
and a wooded hillside growing clearer through

419
00:32:57,889 --> 00:32:59,909
the dying storm.

420
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:05,149
I turned quickly to the Time Machine and tried
hard to turn it the right way up.

421
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:12,100
As I did so, the grey rain suddenly stopped
and the sun shone through the clouds.

422
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:17,020
My fear grew stronger and I fought hard with
the machine.

423
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,190
It moved under my attack and turned over.

424
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,850
It hit my chin violently.

425
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:28,070
One hand on the seat, the other on the lever,
I stood breathing heavily, ready to climb

426
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,409
inside it again.

427
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:35,799
'But now I had a way of escaping, my confidence
recovered.

428
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:41,809
I looked with more interest and less fear
at this world of the future.

429
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:47,710
In a round opening, high up in the wall of
the nearest building, I saw a group of figures

430
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,570
wearing soft robes.

431
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,500
They had seen me, and their faces were turned
towards me.

432
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,149
'Then I heard voices coming nearer.

433
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:02,840
Through the bushes I saw the heads and shoulders
of running men.

434
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,220
One of these appeared on a path leading straight
to the lawn where I stood.

435
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:15,440
He was quite thin, just over a metre high,
wearing only a long purple shirt tied at the

436
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,149
waist with a leather belt.

437
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:25,190
Noticing that, I realised for the first time
how warm the air was.

438
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,940
'He seemed to be very beautiful, but also
very weak.

439
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,639
At the sight of him, my confidence returned.

440
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:39,750
I took my hands from the machine.

441
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,010
CHAPTER FOUR

442
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,261
The People of the Future

443
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:55,369
'In another moment we were standing face to
face, I and this weak creature from the future.

444
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:59,850
He came straight up to me and laughed into
my eyes.

445
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:04,690
I noticed immediately that he had no fear
in him.

446
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,710
Then he turned to the two others who were
following him.

447
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:12,020
He spoke to them in a strange and very sweet-sounding
language.

448
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:18,050
'There were more coming, and soon a little
group of perhaps eight or ten of these beautiful

449
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,890
people were around me.

450
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,160
One of them spoke to me.

451
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,710
I don't know why, but I thought that my voice
was too strong and deep for them.

452
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:34,310
So I shook my head and, pointing to my ears,
shook it again.

453
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:41,040
He came a step forwards, stopped and then
touched my hand.

454
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,690
Then I felt other soft little hands on my
back and shoulders.

455
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,150
They wanted to make sure that I was real.

456
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,950
'There was nothing at all frightening in this.

457
00:35:51,950 --> 00:36:00,240
In fact, these pretty little people had a
relaxed and childlike gentleness that made

458
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,520
me confident.

459
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,220
And also, they looked so weak that I could
imagine myself throwing the whole group of

460
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,619
them to the ground.

461
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:13,410
'But I made a sudden movement to warn them
when I saw their little pink hands touching

462
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,410
the Time Machine.

463
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:22,470
Fortunately then, when it wasn't too late,
I thought of the danger that I had forgotten.

464
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:28,190
Reaching over the bars of the machine, I took
out the little levers that would make it move.

465
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,730
I put these in my pocket.

466
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:36,849
Then I turned again to the little people to
see how I could communicate.

467
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:43,950
'Looking closer at their faces, I saw some
strange differences in their sweet prettiness.

468
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:50,069
They all had the same wavy hair, and this
came to a sharp end at the neck and below

469
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:52,339
the ears.

470
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:57,160
There was none growing on their faces, and
their ears were very small.

471
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:03,839
Their mouths were small, too, with bright
red, rather thin lips.

472
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:10,849
Their little chins came to a point and their
eyes were large and gentle.

473
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:18,240
Perhaps my sense of my own importance is too
great, but I felt even then that they showed

474
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,180
very little interest in me.

475
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:27,080
'Because they didn't try to speak to me, but
simply stood smiling and speaking softly to

476
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,290
each other, I began the conversation.

477
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,060
I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself.

478
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:41,480
Then, after thinking for a moment how to describe
time, I pointed to the sun.

479
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:47,099
At once a pretty little figure dressed in
purple and white did the same, and then made

480
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,680
the sound of thunder.

481
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:55,119
'For a moment I was very surprised, though
the meaning of his movement was clear enough.

482
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:02,540
The question had come into my mind suddenly:
were these people fools?

483
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,380
You couldn't really understand how I felt.

484
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:13,410
I had always expected that people living about
800,000 years in the future would have much

485
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:18,800
greater knowledge than us in science, art
- everything.

486
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,600
'But one of them had asked me a very simple
question, which showed him to be on the level

487
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,340
of intelligence of one of our five- year-old
children.

488
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:36,550
He had asked me, in fact, if I had come from
the sun in a thunderstorm!

489
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:43,869
'This made me think again about their clothes,
their weak arms and legs and pretty faces.

490
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:49,070
A feeling of sadness came into my mind.

491
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:55,990
For a moment I felt that I had built the Time
Machine for no reason at all.

492
00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:01,750
'I said yes, pointed to the sun, and made
a sound like thunder.

493
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:07,810
This was so real that it frightened them - they
all stood back a step or two and bent their

494
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:10,320
heads down.

495
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,420
Then one came laughing towards me, carrying
some beautiful flowers which were new to me.

496
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,760
He put these around my neck.

497
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,420
'The idea made them all happy.

498
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,850
Soon they were running around for flowers
and throwing them on me until I was almost

499
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,440
covered with them.

500
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,589
You cannot imagine what wonderful flowers
countless years of work had produced.

501
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:43,410
'Then someone suggested that their new toy
should be shown to others in the nearest building,

502
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:49,050
and so I was led past the sphinx made of white
stone, which had seemed to watch me all the

503
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:53,130
time with a smile at my surprise.

504
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:59,010
As I went with them, the memory of my hopes
for a future full of highly intelligent people

505
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,130
came to my mind, and made me smile.

506
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:09,089
'The building had a very large entrance, and
was really enormous.

507
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:14,810
I was worried about the growing crowd of little-
people, and the shadows beyond the big open

508
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,400
doors.

509
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,480
Around me I saw many bushes and flowers.

510
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,450
It was clear that no gardener was looking
after them, but they still looked beautiful.

511
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:30,400
The Time Machine was left on the lawn.

512
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,089
'Several more brightly-dressed people met
me in the doorway and we walked through into

513
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:37,740
a large hall.

514
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:46,140
The roof was in shadow and the windows, partly
made of coloured glass, let in a soft light.

515
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:53,829
The floor was made of large pieces of a very
hard white metal, lower in places where people

516
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:55,941
had clearly walked across it for hundreds
of years.

517
00:40:55,941 --> 00:41:04,460
'Along the length of the room were many tables
made of shiny stone, perhaps half a metre

518
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,869
above the floor, and on these were piles of
fruit.

519
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:15,119
Some I recognised as larger apples and oranges,
but mostly they were strange.

520
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,849
'The people with me sat down around a table
and made signs for me to do the same.

521
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:24,950
They immediately began to eat the fruit with
their hands.

522
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:30,240
I was happy to follow their example because
I felt thirsty and hungry.

523
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,869
As I did so, I took some time to look around
the hall and noticed that the glass windows

524
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:41,710
were broken in many places and the curtains
were thick with dust.

525
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,329
The general effect, though, was very attractive.

526
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:50,700
'There were, perhaps, a couple of hundred
people eating in the hall, and most of them

527
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:57,290
were watching me with interest, their little
eyes shining over the fruit they were eating.

528
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:01,380
All of them were wearing the same soft but
strong material.

529
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:06,530
'Fruit, I later learned, was all that they
ate.

530
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:13,609
These people of the future didn't eat meat,
and while I was with them, although I missed

531
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:16,609
it, I could only eat fruit too.

532
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:26,700
In fact, I discovered later that horses, cows
and sheep, and dogs, had disappeared from

533
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,700
Earth.

534
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,890
But the fruits were very pleasant.

535
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:38,570
'When I had filled my stomach, I tried to
learn some of the language of these new people.

536
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:44,640
The fruits seemed an easy thing to start with,
and holding one of these up, I began using

537
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,800
questioning sounds and movements.

538
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,900
I had great difficulty making them understand.

539
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:58,580
At first they stared in surprise and laughed,
but soon a fair-haired little female seemed

540
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:02,950
to realise what I wanted and repeated a name.

541
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:09,090
'They had to talk for some time to explain
things to each other, and when I first tried

542
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:13,619
to make the sounds of their language they
were very amused.

543
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:19,690
I felt like a teacher among children, but
soon I at least knew a number of names for

544
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:23,210
things and even the verb "to eat".

545
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:29,099
'It was slow work, though, and the little
people soon got tired and wanted to get away

546
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:36,079
from my questions, so I decided to let them
give short lessons when they wanted to.

547
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:43,010
And they were very short lessons because I
have never met people who are lazier or more

548
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,510
easily tired.

549
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:51,819
They used to come to me with happy cries of
surprise, like children, but like children

550
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:56,420
they soon stopped examining me and went away
to find another toy.

551
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:02,980
'When the dinner ended, I noted the disappearance
of almost all the creatures who had surrounded

552
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,350
me at first.

553
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:10,869
It is odd, too, how quickly I stopped caring
about these little people.

554
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:13,410
I was continually meeting more of them.

555
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:19,579
They followed me a little distance, talked
and laughed around me, smiled in a friendly

556
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:26,060
way, then left me alone.

557
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,609
CHAPTER FIVE

558
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:32,040
Life in the Future

559
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,470
The evening was calm as I came out of the
great hall, and the land was lit by the colour

560
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,190
of the sun as it went down.

561
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:45,960
The big building was on the side of a wide
river valley, but the Thames had moved a kilometre

562
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,810
or two from its present position.

563
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:54,450
I decided to climb to the top of a hill from
where I could see more of our world in the

564
00:44:54,450 --> 00:45:04,920
year 802,701.That was the date the little
dials of my machine had showed.

565
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:11,599
'As I walked, I looked for anything that could
explain the bad condition of things.

566
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:18,090
A little way up the hill, for example, was
a great pile of stones held together by pieces

567
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,310
of metal.

568
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:24,690
These were the ruins of a great building,
although I couldn't imagine what its use had

569
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,700
been.

570
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:33,770
'Looking round with a sudden thought, I realised
that there were no small houses.

571
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:39,880
Here and there among the trees and bushes
were palace-like buildings, but the single

572
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,110
house, and possibly even the family, had disappeared.

573
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:49,360
'And then came another thought.

574
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,160
I looked at the small group of figures who
were following me.

575
00:45:53,160 --> 00:46:00,660
I saw that all had the same type of clothes,
the same soft hairless faces and the same

576
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,020
girlish arms and legs.

577
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,800
'It may seem odd, perhaps, that I hadn't noticed
this before.

578
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,760
But everything was so strange.

579
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,730
Now, I saw the fact clearly enough.

580
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:24,240
These people of the future were all very similar
in clothes, and in all other ways the differences

581
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,520
between men and women had almost disappeared.

582
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,660
And the children seemed to my eyes to be just
smaller adults.

583
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:42,619
'Seeing how safely and comfortably these people
lived, I felt that this close similarity of

584
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:45,510
the sexes was understandable.

585
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:51,440
If there are enough people, it becomes a problem
rather than an advantage to have a lot of

586
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,319
children.

587
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:59,710
If violence conies only rarely and children
are safe, there is less need for men to be

588
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:02,890
strong and protect their families.

589
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:09,869
This, I must remind you, was my feeling at
the time.

590
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:14,339
Later, I discovered how wrong I was.

591
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:20,930
'I continued, and because I could walk better
than the people of the future, I found myself

592
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,170
alone for the first time.

593
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:30,980
At the top of the hill I found a seat of a
yellow metal that I didn't recognise.

594
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:36,590
I sat down on it and looked at the wide view
of our world under the sunset of that long

595
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,730
day.

596
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,309
It was as beautiful as I have ever seen.

597
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:48,190
The west was burning gold, mixed with some
purple and red.

598
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:56,190
Below was the valley of the Thames, in which
the river lay like a line of shining metal.

599
00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:02,319
'As I watched, I began to try to understand
the things I had seen.

600
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,210
(Afterwards I realised I had only learned
half the truth.)

601
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:11,950
It seemed to me that people were now past
their best.

602
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:18,360
The sunset made me think about the sunset
of our people.

603
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,869
For the first time I began to understand an
odd result of the social changes we are trying

604
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:27,760
to make at the moment.

605
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:36,089
Strength comes because we need to be strong;
weakness comes when we feel safe.

606
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:43,540
The work of improving the conditions of life,
of making life safer and safer, had continued

607
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:46,970
until nothing more could be done.

608
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:50,579
The result was what I saw!

609
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:59,340
'The science of our time has attacked only
a few human diseases, but it moves forwards.

610
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,680
Farming today is still at an early stage.

611
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:09,760
We improve our plants and animals very slowly
- a new and better apple, a prettier and larger

612
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,670
flower, a cow that gives more milk.

613
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:18,400
One day the whole world will be better organised,
and better.

614
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:25,540
'I knew that this change had been made, and
made well, in the space of time across which

615
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,309
my machine had jumped.

616
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:36,500
The air was free of unpleasant insects, the
earth was free of useless plants.

617
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,920
Everywhere there were fruits and sweet and
pleasant flowers.

618
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,180
Beautiful birds flew here and there.

619
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,819
And I saw no diseases during my stay.

620
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:51,250
'Social changes, too, had been made.

621
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:57,200
I saw people living in fine buildings, beautifully
dressed, but I hadn't yet found them doing

622
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,250
any work.

623
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,579
There were no signs of economic activity.

624
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:09,200
The shop, the advertisement, buying and selling
- all of these things are so important to

625
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,700
us, and all of them were gone.

626
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:19,549
It was natural in the evening that I had the
idea of a social heaven.

627
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:25,190
'But this change in conditions has to produce
changes in people.

628
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:30,849
What is the cause of human intelligence and
energy?

629
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:36,180
Difficulties make people strong and clever
and help them to work together.

630
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:42,930
And the family, with its protective love and
selfishness, is there for the care of children.

631
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:47,220
The love of parents helps to keep the young
out of danger.

632
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,760
Now, where were these dangers?

633
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:57,490
'I thought of the physical smallness of the
people, their low intelligence and those big

634
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:00,110
ruined buildings.

635
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:06,200
It strengthened my belief that humans, who
had always fought against nature, had finally

636
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,740
won - because after the fight comes quietness.

637
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:20,589
People had been strong, energetic and intelligent,
and had used this energy to change their living

638
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:22,290
conditions.

639
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:28,930
And now they too had changed because of the
new conditions.

640
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:36,160
'No doubt the beauty of the buildings was
the result of the last waves of the now purposeless

641
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,340
energy of people.

642
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:42,980
After that, they began to lead quieter lives.

643
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:49,990
Even artistic activity would finally disappear
- had almost disappeared in the time I saw.

644
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:57,150
The people liked to cover themselves in flowers,
to dance and to sing in the sunlight.

645
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,589
That was all they did.

646
00:51:59,589 --> 00:52:05,770
'As I stood there in the growing dark, I thought
that I had understood the whole secret of

647
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:08,400
these pleasant people.

648
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:14,359
Possibly their population control had worked
too well, and their numbers had fallen instead

649
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:16,809
of staying the same.

650
00:52:16,809 --> 00:52:19,740
That would explain the empty ruins.

651
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:30,460
My explanation was very simple, and believable
enough - as most wrong ideas are!

652
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:33,059
CHAPTER SIX

653
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:34,059
Lost in Time

654
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:43,829
'As I stood there thinking about this too
perfect success of humans, the full moon came

655
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:46,290
up in the north-east.

656
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:52,750
The little figures stopped moving around below
me and the night began to feel cold.

657
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:56,810
I decided to go down and find a place to sleep.

658
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:59,750
'I looked for the building I knew.

659
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:05,099
Then my eye moved to the white sphinx on the
pedestal.

660
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:10,349
There were the bushes and there was the little
lawn.

661
00:53:10,349 --> 00:53:12,980
I looked at it again.

662
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:16,370
A strange doubt made me feel cold.

663
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:22,359
"No," I said to myself, "that isn't the lawn."

664
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:29,040
'But it was the lawn, because the white face
of the sphinx was towards it.

665
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,980
Can you imagine how I felt as I realised this?

666
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,109
But you can't.

667
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:37,450
The Time Machine had gone!

668
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:44,930
'At once I understood the possibility of losing
my own time, of being left helpless in this

669
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,579
strange new world.

670
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:51,720
I ran with great jumps down the hillside.

671
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,890
Once I fell and cut my face.

672
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:59,589
I did nothing to stop the blood, but jumped
up and continued running.

673
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:03,900
All the time I was saying to myself, "They
have just pushed it under the bushes out of

674
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,109
the way."

675
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:08,650
'But I knew that I was wrong.

676
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:13,930
I suppose I covered the whole distance to
the small lawn, three kilometres perhaps,

677
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:15,930
in ten minutes.

678
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:19,170
I shouted but nobody answered.

679
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:23,130
Nobody seemed to be moving in that moonlit
world.

680
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:28,990
'When I reached the lawn, I found that my
worst fears were true.

681
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:34,710
The Time Machine was nowhere to be seen.

682
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,869
I felt faint and cold.

683
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:45,299
I ran round the lawn quickly, checking every
corner, then stopped suddenly.

684
00:54:45,299 --> 00:54:48,579
Above me was the white sphinx.

685
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:51,630
It seemed to smile with pleasure at my problems.

686
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:57,690
'It is possible that the little people had
put the machine in a safe place for me, but

687
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:03,510
I didn't feel that they were either strong
enough or caring enough to move it.

688
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:10,690
This is what worried me, the feeling of a
new power that had moved the machine.

689
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,160
But where could it be?

690
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,640
'I think I went a little mad.

691
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:23,420
I remember running violently in and out of
the moonlit bushes all around the sphinx and

692
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,369
frightening a small white animal that I didn't
recognise.

693
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:34,180
Then, crying and shouting, I went down to
the great building of stone.

694
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:39,170
The big hall was dark, silent and empty.

695
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:43,490
I lit a match and continued past the dusty
curtains.

696
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:51,010
'There I found a second great hall, where
about twenty of the little people were sleeping.

697
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:56,990
I have no doubt they found my second appearance
strange, as I came suddenly out of the quiet

698
00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:02,750
darkness with mad noises and the sudden light
of a match.

699
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,180
Perhaps they had forgotten about matches.

700
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,640
"Where is my Time Machine?"

701
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,270
I began, shaking them with my hands.

702
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:14,510
'This behaviour was very strange to them.

703
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:18,970
Some laughed, but most looked very frightened.

704
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:25,660
When I saw them standing round me, I realised
that it was foolish to try and frighten them.

705
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:30,190
Judging by their daylight behaviour, I thought
that fear must be forgotten.

706
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:36,410
'I threw down the match and, knocking one
of the people over as I went, I ran across

707
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:40,839
the big dining-hall again, out under the moonlight.

708
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:46,219
I heard cries of terror and their little feet
running this way and that.

709
00:56:46,219 --> 00:56:53,559
I don't remember everything I did as the moon
moved slowly up the sky I know that I ran

710
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:59,799
here and there screaming, then lay on the
ground near the sphinx and cried.

711
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:06,690
After that I slept, and when I woke up again
it was light.

712
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:14,329
'I sat up in the freshness of the morning,
trying to remember how I had got there.

713
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:17,530
Then things became clear in my mind.

714
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:24,410
I understood the wild stupidity of my madness
overnight and I could reason with myself.

715
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:27,150
"Suppose the worst," I said.

716
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:31,890
"Suppose the machine is really lost - perhaps
destroyed?

717
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:38,690
I should be calm and patient, learn the ways
of the people, learn what has happened and

718
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:47,210
how to get materials and tools - then, in
the end, perhaps, I can make another machine."

719
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:52,299
That would be my only hope, perhaps, but better
than giving up.

720
00:57:52,299 --> 00:57:56,569
And it was a beautiful and interesting world.

721
00:57:56,569 --> 00:58:00,660
'But probably the machine had only been taken
away.

722
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:07,789
I must be calm, find its hiding-place and
get it back by force and cleverness.

723
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:12,549
I stood up and looked around me, wondering
where I could wash.

724
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:21,640
I felt tired and dirty and rather surprised
by my emotional state the night before.

725
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:27,700
'I made a careful examination of the ground
around the little lawn.

726
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:34,359
I wasted some time in useless questions, asked,
as well as I could, to the little people that

727
00:58:34,359 --> 00:58:35,359
passed.

728
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:38,670
They all failed to understand what I meant.

729
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:43,579
Some simply said nothing; others thought it
was a joke and laughed at me.

730
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:47,140
'The grass told me more.

731
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,599
I found a line in it.

732
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:54,980
There were other signs around, with strange
narrow footprints.

733
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,070
This made me look again at the pedestal.

734
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:01,790
It was made, as I think I have said, of metal.

735
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:05,880
It was highly decorated with metal panels
on either side.

736
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,750
'I went and knocked at these.

737
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:13,120
The pedestal was hollow.

738
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,740
There was no way to pull to open the panels,
but perhaps if they were doors they opened

739
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,920
from inside.

740
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,041
One thing was clear enough to my mind: it
wasn't difficult to work out that the Time

741
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:29,589
Machine was inside that pedestal.

742
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:33,380
But how had it got there?

743
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:40,339
'I saw the heads of two people dressed in
orange coming through the bushes towards me.

744
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:46,480
They came and, pointing to the pedestal, I
tried to make them understand my wish to open

745
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,660
it.

746
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:52,880
But at my first move to do this they behaved
very oddly.

747
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,250
I don't know how to describe their faces to
you.

748
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,099
They looked insulted.

749
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:05,460
'I tried a sweet-looking man in white next,
with exactly the same result.

750
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:09,119
He made me feel ashamed of myself.

751
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:14,989
But as you know, I wanted the Time Machine
and I tried him again.

752
01:00:14,989 --> 01:00:18,970
As he turned away, like the others, I lost
my temper.

753
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:23,900
In three steps I was after him, took him by
the loose part of his robe round the neck

754
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,880
and began pulling him towards the pedestal.

755
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,680
Then I saw the fear on his face and I let
him go.

756
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,619
'But I wasn't beaten yet.

757
01:00:35,619 --> 01:00:39,240
I hit the metal panels with my hands.

758
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:45,309
I thought I heard something move inside - to
be exact, I thought I heard a sound like a

759
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:49,200
laugh - but perhaps I was mistaken.

760
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:54,940
Then I got a big stone from the river and
hit the metal until I had flattened part of

761
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,180
the decoration.

762
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:03,890
The little people could hear the noise a kilometre
way in all directions, but they did nothing.

763
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:10,240
'I saw a crowd of them on the hillside, looking
at me in a frightened way.

764
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,799
At last, hot and tired, I sat down to watch
the place.

765
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,920
But I was too impatient to watch for long.

766
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:25,341
I could work at a problem for years, but I
was unable to wait, inactive, for twenty-

767
01:01:25,341 --> 01:01:26,619
four hours.

768
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:34,000
'I got up after a time and began walking aimlessly
through the bushes towards the hill again.

769
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,619
"Patience," I said to myself.

770
01:01:36,619 --> 01:01:42,599
"If you want your machine again, you must
leave that pedestal alone.

771
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:48,640
If they intend to take your machine away,
it won't help if you destroy their metal panels.

772
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:53,329
If they don't, you will get it back when you
can ask for it.

773
01:01:53,329 --> 01:01:56,589
"Face this world.

774
01:01:56,589 --> 01:02:03,850
Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of guessing
its meaning too quickly.

775
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:08,530
In the end you will find an answer to it all."

776
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:14,750
Then suddenly the humour of the situation
came into my mind: the thought of the years

777
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:21,170
I had spent in study and work to get into
the future age, and now my impatience to get

778
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,359
out of it.

779
01:02:22,359 --> 01:02:30,329
I had put myself into the most hopeless situation
a man could ever imagine.

780
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:36,570
I couldn't help laughing at myself.

781
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:37,570
CHAPTER SEVEN

782
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:42,180
Ghosts

783
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:47,260
'Going through the big palace, it seemed to
me that the little people were staying away

784
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,299
from me.

785
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:54,930
Perhaps it was my imagination, or because
I had hit the metal panels.

786
01:02:54,930 --> 01:03:01,630
I was careful, though, to show no worry and
not try to catch any of them, and after a

787
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:05,680
day or two the situation got back to normal.

788
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:12,420
'I decided to put any thought of my Time Machine
and the mystery of the metal doors as much

789
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:15,640
as possible in a corner of my memory.

790
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:22,339
I hoped that in the end, growing knowledge
would lead me back to them in a natural way.

791
01:03:22,339 --> 01:03:28,470
But you can understand why I stayed within
a circle of a few kilometres around my point

792
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:30,180
of arrival.

793
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:36,890
'As far as I could see, all the world seemed
to be like the Thames valley.

794
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:43,770
From every hill I saw the same large numbers
of fine buildings, all very different in material

795
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:49,720
and style, and the same kinds of trees and
bushes.

796
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:55,150
I soon noticed, though, a number of wells
in the ground.

797
01:03:55,150 --> 01:03:59,789
Several of these, it seemed to me, were very
deep.

798
01:03:59,789 --> 01:04:05,849
One lay by a path up the hill, which I had
followed during my first walk.

799
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:12,700
Like the others, it had a top made of metal,
interestingly decorated and protected by a

800
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,430
little roof from the rain.

801
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:22,770
'Sitting by the side of these wells, and looking
down into the darkness, I could see no sign

802
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:27,549
of water or any reflection when I lit a match.

803
01:04:27,549 --> 01:04:36,839
But in all of them I heard a certain sound
like the beating of a big engine.

804
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:43,799
I also discovered, from the flames of my matches,
that air was going down into them.

805
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:51,339
I threw a piece of paper down into one and,
instead of falling slowly, it was at once

806
01:04:51,339 --> 01:04:54,540
pulled quickly out of sight.

807
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,589
I couldn't imagine what these wells were for.

808
01:04:57,589 --> 01:05:05,210
'And I must say now that I learned very little
about many parts of the life of these people.

809
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:09,520
Let me describe my difficulties.

810
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:17,049
I went into several big palaces, but they
were just living places, great dining-halls

811
01:05:17,049 --> 01:05:19,650
and sleeping apartments.

812
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:25,980
I could find no machines of any kind, but
these people were dressed in fine cloth that

813
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:33,550
didn't seem very old, and their shoes, though
undecorated, were very well made.

814
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:37,799
'But the people didn't seem to make things
themselves.

815
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:44,790
There were no shops, no factories, no signs
that they brought things in from other places.

816
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:51,940
They spent all their time playing gently,
swimming in the river, falling in love in

817
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:57,119
a half-playful way, eating fruit and sleeping.

818
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:01,089
I couldn't see how or where things were produced.

819
01:06:01,089 --> 01:06:06,210
'But something had taken the Time Machine
into the pedestal.

820
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:07,839
Why?

821
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,620
I couldn't imagine.

822
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:17,339
Suppose you found something written in English,
with here and there some words that were completely

823
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:19,270
unknown to you.

824
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:28,420
Well, on the third day of my visit, that was
how I felt about the world of 802,701.

825
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:35,880
'That day I made a friend - a kind of friend.

826
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:40,330
As I was watching some of the little people
playing in a shallow part of the river, one

827
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,109
of them was suddenly pulled away by the water.

828
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:48,569
The river there could run quite quickly, but
not too quickly for a swimmer of normal ability.

829
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:55,630
It will give you an idea, therefore, of the
weakness of these people, when I tell you

830
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:59,690
that none tried to help the one that was in
such danger.

831
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:04,790
'When I realised this, I quickly took off
my clothes and, walking into the water at

832
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:10,060
a place lower down, I caught her and brought
her safely to land.

833
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:16,900
'She soon began to feel better and I saw that
she was all right before I left her.

834
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:21,609
I had such a low opinion of her people by
then that I didn't expect any thanks from

835
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:23,289
her.

836
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:26,020
I was wrong about that, though.

837
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:28,630
'This happened in the morning.

838
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:33,900
In the afternoon I met my little woman as
I was returning from a long walk, and she

839
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:37,990
greeted me with cries of happiness and gave
me some flowers.

840
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:44,770
Perhaps because I had been very lonely I did
my best to show I was happy with the gift.

841
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:51,210
We were soon sitting together and deep in
a conversation, mainly of smiles.

842
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:57,090
'The woman's friendliness affected me exactly
as a child's would.

843
01:07:57,090 --> 01:08:01,119
We passed each other flowers and she kissed
my hands.

844
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,340
I did the same to hers.

845
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:10,059
Then I tried to talk, and found that her name
was Weena.

846
01:08:10,059 --> 01:08:16,469
That was the beginning of a strange friendship,
which continued for a week and ended ... as

847
01:08:16,469 --> 01:08:18,200
I will tell you!

848
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,949
'She was exactly like a child.

849
01:08:21,949 --> 01:08:25,810
She wanted to be with me always.

850
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:32,429
She wanted to follow me everywhere, and on
my next journey around the area I walked fast

851
01:08:32,429 --> 01:08:35,120
and tried to leave her behind.

852
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,219
She gave up at last, calling after me rather
sadly.

853
01:08:39,219 --> 01:08:45,680
But the problems of the world had to be solved
and I hadn't, I said to myself, come into

854
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,850
the future to start a relationship.

855
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:54,520
'She was, though, a very great comfort.

856
01:08:54,520 --> 01:09:00,670
When it was too late, only when it was too
late, I clearly understood how badly she felt

857
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:05,130
when I left her, and what she meant to me.

858
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:12,370
By seeming fond of me, and by showing in her
weak way that she cared for me, the little

859
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:18,310
person soon gave my returns to the place of
the white sphinx almost the feeling of coming

860
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:19,310
home.

861
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:23,080
I used to watch for her when I came over the
hill.

862
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:30,859
'From her, too, I learned that fear had not
yet left the world.

863
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:37,140
She was fearless enough in the daylight, but
she hated the dark shadows.

864
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:41,560
Darkness to her was the one thing to be frightened
of.

865
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:49,509
It was a very strong emotion, and I started
thinking and watching.

866
01:09:49,509 --> 01:09:56,630
'I discovered then, among other things, that
these people got together in the great houses

867
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:59,670
after dark and slept in groups.

868
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:03,840
I never found one outside, alone.

869
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,490
And if I entered the room without a light,
I made them very afraid.

870
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:16,929
But I was such a fool that I missed the lesson
of that fear, and although it made Weena unhappy

871
01:10:16,929 --> 01:10:19,340
I slept away from the others.

872
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:25,140
'It worried her greatly, but in the end her
feelings for me won.

873
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:30,890
For five of the nights of our friendship,
including the last night of all, she slept

874
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:33,750
with her head on my arm.

875
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:37,969
But my story is running away from me as I
speak of her.

876
01:10:37,969 --> 01:10:43,740
'On the night before I met her I was woken
very early in the morning.

877
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:51,640
I had slept badly, dreaming that I was under
water, and that fish were touching my face.

878
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:57,920
I woke suddenly and with the odd feeling that
a greyish animal had just rushed out of the

879
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,239
room.

880
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:05,060
'I tried to go to sleep again, but I felt
uncomfortable.

881
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:10,910
It was that grey hour when things are just
appearing from the darkness, but are still

882
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:12,900
unreal.

883
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:20,370
I got up, went down into the great hall and
out onto the stones in front of the palace.

884
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:23,530
I thought I would go and watch the sun come
up.

885
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:30,401
'The moon was going down, and the dying moonlight
and the first light of day were mixed in a

886
01:11:30,401 --> 01:11:32,969
pale half-light.

887
01:11:32,969 --> 01:11:40,530
The bushes were inky black, the ground a dark
grey, and up on the hillside I thought I could

888
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:45,120
see ghosts.

889
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:53,199
Three times I saw white figures and twice
I thought I saw a single white animal running

890
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:56,580
quickly on two legs.

891
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:01,040
'Near the ruins I saw a group of them carrying
a dark body.

892
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:06,760
They moved quickly and it seemed that they
disappeared among the bushes.

893
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:10,440
The light was still unclear, you must understand.

894
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:19,340
I was experiencing that cold, uncertain, early-morning
feeling you may know, and I doubted my eyes.

895
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:25,600
'As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the
light of day brought stronger colours to the

896
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,739
world again, I watched the hillside closely.

897
01:12:30,739 --> 01:12:34,120
But I saw no more white figures.

898
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:41,560
I thought about them all morning - or at least
until I had to get Weena out of the river.

899
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:47,850
I connected them in some way with the white
animal I had touched in my first mad search

900
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:50,929
for the Time Machine.

901
01:12:50,929 --> 01:12:57,330
It was more pleasant to think about Weena,
but these ghosts would soon take much stronger

902
01:12:57,330 --> 01:13:00,630
control of my mind.

903
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:05,270
CHAPTER EIGHT

904
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:06,270
Morlocks

905
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:14,270
'I think I said how much hotter the weather
of this Golden Age was than our own.

906
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:16,330
I can't explain this.

907
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:21,540
It is usual to think that the sun will continue
cooling in the future.

908
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:28,030
But people forget that the Earth must also,
in the end, fall back closer and closer to

909
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:29,670
the sun.

910
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:36,040
'Well, one very hot morning - my fourth, I
think - as I was trying to get away from the

911
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:45,200
heat and the strong light in a large ruin
near the great house, a strange thing happened.

912
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:52,489
Climbing among those piles of stones, I found
a narrow room, whose end and side windows

913
01:13:52,489 --> 01:13:55,989
were closed by falling stones.

914
01:13:55,989 --> 01:14:00,600
After the light outside, it seemed very dark
to me.

915
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:05,510
I entered it, feeling my way with my hands.

916
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:10,760
'Suddenly, I stopped and held my breath.

917
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:19,280
A pair of eyes, made bright by the reflection
of the daylight outside, was watching me out

918
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,060
of the darkness.

919
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:29,350
'I felt the old natural fear of wild animals
as I looked into those angry eyes.

920
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:31,590
I was afraid to turn.

921
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:36,410
Then I thought how safely people appeared
to be living.

922
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:40,030
And then I remembered their strange terror
of the dark.

923
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:47,480
'Trying to control my fear, I took a step
forwards and spoke.

924
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,760
My voice was strong but shaking.

925
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:56,080
I put out my hand and touched something soft.

926
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:01,650
'At once the eyes moved to the side and something
white ran past me.

927
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:09,420
I turned, as my heart beat even faster, and
saw an odd- looking figure, its head held

928
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:15,350
down in a strange way, running across the
sunlit space behind me.

929
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:22,460
It ran into a large stone, fell to one side
and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow

930
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:25,660
under another pile of stones.

931
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:32,780
'It went too fast for me to see clearly, but
I know it was a dull white and had strange

932
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:36,489
large greyish-red eyes.

933
01:15:36,489 --> 01:15:41,940
Also, there was fair hair on its head and
down its back.

934
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:49,670
I can't say whether it ran on four legs or
only with its arms held very low.

935
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:54,420
After a few seconds I followed it into the
second pile of ruins.

936
01:15:54,420 --> 01:16:02,590
'I couldn't find it at first, but after some
time in the deep darkness I saw one of those

937
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:10,550
round well-like openings that I have told
you about, half-closed by a large fallen stone.

938
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:12,950
A sudden thought came to me.

939
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:16,420
Had the thing disappeared down the well?

940
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:28,200
'I lit a match and, looking down, saw a small
white moving creature with large bright eyes.

941
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:32,230
It stared at me as it climbed down.

942
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:38,250
Now I saw for the first time a kind of metal
ladder down the side of the well.

943
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:44,660
Then the light burned my fingers and fell
out of my hand, going out as it dropped.

944
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:49,420
I lit another but the horrible little creature
had disappeared.

945
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:55,540
'I don't know how long I sat staring down
that well.

946
01:16:55,540 --> 01:17:01,389
Time passed before I could make myself believe
that I had seen something human.

947
01:17:01,389 --> 01:17:08,510
But slowly I began to understand the truth:
that humans hadn't stayed as one species,

948
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:12,690
but had become two different animals.

949
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:17,719
My pleasant children of the Upper-world weren't
alone.

950
01:17:17,719 --> 01:17:25,560
'And what, I wondered, was this creature of
the dark doing in my idea of a perfectly organised

951
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,530
society?

952
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:33,790
What was its relationship with the calm laziness
of the beautiful Upper-world people?

953
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:37,420
And what was hidden down there?

954
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:42,000
I sat on the edge of the well telling myself
that there was nothing to fear and that I

955
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,630
must go down to find the answer.

956
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:48,360
But I was very afraid to go!

957
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:53,180
As I sat there, two of the Upper-world people
came running across the daylight into the

958
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:54,409
shadow.

959
01:17:54,409 --> 01:17:59,030
The male followed the female, throwing flowers
at her as he ran.

960
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:02,790
'They seemed upset to find me looking down
the well.

961
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:07,290
I understood that it was bad behaviour to
look down these holes, because when I pointed

962
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:12,510
to this one and tried to make a question about
it in their language, they grew even more

963
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:15,370
upset and turned away.

964
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:20,730
But they were interested in my matches and
I struck some to amuse them.

965
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:25,739
I asked them again about the well, and again
I failed.

966
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:31,739
So I soon left them, intending to go back
to Weena and see what she could tell me.

967
01:18:31,739 --> 01:18:35,719
'But my mind was already working.

968
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:42,250
I now had an idea of the importance of these
wells, of the mystery of the ghosts, of the

969
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:46,930
meaning of the metal panels and what had happened
to the Time Machine!

970
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:54,380
And I also had the beginnings of a solution
to the economic mystery that had worried me.

971
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:57,700
'Here was my new idea.

972
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:03,400
Clearly, this second human species lived underground.

973
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:08,640
There were three things especially which made
me think this.

974
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:15,430
First, there was the white skin common to
most animals that live largely in the dark.

975
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:21,770
Then there were those large eyes, like those
of a cat.

976
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:27,590
Finally, its confusion in the sunshine, how
it ran into the stones, the strange way it

977
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:35,190
held its head - all these things made me believe
that its eyes weren't used to the light.

978
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:43,370
'Under my feet, then, there must be many tunnels,
where these people lived.

979
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:49,260
The wells, which carried air to them, were
all along the hillsides - everywhere, in fact,

980
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:52,620
except along the river valley.

981
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:57,390
Their great number showed how many tunnels
there were.

982
01:19:57,390 --> 01:20:02,610
It seemed natural, too, to believe that the
underground people made things for the comfort

983
01:20:02,610 --> 01:20:05,040
of the daylight people.

984
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:11,020
The idea was so sensible that I accepted it
at once, and then thought about how humans

985
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:15,120
had turned into two species.

986
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:20,350
'Starting with the problems of our own age,
it seemed clear to me that the widening of

987
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:27,469
the social difference between the worker and
the manager explained the whole situation.

988
01:20:27,469 --> 01:20:30,949
Even now we can see the beginnings of this.

989
01:20:30,949 --> 01:20:37,620
We have begun to make use of underground space
- we have railways, underground workrooms

990
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:42,340
and restaurants, and these are becoming more
common.

991
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:48,250
It was clear, I thought, that workers had
begun to go underground into larger and larger

992
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:55,720
factories, spending more and more of their
time there, until, in the end...

993
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:01,989
'Also, the increasing difference between the
social classes made marriage between them

994
01:21:01,989 --> 01:21:04,450
less and less frequent.

995
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:11,010
So above the ground now were the Haves, looking
for pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below

996
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:17,909
ground the Have-nots, the workers, changed
by the demands of their jobs.

997
01:21:17,909 --> 01:21:24,440
'When they were there, they had to pay rent,
and not a little of it, for the air coming

998
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,480
to their homes.

999
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,949
If they refused, they would die.

1000
01:21:28,949 --> 01:21:34,250
If they couldn't live in this way, they would
also die.

1001
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:40,739
In the end, everyone living underground would
be used to the conditions of their life, and

1002
01:21:40,739 --> 01:21:45,080
as happy in their way as the Upper- world
people were.

1003
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:51,220
'This, I must warn you, was my explanation
at the time.

1004
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:57,700
It may be completely wrong but I still think
it is the best one.

1005
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:02,159
But I think this way of life had worked better
in the past.

1006
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:09,409
The Upper- world people had become too safe,
and so had become smaller, weaker and less

1007
01:22:09,409 --> 01:22:10,610
intelligent.

1008
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:15,409
'I didn't yet know what had happened to the
underground people.

1009
01:22:15,409 --> 01:22:20,770
But I could imagine that the changes to the
Morlocks - that, I discovered later, was their

1010
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:27,330
name - were even greater than the changes
to the Eloi, the ones I already knew.

1011
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:31,710
'Then came worrying doubts.

1012
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:35,310
Why had the Morlocks taken my Time Machine?

1013
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:37,480
I felt sure they had taken it.

1014
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:44,650
Why, too, if the Eloi were in control, could
they not get my machine back for me?

1015
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:48,770
And why were they so terribly afraid of the
dark?

1016
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:56,139
As I have said, I questioned Weena about this
Under-world, but I learned nothing from her.

1017
01:22:56,139 --> 01:23:02,139
'At first she didn't understand my questions
and later she refused to answer them.

1018
01:23:02,139 --> 01:23:06,199
The whole subject seemed too unpleasant.

1019
01:23:06,199 --> 01:23:12,570
And when I asked her again, perhaps a little
loudly, she began to cry.

1020
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:18,350
They were the only tears, except my own, that
I ever saw in that Golden Age.

1021
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:24,350
'When I saw those tears, I stopped worrying
about the Morlocks.

1022
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:32,150
I lit a match and very soon she was smiling
again.

1023
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:33,870
CHAPTER NINE

1024
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:34,870
Underground

1025
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:45,420
'It may seem odd to you, but it was two days
before I could find out more about the Morlocks.

1026
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:50,090
I felt a strange fear of those pale bodies.

1027
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:56,631
They were just the same colour as the things
one sees in jars in a museum and they were

1028
01:23:56,631 --> 01:24:00,600
horribly cold when you touched them.

1029
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,290
I knew I could only get to the Time Machine
by going underground.

1030
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:07,189
But I couldn't do it.

1031
01:24:07,189 --> 01:24:13,020
I was so alone, and even the idea of climbing
down into the darkness of the well frightened

1032
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,370
me.

1033
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:19,500
'The next night I did not sleep well.

1034
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,910
Probably my health had suffered a little.

1035
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:25,489
I was confused and unhappy.

1036
01:24:25,489 --> 01:24:31,660
Once or twice I had a feeling of great fear
for which I could see no definite reason.

1037
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:36,720
I remember walking noiselessly into the great
hall where the little people were sleeping

1038
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:43,520
- that night Weena was among them - and feeling
more comfortable in their company.

1039
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:49,550
I realised that the moon was in its last quarter
and the nights were growing darker, and that

1040
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:55,700
there might be more appearances of those unpleasant
creatures from below.

1041
01:24:55,700 --> 01:25:01,170
And on both these days I had the restless
feeling of someone who is trying to escape

1042
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:03,239
a duty.

1043
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:12,040
I felt that I could only get the Time Machine
back if I understood these underground mysteries.

1044
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:18,030
But I wasn't brave enough to solve the mysteries,
and I never quite felt safe.

1045
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:24,450
'These worries drove me further and further
in my walks around the country.

1046
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:31,430
Going south-west towards the higher country,
I saw, far away, an enormous building.

1047
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:39,730
It was larger than the largest of the palaces
or ruins I knew, and the front was pale green.

1048
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:45,090
The difference in appearance suggested a difference
in use, and I thought about going to look

1049
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:46,730
around.

1050
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:52,159
But it was growing late so I decided to wait
until the following day, and I returned to

1051
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:54,290
Weena's welcome.

1052
01:25:54,290 --> 01:26:02,100
'But the next morning I realised that my interest
in the Green Palace was just helping me to

1053
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:05,469
delay an experience I was afraid of.

1054
01:26:05,469 --> 01:26:13,199
I decided that I would go down without wasting
any more time, and walked in the early morning

1055
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:16,290
towards a well near the ruins.

1056
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:22,470
'Little Weena danced beside me to the well,
but when she saw me bend over the opening

1057
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:25,550
and look down, she seemed upset.

1058
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:31,719
"Goodbye, little Weena," I said, kissing her,
and then I began to feel over the edge for

1059
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,800
the metal steps.

1060
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,659
'At first she watched me with surprise.

1061
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:43,830
Then she gave a most heartbreaking cry and,
running to me, began to pull at me with her

1062
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:45,080
little hands.

1063
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:48,700
I think her fear made me braver.

1064
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:53,670
I shook her off and in another moment I was
inside the well.

1065
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:59,900
I saw her frightened face over the top and
smiled to make her feel better.

1066
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:06,070
'I had to climb down a well perhaps two hundred
metres deep.

1067
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:11,530
There were metal bars all the way down, but
these were made for a person much smaller

1068
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:16,699
and lighter than I was and I was quickly tired
by the climb.

1069
01:27:16,699 --> 01:27:19,110
And not simply tired!

1070
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:24,130
One of the bars bent suddenly under my weight
and almost threw me off into the blackness

1071
01:27:24,130 --> 01:27:25,600
below.

1072
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:34,130
For the moment I hung by one hand, and after
that I didn't dare to rest again.

1073
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:42,370
'Although my arms and back were very painful,
I continued climbing down as quickly as possible.

1074
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:50,640
Looking up, I saw the opening, a small blue
circle, where Weena's head was round and black.

1075
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:54,650
The noise of a machine grew louder.

1076
01:27:54,650 --> 01:28:02,139
Everything except that little circle above
was very dark, and when I looked up again

1077
01:28:02,139 --> 01:28:04,700
she had disappeared.

1078
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:08,880
'I was in great discomfort and thought of
going up again.

1079
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,739
But I continued to climb down.

1080
01:28:12,739 --> 01:28:19,570
At last, with great happiness, I saw, half
a metre to the right of me, a thin opening

1081
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:20,870
in the wall.

1082
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:27,239
Fulling myself in, I found it was the start
of a narrow tunnel in which I could lie down

1083
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:28,980
and rest.

1084
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:30,760
It was not too soon.

1085
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:38,550
'I lay there, I don't know how long, until
I felt a soft hand touching my face.

1086
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:43,889
Quickly getting to my feet in the darkness,
I pulled out my matches.

1087
01:28:43,889 --> 01:28:51,770
I struck one and saw three white figures moving
quickly back, away from the light.

1088
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:58,820
Their eyes, unusually large from living in
darkness, were like those of deep-water fish,

1089
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:02,080
and reflected the light in the same way.

1090
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:07,750
I have no doubt they could see me and they
didn't seem to have any fear of me, only of

1091
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:09,000
the light.

1092
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,699
'The thought of running away was still in
my mind, but I told myself that the job had

1093
01:29:14,699 --> 01:29:16,460
to be done.

1094
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:21,790
As I felt my way along the tunnel, the noise
of machinery grew louder.

1095
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:29,130
Soon I came to a large open space and, striking
another match, saw that I had entered an enormous

1096
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:31,520
underground room.

1097
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,460
It stretched into total darkness beyond my
light.

1098
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:42,840
'Great shapes like large machines rose out
of the darkness, and made strange shadows

1099
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:47,050
in which I could see the shapes of Morlocks
hiding.

1100
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:54,520
The air wasn't very fresh and there was a
faint smell of fresh blood.

1101
01:29:54,520 --> 01:30:00,719
Some way down the central path was a little
table of white metal, covered with food.

1102
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,250
So the Morlocks, at least, were meat-eaters!

1103
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:11,350
'Even at the time, I remember wondering what
large animal still lived to produce the red

1104
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:14,510
piece of meat that I saw.

1105
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:20,760
Then the match burned down to my fingers and
fell, a moving red spot in the darkness.

1106
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:28,719
'I have thought since then how very badly-prepared
I was for such an experience.

1107
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:33,369
When I had started building the Time Machine,
I had had the stupid idea that the people

1108
01:30:33,369 --> 01:30:38,390
of the future would certainly be far ahead
of us in all their inventions.

1109
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:45,790
I had come without weapons, without medicine,
without tobacco, even without enough matches.

1110
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:51,150
'I didn't even think of bringing a camera,
so I couldn't take a picture of that Under-world,

1111
01:30:51,150 --> 01:30:53,830
to examine later.

1112
01:30:53,830 --> 01:31:01,540
I stood there with only the weapons that nature
had given me - hands, feet and teeth - and

1113
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:05,430
the four matches that I had left.

1114
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:11,139
I was afraid to push my way in among all this
machinery in the dark, and then I discovered

1115
01:31:11,139 --> 01:31:14,190
that I had almost finished my matches.

1116
01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:19,030
I had never thought that there was any need
to save them and I had wasted almost half

1117
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:22,000
the box surprising the Eloi.

1118
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:30,989
Now I had four left, and while I stood in
the dark a hand touched mine and cold fingers

1119
01:31:30,989 --> 01:31:33,719
began feeling my face.

1120
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:40,909
'I thought I could hear the breathing of a
crowd of those horrible little creatures around

1121
01:31:40,909 --> 01:31:42,199
me.

1122
01:31:42,199 --> 01:31:48,260
I felt the box of matches in my hand being
gently pulled away, and other hands behind

1123
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:50,369
me pulling at my clothes.

1124
01:31:50,369 --> 01:31:52,640
I shouted as loudly as I could.

1125
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:57,370
'They jumped back, and then I could feel them
coming towards me again.

1126
01:31:57,370 --> 01:32:02,469
They took hold of me more strongly, whispering
odd sounds to each other.

1127
01:32:02,469 --> 01:32:05,780
I shook violently and shouted again.

1128
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:11,290
This time they weren't so worried, and they
made a strange laughing noise as they came

1129
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:13,699
back at me.

1130
01:32:13,699 --> 01:32:17,060
T was horribly frightened.

1131
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:22,369
I decided to strike another match and escape
under the protection of its light.

1132
01:32:22,369 --> 01:32:28,619
I did so and, keeping the flame burning with
a piece of paper from my pocket, I moved quickly

1133
01:32:28,619 --> 01:32:29,739
into the narrow tunnel.

1134
01:32:29,739 --> 01:32:36,600
But I had just entered this when my light
was blown out, and in the blackness I could

1135
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,100
hear the Morlocks hurrying after me.

1136
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:45,369
'In a moment I was held by several hands,
trying to pull me back.

1137
01:32:45,369 --> 01:32:48,540
I struck another light and waved it in their
faces.

1138
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:55,260
You can't imagine how horribly inhuman they
looked in their blindness and surprise.

1139
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:57,320
But I didn't stay.

1140
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:03,080
I moved back again and when my second match
went out, I struck my third.

1141
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:06,580
It had almost burned down when I reached the
opening into the well.

1142
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:11,460
'I lay down on the edge and felt for the metal
bars.

1143
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:17,190
As I did so, my feet were held from behind
and I was violently pulled backwards.

1144
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:19,800
I lit my last match... and it went out.

1145
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:26,989
But I had my hand on the bars now and, kicking
violently, I got myself free of the hands

1146
01:33:26,989 --> 01:33:31,850
of the Morlocks and quickly climbed up the
well.

1147
01:33:31,850 --> 01:33:39,010
They stayed, afraid of the light, all except
one little one who followed me for some way,

1148
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:42,340
and almost got my shoe as a prize.

1149
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:46,530
'That climb never seemed to end.

1150
01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:52,580
In the last eight or ten metres of it, a terrible
feeling of sickness came over me.

1151
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:56,460
I had the greatest difficulty holding the
bars.

1152
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:59,330
Several times I thought that I might fall.

1153
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:06,760
At last, though, I got over the top of the
well, and walked shakily out of the ruin into

1154
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:09,130
the blinding sunlight.

1155
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:12,450
'I fell on my face.

1156
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:15,010
Even the earth felt sweet and clean.

1157
01:34:15,010 --> 01:34:23,389
Then I remember Weena kissing my hands and
ears, and the voices of others among the Eloi.

1158
01:34:23,389 --> 01:34:31,430
Then, for a time, I remember nothing.

1159
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:33,159
CHAPTER TEN

1160
01:34:33,159 --> 01:34:36,480
A Place to Live

1161
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:40,239
'Now I seemed in a worse position than before.

1162
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:46,369
Until then, except during my night of madness
over the disappearance of the Time Machine,

1163
01:34:46,369 --> 01:34:51,639
I had felt that in the end I would escape.

1164
01:34:51,639 --> 01:34:55,540
But that hope was shaken by these new discoveries.

1165
01:34:55,540 --> 01:35:00,380
I had been worried by the thought of unknown
forces which I could beat when I understood

1166
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:01,659
them.

1167
01:35:01,659 --> 01:35:04,790
The situation was different now.

1168
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:10,650
There was something sickening about the Morlocks
- something inhuman.

1169
01:35:10,650 --> 01:35:17,469
Before, I had felt like a man who had fallen
into a hole: my worry was how to get out of

1170
01:35:17,469 --> 01:35:19,130
it.

1171
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:26,840
Now I felt like an animal which had been caught,
whose enemy would come to him soon.

1172
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:33,630
'That enemy was the darkness of the new moon.

1173
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:40,940
Weena had put this fear into my head by some
things she said, which at first I didn't understand,

1174
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:43,969
about the Dark Nights.

1175
01:35:43,969 --> 01:35:49,010
Now I could guess what the coming Dark Nights
might mean.

1176
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:54,870
The moon was getting smaller and each night
there was a longer time of darkness.

1177
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:59,199
And I now understood a little of the Eloi's
fear of the dark.

1178
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:04,780
I wondered what terrible things the Morlocks
did under the new moon.

1179
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:12,610
'The Eloi had probably been the managers and
the Morlocks their servants, but that situation

1180
01:36:12,610 --> 01:36:16,239
had changed a long time before.

1181
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:24,590
The two species were moving towards, or had
already arrived at, a completely new relationship.

1182
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:30,940
The Eloi were still allowed to own the world,
because the Morlocks, underground for so long,

1183
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:34,080
now found the daylight impossible.

1184
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:41,060
And the Morlocks made their clothes, I thought,
and did other necessary things for them, perhaps

1185
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:44,020
because an old habit of service had continued.

1186
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:50,020
'But clearly, the end of the Eloi's power
was coming closer.

1187
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:56,679
And suddenly I thought of the meat I had seen
in the Underworld.

1188
01:36:56,679 --> 01:36:59,810
I tried to remember its shape.

1189
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:07,100
I had a feeling it was something familiar,
but I hadn't recognised it at the time.

1190
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:14,090
'The little people could do nothing about
their fear, but I was made differently.

1191
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:21,790
I came out of our age, this best time for
humans, when fear doesn't make us helpless.

1192
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:25,310
I at least could defend myself.

1193
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:32,270
Without further delay I decided to make myself
weapons and a safe place where I could sleep.

1194
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:39,180
From there, I could face this strange world
with some of that confidence.

1195
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:44,770
I had been slow to realise what creatures
could harm me night after night.

1196
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:51,330
I felt I could never sleep again until my
bed was safe from them.

1197
01:37:51,330 --> 01:37:56,090
I shook with fear to think how they had already
examined me.

1198
01:37:56,090 --> 01:38:03,410
'I walked during the afternoon along the valley
of the Thames, but found nowhere that seemed

1199
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:04,679
safe.

1200
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:09,700
All the buildings and trees seemed easy for
such good climbers as the Morlocks to get

1201
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:14,440
into, judging by their skill at entering and
leaving their wells.

1202
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:18,139
Then the Green Palace came into my mind.

1203
01:38:18,139 --> 01:38:24,739
In the evening, carrying Weena like a child
on my shoulders, I went up into the hills

1204
01:38:24,739 --> 01:38:27,080
towards the south-west.

1205
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:33,070
The distance, I had thought, was eleven or
twelve kilometres, but it was probably nearer

1206
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:34,070
thirty.

1207
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:41,429
'I had first seen the place on a wet afternoon
when things in the distance seemed nearer.

1208
01:38:41,429 --> 01:38:47,420
In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was
loose, so I couldn't walk well.

1209
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:53,260
And it was already long past sunset when I
came in sight of the palace, dark against

1210
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,620
the pale yellow of the sky.

1211
01:38:55,620 --> 01:39:01,310
'Weena had been very pleased when I began
to carry her, but later she wanted me to put

1212
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:03,440
her down.

1213
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:10,260
She ran along by my side, occasionally going
off to pick flowers to put in my pockets.

1214
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:15,040
Weena had been unsure of the purpose of pockets,
but had decided that they should be filled

1215
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,030
and decorated with flowers.

1216
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:19,440
And that reminds me!

1217
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:23,380
While changing my jacket I found...'

1218
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:32,159
The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into
his pocket and silently placed two dead flowers

1219
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:34,830
on the little table.

1220
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:36,909
Then he went back to his story.

1221
01:39:36,909 --> 01:39:43,850
'As the quiet of evening spread over the world
and we moved over the top of the hill towards

1222
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:50,489
Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to
return to the house of grey stone.

1223
01:39:50,489 --> 01:39:55,610
But I pointed to the Green Palace, and tried
to make her understand that we were looking

1224
01:39:55,610 --> 01:39:58,739
for a safe place there.

1225
01:39:58,739 --> 01:40:02,060
'You know that quietness that comes before
dark?

1226
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:08,239
In that calm my senses seemed to sharpen.

1227
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:13,251
I thought that I could almost see the tunnels
in the ground under my feet - that I could

1228
01:40:13,251 --> 01:40:19,730
see the Morlocks going here and there and
waiting for the dark.

1229
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:25,230
In my excitement I imagined that they would
see my arrival in their homes as an act of

1230
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:27,800
war.

1231
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:32,580
'So we continued and the evening turned into
night.

1232
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:38,450
The ground grew difficult to see and the trees
turned black.

1233
01:40:38,450 --> 01:40:42,890
Weena's fears and her tiredness grew.

1234
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:46,040
I took her in my arms and talked to her.

1235
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:51,750
Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put
her arms round my neck.

1236
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:56,810
Closing her eyes, she tightly pressed her
face against my shoulder.

1237
01:40:56,810 --> 01:41:04,790
'So we went down a long hillside into a valley,
and there in the poor light I almost fell

1238
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:06,880
into a little river.

1239
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,811
I walked across this and went up the opposite
side.

1240
01:41:09,811 --> 01:41:16,560
I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it
was still early in the night.

1241
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:22,720
The darker hours before the moon came up hadn't
yet arrived.

1242
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:29,830
'From the top of the next hill I saw a thick
wood spreading wide and black in front of

1243
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:31,260
me.

1244
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:33,680
I stopped at this.

1245
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:39,260
I could see no end to it, either to the right
or the left.

1246
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:44,520
Feeling tired - my feet, especially, were
very painful - I carefully lowered Weena from

1247
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:49,940
my shoulder as I stopped, and sat down on
the grass.

1248
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:54,550
I could no longer see the Green Palace, and
I wasn't sure of my direction.

1249
01:41:54,550 --> 01:42:00,949
'I looked into the thickness of the wood and
thought of what it might hide.

1250
01:42:00,949 --> 01:42:05,179
In there, we might be out of sight of the
stars.

1251
01:42:05,179 --> 01:42:09,409
Even if there were no other waiting danger,
there would still be many things to fall over

1252
01:42:09,409 --> 01:42:11,670
and walk into.

1253
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:17,360
I was very tired, too, after the excitement
of the day, so I decided that I wouldn't face

1254
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:22,230
it, but would spend the night on the open
hill.

1255
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:26,949
'Weena, I was glad to find, was asleep.

1256
01:42:26,949 --> 01:42:33,440
I put my jacket round her and sat down beside
her to wait for the moon to rise.

1257
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:41,580
The hillside was quiet and empty, but from
the black of the wood came, now and then,

1258
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:45,140
the sound of living things.

1259
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:51,369
Above me the stars shone, because the night
was very clear, and I felt a sense of friendly

1260
01:42:51,369 --> 01:42:54,389
comfort from their lights.

1261
01:42:54,389 --> 01:43:01,070
All the familiar old ones had moved in the
sky, rearranged in new groups during countless

1262
01:43:01,070 --> 01:43:03,260
human lifetimes.

1263
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:10,719
'As I looked at all these stars, I suddenly
felt that my problems were smaller.

1264
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:16,739
I thought of their distance, and their slow
movements out of the unknown past into the

1265
01:43:16,739 --> 01:43:18,360
unknown future.

1266
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:27,099
And in my time travelling forwards, all the
activity, the traditions, the organisations,

1267
01:43:27,099 --> 01:43:36,219
the nations, languages, literature, hopes,
even the memory of humans as I knew them,

1268
01:43:36,219 --> 01:43:38,310
had totally disappeared.

1269
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:45,800
Instead, there were these weak people who
had forgotten their great history, and the

1270
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:50,500
white Things of which I was so afraid.

1271
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:55,840
'Then I thought of the great fear between
the two species.

1272
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:59,860
I thought about the meat that I had seen.

1273
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:04,340
And for the first time I understood what it
might be.

1274
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:08,719
But the thought was too horrible!

1275
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:15,580
I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me,
her face white under the stars, and put the

1276
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:18,140
thought from my mind.

1277
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:25,210
'Through that long night I kept my mind off
the Morlocks as well as I could.

1278
01:44:25,210 --> 01:44:31,420
I passed the time by trying to find signs
of the old groups of stars in the sky.

1279
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:33,659
No doubt I slept a little.

1280
01:44:33,659 --> 01:44:42,010
Then, as time passed, there came a soft light
in the eastern sky and the old moon came up,

1281
01:44:42,010 --> 01:44:46,480
thin and pointed and white.

1282
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:52,889
And close behind, and stronger, came the light
from the sun.

1283
01:44:52,889 --> 01:44:55,020
'No Morlocks had come near us.

1284
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:58,460
In fact, I had seen none on the hills that
night.

1285
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:06,330
And in the confidence of the new day it almost
seemed to me that I had been wrong to be afraid.

1286
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:12,139
I stood up and found my foot with the loose
heel was painful, so I sat down again, took

1287
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:15,119
off my shoes and threw them away.

1288
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:21,510
'I woke Weena and we went down into the wood,
now green and pleasant instead of black and

1289
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:23,810
unwelcoming.

1290
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:26,670
We found some fruit there to eat for breakfast.

1291
01:45:26,670 --> 01:45:30,042
We soon met other Eloi, laughing and dancing
in the sunlight.

1292
01:45:30,042 --> 01:45:38,179
And then I thought again of the meat that
I had seen.

1293
01:45:38,179 --> 01:45:45,170
I felt sure now what it was and with all my
heart I pitied them.

1294
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:52,580
'Clearly, at some time in the past, the Morlocks
hadn't been able to find enough food.

1295
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:56,909
Possibly they had lived on rats and similar
animals.

1296
01:45:56,909 --> 01:46:02,880
Now the Eloi were like fat cows, which the
Morlocks kept and hunted.

1297
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:07,730
And there was Weena dancing at my side!

1298
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:13,240
'I tried to think more scientifically, and
less emotionally.

1299
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:16,690
Perhaps this was a punishment for human selfishness.

1300
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:20,119
Some people had been happy to live from the
work of others.

1301
01:46:20,119 --> 01:46:26,340
They had said this was necessary, and in time
it had become equally necessary for the workers

1302
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:27,739
to eat them.

1303
01:46:27,739 --> 01:46:31,290
But this attitude was impossible.

1304
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:37,190
It didn't matter how unintelligent they were,
the Eloi still looked human.

1305
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:42,700
I understood their situation and I felt their
fear.

1306
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:49,040
'I had at that time no clear ideas about what
I should do.

1307
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:55,150
I thought I could find a safe place and make
myself some weapons out of metal or stone.

1308
01:46:55,150 --> 01:47:00,849
Next I hoped to find a way of making fire,
so I would have the weapon of a torch.

1309
01:47:00,849 --> 01:47:05,130
I knew that nothing would work better against
these Morlocks.

1310
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:10,920
Then I wanted to find a way of breaking open
the metal panels under the white sphinx.

1311
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:18,599
'I felt that if I could enter those doors
and carry a light in front of me I would discover

1312
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:22,480
the Time Machine and escape.

1313
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:27,420
I couldn't imagine that the Morlocks were
strong enough to move it far away.

1314
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:31,929
I had decided to bring Weena with me to our
own time.

1315
01:47:31,929 --> 01:47:38,849
And thinking about plans like these, we walked
towards the building which I had chosen as

1316
01:47:38,849 --> 01:47:42,270
our home.

1317
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:44,260
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1318
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:47,699
The Green Palace

1319
01:47:47,699 --> 01:47:53,739
I found the Green Palace, when we came to
it at about midday, to be empty and falling

1320
01:47:53,739 --> 01:47:55,750
into ruin.

1321
01:47:55,750 --> 01:48:01,290
The glass in its windows was broken and large
pieces of green material had fallen off the

1322
01:48:01,290 --> 01:48:05,220
walls onto the ground.

1323
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:11,409
It stood high on a grassy hill and, looking
towards the north-east before I entered it,

1324
01:48:11,409 --> 01:48:15,969
I was surprised to see a large river where
I thought Wandsworth and Battersea had been

1325
01:48:15,969 --> 01:48:18,099
in the past.

1326
01:48:18,099 --> 01:48:25,199
I thought then of what had happened or might
be happening to the living things in the sea.

1327
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:31,290
'Along the front of the palace I saw writing
in an unknown language.

1328
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:37,310
I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might
help to understand this, but I only learned

1329
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:41,850
that the idea of writing had never entered
her head.

1330
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:48,560
She always seemed to me, I imagine, more human
than she was, perhaps because her love was

1331
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,699
so human.

1332
01:48:50,699 --> 01:48:58,670
Inside the large door - which was open and
broken - we found, instead of the usual hall,

1333
01:48:58,670 --> 01:49:02,340
a long room lit by many side windows.

1334
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:07,429
At first look I was reminded of a museum.

1335
01:49:07,429 --> 01:49:14,020
The floor was thick with dust, and an interesting
collection of strange objects was covered

1336
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:16,140
in grey dust too.

1337
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:22,500
Then I noticed, in the centre of the room,
the bones of a large animal.

1338
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:28,380
They lay on the floor in the thick dust, and
in one place, where the rainwater had come

1339
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:32,130
through the roof, some had almost been destroyed.

1340
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:35,869
'This made me feel sure that I was in a museum.

1341
01:49:35,869 --> 01:49:43,610
Going towards the side I found shelves and
on them I found the old familiar glass cases

1342
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:45,710
of our time.

1343
01:49:45,710 --> 01:49:52,050
They had kept the air out; the objects inside
were still in good condition.

1344
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:59,710
'I continued walking and found another short
room running across the end of the first.

1345
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:06,219
This appeared to be full of rocks, in which
I had little interest, so we didn't stop.

1346
01:50:06,219 --> 01:50:11,400
The next room appeared to be about natural
history, but everything had changed so much

1347
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,179
that it was unrecognisable.

1348
01:50:13,179 --> 01:50:20,989
A few blackened things which had been animals
many years before, a brown dust of dead plants,

1349
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:23,290
that was all!

1350
01:50:23,290 --> 01:50:30,780
I was sorry about that, because I wanted to
know how people had learned to control nature.

1351
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:37,740
'Then we came to an enormous room, which was
very badly- lit.

1352
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:44,200
Every few metres, white glass balls hung from
the ceiling - many of them broken - which

1353
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:48,230
suggested that the place had had electric
lighting.

1354
01:50:48,230 --> 01:50:55,090
On either side of me were large machines,
all in bad condition and many broken down,

1355
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:57,580
but some still quite complete.

1356
01:50:57,580 --> 01:51:03,400
I wanted to stay among these because I could
only make guesses at what they were for.

1357
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:09,140
I thought that if I could learn to understand
them, I would have powers that might be useful

1358
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:12,550
against the Morlocks.

1359
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:18,250
'Suddenly Weena came very close to my side,
so suddenly that she surprised me.

1360
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:25,040
I woke out of my dream and then noticed that
the floor of the room went downhill.

1361
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:32,370
I had come in at an end that was above ground,
and had a few tail thin windows.

1362
01:51:32,370 --> 01:51:38,099
As you went down the room, the ground came
up against these windows, until finally there

1363
01:51:38,099 --> 01:51:41,380
was only a narrow line of daylight at the
top.

1364
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:47,480
'I had moved slowly, thinking about the machines,
and had been too interested in them to notice

1365
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:50,139
that it was getting dark.

1366
01:51:50,139 --> 01:51:55,579
Then Weena's increasing nervousness made me
realise that the room ran down into thick

1367
01:51:55,579 --> 01:51:57,750
darkness.

1368
01:51:57,750 --> 01:52:05,470
I stopped and, as I looked around me, I saw
that the dust was thinner there.

1369
01:52:05,470 --> 01:52:11,199
Further away towards the darkness, it appeared
to be broken by a number of small, narrow

1370
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:13,170
footprints.

1371
01:52:13,170 --> 01:52:18,469
'I felt that I was wasting my time looking
at this machinery.

1372
01:52:18,469 --> 01:52:24,040
I remembered that it was already late in the
afternoon and that I still had no weapon,

1373
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:28,200
no safe place and no way of making a fire.

1374
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:34,790
And then down at the far end of the room I
heard the sound of footsteps and the same

1375
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:37,910
strange noises I had heard down the well.

1376
01:52:37,910 --> 01:52:40,429
'I took Weena's hand.

1377
01:52:40,429 --> 01:52:46,560
Then, getting a sudden idea, I left her and
turned to a machine on which there was a long

1378
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,810
metal bar.

1379
01:52:48,810 --> 01:52:54,449
Climbing up, and taking this in my hands,
I put all my weight on it sideways.

1380
01:52:54,449 --> 01:53:00,760
It broke after a few seconds, and I rejoined
Weena with a weapon in my hand.

1381
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:06,540
It was heavy enough, I thought, to break the
head of any Morlock I might meet.

1382
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:12,139
And I wanted very much to kill a Morlock or
two.

1383
01:53:12,139 --> 01:53:16,710
I wanted to go straight down the room and
kill the ones I heard.

1384
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:21,620
I didn't do this, though, partly because I
also wanted to stay with Weena - and to get

1385
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:23,760
back to my Time Machine.

1386
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:30,420
'Well, with the metal bar in one hand and
Weena in the other, I went out of that room

1387
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:36,020
and into another even larger one, which was
full of old books.

1388
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:40,750
These had fallen to pieces and none of the
words could be read.

1389
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:45,620
I'm not a great writer, so didn't spend too
long thinking about this waste of time and

1390
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:52,150
energy, but I did think sadly of my own seventeen
papers on scientific subjects.

1391
01:53:52,150 --> 01:53:59,020
'Then, going up the wide stairs, we came to
a room that had perhaps been a science room.

1392
01:53:59,020 --> 01:54:03,980
And here I had some hopes of finding something
useful.

1393
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:09,960
Except at one end where the roof had fallen
down, this room was in good condition.

1394
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:13,219
I went quickly to every unbroken case.

1395
01:54:13,219 --> 01:54:18,030
At last, in one of them, I found a box of
matches.

1396
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:20,440
Very excited, I tried them.

1397
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:23,380
They were dry and perfectly good.

1398
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:25,930
'I turned to Weena.

1399
01:54:25,930 --> 01:54:32,200
"Dance," I said to her in her own language,
because now I really had a weapon against

1400
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:35,260
the horrible creatures that we were afraid
of.

1401
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:43,750
And so, in that broken-down museum, on the
thick, soft carpet of dust, to Weena's great

1402
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:49,849
happiness, I danced a slow dance, singing
a song as well as I could.

1403
01:54:49,849 --> 01:54:56,360
Partly the dance was from different countries,
partly it was my own invention - because I

1404
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:59,790
am naturally inventive, as you know.

1405
01:54:59,790 --> 01:55:06,380
'It was strange that this box of matches had
lasted for so many years, but it was very

1406
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:08,460
fortunate for me.

1407
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:15,560
And I also found something even less likely
- a jar containing a number of candles.

1408
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:21,730
I broke it open, put these in my pocket and
left that room very happy.

1409
01:55:21,730 --> 01:55:27,079
'I can't tell you all the story of that long
afternoon.

1410
01:55:27,079 --> 01:55:32,010
I would have to think hard to remember what
I saw in the correct order.

1411
01:55:32,010 --> 01:55:39,150
I remember a long room filled with guns, and
although some were still in good condition,

1412
01:55:39,150 --> 01:55:42,119
I could find no bullets.

1413
01:55:42,119 --> 01:55:49,790
In another place was a large collection of
stone and metal gods - Polynesian, Mexican,

1414
01:55:49,790 --> 01:55:55,139
Greek, Roman, from every country on Earth,
I think.

1415
01:55:55,139 --> 01:56:03,340
And here I couldn't help writing my name on
the nose of a stone god from South America

1416
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:06,579
that I really liked.

1417
01:56:06,579 --> 01:56:11,139
'As evening came, my interest level fell.

1418
01:56:11,139 --> 01:56:17,849
I went through room after room: dusty, silent,
often ruined.

1419
01:56:17,849 --> 01:56:23,830
Some things were just piles of broken material;
some were in better condition.

1420
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:27,460
In the end we came to a little open square.

1421
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:32,579
It had grass and three fruit trees, so we
rested there.

1422
01:56:32,579 --> 01:56:38,560
'Towards sunset I began to think about our
situation.

1423
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:44,050
Night was getting closer and my safe hiding
place still had to be found.

1424
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:47,599
But that worried me very little now.

1425
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:54,310
I had with me, perhaps, the best of all defences
against the Morlocks - I had matches.

1426
01:56:54,310 --> 01:56:58,670
I had the candles in my pocket too, if more
light were needed.

1427
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:05,650
'It seemed to me that we should spend the
night in the open, protected by a fire.

1428
01:57:05,650 --> 01:57:09,449
In the morning I could try to get the Time
Machine.

1429
01:57:09,449 --> 01:57:13,890
To do that, at that time, I had only my metal
bar.

1430
01:57:13,890 --> 01:57:21,190
But now, with my growing knowledge, I felt
very differently about those metal panels.

1431
01:57:21,190 --> 01:57:25,989
I had never thought they were very strong,
and I hoped that the metal bar would be heavy

1432
01:57:25,989 --> 01:57:29,469
enough to do the job.

1433
01:57:29,469 --> 01:57:33,869
CHAPTER TWELVE

1434
01:57:33,869 --> 01:57:34,869
Fear of Fire

1435
01:57:34,869 --> 01:57:42,580
'When we came out of the palace, the sun hadn't
completely gone down.

1436
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:47,170
I wanted to get through the woods before it
was dark, and to reach the white sphinx early

1437
01:57:47,170 --> 01:57:49,060
the next morning.

1438
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:55,390
My plan was to go as far as possible that
night and then build a fire and sleep in the

1439
01:57:55,390 --> 01:57:57,780
protection of its light.

1440
01:57:57,780 --> 01:58:03,870
So as we went along I collected sticks and
dry grass, and soon had my arms full.

1441
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:11,510
'Because of this, we walked more slowly than
I had expected, and also Weena was tired.

1442
01:58:11,510 --> 01:58:18,280
And I began to suffer from sleepiness too,
so it was night before we reached the wood.

1443
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:23,610
On a bushy hill at the edge of it, Weena wanted
to stop, afraid of the darkness in front of

1444
01:58:23,610 --> 01:58:24,610
us.

1445
01:58:24,610 --> 01:58:33,400
But a strong feeling of danger, that I failed
to see as a warning, made me continue.

1446
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:40,380
I had been without sleep for a night and two
days, and felt ill and bad-tempered.

1447
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:45,060
I felt sleep coming on me, and the Morlocks
with it.

1448
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:52,290
'Then, among the black bushes behind us, and
dark against their blackness, I saw three

1449
01:58:52,290 --> 01:58:56,060
figures close to the ground.

1450
01:58:56,060 --> 01:59:00,890
There was long grass all around us and I didn't
feel safe from them.

1451
01:59:00,890 --> 01:59:04,949
The forest, I thought, was about a kilometre
across.

1452
01:59:04,949 --> 01:59:11,540
If we could get through it to the open hillside,
that, it seemed to me, was a much safer resting-place.

1453
01:59:11,540 --> 01:59:19,280
'I thought that with my matches and my candles
I could keep my way lit through the woods.

1454
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:22,920
But I knew that I wouldn't be able to hold
my firewood too.

1455
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:28,310
So, rather unwillingly, I put it down.

1456
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:34,690
Then it came into my head that I would surprise
the Morlocks behind us by lighting it.

1457
01:59:34,690 --> 01:59:40,360
I soon discovered how stupid this was, but
at the time it seemed a good way of protecting

1458
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:42,340
our backs.

1459
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:49,409
'I don't know if you have ever thought what
an unusual thing fire must be where there

1460
01:59:49,409 --> 01:59:53,040
are no people and where the climate is cool.

1461
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:57,719
The sun's heat is not often strong enough
to burn plants, even when it shines through

1462
01:59:57,719 --> 02:00:02,550
a drop of water, as sometimes happens in hotter
places.

1463
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:08,420
Lightning may start small fires, but they
don't usually spread very far.

1464
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:14,429
In this future time, the way to make fire
had been forgotten in the world.

1465
02:00:14,429 --> 02:00:20,710
The red tongues climbing my pile of wood were
completely new and strange to Weena.

1466
02:00:20,710 --> 02:00:24,790
'She wanted to run to them and play with them.

1467
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:29,210
She almost threw herself on the fire, but
I held her back.

1468
02:00:29,210 --> 02:00:36,389
Then I picked her up and, although she fought
against me, I walked forwards into the wood.

1469
02:00:36,389 --> 02:00:41,139
For a short distance the light from my fire
showed us the way.

1470
02:00:41,139 --> 02:00:47,020
Looking back, I could see, through the many
trees, that from my pile of sticks the fire

1471
02:00:47,020 --> 02:00:48,719
had spread to some bushes.

1472
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:55,409
Now a curved red line was coming slowly up
the grass of the hill.

1473
02:00:55,409 --> 02:01:01,460
'I laughed at that, and turned again to the
dark trees in front of us.

1474
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:07,469
It was very black and Weena held on to me
in fear, but there was still, as my eyes got

1475
02:01:07,469 --> 02:01:12,520
used to the darkness, enough light for me
to walk around the trees.

1476
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:19,300
Above us it was simply black, except where
a piece of blue sky shone down on us here

1477
02:01:19,300 --> 02:01:21,190
and there.

1478
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:26,120
I struck none of my matches because I had
no hand free.

1479
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:33,330
With my left arm I carried my little friend;
in my right hand I had my metal bar.

1480
02:01:33,330 --> 02:01:42,011
'For some time I heard nothing except the
breaking of dry- wood under my feet, the low

1481
02:01:42,011 --> 02:01:48,380
sound of the wind above, my own breathing
and the beat of my heart.

1482
02:01:48,380 --> 02:01:53,880
Then I seemed to hear soft footsteps around
me.

1483
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:56,560
I kept moving.

1484
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:02,040
The footsteps grew louder and then I heard
the same strange sounds and voices I had heard

1485
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:03,560
in the Under-world.

1486
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:09,130
There seemed to be several of the Morlocks
and they were getting closer.

1487
02:02:09,130 --> 02:02:16,640
In fact, in another minute I felt one of them
pull at my coat, then something on my arm.

1488
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:21,330
Weena shook violently and then stopped moving.

1489
02:02:21,330 --> 02:02:22,800
'It was time for a match.

1490
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:26,159
But to get one I had to put her down.

1491
02:02:26,159 --> 02:02:32,579
I did so and, as I searched in my pocket,
a fight began in the darkness around my knees,

1492
02:02:32,579 --> 02:02:38,869
with no sounds from her and some strange bird-like
noises from the Morlocks.

1493
02:02:38,869 --> 02:02:44,520
Soft little hands, too, were moving over my
coat and back, even touching my neck.

1494
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:50,560
Then the match caught fire and I saw the white
backs of the Morlocks running away through

1495
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:52,290
the trees.

1496
02:02:52,290 --> 02:02:57,010
I quickly took a candle from my pocket and
prepared to light it.

1497
02:02:57,010 --> 02:03:01,489
'Then I looked at Weena.

1498
02:03:01,489 --> 02:03:08,409
She was lying with her face to the ground,
holding my feet and not moving.

1499
02:03:08,409 --> 02:03:13,260
With a sudden feeling of fear I bent down
to her.

1500
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:16,580
She seemed almost unable to breathe.

1501
02:03:16,580 --> 02:03:24,159
I lit the candle and placed it on the ground,
and as the flame grew it chased away the Morlocks

1502
02:03:24,159 --> 02:03:26,920
and the shadows.

1503
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:29,570
I bent down and lifted her.

1504
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:35,510
The wood behind us seemed full of the movement
and voices of the Morlocks.

1505
02:03:35,510 --> 02:03:38,969
'She seemed to have fainted.

1506
02:03:38,969 --> 02:03:43,349
I put her carefully on my shoulder and stood
up.

1507
02:03:43,349 --> 02:03:46,520
and then there came a horrible thought.

1508
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:52,469
While lighting my match and helping Weena,
I had turned myself around several times and

1509
02:03:52,469 --> 02:03:57,800
now I had no idea which direction to go in.

1510
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:00,910
I might be facing back towards the Green Palace.

1511
02:04:00,910 --> 02:04:05,090
'Now I was cold with fear.

1512
02:04:05,090 --> 02:04:07,200
I had to think quickly what to do.

1513
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:12,020
I decided to build a fire and stay where we
were.

1514
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:16,250
I put Weena, still not moving, down against
a tree.

1515
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:22,760
Very quickly, because my candle was burning
low, I began collecting sticks and leaves.

1516
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:29,570
Here and there, out of the darkness around
me, the Morlocks' eyes shone like jewels.

1517
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:34,099
'The candle burned down and went out.

1518
02:04:34,099 --> 02:04:40,930
I lit a match and as I did so, I saw two white
shapes that were moving towards Weena.

1519
02:04:40,930 --> 02:04:45,190
When the light shone, they ran quickly to
get away.

1520
02:04:45,190 --> 02:04:50,140
One was so blinded by the light that he came
straight towards me and I felt a bone break

1521
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:52,540
when I hit him with my hand.

1522
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:58,410
He cried out in pain, walked with difficulty
for a short distance and fell down.

1523
02:04:58,410 --> 02:05:03,469
I lit another candle and continued building
my fire.

1524
02:05:03,469 --> 02:05:10,770
'After some time, I noticed how dry some of
the leaves were above me; since my arrival

1525
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:14,630
a week before, no rain had fallen.

1526
02:05:14,630 --> 02:05:20,000
So instead of looking around among the trees
for fallen sticks, I began jumping up and

1527
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,320
pulling down branches.

1528
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:30,430
Very soon I had a smoky fire of green wood
and dry sticks, and could put out my candle.

1529
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:35,389
Then I turned to the place where Weena sat
beside my metal bar.

1530
02:05:35,389 --> 02:05:41,610
I did what I could to make her wake up, but
she seemed almost dead.

1531
02:05:41,610 --> 02:05:45,370
I couldn't even decide whether or not she
was breathing.

1532
02:05:45,370 --> 02:05:54,469
'Now the smoke of the fire surrounded me and
suddenly I felt terribly tired.

1533
02:05:54,469 --> 02:06:00,699
My fire wouldn't need any more wood for an
hour or two, so I sat down.

1534
02:06:00,699 --> 02:06:05,679
The wood was full of quiet noises that I couldn't
understand.

1535
02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:09,070
I seemed just to close my eyes for a minute.

1536
02:06:09,070 --> 02:06:14,640
But then everything was dark and the Morlocks
had their hands on me.

1537
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:20,020
'Throwing off their fingers, I quickly felt
in my pocket for the matchbox and - it had

1538
02:06:20,020 --> 02:06:21,020
gone!

1539
02:06:21,020 --> 02:06:23,570
Then they took hold of me again.

1540
02:06:23,570 --> 02:06:26,949
In a moment I realised what had happened.

1541
02:06:26,949 --> 02:06:30,579
I had slept and my fire had gone out.

1542
02:06:30,579 --> 02:06:33,630
I felt the fear of death.

1543
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:36,610
The forest seemed full of the smell of burning
wood.

1544
02:06:36,610 --> 02:06:43,490
I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by
the arms, and pulled down.

1545
02:06:43,490 --> 02:06:49,199
It was unbelievably horrible in the darkness
to feel all these soft creatures lying on

1546
02:06:49,199 --> 02:06:50,750
top of me.

1547
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:54,389
There were too many of them, and I fell to
the ground.

1548
02:06:54,389 --> 02:06:58,180
'I felt little teeth biting at my neck.

1549
02:06:58,180 --> 02:07:04,770
I turned over and as I did so, my hand touched
my metal bar.

1550
02:07:04,770 --> 02:07:06,750
It gave me strength.

1551
02:07:06,750 --> 02:07:12,230
I fought hard to get back on my feet, shaking
off the human rats.

1552
02:07:12,230 --> 02:07:17,430
Holding the bar against my body, I pushed
where I thought their faces might be.

1553
02:07:17,430 --> 02:07:23,369
I could feel the softness of bodies and my
hits, and for a moment I was free.

1554
02:07:23,369 --> 02:07:29,199
'I felt the strange happiness that so often
seems to come with hard fighting.

1555
02:07:29,199 --> 02:07:36,409
I knew that both I and Weena were finished,
but I decided to make the Morlocks pay for

1556
02:07:36,409 --> 02:07:37,739
their meat.

1557
02:07:37,739 --> 02:07:43,300
I stood with my back to a tree, moving the
metal bar from side to side in front of me.

1558
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:49,869
'The whole wood was full of the movement and
cries of the Morlocks.

1559
02:07:49,869 --> 02:07:51,159
A minute passed.

1560
02:07:51,159 --> 02:07:57,790
Their voices seemed to rise to a greater level
of excitement and their movements grew faster.

1561
02:07:57,790 --> 02:08:00,880
But no more came within reach.

1562
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:04,710
I stood staring into the blackness.

1563
02:08:04,710 --> 02:08:09,590
'Then suddenly hope came.

1564
02:08:09,590 --> 02:08:11,989
Were the Morlocks afraid?

1565
02:08:11,989 --> 02:08:15,900
And soon after that, I noticed a strange thing.

1566
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:19,000
The darkness seemed to grow lighter.

1567
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:24,050
I began to see the Morlocks around me - three
half-dead at my feet.

1568
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:29,699
Then I recognised, with great surprise, that
the others were running from behind me and

1569
02:08:29,699 --> 02:08:32,500
away through the wood in front.

1570
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:36,460
And their backs seemed 110 longer white, but
reddish.

1571
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:42,579
'As I stood there, my mouth open in surprise,
I saw a little cloud of smoke move across

1572
02:08:42,579 --> 02:08:46,679
a small area of starlight between the branches
and disappear.

1573
02:08:46,679 --> 02:08:55,080
And then I understood the smell of burning
wood and the quiet voices growing now into

1574
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:56,610
a great noise.

1575
02:08:56,610 --> 02:09:02,460
I understood the smoke and the reason for
the Morlocks' speed.

1576
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:07,719
'Stepping out from behind my tree and looking
back, I saw, through the nearer trees, the

1577
02:09:07,719 --> 02:09:09,590
flames of the burning forest.

1578
02:09:09,590 --> 02:09:13,960
It was my first fire coming after me.

1579
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:17,520
I looked for Weena, but she was gone.

1580
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:23,409
The sounds of the fire behind me, the crashing
noise as each new tree caught fire, left little

1581
02:09:23,409 --> 02:09:25,099
time to think.

1582
02:09:25,099 --> 02:09:30,179
With my metal bar still in my hand, I followed
in the Morlocks' path.

1583
02:09:30,179 --> 02:09:32,869
'It was a hard race.

1584
02:09:32,869 --> 02:09:38,059
Once the flames moved forwards so quickly
on my right as I ran that they got ahead of

1585
02:09:38,059 --> 02:09:40,619
me and I had to move away to my left.

1586
02:09:40,619 --> 02:09:48,429
But at last I came out of the trees into a
small open space, and as I did so, a Morlock

1587
02:09:48,429 --> 02:09:50,290
rushed towards me.

1588
02:09:50,290 --> 02:09:54,500
He ran blindly past me and straight into the
fire!

1589
02:09:54,500 --> 02:10:04,170
'And then I saw the most strange and horrible
thing, I think, of all that I saw in that

1590
02:10:04,170 --> 02:10:05,920
future age.

1591
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:11,909
This whole space was as bright as day with
the light of the fire.

1592
02:10:11,909 --> 02:10:17,429
In the centre was a small hill, surrounded
by burned bushes.

1593
02:10:17,429 --> 02:10:23,040
Beyond that was another arm of the burning
forest, with yellow tongues of flame already

1594
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:29,090
coming from it, completely surrounding the
space with a ring of fire.

1595
02:10:29,090 --> 02:10:35,750
On the hillside were thirty or forty Morlocks,
blinded by the light and the heat, running

1596
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:38,560
here and there against each other in their
fear.

1597
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:44,821
'At first I didn't understand their blindness
and struck angrily at them with my bar, in

1598
02:10:44,821 --> 02:10:47,420
terror, as they came close to me.

1599
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:50,699
I killed one and hurt another.

1600
02:10:50,699 --> 02:10:55,900
But when I had watched the movements of one
of them under the bushes against the red sky,

1601
02:10:55,900 --> 02:11:02,570
and heard their cries, I understood their
total helplessness and pain in the strong

1602
02:11:02,570 --> 02:11:07,000
light and I hit no more of them.

1603
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:12,660
'But now and then one ran straight towards
me, frightening me so much that I got out

1604
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:14,260
of his way.

1605
02:11:14,260 --> 02:11:19,719
At one time the flames became a little less
bright and I was afraid the awful creatures

1606
02:11:19,719 --> 02:11:21,849
would be able to see me.

1607
02:11:21,849 --> 02:11:26,929
I was even thinking of beginning the fight
by killing some of them before this happened,

1608
02:11:26,929 --> 02:11:31,900
but the fire started up again and I stopped
myself.

1609
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:37,231
I walked around the hill among them and kept
out of their way, looking for a sign of Weena.

1610
02:11:37,231 --> 02:11:40,199
But Weena was gone.

1611
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:48,900
'At last I sat down on the top of the little
hill and watched this strange group of blind

1612
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:52,579
creatures feeling their way here and there.

1613
02:11:52,579 --> 02:12:00,570
They made inhuman noises to each other, as
the heat from the fire affected them.

1614
02:12:00,570 --> 02:12:06,329
The smoke rushed up and blew across the sky,
and through the occasional spaces in it, the

1615
02:12:06,329 --> 02:12:08,410
little stars shone.

1616
02:12:08,410 --> 02:12:16,699
Two or three Morlocks ran into me and I fought
them off with my hands, shaking as I did so.

1617
02:12:16,699 --> 02:12:21,949
'For most of that night I felt that I was
having a bad dream.

1618
02:12:21,949 --> 02:12:26,680
I bit myself and screamed to make myself wake
up.

1619
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:31,610
I hit the ground with my hands and got up
and sat down again.

1620
02:12:31,610 --> 02:12:34,570
I walked around, and again sat down.

1621
02:12:34,570 --> 02:12:39,480
Then I started calling to God to let me wake.

1622
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:47,090
'Three times I saw Morlocks put their heads
down in great pain and rush into the flames.

1623
02:12:47,090 --> 02:12:54,510
But at last, above the dying red of the fire,
above the great clouds of black smoke and

1624
02:12:54,510 --> 02:13:01,030
the whitening and blackening trees, and the
decreasing numbers of Morlocks, came the white

1625
02:13:01,030 --> 02:13:03,410
light of the day.

1626
02:13:03,410 --> 02:13:08,710
'I looked again for signs of Weena, but there
were none.

1627
02:13:08,710 --> 02:13:14,040
It was clear that they had left her poor little
body in the burning forest.

1628
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:18,790
I can't describe how glad I was that it hadn't
been eaten.

1629
02:13:18,790 --> 02:13:25,620
As I thought of that, I wanted to kill the
helpless Morlocks around me, but I managed

1630
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:27,449
to control myself.

1631
02:13:27,449 --> 02:13:34,260
'The hill, as I have said, was a kind of island
in the forest.

1632
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:39,900
From the top of it, I could now see the Green
Palace through the thin smoke, and from that

1633
02:13:39,900 --> 02:13:42,780
I could work out my direction to the white
sphinx.

1634
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:50,300
And so, leaving the last of the Morlocks running
and crying, I tied some grass around my feet

1635
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:57,599
and limped across smoking grass and burnt
wood, still hot inside, towards the hiding-place

1636
02:13:57,599 --> 02:13:59,889
of the Time Machine.

1637
02:13:59,889 --> 02:14:07,350
'I walked slowly, because I was very tired
and my feet were painful.

1638
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:10,770
I was so sorry about the death of little Weena.

1639
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:14,710
It seemed such a terrible thing.

1640
02:14:14,710 --> 02:14:22,760
Now, back in my own room, it feels more like
the sadness of a dream than a real sadness.

1641
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:30,790
But that morning I felt very lonely again
- terribly alone.

1642
02:14:30,790 --> 02:14:41,579
I began to think of this house, of this fireside,
of some of you, and with these thoughts came

1643
02:14:41,579 --> 02:14:43,880
a great need to return.

1644
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:53,829
'But as I walked over the smoking ground under
the bright morning sky, I made a discovery.

1645
02:14:53,829 --> 02:14:57,650
In my trouser pocket there were soil some
loose matches.

1646
02:14:57,650 --> 02:15:04,890
The box had broken open before it was lost.

1647
02:15:04,890 --> 02:15:05,890
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1648
02:15:05,890 --> 02:15:08,849
A Fight for the Time Machine

1649
02:15:08,849 --> 02:15:17,010
'At about eight or nine in the morning I came
to the same seat of yellow metal from which

1650
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:21,119
I had looked at the world on the evening of
my arrival.

1651
02:15:21,119 --> 02:15:28,739
I thought of my first ideas about this future
world on that evening, and I couldn't stop

1652
02:15:28,739 --> 02:15:31,599
myself laughing at my confidence.

1653
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:38,020
'I was sad to think how short the dream of
human intelligence had been.

1654
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:43,940
It had tried to make a comfortable, fair and
safe society.

1655
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:49,040
It had succeeded - and had then led to this.

1656
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:58,320
We forget the law of nature - that change,
danger and trouble make us think harder.

1657
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:04,360
Nature never asks the brain to work until
habit and feeling are- useless.

1658
02:16:04,360 --> 02:16:11,309
There is no intelligence where there is no
change and no need of change.

1659
02:16:11,309 --> 02:16:19,000
'So as I see it, the Upper-world people had
moved towards their weak prettiness, and the

1660
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,809
Under-world to hard work.

1661
02:16:22,809 --> 02:16:30,750
But it seemed that as time passed, the Upper-world
had stopped feeding the Under-world.

1662
02:16:30,750 --> 02:16:35,830
And when other meat failed them, the people
of the Under-world had started to eat what

1663
02:16:35,830 --> 02:16:39,450
hadn't been allowed before.

1664
02:16:39,450 --> 02:16:47,439
That is how I understood the situation in
my last view of the world of 802,701.

1665
02:16:47,439 --> 02:16:59,040
'Although I was unhappy, this seat, the peaceful
view and the warm sunlight were very pleasant

1666
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:04,780
after the hard work, excitement and terror
of the past few days.

1667
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:13,570
I was very tired and sleepy, and so I spread
myself out on the grass and slept.

1668
02:17:13,570 --> 02:17:21,010
'I woke up a little before sunset and stretching
myself, I walked down the hill towards the

1669
02:17:21,010 --> 02:17:23,160
white sphinx.

1670
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:26,340
And now a most unexpected thing happened.

1671
02:17:26,340 --> 02:17:33,040
As I came to the pedestal, I found that the
metal doors were open.

1672
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:37,380
I stopped in front of them, not sure about
entering.

1673
02:17:37,380 --> 02:17:47,210
Inside was a small room, and on a higher place
in the corner of this was the Time Machine.

1674
02:17:47,210 --> 02:17:49,500
I had the small levers in my pocket.

1675
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:56,809
So here, after all my thought about breaking
in, was an easy solution.

1676
02:17:56,809 --> 02:18:01,030
I threw my metal bar away, almost sorry not
to use it.

1677
02:18:01,030 --> 02:18:05,900
'A sudden thought came into my head as I bent
towards the door.

1678
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:11,580
This time, at least, I understood the thinking
of the Morlocks.

1679
02:18:11,580 --> 02:18:18,179
Trying not to laugh, I stepped through the
door and up to the Time Machine.

1680
02:18:18,179 --> 02:18:23,349
I was surprised to find it had been carefully
oiled and cleaned.

1681
02:18:23,349 --> 02:18:30,120
I have thought since then that the Morlocks
had even partly taken it to pieces while trying

1682
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:34,380
in their slow way to understand it.

1683
02:18:34,380 --> 02:18:40,910
'Now as I stood and examined it, finding pleasure
in just touching it, it happened.

1684
02:18:40,910 --> 02:18:43,830
I had expected it.

1685
02:18:43,830 --> 02:18:49,290
The metal panels suddenly closed with a loud
noise.

1686
02:18:49,290 --> 02:18:54,700
I was in the dark and couldn't get out.

1687
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:57,559
This is what the Morlocks thought, I was certain.

1688
02:18:57,559 --> 02:18:59,750
I smiled.

1689
02:18:59,750 --> 02:19:07,440
'I could already hear them laughing softly
as they came towards me.

1690
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:11,490
Very calmly I tried to strike a match.

1691
02:19:11,490 --> 02:19:17,399
I only had to fix the levers and leave then
like a ghost.

1692
02:19:17,399 --> 02:19:19,870
But i had forgotten one little thing.

1693
02:19:19,870 --> 02:19:24,500
Those matches could only be lit by striking
them against the box.

1694
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:28,650
'You can imagine how all my calm disappeared.

1695
02:19:28,650 --> 02:19:30,810
The little creatures were close to me.

1696
02:19:30,810 --> 02:19:32,340
One touched me.

1697
02:19:32,340 --> 02:19:36,639
I struck at them with the levers and began
to get into the seat of the machine.

1698
02:19:36,639 --> 02:19:40,910
Then one hand touched me and then another.

1699
02:19:40,910 --> 02:19:46,250
After that I simply had to fight against their
fingers for my levers and at the same time

1700
02:19:46,250 --> 02:19:48,640
feel for the places where these fitted.

1701
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:52,899
'One lever, in fact, almost got away from
me.

1702
02:19:52,899 --> 02:19:58,760
As it left my hand, I had to hit in the dark
with my head - I could hear the Morlocks head

1703
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:00,920
ring - to get it back.

1704
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:05,430
This was an even more dangerous fight than
the fight in the forest, I think.

1705
02:20:05,430 --> 02:20:10,150
'But at last the lever was fixed and I pulled
it.

1706
02:20:10,150 --> 02:20:13,580
The little hands fell away from me.

1707
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:21,690
The darkness soon changed to the same grey
light that I have already described.

1708
02:20:21,690 --> 02:20:25,850
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1709
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:27,261
The Death of the World

1710
02:20:27,261 --> 02:20:36,860
'I have already told you of the sickness and
confusion that comes with time travelling.

1711
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:41,110
And this time I wasn't sitting safely in the
seat.

1712
02:20:41,110 --> 02:20:46,710
For some time I held onto the machine as it
moved from side to side, not thinking about

1713
02:20:46,710 --> 02:20:48,280
my journey.

1714
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:55,020
'When I looked at the dials again I was very
surprised to find where I had arrived.

1715
02:20:55,020 --> 02:21:01,960
One dial shows days, another thousands of
days, another millions of days, and another

1716
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:03,720
thousands of millions.

1717
02:21:03,720 --> 02:21:10,370
Instead of pushing the levers backwards, I
had pulled them forwards, and when I looked

1718
02:21:10,370 --> 02:21:16,320
at the dials I found that the thousands hand
was moving round as fast as the seconds hand

1719
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:19,149
of a watch - into the future.

1720
02:21:19,149 --> 02:21:25,590
'As I continued travelling, the appearance
of things changed in a strange way.

1721
02:21:25,590 --> 02:21:30,320
First the greyness grew darker.

1722
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:35,160
Then the times of each day and night grew
longer and longer.

1723
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:41,450
At first this seemed strange because I was
still travelling at high speed.

1724
02:21:41,450 --> 02:21:49,230
But then I understood that the world had slowed
down, and now each movement of the sun across

1725
02:21:49,230 --> 02:21:53,819
the sky lasted for years.

1726
02:21:53,819 --> 02:21:59,170
'At last an unchanging half-light covered
the world.

1727
02:21:59,170 --> 02:22:06,830
The sun's line of light had disappeared, because
it simply came up and went down in the west

1728
02:22:06,830 --> 02:22:10,190
and grew wider and redder.

1729
02:22:10,190 --> 02:22:13,319
The moon had totally disappeared.

1730
02:22:13,319 --> 02:22:18,820
The movement of the stars had grown slower
and slower.

1731
02:22:18,820 --> 02:22:27,490
Finally, some time before I stopped, a large,
red sun stopped moving.

1732
02:22:27,490 --> 02:22:34,190
At one time it had become brighter for a short
time, but it quickly lost its light again.

1733
02:22:34,190 --> 02:22:42,840
'I understood that the Earth had stopped turning
and was resting with one side facing the sun,

1734
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:46,620
just as in our own time the moon faces the
Earth.

1735
02:22:46,620 --> 02:22:54,050
Very nervously, because I remembered my first
fall, I began to slow the machine down.

1736
02:22:54,050 --> 02:23:02,580
The hands on the dials moved slower and slower
until the thousands dial seemed to stop and

1737
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:05,450
the daily one could be seen again.

1738
02:23:05,450 --> 02:23:10,640
I slowed down more, until I could begin to
see an empty beach.

1739
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:18,109
'I stopped very gently and sat in the Time
Machine, looking round.

1740
02:23:18,109 --> 02:23:22,580
The sky was no longer blue.

1741
02:23:22,580 --> 02:23:30,200
To the north-east it was inky black, and out
of the darkness the pale white stars shone

1742
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:32,990
clearly and brightly.

1743
02:23:32,990 --> 02:23:40,660
Overhead it was deep red and starless, and
to the south-east it grew brighter to the

1744
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:45,380
point where half of the sun could be seen
above the line of the land.

1745
02:23:45,380 --> 02:23:51,790
The rocks around me were of a dull reddish
colour.

1746
02:23:51,790 --> 02:23:56,920
Some very green plants covered every part
of their south-eastern side, and these were

1747
02:23:56,920 --> 02:23:59,510
the only living things that I could see.

1748
02:23:59,510 --> 02:24:03,580
'The machine was standing on a beach.

1749
02:24:03,580 --> 02:24:05,500
The sea was to the south-west.

1750
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:10,290
There were no waves, because there was no
wind.

1751
02:24:10,290 --> 02:24:16,040
The sea moved very slowly up and down like
gentle breathing.

1752
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:22,220
And along the edge of the water was a thick
line of salt - pink against the brightly-coloured

1753
02:24:22,220 --> 02:24:24,380
sky.

1754
02:24:24,380 --> 02:24:28,359
I noticed that I was breathing very fist.

1755
02:24:28,359 --> 02:24:33,279
This reminded me of my only experience of
climbing mountains, and I knew that the air

1756
02:24:33,279 --> 02:24:36,510
was thinner than it is now.

1757
02:24:36,510 --> 02:24:44,370
'Far away up the empty beach I heard a scream
and saw a thing like an enormous insect go

1758
02:24:44,370 --> 02:24:47,200
flying up into the sky.

1759
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:52,540
It circled and disappeared over some low hills
beyond.

1760
02:24:52,540 --> 02:25:01,010
The sound of its voice was so sad that I shook
and sat myself more safely on the machine.

1761
02:25:01,010 --> 02:25:09,070
'Looking round me again, I saw that, quite
near, a large red rock - I had thought it

1762
02:25:09,070 --> 02:25:13,500
was a rock - was moving slowly towards me.

1763
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:20,600
Then I saw that the thing was really a large
crab-like creature.

1764
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:29,620
Can you imagine a crab as large as that table,
with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly

1765
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:31,890
and its eyes looking at you?

1766
02:25:31,890 --> 02:25:38,480
'As I stared at this horrible creature, I
felt something on my face.

1767
02:25:38,480 --> 02:25:43,500
I tried to brush it away with my hand, but
in a moment it returned and almost immediately

1768
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:45,779
I felt another by my ear.

1769
02:25:45,779 --> 02:25:50,010
I struck at this and found something like
a long string.

1770
02:25:50,010 --> 02:25:52,050
It was pulled quickly out of my hand.

1771
02:25:52,050 --> 02:25:59,420
With a great feeling of fear, I turned and
saw that another enormous crab was standing

1772
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:01,370
just behind me.

1773
02:26:01,370 --> 02:26:06,580
Its horrible eyes were moving, its mouth was
open with hunger and it was going to attack

1774
02:26:06,580 --> 02:26:07,580
me.

1775
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:14,840
'In a moment my hand was on the lever and
I had put a month between myself and these

1776
02:26:14,840 --> 02:26:17,120
creatures.

1777
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:23,370
But I was still on the same beach and I saw
them clearly now when I stopped.

1778
02:26:23,370 --> 02:26:28,750
Large numbers of them seemed to be moving
here and there, in the dull light, among the

1779
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:31,149
strong green plants.

1780
02:26:31,149 --> 02:26:40,790
'I can't make you understand the feeling of
great emptiness that hung over the world.

1781
02:26:40,790 --> 02:26:50,680
The red eastern sky, the darkness to the north,
the salt Dead Sea, the thin air, all had a

1782
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:53,210
horrible effect.

1783
02:26:53,210 --> 02:27:01,540
I moved a hundred years further into the future,
and there was the same red sun - a little

1784
02:27:01,540 --> 02:27:10,540
larger, a little darker - the same dying sea,
the same cold air, and the same crowd of crabs

1785
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:15,910
moving slowly in and out of the green plants
and the red rocks.

1786
02:27:15,910 --> 02:27:23,240
And in the west I saw a curved pale line like
a large new moon.

1787
02:27:23,240 --> 02:27:31,260
'So I travelled, stopping now and again, in
great steps of a thousand years or more, wanting

1788
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:35,180
to know what happened to the Earth.

1789
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:44,080
I watched, with a strange interest, the sun
grow larger and duller in the western sky,

1790
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:47,740
and the life of the old Earth die away.

1791
02:27:47,740 --> 02:27:57,189
At last, more than thirty million years from
now, the enormous red sun covered almost a

1792
02:27:57,189 --> 02:27:59,590
tenth of the darkening sky.

1793
02:27:59,590 --> 02:28:04,840
'Then I stopped again and the hundreds of
crabs had disappeared.

1794
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:11,430
Now the red beach, except for its green plants,
seemed lifeless.

1795
02:28:11,430 --> 02:28:18,279
A strong cold attacked me and snow fell from
time to time.

1796
02:28:18,279 --> 02:28:23,760
There was ice along the edge of the sea, with
large pieces further out, but most of that

1797
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:29,311
salt ocean - all bloody under the sky - was
still unfrozen.

1798
02:28:29,311 --> 02:28:37,170
'I looked around me to see if any animals
were still alive, but I saw nothing moving,

1799
02:28:37,170 --> 02:28:42,450
on the land or in the sky or sea.

1800
02:28:42,450 --> 02:28:48,910
A low island of sand had appeared in the sea
and the water had moved back from the beach.

1801
02:28:48,910 --> 02:28:56,470
I thought I saw a black object moving around
on this, but it stopped moving when I looked

1802
02:28:56,470 --> 02:29:01,060
at it, and I decided that it was just a rock.

1803
02:29:01,060 --> 02:29:04,330
The stars in the sky were very bright.

1804
02:29:04,330 --> 02:29:11,220
'Suddenly I noticed that the shape of the
sun in the west had changed and that something

1805
02:29:11,220 --> 02:29:14,630
was moving into its circle.

1806
02:29:14,630 --> 02:29:21,500
For a minute, perhaps, I stared in shock at
this and then I realised that either the moon

1807
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:25,490
or Mercury was passing across the sun.

1808
02:29:25,490 --> 02:29:33,310
'It became darker and darker, a cold wind
began to blow from the east and the snow fell

1809
02:29:33,310 --> 02:29:36,200
more and more heavily.

1810
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:41,850
Except for these lifeless sounds the world
was silent.

1811
02:29:41,850 --> 02:29:43,880
Silent?

1812
02:29:43,880 --> 02:29:48,080
It would be hard to describe the quietness
of it all.

1813
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:58,420
All the everyday sounds of people, and of
sheep, birds and insects - all that had ended.

1814
02:29:58,420 --> 02:30:04,490
As the darkness grew, the snow fell more heavily
and it turned colder.

1815
02:30:04,490 --> 02:30:07,520
The soft wind grew stronger.

1816
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:12,920
In another moment only the pale stars could
be seen.

1817
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:17,189
Everything else was darkness.

1818
02:30:17,189 --> 02:30:20,830
The sky was completely black.

1819
02:30:20,830 --> 02:30:25,660
'This great darkness was horrible to me.

1820
02:30:25,660 --> 02:30:29,330
I shook, and began to feel very sick.

1821
02:30:29,330 --> 02:30:35,399
Then, like a red-hot curve in the sky, the
edge of the sun appeared.

1822
02:30:35,399 --> 02:30:38,240
I got off the machine to recover.

1823
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:41,970
I felt unable to face the return journey.

1824
02:30:41,970 --> 02:30:50,700
As I stood there, I saw again the moving thing
on the island - there was no mistake now that

1825
02:30:50,700 --> 02:30:56,200
it was a moving thing - against the red water
of the sea.

1826
02:30:56,200 --> 02:31:05,000
It was round, the size of a football perhaps,
and long arms hung down from it.

1827
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,990
'Then I felt that I was fainting.

1828
02:31:07,990 --> 02:31:14,880
But a terrible fear of lying helpless in that
awful half-darkness gave me strength while

1829
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:20,601
I climbed back into the seat.

1830
02:31:20,601 --> 02:31:23,270
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1831
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:24,270
Coming Home

1832
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:29,170
'So I came back.

1833
02:31:29,170 --> 02:31:31,120
I think I fainted in the machine.

1834
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:38,950
When I felt better the change from day to
night had started again, the sun was golden

1835
02:31:38,950 --> 02:31:41,450
and the sky was blue.

1836
02:31:41,450 --> 02:31:44,340
I breathed more freely.

1837
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:47,910
The shape of the land moved here and there.

1838
02:31:47,910 --> 02:31:53,850
At last I saw again the shadows of houses,
the signs of humans.

1839
02:31:53,850 --> 02:32:00,529
These, too, changed and passed, and others
came.

1840
02:32:00,529 --> 02:32:06,180
Soon I began to recognise our own smaller
and familiar buildings, and the hand of the

1841
02:32:06,180 --> 02:32:10,630
thousands dial returned to its starting point.

1842
02:32:10,630 --> 02:32:16,360
Then the old walls of the laboratory came
round me.

1843
02:32:16,360 --> 02:32:20,880
Very gently now, I slowed the machine down.

1844
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:28,540
'I think I have told you that when I started,
before my speed became very high, Mrs Watchett,

1845
02:32:28,540 --> 02:32:31,990
my cook, had walked across the room.

1846
02:32:31,990 --> 02:32:36,610
She moved, as it seemed to me, very quickly.

1847
02:32:36,610 --> 02:32:43,540
As I returned, I passed again across that
minute and now all her movements appeared

1848
02:32:43,540 --> 02:32:49,380
to be the exact opposite of the ones she had
made before.

1849
02:32:49,380 --> 02:32:57,380
And just before that, I seemed to see you,
Hillyer, for a moment.'

1850
02:32:57,380 --> 02:33:00,240
The Time Traveller looked at me as he spoke.

1851
02:33:00,240 --> 02:33:09,170
'Then I stopped the machine, got off" it very
shakily and sat down on my chair.

1852
02:33:09,170 --> 02:33:13,390
For several minutes I shook violently.

1853
02:33:13,390 --> 02:33:16,210
Then I became calmer.

1854
02:33:16,210 --> 02:33:21,700
Around me was my old laboratory again, exactly
as it had been.

1855
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:24,810
But not exactly!

1856
02:33:24,810 --> 02:33:29,390
The machine had started from the south-east
corner.

1857
02:33:29,390 --> 02:33:33,240
It had stopped again in the north-west.

1858
02:33:33,240 --> 02:33:42,830
This gives you the exact distance from my
little lawn to the pedestal of the white sphinx

1859
02:33:42,830 --> 02:33:45,830
into which the Morlocks had carried it.

1860
02:33:45,830 --> 02:33:51,610
'For a time my brain went dead.

1861
02:33:51,610 --> 02:33:58,380
Then I got up and came through here, limping
because my heel was still painful.

1862
02:33:58,380 --> 02:34:02,340
I saw the newspaper on the table by the door.

1863
02:34:02,340 --> 02:34:09,000
I found the date really was today and, looking
at the clock, I saw that the time was almost

1864
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,450
eight o'clock.

1865
02:34:11,450 --> 02:34:15,660
I heard your voices and the sound of plates.

1866
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:21,270
I smelled well-cooked meat and opened the
door to the dining- room.

1867
02:34:21,270 --> 02:34:25,920
You know the rest.'

1868
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:27,960
He looked at the Medical Man.

1869
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:29,200
'No.

1870
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:34,000
I can't expect you to believe it.

1871
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:38,540
Accept it as a lie - or as a guess at the
future.

1872
02:34:38,540 --> 02:34:41,740
Say I dreamed it in the laboratory.

1873
02:34:41,740 --> 02:34:48,580
But as a story, what do you think of it?'

1874
02:34:48,580 --> 02:34:55,580
He picked up his pipe and began, in his usual
way, to play with it in his hands.

1875
02:34:55,580 --> 02:35:00,189
I took my eyes off his face and looked around
at the others.

1876
02:35:00,189 --> 02:35:04,660
The Medical Man was staring at our host.

1877
02:35:04,660 --> 02:35:10,330
The Editor was looking hard at the end of
his cigarette - his sixth.

1878
02:35:10,330 --> 02:35:14,850
The Journalist searched in his pocket for
his watch.

1879
02:35:14,850 --> 02:35:20,660
The others, as I remember, did not move.

1880
02:35:20,660 --> 02:35:22,570
The Editor stood up and shook his head.

1881
02:35:22,570 --> 02:35:28,210
'What a pity that you are not a writer of
stories!' he said, putting his hand on the

1882
02:35:28,210 --> 02:35:30,630
Time Traveller's shoulder.

1883
02:35:30,630 --> 02:35:33,170
'You don't believe it?'

1884
02:35:33,170 --> 02:35:34,189
'Well-'

1885
02:35:34,189 --> 02:35:37,120
'I thought not.'

1886
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:40,170
The Time Traveller turned to us.

1887
02:35:40,170 --> 02:35:43,620
'Where are the matches?' he said.

1888
02:35:43,620 --> 02:35:47,880
He lit his pipe, blowing smoke.

1889
02:35:47,880 --> 02:35:52,450
'To tell you the truth, I can't really believe
it myself...

1890
02:35:52,450 --> 02:35:55,740
But...'

1891
02:35:55,740 --> 02:36:03,779
His eye fell with a questioning look on the
dead white flowers on the little table.

1892
02:36:03,779 --> 02:36:08,530
Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe.

1893
02:36:08,530 --> 02:36:12,790
I saw he was looking at some red marks.

1894
02:36:12,790 --> 02:36:18,040
The Medical Man rose, came to the lamp and
examined the flowers.

1895
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:22,890
'This one is odd,' he said.

1896
02:36:22,890 --> 02:36:27,830
The Psychologist bent forwards to see, holding
out his hand for one of them.

1897
02:36:27,830 --> 02:36:35,040
'It's strange,' said the Medical Man, 'but
I certainly don't know what type of flowers

1898
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:36,340
these are.

1899
02:36:36,340 --> 02:36:39,710
Can I have them?'

1900
02:36:39,710 --> 02:36:42,690
The Time Traveller thought for a few seconds.

1901
02:36:42,690 --> 02:36:45,560
Then he suddenly said,' Certainly not.'

1902
02:36:45,560 --> 02:36:50,360
'Where did you really get them?' said the
Medical Man.

1903
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:53,380
The Time Traveller put his hand to his head.

1904
02:36:53,380 --> 02:36:56,810
I thought he was trying to remember something.

1905
02:36:56,810 --> 02:37:02,950
'They were put into my pocket by Weena.'

1906
02:37:02,950 --> 02:37:06,410
He stared round the room.

1907
02:37:06,410 --> 02:37:09,540
'I'm beginning to forget it all.

1908
02:37:09,540 --> 02:37:16,370
Did I ever make a Time Machine, or a model
of a Time Machine?

1909
02:37:16,370 --> 02:37:18,610
Or is it only a dream?

1910
02:37:18,610 --> 02:37:21,220
I must look at that machine.

1911
02:37:21,220 --> 02:37:23,300
If there is one!'

1912
02:37:23,300 --> 02:37:27,200
He picked up the lamp quickly and carried
it through the door.

1913
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:29,180
We followed him.

1914
02:37:29,180 --> 02:37:36,770
There in the lamplight was the machine, with
brown spots and mud on it, bits of grass on

1915
02:37:36,770 --> 02:37:40,420
the lower parts and one side bent.

1916
02:37:40,420 --> 02:37:46,990
The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the
table and touched the damaged side.

1917
02:37:46,990 --> 02:37:50,880
'It's all right now,' he said.

1918
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:53,570
'My story was true.

1919
02:37:53,570 --> 02:37:58,600
I am sorry I brought you out here in the cold.'

1920
02:37:58,600 --> 02:38:05,319
He picked up the lamp and in total silence
we returned to the smoking room.

1921
02:38:05,319 --> 02:38:11,160
He came into the hall with us and helped the
Editor on with his coat.

1922
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:16,680
The Medical Man looked into his face and,
after a few seconds, told him he was suffering

1923
02:38:16,680 --> 02:38:18,771
from too much work.

1924
02:38:18,771 --> 02:38:22,540
The Time Traveller laughed loudly.

1925
02:38:22,540 --> 02:38:28,970
I remember him standing at the open door,
shouting good night.

1926
02:38:28,970 --> 02:38:32,040
I walked some distance with the Editor.

1927
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:36,680
He thought the story was 'a colourful lie'.

1928
02:38:36,680 --> 02:38:40,240
I was unable to make up my mind.

1929
02:38:40,240 --> 02:38:47,490
It was so strange, and the telling was so
believable and serious.

1930
02:38:47,490 --> 02:38:50,590
I lay awake most of the night thinking about
it.

1931
02:38:50,590 --> 02:38:56,950
The next day, I went to see the Time Traveller
again.

1932
02:38:56,950 --> 02:38:59,970
I was told he was in the laboratory.

1933
02:38:59,970 --> 02:39:04,220
I went there but it was empty.

1934
02:39:04,220 --> 02:39:11,290
I stared for a minute at the Time Machine
and put out a hand and touched the lever.

1935
02:39:11,290 --> 02:39:15,859
It shook like a branch in the wind.

1936
02:39:15,859 --> 02:39:23,661
Its movements surprised me greatly, and I
had a strange memory of childhood days, when

1937
02:39:23,661 --> 02:39:25,680
I was not allowed to touch things.

1938
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:31,620
I went back into the smoking room and found
the Time Traveller there.

1939
02:39:31,620 --> 02:39:36,580
He had a small camera under one arm and a
bag under the other.

1940
02:39:36,580 --> 02:39:38,040
He laughed when he saw me.

1941
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:42,570
'I'm very busy,' he said,' with that thing
in there.'

1942
02:39:42,570 --> 02:39:45,340
'But is it not a joke?'

1943
02:39:45,340 --> 02:39:46,340
I said.

1944
02:39:46,340 --> 02:39:51,850
'Do you really travel through time?'

1945
02:39:51,850 --> 02:39:54,940
'Really and truly I do.'

1946
02:39:54,940 --> 02:39:58,160
And he looked straight into my eyes.

1947
02:39:58,160 --> 02:40:01,500
'I only want half an hour,' he said.

1948
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:04,260
'I know why you came and it is very good of
you.

1949
02:40:04,260 --> 02:40:06,630
There are some magazines here.

1950
02:40:06,630 --> 02:40:11,090
If you will stay for lunch I shall prove this
time-travelling to you completely.

1951
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:16,330
I shall even bring back some things for you
to look at.

1952
02:40:16,330 --> 02:40:19,950
Will you forgive me if I leave you now?'

1953
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:28,170
I agreed, not really understanding the full
meaning of his words, and he left the room.

1954
02:40:28,170 --> 02:40:36,750
I heard the door of the laboratory shut, sat
down in a chair and picked up the daily paper.

1955
02:40:36,750 --> 02:40:38,270
What was he going to do before lunch-time?

1956
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:46,600
Then suddenly I was reminded by an advertisement
that I had promised to meet a friend at two.

1957
02:40:46,600 --> 02:40:50,859
I looked at my watch and saw that there was
just enough time.

1958
02:40:50,859 --> 02:40:54,540
I got up and went to tell the Time Traveller.

1959
02:40:54,540 --> 02:41:02,380
As I took hold of the handle of the laboratory
door I heard a shout, then strange noises.

1960
02:41:02,380 --> 02:41:09,700
A sudden wind blew round me as I opened the
door, and from inside came the sound of broken

1961
02:41:09,700 --> 02:41:13,069
glass falling on the floor.

1962
02:41:13,069 --> 02:41:18,450
The Time Traveller was not there.

1963
02:41:18,450 --> 02:41:25,610
I seemed to see a ghostly, unclear figure
sitting in a moving machine for a moment,

1964
02:41:25,610 --> 02:41:28,780
but all of this disappeared.

1965
02:41:28,780 --> 02:41:32,150
The Time Machine had gone.

1966
02:41:32,150 --> 02:41:35,800
The window was broken.

1967
02:41:35,800 --> 02:41:40,020
I was surprised and unable to understand.

1968
02:41:40,020 --> 02:41:46,380
As I stood staring, the door into the garden
opened and a servant appeared.

1969
02:41:46,380 --> 02:41:47,870
We looked at each other.

1970
02:41:47,870 --> 02:41:51,069
Then ideas began to come.

1971
02:41:51,069 --> 02:41:55,280
'Has Mr gone out that way?'

1972
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:56,280
I said.

1973
02:41:56,280 --> 02:41:57,950
'No, sir.

1974
02:41:57,950 --> 02:42:01,040
No one has come out this way.'

1975
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:04,350
And then I understood.

1976
02:42:04,350 --> 02:42:14,160
I stayed there, waiting for the Time Traveller;
waiting for the second, perhaps stranger story,

1977
02:42:14,160 --> 02:42:17,870
and the objects and photographs he would bring
with him.

1978
02:42:17,870 --> 02:42:23,050
But I am beginning to fear that I must wait
a lifetime.

1979
02:42:23,050 --> 02:42:30,700
The Time Traveller disappeared three years
ago.

1980
02:42:30,700 --> 02:42:35,330
And as everyone knows now, he has never returned.
