CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,720
The Girl with a Future

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:18,000
On 1 July 1961, a baby girl was born at her
family home, in Sandringham, Norfolk.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,380
Her parents, Frances and Johnnie Spencer,
couldn't decide what to call her at first.

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:33,680
They had two daughters already, and this time
they really wanted a boy.

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,660
Finally, they called her 'Diana'.

7
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:47,100
They didn't know that in the future the name
Diana Spencer would be famous all over the

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,850
world.

9
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:57,440
They could not guess how popular she would
be in her short but full life.

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,450
The Spencers are a very old English family.

11
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:10,360
They became rich a long time ago as sheep
farmers, and the family goes back to King

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,320
Charles II and King James II of England.

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,390
They have been friends and helpers of the
Royal Family for hundreds of years.

14
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:32,410
The house they lived in then, Park House,
was near the Queen's house at Sandringham,

15
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:39,159
so Diana grew up almost 'next door' to the
Royal Family.

16
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:46,190
Diana often visited them at Sandringham House
when she was a little girl.

17
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:54,979
The Queen's most important homes are at Buckingham
Palace in London, and Windsor Castle just

18
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,050
to the west of London.

19
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:06,869
But she also spends time at Balmoral Castle
in Scotland, and at Sandringham House, which

20
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,539
is in the east of England.

21
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:17,629
Later, people called Diana 'a fairy-tale princess'.

22
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:22,139
But her story was often a sad one too.

23
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:32,159
Her parents had the son that they wanted so
much in 1964 - they called him Charles.

24
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:39,690
But their marriage was unhappy, and soon terrible
fights began.

25
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:50,189
When Diana was only six, her mother, Frances,
ran away with another man, Peter Shand Kydd.

26
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:57,139
For a long time, the children could only visit
their mother at weekends.

27
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:02,170
Frances very much wanted her children to live
with her.

28
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:10,390
But their father was against the idea, and
so they stayed at Park House with him.

29
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,909
Other women came to the house to look after
the children, but they didn't usually stay

30
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:17,529
long.

31
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:23,700
The children made trouble for them - they
threw their clothes out of the window, or

32
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,090
locked them in the toilet!

33
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,680
The two smallest children, Charles and Diana,
were really unhappy.

34
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:43,439
Each night in bed, Charles cried for his mother,
and Diana lay there alone, listening to him.

35
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:51,040
She was too frightened of the dark house to
get out of bed and go to him.

36
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,359
But Diana and Charles were a loving brother
and sister.

37
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:04,749
As time went on, they often travelled by train
together to visit their mother.

38
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:12,480
Diana was always friendly with her two older
sisters, Sarah and Jane, but they had different

39
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,390
lives.

40
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:22,650
Johnnie Spencer tried to do his best for the
four children, and at Christmas they could

41
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,000
choose all the presents that they wanted.

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,569
There were too many presents, and not enough
hugs and kisses, they remembered later.

43
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:40,020
Diana loved her father, and wanted to look
after him.

44
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:46,650
She liked to help in the house too, and to
look after her animals.

45
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,569
She had a cat, Marmalade, and a dog called
Jill.

46
00:04:52,569 --> 00:05:01,409
Like a lot of English girls, Diana learned
to ride a horse, but after she broke her arm

47
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:08,810
in an accident she was frightened, and didn't
want to ride again.

48
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,170
Like the children in many rich or old families
in England, the Spencer children went away

49
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,810
to school.

50
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:26,080
Diana went to Riddlesworth Hall School in
1970 when she was only seven.

51
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:33,270
She lived there during the term, and came
home in the holidays.

52
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:42,439
In 1974, she went on to her mother's old school,
West Heath School in Kent, which was on the

53
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:45,780
other side of London from Norfolk.

54
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,870
Her sisters Sarah and Jane were also students
there.

55
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:59,569
By then, her mother wasn't living in London,
but in Scotland.

56
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:05,930
She and her husband Peter had a large farm
on an island.

57
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:14,169
It was a wild and beautiful place, and Diana
had some lovely holidays there.

58
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:22,850
In Diana's young life, everything was always
changing, and she often felt alone.

59
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:30,220
She was very sad when her grandmother - her
father s mother - died in 1972.

60
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:35,599
Her grandmother was a very kind woman.

61
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:40,320
She looked after Diana a lot when her parents
separated.

62
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:50,610
Things changed even more in 1975 when her
grandfather died too, and the Spencer family

63
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:56,150
moved into the old family home at Althorp,
in Northamptonshire.

64
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:05,710
Diana's father was now Earl Spencer, Diana
became Lady Diana Spencer, and her brother

65
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,289
Charles a Viscount.

66
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:13,699
Later, he too became an Earl.

67
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:20,440
Until then, Park House in Sandringham was
the only home that Diana knew.

68
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,240
She didn't like going to Sandringham House
to visit the royal family much - she felt

69
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,430
strange in the royal house.

70
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:35,759
But she loved Park House, with its friendly
rooms and its big garden.

71
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:43,780
She could go swimming in the pool there, play
tennis, or hide in the tree-house.

72
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,789
The children didn't really want to live at
Althorp.

73
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:53,389
They didn't enjoy their visits there when
their grandfather was alive.

74
00:07:53,389 --> 00:08:00,810
The house was large, dark and frightening,
with lots of old family pictures on the walls.

75
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,930
But as they grew up, they liked it more.

76
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:14,020
They enjoyed having their friends to stay
- it was a good house for parties!

77
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,610
At school, Diana made plenty of friends.

78
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:25,910
She was a good student, not especially clever,
but she enjoyed her lessons.

79
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:33,460
She liked English and painting, but she was
best at dancing and swimming.

80
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:41,850
It was soon clear that she would never go
to university, but she was helpful and kind.

81
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,440
She even won a cup for helpfulness!

82
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,480
As part of the school's charity programme,
Diana began to visit old or ill people in

83
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,090
the town near the school.

84
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:01,440
Usually, she talked to them, or helped with
their shopping.

85
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,000
This is perhaps where her love of charity
work began.

86
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,910
But she was not always quite so good.

87
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:17,140
Once she got into real trouble when she left
the school at night!

88
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:24,450
She planned to meet a friend outside the school
to get some sweets from her.

89
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:30,730
One of the teachers found her empty bed and
called the police!

90
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:38,890
The head teacher was very angry, but her parents
were secretly amused.

91
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:43,690
When Diana left West Heath School, she was
sixteen.

92
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,820
At first, she didn't know what to do.

93
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,300
Life at home was changing again because her
father had a new wife.

94
00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:02,090
Her name was Raine, and she was the daughter
of Barbara Cartland, a famous writer of love

95
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,180
stories.

96
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:10,510
Diana and her brother and sisters were not
very pleased about the marriage.

97
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:17,210
They didn't want Raine as their second mother,
and were always fighting with her.

98
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:22,490
But Johnnie loved his new wife, and they were
very happy together.

99
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:31,030
And, in the end, Diana was pleased that Raine
was there to look after her father.

100
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:38,600
In 1978, a year after the marriage, Johnnie
became very ill.

101
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,400
The doctors thought that he would die.

102
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:52,200
Raine nursed him back to health, but it was
a long time before he was better again.

103
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:59,660
A little earlier, in 1977, Diana went off
to a very expensive 'finishing' school in

104
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:05,420
Switzerland because she didn't want to stay
at home.

105
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:12,100
Girls from rich families went there to learn
to cook, to speak French, and to look after

106
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,300
a home.

107
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:21,520
Diana only stayed there for six weeks, then
decided that she wanted to go back to England

108
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,010
to work.

109
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:31,880
In the past, girls from important families
like the Spencers never worked for money.

110
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,860
But times were different now, and Diana wanted
to be like other girls of her age.

111
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,660
'I can easily find a job,' she told her father.

112
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:52,800
He bought her a very nice flat in Coleherne
Court, Kensington, in the centre of London.

113
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,570
She asked a few friends to come and live with
her - one of them, Carolyn Pride, was an old

114
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,290
schoolfriend of hers.

115
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,580
This was the beginning of a really happy time
for Diana.

116
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,040
She was young and pretty.

117
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:18,420
She had good friends - both boyfriends and
girlfriends - and a nice flat and a car.

118
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,950
She was free to try and find her way in the
world.

119
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,040
What could she do for a job?

120
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:34,720
She loved children, and so she began to look
after babies and small children for her sisters'

121
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,810
friends.

122
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:43,110
Sometimes she cleaned their houses too, or
cooked meals for them.

123
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:49,540
She studied cooking again in London - she
was good at Russian soup: but she and the

124
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,960
girls in the flat ate chocolate most of the
time!

125
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,000
Then she found a job at the Young England
School for little children.

126
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,950
Here she was very happy, and her bosses were
very pleased with her work.

127
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:15,110
She was calm and kind with the children, and
always gave them plenty of love and hugs.

128
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:23,540
Soon there would be love in her life too - she
would find her prince and fill in love.

129
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,090
She would become the new Princess of Wales.

130
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:34,180
She didn't know this, of course, but she did
feel that she was getting ready for something

131
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,050
special.

132
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:43,250
Diana went to parties, and she had a lot of
friends, but she was never serious about a

133
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,890
man at that time.

134
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:55,970
'I had to keep myself tidy,' she said later,
'for what was coming.'

135
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,030
CHAPTER TWO

136
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:02,000
A Fairy-Tale Wedding

137
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,070
Prince Charles was taking a long time to choose
a wife.

138
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,080
He was already 32.

139
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:17,660
He always had plenty of girlfriends - Diana's
sister, Sarah, was once his girlfriend.

140
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,880
But he couldn't decide who to marry.

141
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,530
Charles was the future King of Britain, so
he had to choose well.

142
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,380
Not every beautiful woman makes a good queen.

143
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:40,670
Life in the Royal Family can be very hard
- the 'Royals' spend a lot of time in public.

144
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:48,820
She must also be a girl from a good family,
and Charles must be her first lover.

145
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:57,290
In February 1981, the news finally came out
that Prince Charles was getting married - to

146
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,540
Lady Diana Spencer.

147
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:08,780
The photos in the newspapers showed a pretty,
quiet girl with a sweet smile, and the reporters

148
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,600
soon began to call her 'Shy Di'.

149
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:21,240
Diana was the first English girl to marry
a Prince of Wales for five hundred years.

150
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:29,630
And in private, Prince Charles said that the
Spencers were 'more royal than the Royals'!

151
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,730
It seemed that Diana and Charles were perfect
together.

152
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:41,560
People in Britain began to look forward to
a fairy-tale wedding.

153
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:49,500
Diana grew up with the Royal Family, but for
a long time she didn't really know Charles.

154
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,820
There are a lot of families in the royal circle,
and also Charles was twelve years older than

155
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,700
her.

156
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:03,300
He was already a young man when she was still
a child.

157
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:09,800
But when Diana was sixteen, they met at a
country house party.

158
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,550
She was only a schoolgirl, and Charles was
more interested in his dog and his sport than

159
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,860
in her.

160
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:24,880
But from that time, Diana put a photo of Charles
by her bed.

161
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:32,930
They met at a few more parties, but it was
only in July 1980 that Charles began to look

162
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,640
at Diana with new eyes.

163
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,560
They were both staying with friends in the
country.

164
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,580
In the evening, Diana sat next to Charles
outside in the garden.

165
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,010
She was telling him that she saw him at a
funeral a year earlier.

166
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,990
'You looked so sad,' she said.

167
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:03,700
'I thought, "It's wrong that you're alone
- you need someone to look after you."'

168
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:11,200
Charles's heart opened to her, and from then
on he was seriously interested in her.

169
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:18,770
He asked her out for an evening of music,
with supper later at Buckingham Palace.

170
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:25,750
But he didn't give Diana much time - she only
had twenty minutes to wash her hair and get

171
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,100
ready!

172
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,390
'Maybe you'll be the next Queen of England!'

173
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,850
a friend told her.

174
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,620
Diana only laughed.

175
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:44,490
Then Charles asked her to go to Balmoral for
the Braemar Games, the Scottish sports which

176
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,140
happen every September.

177
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:55,610
Diana's sister Jane was now married to Robert
Fellowes, the Queen's personal secretary.

178
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:01,890
They had a small house in the royal park at
Balmoral, and Diana stayed there with her

179
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,930
sister and husband.

180
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:11,310
Prince Charles phoned her every day, and they
went for walks together.

181
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,710
Until then, no one guessed that the Prince
had a new girlfriend.

182
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:23,380
But, one day, Charles and Diana were fishing
down by the River Dee.

183
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,990
Suddenly they noticed someone on the other
side of the river.

184
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:35,800
It was a reporter from a newspaper looking
for royal news.

185
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:42,920
Diana quickly ran to hide behind some trees,
and used a mirror from her handbag to watch

186
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
him.

187
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,170
Two other photographers hurried to the same
place by the river.

188
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:58,100
They were all very excited, trying to see
this new woman in Charles's life.

189
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,370
Diana escaped from them that day.

190
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:07,010
But soon the reporters knew her name, and
it was in all the newspapers.

191
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:11,690
Now her life began to change.

192
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:18,800
The public wanted to know all about her, and
paparazzi followed her everywhere.

193
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,270
They followed her in her little red Mini-Metro
car.

194
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:29,370
They phoned her in the middle of the night
and waited for her outside the Young England

195
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,890
School.

196
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,770
Even when she agreed to a photograph, they
still made trouble.

197
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:44,960
The light was shining behind her skirt and
showed all of her long, beautiful legs!

198
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:53,330
It was a very difficult time for a shy young
girl, and the Royal Family didn't help her.

199
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,390
Even Charles was not amused by the photograph.

200
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:08,630
Diana began to understand that even famous
and popular people can be very much alone.

201
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:17,870
When Prince Charles finally asked her to marry
him, in February 1981, she agreed.

202
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:23,000
She arrived back at her flat very happy that
night.

203
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,250
Her friends were waiting for her.

204
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,480
They knew that it was something special!

205
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:38,390
Diana said, 'I've got news for you - but I
must go to the toilet first!'

206
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:44,190
So they all knocked on the toilet door until
she told them!

207
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,780
'I'm going to marry Prince Charles!'

208
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,860
she called out, half laughing and half-crying.

209
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:59,360
He gave her a beautiful blue ring, and they
were ready now for the photographs, the television

210
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,190
recordings and the public appearances.

211
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:10,160
Several times, they had to answer the question,
'Are you in love?'

212
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,010
'Of course!'

213
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,860
answered Diana.

214
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,060
But Charles was not so sure.

215
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:24,680
His answer always seemed to be, 'Yes - but
what does that mean?'

216
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,810
To the public, it was real love.

217
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,420
It was exciting news for Britain.

218
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:38,650
Here was a fairy-tale prince and princess,
bringing new colour and life into the Royal

219
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,890
Family.

220
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:49,240
Diana now moved into Clarence House, the Queen
Mother's home, and was safer there from the

221
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,870
reporters.

222
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:58,240
Everyone was getting ready for the wedding
- over ten-thousand presents arrived for Charles

223
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,200
and Diana!

224
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,920
She chose a young husband and wife, David
and Elizabeth Emanuel, to make her wedding

225
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,140
dress.

226
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,250
'She made coffee for us,' they remembered.

227
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:20,080
'Here was the future Princess of Wales, and
we were students not so long ago.

228
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,130
It was quite a surprise.'

229
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,620
But not everything was perfect.

230
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,540
At the centre of the fairy-tale, there was
a black shadow.

231
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:40,930
When Charles asked Diana to marry him, something
strange happened.

232
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:47,460
She suddenly felt, deep inside, that she would
never be Queen.

233
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:54,350
She also knew that she would have a difficult
job as Charles's wife.

234
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,470
This did not stop her.

235
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:02,960
But, just before the wedding, she became seriously
worried.

236
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:10,350
She suddenly understood that Charles's old
girlfriend, Camilla Parker-Bowles, was still

237
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,860
very important to him.

238
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:21,480
Diana found a present from Charles to Camilla,
and he often telephoned her.

239
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:29,590
Did Charles really love her, or was he still
in love with Camilla?

240
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,940
And Diana was no longer free.

241
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:39,550
The happy days in her flat with her friends,
and at work with the little children, were

242
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,320
all gone.

243
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,040
The 'royal machine' frightened her.

244
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:53,320
There were so many royal rules, and Buckingham
Palace was a 'dead' place to her.

245
00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:02,500
No one welcomed her when she arrived at Clarence
House, and no one told her how to do things.

246
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,830
She still tried to enjoy herself.

247
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:11,809
She escaped to Australia for a quiet holiday
with her mother where none of the paparazzi

248
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:14,630
could find them.

249
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:21,880
Back at Clarence House, she wanted to go on
with her dancing, and so she asked her old

250
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,990
teacher to come and work with her.

251
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:31,600
But she knew that soon nothing would be the
same.

252
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:41,770
During one of her last lessons she said, 'In
twelve days' time, I shall no longer be me.'

253
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:47,350
She got thinner, and she even wanted to stop
the wedding.

254
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,780
Her sisters told her to go on.

255
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,610
'Bad luck - you've got to do it!

256
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,250
Your face is on the tea-towels now!'

257
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,170
they said.

258
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:11,330
So on 29 July 1981, Prince Charles married
Lady Diana Spencer in St Paul's Cathedral,

259
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,730
London.

260
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,050
It was a great day for England.

261
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,870
More than a million people were out on the
streets in the morning to wave as she went

262
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,090
by.

263
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:29,070
In Britain, everything stopped as people switched
on the television.

264
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:36,960
In many houses there were little parties as
families, friends and neighbours all sat down

265
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,210
together to enjoy themselves.

266
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,290
Diana arrived at St Paul's with her father.

267
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:50,679
The church was full of important people from
all over the world.

268
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:56,570
Not only was the British Royal Family there,
but there were other kings and queens from

269
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,690
Europe.

270
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:05,120
There was beautiful music, and the church
was full of flowers.

271
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,840
Diana looked wonderful in her long wedding
dress, which was almost white, with the skirt

272
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,010
very long at the back.

273
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:22,300
With flowers in her hands, and her heart full
of hope, she agreed to marry Charles.

274
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:27,320
'I will,' she said.

275
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,940
Charles put the wedding ring on her finger.

276
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,620
It was made of Welsh gold.

277
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:42,450
This gold was a present to the Royal Family
about fifty years earlier, and Diana's ring

278
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,770
was made of the very last piece.

279
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,830
Charles and Diana were now husband and wife.

280
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,860
They promised to stay together all their lives.

281
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,510
The crowds who were shouting 'Lady Di!

282
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,540
Lady Di!'

283
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:06,510
now changed the words to 'Princess Di!

284
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,770
Princess Di!'

285
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:17,280
They went back to Buckingham Palace, where
Charles kissed his new wife in public.

286
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:24,880
Then they left for their wedding holiday,
first at a house called Broadlands, then on

287
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,790
the royal ship, Britannia.

288
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:33,160
Diana was suddenly the world's favourite woman.

289
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:42,049
Her face really was on the tea-towels - and
on cups, glasses, spoons, and all kinds of

290
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:47,340
things that people bought at the time of the
Royal Wedding.

291
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:54,760
They wanted something to record and remember
that special day, the most important royal

292
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:03,590
day since Elizabeth became Queen in June 1953.

293
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:10,500
In some ways, Queen Elizabeth was still part
of a picture which was painted by the famous

294
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,400
Queen Victoria over a hundred years before.

295
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,960
In this picture, the Royal Family is a good
Christian family.

296
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:28,190
They show a polite face in public, and keep
all their problems secret.

297
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:35,660
Royal children must learn that their country
comes first, and their personal life second.

298
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:45,820
Sadly, this can also give us a Royal Family
which seems cold and far away.

299
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,809
Queen Elizabeth did try to make the Royal
Family more modern.

300
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:59,350
Once, most royal children studied at home,
but her son Prince Charles went away to school

301
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,059
and university.

302
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:10,670
In the 1960s television cameras recorded her
home and her family life for the first time,

303
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:15,610
so that people began to know the Royal Family
a little bit better.

304
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:22,860
But, in the end, it was not enough for modern
times.

305
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:28,010
So could the fairy-tale marriage possibly
have a happy ending?

306
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:32,790
Did Charles really love Diana when he married
her?

307
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:40,370
He probably tried to do his best at the time,
but it was difficult for him, too.

308
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:47,000
In the past, kings and princes married to
make the Royal Family stronger and to have

309
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,080
children.

310
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:57,730
Now Charles had to find the right wife for
the Royal Family, and marry for love.

311
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:05,160
Could Diana be the perfect royal wife, when
she was also a modern girl?

312
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,760
In 1981, we didn't ask ourselves these questions.

313
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:19,290
We all wanted to enjoy the fairy tale while
we could.

314
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,470
CHAPTER THREE

315
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,179
The Young Princess

316
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:32,160
In her new marriage, Diana was like a young
bird who was learning to fly.

317
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,120
At school, she was too shy to speak in public.

318
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:44,140
Now she was making public appearances all
the time as one of the Royal Family.

319
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:50,830
One of her first public visits was in May
just before she got married.

320
00:30:50,830 --> 00:31:00,880
This was to Tetbury, a town near Prince Charles's
new country home at Highgrove in Gloucestershire.

321
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,680
Crowds of people came out to see Diana.

322
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:10,640
Dressed in a red suit, she walked through
the streets and smiled shyly as they gave

323
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,880
her bunches of flowers.

324
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:20,210
It took some time before she wasn't frightened
of these public appearances.

325
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:25,929
On one of the first that she made with Prince
Charles, he told her to walk over to the waiting

326
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:26,929
crowds.

327
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:30,830
'Talk to them,' he told her.

328
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,350
'I can't!

329
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,210
I just can't!'

330
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,090
she said.

331
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:44,210
But she had to, and after that, she found
it became easier and easier.

332
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:49,690
She was very natural, and everyone liked that.

333
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,730
People began to feel that they could talk
to her about their problems.

334
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:01,970
She was quickly becoming one of the most popular
women in the world.

335
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,460
Soon she was more popular than Charles.

336
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:11,179
He wasn't very pleased by this.

337
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:18,300
'I'm sorry I'm not my wife,' he said once
or twice to the crowds when he made visits

338
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,470
alone.

339
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:27,530
Everyone loved Diana because she was young
and beautiful.

340
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:34,700
During her first few years as a princess,
she learnt how to dress well, and people became

341
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,169
interested in her clothes.

342
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:44,620
After every appearance, the reporters described
what she was wearing.

343
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:51,700
There were photos in the newspapers recording
all her different dresses.

344
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,679
Before she got married, she still looked very
young.

345
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:02,940
Her face was round, and her clothes were nothing
special.

346
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:11,100
And when she first became Princess of Wales,
she still didn't always dress well.

347
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:18,970
Sometimes she wore dresses and hats that were
too old for her, like those for a 45-year-old

348
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,230
woman.

349
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:27,970
Then she became the well-dressed Diana that
we remember today.

350
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:38,730
She chose a lot of wonderful clothes - dinner
dresses, dance dresses, trousers, and suits.

351
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:46,690
She learnt to dress for all kinds of different
appearances - for special visits, for sports,

352
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,310
or for travel.

353
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:57,400
For public appearances, she had to wear clothes
that were comfortable, as well as beautiful.

354
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:05,010
She also had to remember how her enemy, the
wind, could blow those clothes about!

355
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:13,389
Diana began to buy from famous British clothes-makers,
which helped the clothes business in Britain.

356
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:21,720
Some of her favourites were Bruce Oldfield,
Zandra Rhodes, and Catherine Walker.

357
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,690
Sometimes she chose bravely - a low-cut, short
black dress, for example.

358
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:36,190
But she could also look like the perfect 'English
rose' in a pink, well-cut suit, or a long

359
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,359
white dance dress.

360
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:49,019
With her long legs, fair hair and wonderful
smile, she could look good in almost anything.

361
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:51,849
Then Diana became a mother too.

362
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:58,130
Before the baby was born, she felt sick a
lot of the time.

363
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:08,040
But she was healthy, and on 21 June 1982,
she went into St Mary's Hospital, London to

364
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,170
have her baby.

365
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:18,359
Charles stayed with her there, and the Queen's
private doctor looked after her.

366
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:23,369
At 9.03 p.m., the new prince was born.

367
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:25,049
Crowds were waiting outside.

368
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:27,910
'Nice one, Charlie!'

369
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,609
they shouted when they heard the news.

370
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:37,130
'He's got fair hair,' the proud father told
them.

371
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:42,900
At first the new parents couldn't agree on
names.

372
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:49,789
Charles wanted to call the baby Arthur, but
Diana preferred William.

373
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:57,819
On 3 August, in the Music Room at Buckingham
Palace, they gave their son the names William

374
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:00,369
Arthur Philip Louis.

375
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:10,720
Diana's first big public visit was to Australia,
New Zealand and Canada early in 1983.

376
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:19,740
Usually, royal babies and small children stayed
at home when their parents went to other countries.

377
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:25,799
When Prince Charles was only a little boy,
for example, his mother Queen Elizabeth went

378
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:28,950
away for several months.

379
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:34,980
And when they finally met again, she only
shook his hand.

380
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,779
Diana was a different kind of mother.

381
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:45,489
She wanted to keep her children with her,
and to give them plenty of love.

382
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:50,670
She wasn't afraid to hug and kiss them in
public.

383
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:56,130
So Charles and Diana took baby William with
them.

384
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:03,069
Great crowds came out to see the Prince and
Princess of Wales, and Diana quickly became

385
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:07,310
popular in those countries too.

386
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:15,660
She was always ready to do what people liked
best - on her first visit to Wales, she spoke

387
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,299
in Welsh.

388
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:26,150
Then, in New Zealand, she met a Maori woman,
and touched noses to say 'Hello', in the local

389
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,170
way.

390
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:38,740
Soon another baby was coming, and on 15 September
1984 Prince Harry was born.

391
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:47,089
When the family was in London, they lived
in a large flat at Kensington Palace.

392
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:53,410
It had four sitting- rooms, a dining-room,
and four bedrooms.

393
00:37:53,410 --> 00:38:02,670
Diana chose all the colours and the furniture,
and tried to make it a real family home.

394
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,289
Here she looked after her boys.

395
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:12,190
She often played with them, and helped them
with their early lessons.

396
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:17,970
But it was important that they met other children
too.

397
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:24,710
Charles wanted William and Harry to study
at home with a private teacher, but Diana

398
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,609
didn't agree.

399
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:35,880
So in September 1985, William went to his
first school.

400
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,680
In 1987, he went on to Wetherby School.

401
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:49,230
On his first day, she took him there just
like any other mother, and together they met

402
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,819
his new teacher.

403
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:58,579
Diana was now a busy princess, wife and mother.

404
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:05,289
But she was beginning to work with charities
now too, which quickly became one of the most

405
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:08,930
important things in her life.

406
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:18,090
In 1982, the newspapers reported that Diana
was now working with five charities.

407
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:24,700
By the time that she was 24, she was working
with eighteen.

408
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,200
She began to visit people in hospital.

409
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,530
She wasn't afraid to meet people who were
dying.

410
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:38,529
And she began to meet people with terrible
illnesses like AIDS.

411
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:46,299
A lot of people were frightened that you could
catch AIDS by touching someone; Diana held

412
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:52,130
the hand of a man with AIDS to show that this
wasn't true.

413
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:58,529
The photographs of this helped people with
AIDS a lot.

414
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:05,310
She worked hard, but she still wanted to have
a good time too.

415
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:12,109
She practised a special dance secretly with
the famous dancer, Wayne Sleep.

416
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:20,980
Then, one night at the theatre, she suddenly
went up to the front to dance with Wayne.

417
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,140
She wanted to surprise Prince Charles!

418
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:29,559
The newspapers were full of it the next day.

419
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:33,800
Only Prince Charles was not so pleased.

420
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:42,349
In private, he told her that it was not the
right thing for a princess to do.

421
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:46,819
Diana now had a new friend in the Royal Family.

422
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:54,569
This was Sarah Ferguson, or 'Fergie', who
married Prince Andrew, Charles's younger brother,

423
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:57,940
in 1986.

424
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:04,279
She was a girl with a warm heart, but she
wasn't always sensible.

425
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:12,440
One night, just before they got married, Prince
Andrew was having a 'men only' party.

426
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:18,049
'Fergie' and Diana dressed up as policewomen
to try and get in!

427
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:22,680
Again, the Royal Family were not pleased with
Diana.

428
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,420
She was becoming too wild...

429
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,680
Few people knew that at this time Diana was
not happy.

430
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,039
She seemed to have the perfect life.

431
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:40,160
But inside she was in trouble.

432
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:46,369
She was helping other people, but she needed
help herself.

433
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:55,130
She was popular, a great favourite of the
people, and reporters photographed her everywhere.

434
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:00,980
But in private, she was alone with her troubles.

435
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,989
CHAPTER FOUR

436
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:06,410
The Woman Inside

437
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:15,339
In November 1982, the Palace told the world
that Diana was 'in the best of health'.

438
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:22,589
She did not have an eating illness, as some
of the newspapers were saying.

439
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:28,750
Diana began to look too thin even before she
got married.

440
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:34,460
People thought that she was just tired, or
growing up.

441
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:39,609
But in fact, Diana was getting ill.

442
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:45,089
She ate too much, then made herself sick.

443
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:51,109
She ate large meals out of the refrigerator
late at night.

444
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:58,319
She ate cakes and chocolate, and was sometimes
sick several times a day.

445
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:07,119
At first she looked thin because she kept
no food down inside her.

446
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:15,359
But in the end, she learnt to hide her illness
so that she looked fine.

447
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:24,109
In January 1982, Diana fell down some stairs
when her first baby was on the way.

448
00:43:24,109 --> 00:43:28,810
It wasn't in the newspapers until a few weeks
later.

449
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:32,319
It was an accident, the Palace said.

450
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,259
It was only a few stairs.

451
00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:39,509
The doctor visited her and she was fine now.

452
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:43,740
There was nothing to worry about.

453
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:48,440
But Diana tried to kill herself that day.

454
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,299
Life was too much for her.

455
00:43:51,299 --> 00:43:58,160
She felt sick all the time before William
was born, and her new 'job' in the Royal Family

456
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,140
was very difficult.

457
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:06,000
Most of all, she felt that her husband wasn't
really interested in her.

458
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:14,150
On that day, he wanted to go out horse-riding,
and he wouldn't stay to talk to her.

459
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:20,020
After William was born, she felt very unhappy.

460
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:26,349
This happens to many women, of course, for
a short time after they have babies.

461
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:30,750
But Diana got worse, not better.

462
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:39,069
She sometimes cut herself with a knife, and
tried several more times to kill herself.

463
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:42,890
She was probably crying out for help.

464
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:53,240
Outside, she was still the perfect Princess
of Wales, but inside, she was hurting.

465
00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:00,210
Before Prince Harry was born, the hospital
told Diana that the baby was a boy.

466
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,880
She didn't tell Charles.

467
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,109
He really wanted a girl.

468
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:12,109
When he first saw their new son, he told her
this.

469
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:17,780
Suddenly Diana felt that this was the end
of their marriage.

470
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:23,039
'Something inside me died,' she told her friends
later.

471
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:30,200
She married for love, but perhaps Charles
didn't.

472
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,089
Did his family push him into the marriage?

473
00:45:33,089 --> 00:45:43,470
His real love, Camilla Parker- Bowles, was
already married, and he had to marry someone.

474
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:52,420
Perhaps he chose Diana only because she would
be the right sort of royal wife and mother.

475
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:57,339
Charles was still seeing Camilla when he was
married to Diana.

476
00:45:57,339 --> 00:46:05,299
On their wedding holiday, Diana saw that Charles
still kept photos of Camilla in his pocket.

477
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:11,599
And during the marriage, Charles still gave
Camilla presents, and often telephoned her

478
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,049
privately.

479
00:46:14,049 --> 00:46:20,309
The mother of Camilla's grandmother also had
a royal lover, King Edward VII.

480
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:26,019
Camilla, it seemed, was repeating the family
story.

481
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:30,630
But Charles and Camilla were friends, as well
as lovers.

482
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:39,059
They were the same age, and they were interested
in the same filings, like horses and the country.

483
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:45,779
Many women did not find Charles an easy man,
but Camilla seemed to understand him well.

484
00:46:45,779 --> 00:46:50,279
Earlier, a lot of his girlfriends got tired
of him.

485
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:54,749
He could be warm one day, and cold the next.

486
00:46:54,749 --> 00:47:00,869
He spent time with them, then disappeared
for a long time.

487
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:05,430
Even Camilla stopped waiting for him when
she was young.

488
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:11,109
She married another man, Andrew Parker-Bowles.

489
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:16,960
Charles and Diana were different ages, and
they liked different things.

490
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:24,539
He wanted to read books on their wedding holiday;
Diana wanted to enjoy the sun and the sea.

491
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:30,229
He wanted to talk about serious ideas, when
she wanted to give everything to their new

492
00:47:30,229 --> 00:47:32,819
love.

493
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:39,089
It was soon clear to them both that they thought
and felt very differently.

494
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:45,529
In public, they were still husband and wife,
but in private they were sleeping in separate

495
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,069
bedrooms.

496
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:52,079
People were beginning to see that all was
not well.

497
00:47:52,079 --> 00:48:01,049
In Canada in 1986, Diana fell down in public
because she was so ill and unhappy.

498
00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:06,690
The same year, Prince Charles came home early
from their holiday in Majorca.

499
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:14,119
Then, in 1987, he went up to Balmoral alone
for a month.

500
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:19,859
He told the reporters that he had a lot of
work to do there.

501
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:26,989
Diana was working hard for the Royal Family
and the country, but she was still very unsure

502
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:29,569
of herself.

503
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:36,280
She was always waiting for Charles and the
Royal Family to say 'Well done!'

504
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,109
They never did.

505
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:44,880
But in 1988, life began to change for her.

506
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,380
She found that she could be strong.

507
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:55,459
A terrible accident happened when she and
Charles were on holiday in Switzerland with

508
00:48:55,459 --> 00:48:57,589
a group of friends.

509
00:48:57,589 --> 00:49:06,729
Snow came down from the mountains and killed
Hugh Lindsay, one of their best friends.

510
00:49:06,729 --> 00:49:11,390
Diana was in bed with a cold at the time.

511
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:18,509
One of Charles's secretaries arrived back
at the house with the terrible news.

512
00:49:18,509 --> 00:49:22,489
Diana decided what she needed to do.

513
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:27,410
She put all Lindsay's clothes into his suitcase.

514
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:32,900
She and Charles flew back to England with
the body.

515
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:38,670
Then Diana looked after Hugh Lindsay's wife,
Sarah.

516
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:45,369
The Lindsays only got married a few months
before the holiday, and Sarah was having a

517
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:47,359
baby.

518
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:53,969
And then Diana decided that it was time to
help herself, too.

519
00:49:53,969 --> 00:50:00,749
Carolyn, her old schoolfriend, said, 'I'll
give you an hour.

520
00:50:00,749 --> 00:50:09,140
If you don't go to a doctor, I'll tell the
world about your illness!'

521
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:15,019
Diana went to see a special doctor for help
with her eating illness.

522
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:24,170
'How many times have you tried to kill yourself?'
he asked her at once.

523
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:28,410
'Four or five times,' she said.

524
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:36,150
She was very surprised that he seemed to know
all about her so quickly.

525
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:42,249
In six months' time, he told her, she could
be a new person.

526
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:49,700
He visited her every week, and she began to
read books about the illness and to understand

527
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,599
herself better.

528
00:50:52,599 --> 00:51:01,230
In six months, she was a new person, and she
was almost better.

529
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:05,770
It was the beginning of a new way of life
for her.

530
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:11,249
She had to help herself; Charles wouldn't
help her.

531
00:51:11,249 --> 00:51:13,660
He didn't love her as she wanted.

532
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:17,920
And he never would.

533
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:24,440
She also learnt to give her love to the poor
and ill people that she met through her charity

534
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,579
work.

535
00:51:25,579 --> 00:51:30,380
She had a special touch.

536
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:40,749
When she visited people in hospital, a hug
or a kiss from Diana seemed to help them greatly.

537
00:51:40,749 --> 00:51:48,229
Sometimes she continued to visit people for
a long time until they were better.

538
00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:52,410
She often wrote them kind letters later.

539
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:58,829
A lot of her charity work was with children,
and she was always happy and natural with

540
00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:01,599
them.

541
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:09,920
At home, it was the beginning of the war between
Diana and the Royal Family.

542
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:15,010
It was difficult for people who worked for
Charles and Diana.

543
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:19,969
They had to decide which side they were on.

544
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:26,209
You had to be a 'Charles person' or a 'Diana
person'.

545
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:32,339
If you tried to be both, you quickly got into
trouble.

546
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:39,690
Diana began to think of 'Charles's people'
as 'the enemy.'

547
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:43,509
They now lived two separate lives in the family
too.

548
00:52:43,509 --> 00:52:48,959
There was Diana's life, and Charles's life.

549
00:52:48,959 --> 00:52:52,650
This was true even for the boys.

550
00:52:52,650 --> 00:53:00,839
When Diana took them out, they went to modern
places that children like - water game parks

551
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:03,329
or the cinema.

552
00:53:03,329 --> 00:53:10,249
They usually wore ordinary clothes like jeans
and T-shirts.

553
00:53:10,249 --> 00:53:19,430
With Charles, they wore more grown-up clothes,
and did country things that he enjoyed, like

554
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,200
fishing.

555
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:29,029
The public began to think worse of Charles
when Prince William had a serious accident

556
00:53:29,029 --> 00:53:33,410
at school in 1991.

557
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:41,459
Diana stayed at the hospital with him all
night but Charles went off to the theatre.

558
00:53:41,459 --> 00:53:44,479
'How could he do that?'

559
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:46,119
people asked.

560
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:51,570
'What sort of a father is he?'

561
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:58,950
Charles loved his sons too, but perhaps he
didn't understand how to show it.

562
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:07,749
He did try to do better after that, but many
people were beginning to prefer Diana.

563
00:54:07,749 --> 00:54:09,249
But not everyone.

564
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:13,000
'She's ill,' some people were saying.

565
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,400
'She needs to be in hospital.'

566
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:22,299
Or: 'She's trying to hurt the Royal Family.

567
00:54:22,299 --> 00:54:26,450
They must stop her!'

568
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:31,099
Diana was beginning to make a new life for
herself.

569
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:41,660
It was difficult, and she was often unhappy,
but it was the only way out.

570
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,219
CHAPTER FIVE

571
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:47,690
The New Diana

572
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:54,099
The Queen called 1992 a 'terrible year'.

573
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:57,959
It began badly for Diana, too.

574
00:54:57,959 --> 00:55:03,949
On 29 March, her much-loved father died.

575
00:55:03,949 --> 00:55:10,759
She was on holiday in Austria, and she flew
home at once for the funeral.

576
00:55:10,759 --> 00:55:17,900
Prince Charles flew back with her to England,
but she went to the funeral alone.

577
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:23,289
The newspapers, of course, were quick to notice
this.

578
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:26,890
It was a month for royal stories.

579
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:35,339
The Palace told the world that the marriage
of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson was over.

580
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:43,739
Then a new book came out about Princess Diana:
Diana - Her True Story by Andrew Morton.

581
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:52,579
The book talked about Diana's eating illness,
and about how unhappy she was with Prince

582
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:56,269
Charles and the Royal Family.

583
00:55:56,269 --> 00:56:02,869
It also talked about Prince Charles and Camilla
Parker-Bowles.

584
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:07,130
At first, everyone was very surprised.

585
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:10,039
Could it all be true?

586
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:19,499
In the end, people realised that most of it
was Diana's real story.

587
00:56:19,499 --> 00:56:25,690
But there was another surprise coming for
her - and an unpleasant one.

588
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:31,989
Diana was beginning, secretly, to look for
a new love in her life.

589
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:38,319
She had to be very careful, because she and
Charles were still married.

590
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:43,869
The world would not think well of a royal
mother with other lovers.

591
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:50,920
Then suddenly, recordings of secret phone
calls between Diana and James Gilbey came

592
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,140
out.

593
00:56:53,140 --> 00:57:01,479
Gilbey was an old friend of Diana's, but here
they were talking as lovers.

594
00:57:01,479 --> 00:57:07,890
Someone recorded the conversations, the newspapers
said, two years earlier.

595
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:15,269
In them, Gilbey uses a special name for Diana
- 'Squidgy'.

596
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:24,859
He asks Diana to kiss him down the phone,
and says, 'Oh Squidgy, I love you, love you,

597
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:28,019
love you!'

598
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:35,670
Another lover was James Hewitt, the man who
taught Diana to ride again - she was still

599
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:40,740
afraid of horses after her accident as a child.

600
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:47,469
Will Carling, the sportsman, and his wife
ended their marriage because of Diana.

601
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:52,180
Then there was Oliver Hoare, who sold paintings.

602
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:59,920
Someone began to make silent phone calls to
his home; perhaps it was Diana, unhappy because

603
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,720
Oliver didn't want to talk to her.

604
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:10,190
We will probably never know everything about
her life at this time, but it's clear that

605
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:13,630
she was seeing other men.

606
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:22,740
Then in 1993 recordings of phone, conversations
between Charles and Camilla appeared, and

607
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:28,069
everyone now knew for sure that they were
lovers.

608
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:36,490
Charles was very unhappy about this, and at
first promised to live alone without women.

609
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:41,209
A year later, he talked about it all on television.

610
00:58:41,209 --> 00:58:45,589
But he didn't stop seeing Camilla.

611
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:51,609
In the photos of 1992, Diana is often alone.

612
00:58:51,609 --> 00:58:57,150
In one, she is sitting in front of the Taj
Mahal in India.

613
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:06,499
She is smiling, but she looks very small and
alone in front of the big white building.

614
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:14,569
In November 1992, Charles and Diana did make
a visit together to Korea, but they were clearly

615
00:59:14,569 --> 00:59:16,219
unhappy.

616
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:22,890
Finally, in December they told the public
that they were separating.

617
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:31,630
Prince Charles would stay at Highgrove, and
Diana would live alone at Kensington Palace.

618
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:37,849
The children would spend time with both of
their parents.

619
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:43,049
The Queen's family was in trouble all around
her.

620
00:59:43,049 --> 00:59:51,309
Just to finish the terrible story of 1992,
there was a serious fire at Windsor Castle,

621
00:59:51,309 --> 00:59:54,430
the Queen's favourite home.

622
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:59,690
Everyone there, the Queen too, worked hard
to put it out.

623
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:07,029
But the Castle and the Royal Family would
never be the same again.

624
01:00:07,029 --> 01:00:15,440
Diana's private rooms at Kensington Palace
were full of photos of William and Harry.

625
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,359
'They mean everything to me,' she said.

626
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:24,900
But now she couldn't be with them so much.

627
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:31,319
A lot of the time, they were at school or
with their father.

628
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:38,299
She even had to eat her Christmas dinner alone
while William and Harry spent Christmas day

629
01:00:38,299 --> 01:00:42,769
with their father and grandmother.

630
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:49,789
But she was doing her best to help her sons
for their future as royal princes, and William

631
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:54,209
perhaps as the future King of England.

632
01:00:54,209 --> 01:01:00,979
She decided that they needed to understand
some of the country's problems.

633
01:01:00,979 --> 01:01:05,869
She took them to visit sick people in hospitals.

634
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:13,529
But she also took them out secretly to see
some of the dark and unpleasant places where

635
01:01:13,529 --> 01:01:19,369
homeless people spend the night.

636
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:27,640
In 1995, William went to Eton, one of the
top schools in the country, but he didn't

637
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:33,279
forget the other side of life that Diana showed
him.

638
01:01:33,279 --> 01:01:41,369
He later gave Diana the idea of selling a
lot of her dresses for charity.

639
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:46,509
Diana's new life had good times in it, too.

640
01:01:46,509 --> 01:01:49,440
She had plenty of friends.

641
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:57,519
Many of them were famous, and some of them
were filmstars or popstars.

642
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:05,749
She was friendly with the popstars Elton John
and George Michael, and with Terence Stamp

643
01:02:05,749 --> 01:02:10,019
and Richard Attenborough, the filmstars.

644
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:18,189
She knew Luciano Pavarotti, the Italian singer,
and others from the music and film world,

645
01:02:18,189 --> 01:02:26,099
like Michael Jackson, Paul and Linda McCartney,
and Liza Minelli.

646
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:28,599
She often had lunch with friends.

647
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:38,069
An Italian restaurant, San Lorenzo in Kensington
was her favourite for a long time.

648
01:02:38,069 --> 01:02:45,680
She still loved dancing and pop music, and
she went swimming or running every day to

649
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,369
keep in good shape.

650
01:02:48,369 --> 01:02:53,839
Diana was very serious about her health now.

651
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,769
But she couldn't escape from the paparazzi.

652
01:02:57,769 --> 01:03:03,069
Everywhere she went, they tried to take photographs
of her.

653
01:03:03,069 --> 01:03:09,420
Sometimes they took photos secretly - you
could get a lot of money for a new photo of

654
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,520
Diana.

655
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:16,759
Suddenly, it was all too much for her.

656
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:24,549
In December 1993, she told the world that
she wanted to live quietly.

657
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:28,619
She would stop most of her work for charities.

658
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:34,589
She needed time for her children, and for
her private life.

659
01:03:34,589 --> 01:03:37,049
It was not for long.

660
01:03:37,049 --> 01:03:44,329
She soon came back because she wanted to get
on with her work, and be 'a mother to the

661
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:48,480
world', as one newspaper wrote.

662
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:58,119
And the story of Diana and Charles was not
over yet; in November 1995 she recorded her

663
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:02,890
famous appearance on television.

664
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:10,559
She talked openly to reporter Martin Bashir
about her life in the Royal Family, and she

665
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,020
was clearly hurt and angry about the past.

666
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:22,329
'There were three in this marriage,' she said
about Charles and Camilla.

667
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:28,289
And three, as she told us, is a crowd.

668
01:04:28,289 --> 01:04:31,609
But she also talked about her future.

669
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:41,430
'I don't think many people will want me to
be Queen... because I do things differently,

670
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:46,220
because I don't go by a rule book.'

671
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:52,349
She worked, she said, 'from the heart, not
the head'.

672
01:04:52,349 --> 01:04:57,309
But she wanted 'to be Queen of people's hearts'.

673
01:04:57,309 --> 01:05:02,689
These were words which the world never forgot.

674
01:05:02,689 --> 01:05:08,799
A lot of people that she helped will never
forget her either.

675
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:15,569
One of her favourite charities was Centrepoint,
which looks after homeless people.

676
01:05:15,569 --> 01:05:26,869
Vincent Seabrook, a man of 27 now working
as a private guard, remembers her well.

677
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:35,130
He was living homeless on the streets when
Diana came past and stopped to talk to him.

678
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:45,019
'She got me something to eat and drink, listened
to me, and gave me the number for Centrepoint,'

679
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:47,779
he said.

680
01:05:47,779 --> 01:05:54,990
She wasn't frightened of illness, or of people
who had serious problems with their bodies.

681
01:05:54,990 --> 01:06:01,509
She was ready with a hug or a kiss for everyone.

682
01:06:01,509 --> 01:06:06,599
A man who couldn't see wanted to know what
Diana was like.

683
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:12,720
'Is it all right if I touch your face?' he
asked.

684
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,210
'Of course you can,' she said.

685
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:25,099
He moved his hands over her eyes, nose and
mouth until he could see a picture of her

686
01:06:25,099 --> 01:06:26,749
in his head.

687
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:32,960
'You're very pretty!' he said.

688
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,400
When someone was in trouble, she tried to
help them.

689
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:44,049
Once in hospital, she heard a woman crying.

690
01:06:44,049 --> 01:06:51,329
The woman's son, Dean, was badly hurt in a
car accident.

691
01:06:51,329 --> 01:06:58,609
Diana sat with the young man that night, and
visited him again later.

692
01:06:58,609 --> 01:07:03,309
She even went to his house when he was better,
and met his children.

693
01:07:03,309 --> 01:07:06,259
'What shall we call you?'

694
01:07:06,259 --> 01:07:07,689
they all asked.

695
01:07:07,689 --> 01:07:12,900
'Just Diana,' she said.

696
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:21,729
She often visited children's hospitals like
Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children.

697
01:07:21,729 --> 01:07:29,539
Victoria Hemphill, a young girl with a serious
heart problem, felt that the Princess was

698
01:07:29,539 --> 01:07:37,180
her special friend, and kept photos of Diana
by her bed.

699
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:45,359
Diana often talked to her about William and
Harry, and the boys wrote to her.

700
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:54,160
'Dearest Victoria, I wanted to send you lots
of love while you were in hospital,' began

701
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:59,089
a letter from Prince Harry.

702
01:07:59,089 --> 01:08:04,359
Diana had time for her friends who were in
trouble, too.

703
01:08:04,359 --> 01:08:12,890
She helped a friend called Rosa when her baby
died, and gave time to another friend, Cosima,

704
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:15,779
when her marriage ended.

705
01:08:15,779 --> 01:08:22,049
She knew what it was like to feel hurt inside.

706
01:08:22,049 --> 01:08:25,449
She still travelled to other countries.

707
01:08:25,449 --> 01:08:32,120
In 1994 she visited Zimbabwe, in Africa.

708
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:39,549
Photos show that she helped to give out lunch
to children in a special school.

709
01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:43,759
She visited hospitals in Pakistan.

710
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:52,500
In India, she became friends with Mother Teresa,
who was famous for her work with poor people

711
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,440
who were dying on the streets.

712
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:07,779
Diana once said, 'I'm not frightened of dying,
if I can die happy.'

713
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:10,210
CHAPTER SIX

714
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:11,210
Her Last Days

715
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:24,549
After Diana's marriage finally ended in August
1996, she was a rich woman with over 17 million

716
01:09:24,549 --> 01:09:26,659
pounds.

717
01:09:26,659 --> 01:09:30,029
But she wanted to go on working.

718
01:09:30,029 --> 01:09:35,770
She specially wanted to stop the use of landmines.

719
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:43,710
She visited Angola and Bosnia, where there
are still terrible problems with landmines

720
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:47,069
after the wars there.

721
01:09:47,069 --> 01:09:55,940
She met people who lost legs or arms from
these landmines - not only men, but little

722
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:59,429
children too.

723
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:06,889
When she spoke out against the landmines,
not everyone agreed with her.

724
01:10:06,889 --> 01:10:13,900
But Diana was still ready to speak from the
heart.

725
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:18,460
She had a good summer in 1997.

726
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:23,230
She visited her brother, Charles, in South
Africa.

727
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:30,639
She spent her birthday there, and enjoyed
a holiday with Charles and his family without

728
01:10:30,639 --> 01:10:33,840
any of the usual trouble from the paparazzi.

729
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:42,949
There was only one sad time in the middle
of July, when she went to Italy for the funeral

730
01:10:42,949 --> 01:10:49,489
of her friend Gianni Versace, the famous clothes-maker.

731
01:10:49,489 --> 01:10:55,059
Something very special was happening in Diana's
life that summer too.

732
01:10:55,059 --> 01:10:58,340
She had a new boyfriend.

733
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:03,429
This was Dodi Al Fayed, a film-maker, who
was 42.

734
01:11:03,429 --> 01:11:12,130
The Al Fayeds are a Moslem family from Egypt,
but they live in England.

735
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:22,360
They are very rich; the famous London shop,
Harrods, and the Ritz Hotel in Paris belong

736
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:27,860
to Mohammed Al Fayed, Dodi's father.

737
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:34,680
The Al Fayed family and the Spencer family
were already friends.

738
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:43,280
Diana first met Dodi about ten years earlier,
but they didn't become good friends until

739
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:51,610
she went on holiday to France with the Al
Fayed family in July 1997.

740
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:57,710
Harry and William went too, and they all had
a wonderful time.

741
01:11:57,710 --> 01:12:03,250
It was the best holiday for years, Diana said
later.

742
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:11,659
And soon Diana and Dodi became more than friends;
they fell in love.

743
01:12:11,659 --> 01:12:17,410
They went away on holiday again at the end
of that month, but they were alone together

744
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:19,670
this time.

745
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:25,800
They visited Corsica and Sardinia in the Al
Fayeds' private boat.

746
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:31,070
The paparazzi soon knew that they were lovers.

747
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:39,119
And then, of course, they all wanted to get
pictures and stories of Diana and Dodi.

748
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:48,980
The man who took the first photos of their
kisses sold the pictures for a million dollars.

749
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:57,670
On 21 August, Diana flew back to France again
to start a third holiday with Dodi.

750
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:01,360
By now, they were deeply in love.

751
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:08,280
He gave her presents, and it's possible that
they planned to get married.

752
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:14,619
Dodi was married before, and had a lot of
girlfriends after that.

753
01:13:14,619 --> 01:13:18,780
But he was very serious about Diana.

754
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:23,239
This third holiday ended suddenly because
of the paparazzi.

755
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:33,750
When their boat arrived at Sardinia, the photographers
ran after Dodi and Diana everywhere.

756
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:40,310
They even found them at a hotel where they
were staying secretly.

757
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:47,480
That was enough - the lovers decided to leave
at once for Paris.

758
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:53,920
They arrived on Saturday, 30 August.

759
01:13:53,920 --> 01:14:00,780
Dodi had a small home in Paris, which they
tried to use secretly.

760
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:08,469
During the afternoon, Dodi went out to get
a very expensive ring which he was buying

761
01:14:08,469 --> 01:14:11,619
as a present for Diana.

762
01:14:11,619 --> 01:14:16,739
It was a ring that she would never wear.

763
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:24,920
The paparazzi knew Diana and Dodi were now
in Paris and were following them again.

764
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:31,030
They planned to eat dinner at a restaurant
in the city centre, but decided that it wasn't

765
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:33,530
safe there.

766
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:40,790
They went on to the Ritz, the hotel which
belongs to Dodi's father.

767
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:49,599
When they arrived at the Ritz, there were
already about 40 paparazzi waiting for them.

768
01:14:49,599 --> 01:14:57,760
At last, just after midnight, they left the
hotel by the back door to go back to Dodi's

769
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,920
house.

770
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:05,929
They were trying to escape, and sent off another
car from the front.

771
01:15:05,929 --> 01:15:12,699
But some of the paparazzi saw Diana and Dodi
as they drove off in their special Mercedes

772
01:15:12,699 --> 01:15:17,550
car with their driver and bodyguard.

773
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:26,460
'You won't catch me!' said the driver, Henri
Paul, as he drove faster and faster; so did

774
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:34,179
the paparazzi, some in cars, and several on
very fast bikes.

775
01:15:34,179 --> 01:15:40,199
There were cameras and lights everywhere,
as they tried to photograph Diana's car.

776
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:47,739
When the road came to the River Seine, it
went underground.

777
01:15:47,739 --> 01:15:56,090
The car was now travelling very fast - perhaps
at over 160 km an hour.

778
01:15:56,090 --> 01:16:00,050
It hit a wall.

779
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:05,559
The crash killed Dodi and the driver at once.

780
01:16:05,559 --> 01:16:11,409
The bodyguard, Trevor Rees-Jones, was still
alive.

781
01:16:11,409 --> 01:16:18,179
So was Diana - but she was very badly hurt.

782
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:25,030
It took more than an hour before they could
get her out of the crashed car.

783
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:31,219
They took her to hospital, where doctors tried
to save her life.

784
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:33,719
But it was no good.

785
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:39,960
She died at about four o'clock in the morning.

786
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:47,250
Soon telephones were ringing in Britain as
people heard the news and phoned to tell their

787
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:51,090
friends and families.

788
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:59,369
Some heard it on the television or radio at
the end of a long night's work, and it seemed

789
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:04,090
that it couldn't possibly be true.

790
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:10,860
At Balmoral, Prince Charles woke his sons
William and Harry to tell them the terrible

791
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,239
news.

792
01:17:13,239 --> 01:17:22,570
That afternoon, Charles left Scotland by plane
with Diana's two sisters Sarah and Jane.

793
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:28,310
They flew to Paris together to bring her body
home.

794
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:36,510
During the week, newspapers, television and
radio were full of Diana's sad story.

795
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:42,130
People cried and left bunches of flowers for
her.

796
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:48,449
By the middle of the first day, there were
over a thousand bunches outside Kensington

797
01:17:48,449 --> 01:17:51,210
Palace.

798
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:57,659
By the end of the week, it was like a sea
of flowers there.

799
01:17:57,659 --> 01:18:06,510
With the flowers there were cards and letters:
'To our sweet Princess - Thank you for the

800
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:08,719
love you showed us all.'

801
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:17,710
'Queen of Hearts' and 'Princess of Love' were
words that came up again and again.

802
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:24,090
'We'll never forget you,' the letters said.

803
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:30,540
And during that week, the mystery about the
car crash was growing.

804
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:37,139
When Trevor Rees-Jones, the bodyguard, finally
woke up in hospital, he couldn't remember

805
01:18:37,139 --> 01:18:39,780
the accident.

806
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:48,179
We now know that the driver, Henri Paul, had
too much to drink that evening - far too much.

807
01:18:48,179 --> 01:18:56,560
But the paparazzi were driving too fast and
too near, and the photographers' lights were

808
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,520
too bright.

809
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,969
Did they make it happen, too?

810
01:19:01,969 --> 01:19:06,330
And was there a second car in the crash?

811
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:10,590
Some people even thought that it was murder.

812
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:19,639
This was probably just a wild story, but there
was still a mystery about the crash.

813
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:31,150
Diana's funeral was on Saturday, 6 September
1997, one week after she died.

814
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:36,750
On Friday night, thousands of people went
to London.

815
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:43,590
They stayed out all night, waiting for the
morning, when her body would travel from Kensington

816
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:47,400
Palace to Westminster Abbey.

817
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,030
Kensington Palace Gardens were beautiful.

818
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:56,810
It was a warm night, and there were flowers
by every tree.

819
01:19:56,810 --> 01:20:06,280
People of all ages sat quietly together in
little groups, remembering Diana.

820
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:14,400
Her funeral, like her wedding, brought famous
people together from all over the world.

821
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:20,330
Some were heads of governments, and others
were her friends.

822
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:26,460
Many were famous names from the worlds of
film and music.

823
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:30,040
All the Royal Family was there.

824
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:38,020
Princes Charles, William and Harry walked
behind Diana's body as it went into the church.

825
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:47,219
Her sons gave her white flowers with a card
that just said, 'Mummy'.

826
01:20:47,219 --> 01:20:54,530
In Hyde Park, crowds of thousands watched
the funeral on a big screen.

827
01:20:54,530 --> 01:21:01,570
Many cried as they listened to the words,
and heard some of Diana's favourite music.

828
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:11,460
Earlier that summer, Diana looked after her
friend Elton John at Gianni Versace's funeral.

829
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:16,409
Now he sang at her funeral.

830
01:21:16,409 --> 01:21:23,550
It was a song that he once wrote about the
film star, Marilyn Monroe.

831
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:29,289
Marilyn and Diana were both 36 when they died.

832
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:34,730
Elton changed the words for Diana.

833
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:38,710
'Goodbye England's rose,' he sang.

834
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:42,989
She would always 'grow in our hearts'.

835
01:21:42,989 --> 01:21:48,110
Then her brother, Charles, spoke about Diana.

836
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:54,070
He remembered how kind and beautiful she was.

837
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:59,030
'Today is our chance to say thank you...

838
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:07,380
We want you to know that life without you
is very, very difficult.'

839
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:14,329
He was very angry with the paparazzi who gave
her such a hard time.

840
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:21,239
And he promised to try and help her sons in
their future life.

841
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:30,670
The funeral car took Diana's body to the Spencer
family home at Althorp, in Northamptonshire.

842
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:36,429
People threw flowers in front of the car as
it went past.

843
01:22:36,429 --> 01:22:43,610
At first, her family planned to bring her
to the local church at Althorp, but then they

844
01:22:43,610 --> 01:22:47,300
decided against this.

845
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:52,850
Thousands of visitors could make life too
difficult for the small village.

846
01:22:52,850 --> 01:23:00,810
So, finally, they took Diana to a small island
in a lake in the gardens of Althorp Park.

847
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:11,310
Here her body lies in private, but once every
year, visitors can come to see the place where

848
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:15,110
she rests.

849
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:19,840
Diana's life is over, but her story is not.

850
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:27,389
The way that she lived and died will change
many things.

851
01:23:27,389 --> 01:23:33,639
Her life showed a new road for the Royal Family
to take.

852
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:40,730
She showed them a way to be nearer to the
British people and to help with real problems

853
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:44,489
in the modern world.

854
01:23:44,489 --> 01:23:52,360
When she died, we all remembered that life
can be very short.

855
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:59,570
Every one of us has to do our best with the
time that we have.

856
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:05,590
'It's important to show love,' said Diana.

857
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:07,330
We need to remember this too.
