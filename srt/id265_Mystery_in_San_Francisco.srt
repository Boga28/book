CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,560
Washington Square

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,200
Jim Reilly was fourteen years old and he lived in the beautiful
city of San Francisco in California.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,880
He was short, thin and wore glasses.

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,920
He had brown hair and blue eyes.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,120
His mother died when he was six years old and his father lived
in another city.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,200
Jim lived with his grandfather.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,520
This was his first year in high school and he liked it a lot.


9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,360
His favorite subject was science.

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,080
On weekends he had a part-time job at a supermarket to make extra
pocket money.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,680
Jim's home was on Telegraph Hill near San Francisco Bay.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,080
From his living room he could see the Golden Gate Bridge and
the bay.

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,160
Every morning he walked down Telegraph Hill.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,480
He met his friends at the bus stop at Washington Square.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,360
They went to high school together.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,160
Washington Square was a historical landmark and the people of
San Francisco loved to go there.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,440
It was a lovely park for children and adults.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,040
There was a small playground for children.

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,840
It was also a place for the people of the North Beach neighborhood
to meet.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,160
There were restaurants, cafes and nice shops around Washington
Square.

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,640
Often there were music and arts festivals.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,320
Normally, Washington Square had green grass and beautiful flowers.


23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,720
But there was no rain for a long time, and the grass was dry
and yellow and the flowers were dead.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,880
'Hi, Jim,' said Brian.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,240
Brian Wilson was Jim's best friend.

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,160
He was fourteen too.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,520
He was a tall boy, with blond, curly hair and green eyes.

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,160
He played basketball on the high school team.

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,000
His parents had a grocery store and he helped them on weekends.


30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,240
'Hi, Brian.

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,600
Did you finish your English homework?' said Jim.

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,240
'Yes, I did, but Shakespeare wasn't easy.

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,720
Look, there's Susan,' said Brian.

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,840
'Hi, guys,' said Susan.

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,920
Susan Hardy was a pretty African-American girl.

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,680
She was a good friend of both boys.

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,200
She was also a very good student.

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,480
She had a part-time job as a babysitter for the children of her
neighbors, the Moreno family.

39
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,240
Her brother Tom was twenty years old.

40
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,680
He was a biology student at San Francisco University and played
on the university football team.

41
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,920
'Are you ready for the math test?' asked Susan.

42
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,440
'I studied all afternoon yesterday, but I'm not ready,' said
Brian.

43
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,680
'I'm not either.

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,760
I didn't look at my notes,' said Jim.

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,880
The bus came and they got on.

46
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,640
They saw their school friends and started talking.

47
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,000
The bus was always crowded, but the bus ride was fun.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,640
When they got near Galileo High School they could smell the chocolate
from the chocolate factory nearby.

49
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
They loved the smell of the chocolate.

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,640
It made them hungry.

51
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
The math test was difficult.

52
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,000
The students were happy when it was finally lunchtime.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,320
hey all went to the big school cafeteria.

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,920
'Why is math so difficult?' said Jim.

55
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,280
'I think Mrs Miller makes the test difficult.'

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,160
'Don't worry about the test and eat your lunch,' said Brian.

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,920
In the afternoon they had a long science lesson.

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,080
It was very interesting.

59
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,560
They studied chemistry in the school laboratory.

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,680
They often did experiments with their chemistry teacher, Mr Woods.


61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,120
They liked Mr Woods.

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,600
At a quarter past three the school bell rang.

63
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,480
It was time to go home and it was Friday.

64
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,560
'What are you doing this weekend?' asked Brian.

65
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,440
'I'm working at the supermarket tomorrow,' said Jim.

66
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,880
'But on Sunday I'm coming to see your basketball game.'

67
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,200
'I hope we win,' said Brian.

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,000
'I'm working tomorrow as well, at my parents' grocery store.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,240
It's always a busy day.

70
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,560
But I'm free tomorrow night.'

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,760
'Well, I'm babysitting for the Moreno children all weekend,'
said Susan.

72
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,880
'Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow night, Jim?' asked
Brian.

73
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,920
'Yes, that's a great idea,' said Jim.

74
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,640
'I'll phone you.'

75
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,240
CHAPTER TWO

76
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,800
The Face at the Window

77
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,320
Jim walked slowly up Telegraph Hill.

78
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,040
It was a foggy afternoon in February.

79
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,640
Every day Jim walked in front of an old mansion.

80
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,480
It was a mysterious wooden building with a big garden and a fence
around it.

81
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,280
Jim often looked at it and thought, 'What's inside?

82
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,880
Why doesn't anyone live here?'

83
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,040
That afternoon he stopped in front of the gate.

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,760
He looked at the garden and the trees.

85
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,160
What a strange place.

86
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,960
No one took care of it.

87
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,120
Then he looked up at the old mansion.

88
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,760
He looked at the window on the second floor.

89
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,640
There was a face behind it.

90
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
He felt cold.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,280
It was the face of a little girl with long, dark hair.

92
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,960
But no one lived in that mansion.

93
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,520
Who was it?

94
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,400
A ghost?

95
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,640
Jim didn't believe in ghosts, but who was the girl at the window?


96
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,120
She looked down at him.

97
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,200
He continued looking at the window.

98
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,840
Suddenly the face of the girl disappeared.

99
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,000
Jim could not see well because it was very foggy.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,040
He decided to go home quickly.

101
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,880
He walked in the door and into the living room.

102
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,720
He saw his grandfather in the corner of the room.

103
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,760
'Grandpa!' he cried 'I saw a ghost!'

104
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,880
'What did you say?' asked his grandfather with a smile.

105
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,440
'I saw the face of a little girl at the window of the old mansion.


106
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,040
No one lives there, but I saw a girl.

107
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,480
She looked at me!'

108
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,960
'Are you sure, Jim?

109
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
It's a very foggy afternoon.

110
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,240
Did you see her clearly?

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,280
No one lives in the old Stewart mansion.

112
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,320
It's about one hundred years old.

113
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,760
There's a strange story about it, but I don't think there are
any ghosts.'

114
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,720
'What story? Please tell me!'

115
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
said Jim.

116
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,560
'Well, Mr Stewart was a very rich, but very strange man.

117
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,200
He was very interested in science and experiments.

118
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,040
He had a lot of enemies.

119
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,720
People thought his experiments were mysterious and sinister.

120
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,600
His wife and daughter died in a mysterious accident.

121
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,560
It was terrible.

122
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,320
He left San Francisco and returned to New York.'

123
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,760
'I saw a face, grandpa - I did!' said Jim.

124
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,880
'But, Jim, you don't believe in ghosts,' said his grandfather.


125
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,240
'You're right - but I saw that girl's face,' said Jim.

126
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,840
'Maybe it was your imagination,' said his grandfather kindly.


127
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,720
Jim went to his room and turned on the radio.

128
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
He listened to some songs and then started doing his homework.


129
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,600
The next day Jim went to work at the supermarket.

130
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,400
It was a busy day.

131
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,960
A strange man with long hair and a silver earring came in.

132
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,480
His clothes were old.

133
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,600
Customers were usually friendly but this man was not.

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,840
He had an angry expression, paid quickly and left.

135
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,960
There was something strange about him.

136
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,920
When Jim went home that evening he phoned Brian.

137
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,760
'Hi.

138
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
How was your day?'

139
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,960
'Very busy,' said Brian.

140
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,800
'Yes, mine too.

141
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,040
Do you want to see that new science fiction movie on at The Big
Screen movie theater?

142
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,040
We can meet at 7 p.m. in front of the park,' said Jim.

143
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,000
'OK.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,840
I'll see you then,' said Brian, 'at Washington Square.'

145
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,200
'Don't be late.'

146
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,600
Jim left the house and started walking to the park.

147
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,080
He stopped in front of the gate of the old Stewart mansion again.


148
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,000
There was no one at the window.

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,720
He stayed there a few minutes.

150
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,600
It was windy and the big trees in the garden made strange noises.


151
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,120
He looked at his watch.

152
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
It was nearly seven o'clock.

153
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,520
He was late to meet Brian.

154
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,040
CHAPTER THREE

155
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,480
The Stewart Mansion

156
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,400
After the movies the two boys went to eat an ice-cream at Pier
39.

157
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,240
It was a beautiful night.

158
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,520
They stopped and looked at Alcatraz Island in the middle of San
Francisco Bay.

159
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,400
Jim told Brian about the face at the window.

160
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,520
'What?' said Brian.

161
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,840
'I don't believe it.

162
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,200
I want to come with you next week.

163
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,960
I want to see her too.'

164
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,840
'Really?

165
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,600
That's great!' said Jim.

166
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,960
'It's a strange place.

167
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,560
I'm always a little afraid when I go alone.

168
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,280
Let's go together soon.'

169
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,960
On Monday after school the two friends met Susan at the bus stop.


170
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,560
They got on the bus.

171
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,240
'Where are you going?' Susan asked.

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,320
'Can you keep a secret?' asked Jim.

173
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,280
'Why?

174
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,040
Do you have a secret?' asked Susan.

175
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,200
'Yes, I do,' said Jim.

176
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,040
'Is it about Jenny Lee's new boyfriend?' asked Susan.

177
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,400
Jenny was a very popular girl in their class.

178
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,640
Susan hoped Jenny Lee's new boyfriend wasn't Jim.

179
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,040
He told her about the Stewart mansion and about the face at the
window.

180
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:51,200
Then he told his friends his grandfather's story about the mansion,
the scientist and the mysterious accident.

181
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,840
'Scary!' said Susan.

182
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
'Old mansions always have ghosts.

183
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,320
Can I come with you?'

184
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,560
Jim smiled at her and said, Of course, but promise not to tell
anyone.'

185
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,200
Jim was happy that Susan wanted to come.

186
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,800
Susan was pretty.

187
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,840
'Hey, come on, it's our stop,' said Brian.

188
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,280
'Let's get off.'

189
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,600
It was 4.30 p.m. and it was a cold, sunny afternoon.

190
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,400
The three friends walked up Telegraph Hill.

191
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,840
When they arrived at the Stewart mansion they stopped in front
of the old gate.

192
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,960
'What a strange place,' said Susan.

193
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,720
'It's cool!' said Brian.

194
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,000
They looked at the window on the second floor but they saw nothing.


195
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,680
They started talking and looking around.

196
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,920
'Hey, do you smell anything strange?' said Susan.

197
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,960
They stopped and smelled the air.

198
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,480
There was a very bad smell in the air.

199
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,200
'What is that smell?' asked Brian.

200
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
'I don't know.

201
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,840
It smells like rotten eggs!' said Jim.

202
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,280
'Yes, that's true. But where is it coming from?' asked Brian.


203
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,560
Susan and Br an looked at Jim.

204
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,280
Then they looked at the window on the second floor again.

205
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,000
'Are you sure you saw a face, Jim?' asked Susan.

206
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,840
Jim didn't know what to say.

207
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,120
There was no one at the window now.

208
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,000
'This is a scary place but I don't see any ghosts,' said Brian.


209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,920
'This smell is terrible,' said Susan.

210
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,400
'Let's go home and forget about the ghost.

211
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,120
It was probably your imagination, Jim.

212
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,960
'Look!' cried Jim.

213
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,320
'There's yellow smoke over there.'

214
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Near the bottom window of the mansion they saw strange yellow
smoke in the air.

215
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
'Wow!

216
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,000
You're right,' said Susan.

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,920
'What's happening here?' said Brian.

218
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,960
'It smells like a dead body.

219
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,520
Maybe there's a dead body in the mansion!

220
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,040
Maybe this is a secret cemetery,' said Jim.

221
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,200
Brian's face became white.

222
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,360
The three friends looked at each other.

223
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,760
'A secret cemetery?' they said softly.

224
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,440
They were curious but terrified at the same time.

225
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,240
No one knew what to say.

226
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,800
'Oh, please let's go home.

227
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,480
This place frightens me,' said Susan.

228
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,080
'There's something strange happening here,' said Brian.

229
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,280
They agreed to leave, and went to Jim's house to listen to his
new CDs.

230
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,440
They sat in Jim's room and talked about the mansion.

231
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,600
Then Susan suddenly said, 'Hey, there's the big Chinese New Year
parade this Saturday night.

232
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm taking the Moreno children.'

233
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,000
'It's always lots of fun,' said Jim.

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,280
'I'm going to go.'

235
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,200
'Me too,' said Brian.

236
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,160
CHAPTER FOUR

237
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,440
Chinese New Year

238
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,960
This was the Year of the Dragon.

239
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,160
The Chinese believe that the dragon brings good luck.

240
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,360
The Chinese New Year Parade is a very big event in San Francisco.


241
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,960
It always takes place on a Saturday night between January 21
and February 19.

242
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,640
The date depends on the position of the moon.

243
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,000
Thousands of people go to see the parade every year.

244
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,400
There are many beautiful costumes, Chinese music and Grant Avenue
is decorated with colorful lanterns.

245
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
A long paper dragon moves along Grant Avenue.

246
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,320
There are firecrackers and lots of noise.

247
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,760
Jim and Brian took the cable car to Grant Avenue.

248
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,400
It was always fun to ride the cable car.

249
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,000
Susan and their high school friends were at the parade.

250
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,600
Jenny Lee was there with her new boyfriend.

251
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,160
He was the captain of the football team and he was handsome.

252
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,760
There was a big crowd everywhere.

253
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,600
Suddenly, on the other side of the street Jim saw the face of
the little girl at the window in the crowd.

254
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,720
Jim told Brian.

255
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,520
'Let's follow her,' said Brian.

256
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,240
It was difficult to move because there were lots of people everywhere.


257
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,560
Then the big paper dragon appeared in the parade.

258
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,000
The little girl suddenly disappeared behind the long dragon.

259
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,600
'How can anyone disappear so quickly?' said Jim.

260
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,080
They went back to watch the parade.

261
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,560
'Maybe she is a ghost,' he thought.

262
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,280
The weekend passed quickly.

263
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,080
It was Monday morning and they were at school.

264
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,800
Brian and Jim told Susan about the girl.

265
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,320
Now she wanted to explore the Stewart mansion too.

266
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,360
They made plans during lunch.

267
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
'Let's go this evening after dinner.

268
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,240
Remember to bring a flashlight and wear dark clothes,' said Jim.


269
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,080
They were very excited.

270
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,120
When school finished at 3:15 p.m. they ran out.

271
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,040
They wanted to go home quickly.

272
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,520
At about 7 p.m. they met in front of Jim's house on Telegraph
Hill.

273
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,040
When they arrived at the Stewart mansion everything was dark.


274
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,320
It was a foggy, windy night.

275
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,320
They looked at the window on the second floor, but there was
no one there.

276
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,480
They climbed over the fence and went into the garden.

277
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,160
The tall trees moved in the wind.

278
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,440
'I don't smell anything this time,' said Susan.

279
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,680
'Me neither,' agreed Jim.

280
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,040
'And now what do we do?' asked Brian.

281
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,600
'I don't know,' said Jim.

282
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,080
Let's look inside.

283
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,840
here are windows near the ground, said Susan.

284
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,160
'And let's remember to be very quiet,' she whispered.

285
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,240
'OK,' said Jim.

286
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,400
The three friends went to a window and looked inside.

287
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,360
The glass was old and dirty.

288
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,800
Brian turned on his flashlight and looked.

289
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,080
There was a small room with an old desk and some chairs.

290
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,880
'This was probably the study,' said Brian.

291
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,160
Susan turned on her flashlight.

292
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,400
'Look at the newspaper on the desk,' said Susan.

293
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,520
'I can't see well, but it I think it's yesterday's newspaper.


294
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,560
Look at the headline: 'Water scarce in San Francisco.'

295
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,880
'But no one lives here,' said Jim.

296
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,800
They looked inside another window and saw a big room with old
furniture.

297
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,400
It looked like the living room.

298
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,640
On the wall there was a big painting of a man, a woman and a
little girl.

299
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,520
'Look, that's probably a painting of the Stewart family,' said
Susan.

300
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,240
'Yes, before the mysterious accident,' said Jim.

301
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,960
'And the little girl has long, dark hair.

302
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,360
She looks like the girl at the window,' said Susan.

303
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,040
'But we saw the little girl at the parade,' said Brian.

304
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,840
'How can she be a ghost?'

305
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,040
'Remember, she disappeared behind the dragon very quickly,' said
Jim.

306
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,560
They went to the other side of the mansion.

307
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,520
There was a broken window near the bottom of the house.

308
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,960
They looked inside.

309
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,080
They saw a big dark basement.

310
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,560
No one was there.

311
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,800
Then Jim turned on his flashlight too.

312
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,480
In the basement they saw some long tables.

313
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,040
There were test tubes, glass bottles and other laboratory equipment.


314
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,640
'This looks like our chemistry lab,' said Jim.

315
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,640
'Maybe someone is using it,' said Susan.

316
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,920
'But why?'

317
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,880
'Maybe someone is experimenting... with something secret,' said
Brian.

318
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,760
'I don't like this place,' said Susan.

319
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,880
'It gives me a bad feeling.

320
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,360
'Are you scared?' asked Brian.

321
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,800
'No, I want to come back again, but in the daytime,' said Susan.


322
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,680
'OK,' said Jim.

323
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,000
'Let's go then.'

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,120
Crash!

325
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
There was a loud noise.

326
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,760
It came from one of the rooms upstairs.

327
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,240
'What was that?' cried Susan.

328
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,760
'We're not alone here.

329
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,360
Someone or something is here,' said Jim.

330
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,920
'Let's get out of here!' said Brian.

331
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,960
They started running to the fence.

332
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,760
They ran under the trees and suddenly heard a strange sound from
the branches above their heads.

333
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,880
They looked up.

334
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,960
'Eek!' cried Susan.

335
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,160
'Bats!'

336
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,840
They climbed over the fence quickly and ran away.

337
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,160
CHAPTER FIVE

338
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,760
A Mysterious Magician

339
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,000
Jim heard the voice of a child in the fog.

340
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
'Help!

341
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,840
Help!'

342
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,760
It was a cold night Jim stood in front of the Stewart mansion.


343
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
There was fog everywhere.

344
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,600
The voice came from inside the mansion.

345
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,160
He didn't know what to do.

346
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,360
He wanted to help the child, but he also wanted to run away.

347
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,480
Suddenly he felt a hand on his arm.

348
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,120
For a moment his heart stopped.

349
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,920
He could not turn around.

350
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,560
He was too scared.

351
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,160
An angry voice behind him said, 'What do you want?'

352
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,200
Jim turned around slowly.

353
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,000
He saw a big mar with long, dark hair and angry eyes.

354
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,880
'It's the same man I saw at the supermarket two weeks ago,' he
thought.

355
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,040
He was about fifty years old.

356
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,360
He had a silver tooth and it shone in the dark.

357
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,560
He also had a silver earring.

358
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,960
He was awful.

359
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,600
'Well, what do you want here?'

360
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,240
Jim looked at him and said, 'Noth... nothing...

361
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,760
Who are you?'

362
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,680
'Don't ask questions.

363
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,360
Stay away from here.

364
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,120
I'm a dangerous man.

365
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,560
I eliminate problems and you're a problem.

366
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,840
Go away now.'

367
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,920
He pushed Jim to the ground and disappeared in the fog.

368
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,280
Jim woke up.

369
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,760
He was scared.

370
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,920
'Phew!

371
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,080
It was only a dream,' he thought.

372
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,040
He looked at his alarm clock.

373
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,760
It was 3 a.m.

374
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,080
The next day Jim, Brian and Susan went back to the mansion in
the afternoon.

375
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,280
They went to the basement window.

376
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,880
No one was there.

377
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,920
But there was a big black book on one of the tables.

378
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,040
'Someone was here last night or this morning.

379
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,720
There's a book on the table.

380
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,160
It wasn't here last night,' said Jim.

381
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,400
'You're right!' said Brian.

382
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,000
'And who has the keys to the mansion?' asked Susan.

383
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,640
'That's a good question,' said Brian.

384
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,840
The days passed and something else happened.

385
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,480
The grass in Washington Square was green again and there were
flowers!

386
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,320
Everyone in the neighborhood was surprised and happy.

387
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,800
Jim talked with his grandfather about this.

388
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,120
'Grandpa, it's amazing.

389
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,720
Washington Square is beautiful again.

390
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,400
The grass and the flowers are growing.

391
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,720
But how?

392
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,080
There's no rain.

393
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,560
How can grass and flowers grow without water?' said Jim.

394
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
'You're right.

395
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,000
It's strange.

396
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,680
There's no rain but the grass is growing,' said Grandpa.

397
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,480
'There's an article in today's newspaper about it.'

398
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,160
Jim started reading.

399
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,800
Washington Square: who is the magician?

400
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,480
The grass and flowers are growing again in Washington Square.


401
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,400
The square was dry for months but now it is beautiful and green.


402
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:29,720
The organizer of the Jazz Festival, Mike Murphy, says, 'I thought it wasn't possible to have the
Jazz Festival this year, but now it's beautiful and we can have the festival as we always do.

403
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,960
Artists from all over California are coming this year.'

404
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,880
Some people believe something mysterious is happening in Washington
Square.

405
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,480
One person said.

406
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,160
'There's no rain, but the grass and the flowers are growing.

407
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,320
I don't believe in magic, but it's very strange.'

408
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,840
Who is the magician?

409
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,720
Mr Magician, can you bring San Francisco some rain too?

410
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,400
CHAPTER SIX

411
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,200
The Game

412
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,480
One afternoon Susan took the Moreno children to Washington Square.


413
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,680
They played in the small playground.

414
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,600
Then they went to the duck pond.

415
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,280
The children liked feeding the ducks in the pond.

416
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,360
But the ducks were not hungry.

417
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,280
'Susie, why aren't the ducks eating the bread?' asked little
Sally Moreno.

418
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,320
'I don't know.

419
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,760
It's strange.

420
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,280
They're usually hungry.

421
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,160
The fish aren't hungry either, said Susan.

422
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,760
'Well, it's half past five and it's time to go home.'

423
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,720
The next morning there was a big crowd at Washington Square.

424
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,200
Jim, Brian and Susan were there with many other people.

425
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,440
Everyone was at the duck pond.

426
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,840
Some of the ducks were dead and others were sick.

427
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Lots of fish were dead too.

428
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,760
'This is terrible,' said Susan.

429
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,000
'Someone poisoned those poor ducks,' said Jim.

430
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,680
At that moment the bus came and the students got on.

431
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,640
On the bus everyone continued talking about the ducks.

432
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,920
Early the next morning Jim's grandfather bought the newspaper.


433
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,920
During breakfast this is what they read:

434
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,680
Dead ducks at popular City Square

435
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,800
Eight ducks and many fish were found dead in the pond in Washington
Square yesterday morning.

436
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,360
Only last week people came to see the Jazz Festival.

437
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,960
It was a great success.

438
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,040
A scientist analyzed the grass and the water in the pond, and
found a high quantity of a new chemical.

439
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,240
'The new chemical is similar to Greenex, but it is more toxic.


440
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,480
Greenex was a popular fertilizer twenty years ago.

441
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,560
It is illegal to use it today,' the scientist said.

442
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,920
The volunteer organization Helping Hands is now looking after
the sick ducks.

443
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:44,400
Volunteers can call this number: 392-0369.

444
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,520
The San Francisco Police Department are investigating the case.


445
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,400
'Wow!' exclaimed Jim.

446
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,960
'This mysterious new chemical is responsible for the green grass.


447
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,440
So someone created a new fertilizer and it's toxic.'

448
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,320
'What irresponsible people,' said Jim's grandfather.

449
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,760
'Think of the children.

450
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,920
They play in Washington Square.'

451
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,480
On Thursday evening Jim and Brian were at Susan's house.

452
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,800
'This fertilizer thing is so strange.

453
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,080
Maybe it's a mad scientist,' said Brian.

454
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,200
'Maybe they can make a lot of money with this new fertilizer,'
said Jim.

455
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,080
'Yes, a lot of money.

456
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,320
And they'll poison all the animals,' said Brian.

457
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,920
Susan was quiet for a few minutes, then she said, 'I want to
solve this mystery.

458
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,640
I think there's a connection between the Stewart mansion and
this fertilizer, but I don't I know...'

459
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,200
On Friday evening Susan went to see her brother's football game.


460
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,160
It was San Francisco University versus Monterey University.

461
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,000
Tom was a good player.

462
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,560
The stadium was almost full.

463
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,000
Susan found a good seat to watch the game.

464
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,920
Susan liked football games.

465
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,680
She always went to watch her brother play.

466
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,400
It was a cold night and she put her hands in her pockets.

467
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,720
'I'm glad I have a warm jacket,' she thought.

468
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,840
Then she looked at her watch.

469
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,760
It was almost half past eight.

470
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,480
It was time for the big game to start.

471
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,120
She was excited.

472
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,480
Suddenly two people behind her started talking about Washington
Square.

473
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,120
But she could not hear all of their conversation because there
was lots of noise.

474
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,680
She listened carefully.

475
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,360
'...can't test anymore ... not now...' said one young woman.

476
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,800
'...too dangerous...' said the other.

477
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,920
'These people know something,' thought Susan.

478
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,320
She continued listening but she did not look at them.

479
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,880
'...it's illegal... but the experiment... almost finished...'
said one voice.

480
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,560
'...alright... on Lombard Street...' said the other voice.

481
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,240
'Lombard Street!

482
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,840
The Stewart mansion is on Lombard Street.

483
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,480
So there is a connection between the mansion and Washington Square,'
Susan thought.

484
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,160
Suddenly she understood.

485
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,480
'I must tell Jim and Brian,' she thought.

486
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,120
She was very excited and looked at her watch.

487
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,280
The game finished on time and San Francisco University won.

488
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,520
After the game she phoned Jim.

489
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,120
She told him about the conversation between the two young women.


490
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,320
'You're a great detective Susan.

491
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,480
You're right.

492
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,800
It's that secret laboratory,' said Jim.

493
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,880
'Let's tell police immediately,' said Susan.

494
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,840
'Yes, that's the right thing to do.

495
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,600
Tomorrow's Saturday.

496
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,440
Let's meet early in the morning,' said Jim, 'I'll call the supermarket
and tell them I can't work.'

497
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,560
'OK,' said Susan.

498
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,320
I'll call Brian now.'

499
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,880
'It was lucky I went to Tom's football game,' she thought.

500
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,200
CHAPTER SEVEN

501
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,360
The Police Station

502
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,360
On Saturday morning Jim, Brian and Susan went to Chinatown Police
Station.

503
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,120
'Good afternoon,' Brian said to the policeman at the door.

504
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,080
'What can I do for you?' asked the policeman.

505
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,280
'We want to report something,' said Brian.

506
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,880
'Come to my office and sit down, said the policeman.

507
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,560
'I'm Sergeant Chan.'

508
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,400
They explained everything to Sergeant Chan.

509
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,480
He was interested and a little surprised.

510
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,440
'Why were you at the Stewart mansion?' asked Sergeant Chan.

511
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,760
'One day I saw the face of a little girl at the window,' said
Jim.

512
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,400
'I told my friends and we wanted to explore it.'

513
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,600
'Did you see anyone inside this 'secret lab?' asked Sergeant
Chan.

514
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,760
'No, we didn't,' said Jim.

515
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,680
'I understand,' said Sergeant Chan.

516
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,840
'The mansion is very close to Washington Square.

517
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,920
Perhaps you discovered something interesting that night.

518
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,280
I'll send some officers to investigate.

519
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,160
I want you to come too.

520
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,200
You know where the laboratory is.

521
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,480
I'll phone you'

522
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,440
'Yes, Sergeant,' answered Jim.

523
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,400
In the afternoon the phone rang at Jim's house.

524
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,560
'Hello, this is Sergeant Chan of the San Francisco Police Department.


525
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,600
May I speak to Jim Reilly?'

526
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,480
'This is Jim Reilly.

527
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,080
Hello Sergeant Chan.'

528
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,200
'Jim, my officers and I are going to investigate the Stewart
mansion.

529
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,960
Can we meet you at 5 o'clock this afternoon?'

530
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,200
'Of course.

531
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,760
Let's meet in front of my house at 325 Lombard Street.

532
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,480
Then we can go together,' said Jim.

533
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,200
'You and your friends wait outside your house.

534
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,640
We'll go in a police car, said Sergeant Chan.

535
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,680
'We'll see you at 5 o'clock then.

536
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,600
Goodbye.'

537
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,040
Jim was excited.

538
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,680
He told his grandfather about the phone call.

539
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,200
'I'm very proud of you and your friends.

540
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,480
You're doing the right thing,' said his grandfather.

541
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,080
He smiled, but he was worried.

542
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,480
'Thanks, grandpa.'

543
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,880
Jim called Brian and Susan.

544
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,040
'Meet me outside my house.

545
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,360
The police are going to drive us to the mansion.'

546
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,960
It was 5 p.m.

547
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,000
Jim saw two police cars in front of his house.

548
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,960
He and his friends got into the police car with Sergeant Chan.


549
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,240
'Good evening.

550
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,880
This is Sergeant Lopez,' said Sergeant Chan.

551
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,920
'Pleased to meet you, sir,' said Jim, Brian and Susan.

552
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,960
'Now this is our plan.

553
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,640
We'll drive to the mansion and my officers and I will go in.

554
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,760
Jim, you will show us the basement window.

555
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,760
After that you must stay outside the mansion.

556
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,120
Only the police will enter because it can be dangerous.

557
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,480
Do you understand?'

558
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,760
'Yes I do sir, I'll wait outside with my friends,' said Jim.

559
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,840
The police car drove up Telegraph Hill.

560
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:41,920
When they arrived in front of the Stewart mansion, Jim, Sergeant
Chan and Sergeant Lopez got out of the car.

561
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,600
Three policemen got out of the second car.

562
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,480
The five men followed Jim.

563
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,440
He took them to the gate.

564
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,280
The policeman looked around.

565
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:55,920
'You go around the back of the house and we'll go around the
front,' said Sergeant Chan to the other policemen.

566
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,000
'Where did you see this laboratory?' Sergeant Chan asked Jim.


567
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,120
'Over there by the window,' replied Jim.

568
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,000
They saw yellow smoke near the basement window.

569
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,920
There was a bad smell like before.

570
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,680
'That's the smell of sulphur,' said Sergeant Chan.

571
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,400
'And it's very strong.'

572
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,520
He opened the gate and went in.

573
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,560
The other policemen followed him.

574
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,400
Jim remained outside with his friends and waited.

575
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,880
CHAPTER EIGHT

576
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,480
The Secret Formula

577
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,240
There were four young people in the laboratory, two women and
two men.

578
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,960
They were in their early twenties and they were very busy with
an experiment.

579
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,880
They stood around the long table.

580
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,680
One woman wrote something in the big black book.

581
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,240
The other three worked with the test tubes.

582
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,080
There was a portable computer on a small desk.

583
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,400
Near the desk there was a little girl.

584
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,000
The little girl was with the man with long hair and a silver
earring.

585
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,200
Sergeant Chan looked inside the basement window and saw people
in the laboratory.

586
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,000
'Jim Reilly was right.

587
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,480
There is an illegal laboratory here.

588
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,040
Let's go in!' said Sergeant Chan to his men.

589
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,640
The police broke the front door and went into the mansion.

590
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,680
They immediately went to the basement.

591
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,560
'This is the San Francisco Police Department!

592
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,400
Put your hands over your heads,' Sergeant Lopez cried.

593
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,560
'You have the right to remain silent.

594
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,320
Anything you say can be used against you...'

595
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,440
The young people were surprised and angry.

596
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,520
'Oh, no!' cried one young man.

597
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,560
He and his friend ran to another door but the police stopped
them.

598
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,440
'Who are you and what are you doing here?

599
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,600
Do you know you are on private property?' said Sergeant Chan.


600
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,560
One of the young women spoke.

601
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,440
She was very nervous.

602
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,400
'My name is Barbara Dell.

603
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,080
We aren't criminals.

604
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,360
We're students at San Francisco University in the Department
of Chemistry.'

605
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,120
'Who's that man? He doesn't look like a student,' said Sergeant
Chan.

606
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,000
'He's Ben Bradley.

607
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,160
He has the key to the mansion because his grandfather was a gardener
here many years ago.

608
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,080
Now Ben doesn't have a home.

609
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,440
He sleeps here at night.' said Barbara Dell.

610
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,680
'Oh, shut up!' said Ben Bradley angrily.

611
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,720
'Be quiet!' said Sergeant Chan.

612
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,560
'Now continue your story.'

613
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,360
'Don't tell them anything, Barbara!' cried one of the young men.


614
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,480
'The formula is our secret.'

615
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,360
'I want to tell the truth,' said Barbara.

616
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,240
'We discovered a new molecule at the university.

617
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,880
With this molecule we created a new formula for a powerful fertilizer.


618
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,760
People can use this fertilizer without water.

619
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,280
We knew that no one lived in this mansion.

620
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:46,680
And we knew that there was an old laboratory in the basement
because Mr Stewart was a scientist.

621
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,040
We wanted to keep this a secret because...'

622
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,800
'Because you wanted to sell it to a company and make a lot of
money.

623
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,160
And you tested the fertilizer in Washington Square.

624
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,200
You polluted the water of the duck pond.

625
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,440
You killed the ducks and the fish.

626
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,680
Your new fertilizer is toxic and very dangerous.

627
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,880
Do you know that children play in the park near the duck pond?'


628
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,400
asked Sergeant Chan angrily.

629
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,520
'We didn't want to pollute the water in the pond or the grass
in the park,' said one of the young men.

630
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,360
'We just wanted to test the new fertilizer.'

631
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,400
'And you decided to test it in a public park!

632
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,640
Didn't you think about the people and the wildlife?

633
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,760
You four must come with us to the Police Station,' said Sergeant
Chan.

634
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,680
'We will also take all the chemicals you are using in this laboratory.'


635
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,600
The little girl at the desk was scared and started crying.

636
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,560
She ran to Barbara Dell.

637
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,520
'Who is she?' asked Sergeant Lopez.

638
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,360
'She's my little sister.

639
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,200
I bring her here sometimes,' said Barbara.

640
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,680
Then the policemen, the university students and Ben Bradley came
out of the mansion.

641
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,720
Jim, Brian and Susan were outside.

642
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,120
When Jim saw Ben Bradley he was very surprised.

643
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,800
'It's the man from the supermarket,' he thought.

644
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,520
The little girl looked at Jim.

645
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,280
'Well, she's not a ghost.

646
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,880
She's real,' he thought.

647
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,280
Sergeant Chan smiled at Jim, Brian and Susan and said, 'You helped
us a lot.

648
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,480
Thank you.

649
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Come to the Police Station tomorrow and I'll explain everything.


650
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,760
Thank you again.'

651
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,280
The police cars drove away.

652
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,200
The next day the three friends went to talk to Sergeant Chan.


653
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,520
'Those university students were very intelligent,' said Jim.

654
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,880
'They created a new formula.'

655
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,480
'Yes, but they were also very irresponsible.

656
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,840
We found many illegal chemicals in that basement.

657
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,600
Those chemicals are very toxic.

658
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,640
Now we must close Washington Square for a few weeks.

659
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,240
There will be a lot of work for our chemical experts,' said Sergeant
Chan.

660
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,040
'What will happen to the university students?' asked Susan.

661
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,960
'There will be a trial,' said Sergeant Chan.

662
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,360
'They could go to prison.'

663
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,400
'How are the other ducks?' asked Br an.

664
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,320
'The volunteers at Helping Hands are looking after them.

665
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,360
They're feeling better,' said Sergeant Chan.

666
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,800
Jim, Brian and Susan left the police station.

667
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,440
They were all happy.

668
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,920
'Pizza for everyone tonight,' said Jim

669
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,080
'Great idea,' said Brain.

670
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,720
'Let's go to Nico's Pizza Place on Washington Square,' said Susan.


671
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Jim and Brian looked worried.

672
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,941
'Don't worry, I'm only joking,' said Susan laughing.
