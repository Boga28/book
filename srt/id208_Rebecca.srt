CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,200
Meet Maxim de Winter

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,640
What would I be today if I had not gone to
Monte Carlo with Mrs Van Hopper?

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,560
I would have lived another life.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,880
I would have become a different person.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,320
Mrs Van Hopper was not a pleasant woman.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,120
She loved to meet people who were rich and
famous.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,960
Every summer, Mrs Van Hopper stayed at the
Hotel Cote d'Azur, the biggest and most expensive

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,160
hotel in Monte Carlo.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,720
Here, Mrs Van Hopper found out which well-known
people were staying in the town.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,360
She always found an excuse to speak to them.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,520
Then, pretending to know them well, she asked
her victims rude questions in her loud American

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,020
voice.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,160
I was young and shy.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,200
I hated my life with Mrs Van Hopper, but she
paid me a little money to be her companion.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,040
I was not exactly a servant and certainly
not a friend.

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,760
We must have looked a strange pair as we walked
into the hotel restaurant that day.

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,280
Mrs Van Hopper walked in front of me on her
high-heeled shoes.

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,880
Her fat, heavy body swayed above her short
fat legs.

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,800
I followed slowly, my eyes looking down at
the floor.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,840
With my straight hair and badly-fitting clothes
I looked like an awkward schoolgirl.

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,280
Mrs Van Hopper sat down at her usual table
and stared at everyone in the restaurant.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,640
'There isn't one well-known person here,'
she said in her loud voice.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,840
'There's no one I want to talk to.'

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,080
Mrs Van Hopper was very greedy.

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,840
She ordered a large lunch for herself.

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,720
Soon she was eating a large plateful of spaghetti.

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,640
We ate in silence.

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,680
The rich sauce ran down Mrs Van Hopper's chin.

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,320
I looked away.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,120
Then I saw that a new guest was sitting down
at the next table.

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,200
Mrs Van Hopper saw him too.

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,080
She put down her fork and stared at him hard.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,200
How an excited look come into her small eyes.

35
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,800
'It's Max de Winter,' she said to me.

36
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,720
'The man who owns Manderley.

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,040
You must have heard of it - a beautiful old
house in the west of England.

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
He looks ill, doesn't he?

39
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,200
His wife died suddenly last year.

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
They say he's broken hearted.'

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840
I felt sorry for de Winter already.

42
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
He was Mrs Van Hopper's next victim.

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,440
She finished her meal as quickly as possible.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
I knew what she was going to do.

45
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,800
There was a long seat in the hotel lounge,
with a low table in front of it.

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,240
The seat was between the restaurant and the
main door of the hotel.

47
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,680
Everyone who left the restaurant had to walk
past this seat.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,320
'I'll take my coffee in the lounge,' Mrs Van
Hopper told the waiter, 'straight away.'

49
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,840
She turned to me, her eyes shining: 'Go upstairs
and find that letter from my nephew, Billy.

50
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,720
Bring it to me in the lounge and the photographs
too.

51
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
Billy met Max de Winter in London.

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,000
Be quick.'

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,640
I went up to Mrs Van Hopper's rooms as slowly
as I could.

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,840
I hoped that de Winter would get away before
I returned.

55
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,880
When I came back with the letter, Mrs Van
Hopper was already on the seat in the lounge.

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,120
De Winter was sitting next to her.

57
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,520
He was a dark-haired, handsome man.

58
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,760
His face was pale and his dark eyes had a
sad, lost look.

59
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,520
De Winter stood up politely as I gave Mrs
Van Hopper her letter.

60
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
'Mr de Winter is having coffee with us.

61
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,640
Go and ask the waiter for another cup,' Mrs
Van Hopper told me.

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,240
'No, you are my guests,' said de Winter.

63
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,760
He called the waiter.

64
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,520
In a moment, de Winter was sitting on a small
chair and I was next to Mrs Van Hopper on

65
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,240
the long seat.

66
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,240
'I recognized you at once,' Mrs Van Hopper
said.

67
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,120
'I met you at my nephew's party, in London.

68
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,480
But I don't suppose you remember an old woman
like me?'

69
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,320
And Mrs Van Hopper gave de Winter one of her
biggest smiles.

70
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,840
'You are wrong, I could never forget you,'
said de Winter in a cold, hard voice.

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,480
'Billy's on holiday now,' Mrs Van Hopper went
on.

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,080
'He loves travelling.

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,440
But if he had a home like Manderley, he would
never leave it.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,600
People say that Manderley's one of the most
beautiful houses in England.

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,480
I wonder what you are doing here in Monte
Carlo?'

76
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
For a few moments there was silence.

77
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,080
Then de Winter spoke.

78
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
'Manderley was looking very lovely when I
came away.'

79
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,720
There was another silence.

80
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,920
De Winter had not answered Mrs Van Hopper's
question.

81
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,960
She was not silent for long, of course.

82
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,400
She started to tell de Winter all the unpleasant
gossip of Monte Carlo.

83
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,040
After his moment of rudeness, de Winter listened
to her politely.

84
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,040
I looked down at the floor and tried not to
hear Mrs Van Hopper's loud voice.

85
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
At last she had to stop.

86
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,840
A waiter came up to her with a message.

87
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,640
Mrs Van Hopper's dressmaker was waiting for
her upstairs.

88
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,720
De Winter stood up at once.

89
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,160
'You mustn't keep your dressmaker waiting,'
he said.

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
Mrs Van Hopper smiled.

91
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,960
'You must have a drink with me,' she said.

92
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,640
'Why not tomorrow evening?

93
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,920
I'm having a few friends...'

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,800
'I'm sorry,' de Winter said quickly.

95
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
'I shall be away all day tomorrow.

96
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,840
If you will excuse me...'

97
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,320
He turned and walked out of the lounge.

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,560
'What a strange man Max de Winter is,' said
Mrs Van Hopper when we were standing in the

99
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,280
lift.

100
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,640
'He left so suddenly.

101
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
But he is certainly an attractive man.

102
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
By the way, dear, you were rather rude to
him.

103
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,960
You must look at people when they are speaking.

104
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,400
You are not a child, you know.'

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,480
Mrs Van Hopper was soon busy with her dressmaker.

106
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,240
I sat on a window seat, looking at the bright
day outside.

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,760
I could not go out.

108
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
Some of Mrs Van Hopper's friends were coming
to tea.

109
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,120
They were fat, rude women like herself.

110
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,320
My job was to talk to them, light their cigarettes
and tidy the room after they had gone.

111
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
There was a knock on the door.

112
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,200
A waiter came in with a note in his hand.

113
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,320
'Madame is in the bedroom,' I told him.

114
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,160
But the note was for me.

115
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,280
There were a few words in an unknown handwriting.

116
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,840
'Forgive me.

117
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
I was very rude after lunch.'

118
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,840
The note was not signed, but I knew it was
from de Winter.

119
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,000
'Is there an answer?'

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,880
the waiter asked me.

121
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,160
I looked up.

122
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,220
'No.

123
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,440
No answer,' I said.

124
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
After the waiter had gone, I put the note
in my pocket.

125
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,320
Mrs Van Hopper called me from her bedroom.

126
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:33,840
I got up slowly, thinking about de Winter
and about Manderley.

127
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,400
CHAPTER TWO

128
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,440
A Day Out Together

129
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,400
The following day, Mrs Van Hopper woke up
with a sore throat and a high temperature.

130
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,280
I rang up her doctor and he came round at
once.

131
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,280
'You have flu, Madame,' the doctor told her.

132
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,160
'You won't get better unless you stay quietly
in bed.

133
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,400
Your heart isn't strong.

134
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,640
You'll need a nurse to look after you.

135
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
You must stay in bed for a week or two.'

136
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,880
'I'm sure I could look after Mrs Van Hopper,'
I said.

137
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,000
But the doctor said no.

138
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,200
To my surprise, Mrs Van Hopper agreed with
him.

139
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,080
Monte Carlo had begun to bore her.

140
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
She would enjoy staying in bed.

141
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,120
She would enjoy giving orders to the nurse
as well as to me.

142
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,880
The nurse soon arrived and I was no longer
wanted.

143
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,520
I went down to the restaurant by myself.

144
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,840
I was glad to be alone.

145
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,720
It was half an hour before our usual lunch-time.

146
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,800
The restaurant was almost empty.

147
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,880
I went to our usual table.

148
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,080
Then I saw that de Winter was already at his
table.

149
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,080
It was too late for me to go back.

150
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,520
I sat down awkwardly trying not to look at
him.

151
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,760
As I picked up the menu, I knocked over the
flowers on the table.

152
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,520
The water went all over the cloth and ran
down on to my skirt.

153
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,720
The waiter was at the other end of the restaurant
and saw nothing.

154
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,680
In a moment, de Winter was standing by my
chair.

155
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,800
'You can't sit here now,' he said.

156
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
He called to the waiter who came up at once.

157
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,120
'Lay another place at my table,' de Winter
said.

158
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,480
'This lady is lunching with me.'

159
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
'Oh no,' I said.

160
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,600
'I couldn't...'

161
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
'Why not?' he said.

162
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,840
'I want you to have lunch with me.

163
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,280
I was going to ask you anyway.

164
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,800
Come and sit down.

165
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,040
You needn't talk if you don't want to.'

166
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,760
We ordered our food and sat for a time in
a pleasant, easy silence.

167
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,640
'What's happened to your friend?'

168
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,600
de Winter asked me.

169
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
I told him about Mrs Van Hopper's illness.

170
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
'I'm sorry,' he said politely.

171
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,840
'You got my note, I suppose.

172
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,120
It's very kind of you to lunch with me after
my rudeness.'

173
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
'You were not rude,' I said.

174
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
'At least, she did not think you were.

175
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,280
She is always so curious about anyone important.'

176
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,880
'Important?

177
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,520
Why does she think that I'm important?'

178
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,320
de Winter asked.

179
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,680
'I think it's because of Manderley,' I said.

180
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,440
He did not answer.

181
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,160
I felt that he did not want to talk about
his home.

182
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,120
'Your friend is very different from you,'
he said at last.

183
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
'And she's much older than you too.

184
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,400
Is she a relation?'

185
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,920
'Mrs Van Hopper is not my friend,' I said.

186
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
'I work for her.

187
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,600
I have to, I need the money.

188
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,640
I have no family and there is nothing else
I can do.'

189
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,920
De Winter asked me more questions about myself.

190
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,320
I forgot my shyness.

191
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
I told him about my father, who had been a
painter.

192
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,320
I talked about my mother and her great love
for my father.

193
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,600
When my father had died very suddenly, my
mother had lived only a few weeks after him.

194
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,000
I suddenly realized that we had been sitting
at the table for more than an hour.

195
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,000
I began to apologize.

196
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,760
'But I've enjoyed this hour so much,' de Winter
said.

197
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
'We are alike in some ways.

198
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,920
We are both alone in the world.

199
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,400
I have a sister, but that's all.'

200
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,760
'You forget,' I told him, 'that you have a
home and I have none.'

201
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,000
'An empty house, even a very beautiful one,
can be lonely,' de Winter said.

202
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,240
I thought for a moment that he was going to
tell me about Manderley.

203
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,080
But instead he said, 'Well, I suppose you
have a holiday this afternoon.

204
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,880
What are you going to do?'

205
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,000
I told him that I was going to do some sketching.

206
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
I wanted to draw some of the old houses in
a nearby town.

207
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,520
The bus left at half past two.

208
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,880
'I'll drive you there in my car,' de Winter
said.

209
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,720
'Go upstairs and get your coat.'

210
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,840
I got my things very quietly.

211
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,760
I did not want Mrs Van Hopper to hear me.

212
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,200
I ran down the stairs, holding my gloves in
one hand.

213
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,360
I felt excited and grown-up.

214
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,840
I did not feel shy with de Winter.

215
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,320
He enjoyed my company.

216
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,240
He had asked me to go out with him in his
car.

217
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,080
We soon reached the place where I wanted to
sketch.

218
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,800
But the wind was too strong - it blew the
paper away.

219
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,880
We got into the car again and drove on, up
the steep mountain road.

220
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
Then suddenly the road came to an end.

221
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
De Winter stopped the car at the very edge.

222
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,400
Far below us lay the sea.

223
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,680
I felt cold and a little afraid.

224
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,840
'Do you know this place?'

225
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,900
I said.

226
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,480
'Have you been here before?'

227
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,080
De Winter looked at me as though I were a
stranger.

228
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,160
He was lost in the past.

229
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,600
There was a strange, faraway look on his face.

230
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
He looked like a man walking in his sleep.

231
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,480
'It's getting late, shall we go home?'

232
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:32,980
I said.

233
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,200
Then he looked at me and smiled.

234
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,920
'I'm sorry,' he said.

235
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,440
'I should not have brought you up here.

236
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,280
Yes, I have been here before, many years ago.'

237
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Those years seemed to stretch between us.

238
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,920
For the first time, I wished that I had not
come.

239
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,720
De Winter turned the car carefully, and we
drove down the twisting road again.

240
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,160
The sun was setting now and the air was cold
and clear.

241
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,320
Then, at last, he began to talk about Manderley.

242
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,400
He did not talk about his life there, but
about the house itself.

243
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,080
He told me about the gardens and the flowers
in the woods.

244
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,920
He told me about the sea.

245
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,640
It was so near that the sound of its waters
could always be heard from the house.

246
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,320
He told me about a little, secret valley close
to the sea.

247
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,920
This little valley, hidden away from the world,
was full of the scent of flowers.

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,520
Then we were back in Monte Carlo.

249
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,280
We drove slowly through the brightly lit streets
towards the hotel.

250
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
I took my gloves from the shelf of the car.

251
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,920
There was a book there.

252
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,840
I looked at it, trying to read the title.

253
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,240
'You can take the book and look at it, if
you like,' de Winter said.

254
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,920
I was glad and I held the book tightly in
my hand.

255
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,840
I wanted to have something of his now that
our day was over.

256
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,520
'Out you get,' he said, 'I must put the car
away.

257
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,520
I won't see you tonight.

258
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,240
I shall be out.

259
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,160
But thank you for today.'

260
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,440
I walked slowly up the hotel steps.

261
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,720
I felt like a child going home after a party.

262
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
I thought of the long hours to bedtime.

263
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,520
I could not meet Mrs Van Hopper and answer
the endless questions.

264
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,000
I went into the lounge and ordered tea.

265
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,840
The waiter brought me tea that was nearly
cold.

266
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,480
The sandwiches were dry, but I ate them without
thinking.

267
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,920
In my mind I was with Max de Winter at Manderley.

268
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,680
If he loved his home so much, why had he left
it?

269
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,720
I picked up the book he had given me.

270
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,560
It was a book of poems.

271
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,840
On the front page there was some writing - hard,
clear writing in black ink:

272
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,400
"Max - from Rebecca, 17th May."

273
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,080
The name Rebecca stood out black and strong.

274
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,920
The "R" was tall, much bigger than the other
letters.

275
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,920
I shut the book quickly.

276
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,600
I remembered what Mrs Van Hopper had told
me about de Winter's wife.

277
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,040
'It was dreadful,' she had said.

278
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,520
'Her death was in all the newspapers.

279
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,480
They say he never talks about it, never says
her name.

280
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,720
Rebecca was drowned, you know, in the sea
near Manderley.'

281
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,400
I stood up slowly, the book in my hand.

282
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,200
I walked unhappily to the lift and back to
Mrs Van Hopper.

283
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,680
CHAPTER THREE

284
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,240
In Love

285
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,200
I was twenty-one and de Winter was the first
man I had ever loved.

286
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,320
First love is not always happy.

287
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
It can sometimes be like a terrible illness.

288
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,840
Mrs Van Hopper had been in bed for about ten
days.

289
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,440
She was bored now, and more bad tempered than
usual.

290
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,800
She asked me what I had been doing.

291
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,320
'You haven't got enough to do and so you are
doing nothing,' she said unpleasantly.

292
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,480
'You never have any drawings to show me.

293
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,840
When I ask you to do some shopping, you always
forget something.

294
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,840
You are getting lazy without me to watch you.'

295
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,920
I did not reply.

296
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,400
I could not tell Mrs Van Hopper that every
morning I drove with de Winter in his car.

297
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,240
Every day I had lunch with him at his table.

298
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,400
I have forgotten the places we went to, but
I have not forgotten the excitement of those

299
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,900
mornings.

300
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,880
I remember how I ran down the stairs because
the lift was too slow.

301
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,160
He was always waiting in his car, reading
the paper.

302
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,480
When he saw me, he would smile and say, 'Well,
how is the companion this morning?

303
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,520
Where would you like to go?'

304
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,680
If we had driven round-in circles, I would
not have cared.

305
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,760
I was happy to sit next to him, to be alone
with him.

306
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,440
But the time always went too quickly.

307
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,920
There was a clock in the car.

308
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,000
I could not help looking at it as we drove
along.

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,400
'If only we could keep our memories like scent
in a bottle,' I said one day.

310
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,520
'And then we could open the bottle when we
wanted to remember the moment again.'

311
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,400
'And what moment would you like to keep?'

312
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,240
de Winter said with a smile.

313
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,880
'I'm not sure,' I began.

314
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,320
Then I said quickly, 'I'd like to keep this
moment and never forget it.'

315
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,760
De Winter laughed.

316
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,160
I suddenly felt very young and very silly.

317
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,240
'I wish,' I said angrily, '... I wish I was
a woman of about thirty-six.

318
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,840
I wish I was wearing a lot of make-up and
had expensive clothes.'

319
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,320
'You would not be in this car now if you were
like that,' he said.

320
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,400
'Why do you ask me to come out in your car,
day after day?'

321
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:30,900
I said.

322
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,360
'I'm young, I know nothing.

323
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,840
I am not an interesting person at all.

324
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,720
You know all about me now.

325
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,760
I have told you everything.

326
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,240
But I know nothing about you, nothing - except
that you live at Manderley and... and that

327
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,200
your wife is dead.'

328
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,160
I had said the words, at last.

329
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,520
Your wife.

330
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,880
Your wife.

331
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,440
He would never forgive me.

332
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,280
I shall never drive with him again, I thought.

333
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,720
He slowed down the car and we stopped by the
side of the road.

334
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,840
Then he turned to me and spoke.

335
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,280
'A little while ago, you said you wanted to
keep your memories.

336
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,120
For me, it is different.

337
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
All my memories are unhappy.

338
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,360
I want to forget them.

339
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,080
Something happened a year ago that changed
my whole life.

340
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,880
I want to forget everything that happened
to me before that time.

341
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,440
That's why I came to Monte Carlo.

342
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,720
If you had not been here, I would have left
long ago.

343
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,240
I ask you to drive with me because I like
you.

344
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,840
I enjoy your company.

345
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,120
If you don't believe me, you can get out of
the car now.'

346
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,000
I sat very still.

347
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,600
I could not speak.

348
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
I could feel the tears coming into my eyes.

349
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,320
'I want to go home now,' I said.

350
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,080
Without a word, he started the car and we
drove on.

351
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,120
The tears began to run down my cheeks.

352
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,320
Suddenly de Winter took my hand and kissed
it.

353
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,560
Then he gave me his handkerchief.

354
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,640
I wiped my red eyes.

355
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,040
I had never felt more alone.

356
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,240
'To hell with this,' he said and put his arm
round my shoulders.

357
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,360
'You are so young, I don't know how to speak
to you.

358
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,920
Forget everything I told you.

359
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,800
Let's start again.

360
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
My family always call me Maxim.

361
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,680
I'd like you to call me that too.'

362
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,520
I smiled then, and he laughed back at me.

363
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,760
The morning was happy again.

364
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,800
The afternoon with Mrs Van Hopper did not
matter.

365
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,160
I could look forward to tomorrow morning and
the morning after.

366
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,160
I could call him Maxim.

367
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,920
He had kissed me.

368
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,840
I had to play cards with Mrs Van Hopper that
afternoon, but I was still happy.

369
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,920
When we had finished our game, Mrs Van Hopper
said, 'Tell me, is Max de Winter still in

370
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,420
the hotel?'

371
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,020
'Yes.

372
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,520
Yes, I think so.

373
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,920
He comes into the restaurant sometimes,' I
said.

374
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,440
Someone has told her, I thought.

375
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,280
Someone has seen us together.

376
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
I waited for her to ask more questions.

377
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,040
But she did not.

378
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,920
'He's an attractive man,' she said, 'but not
easy to know.

379
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,840
I never saw his wife.

380
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,560
People say she was very lovely.

381
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,640
She was clever too, and always beautifully
dressed, of course.

382
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,320
Her death was very sudden.

383
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,240
Everyone says he adored her.'

384
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,480
I did not answer.

385
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,080
I was thinking about Rebecca - beautiful and
clever.

386
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,080
People could not forget her.

387
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,280
Somehow, she and her beauty had not died.

388
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,680
In my bedroom was a book that Rebecca had
held in her hands.

389
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,840
His family called him Maxim.

390
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,240
Rebecca had called him Max.

391
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,200
I thought of the writing on that page.

392
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,200
It was bold and full of life.

393
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,640
Rebecca was all the things that I would never
be.

394
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,840
I thought of all the letters Rebecca had written
to her husband.

395
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,800
They must have been full of the life they
had shared.

396
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,760
I thought I could hear her voice calling him.

397
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,840
She called him Max.

398
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,920
It was her special name for him.

399
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,840
And I had to call him Maxim.

400
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,840
CHAPTER FOUR

401
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,680
I Leave Monte Carlo

402
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,080
Two days later, everything had changed.

403
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,640
Mrs Van Hopper and I were ready to leave Monte
Carlo.

404
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
All the trunks and bags were packed.

405
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,280
All the drawers and cupboards were empty.

406
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,880
Mrs Van Hopper had read a letter from her
daughter at breakfast.

407
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,720
'Helen is sailing for New York on Saturday.

408
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,680
Her child's ill.

409
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,520
We are going too.

410
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,880
I'm tired of living here.

411
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,960
How would you like to see New York?'

412
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,920
The thought of leaving Monte Carlo and Maxim
de Winter was a terrible one.

413
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,640
My unhappiness must have shown on my face.

414
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,120
'What a strange child you are,' Mrs Van Hopper
said.

415
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,480
'I can't understand you.

416
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,320
I thought you didn't like Monte Carlo.'

417
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
'I've got used to it,' I said.

418
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,240
'Well, you'll have to get used to New York,
that's all.

419
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,960
We're going on the same boat as Helen.

420
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,800
You'll have to arrange everything at once.

421
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Go down to the hotel office now.

422
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,560
You will be too busy to feel unhappy.'

423
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
She laughed unpleasantly at my sad face.

424
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,840
She walked over to the telephone.

425
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,320
She wanted to tell everyone that she was leaving.

426
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
I went into the bathroom and locked the door.

427
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,160
I wanted to be alone for a few minutes.

428
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,560
My happiness was at an end.

429
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,840
By tomorrow evening, I should be on the train.

430
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
The train would carry me away from Maxim,
mile by mile.

431
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,840
He would be sitting in the restaurant, reading
perhaps and not thinking of me.

432
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,480
Where would I say goodbye to him?

433
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,840
In the lounge, with Mrs Van Hopper standing
near?

434
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,120
I was going and everything was over.

435
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
We would say goodbye like two strangers.

436
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,080
Mrs Van Hopper knocked on the bathroom door.

437
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,600
'What are you doing in there?'

438
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,560
she said.

439
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,400
'There's no time to dream this morning.

440
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,440
There's too much to be done.'

441
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,400
I washed my face with cold water and came
out of the bathroom at once.

442
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,080
I spent the rest of the day packing and arranging
the journey.

443
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,840
In the evening, Mrs Van Hopper's friends came
to say goodbye.

444
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,520
We had dinner upstairs and Mrs Van Hopper
went to bed early.

445
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,080
I had not seen Maxim all day.

446
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
I went down to the lounge at half past nine.

447
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,560
A waiter saw me.

448
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,400
He knew who I was looking for, of course.

449
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,720
'Mr de Winter is out this evening,' he told
me.

450
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,480
'He will not be back before midnight.'

451
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,680
I walked slowly back up the stairs.

452
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,680
Tomorrow would be too late.

453
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,160
I should not be able to speak to him at all.

454
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,480
That night I cried.

455
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,200
My pillow was wet with tears.

456
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,560
In the morning, my eyes were red and swollen.

457
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,680
'You haven't got a cold, have you?' said Mrs
Van Hopper when she saw my face.

458
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,200
'No,' I said, 'I don't think so.'

459
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,360
I tried not to look at her.

460
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,960
'I hate waiting around when everything is
packed,' Mrs Van Hopper said bad temperedly.

461
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,880
'We ought to have gone on the earlier train.'

462
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,480
She looked at her watch.

463
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
'I think we could still catch it.

464
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,200
Go down to the reception desk and ask.

465
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,480
Hurry up.'

466
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,240
So my last morning was to be taken away from
me.

467
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,400
I would not see Maxim.

468
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,200
Suddenly, I made up my mind.

469
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,040
Instead of going down to the reception desk,
I ran up the stairs.

470
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,200
I knew the number of his room.

471
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,080
I knocked on the door.

472
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
'Come in,' Maxim shouted.

473
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,640
I opened the door.

474
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,840
He was having breakfast at a small table in
his sitting-room.

475
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,040
I stood by the door, feeling silly and awkward.

476
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,680
'What do you want?' he said.

477
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,040
'Is something wrong?'

478
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,880
'I've come to say goodbye,' I said.

479
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,640
'We're going this morning.

480
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,840
In about an hour.

481
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,240
I thought I would not see you again.'

482
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,720
Maxim stared at me.

483
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,000
'Why didn't you tell me about this before?'
he said.

484
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,280
'Mrs Van Hopper only decided to leave yesterday.

485
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,640
Her daughter sails for New York on Saturday
and we're going with her.

486
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,400
I don't want to go.

487
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,080
I'll hate New York.'

488
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,760
'Why go there, then?'

489
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,440
'I have to.

490
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,600
I work for her, you know that.

491
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,680
I can't afford to leave her.'

492
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,240
'Sit down,' he said.

493
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,600
'Have some coffee.'

494
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,080
'I haven't time,' I told him.

495
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,360
'I should be downstairs now.'

496
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,120
'Never mind about that, I've got to talk to
you.'

497
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,840
I sat down at the table.

498
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,840
'So Mrs Van Hopper wants to go home,' said
Maxim.

499
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,480
'So do I. She goes to New York and I go to
Manderley.

500
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,400
Which do you prefer?

501
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,360
You can take your choice.'

502
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,160
'Please don't joke about it,' I said.

503
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,840
'I must say goodbye now.'

504
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,520
'I'm not joking,' said Maxim.

505
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,760
'Either you go to America with Mrs Van Hopper
or you come home to Manderley with me.'

506
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,480
'Do you want a secretary?'

507
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
I asked, not understanding him.

508
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,840
'No, I'm asking you to marry me, you little
fool.'

509
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,080
I sat with my hands in my lap, watching him
drink his coffee.

510
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,080
'You can't marry me,' I said at last.

511
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,280
'I'm different from you.

512
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
I don't belong to your kind of world.

513
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,240
I don't belong to a place like Manderley.'

514
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,920
'What do you know about Manderley?'

515
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,200
Maxim said.

516
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,120
'I want you to marry me.

517
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,400
Are you going to?'

518
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,280
I sat there, staring at him.

519
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,320
I could not think clearly.

520
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,880
'The idea doesn't seem to please you,' Maxim
said.

521
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,760
'I'm sorry, I thought you loved me.'

522
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,120
'I do love you,' I said, 'I do.

523
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,280
I've been crying all night.

524
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,000
I thought I would never see you again.'

525
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,200
When I said this, Maxim laughed and put his
hand over mine.

526
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,320
'One day I'll remind you of those words.

527
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,280
It's a pity you have to grow up,' he said.

528
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Was Maxim laughing at me?

529
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,840
Was it all a joke?

530
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
He saw the look on my face.

531
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,560
'I haven't done this very well, have I?'

532
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,680
Maxim said.

533
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,240
'Men don't usually propose at breakfast.

534
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
But I'll take you to Venice for our honeymoon.

535
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,400
We'll travel round Italy for a time.

536
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,440
Then, in the spring, we'll go back to Manderley.

537
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,920
I want to show you Manderley so much.'

538
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,760
Maxim wanted to show me Manderley.

539
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,000
Suddenly I believed everything.

540
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,320
I would be Maxim's wife.

541
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,920
We would walk in the gardens of Manderley
together.

542
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,160
We would walk through that hidden valley to
the sea.

543
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,120
Mrs de Winter - I would be Mrs de Winter.

544
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,040
'Am I going to tell Mrs Van Hopper or are
you?' said Maxim with a smile.

545
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,920
I had forgotten all about Mrs Van Hopper.

546
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,640
'You tell her,' I said.

547
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,600
'She'll be so angry.'

548
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,200
We got up from the table and walked out of
the room together.

549
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,840
Maxim took my hand.

550
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,720
'I'm forty-two,' he said.

551
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,320
'That must seem very old to you.'

552
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,200
'Oh, no,' I said.

553
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,400
'I don't like young men.'

554
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,600
I was still afraid that Maxim would change
his mind.

555
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,720
We came to the door of Mrs Van Hopper's rooms.

556
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,560
'I think I'll talk to her alone,' Maxim said.

557
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,960
'I'll tell her we are getting married very
soon.

558
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,560
We'll have a quiet wedding.

559
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,400
Everything can be arranged in a few days.'

560
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,800
'Of course,' I said.

561
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,000
'I don't want a lot of fuss.'

562
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,680
I opened the door.

563
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,440
'Is that you?'

564
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,440
called Mrs Van Hopper.

565
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,320
'Where have you been?

566
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,840
What have you been doing all this time?'

567
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,040
I did not know whether to laugh or cry.

568
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,080
Maxim walked towards the sitting-room.

569
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,160
'I'm afraid it's all my fault,' he said and
then he shut the door.

570
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,120
I went into my bedroom and waited.

571
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,640
I wondered what Maxim was saying to Mrs Van
Hopper.

572
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,520
Was he saying, 'I love her.

573
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,880
I want to marry her at once.'?

574
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,900
Love.

575
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,760
Maxim had not said anything to me about love.

576
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,080
He had said we would get married.

577
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,240
But he had not said that he loved me.

578
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,000
He had loved Rebecca, of course.

579
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,680
How could he love me, after her?

580
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
I would be a companion for him.

581
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,240
Someone to make him laugh perhaps.

582
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
The book of poems was beside me, on the bed.

583
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,040
I opened it.

584
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,200
I read again, 'Max, from Rebecca.'

585
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,280
She was dead.

586
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,000
But the writing still looked fresh and alive.

587
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,080
I took some scissors and cut the page out
of the book.

588
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,240
I tore up the page.

589
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,400
I lit a match and set fire to the pieces.

590
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,680
The paper twisted, blackened and turned to
ashes.

591
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,640
The letter "R" was the last to be burnt.

592
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,040
Then the flame destroyed it.

593
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,720
I washed my hands.

594
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,840
I felt better, much better now.

595
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,240
As I stood there, the door opened and Maxim
came in.

596
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,280
'Everything is all right,' he said.

597
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,720
'She could not speak at first.

598
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,760
She was too surprised.

599
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,840
Go in and talk to her.

600
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,640
I'm going downstairs to arrange about her
train.

601
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
I don't want her to come to the wedding.'

602
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,560
Maxim was smiling, but he said nothing about
being happy.

603
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,640
He said nothing about love.

604
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,840
I walked slowly into Mrs Van Hopper's bedroom.

605
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,800
She was standing by the window, smoking a
cigarette.

606
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,440
She turned round and looked at me carefully.

607
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,640
'Well,' she said, 'you are more clever than
I thought.

608
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,800
How did you do it?'

609
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,000
I did not know what to say.

610
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,600
Mrs Van Hopper was smiling, but there was
no kindness in her smile.

611
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,760
'It was lucky for you that I was ill,' she
said.

612
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,600
'You certainly made the most of your time.

613
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,880
He tells me that he wants to marry you in
a few days.

614
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,320
Well, I can't stop you.

615
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,960
He's much older than you, you know.'

616
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,160
'He's only forty-two,' I said.

617
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,040
'I know what I'm doing.'

618
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,120
Mrs Van Hopper looked at me again with the
same unpleasant smile.

619
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,880
'I hope you do.

620
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,080
You won't find it easy to look after Manderley.

621
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,040
You haven't any experience and you're too
shy.

622
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,720
Max de Winter is very attractive, of course.

623
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,560
But I think you're making a big mistake.'

624
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,880
I did not say anything.

625
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,360
I was young and shy, I knew that.

626
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,000
But I was going to be Mrs de Winter.

627
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,680
I was going to live at Manderley.

628
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,520
And I was going to make Maxim happy.

629
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
Mrs Van Hopper put out her cigarette.

630
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,480
She walked slowly towards me.

631
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,120
'Of course,' she said, 'you know why he is
marrying you, don't you?

632
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,960
He's not in love with you.

633
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,240
The truth is he's lonely by himself at Manderley.

634
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,200
He can't live in that empty house without
Rebecca.

635
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:49,840
He's marrying you because he can't go on living
there alone.'

636
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,880
CHAPTER FIVE

637
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,720
I Come to Manderley

638
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,720
Wе саmе to Manderley early in May.

639
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,120
It was the best time of year, before the heat
of summer.

640
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,240
When we left London, it was raining hard.

641
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,920
I remember Maxim saying, 'This is London rain.

642
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,480
The sun will be shining for you when we come
to Manderley.'

643
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,840
He was right.

644
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,600
Long before we reached Manderley, there was
blue sky over our heads.

645
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
I was glad to see the sun.

646
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,240
I welcomed it as a sign of happiness.

647
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,920
'Feeling better?' said Maxim, looking at me.

648
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,320
I smiled at him and took his hand.

649
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,120
It was so easy for Maxim.

650
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,800
He was going back to his own home.

651
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,840
But for me, everything was new and strange.

652
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,560
I was going to Manderley for the first time.

653
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,640
And I was going there as the second wife of
Maxim de Winter.

654
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,400
'Only two more miles,' said Maxim at last.

655
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,360
'Can you see those trees on the hill in front
of us?

656
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,080
Manderley is in the valley beyond those trees.'

657
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,640
I tried to smile but suddenly I felt lonely
and afraid.

658
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,600
I was like a child on her first day at school.

659
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,480
Turning a corner, we came to a crossroads
and the beginning of a high wall.

660
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,200
'Here we are,' Maxim said.

661
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,880
'Manderley at last.'

662
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,760
I could hear the excitement in his voice.

663
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,760
The road turned again.

664
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,080
On the left, were two high iron gates and
beside them a small lodge.

665
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,480
The gates were wide open for us.

666
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
People were looking out of the windows of
the lodge.

667
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,880
They were looking at me.

668
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,200
I sat back in my seat.

669
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,000
I wanted to hide from their curious eyes.

670
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,240
'You mustn't mind if people stare at you,'
Maxim said.

671
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,400
'They are all very interested in you.

672
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,600
Don't worry.

673
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,040
Be yourself and everyone at Manderley will
love you.

674
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,080
Mrs Danvers looks after the house.

675
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,760
She's been housekeeper here for years.

676
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,280
Leave everything to her.

677
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,960
She may be rather strange at first, but don't
worry about that.

678
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,800
She will soon get used to you.'

679
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,840
We were going along the drive now that led
up to the house.

680
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,920
The drive turned and twisted like a snake.

681
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,560
The tall trees met over our heads.

682
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,000
Only a little sunlight came through their
thick branches.

683
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,240
Everything was very quiet.

684
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,480
On and on we went.

685
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,440
Then suddenly the trees came to an end.

686
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,280
The sun shone again.

687
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,320
Beautiful high bushes covered with bright
red flowers stood on either side of us.

688
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
We were not far from the house now.

689
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,080
The drive widened.

690
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,760
We turned the last corner and there was Manderley.

691
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,320
The old house was perfect.

692
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,120
It was built in a small hollow and its grey
stones glowed in the sunlight.

693
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
Smooth green lawns surrounded the house.

694
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,400
Beyond the lawns were gardens and beyond the
gardens, the sea.

695
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,440
Maxim drove up to the wide stone steps and
stopped the car in front of them.

696
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,800
At the top of the steps, a big door stood
wide open.

697
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,840
I saw that the hall beyond was full of people.

698
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,640
I could see their faces, all turned towards
us.

699
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,280
I was suddenly shy and afraid again.

700
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,440
'What's the matter?'

701
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,000
I said.

702
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,120
'Who are all those people?'

703
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,840
'I'm sorry,' Maxim said.

704
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,560
'This must be Mrs Danvers' idea.

705
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,480
Everyone who works at Manderley is here.

706
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,720
Don't look so frightened.

707
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,320
You won't have to say anything.

708
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,040
I'll do it all.'

709
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,640
An old man with a kind face came down the
steps.

710
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,400
'Well, here we are, Frith,' said Maxim.

711
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,120
'Everyone well?'

712
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,800
'Yes, thank you, sir,' said Frith.

713
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,280
'We are all very glad to see you at home again.

714
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,880
We hope you are well.

715
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,320
And Madam too, of course.'

716
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,080
'Yes, we are both well, thank you, Frith.

717
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,120
But we're tired from the drive and we want
our tea.

718
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,600
I didn't expect all these people.'

719
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,680
'Mrs Danvers' orders, sir,' said Frith.

720
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,080
'I thought so,' Maxim said.

721
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,720
'Come on,' he said to me.

722
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,280
'It won't take long and then you can have
your tea in peace.'

723
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,640
We went together up the wide stone steps.

724
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,640
Inside the open door, the servants stood in
two lines.

725
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,320
A tall, thin woman dressed in black came towards
us.

726
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,520
Her pale, thin face was hard.

727
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,360
There was no welcome in her dark eyes.

728
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,840
The hand she placed in mine was cold and heavy,
like something dead.

729
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,160
'This is Mrs Danvers, our housekeeper,' said
Maxim.

730
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,080
The woman began to speak in a cold, lifeless
voice.

731
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,320
I remember nothing of what she said.

732
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,440
I suppose she was welcoming me to Manderley.

733
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,160
As I thanked her, Mrs Danvers looked at me
with her hard, dark eyes.

734
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,520
I dropped my gloves on the floor and Mrs Danvers
picked them up with a twisted little smile

735
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,080
on her lips.

736
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,840
She could see that I was awkward and shy,
and a little afraid of my new life at Manderley.

737
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,960
Maxim noticed nothing.

738
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,920
He thanked Mrs Danvers quickly and took me
into the library for tea.

739
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,840
We were alone at last.

740
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,160
A dog ran up from the fireside to greet us.

741
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,360
He went first to Maxim and then sat down beside
me.

742
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,320
I was glad of the dog's friendly welcome.

743
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,840
The library was a large comfortable room.

744
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,640
Its walls were covered with books from the
floor to the ceiling.

745
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,560
Comfortable chairs stood on either side of
a great open fireplace.

746
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,040
From its long windows I could see the lawns
and beyond the lawns, the sea.

747
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,760
There was a quiet peace in the room.

748
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,840
It was a place for rest, for reading and for
quiet thinking.

749
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,680
Tea was brought to us by Frith and a younger
servant.

750
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,280
There was a special table and a snow-white
cloth to cover it.

751
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,680
The teapot and kettle were of silver and the
china was very fine.

752
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,240
There were sandwiches, bread and butter and
several kinds of cake.

753
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,640
There was far too much food for two people.

754
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,040
But this was the tea served at Manderley every
day.

755
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,000
Maxim sat in a chair by the fire reading the
letters that had been waiting for him.

756
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,880
Now and again, he looked up at me and smiled.

757
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,600
I leant back in my chair, drinking my tea
and trying to feel at home.

758
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,200
It was true.

759
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,920
Manderley was my home now - my home and Maxim's.

760
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,320
But somehow I still could not believe it.

761
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,960
My thoughts were interrupted by the opening
of the door.

762
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,600
It was Frith.

763
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
'Excuse me, Madam,' he said.

764
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,160
'Mrs Danvers asked if you would like to see
your room.'

765
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,480
Maxim looked up from his letters.

766
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,240
'What do the rooms in the east wing look like
now?' he said.

767
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,920
'Very nice indeed, sir,' Frith replied.

768
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,760
'I think you will be very comfortable there.'

769
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,400
'Have you been making changes?'

770
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,440
I asked.

771
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,080
'Oh, nothing much,' said Maxim.

772
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,560
'They have been getting the rooms in the east
wing ready for us.

773
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,280
There is a lovely view of the rose-garden
from there.

774
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,000
You go and make friends with Mrs Danvers.

775
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,800
I'll come up later.'

776
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,640
I got up slowly and went out with Frith into
the hall.

777
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,440
I did not want to be alone with Mrs Danvers.

778
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,480
The hall seemed very big, and my footsteps
sounded very loud on the stone floor.

779
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,720
Mrs Danvers was standing at the top of the
wide flight of stairs.

780
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,040
Her dark eyes watched me as I walked slowly
up the stairs towards her.

781
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,400
'I hope I haven't kept you waiting,' I said.

782
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,120
'It is my duty to wait for you, Madam,' Mrs
Danvers said.

783
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
'I'm here to carry out your orders.'

784
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,440
She led me along a wide passage.

785
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,080
We passed through doors and up and down wide
stairs.

786
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,000
At last Mrs Danvers opened a door leading
into a small room.

787
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,840
This room led into a large, light bedroom
with wide windows.

788
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,320
I went at once to a window and looked out.

789
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
The rose-garden lay below me.

790
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,920
Beyond the rose-garden, the smooth grass stretched
to the woods.

791
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,320
'You can't see the sea from here,' I said,
turning to Mrs Danvers.

792
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,840
'No, not from this wing,' she answered, 'and
you can't hear it either.

793
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,320
You would never know the sea was so near.'

794
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,520
Mrs Danvers spoke in a strange way, as though
this was somehow important to her.

795
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,840
'I'm sorry about that; I like the sea,' I
said.

796
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,640
'But this is a very charming room.

797
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,720
I'm sure I shall be comfortable here.'

798
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,600
'Mr de Winter gave very careful orders in
his letter about this room.

799
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,920
The rooms here have been specially arranged
for you.'

800
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,680
'Then this was not his bedroom before?'

801
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,920
'Oh, no, Madam.

802
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,200
He has never used this room.'

803
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,360
There was silence.

804
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,280
I did not know what to say.

805
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,080
I wished Mrs Danvers would go away.

806
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,800
'I suppose you have been at Manderley for
many years,' I said.

807
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,480
'Yes, Madam.

808
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,680
I came here when the first Mrs de Winter was
a bride.'

809
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,760
Her voice was suddenly harsh.

810
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,720
There was some colour in her pale face now.

811
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,280
And for a moment I saw a look of hatred in
her eyes.

812
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,400
'Mrs Danvers,' I heard myself saying, 'I hope
we shall be friends.

813
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,640
This sort of life is new to me.

814
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,200
I do want to make Mr de Winter happy.

815
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,840
I know I can leave the housekeeping to you.

816
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,160
I shan't want to make any changes.'

817
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,800
'Very well,' she said.

818
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,800
'I hope you will be satisfied.

819
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,760
I have been looking after the house for the
past year.

820
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,880
When the late Mrs de Winter was alive, there
were lots of parties and visitors, of course.

821
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,520
She liked to look after everything herself.'

822
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,520
'I would rather leave it to you, Mrs Danvers,'
I said.

823
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,320
'And I'm sure we'll be very comfortable in
these rooms.'

824
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,480
'Mr de Winter said you would rather be on
this side of the house.

825
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,720
They used the rooms in the west wing when
Mrs de Winter was alive.

826
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,440
The windows there look down to the sea.'

827
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,920
There was a sound outside the door and Mrs
Danvers stopped talking.

828
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,840
Maxim came into the room.

829
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,240
'Well, what do you think?'

830
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,520
Maxim said to me.

831
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,120
'I hope you like the rooms.

832
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,960
I think you've done very well, Mrs Danvers.'

833
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,920
'Thank you, sir,' she said.

834
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,920
Then she turned and went quietly out of the
room.

835
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,120
Maxim walked to the window.

836
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,160
'I love the rose-garden,' he said.

837
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,280
'There's something very quiet and peaceful
about this room.

838
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,000
How did you get on with Mrs Danvers?

839
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,240
She's a strange woman in many ways.

840
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,360
I think that some of the young servants are
afraid of her.'

841
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,680
'I expect we'll get on well when she knows
me better,' I said.

842
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,480
'She may not like me at first, of course.'

843
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,960
'Not like you?

844
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,000
Why shouldn't she like you?' said Maxim and
he came across the room and kissed me gently.

845
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
'Let's forget about Mrs Danvers,' he said.

846
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,360
'Come along, and I'll show you Manderley.'

847
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,200
I felt happier as I walked through the house
with Maxim.

848
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,840
We looked at the pictures in the long gallery
and at most of the rooms downstairs.

849
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,640
Maxim put his arm round my shoulder.

850
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,160
I began to feel that Manderley really was
my home.

851
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,280
After dinner, we sat in the library.

852
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,480
The curtains were drawn and more logs put
on the fire.

853
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,600
It was new for us to sit together quietly
like this.

854
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,520
In Italy we had walked about in the evenings,
or gone for a drive.

855
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,280
Maxim sat in the chair to the left of the
fireplace.

856
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,800
He picked up the paper.

857
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,280
He put a cushion behind his head and lit a
cigarette.

858
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,480
This is what he always did, I thought.

859
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,800
This is what he did before he knew me.

860
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,680
It is what he has done every evening for years.

861
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,720
Maxim did not look at me.

862
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,840
He went on reading his paper.

863
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,520
He was comfortable, the master of his house.

864
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,240
I poured myself another cup of coffee.

865
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,360
I bent down to the dog and stroked its soft
ears.

866
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,240
Suddenly I shivered as though a door had opened
behind me.

867
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,040
Someone else had sat in my chair.

868
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,160
Someone else had poured coffee and stroked
the dog.

869
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,960
I was sitting in Rebecca's chair.

870
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,680
I was leaning against Rebecca's cushion.

871
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,160
The dog, Jasper, came to me because in the
past he had come to Rebecca.

872
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,760
CHAPTER SIX

873
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,200
In the Morning-Room

874
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,360
Life at Manderley was very carefully planned.

875
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,400
The same things happened at the same time
every day.

876
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,440
I remember our first morning there very clearly.

877
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,040
I had slept well and came downstairs a little
after nine o'clock.

878
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,680
To my surprise, I found that Maxim had nearly
finished his breakfast.

879
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,400
Maxim looked up at me and smiled.

880
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,600
'I always get up early here,' he said.

881
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,320
'Looking after Manderley takes a lot of my
time.

882
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,280
I work very hard.

883
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,360
But you don't have to.

884
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,800
Help yourself to anything you want.'

885
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,760
I remember the size of that breakfast.

886
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,680
It was the normal Manderley breakfast, but
far too much for two people.

887
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,560
As I took an egg and some coffee, I wondered
what happened to the food that was left.

888
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,880
Would it be eaten or thrown away?

889
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,960
I would never know of course.

890
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,440
I would certainly be too afraid to ask.

891
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,960
'My sister, Beatrice, is coming over to lunch
with her husband,' Maxim told me.

892
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,400
'She invited herself, of course.

893
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,800
I suppose she wants to have a look at you.'

894
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,200
They're coming today?'

895
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,520
I said, feeling less happy than before.

896
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,240
'Yes, but she won't stay long.

897
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,840
I think you'll like Beatrice.

898
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,200
She believes in telling the truth.

899
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,680
If she doesn't like you, she'll tell you so.'

900
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,320
Maxim stood up and lit a cigarette.

901
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,360
'I've so many things to do this morning.

902
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,800
Why don't you go into the garden.

903
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,840
You don't mind being alone, do you?'

904
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,680
'Of course not,' I said.

905
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,960
'I shall be perfectly happy.'

906
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,360
But I did not feel very happy as Maxim walked
out of the room.

907
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,200
I had thought we would spend our first morning
at Manderley together.

908
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,160
I had thought that perhaps we would walk down
to the sea, or sit under the great tree on

909
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:38,660
the lawn.

910
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,360
I finished my breakfast alone.

911
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,000
I left the dining-room and went into the library.

912
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,760
The room was cold.

913
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,000
The fire was laid, but not lit.

914
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,280
I looked round for a box of matches, but I
could not find one.

915
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,320
I went across the hall and into the dining-room
once more.

916
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,600
Yes, there was a box of matches on the table.

917
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,960
I picked it up.

918
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,440
At that moment, Frith came into the room.

919
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,120
'Oh, Frith,' I said awkwardly, 'I could not
find any matches.

920
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,280
I thought I would light the fire in the library.

921
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,960
It's rather cold in there.'

922
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,960
'The fire in the library is not usually lit
until the afternoon, Madam,' he said.

923
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,280
'Mrs de Winter always used the morning-room
before lunch.

924
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,640
There is a good fire in there.

925
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,040
Of course, I can give orders for the fire
in the library to be lit.'

926
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,760
'Oh no,' I said.

927
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,960
'I'll go into the morning-room.

928
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,560
Thank you, Frith.'

929
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,240
'Mrs de Winter always wrote her letters in
the morning-room after breakfast.

930
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,000
The house telephone is there too, if you want
to talk to Mrs Danvers.'

931
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,720
'Thank you, Frith,' I said.

932
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,960
I went into the hall again, I did not know
which way to go.

933
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,320
I could not tell Frith that I had never seen
the morning-room.

934
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,040
Maxim had not shown it to me the night before.

935
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,720
'You go through the drawing-room 
to the morning-room, 

936
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,200
Madam,' Frith said, watching me.

937
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,480
'Then turn to your left.'

938
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,840
'Thank you, Frith,' I said.

939
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,000
I felt very stupid.

940
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,880
I found my way into the little morning-room.

941
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,960
I was glad to see the dog, Jasper, there,
sitting in front of the fire.

942
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,680
The morning-room was quite small and very
different from the library.

943
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,960
It was a woman's room, graceful and charming.

944
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,560
Someone had chosen everything in this room
with the greatest care.

945
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,560
Each chair, each rug, each small ornament
had been put there to make the room perfect.

946
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,120
Flowers filled the room, glowing blood-red
flowers.

947
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,000
They were the same flowers we had seen in
the drive.

948
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,840
A beautiful old writing-desk stood near the
window.

949
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,480
I went over and opened the desk carefully.

950
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,000
Every drawer was labelled and everything was
in order.

951
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,240
Inside one of the drawers was a flat leather
book: 'Guests at Manderley'.

952
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,120
I opened the book.

953
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,200
The writing inside the book and the writing
on the labels was the same.

954
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,480
I had seen that tall sloping writing before.

955
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,400
It was Rebecca's writing.

956
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,320
This was Rebecca's desk.

957
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,040
I sat down and opened the Guest Book.

958
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,760
Every page was covered with the same writing.

959
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,760
I felt that Rebecca would come back into the
room at any moment.

960
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,400
The mistress of the house would come in and
find me, a stranger, sitting at her desk.

961
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,000
Suddenly the telephone on the desk began to
ring.

962
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,880
My heart jumped.

963
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,560
I picked up the phone.

964
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,080
'Who is it?'

965
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:30,960
I said.

966
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,520
'Who do you want?'

967
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,600
'Mrs de Winter?' said a hard, deep voice,
'Mrs de Winter?'

968
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,760
My hand was shaking.

969
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,960
'I'm afraid you have made a mistake,' I said.

970
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,120
'Mrs de Winter has been dead for over a year.'

971
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,080
I suddenly realized what I had said.

972
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,840
'It's Mrs Danvers, Madam,' said the voice.

973
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,040
'I'm speaking to you on the house telephone.'

974
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,960
'I'm so sorry, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

975
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,880
'I didn't know what I was saying.

976
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,360
I did not expect the telephone to ring.'

977
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,040
'I wondered if you had seen the menus for
the day.

978
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,840
You will find the list on the desk beside
you.'

979
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,280
I found the piece of paper and looked at it
quickly.

980
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,600
'Yes, Mrs Danvers.

981
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,280
Yes, very nice indeed.'

982
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,560
'I'm very sorry to have disturbed you, Madam.'

983
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,560
'You didn't disturb me at all.

984
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,520
Thank you, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

985
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,800
I put down the phone and looked at the desk.

986
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,880
I felt very stupid.

987
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,840
Rebecca would not have answered like that.

988
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,400
I thought of Rebecca sitting at that desk.

989
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,400
Here she had chosen her guests and written
letters to her friends.

990
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,880
Who could I write to?

991
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,760
I knew nobody.

992
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,240
Then I thought of Mrs Van Hopper, far away
in New York.

993
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,760
I took a piece of paper and a pen.

994
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,280
'Dear Mrs Van Hopper,' I began.

995
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,160
As I wrote I noticed my own handwriting for
the first time.

996
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,800
How weak and childish it was!

997
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,440
It was like the writing of a schoolgirl.

998
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,440
CHAPTER SEVEN

999
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,840
You Are So Very Different...

1000
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,360
When I heard the sound of a car in the drive,
I stood up in sudden fear.

1001
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,920
Beatrice and her husband had arrived.

1002
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,560
They were earlier than I expected.

1003
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,000
And Maxim had not come back.

1004
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,240
I could not meet them by myself.

1005
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,600
I ran quickly out of the morning-room.

1006
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,880
I took a door to the left.

1007
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,960
I was in a stone corridor.

1008
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,360
A servant stared at me in surprise.

1009
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,400
I hurried up some stairs, hoping that I could
find my way to my bedroom in the east wing.

1010
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,960
I could stay there until Maxim came back.

1011
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,360
Somehow I lost my way.

1012
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,560
But I went on and came to a wide staircase.

1013
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,160
I went up it.

1014
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,240
All was quiet and dark.

1015
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,200
I was in a corridor with doors on either side.

1016
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,120
I walked on and at last I came to a long window.

1017
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,560
I looked out.

1018
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,680
Below me I could see green lawns and the sea.

1019
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,000
The sea was bright green, with white-topped
waves.

1020
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,480
It was closer than I thought, much closer.

1021
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,000
I knew then that I had walked right round
the house.

1022
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,960
I was standing in the corridor of the west
wing.

1023
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,840
Yes, Mrs Danvers was right, you could hear
the sea from here.

1024
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,680
I was glad that my rooms were in the east
wing.

1025
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,320
I loved the quiet beauty of the rose-garden.

1026
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,720
The sea was too near here.

1027
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:40,080
As I turned to go back to the stairs, I heard
a door open behind me.

1028
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,360
Mrs Danvers stood there.

1029
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,480
We stared at one another for a moment without
speaking.

1030
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,680
'I lost my way,' I said, 'I was trying to
find my room.'

1031
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,920
'This is the west wing,' she said.

1032
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,280
'Did you go into any of the rooms?

1033
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,840
If you wish to see them, please tell me.

1034
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,840
I could show them to you now.'

1035
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,160
I shook my head.

1036
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,000
'No, no thank you,' I said.

1037
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,680
'I must go downstairs.'

1038
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,920
As I began to walk towards the stairs, Mrs
Danvers followed me.

1039
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,880
'If you want to see the rooms in the west
wing, I can show them to you at any time.'

1040
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,040
'It's very kind of you, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

1041
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,840
'I will let you know.'

1042
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,640
Mrs Danvers walked beside me.

1043
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,120
'Major and Mrs Lacy have been here some time,'
she said.

1044
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,880
'Didn't you hear their car?

1045
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,600
Frith took them to the morning-room.

1046
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,600
I think you know your way now, don't you?'

1047
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,160
'Yes, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

1048
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,720
I knew then that she had been watching me,
laughing at my fear.

1049
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,600
As I went into the drawing-room, I looked
back.

1050
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,360
Mrs Danvers was still watching me from the
top of the stairs.

1051
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,040
I could hear the sound of voices from the
morning-room.

1052
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,000
I stood for a moment and then walked in.

1053
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,600
'Here she is at last,' Maxim said.

1054
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,440
'Where have you been hiding?

1055
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,400
Here is Beatrice and this is Giles.

1056
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,720
And this is Frank Crawley, our agent.'

1057
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,360
Beatrice was tall, broad-shouldered and very
much like Maxim.

1058
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,520
She shook hands with me and said to Maxim,
'She's quite different from what I expected.

1059
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,160
Not like your description at all.'

1060
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,160
Everyone laughed, but they seemed friendly.

1061
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,800
Giles was a big, heavy man.

1062
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,520
His eyes smiled at me from behind his thick
glasses.

1063
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,440
Frank Crawley was a thin man with a pleasant,
worried face.

1064
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,520
Maxim had told me how hard Frank Crawley worked
for Manderley.

1065
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,080
The men began to talk together and I had to
answer Beatrice's questions.

1066
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,960
'What do you think of Manderley?'

1067
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,600
she asked me.

1068
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,720
'I haven't seen much of it yet,' I said.

1069
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,880
'The house is beautiful, of course.

1070
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,040
I haven't seen the gardens, but I'm sure I
shall never get tired of them.

1071
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,640
I love walking.

1072
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,360
I can swim too, when the weather is warmer.'

1073
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,480
'My dear, the water is always far too cold
here,' said Beatrice.

1074
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,440
'I don't mind that, I love swimming.

1075
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,520
Is it safe to swim in the bays?'

1076
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,920
Everyone stopped talking.

1077
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,080
I realized what I had said.

1078
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,920
Rebecca had been drowned in the bay.

1079
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,200
I could not look at Maxim.

1080
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,760
I bent down to stroke the dog's head.

1081
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,680
Then, thank God, Frith came in to say that
lunch was ready.

1082
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,920
Beatrice walked with me through the hall.

1083
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,160
'You know,' she said, 'you are much younger
than I expected.

1084
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,520
Tell me, do you love Maxim very much?'

1085
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,800
Beatrice looked at my surprised face and laughed.

1086
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,360
'Don't answer,' she said.

1087
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,480
'I can see that you do.

1088
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,560
Maxim looks very well.

1089
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,520
We were all very worried about him last year.

1090
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,440
But of course, you know the whole story.'

1091
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,680
But Beatrice was wrong.

1092
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,480
I did not know what had happened down in the
bay.

1093
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,720
Maxim had told me nothing.

1094
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,840
I had never asked him about Rebecca's death.

1095
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,960
Beatrice talked to Maxim all through lunch.

1096
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,040
Frank Crawley told me a lot about Manderley.

1097
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,920
I could see that he loved it as much as Maxim
did.

1098
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,840
When lunch was over, I could see that Maxim
was tired.

1099
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,480
I wished we hadn't had visitors so soon.

1100
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,200
I took Beatrice out on to the terrace.

1101
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,680
She asked me how I had met Maxim.

1102
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,280
I told her about Mrs Van Hopper and how surprised
she had been.

1103
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,120
'It was rather a shock to us too,' Beatrice
said.

1104
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,240
'Maxim said in his letter that you were very
young and pretty.

1105
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,040
We expected a very modern sort of girl.'

1106
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,680
Beatrice laughed and I laughed with her.

1107
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,760
'Poor Maxim.

1108
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,160
He had a terrible time,' Beatrice said.

1109
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,280
'Let's hope you have made him forget all about
it.

1110
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,120
He loves Manderley so much.

1111
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,720
But you never know what he is thinking.

1112
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,280
How do you get on with Mrs Danvers?'

1113
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,160
I was surprised by Beatrice's question.

1114
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,840
'She frightens me a little,' I said.

1115
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,920
'She may try to make things unpleasant for
you,' Beatrice went on.

1116
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,920
'She's very jealous, of course.

1117
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,920
She must hate you being here.'

1118
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,760
'Why?'

1119
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,320
I asked.

1120
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,840
'Why must she hate me being at Manderley?'

1121
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:11,520
'My dear child,' Beatrice answered slowly,
'I thought Maxim had told you.

1122
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,080
Mrs Danvers adored Rebecca.

1123
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,440
She still does.'

1124
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,640
At that moment, the men came out of the house.

1125
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,440
A servant brought rugs and chairs and we all
sat under the great tree on the lawn.

1126
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,000
I hoped everyone would go soon.

1127
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,320
I wanted to be alone with Maxim.

1128
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,080
I was sitting on a rug, leaning against Maxim's
chair.

1129
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,560
I listened to the others talking.

1130
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,360
The afternoon was sleepy and peaceful.

1131
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,840
Everything was quiet and still.

1132
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,520
Even the sea seemed far away.

1133
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,720
This is what I wanted, I thought.

1134
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,840
This is how I thought life at Manderley would
be.

1135
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,320
This moment was safe.

1136
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,440
It could not be touched.

1137
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,200
Here we sat together, Maxim and I, hand in
hand.

1138
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,160
The past and the future did not matter at
all.

1139
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,000
At this moment I was not afraid.

1140
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,960
The moment passed.

1141
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,560
Beatrice stood up.

1142
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,360
'We must be going,' she said.

1143
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,720
'We've got people coming to dinner.'

1144
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,680
We all got up and Giles looked up at the sky.

1145
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,920
'I'm afraid we're going to have some rain,'
he said.

1146
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,600
We all walked slowly back to the drive.

1147
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,320
Beatrice took my hand.

1148
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,840
Then she bent down and kissed me.

1149
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,600
'Forgive me if I've asked you a lot of rude
questions, my dear.

1150
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,640
As I said before, you are not what we expected.

1151
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,360
You are so very different from Rebecca.'

1152
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,520
As we reached the car, the sun went behind
a cloud and a little rain began to fall.

1153
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,640
Maxim and I watched the car drive away.

1154
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:57,840
We turned and walked back into the house.

1155
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,040
CHAPTER EIGHT

1156
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,720
The Happy Valley

1157
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,240
As we stood in the hall, Maxim put his arm
round my shoulders.

1158
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,920
'Thank God that's over,' he said.

1159
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,080
'Get a coat quickly and let's go out.

1160
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,600
Never mind the rain, I want a walk.'

1161
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,480
Maxim looked white and ill.

1162
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,360
Had Beatrice said something to make him angry?

1163
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,800
I could not remember.

1164
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,760
'Just a moment,' I said.

1165
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,280
'I'll get my coat from upstairs.'

1166
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,800
'There are plenty of raincoats downstairs,'
Maxim said.

1167
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,840
'Robert, will you fetch a coat for Mrs de
Winter?'

1168
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,760
Maxim was standing in the drive now, calling
to Jasper.

1169
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,160
'Come on, you lazy little fellow.

1170
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:40,960
You're too fat.'

1171
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,640
Jasper ran round in circles, barking loudly.

1172
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,640
The young servant, Robert, ran out of the
hall, carrying a raincoat.

1173
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,320
I put it on quickly.

1174
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,880
It was too big, of course, and too long.

1175
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,880
But Maxim was waiting impatiently and there
was no time to change the coat.

1176
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,000
We set off together across the lawns to the
woods.

1177
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,920
Jasper ran on in front.

1178
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,480
'I soon get tired of my family,' Maxim said.

1179
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,280
'Beatrice is very kind-hearted, but she always
says the wrong thing.'

1180
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,080
I was not sure what Beatrice had said and
I thought it better not to ask.

1181
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,960
'What did you think of Beatrice?'

1182
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,840
Maxim asked me.

1183
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,240
'What did she talk to you about after lunch?'

1184
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,080
'I think I did most of the talking,' I said.

1185
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,400
'I was telling her about how we met.

1186
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,440
She said I was quite different from what she
expected.'

1187
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,920
'What on earth did she expect?'

1188
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,800
'Someone much smarter, I think.

1189
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,880
A modern young woman.'

1190
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,280
Maxim did not answer.

1191
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,400
He bent down and threw a stick for Jasper
to run after.

1192
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,880
We climbed the grass bank above the lawns
and walked down into the woods.

1193
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,800
The trees grew very close together over our
heads and it was very dark.

1194
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,440
We walked on last year's leaves.

1195
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,640
The green shoots of flowers were beginning
to show through.

1196
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,920
Jasper was silent now, with his nose to the
ground.

1197
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,640
We came to a clearing in the woods.

1198
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,760
There were two paths, going 
in opposite directions.

1199
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,840
Jasper ran on ahead and took the right-hand
path without waiting for us.

1200
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,800
'Not that way,' called Maxim.

1201
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,600
'Come on, old boy.'

1202
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,320
The dog looked back at us.

1203
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,320
He stood there, wagging his tail.

1204
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,800
'Why does he want to go that way?'

1205
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,360
I asked.

1206
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,960
'I suppose he's used to it,' Maxim said quickly.

1207
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,160
'It leads to a small bay where we used to
keep a boat.

1208
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,160
Come on, Jasper, old boy, this way.'

1209
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,800
We turned on to the left-hand path, not saying
anything.

1210
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,080
I looked over my shoulder and saw that Jasper
was following us.

1211
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,640
'This path brings us to the valley I told
you about,' Maxim told me.

1212
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,960
'You can smell the flowers already.

1213
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,600
Never mind the rain, it will bring out the
scent.'

1214
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,000
Maxim seemed all right again now, happy and
cheerful.

1215
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,280
He began talking about Frank Crawley.

1216
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,480
He told me what a good agent he was and how
he loved Manderley.

1217
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,160
I held Maxim's arm and looked up into his
face.

1218
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,680
Talking about Manderley always made Maxim
happy again.

1219
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,080
We had reached the top of a small hill.

1220
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,680
The path ran down into a little valley, by
the side of a stream.

1221
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,360
'There,' said Maxim, 'look at that.'

1222
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,440
There were no dark trees in this valley, no
thick bushes.

1223
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:24,320
On either side of the narrow path stood high
graceful bushes covered with flowers.

1224
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,080
The flowers were pink, white and gold.

1225
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,760
They were things of beauty and grace.

1226
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,240
The soft summer rain fell and the air was
full of a sweet scent.

1227
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:39,360
There was no sound except for the noise of
a little stream and the quiet rain on the

1228
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:39,860
leaves.

1229
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,600
When Maxim spoke, his voice was gentle and
low.

1230
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,280
'We call it the Happy Valley,' he said.

1231
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,080
We stood still, not speaking.

1232
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,960
I looked down at the clear white flowers.

1233
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,160
Maxim picked up a fallen flower and gave it
to me.

1234
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,720
As I rubbed it between my hands, the scent
was sweet and strong.

1235
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,880
A bird began to sing, a high, clear sound.

1236
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,120
Other birds began to sing too.

1237
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,480
I had never been in so beautiful a place.

1238
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,600
As we walked along the path, drops of rain
fell on my hands and face.

1239
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,920
I held Maxim's hand.

1240
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:24,320
The Happy Valley was the heart of Manderley,
the Manderley I would soon know and love.

1241
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,600
CHAPTER NINE

1242
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,840
The Cottage in the Bay

1243
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,240
We came to the end of the path.

1244
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,240
The bushes made an arch over our heads so
that we had to bend down.

1245
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,920
I stood straight again, brushing the rain
from my head.

1246
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,560
I saw that the valley was behind us.

1247
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,680
We were standing in a little narrow bay.

1248
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,960
There, almost at our feet was the sea.

1249
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,960
Maxim looked down at me, smiling at the surprise
on my face.

1250
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,560
'It is a surprise, isn't it?' he said.

1251
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,840
'No one ever expects it.'

1252
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,600
Maxim picked up a stone and threw it across
the beach for Jasper.

1253
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,320
'Fetch it, good boy,' he said.

1254
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,760
Jasper ran after the stone, 
barking with excitement.

1255
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,160
We both went down to the water's edge and
threw more stones.

1256
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,680
The tide was coming up into the bay and the
water was beginning to cover the stones.

1257
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,680
Maxim turned to me, laughing and wiping the
hair out of his eyes.

1258
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,560
I rolled up the long sleeves of the raincoat.

1259
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,680
It was a happy moment.

1260
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,400
Then we saw that Jasper had gone.

1261
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,960
We called and whistled, but he did not come.

1262
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,000
'Has he gone back to the Happy Valley?'

1263
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,040
I asked.

1264
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,600
'He was by that rock a minute ago,' said Maxim.

1265
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,320
We walked up the beach towards the valley
again.

1266
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,040
'Jasper, Jasper,' called Maxim.

1267
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,960
In the distance, beyond a line of rocks to
the right of the beach, I heard a sharp bark.

1268
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,240
'Do you hear that?'

1269
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,280
I said.

1270
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,320
'He's gone over this way.'

1271
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,720
I began to climb up the wet rocks.

1272
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,880
'Come back,' Maxim said sharply, 'we don't
want to go that way.'

1273
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,440
'I must get him,' I said.

1274
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,240
'He may be hurt.'

1275
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,960
'He's all right,' said Maxim.

1276
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,760
'Leave him.

1277
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,320
He knows the way home.'

1278
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,960
I began climbing over the rocks towards Jasper.

1279
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,880
I thought Maxim was being very unkind.

1280
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,080
I got to the top of the largest rock and looked
beyond it.

1281
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,840
There was another bay.

1282
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,840
A small stone wall across the bay made it
into a small harbour.

1283
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,520
In the bay was a green and white buoy, but
no boat.

1284
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,240
The woods came right down to the shore.

1285
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,040
At the edge of the woods was a low stone building,
a cottage or a boat-house.

1286
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,320
There was a man standing on the shore, dressed
like a fisherman.

1287
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,680
Jasper was barking at him and running round
and round.

1288
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,920
The man took no notice of the dog.

1289
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,160
'Jasper,' I shouted, 'Jasper, come here.'

1290
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,840
The dog looked up, but he did not come to
me.

1291
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,400
I looked back, but I could not see Maxim.

1292
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,240
I climbed down into the bay and the man looked
at me for the first time.

1293
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,640
There was something strange about him.

1294
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,680
He had small, stupid looking eyes.

1295
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,200
His face was fat and round and he had thick,
red lips.

1296
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,160
'Bad weather, isn't it?'

1297
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,400
the man said with a stupid smile.

1298
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,120
'It's not very nice weather,' I said.

1299
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,080
'Come on Jasper, we must go home now.'

1300
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,880
But Jasper ran away, barking.

1301
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,160
'Have you got any string?'

1302
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:30,960
I asked the man.

1303
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,520
'I want something to tie the dog.

1304
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,400
He won't follow me.'

1305
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,040
'I know that dog, it's not yours.

1306
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,280
It comes from the house.'

1307
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,200
'He's Mr de Winter's dog,' I said kindly.

1308
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,960
'I must take him back.'

1309
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,520
The man said nothing, but stared at me in
the same stupid way.

1310
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,400
I walked up the shore to the cottage.

1311
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,400
Perhaps there was some string there.

1312
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,760
The grass round the little house had grown
very long.

1313
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,400
The windows had pieces of wood over them.

1314
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,160
I pushed at the door.

1315
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,840
To my surprise it opened and I went inside.

1316
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,520
The room was furnished and there were books
on the shelves.

1317
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,240
But everything was covered with thick dust.

1318
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,400
The air was damp and still.

1319
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,840
Another door at the end of the room led into
a small boat-house.

1320
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,040
I saw some string on a shelf and an old knife.

1321
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,480
I cut a piece of string for Jasper and went
out of the cottage.

1322
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,000
There was something frightening about that
small, dark room.

1323
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,080
I was glad to be outside again.

1324
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,840
The man was still watching me, staring like
a child.

1325
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,440
Jasper was quiet now and let me tie the string.

1326
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,080
'I saw you go in there,' the man said.

1327
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,640
'She doesn't go in there now.

1328
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,560
She's gone in the sea.

1329
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,440
She won't come back, will she?'

1330
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,760
'No,' I said.

1331
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,360
'She won't come back.'

1332
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,120
'I didn't say anything, did I?'

1333
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,440
The man's eyes were full of fear.

1334
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,560
He turned away and walked back towards the
sea.

1335
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,720
Maxim was waiting for me beside the rocks.

1336
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,600
He looked angry.

1337
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,400
'I'm sorry,' I said.

1338
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,080
'I had to get some string for Jasper.

1339
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,760
Who is that man?'

1340
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,240
'That's Ben.

1341
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,920
He's a bit mad, but he won't hurt you.

1342
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:21,760
Where did you get that string?'

1343
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,640
'I found it in the cottage.

1344
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,520
The door was open.

1345
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,520
There's dust everywhere.

1346
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,720
The place ought to be cleaned.'

1347
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,320
'The door should be locked,' Maxim said.

1348
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,840
He was walking very fast now.

1349
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,120
He went up past the cottage and on to a path
through the woods.

1350
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It was very different here from the Happy
Valley.

1351
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,280
The path was steep and the trees were thick,
and dark.

1352
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,320
It was cold now and my legs ached.

1353
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,360
Jasper was tired too, and walked very slowly.

1354
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,400
'Come on, Jasper, for God's sake,' said Maxim
angrily.

1355
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,200
'Pull at that string, can't you?' he said
to me.

1356
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,640
'It's your fault,' I said, 'you walk so fast.'

1357
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,920
'If you had listened to me, we would be home
by now.

1358
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,760
There was no need for you to go after Jasper.'

1359
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,720
'I thought you would come with me,' I answered.

1360
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,520
'Why should I run after the damned dog?'

1361
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,160
Maxim said, not looking at me.

1362
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,440
'That's an excuse.

1363
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,160
You didn't want to go over the rocks,' I answered.

1364
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,440
'All right, I didn't.

1365
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,960
I didn't want to go to the other bay.

1366
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,280
I never go near the place or that damned cottage.

1367
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,560
If you had my memories, you would not go there
either.

1368
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,720
You wouldn't talk about it or even think about
it.'

1369
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,440
Maxim's face was white.

1370
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,280
His eyes had a dark, lost look.

1371
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,680
I took his hand and held it tight.

1372
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,800
'Please, Maxim, please,' I said.

1373
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,240
'I don't want you to look like that.

1374
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:41,840
I'm sorry, darling.

1375
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,520
Please don't let us quarrel.'

1376
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,880
'We should have stayed in Italy,' Maxim said.

1377
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,360
'I was a fool to bring you back to Manderley.'

1378
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,000
I had to run to keep up with him now.

1379
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,240
At last we came to the top of the path and
out on to the lawn.

1380
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,600
Maxim's face was hard.

1381
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,480
He walked straight into the house and spoke
to Frith.

1382
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,520
'We want tea at once,' said Maxim.

1383
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,880
Then he went quickly into the library and
shut the door.

1384
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,320
I tried to keep back my tears.

1385
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,520
Frith must not see them.

1386
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,640
I turned away as he helped me off with the
raincoat.

1387
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,480
He picked up a handkerchief.

1388
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,520
'Is this yours, Madam?' he said.

1389
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,240
I put the handkerchief in my pocket and walked
slowly across the hall to the library.

1390
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,080
Maxim was sitting in his usual chair, with
Jasper at his feet.

1391
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,160
I walked across the room and knelt down by
Maxim's chair.

1392
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,840
'Don't be angry with me any more,' I said.

1393
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,080
Maxim looked down at me.

1394
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,280
'I'm not angry with you,' he said.

1395
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,720
'But I've made you unhappy,' I replied.

1396
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,120
'I want you to be happy so much.

1397
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,400
I love you.'

1398
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,840
'Do you?' he said.

1399
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,680
His eyes were full of pain and fear.

1400
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,160
'What is it, darling?'

1401
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:56,800
I said.

1402
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,920
'Why do you look like that?'

1403
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,920
The door opened before Maxim could answer.

1404
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,600
It was Frith and Robert with the tea.

1405
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,520
The small table was put near the fire and
covered with the white cloth.

1406
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,560
Frith brought in the silver teapot and kettle.

1407
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,600
Then came the cups, the sandwiches and cakes.

1408
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,920
Everything was the same as yesterday.

1409
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,000
When the servants had gone, I looked at Maxim's
face.

1410
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,520
The colour had come back into it.

1411
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,040
He took a sandwich.

1412
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,640
'Pour me a cup of tea, darling,' he said to
me.

1413
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,040
'And forgive me for being so unkind.'

1414
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,920
There was nothing more to say.

1415
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,040
Maxim smiled at me and picked up his paper.

1416
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:39,200
Maxim's smile was like a pat on the head given
to Jasper.

1417
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,800
I was not hungry and I felt very tired.

1418
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,320
I gave Jasper a piece of cake and took out
the handkerchief to wipe my hands.

1419
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,760
The handkerchief was not mine.

1420
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,400
It must have come from the raincoat pocket.

1421
01:09:53,520 --> 01:10:00,080
There were some letters in the corner - a
tall "R" and "de W." It was Rebecca's.

1422
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,640
The raincoat, too wide, too long for me, must
have been hers too.

1423
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,280
Rebecca had worn that raincoat.

1424
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,600
She had left the handkerchief in the pocket.

1425
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,560
I could smell a scent, a scent I knew.

1426
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,840
I shut my eyes and tried to remember what
it was.

1427
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,160
Suddenly I knew.

1428
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,640
The scent on the handkerchief was the scent
of the flowers in the Happy Valley.

1429
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:29,840
Was there nowhere I could escape from Rebecca?

1430
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,080
CHAPTER TEN

1431
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,520
Questions and Answers

1432
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,320
The weather was wet and cold for over a week.

1433
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,560
We did not go down to the beach again.

1434
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,840
I could see the sea from the terrace and the
lawns.

1435
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,840
It looked cold and grey.

1436
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,960
When I stood on the terrace, I could hear
the sound of great waves on the shore.

1437
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,920
I began to understand why some people hated
the low, angry voice of the sea.

1438
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,920
I was glad that our rooms were in the east
wing.

1439
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,920
If I could not sleep, I went to the window
and looked out on to the rose-garden.

1440
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,280
I was not troubled by the sea's unhappy music.

1441
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,520
Sometimes I thought about the cottage down
in the bay.

1442
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,880
There were so many questions I wanted to ask
Maxim.

1443
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,000
I could not forget the lost look in Maxim's
eyes.

1444
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,280
I could not forget his words: 'I was a fool
to bring you back to Manderley.'

1445
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,920
It was all my fault.

1446
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,320
I had gone down into the bay.

1447
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,160
I had reminded Maxim of the past.

1448
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,760
We lived our lives together sleeping, eating,
walking.

1449
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,080
But, every hour of the day, the past made
a wall between us.

1450
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,840
I became nervous and afraid.

1451
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,440
I did not want anyone to talk about the sea
or boats.

1452
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,800
When visitors came to Manderley, I was shy
and awkward.

1453
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,600
I knew that they compared me with Rebecca.

1454
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,880
She had been charming, interested in everyone.

1455
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,920
I was dull and stupid, like a schoolgirl.

1456
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:15,280
One afternoon, I was having tea alone when
the wife of the bishop called.

1457
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,720
She was a kind woman and tried hard to make
me talk.

1458
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,480
At last she said,

1459
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:25,520
'Will your husband hold the Manderley Fancy
Dress Ball this year?

1460
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,800
I remember the last one so well.

1461
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,720
It was such a lovely sight.

1462
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,000
I shall never forget it.'

1463
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,840
I smiled and said, 'We have not decided.

1464
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,160
There have been so many things to do.'

1465
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,880
I could not tell the woman that Maxim had
never spoken about the ball.

1466
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,600
'Manderley looked so beautiful,' the bishop's
wife went on.

1467
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:52,320
'And there was dancing, and music and flowers
everywhere.'

1468
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,640
'Yes,' I said.

1469
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,200
'Yes, I must ask Maxim about it.'

1470
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:02,800
'We came to a garden-party too, one summer,'
the bishop's wife went on.

1471
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,480
'It was a lovely day.

1472
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,880
We all had tea in the rose-garden.

1473
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,960
It was such a clever idea.

1474
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,360
Of course, she was a clever person.'

1475
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,560
She stopped, her face rather red.

1476
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:19,120
I heard myself saying, 'Rebecca must have
been a wonderful person...'

1477
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,840
I had said her name at last.

1478
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,360
'Rebecca.'

1479
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,280
I had said it aloud.

1480
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,600
'You never met her then?'

1481
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,040
the woman asked.

1482
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,840
'Yes, she was a lovely person.

1483
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,520
So full of life.

1484
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,720
Everyone loved her.'

1485
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,840
'She was so good at everything too,' I said.

1486
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,800
'Clever, beautiful and fond of sport.'

1487
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,200
'Rebecca was certainly beautiful,' my visitor
went on.

1488
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,320
'I remember her on the night of the Ball.

1489
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,560
She had a cloud of dark hair.

1490
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,920
Her skin was very white.

1491
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,320
And she had such a lovely dress.'

1492
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,320
'She looked after everything in the house,
too,' I said.

1493
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,880
'I'm afraid I leave it all to the housekeeper.'

1494
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,800
'Oh well, you are very young, aren't you?

1495
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,160
We can't all do everything.

1496
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,160
I must go now.

1497
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,760
Do ask your husband to have another ball.'

1498
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,160
'Yes, of course I will.'

1499
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,560
I sat in the library after my visitor had
gone.

1500
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:23,680
I thought about Manderley, full of people
in beautiful costumes, dancing in the hall.

1501
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,840
I thought of Rebecca, lively and beautiful,
arranging everything.

1502
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,640
What must people think about me?

1503
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,840
I suddenly sat up straight.

1504
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,920
I did not mind.

1505
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:36,800
I did not care.

1506
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,840
I was Mrs de Winter now, not Rebecca.

1507
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,680
I decided that I would find out more about
the Fancy Dress Ball.

1508
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,920
But I did not want to ask Maxim.

1509
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,400
Later that afternoon, Frank Crawley came up
to the house.

1510
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,840
'I have been hearing about the Fancy Dress
Ball, Frank,' I said.

1511
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,440
'I did not know you had dances here.'

1512
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,080
Frank did not reply at once.

1513
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,880
Then he said, 'The Manderley Ball was held
every year.

1514
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,520
People came from miles around.

1515
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,080
They even came down from London.'

1516
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,080
'It must have been a lot of work,' I said.

1517
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,800
'I suppose Rebecca did most of it.'

1518
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,040
Frank looked straight ahead.

1519
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:20,080
'We all helped,' he said.

1520
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,600
'Will you ask Maxim about the Ball?'

1521
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,160
I asked.

1522
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,920
'It does seem a good idea.'

1523
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,640
Frank did not answer me.

1524
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,840
'I went into that cottage in the bay a few
days ago,' I said.

1525
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,440
'It's very dirty.

1526
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,840
Why doesn't someone do something about it?'

1527
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:43,120
'Maxim would tell me if he wanted anything
done,' Frank replied.

1528
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,840
'Are they Rebecca's things?'

1529
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,400
I asked.

1530
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,720
'Yes,' Frank said.

1531
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,240
'Did Rebecca use the cottage a lot?'

1532
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,200
'Yes, she did.

1533
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,160
She slept in the cottage sometimes.

1534
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,160
She had moonlight picnics on the shore.'

1535
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,080
I noticed that Frank always called Rebecca
'she'.

1536
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,080
He never used her name.

1537
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,280
'Why is there a buoy in the bay?'

1538
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:07,840
I asked.

1539
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,680
'There's no boat there.

1540
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,480
What happened to it?

1541
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,680
Was it the boat Rebecca was sailing when she
died?'

1542
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,960
'Yes,' said Frank, quietly.

1543
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,000
'It turned over and sank.

1544
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,760
She was washed overboard and drowned.

1545
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,880
The sea is sometimes very rough in the bay.'

1546
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,160
'Couldn't anyone have helped her?'

1547
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:28,720
I asked.

1548
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,200
'Nobody saw the accident.

1549
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,080
Nobody knew she was sailing.

1550
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,760
She often went out alone like that.'

1551
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,480
'When did they find her?'

1552
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,360
I felt I must know everything now.

1553
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,760
I had been thinking about that terrible night
for so long.

1554
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,840
'They found her two months later.

1555
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,080
The sea had carried her forty miles up the
coast.

1556
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,640
Maxim had to identify the body.'

1557
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,160
Suddenly I was ashamed of all my questions.

1558
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:01,840
'Frank,' I said, 'I'm sorry I asked you all
those questions.

1559
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,000
But everything is so strange to me at Manderley.

1560
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:10,440
And when I meet anyone new, I know what they
are thinking: "How different she is from Rebecca."

1561
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,440
'

1562
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:16,400
'Mrs de Winter, you mustn't think that,' said
Frank, looking at me for the first time.

1563
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,520
'I am so glad you have married Maxim.

1564
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,000
It will make such a difference to his life.

1565
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,200
And Manderley needs someone like you, someone
young, fresh and charming.'

1566
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,680
'But Rebecca was so charming - and clever.

1567
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,680
People still remember her.'

1568
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,560
'Maxim would be very unhappy to hear you talking
like this, Mrs de Winter.

1569
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,680
Forget the past, as Maxim has done.

1570
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,840
None of us want to bring back the past.

1571
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,800
Your job here is to lead us away from it.'

1572
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,680
I was much happier now.

1573
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,480
But I had to ask Frank one more question.

1574
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,200
Tell me, Frank,' I said.

1575
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,840
'Was Rebecca very beautiful?'

1576
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,440
Frank turned away from me so that I could
not see his face.

1577
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,800
'Yes,' he said slowly.

1578
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:11,840
'Yes, I suppose she was the most beautiful
woman I ever saw in my life.'

1579
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:20,880
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1580
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,720
The China Cupid

1581
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:04,320
Frank had

1582
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,600
told me to forget the past.

1583
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,120
I wanted to.

1584
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,960
But Frank did not sit in the morning room
every day as I did.

1585
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,320
He did not sit at Rebecca's desk and touch
the things she had touched.

1586
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,600
Dear God, I did not want to think about Rebecca.

1587
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,440
I wanted to be happy.

1588
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,840
I wanted Maxim to be happy too.

1589
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,040
But Rebecca was always in my thoughts and
dreams.

1590
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,000
Beatrice, Maxim's sister, had promised to
give me a wedding present.

1591
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,600
She did not forget.

1592
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,840
One day, Robert brought a large parcel into
the morning-room where I was sitting alone.

1593
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,680
I cut the string excitedly and tore off the
dark brown paper.

1594
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,360
Beatrice had sent me four big books about
painting.

1595
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,600
She knew that I enjoyed sketching and she
had really tried to please me.

1596
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,680
I was glad to have something at Manderley
that belonged to me.

1597
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,720
I looked round the room for somewhere to put
the books.

1598
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,320
I stood them in a row on top of the desk and
looked at them.

1599
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,800
But the books were far too heavy.

1600
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,840
First one fell and then the others followed.

1601
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,400
A little china ornament which always stood
on the desk was knocked on to the floor.

1602
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,040
The ornament broke into many pieces.

1603
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,600
It was a beautiful little cupid and one of
the loveliest things in the house.

1604
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,720
I was suddenly very frightened.

1605
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,600
I found an envelope in a drawer and carefully
put the pieces of china into it.

1606
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,680
Then, like a child, I hid the envelope in
the desk.

1607
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:32,720
I decided to put my new books in the library
and I said nothing about the cupid.

1608
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:38,400
The following day, after lunch, Frith brought
our coffee to the library as usual.

1609
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,520
Instead of leaving, he stood by Maxim's chair.

1610
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,840
'Could I speak to you, sir?' he said.

1611
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,360
Maxim looked up from his paper.

1612
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,360
'Yes, Frith, what is it?'

1613
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,080
'It's about Robert, sir.

1614
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,760
He's very upset.

1615
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,800
Mrs Danvers has accused him of taking a valuable
ornament from the morning-room.

1616
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,240
Mrs Danvers noticed it was missing late this
morning.

1617
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,840
She says that Robert must have taken it or
broken it.

1618
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,640
Robert says he knows nothing about it.'

1619
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,400
'Perhaps it was one of the maids,' said Maxim.

1620
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,600
I knew he hated any kind of trouble with the
servants.

1621
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:16,820
'No, sir.

1622
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:21,120
No one except Robert has been in the room,
apart from Madam, of course.

1623
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,800
Mrs Danvers doesn't let the maids clean the
morning-room.'

1624
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,240
'Well, Mrs Danvers had better come and see
me.

1625
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,800
What ornament was it?'

1626
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
'The china cupid, sir.

1627
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,360
It stands on the desk.'

1628
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,160
'Oh dear,' said Maxim.

1629
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,760
'That's very valuable.

1630
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,640
It must be found.

1631
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,880
I'll see Mrs Danvers at once.'

1632
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,440
'Very good, sir,' said Frith and quietly left
the room.

1633
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:53,920
'Darling,' I said to Maxim when we were alone,
'I meant to tell you before, but I forgot.

1634
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,640
I broke the cupid yesterday.'

1635
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,480
'You broke it?

1636
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,440
Why didn't you say so when Frith was here?

1637
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,520
You'll have to explain to Mrs Danvers now.'

1638
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:04,820
'Oh no.

1639
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,880
Please, Maxim, you tell her.

1640
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,480
Let me go upstairs.'

1641
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,840
'Don't be silly,' said Maxim angrily.

1642
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,840
'Anyone would think you were afraid of Mrs
Danvers.'

1643
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,160
'I am afraid of her.

1644
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,840
At least not afraid, but...'

1645
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,160
The door opened without a sound and Mrs Danvers
came into the room.

1646
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,560
I looked nervously at Maxim.

1647
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,600
His face was half amused, half angry.

1648
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:33,280
'It's all a mistake, Mrs Danvers,' Maxim told
her.

1649
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,760
'Mrs de Winter broke the cupid herself.

1650
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,920
She forgot to tell us.'

1651
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,280
I felt like a child again.

1652
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,560
'I'm so sorry,' I said, 'I never thought Robert
would get into trouble.'

1653
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,240
'Is it possible to repair the cupid, Madam?'
said Mrs Danvers.

1654
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,640
She did not seem surprised.

1655
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,520
I felt she had known the truth all the time.

1656
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,560
'I'm afraid not,' I said.

1657
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,400
'It's in hundreds of pieces.'

1658
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:04,080
'What did you do with the pieces?' said Maxim.

1659
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,840
They are in an envelope in a drawer of the
writing desk.'

1660
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,040
'Find the pieces, Mrs Danvers.

1661
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,480
Try to get them mended in London.'

1662
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,400
'I never thought that Mrs de Winter had broken
the ornament,' said Mrs Danvers.

1663
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,720
As she left the room I could see the scorn
and hatred in her eyes.

1664
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,720
'I'm very sorry, darling,' I said.

1665
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,560
'It was very silly and careless of me.'

1666
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,520
'Forget it,' said Maxim.

1667
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,160
'But you do act strangely sometimes.

1668
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,560
More like a servant than 
the mistress of Manderley.

1669
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:41,600
Even when we have visitors, you sit on the
edge of your chair and say only "yes" and

1670
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,100
"no".'

1671
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,160
'I can't help being shy.'

1672
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,080
'I know you can't, darling.

1673
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:48,160
But you must learn to hide it.'

1674
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,000
'I do try.

1675
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,160
But I'm not used to this kind of life.

1676
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,440
People look at me and ask me so many questions.'

1677
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,760
'What does it matter?

1678
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,680
They are interested in us, that's all.'

1679
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,960
'They can't find me very interesting,' I said.

1680
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,280
'I suppose that's why you married me.

1681
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,360
You knew I was dull and quiet.

1682
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,600
No one would ever gossip about me.'

1683
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,520
Maxim threw his paper on the ground and got
up from his chair.

1684
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,120
His face was dark with anger and his voice
was hard.

1685
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:21,440
'What do you know about any gossip down here?'
he said.

1686
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,480
'Who's been talking to you?'

1687
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,080
'No one.

1688
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:24,800
No one at all.'

1689
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,120
Maxim stared at me.

1690
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:33,440
'Perhaps I did a very selfish thing when I
married you,' he said slowly.

1691
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,160
'I am so much older than you.'

1692
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,120
I felt cold and frightened.

1693
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,080
'Age doesn't matter,' I said.

1694
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,080
'I'm happy.

1695
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,640
You know I love you more than anything else
in the world.

1696
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,640
I love Manderley too.

1697
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,920
I love everything here.

1698
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,320
You're happy too, darling, aren't you?'

1699
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,040
Maxim did not answer.

1700
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,840
He stood staring out of the window.

1701
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,480
'If you don't think we're happy, you must
tell me,' I went on.

1702
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,840
'I don't want you to lie to me.'

1703
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,960
Maxim took my face in his hands.

1704
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,560
'How can I answer you?' he said.

1705
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,840
'If you are happy, then we are both happy.'

1706
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,200
He kissed me and walked across the room.

1707
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,160
'But you are disappointed in me.

1708
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,480
You think I am not right for Manderley.

1709
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,160
If only I hadn't broken that cupid.

1710
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,200
Was it very valuable?'

1711
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,720
'I think so,' Maxim answered.

1712
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:32,640
'It was a wedding present.

1713
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,120
Rebecca knew a lot about china.'

1714
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:40,320
Maxim went on staring straight in front of
him.

1715
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,480
He is thinking about Rebecca, I said to myself.

1716
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,120
I have broken one of their wedding presents.

1717
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,200
Maxim went back to his chair and picked up
his paper.

1718
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,240
I sat on the long seat under the window.

1719
01:25:53,600 --> 01:26:07,840
After a time, Jasper came to me and climbed
on to my lap.

1720
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,040
CHAPTER TWELVE

1721
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,640
In the West Wing

1722
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,920
Maxim had to go up to London at the end of
June.

1723
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,560
It was the first time that I had been left
alone at Manderley.

1724
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:29,200
I was sure that Maxim would have a terrible
accident or even be killed.

1725
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,440
I was too worried to eat any lunch.

1726
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,560
At about two o'clock, Robert brought me a
message.

1727
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,240
Maxim had arrived safely in London after a
good journey.

1728
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,160
I felt happy again and also rather hungry.

1729
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:46,080
I went back into the dining-room and took
an apple and some biscuits.

1730
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,840
Then I called Jasper and we went together
into the woods.

1731
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,240
As I sat there I felt happier than I had ever
been at Manderley.

1732
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,160
I could not understand it.

1733
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:00,640
I had not wanted Maxim to go to London, but
now I was glad to be alone.

1734
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,840
I walked through the Happy Valley to the bay.

1735
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,000
The sea was very calm.

1736
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,040
Jasper ran up the rocks leading to the next
bay.

1737
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,920
'Not that way, Jasper,' I called.

1738
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,840
The dog took no notice.

1739
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,120
Oh well, it doesn't matter, I thought.

1740
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:17,840
Maxim isn't here.

1741
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,880
And I climbed over the rocks after Jasper.

1742
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,800
The tide was out and there was very little
water in the bay.

1743
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,360
The white and green buoy was still there.

1744
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,840
I could read the name on it now: Je Reviens.

1745
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:35,440
A strange name for a boat - "I'll come back".

1746
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,240
And that boat would never come back now.

1747
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,160
I walked slowly across the beach to the cottage.

1748
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,840
The sun was shining today and the cottage
did not look frightening any more.

1749
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,000
I pushed open the door.

1750
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,320
Everything was exactly as before.

1751
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:55,840
There was a sound in the boat-house and Jasper
ran up to the doorway, barking angrily.

1752
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,320
'Is anybody there?'

1753
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:58,820
I said.

1754
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,320
I looked through the door and saw Ben sitting
by the wall.

1755
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,000
He looked very frightened.

1756
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,360
'I think you should come out,' I said.

1757
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,160
'Mr de Winter doesn't like people coming in
here.'

1758
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,840
Ben followed me out into the sunshine.

1759
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,080
'I'm not doing anything wrong,' he said.

1760
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,520
'You won't lock me up, will you?'

1761
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:24,880
His whole body was shaking with fear and tears
were rolling down his fat, round face.

1762
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,520
'I didn't do anything.

1763
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,760
I didn't tell anyone,' he said.

1764
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,440
'That's all right, Ben.

1765
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,280
No one's going to hurt you.

1766
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,760
But don't go into the cottage again.'

1767
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,680
Ben smiled.

1768
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,320
'You're not like the other one,' he said.

1769
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,920
'She was tall and dark.

1770
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,160
She had eyes like a snake.

1771
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,640
She came here at night.

1772
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,280
She saw me once, looking at her.

1773
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,600
"You'll be locked up.

1774
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,840
People will hurt you," she said.

1775
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,480
But you won't lock me up, will you?'

1776
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,360
'No, of course not, Ben,' I said.

1777
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,280
Ben smiled again and went off down the beach
to the sea.

1778
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,680
I went up towards the wood.

1779
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,080
Jasper followed me.

1780
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,680
When I looked back, Ben had gone.

1781
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,120
But I had a strange feeling that someone was
watching me.

1782
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:20,080
Someone tall and dark, who watched and listened.

1783
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,280
I started to run up the path and did not feel
safe until I reached the lawn.

1784
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,840
The house stood there, safe and secure.

1785
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:30,880
The sun shone on something metal in the drive.

1786
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,440
A green sports car was parked there.

1787
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:38,000
I had never seen it before and I hoped the
visitor did not want to stay to tea.

1788
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,920
As I walked across the lawn, I looked up at
the west wing.

1789
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,920
One of the shutters was open and a man stood
at the window.

1790
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,200
Then another figure, dressed in black, closed
the shutter.

1791
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,160
I was sure it was Mrs Danvers.

1792
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,120
But who was the man?

1793
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,320
And why had he come when Maxim was away in
London?

1794
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,960
I walked up the steps, through the hall and
into the morning-room.

1795
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,040
I could smell cigarette smoke.

1796
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,720
Then I heard voices and, without thinking,
I hid behind the door.

1797
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:12,000
I heard Mrs Danvers say, 'I expect she went
into the library.

1798
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,120
Wait here while I go and see.'

1799
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,000
She was talking about me of course.

1800
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,680
I did not know what to do.

1801
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,360
Jasper had moved towards the drawing-room,
wagging his tail.

1802
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,960
'Hallo, Jasper, old boy,' said a man's voice
and Jasper ran back into the morning-room.

1803
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,560
The man followed.

1804
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,880
He saw me standing behind the door.

1805
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,240
I have never seen anyone more surprised.

1806
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:39,200
'I beg your pardon,' the man said, looking
down at me with a rather unpleasant smile.

1807
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:44,560
He was a big, handsome man, but his face was
red and his eyes were a hard blue.

1808
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,640
His breath smelt of whisky.

1809
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,600
'I'm so sorry,' he said.

1810
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,200
'I called to see Danny.

1811
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:52,560
She's an old friend of mine.'

1812
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,360
He lit a cigarette and looked round the room.

1813
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,080
'How's old Max?' he asked.

1814
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,840
'Maxim's very well, he's in London,' I said.

1815
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:03,280
'What?

1816
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:04,560
He's left you all alone?

1817
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,760
That's not fair, is it?'

1818
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,400
The man gave an unpleasant laugh.

1819
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,080
I did not like him at all.

1820
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:12,880
At that moment, Mrs Danvers came back.

1821
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,160
She looked at me angrily.

1822
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:21,040
'Well, Danny,' the man said, 'aren't you going
to introduce me to the new bride?'

1823
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,280
'This is Mr Favell, Madam,' said Mrs Danvers.

1824
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:27,200
'How do you do?'

1825
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,080
I said politely.

1826
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,840
'Will you stay to tea?'

1827
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,600
The man laughed again.

1828
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,520
'Now isn't that kind, Danny,' he said.

1829
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,200
'But I had better be going.

1830
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,760
Come and look at my car,' he said to me.

1831
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,600
'It's a good car.

1832
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,840
Much faster than the one Max has.'

1833
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,360
I did not like the way that Favell spoke about
Maxim.

1834
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,880
I did not want to look at his car.

1835
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,040
But I followed him out into the hall.

1836
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,040
'Goodbye, Danny.

1837
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:53,920
Take care of yourself.

1838
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,840
You know my telephone number.'

1839
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:00,640
'Dear old Manderley,' Favell said as we walked
out of the house.

1840
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:02,160
'What do you think of it?

1841
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,160
Aren't you lonely living here?'

1842
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,280
'I'm very fond of Manderley,' I said.

1843
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,840
'I have enjoyed meeting you,' Favell said,
standing by his car.

1844
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,280
'But I'd rather you didn't tell Max about
my visit.

1845
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,400
I'm afraid your husband doesn't like me very
much.

1846
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,280
He might be cross with poor old Danny.'

1847
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,160
'No, all right,' I said awkwardly.

1848
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,920
'I won't say anything to Maxim.'

1849
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,040
He got into the car and started the engine.

1850
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,080
'That's very kind,' he said.

1851
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,400
'Perhaps I'll come back and see you one day.

1852
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:36,900
Goodbye.'

1853
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,480
Favell drove away noisily and much too fast.

1854
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,800
I walked slowly back to the house.

1855
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,880
Mrs Danvers had gone.

1856
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,040
I wondered who Favell was.

1857
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,680
He had certainly been to Manderley before.

1858
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:54,160
And, like Rebecca, he called Maxim 'Max'.

1859
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,520
Had Favell known Rebecca?

1860
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:57,760
What had he been doing in the west wing?

1861
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,640
There were some very valuable things in the
house.

1862
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:01,920
Perhaps the man was a thief.

1863
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,800
I decided to go up to the west wing.

1864
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,840
I must see that everything was all right.

1865
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:10,800
The house seemed very quiet as I began to
walk up the stairs.

1866
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:14,080
My heart was beating in a strange, excited
way.

1867
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:20,240
I was again in the corridor where I had stood
on my first morning at Manderley.

1868
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,600
I turned the handle of the nearest door and
went inside.

1869
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,520
Everything was dark.

1870
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,760
I found the light and switched it on.

1871
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,400
I was surprised to see that the room was  

1872
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,360
completely
furnished.

1873
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,480
There was no dust and everything was clean
and tidy.

1874
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,200
The room, a bedroom, was the most beautiful
I had ever seen.

1875
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:43,760
There were flowers on the dressing table and
on the table beside the bed.

1876
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,720
A satin dressing-gown lay on a chair.

1877
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,840
There was a pair of slippers under a chair.

1878
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:52,640
I walked slowly into the middle of the room.

1879
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,760
No, it was not used.

1880
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,200
It was not lived in any more.

1881
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,200
The air was not fresh.

1882
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:03,840
Rebecca would never come back to this room
again.

1883
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,440
I could hear the sea clearly.

1884
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,080
I went to the window and opened a shutter.

1885
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:13,200
Yes, I was standing at the window where I
had seen Mrs Danvers and Favell.

1886
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,920
I felt afraid and my legs began to tremble.

1887
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,080
I sat down on the stool by the dressing-table.

1888
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:24,000
I looked round the room, the most beautiful
in Manderley.

1889
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,080
A room that was never used now.

1890
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,960
I got up and went to the chair.

1891
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:32,080
I touched the satin dressing-gown.

1892
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,320
I picked up the slippers and held them in
my hand.

1893
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,360
On the bed lay Rebecca's nightdress.

1894
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:41,280
I went to the bed and held the nightdress
to my face.

1895
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:45,840
It was cold and smelt of the flowers in the
Happy Valley.

1896
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,680
As I stood looking down at the bed, I heard
a step behind me.

1897
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,680
I turned quickly.

1898
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:52,720
It was Mrs Danvers.

1899
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,680
I shall never forget the look on her face.

1900
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,840
It was a look of strange, terrible excitement.

1901
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,440
She came nearer and I could feel her breath
on my face.

1902
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,200
'Is there anything the matter, Madam?

1903
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:09,280
Are you feeling unwell?'

1904
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,520
Mrs Danvers said quietly.

1905
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,360
'I did not expect to see you here, Mrs Danvers.

1906
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,240
I came up to fasten one of the shutters.'

1907
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,480
'I will fasten it,' Mrs Danvers said.

1908
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,400
Mrs Danvers came back from the window and
stood beside me.

1909
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,840
'You opened the shutter yourself, didn't you?'

1910
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:30,900
she said.

1911
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,680
'You wanted to see this room, didn't you?

1912
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,520
Now you are here, let me show you everything.'

1913
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,840
Her voice now was as soft and sweet as honey.

1914
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:44,080
'It's a lovely room, isn't it?

1915
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,000
That was her bed.

1916
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,400
I keep it just as it was.

1917
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:50,640
This was her nightdress.

1918
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,520
She was wearing it the night before she died.

1919
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,840
These are her slippers.'

1920
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,800
Mrs Danvers put the slippers back under the
chair and walked across the room to a large

1921
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,360
wardrobe.

1922
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,320
'All her evening clothes are here.

1923
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:05,920
Her furs, too.

1924
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,640
Mr de Winter was always buying clothes for
her, beautiful clothes.'

1925
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,280
Mrs Danvers held my arm tightly with her long
thin fingers.

1926
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,760
Her eyes looked deep into mine.

1927
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,240
'I blame myself for the accident,' she said.

1928
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,560
'I was out that evening.

1929
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,240
When I came in, I heard she had gone down
to the bay.

1930
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:30,000
I was worried.

1931
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,320
The wind was blowing hard.

1932
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,120
Mr de Winter came in at about eleven.

1933
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,360
The wind was blowing harder, and still she
had not come back.

1934
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,880
'I sat on my bed until after five.

1935
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,120
Then I put on my coat and went down to the
bay.

1936
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,680
I saw at once that the boat had gone.'

1937
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,160
Mrs Danvers' hand fell back to her side.

1938
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:54,800
'That is why Mr de Winter doesn't use these
rooms any more.

1939
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:56,960
Listen to the sea.'

1940
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:03,040
Even with the shutters and windows closed,
I could hear the dull, harsh sound of the

1941
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:03,760
sea in the bay.

1942
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:09,200
'I come into these room and dust them every
day,' Mrs Danvers said.

1943
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,080
'If you want to come again, ask me.

1944
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,320
No one comes here but me.

1945
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,880
'Sometimes I feel she is standing here, behind
me.

1946
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,720
I feel her everywhere.

1947
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,440
In the morning-room and in the hall.

1948
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,560
You feel her too, don't you?'

1949
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,680
I tried to smile, but I felt sick and ill.

1950
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,280
'Do you think she can see us now?'

1951
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,280
Mrs Danvers asked me.

1952
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,720
'Do you think the dead watch the living?'

1953
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,680
'I don't know,' I said.

1954
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:44,960
'I don't know.'

1955
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:53,440
'Sometimes I think she watches you and Mr
de Winter together,' Mrs Danvers whispered.

1956
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:57,040
We stood there by the door, staring at one
another.

1957
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,080
I could not take my eyes away from hers.

1958
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:03,120
Then I turned and walked into the corridor.

1959
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,320
I went down the stairs and through the door
to the east wing.

1960
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,120
I pushed open the door to my own bedroom.

1961
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,120
I shut the door of the room and locked it.

1962
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:14,640
Then I lay down on my bed and closed my eyes.

1963
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:29,840
I felt terribly sick.

1964
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:34,720
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1965
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:36,720
More About Jack Favell

1966
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,240
Maxim rang up the next morning.

1967
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,840
I heard the phone ring while I was having
breakfast and Frith answered it.

1968
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,520
I hoped that Maxim would ask for me but he
did not.

1969
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:52,720
'Mr de Winter will be back at about six this
evening,' Frith told me.

1970
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:54,560
'All right, Frith.

1971
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:55,920
Thank you,' I said.

1972
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,440
I went on eating breakfast as slowly as I
could.

1973
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,520
Jasper was sitting at my feet.

1974
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,080
I wondered what I should do all day.

1975
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,880
I had slept badly.

1976
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,800
I could not forget my visit to the west wing.

1977
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,240
I knew now how much Mrs Danvers hated me.

1978
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,760
About ten o'clock, the telephone rang again.

1979
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,600
This time it was Beatrice.

1980
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:20,560
'Well, my dear, how are you?'

1981
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:21,120
she said.

1982
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,880
'Shall I come and have lunch with you today?'

1983
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,560
'I'd like you to come very much, Beatrice,'
I said.

1984
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,400
'All right, my dear.

1985
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,120
See you later.'

1986
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,560
I put the phone down.

1987
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,640
I was glad that Beatrice was coming.

1988
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:36,320
It gave me something to look forward to.

1989
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,800
I wandered out on to the lawn.

1990
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,960
I felt different from yesterday.

1991
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,200
I wanted Maxim to come home.

1992
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:47,120
I tried not to remember my visit to the west
wing.

1993
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:50,720
But I could not stop thinking about Favell
and his friendship with Mrs Danvers.

1994
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:54,080
I began to feel that Mrs Danvers was watching
me.

1995
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:57,680
There were so many rooms that Maxim and I
never used.

1996
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:01,280
It was easy for Mrs Danvers to watch me from
one of their windows.

1997
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:05,200
Beatrice arrived by car at about half past
twelve.

1998
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,840
This time I went out to the drive to meet
her.

1999
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,840
'Well, my dear, here I am,' she said.

2000
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,120
'It's a lovely day, isn't it?'

2001
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,160
She gave me a kiss and then 
looked at me carefully.

2002
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,360
'You don't look well,' Beatrice said.

2003
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:20,960
'You are much too thin.

2004
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:22,560
Your face is pale, too.

2005
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,520
What's wrong with you?'

2006
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:25,520
'Nothing,' I said.

2007
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,360
'My face is always pale.'

2008
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:32,000
'You looked quite different when I saw you
before,' Beatrice told me.

2009
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,520
'You are not going to have a baby, are you?'

2010
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,320
'No, I don't think so,' I said.

2011
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:38,560
'Well, I hope you will sometime.

2012
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,880
Maxim would be so happy to have a son.

2013
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:43,280
What have you been doing with yourself?

2014
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,880
Have you done much sketching?

2015
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,560
Did you like the books I sent you?

2016
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:47,760
Have you had anyone to stay?'

2017
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:52,000
I had forgotten that Beatrice asked so many
questions.

2018
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,480
'No, we've had no one to stay.

2019
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:56,880
People come to tea sometimes, of course.'

2020
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,760
I wondered whether to tell Beatrice about
Mrs Danvers' visitor, Favell.

2021
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:05,120
I did not want Beatrice to tell Maxim about
the visit.

2022
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,760
But I did want to find out more about the
man.

2023
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,920
'Have you ever heard of a man called Jack
Favell, Beatrice?'

2024
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:12,560
I asked her.

2025
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:16,560
'Jack Favell?' said Beatrice slowly.

2026
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:19,280
'Yes, I do know the name.

2027
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,400
Wait a minute - Jack Favell.

2028
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,680
Yes, of course.

2029
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:24,880
I remember him now.

2030
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,480
He's an awful man.

2031
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,840
I met him once, years ago.'

2032
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:31,360
'He was here yesterday,' I told her.

2033
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,800
'He came to see Mrs Danvers.'

2034
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:34,960
Beatrice did not look at me.

2035
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,440
'Oh well,' she said, 'I suppose he knows Mrs
Danvers quite well.'

2036
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,200
'But why?'

2037
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:41,840
I asked.

2038
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:45,840
'Jack Favell is Rebecca's cousin,' Beatrice
said.

2039
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,440
'I think he came to Manderley quite a lot
when Rebecca was alive.

2040
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,080
I'm not sure.'

2041
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,200
'I did not like him,' I said.

2042
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:57,200
'No, I don't suppose that you did,' Beatrice
answered.

2043
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:01,520
I hoped that she would tell me more about
Favell, but she did not.

2044
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,320
For the rest of the time we talked about other
things.

2045
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,840
Beatrice stayed for tea and left soon afterwards.

2046
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,880
She had promised to meet her husband, Giles,
at the station.

2047
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:16,560
'I hope you won't be so thin next time I see
you,' Beatrice said as she got into her car.

2048
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:18,480
'Give Maxim my love.

2049
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,040
Look after him, and look after yourself, too.'

2050
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,640
I watched Beatrice's car go down the drive.

2051
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:28,000
Maxim would not be back for another hour.

2052
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,160
I did not feel like sitting in the house by
myself.

2053
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:33,840
I called Jasper and we went for a walk through
the woods.

2054
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,200
But I did not go near the sea.

2055
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:38,640
I missed Maxim now and felt lonely without
him.

2056
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,840
Beatrice's questions had made me feel tired
too.

2057
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,720
When I came back from my walk, I saw Maxim's
car standing in front of the house.

2058
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,040
At once, I felt much happier.

2059
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,920
I ran quickly up the steps and into the hall.

2060
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:56,320
As I walked towards the library, I heard the
sound of voices.

2061
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:00,160
One voice was Maxim's, very loud and angry.

2062
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,800
The door was shut, but I could hear what he
said.

2063
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,160
'You can tell Favell to keep away from Manderley.

2064
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:08,560
Tell him I said so,' Maxim was saying.

2065
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,400
'I know he was here.

2066
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:11,840
Never mind who told me.

2067
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,520
His car was seen here yesterday.

2068
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,760
If you want to meet him, meet him somewhere
else.

2069
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,320
I don't want that man at Manderley.

2070
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,920
I won't even have him in the gardens.

2071
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:21,600
I'm telling you for the last time.'

2072
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:23,840
I heard footsteps.

2073
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,560
I ran quickly up the stairs and hid myself.

2074
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,200
Mrs Danvers came out of the library.

2075
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,440
She shut the door and walked up the stairs.

2076
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:35,520
Her face was grey with anger and the look
in her eyes frightened me.

2077
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:38,080
Thank God she did not know I was watching
her.

2078
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,200
Mrs Danvers went through the door to the west
wing.

2079
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:45,520
I waited a moment and then went downstairs
and into the library.

2080
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,840
Maxim was standing by the window.

2081
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,720
When he heard the door open, he turned round
quickly.

2082
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,360
I smiled and held out my hand to him.

2083
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,080
'Oh, it's you,' Maxim said.

2084
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,720
I could tell that he was very angry.

2085
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:01,120
His face was white and his mouth hard.

2086
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:02,400
I took his hand in mine.

2087
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,360
'I missed you so much,' I said.

2088
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,640
'I hate being here without you.'

2089
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,020
'Do you?'

2090
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,280
Maxim said.

2091
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:12,560
He did not say anything about Mrs Danvers
or Favell.

2092
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,760
'Are you worried about something?'

2093
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:16,320
I asked.

2094
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:20,320
'I've had a long day,' Maxim answered.

2095
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,480
'And London was very hot and noisy.

2096
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:23,600
I always hate going there.'

2097
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:27,200
Maxim lit a cigarette and moved away from
me.

2098
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:31,760
I knew then that he was not going to tell
me about his anger with Mrs Danvers.

2099
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:37,120
Maxim still thought of me as a child - someone
who must not hear unpleasant things.

2100
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:38,960
But he was wrong.

2101
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,480
I felt I was growing up a little more every
day.

2102
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:47,840
My life at Manderley was turning me into a
woman.

2103
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:55,680
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

2104
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,760
Preparations for the Ball

2105
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:04,080
It was on a Sunday afternoon when someone
spoke about the Fancy Dress Ball again.

2106
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:09,280
Frank Crawley had come to lunch and the three
of us were hoping to have a quiet afternoon.

2107
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:14,480
But as we were walking out to the big tree
on the lawn, we heard a car in the drive.

2108
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,920
We had to go back into the house to welcome
the visitors.

2109
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:22,000
Very soon, more people arrived and then some
more.

2110
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,720
They all stayed to tea, of course.

2111
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:29,920
As we sat in the drawing-room eating cake
and sandwiches, one of our visitors suddenly

2112
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:32,960
said to Maxim, 'Oh, Mr de Winter.

2113
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,400
There is something I must ask you.

2114
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:37,600
Are you having a Fancy Dress Ball at Manderley
this year?'

2115
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,160
Maxim answered quietly.

2116
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,040
'I haven't thought about it,' he said.

2117
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,680
'And I don't think anyone else has, either.'

2118
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,280
'Oh, but you are wrong,' said another woman.

2119
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:50,720
'We have all been thinking about it.

2120
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,440
We used to enjoy the Manderley Ball so much.'

2121
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,640
'Well, I don't know,' said Maxim.

2122
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,640
'There would be a great deal to do.

2123
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,760
You had better ask Frank Crawley.

2124
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:02,880
He would do most of the work.'

2125
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:07,680
'I don't mind the work,' said Frank, looking
at me.

2126
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:11,840
'It's for Maxim and Mrs de Winter to decide.'

2127
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,720
Everyone looked at me and started to talk
at once.

2128
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,080
'Now, Mrs de Winter, you must help us.

2129
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,000
Your husband will listen to you.

2130
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,920
After all, you are a new bride.

2131
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,040
The Ball will be for you.'

2132
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:27,280
'Yes, of course,' said a man, 'we all missed
your wedding.

2133
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:30,080
There ought to be some kind of party here
at Manderley.'

2134
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,200
Everyone laughed and clapped their hands.

2135
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:35,440
Maxim looked at me.

2136
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,280
'What about you?

2137
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,840
Would you like it?' he said.

2138
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,720
I did not know what Maxim was thinking.

2139
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,520
Perhaps he thought I was too shy to want the
Ball.

2140
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,080
'I think I rather like the idea,' I said with
a smile.

2141
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,080
Maxim turned away.

2142
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,560
'All right, then, Frank.

2143
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,000
We'll have the dance.

2144
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,360
Mrs Danvers can help you.

2145
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,880
She will know what to do.

2146
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:03,200
Now, if we've all finished tea, we'll go into
the garden.'

2147
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:05,760
We all went outside.

2148
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,520
Our visitors were talking happily now about
their costumes for the Ball.

2149
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,520
I felt excited too.

2150
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:13,920
'What will you wear?'

2151
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:14,800
I said to Maxim.

2152
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:18,240
'I never wear fancy dress,' Maxim replied.

2153
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:21,840
'I'm the host, so I can do as I like.'

2154
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,200
'What shall I wear?'

2155
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:24,560
I said.

2156
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:25,680
'I've no idea at all.'

2157
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:27,760
Maxim smiled at me.

2158
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,840
'If you look pretty, I don't mind what you
put on,' he told me.

2159
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:33,760
'All right,' I said.

2160
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,240
'My costume will be a secret.

2161
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,840
I shall keep it as a surprise.'

2162
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,440
Maxim laughed and patted me on the shoulder.

2163
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:44,240
As usual, he was treating me like a child.

2164
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:46,560
I did not want to be a child.

2165
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,840
I wanted to be a grown-up woman.

2166
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,200
I shall wear a beautiful dress at the Ball,
I told myself.

2167
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,600
Everyone will say how charming I am.

2168
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,280
They will think of me as the real Mrs de Winter
at last.

2169
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:03,840
Maxim will love me as his wife and forget
about Rebecca.

2170
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:09,600
Soon everyone at Manderley was talking about
the Fancy Dress Ball.

2171
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,400
My little maid, Clarice, spoke of nothing
else.

2172
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,800
'Oh, Madam, it's so exciting,' she said.

2173
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,560
'I'm looking forward to it so much.'

2174
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,120
The preparations went on.

2175
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,320
Frank was very busy and so was Mrs Danvers.

2176
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,280
I saw very little of her, and I was glad.

2177
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:31,040
I began to get worried about my costume.

2178
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,320
I did not know what to wear.

2179
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:35,440
I looked through the books that Beatrice had
given me.

2180
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:39,600
I made sketches of some of the costumes, but
I did not like any of them.

2181
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:43,040
I wanted something that was pretty and simple
too.

2182
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:48,400
That evening, as I was getting ready for dinner,
there was a knock at my bedroom door.

2183
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,520
To my surprise, it was Mrs Danvers.

2184
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:54,000
She was holding a piece of paper in her hand.

2185
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:58,000
It was a drawing of a costume which I had
sketched and then thrown away.

2186
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,920
'I found this, Madam,' Mrs Danvers said.

2187
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,720
'I thought you had thrown it away by mistake.'

2188
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,680
'No, Mrs Danvers, I don't want it, thank you,'
I said quickly.

2189
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:13,840
I hoped she would go, but she stood at the
door.

2190
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:19,760
'So you haven't decided what to wear, Madam,'
Mrs Danvers said in a friendly voice.

2191
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:23,520
'No, I haven't decided yet,' I replied.

2192
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:28,960
'Perhaps you could copy one of the pictures
in the gallery,' Mrs Danvers suggested.

2193
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,760
'Many of them would make beautiful costumes.

2194
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,000
What does Mr de Winter think?'

2195
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,480
'I don't know,' I said.

2196
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:38,400
'I wanted to surprise him.

2197
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:42,240
I was going to keep my costume a secret.'

2198
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:44,480
Mrs Danvers looked pleased at my words.

2199
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:49,440
'Then I suggest that you have your costume
made in London, Madam.

2200
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,720
There is a shop in Bond Street that would
do it really well.

2201
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:58,800
I have always liked the picture of the girl
in white,' Mrs Danvers went on in the same

2202
01:49:58,800 --> 01:49:59,520
friendly way.

2203
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:03,120
'The picture is about two hundred years old.

2204
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,520
The girl's wearing a very simple dress.

2205
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,920
It would be easy to copy.'

2206
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:10,560
I did not know what to say.

2207
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,040
I knew the picture well.

2208
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,120
I wished I had thought of the idea myself.

2209
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:18,400
'Thank you, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

2210
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:21,440
Mrs Danvers went out quietly.

2211
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:23,840
I wondered why she was so friendly.

2212
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:27,200
Perhaps Maxim's anger had frightened her a
little.

2213
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:31,840
As I went down to dinner, I stopped in front
of the picture of the young girl.

2214
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:36,720
Her name was Caroline de Winter and she had
been famous for her beauty.

2215
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:41,680
The dress was very simple, with short sleeves
and a long, full skirt.

2216
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:43,920
Her hair was in curls.

2217
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,800
I would have to wear a wig over my own straight
hair.

2218
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:48,960
I felt very excited.

2219
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,840
I was glad that I had chosen my costume at
last.

2220
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:53,920
I said nothing to Maxim.

2221
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:56,960
The next day I made a sketch of the picture.

2222
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:01,200
Then I sent the drawing to the shop in London
with careful instructions about the dress

2223
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:01,760
and the wig.

2224
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:06,160
The preparations for the great day went on.

2225
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:07,840
No one expected me to do anything.

2226
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,800
Slowly, the great house began to change.

2227
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,800
Furniture was moved as the great hall was
prepared for dancing.

2228
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,520
Coloured lights were hung in the trees outside.

2229
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:19,840
There were flowers everywhere.

2230
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:24,400
Hundreds of them were brought in from the
garden and Mrs Danvers knew exactly how to

2231
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:24,960
arrange them.

2232
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:27,680
Manderley took on a new beauty.

2233
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:33,840
I had never seen the old house looking so
lovely.

2234
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:41,200
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

2235
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,280
Miss Caroline de Winter

2236
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:48,240
On the day of the Ball, Maxim and I had lunch
with Frank.

2237
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:51,920
My dress and the wig had arrived and they
both looked perfect.

2238
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:56,080
Maxim and Frank asked me about my costume
but I told them nothing.

2239
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,200
The secret made me feel excited and important.

2240
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,640
'You won't know it's me,' I told them.

2241
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:04,720
'You will both have the surprise of your lives.'

2242
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,920
Maxim and I went back to the house after lunch.

2243
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:10,720
The band had arrived and we welcomed the men.

2244
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,760
The afternoon seemed very long.

2245
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,200
I thought about going for a walk.

2246
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:20,240
Then suddenly, it was tea-time and Beatrice
and her husband, Giles, had arrived.

2247
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:24,640
'This is like old times,' said Beatrice, looking
around.

2248
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,960
'Everything is as beautiful as ever.

2249
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:28,880
What's everyone going to wear?

2250
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,920
I suppose you refuse to wear fancy dress,
Maxim?'

2251
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:34,720
'Of course,' Maxim said.

2252
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:35,920
'I prefer to be comfortable.'

2253
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:39,440
'I'm going to dress as an Arab,' said Giles.

2254
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:40,800
'I got the idea from a friend.'

2255
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,840
'What about you, Mrs Lacy?'

2256
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:44,960
Frank said to Beatrice.

2257
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:47,280
'I'm in Eastern dress, too.

2258
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,680
I'm wearing a veil and lots of jewellery.

2259
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,200
I'll be cool and comfortable.

2260
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,080
That's all that matters.'

2261
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,080
Beatrice turned to me.

2262
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,880
'And what is our hostess going to wear?'

2263
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:57,920
she asked.

2264
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,920
'The Ball is for you, after all.

2265
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,160
We all expect you to wear something really
special.'

2266
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,960
'Don't ask her,' said Maxim.

2267
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,400
'She won't tell anyone.

2268
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:07,840
She's had the dress made in London.'

2269
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:10,640
'It's quite simple really,' I said.

2270
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,840
'What fun it all is,' said Beatrice.

2271
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,200
'I'm getting excited already.'

2272
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:19,280
'You've got her to thank for it,' said Maxim,
smiling at me.

2273
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,160
Everyone looked at me and smiled.

2274
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,320
I felt pleased and happy.

2275
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:29,600
This Ball was for me because I was a bride,
the new Mrs de Winter.

2276
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:34,320
Manderley had been made into a place of light
and beauty, just for me.

2277
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:36,480
'What's the time?'

2278
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:37,360
I said.

2279
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:40,240
'I think we ought to be getting ready.'

2280
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:43,840
I found Clarice waiting for me in my bedroom,
her face full of excitement.

2281
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,200
I locked the door and took the dress from
its box.

2282
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:48,720
It fitted perfectly.

2283
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:50,960
I looked at myself in the mirror.

2284
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:52,400
I smiled.

2285
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,400
I felt different already.

2286
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:58,160
I was someone more exciting and interesting
than my usual self.

2287
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:00,640
'Give me the wig, Clarice,' I said.

2288
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,200
'Be careful, the curls mustn't be flat.'

2289
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:06,320
I brushed back my own straight hair.

2290
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:08,800
Carefully, I put the wig in place.

2291
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:10,880
I looked in the mirror again.

2292
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:15,520
The wig and the tightly fitting dress made
me almost beautiful.

2293
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:18,720
'Oh, Clarice,' I said.

2294
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:20,080
'What will Mr de Winter say?'

2295
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:22,240
There was a knock on the door.

2296
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:23,680
'Who's there?'

2297
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:24,640
I called.

2298
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,440
'You can't come in.'

2299
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:29,360
'It's me, my dear,' said Beatrice.

2300
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:30,320
'Are you ready?

2301
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:31,520
I want to have a look at you.'

2302
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:36,000
'No, no,' I said, 'you can't come in.

2303
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,240
Tell Maxim that he can't come in either.

2304
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:39,680
I'll come down when I'm ready.'

2305
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:42,560
I looked in the mirror again.

2306
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:47,440
My eyes looked larger and the curls made a
soft cloud round my head.

2307
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:50,400
I lifted the skirt of the dress in my hands.

2308
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:54,160
'Unlock the door,' I said to Clarice.

2309
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:54,880
'I'm going down.'

2310
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,880
I stood in the gallery and looked down on
the hall below.

2311
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:02,400
There was Giles in his white Arab costume.

2312
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,960
Beatrice was wearing a long green dress.

2313
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,960
Frank was dressed as a sailor.

2314
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,840
Only Maxim was wearing evening clothes.

2315
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,440
'I don't know what she's doing,' I heard Maxim
say.

2316
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:15,440
'What's the time, Frank?

2317
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:18,160
She must be down soon.'

2318
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:20,320
I looked up at the picture of Caroline de
Winter.

2319
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:25,760
Yes, her dress was exactly like mine and she
had the same curled hair.

2320
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:28,640
The band was playing softly in the gallery.

2321
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:33,920
'Beat the drum,' I said, 'and call out: Miss
Caroline de Winter.'

2322
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:36,240
The drum sounded.

2323
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:37,680
Everyone looked up.

2324
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:43,040
'Miss Caroline de Winter,' the man shouted.

2325
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,840
I stood at the top of the stairs, smiling.

2326
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:49,760
I expected everyone to laugh and clap as I
walked down the stairs.

2327
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:51,840
Nobody laughed.

2328
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:53,520
Nobody clapped.

2329
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,160
They all stared at me without moving.

2330
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:58,640
I smiled at Maxim.

2331
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,280
'How do you do, Mr de Winter?'

2332
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:01,780
I said.

2333
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:04,160
Maxim stared up at me.

2334
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:06,640
His face was completely white.

2335
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:08,560
Something was wrong.

2336
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,800
Why was Maxim looking like that?

2337
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,240
He moved towards the stairs.

2338
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,720
'What the hell do you think you're doing?'
he said.

2339
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,200
His eyes were on fire with anger.

2340
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:21,760
'It's the picture,' I said.

2341
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:22,800
'The one in the gallery.'

2342
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:25,440
There was a long silence.

2343
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:28,240
Still nobody moved.

2344
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:28,800
'What is it?'

2345
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:30,000
I said.

2346
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:30,800
'What have I done?'

2347
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:35,440
When Maxim answered, his voice was cold and
hard.

2348
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:37,920
'Go and take off that dress!

2349
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:39,840
It doesn't matter what you wear.

2350
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:40,880
Any evening dress will do.

2351
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:42,640
Go quickly, before anyone comes.'

2352
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:45,360
I could not speak.

2353
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:48,080
I stood staring at Maxim.

2354
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,600
'What are you standing there for?' he asked
me.

2355
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:52,880
'Didn't you hear what I said?'

2356
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,400
I turned and ran up the stairs.

2357
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:58,960
My eyes were full of tears.

2358
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:00,960
I did not know what I was doing.

2359
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,600
The door to the west wing was open.

2360
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,920
Mrs Danvers was standing there.

2361
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:10,320
I shall never forget the terrible look on
her face.

2362
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:14,720
It was a look of joy - of joy and the most
terrible hate.

2363
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:17,840
She stood there, smiling at me.

2364
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:23,840
Then I ran from her, back to my room, tripping
and nearly falling over my long skirt.

2365
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:26,560
Clarice was waiting for me in my bedroom.

2366
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:28,800
She had heard what had happened.

2367
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,920
When she saw my face, Clarice started to cry.

2368
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:35,280
'It doesn't matter, Clarice,' I said.

2369
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,640
'Help me take off this dress.

2370
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:38,160
Quickly.'

2371
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:39,520
'What will you wear, Madam?'

2372
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:41,360
Clarice asked me.

2373
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:42,880
'I don't know,' I said.

2374
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:44,720
'Leave me alone now.

2375
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,400
I'll be all right.

2376
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:48,960
Go down and enjoy the party.

2377
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,840
Don't tell anyone what has happened.'

2378
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:55,760
After Clarice had gone, someone knocked at
the door.

2379
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,080
It opened and Beatrice came in.

2380
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:01,600
'My dear,' she said, 'are you all right?'

2381
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:04,560
I put a hand up to my head and took off the
wig.

2382
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:09,200
'Of course I knew at once that it was a mistake,'
Beatrice said.

2383
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:10,320
'You could not have known.'

2384
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:12,640
'Known what?'

2385
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:14,080
I said, turning to look at her.

2386
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,120
'Why, about your costume.

2387
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:20,640
It was exactly what Rebecca wore at the last
Fancy Dress Ball here.

2388
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:24,560
As you stood on the stairs, I thought for
one terrible moment...'

2389
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,080
'I ought to have known,' I said.

2390
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:30,880
I was thinking of Mrs Danvers.

2391
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:33,840
She had planned this.

2392
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,440
She had known what would happen.

2393
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:39,040
'How could you know?' said Beatrice.

2394
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:41,760
'But it was a terrible shock to Maxim.

2395
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,240
He thinks that you did it as a joke.

2396
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:47,840
He thinks that is why you kept your dress
a secret.

2397
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:50,000
But he will understand when you speak to him.

2398
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:53,040
I'm going to tell everyone that your dress
didn't fit.'

2399
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:55,360
I did not say anything.

2400
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:58,240
'Now, what can you wear?'

2401
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:58,880
Beatrice said.

2402
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:01,600
'Here, this blue dress is very pretty.

2403
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:02,240
Put this on.'

2404
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:04,320
'No,' I said.

2405
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:05,760
'I'm not going down.'

2406
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:08,800
Beatrice stared at me before she spoke.

2407
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:12,000
'But, my dear, you must.

2408
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,280
It will look so strange.'

2409
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:15,840
I felt very tired.

2410
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,160
'What does it matter?'

2411
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:18,660
I said.

2412
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:21,600
Beatrice looked shocked at my words.

2413
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:23,680
'Think of Maxim.

2414
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,320
You must come down for him,' she said.

2415
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:30,480
'I can't, I can't,' I answered.

2416
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:32,800
Beatrice stared at me.

2417
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,640
'I must go down now,' she said at last.

2418
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:38,160
'They will be waiting for me at dinner.

2419
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:41,200
I'll tell Maxim you'll be down in a minute,
shall I?'

2420
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:46,320
I did not answer and Beatrice walked slowly
to the door and went out.

2421
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:50,960
After a long time I got up from the bed where
I was sitting.

2422
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:53,120
I walked across to the window.

2423
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
I could see the coloured lights in the trees.

2424
01:59:57,120 --> 02:00:01,280
I walked back to the dressing-table and looked
at my white face and red eyes in the mirror.

2425
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:04,880
Then slowly I washed my face and combed my
hair.

2426
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,400
I put the white dress and the wig back into
the box.

2427
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:12,160
I never wanted to see them again.

2428
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:14,000
I picked up the blue dress and put it on.

2429
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:18,480
When I was ready, I opened the door and walked
along the corridor.

2430
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:20,960
Everything was still and quiet.

2431
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,840
Then I heard the sound of voices.

2432
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,680
The door of the dining-room was open.

2433
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:27,280
The guests were coming out of dinner.

2434
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:28,800
Someone laughed.

2435
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I walked slowly down the stairs to meet them.

2436
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,560
I remember very little of the first party
at Manderley.

2437
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:39,840
It was the first and the last we ever held
there.

2438
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:43,520
I remember that Frank tried to make me drink
a little champagne.

2439
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,080
I remember Beatrice smiling at me.

2440
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:48,400
I remember dancing with Giles.

2441
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:51,840
The band played and people danced.

2442
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:54,320
I stood there smiling at everyone.

2443
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:55,600
Maxim stood beside me.

2444
02:00:56,720 --> 02:01:01,040
His eyes were cold and hard, not the eyes
of the man I knew and loved.

2445
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:04,800
All through that long night, Maxim never looked
at me.

2446
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:09,440
Once, Beatrice came up to me and said, 'Why
don't you sit down?

2447
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:10,480
You look like death.'

2448
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:12,960
What was the time?

2449
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:13,760
I did not know.

2450
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:16,720
The night passed, hour after hour.

2451
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:22,080
Then at last Giles came up to me and said,
'Come and look at the fireworks on the terrace.'

2452
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:26,080
I remember standing on the terrace and staring
up at the sky.

2453
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:30,480
The fireworks rose into the sky and turned
into stars and flowers.

2454
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:32,560
The sky was red and gold.

2455
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:36,080
Every window of the house was coloured by
the falling lights.

2456
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:39,520
The grey walls of Manderley looked heavy and
dark.

2457
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,560
Then suddenly, the sky was dark too.

2458
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:44,480
The fireworks were over.

2459
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:47,520
I heard the sound of cars starting in the
drive.

2460
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:49,840
'They're beginning to go,' I thought.

2461
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:51,920
'Thank God, they're beginning to go.'

2462
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:55,040
People came up to me to say goodbye.

2463
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:58,320
'Such a wonderful party,' they said.

2464
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:00,480
'Thank you so much for a wonderful evening.

2465
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:02,880
The best party I've been to for a long time.'

2466
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,360
I shook hands with them all.

2467
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,080
I smiled.

2468
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:10,000
'I'm so glad, so glad,' I said.

2469
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:12,320
I could think of no other words.

2470
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:16,000
Maxim had gone with Frank to stand in the
drive.

2471
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:17,840
Beatrice Came up to me.

2472
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:20,880
'Well done, my dear,' she said.

2473
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:22,320
'The Ball was a great success.

2474
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:25,440
No one had any idea about... you know.

2475
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:27,520
You must go to bed now.

2476
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:28,560
You look very tired.

2477
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:30,320
Have your breakfast in bed.'

2478
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:31,940
'Yes.

2479
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:34,640
Yes, perhaps I shall,' I said.

2480
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:37,520
'I'll tell Maxim you've gone up to bed, shall
I?'

2481
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:39,440
'Yes, please, Beatrice.'

2482
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:41,680
'All right, my dear.

2483
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:42,240
Sleep well.'

2484
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:45,840
I walked slowly into the house.

2485
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:47,920
The lights had been turned off.

2486
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:48,960
The rooms were empty.

2487
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:52,480
I went up the stairs and along the corridor
to my room.

2488
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:56,240
It was almost light now and a bird had started
to sing.

2489
02:02:57,280 --> 02:03:00,240
I undressed slowly and got into bed.

2490
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:02,080
I lay back and closed my eyes.

2491
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:05,920
My body was tired, but my mind would not rest.

2492
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,560
I wondered how long Maxim would be.

2493
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:11,920
The little clock by my bed ticked away the
minutes.

2494
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:14,560
I lay on my side, watching it.

2495
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:16,960
An hour went by.

2496
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:27,840
But Maxim did not come.

2497
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:29,440
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

2498
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:31,280
'Why Don't You Jump?'

2499
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,840
I fell asleep at about seven o'clock.

2500
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:38,640
When I woke up again, it was after eleven.

2501
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:40,880
Clarice had brought me some tea.

2502
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:43,280
It was cold now, but I drank it.

2503
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:45,680
Maxim's bed was empty.

2504
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:47,840
He had not come to bed at all.

2505
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:51,200
I sat up, looking straight in front of me.

2506
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:54,000
My marriage was a failure.

2507
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:56,400
It had failed after only three months.

2508
02:03:57,600 --> 02:04:01,040
I was too young for Maxim, I knew too little
about the world.

2509
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,680
The fact that I loved him made no difference.

2510
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,000
It was not the sort of love he needed.

2511
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:08,400
Maxim was not in love with me.

2512
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:09,840
He had never loved me.

2513
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:13,120
He did not belong to me, he belonged to Rebecca.

2514
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:15,680
Rebecca was the real Mrs de Winter.

2515
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:19,680
I could never be the mistress of Manderley.

2516
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:24,240
Wherever I walked, wherever I sat, I saw Rebecca.

2517
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:25,120
I knew her well.

2518
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:30,240
I knew her tall, slim figure, her small face
and clear white skin.

2519
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:33,280
If I ever heard her voice, I would know it.

2520
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:36,880
Rebecca - always Rebecca.

2521
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:39,440
I would never escape from Rebecca.

2522
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:41,440
She was too strong for me.

2523
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:45,520
I got out of bed and opened the curtains.

2524
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:47,600
Sunlight filled the room.

2525
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:50,560
I could not hide in my bedroom any longer.

2526
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:53,680
I had a bath, dressed and went downstairs.

2527
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:56,240
The servants had been very busy.

2528
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:58,720
The rooms were clean and tidy.

2529
02:04:58,720 --> 02:04:59,680
The flowers had gone.

2530
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:03,360
Soon there would be nothing to remind us of
the Fancy Dress Ball.

2531
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,080
I met Robert in the dining-room.

2532
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:09,280
'Good morning, Robert,' I said.

2533
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:11,760
'Have you seen Mr de Winter anywhere?'

2534
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:15,520
'He went out soon after breakfast, Madam.

2535
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:16,640
He has not been in since.'

2536
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:21,440
I went into the small room behind the library
and picked up the telephone.

2537
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:23,840
Perhaps Maxim was with Frank.

2538
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:26,640
I had to talk to Maxim.

2539
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:28,480
I had to explain about last night.

2540
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:32,640
'Frank, it's me,' I said when he answered.

2541
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:33,840
'Where's Maxim?'

2542
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:36,320
'I don't know.

2543
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:38,080
I haven't seen him,' Frank said.

2544
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:39,760
'How did he sleep?

2545
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:41,760
How was he at breakfast?'

2546
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:47,840
'Frank,' I said slowly, 'Maxim did not come
to bed last night.'

2547
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:49,200
There was silence.

2548
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:54,240
'I was afraid something like that would happen,'
Frank said at last.

2549
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:57,040
'Where do you think he's gone?'

2550
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:57,540
I asked.

2551
02:05:58,240 --> 02:05:59,440
'I must see him.

2552
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:02,320
I've got to explain about last night.

2553
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:04,160
Maxim thinks I did it as a joke.'

2554
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:07,040
I could not stop my tears now.

2555
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:09,440
They poured down my face as I spoke.

2556
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:13,040
'You mustn't talk like that,' Frank said.

2557
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:14,960
'Let me come up and see you.'

2558
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:16,720
'No,' I said.

2559
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:18,160
'It has happened.

2560
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:20,080
Nothing can be changed now.

2561
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:22,400
Perhaps that's a good thing.

2562
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:24,880
I understand things more clearly now.'

2563
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:27,920
'What do you mean?' said Frank, quickly.

2564
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:32,160
'Maxim doesn't love me, he loves Rebecca,'
I said.

2565
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:34,080
'He's never forgotten her.

2566
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:36,720
He's never loved me, Frank.

2567
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:39,280
It's always Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca.'

2568
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,000
I heard Frank cry out.

2569
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:44,720
'I've got to come and see you,' he said.

2570
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:47,760
I put down the telephone stood up.

2571
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,160
I did not want to see Frank.

2572
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:51,200
He could not help me.

2573
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,440
No one could help me, but myself.

2574
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,720
Perhaps I would never see Maxim again.

2575
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:59,920
Perhaps Maxim had left me and would never
come back.

2576
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:02,960
I could not get these thoughts out of my mind.

2577
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:06,000
I went to the window and looked out.

2578
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:08,160
A fog had come up from the sea.

2579
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:10,160
I could not see the woods.

2580
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:13,600
It was very hot, but the sun was hidden behind
the wall of fog.

2581
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:16,960
I could hear the sea and I could smell it
in the fog.

2582
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:20,160
I walked out of the house and on to the lawn.

2583
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:22,240
I looked back at the house.

2584
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:25,840
One of the shutters in the west wing had been
pulled back.

2585
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:28,400
Someone was standing there, looking down at
me.

2586
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:31,520
For a moment, I thought that it was Maxim.

2587
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:36,000
Then the figure moved and I saw that it was
Mrs Danvers.

2588
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:39,920
I felt that she knew about my tears.

2589
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:41,600
She had planned all this to happen.

2590
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:45,600
This was her triumph - hers and Rebecca's.

2591
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:49,520
I remembered Mrs Danvers smiling at me, like
a devil.

2592
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:52,320
But she was a living woman like myself.

2593
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:54,640
She was not dead, like Rebecca.

2594
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:59,200
I could not speak to Rebecca, but I could
speak to Mrs Danvers.

2595
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:01,760
I walked back across the lawn.

2596
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:06,480
I went through the house, along the dark silent
corridor of the west wing to Rebecca's room.

2597
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:09,440
I turned the handle of the door and went inside.

2598
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,880
Mrs Danvers was still standing by the window.

2599
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:14,640
The shutter was folded back.

2600
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:18,800
She turned to me and I saw that her eyes were
red with crying.

2601
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:21,840
There were dark shadows on her white face.

2602
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:25,920
'You've done what you wanted, Mrs Danvers,'
I said.

2603
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:28,160
'You wanted this to happen, didn't you?

2604
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:29,840
Are you pleased now?

2605
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:31,200
Are you happy?'

2606
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:33,760
She turned her head away from me.

2607
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:37,520
'Why did you ever come to Manderley?'

2608
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:38,020
she said.

2609
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:40,080
'Nobody wanted you.

2610
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:41,760
We were all right until you came.'

2611
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:45,920
'You seem to forget that I love Mr de Winter,'
I said.

2612
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:50,320
'If you loved him, you would never have married
him,' Mrs Danvers said.

2613
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:52,880
'Why do you hate me?'

2614
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:53,520
I asked.

2615
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:55,200
'What have I done to you?'

2616
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:59,680
'You tried to take Mrs de Winter's place,'
she said.

2617
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,400
'But I changed nothing here.

2618
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:03,840
I left everything to you.

2619
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,480
I wanted to be friends with you,' I said.

2620
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:08,400
She did not answer.

2621
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:11,760
'Many people marry twice,' I said.

2622
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:14,560
'My marriage to Mr de Winter isn't a crime.

2623
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:18,240
Haven't we a right to be happy?'

2624
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:22,880
'Mr de Winter is not happy,' Mrs Danvers said,
looking at me at last.

2625
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:25,040
'Look into his eyes.

2626
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:26,560
He's in hell.

2627
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:29,360
He has looked like that ever since she died.'

2628
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:32,080
'It's not true,' I said.

2629
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:33,360
'It's not true.

2630
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:35,440
He was happy when we were in Italy together.'

2631
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:38,000
'Well, he's a man, isn't he?'

2632
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,280
she said with a hard laugh.

2633
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:42,400
'Every man likes to enjoy his honeymoon.'

2634
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:47,600
I was suddenly very angry and not afraid of
Mrs Danvers any more.

2635
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:50,160
I went up to her and shook her by the arm.

2636
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:53,120
'How dare you speak to me like that?

2637
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:53,920
How dare you?

2638
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:56,560
You made me wear that dress last night.

2639
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:58,720
You wanted to hurt Mr de Winter.

2640
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:01,520
Do you think his pain and unhappiness will
bring Mrs de Winter back?'

2641
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:04,240
Mrs Danvers moved away from me.

2642
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,600
'What do I care for his pain?'

2643
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:08,240
she said.

2644
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:09,840
'He's never cared about mine.

2645
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:15,280
How do you think I've felt, watching you sit
in her place, using the things she used?

2646
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:18,800
I hear the servants calling you Mrs de Winter.

2647
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:23,920
And all the time, the real Mrs de Winter,
with her smile and her lovely face is lying

2648
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:25,360
cold and dead in the church.'

2649
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:28,720
Mrs Danvers' face was twisted with pain.

2650
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:30,240
Her voice was loud and hard.

2651
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:36,560
'Mr de Winter deserves his pain, marrying
a young girl like you - and only ten months

2652
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:37,120
afterwards.

2653
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:39,200
Well, he's paying for it now.

2654
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:42,320
He knows she is watching him.

2655
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:44,640
My lady comes at night and watches him.

2656
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:47,600
'I looked after her when she was a child.

2657
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:48,320
Did you know that?'

2658
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:50,720
'No,' I said, 'no.

2659
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:53,040
What's the use of this, Mrs Danvers?

2660
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:54,480
I don't want to hear any more.'

2661
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:57,360
Mrs Danvers did not seem to hear me.

2662
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,400
She went on speaking in a high, harsh voice.

2663
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:04,640
'Mrs de Winter was a lovely child,' she said.

2664
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:09,200
'When she was only twelve years old, the men
could not stop looking at her.

2665
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:11,760
But even then, she cared for nothing and nobody.

2666
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:14,000
And that's how she was when she grew up.

2667
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:16,080
She was beaten in the end.

2668
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:17,440
But it wasn't a man.

2669
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:18,320
It wasn't a woman.

2670
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:20,080
The sea got her.

2671
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:23,840
The sea was too strong for her in the end.'

2672
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:28,960
Mrs Danvers began to cry noisily, with her
mouth open and her eyes dry.

2673
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:32,080
'Mrs Danvers, you're not well.

2674
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:33,680
You ought to be in bed,' I said.

2675
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:35,520
She looked at me angrily.

2676
02:11:36,160 --> 02:11:36,960
'Leave me alone.

2677
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:38,880
Why shouldn't I cry?

2678
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:40,560
What's it to do with you?

2679
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:44,320
You came here and thought you could take Mrs
de Winter's place.

2680
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:44,820
You!

2681
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:49,120
Why, even the servants laughed at you when
you came to Manderley.'

2682
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:52,240
'You'd better stop this, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

2683
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:53,520
'You'd better go to your room.'

2684
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:55,140
'Yes.

2685
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:57,280
And then what will you do?

2686
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:02,000
You'll go to Mr de Winter and tell him that
Mrs Danvers has been unkind to you.

2687
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:05,840
You'll go to him like you did when Mr Favell
came here.

2688
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:09,760
'Mr de Winter was jealous of Mr Favell when
she was alive.

2689
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:10,880
He's jealous now.

2690
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:13,920
That shows you he's not forgotten her, doesn't
it?

2691
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,560
Of course Mr de Winter was jealous.

2692
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:17,840
She didn't care.

2693
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:18,880
She only laughed.

2694
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:24,560
All the men fell in love with her, Mr de Winter,
Mr Favell, Mr Crawley.

2695
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:25,920
It was like a game to her.'

2696
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:28,480
'I don't want to know,' I said.

2697
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:29,360
'I don't want to know.'

2698
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:33,840
Mrs Danvers came close to me and put her face
near to mine.

2699
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:36,720
'It's no use, is it?'

2700
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:37,220
she said.

2701
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:40,640
'She's the real Mrs de Winter, not you.'

2702
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:44,000
I backed away from her, towards the window.

2703
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:48,000
She took my hand and held it.

2704
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,320
'Why don't you go?' she said again.

2705
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:53,600
'He doesn't want you, he never did.

2706
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:55,760
He can't forget her.

2707
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:59,120
He wants to be alone in the house again, with
her.'

2708
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:02,320
She pushed me towards the open window.

2709
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:04,320
I could see the stones of the terrace below.

2710
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:07,040
Beyond the terrace was a white wall of fog.

2711
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:11,200
'Look down there,' Mrs Danvers said.

2712
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:13,200
'It's easy, isn't it?

2713
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:15,840
Why don't you jump?

2714
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:17,280
It wouldn't hurt.

2715
02:13:18,160 --> 02:13:19,520
It's not like drowning.

2716
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:21,680
Why don't you try it?

2717
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:24,240
Why don't you go?'

2718
02:13:26,160 --> 02:13:28,880
The fog came in through the open window, damp
and thick.

2719
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:31,760
I held on to the window ledge with both hands.

2720
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:35,200
'Don't be afraid,' said Mrs Danvers.

2721
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:36,640
'I won't push you.

2722
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:38,480
You can jump.

2723
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:41,440
You're not happy.

2724
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:43,840
Mr de Winter doesn't love you.

2725
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:46,240
Why don't you jump now?'

2726
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:49,840
The fog was thicker than before.

2727
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:52,160
There was fog below and all around me.

2728
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:55,840
If I jumped now, I would not see the stones.

2729
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:57,840
The fall would kill me.

2730
02:13:58,560 --> 02:13:59,840
Maxim did not love me.

2731
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:03,840
'Go on,' whispered Mrs Danvers.

2732
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:07,760
'Go on, don't be afraid.'

2733
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:10,240
I shut my eyes.

2734
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:12,960
My fingers ached from holding the ledge.

2735
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:16,080
The thick fog made me forget my unhappiness.

2736
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:19,040
I could forget about loving Maxim.

2737
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:21,040
I could forget about Rebecca.

2738
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:25,920
I would not have to think about Rebecca any
more...

2739
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:28,160
A loud explosion shook the window where we
stood.

2740
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:29,840
The glass cracked.

2741
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:32,960
I opened my eyes and stared at Mrs Danvers.

2742
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:37,360
The first explosion was followed by another,
then a third and a fourth.

2743
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:38,880
'What is it?'

2744
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:40,020
I said.

2745
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:41,120
'What has happened?'

2746
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:44,080
Mrs Danvers let go my arm.

2747
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:46,560
She stared out of the window into the fog.

2748
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:49,600
'It's the rockets,' she said.

2749
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:52,080
'There must be a ship in trouble in the bay.'

2750
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:56,720
We listened, staring into the white fog together.

2751
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:07,840
And then we heard the sound of footsteps on
the terrace below us.

2752
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:17,920
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

2753
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:22,320
Rebecca Has Won

2754
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,080
It was Maxim down on the terrace.

2755
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:26,800
I could not see him, but I could hear his
voice.

2756
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:29,280
I heard Frith answer from the hall.

2757
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:33,440
'A ship's hit the rocks in the bay,' Maxim
called out.

2758
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,080
'The fog is terrible out there.

2759
02:15:36,080 --> 02:15:38,720
Tell Mrs Danvers to have food and drink ready
for the men.

2760
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:41,440
I'm going back to the bay to see if I can
do anything.'

2761
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:44,640
Mrs Danvers moved back from the window.

2762
02:15:46,240 --> 02:15:50,000
'We had better go down,' she said in her usual
voice.

2763
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,280
'Frith will be looking for me.

2764
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:53,920
Be careful of your hands.

2765
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:55,120
I am going to close the window.'

2766
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:58,800
Then she went to the door and held it open
for me.

2767
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:04,320
'When you see Mr de Winter, Madam, please
tell him there will be a hot meal ready for

2768
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:05,280
the men at any time.'

2769
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:07,600
I stared at her.

2770
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:10,000
'Yes,' I said.

2771
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:12,240
'Yes, Mrs Danvers.'

2772
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,400
She turned her back on me and went along the
corridor.

2773
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:18,720
I walked slowly out of the room.

2774
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,880
I felt as though I had just woken up from
a long sleep.

2775
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:25,760
When I reached the hall, I saw Frith.

2776
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:29,520
'Did you hear the rockets, Madam?' he said.

2777
02:16:30,080 --> 02:16:32,080
'Mr de Winter's gone down to the bay.

2778
02:16:32,640 --> 02:16:35,120
He went across the lawn only a few minutes
ago.'

2779
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:37,920
I went out on to the terrace.

2780
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:41,201
The fog was beginning to clear and I could
see the woods again.

2781
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:44,080
I looked up at the window above my head.

2782
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:46,000
It looked very high.

2783
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,359
I suddenly felt very hot.

2784
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:50,320
My head ached and my hands were wet.

2785
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:52,399
I stood very still.

2786
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:56,720
Then for the first time I realized that Maxim
had not gone away.

2787
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,040
I had heard his voice and he was down there
in the bay.

2788
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:02,960
Maxim was safe.

2789
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:06,080
Nothing else mattered if Maxim was safe.

2790
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:09,439
I began to walk along the path through the
woods.

2791
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:11,519
The fog had almost gone now.

2792
02:17:12,399 --> 02:17:14,639
When I came to the bay, I could see the ship
at once.

2793
02:17:15,359 --> 02:17:17,679
She was on the rocks about two miles from
the shore.

2794
02:17:18,399 --> 02:17:20,000
There were some small boats near her.

2795
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:23,359
I climbed up the path to the cliffs above
the bay.

2796
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:27,840
Frank was there talking to a coast-guard,
but I could not see Maxim.

2797
02:17:28,479 --> 02:17:32,719
'They're going to send a diver down soon,
Mrs de Winter,' said the coastguard.

2798
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:35,040
'They want to see if they can get the ship
off the rocks.'

2799
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:37,439
'Have you seen Maxim?'

2800
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:38,240
I asked Frank.

2801
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:42,240
'He's taken one of the sailors to hospital,'
Frank told me.

2802
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:43,840
'The man was hurt.

2803
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:46,880
Maxim is always a great help at times like
this.

2804
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:49,200
What are you going to do?

2805
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:50,880
Can I walk back with you to the house?'

2806
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:53,040
'I think I'll stay here.

2807
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:55,840
I want to see the diver go down,' I said.

2808
02:17:56,640 --> 02:17:58,161
'Very well,' Frank said.

2809
02:17:58,720 --> 02:18:00,320
'I shall be at the office if you want me.'

2810
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:03,041
The coastguard looked at his watch.

2811
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,560
'Well, I must be getting along too,' he said.

2812
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:07,360
'Good afternoon.'

2813
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:10,800
The sea was calm now.

2814
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:12,480
The diver went down and came up again.

2815
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:14,000
Nothing else happened.

2816
02:18:14,720 --> 02:18:15,600
It was very hot.

2817
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:19,840
I sat on the cliffs for a long time doing
nothing, thinking of nothing.

2818
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:23,920
When I looked at my watch again, it was three
o'clock.

2819
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:26,080
I got up and walked down the hill to the bay.

2820
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:28,960
When I came to the other side, I saw Ben.

2821
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:31,120
He stood there, smiling at me.

2822
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:34,720
'Seen the big ship?' he said.

2823
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:36,560
'Yes,' I said.

2824
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:38,639
'She's on the rocks, isn't she?'

2825
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:41,760
'She'll break up,' he said.

2826
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:45,281
'The big ship won't go down like the little
one.

2827
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:47,840
She won't come back, will she?'

2828
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:49,220
'Who?'

2829
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:50,161
I asked him.

2830
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:52,319
'Her,' he said.

2831
02:18:52,960 --> 02:18:53,840
'The other one.'

2832
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:56,639
I did not know what Ben meant.

2833
02:18:57,439 --> 02:18:59,839
I left him and walked towards the path through
the woods.

2834
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:02,479
I did not look at the cottage.

2835
02:19:02,479 --> 02:19:05,839
As I went up the path, a strange fear began
to fill my heart.

2836
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:08,080
The house looked very peaceful.

2837
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:12,720
Manderley was a place of safety and looked
more beautiful than I had ever seen it.

2838
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:16,720
I felt, for the first time, that it was my
home.

2839
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:20,880
I belonged to Manderley and Manderley belonged
to me.

2840
02:19:22,399 --> 02:19:24,399
I went through the house and into the library.

2841
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:26,399
Jasper was not there.

2842
02:19:26,399 --> 02:19:27,839
He must have gone out with Maxim.

2843
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:32,080
I suddenly felt very hungry, and so I asked
Robert to bring in the tea.

2844
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:35,920
I still had a strange feeling of fear in my
heart.

2845
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:38,080
I felt that I was waiting for  

2846
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:40,240
something - something
terrible.

2847
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:44,560
As I sat drinking my tea, Robert came back
into the room.

2848
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,840
'Captain Searle, the harbour-master, is on
the phone, Madam,' he told me.

2849
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:52,720
'He wants to come here and speak to Mr de
Winter at once.

2850
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:54,160
He says it's very important.'

2851
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:58,161
'Mr de Winter is not back yet, Robert,' I
told him.

2852
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:01,920
'Ask Captain Searle to come up and wait.'

2853
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,600
Robert went out of the room with the message.

2854
02:20:04,399 --> 02:20:06,319
I wondered what Captain Searle wanted to say.

2855
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:09,120
It must be something to do with the ship out
in the bay.

2856
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:11,360
But why did he want to see Maxim?

2857
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:16,160
Captain Searle came into the library about
fifteen minutes later.

2858
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:18,560
He looked at me with his bright blue eyes.

2859
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:22,720
'I'm afraid I've got some bad news for Mr
de Winter.

2860
02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:24,559
I don't know how to tell him.'

2861
02:20:25,439 --> 02:20:27,439
'What sort of news, Captain Searle?'

2862
02:20:27,439 --> 02:20:28,000
I asked him.

2863
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:31,599
'Well, Mrs de Winter, it's not very pleasant.

2864
02:20:32,479 --> 02:20:36,559
When we sent the diver down to look at the
ship, he found something else.

2865
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:38,960
It was a little sailing boat.

2866
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:43,840
It's the boat that belonged to the late Mrs
de Winter.'

2867
02:20:44,479 --> 02:20:45,759
'I'm sorry,' I said.

2868
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,080
'Must you tell Mr de Winter?

2869
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:50,000
Can't the boat be left there?'

2870
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:54,800
'The man found something else,' Captain Searle
answered slowly.

2871
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:59,281
'The cabin door was closed, so he broke a
window and looked in.

2872
02:21:00,399 --> 02:21:01,759
Then he got a terrible fright.

2873
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:05,120
There was a body in there on the cabin floor.

2874
02:21:06,399 --> 02:21:08,559
I must tell your husband, Mrs de Winter.

2875
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:11,840
The police will have to know too.'

2876
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:15,040
This was the reason for the strange fear in
my heart.

2877
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,319
Someone had been in the boat with Rebecca
that night.

2878
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:20,880
'Do we have to tell him?'

2879
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:21,380
I asked.

2880
02:21:22,399 --> 02:21:26,240
'I've got to do my duty,' Captain Searle said.

2881
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:26,800
He stopped.

2882
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:28,720
The door had opened.

2883
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:29,600
It was Maxim.

2884
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:31,680
'Hello,' he said.

2885
02:21:32,399 --> 02:21:34,000
'Is something the matter, Captain Searle?'

2886
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:36,560
I felt very afraid.

2887
02:21:37,359 --> 02:21:39,839
I went out of the room quickly and shut the
door behind me.

2888
02:21:40,479 --> 02:21:43,120
Jasper was in the hall and he walked out on
to the terrace with me.

2889
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:44,480
I sat down.

2890
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:47,121
I must not fail Maxim now.

2891
02:21:48,319 --> 02:21:51,599
I sat on the terrace until I heard Captain
Searle's car drive away.

2892
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:54,559
Then I stood up and walked slowly back to
the library.

2893
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:57,201
Maxim was standing by the window.

2894
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,439
I went and stood beside him.

2895
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:02,559
I took his hand and held it against my face.

2896
02:22:04,399 --> 02:22:06,639
'I want to help you, Maxim,' I said.

2897
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:08,720
'I've grown up, you know.

2898
02:22:09,439 --> 02:22:10,799
I'm not a child any more.'

2899
02:22:12,319 --> 02:22:14,799
Maxim put his arm round me and held me closely.

2900
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:19,120
'I was angry with you last night, wasn't I?'
he said.

2901
02:22:20,479 --> 02:22:24,080
'Maxim,' I asked him, 'can't we start again?'

2902
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:28,800
'It's too late, my darling, too late,' he
said.

2903
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:31,201
'We've lost our chance of happiness.

2904
02:22:32,319 --> 02:22:33,200
Something has happened.

2905
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,319
Something I've dreamt about, night after night.

2906
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:38,720
I knew we could never be happy.'

2907
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:42,880
Maxim held both my hands and looked into my
face.

2908
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:46,080
'Rebecca has won,' he said.

2909
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:48,160
I stared at him.

2910
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:50,320
My heart began to beat fast.

2911
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:52,560
What was Maxim trying to tell me?

2912
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:56,160
'I always knew this would happen,' Maxim said.

2913
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:59,200
'Rebecca has kept us apart all this time.

2914
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:02,080
I remember how she looked at me before she
died.

2915
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:03,840
I remember her smile.

2916
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,000
She knew this would happen.

2917
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:08,160
She knew she would win in the end.'

2918
02:23:09,359 --> 02:23:11,599
'Maxim,' I whispered.

2919
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:12,720
'What are you trying to tell me?

2920
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:15,840
Captain Searle told me about the boat.

2921
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:18,240
There was someone sailing with Rebecca.

2922
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:19,920
You have to find out who it was.

2923
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:21,840
That's it, isn't it, Maxim?'

2924
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:25,600
'No,' he said, 'you don't understand.

2925
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:28,320
There was no one with Rebecca.

2926
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:32,000
She was alone.'

2927
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,960
I stood there watching his face, watching
his eyes.

2928
02:23:36,160 --> 02:23:38,960
'It's Rebecca's body lying there on the cabin
floor.'

2929
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:41,599
'No,' I said.

2930
02:23:41,600 --> 02:23:42,100
'No!'

2931
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:45,839
'The woman buried in the church is not Rebecca.

2932
02:23:46,479 --> 02:23:48,639
I always knew that,' Maxim said.

2933
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:50,800
'Rebecca was not drowned.

2934
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:52,480
I killed her.

2935
02:23:53,359 --> 02:23:55,200
I shot Rebecca in the cottage.

2936
02:23:56,080 --> 02:24:00,399
I carried her body to the cabin, took the
boat out that night and sank it.

2937
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:03,680
It's Rebecca who's lying there on the cabin
floor.

2938
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:13,840
Will you look into my eyes and tell me that
you love me now?'

2939
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:24,880
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

2940
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:27,840
The Truth About Rebecca

2941
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:30,480
It was very quiet in the library.

2942
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:33,840
When people have a great shock, they feel
nothing at first.

2943
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:37,600
I stood beside Maxim and I had no feelings
at all.

2944
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:41,840
Then Maxim took me in his arms and began to
kiss me.

2945
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:43,920
I shut my eyes.

2946
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:46,480
He had never kissed me like this before.

2947
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:50,000
'I love you so much,' he whispered.

2948
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:53,920
This is what I had wanted him to say, every
day and every night.

2949
02:24:54,640 --> 02:24:56,161
But I could feel nothing now.

2950
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:59,920
Maxim stopped suddenly and pushed me away
from him.

2951
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:02,880
'You see, I was right,' he said.

2952
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:04,640
'It's too late.

2953
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:05,600
You don't love me now.'

2954
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:09,840
'It's not too late,' I said, putting my arms
round him.

2955
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:12,319
'I love you more than anything in the world.'

2956
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:15,920
'It's no use now,' said Maxim.

2957
02:25:16,479 --> 02:25:17,439
'We have no time.

2958
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:19,679
They've found the boat.

2959
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:20,640
They've found Rebecca.'

2960
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:24,880
I stared at him, not understanding.

2961
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:26,640
'What will they do?'

2962
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:27,780
I said.

2963
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:31,519
'They will make sure that the body in the
cabin is Rebecca.

2964
02:25:32,399 --> 02:25:34,879
Then they will remember that other body in
the church.

2965
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:38,640
The other woman - the one I said was Rebecca.'

2966
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:40,960
'What are we going to do?'

2967
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:42,100
I said.

2968
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:44,240
Maxim did not answer.

2969
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:47,120
'Does anyone know?

2970
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:48,319
Anyone at all?'

2971
02:25:48,319 --> 02:25:48,819
I said.

2972
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:51,920
Maxim shook his head.

2973
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:53,280
'Are you sure Frank doesn't know?'

2974
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:54,640
I asked quickly.

2975
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:57,440
'How could he?' said Maxim.

2976
02:25:58,560 --> 02:25:59,840
'There was nobody there but me.

2977
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:01,360
It was dark...'

2978
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:03,360
He stopped.

2979
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:06,480
He sat down on a chair and I went and knelt
beside him.

2980
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:09,120
'Why didn't you tell me?'

2981
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:10,400
I whispered.

2982
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:14,080
'I nearly did, once,' Maxim said.

2983
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:17,359
'But you always seemed so unhappy and so shy.'

2984
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:20,399
I answered very quietly.

2985
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:24,000
'I knew you were thinking about Rebecca all
the time.

2986
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:28,080
How could I ask you to love me when I knew
you loved Rebecca?'

2987
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:31,760
'You thought I loved Rebecca?'

2988
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:32,260
he said.

2989
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,160
'I hated her.

2990
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:36,960
We never loved each other.

2991
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:39,040
Rebecca never loved anyone except herself.'

2992
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:42,640
I sat on the floor, staring at him.

2993
02:26:43,359 --> 02:26:46,240
'She was clever of course,' Maxim went on.

2994
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:49,040
'Everyone thought she was the kindest, the
most charming person.

2995
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:52,880
When I married her, people told me I was the
luckiest man in the world.'

2996
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:56,480
'I found out the truth five days after we
were married.

2997
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:58,880
We were in the hills near Monte Carlo.

2998
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:01,200
It was the same place I went to with you.

2999
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:01,840
Do you remember?

3000
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:06,560
She sat there in the car and told me terrible,
evil things about herself.

3001
02:27:07,359 --> 02:27:08,880
Things that I could not tell anyone.'

3002
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,520
Maxim stared out of the window.

3003
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:14,640
'I did not kill her then,' he said.

3004
02:27:15,359 --> 02:27:16,240
'I let her laugh.

3005
02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:19,679
She knew that I would take her to Manderley.

3006
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:21,201
She knew I would never divorce her.

3007
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:24,640
I would never tell people all the terrible
things she had told me.'

3008
02:27:26,399 --> 02:27:28,399
Maxim came up to me and held out his hands.

3009
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:31,920
'You hate me, don't you?' he said.

3010
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:34,241
'You can't understand me, can you?'

3011
02:27:36,080 --> 02:27:37,280
I did not say anything.

3012
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,680
I held his hands against my heart.

3013
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:41,760
Only one thing mattered.

3014
02:27:42,479 --> 02:27:44,399
Maxim did not love Rebecca.

3015
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:48,399
He had never loved her, never, never.

3016
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:51,040
Maxim was talking again.

3017
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:54,880
'I thought about Manderley too much,' he said.

3018
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:57,840
'I put Manderley first, before anything else.

3019
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:01,280
I can't tell you about those terrible years
with Rebecca.

3020
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:04,640
But she made Manderley the place of beauty
it is today.

3021
02:28:05,439 --> 02:28:07,679
And I accepted everything, because of Manderley.

3022
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:11,840
'Rebecca was careful at first,' Maxim went
on.

3023
02:28:12,399 --> 02:28:13,759
'She had a flat in London.

3024
02:28:13,760 --> 02:28:14,880
She met her friends there.

3025
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,439
Then she began to grow careless.

3026
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,319
She invited friends down here, to Manderley.

3027
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:21,760
I warned her.

3028
02:28:22,399 --> 02:28:24,000
I told her that Manderley was mine.

3029
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:26,560
Rebecca did not say anything.

3030
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:27,520
She only smiled.

3031
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:31,201
'Then Frank came to me and told me he wanted
to leave.

3032
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,359
He wouldn't say why at first.

3033
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:35,840
But I got the truth from him in the end.

3034
02:28:36,880 --> 02:28:38,560
Rebecca never left him alone.

3035
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:42,319
She was always going to his house and asking
him to her cottage.

3036
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:45,201
'Rebecca went up to London for a time.

3037
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,880
When she came back, she took Giles out sailing
with her.

3038
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:51,840
I knew what had happened as soon as they came
back.

3039
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:55,040
Beatrice and Giles never stayed at Manderley
again.

3040
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:59,600
After that, I knew I could never trust Rebecca
with anyone.

3041
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:03,600
'She had a cousin, an awful man, called Jack
Favell.

3042
02:29:04,399 --> 02:29:06,080
He started to come here when I was away.'

3043
02:29:06,880 --> 02:29:08,800
'I've met him,' I said.

3044
02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:10,320
'He came here the day you went to London.

3045
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:12,399
I didn't tell you.

3046
02:29:12,399 --> 02:29:14,000
I didn't want to remind you of Rebecca.'

3047
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:17,200
'Remind me?' said Maxim.

3048
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:19,280
'Oh God, I never needed to be reminded.

3049
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:22,880
'Favell often stayed with Rebecca down at
the cottage.

3050
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:24,640
He is a bad man.

3051
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:27,680
He's been in trouble with the police many
times.

3052
02:29:28,479 --> 02:29:31,679
I told Rebecca that I would shoot Favell if
he came to Manderley again.

3053
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:35,840
'Then, one night, I could stand our life here
no longer.

3054
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:38,560
Rebecca came back from London very late.

3055
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:40,240
She went to the cottage.

3056
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:42,319
I thought Favell was with her.

3057
02:29:42,880 --> 02:29:43,760
I went after them.

3058
02:29:44,399 --> 02:29:46,000
I took a gun to frighten him.'

3059
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:50,000
Maxim was talking in quick, short sentences.

3060
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,359
I held his hand tightly.

3061
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:54,320
'I saw a light in the cottage and went in.

3062
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:57,120
To my surprise, Rebecca was alone.

3063
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:58,479
She looked ill and strange.

3064
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:01,439
"This is the end," I told her.

3065
02:30:01,439 --> 02:30:02,559
"I can't stand any more."

3066
02:30:03,439 --> 02:30:05,120
Rebecca looked at me and smiled.

3067
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:08,240
"It won't be easy to divorce me," she said.

3068
02:30:08,240 --> 02:30:10,639
"Everyone believes our marriage is perfect."

3069
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:12,480
'Then she stood up and walked towards me.

3070
02:30:13,359 --> 02:30:17,839
"If I had a child, Max," she said, "Everyone
would think it was yours.

3071
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:19,680
You would like a son, wouldn't you?

3072
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:21,760
A boy to grow up at Manderley.

3073
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:24,000
And you would never know who his father was."

3074
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:26,800
'And she smiled at me again.

3075
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:28,560
She was smiling when I killed her.

3076
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:32,160
The bullet went through her heart.'

3077
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:33,599
Maxim's voice was very low.

3078
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:35,200
He spoke slowly.

3079
02:30:36,399 --> 02:30:38,000
'There was blood all over the floor.

3080
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:41,280
I had to get water from the sea to clean the
place.

3081
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:46,000
'There was no moon and it was very dark,'
Maxim went on.

3082
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:47,840
'I carried Rebecca's body to the boat.

3083
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:50,720
I laid the body on the floor of the cabin.

3084
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:53,440
Then I took the boat out into the bay.

3085
02:30:54,479 --> 02:30:58,000
I wanted to take the boat a good way out,
but the wind was too strong for me.

3086
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:02,000
'I made some holes in the wooden planks with
a metal spike.

3087
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:05,281
I opened the sea cocks and the sea water flowed
in.

3088
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:08,080
In a few minutes it had covered my feet.

3089
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:12,800
I shut the cabin door behind me, climbed into
the dinghy and rowed back.

3090
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:15,440
Rebecca's boat was already sinking.

3091
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:17,920
I sat and watched it go down.'

3092
02:31:19,359 --> 02:31:20,399
Maxim looked at me.

3093
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:23,040
'That's all,' he said.

3094
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:25,200
'There's no more to tell.'

3095
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:29,041
The library was very quiet.

3096
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:32,560
We sat there together for some minutes without
saying anything.

3097
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:35,120
Then Maxim began to speak again.

3098
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:39,360
'I knew the boat would be found one day,'
he said.

3099
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:41,840
'Rebecca knew she would win in the end.

3100
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:44,400
I saw her smile when she died.'

3101
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:47,920
'But Rebecca is dead,' I told him.

3102
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:49,840
'That's what we must remember.'

3103
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:52,880
'The diver has seen the body.

3104
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:55,840
They're going to get the boat up tomorrow
morning.

3105
02:31:56,720 --> 02:31:59,440
They'll find out that it's Rebecca's body
in the cabin.'

3106
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:03,200
'Then you must say you made a mistake about
the other body.

3107
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:04,479
Nobody saw you that night.

3108
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,920
We are the only two people who know what happened
that night, Maxim.'

3109
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:10,240
'Yes,' he said.

3110
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:12,080
'Yes, I suppose so.'

3111
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:15,840
'They will think the boat sank when Rebecca
went down into the cabin.

3112
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:18,000
They'll think she was trapped there.

3113
02:32:18,640 --> 02:32:20,640
They'll think that, won't they, Maxim?'

3114
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:21,140
I said.

3115
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:25,201
'I don't know,' Maxim replied slowly.

3116
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:27,281
'I don't know.'

3117
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:37,840
At that moment, the telephone in the next
room began to ring.

3118
02:32:42,080 --> 02:32:43,040
CHAPTER NINETEEN

3119
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:44,640
Colonel Julyan

3120
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:49,519
Maxim went into the little room and closed
the door.

3121
02:32:50,479 --> 02:32:53,040
I sat there, listening to the sound of Maxim's
voice.

3122
02:32:54,160 --> 02:32:58,000
I was no longer afraid of Rebecca; I did not
hate her any more.

3123
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:01,040
Maxim and I were going to fight this together.

3124
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:06,000
Rebecca had not won, she had lost.

3125
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:09,600
'That was Colonel Julyan,' said Maxim, as
he came back into the room.

3126
02:33:10,240 --> 02:33:11,519
He is the local magistrate.

3127
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:15,359
He has to be there when they get the boat
up tomorrow.

3128
02:33:15,359 --> 02:33:17,839
He asked me if I had made a mistake about
the other body.'

3129
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:20,640
The telephone began to ring again.

3130
02:33:21,359 --> 02:33:24,000
Maxim answered it quickly and came back into
the library.

3131
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:26,720
'It's begun,' he said.

3132
02:33:27,439 --> 02:33:29,040
'What do you mean?' asked.

3133
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:30,880
'That was a reporter.

3134
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:33,760
The whole thing will be in the papers tomorrow.

3135
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:34,800
There's nothing we can do.'

3136
02:33:36,399 --> 02:33:39,200
After dinner, we went back into the library
as usual.

3137
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:43,040
I sat at Maxim's feet, my head against his
knees.

3138
02:33:44,319 --> 02:33:47,840
In a strange way, we were completely happy.

3139
02:33:48,399 --> 02:33:49,519
Rain fell in the night.

3140
02:33:50,319 --> 02:33:52,799
When I woke up in the morning, Maxim had already
gone out.

3141
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:55,201
I went down to breakfast as usual.

3142
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:58,160
There were a lot of letters thanking us for
the Ball.

3143
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,479
How far away that seemed!

3144
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:03,679
I felt calmer, much older now.

3145
02:34:04,960 --> 02:34:06,560
I took the letters into the morning-room.

3146
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:10,000
To my surprise, the room was dusty and untidy.

3147
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:13,680
The windows were tightly closed and some of
the flowers were dead.

3148
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:18,480
I rang the bell for a maid and when she came,
I spoke to her angrily.

3149
02:34:19,439 --> 02:34:22,080
I wondered why I had been frightened of the
servants before.

3150
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:25,281
The menu for the day lay on the desk.

3151
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,840
It was the same food as the day before.

3152
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:30,480
I crossed everything out and rang for Robert.

3153
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:34,480
'Tell Mrs Danvers to order something different,'
I told him.

3154
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:37,920
Then I went out into the garden and cut some
roses.

3155
02:34:38,960 --> 02:34:40,800
Very soon Maxim will be back, I thought.

3156
02:34:41,439 --> 02:34:44,319
I must be calm and quiet.

3157
02:34:44,319 --> 02:34:46,160
I took the roses back into the morning-room.

3158
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:48,160
It was clean and tidy now.

3159
02:34:49,439 --> 02:34:52,160
As I began to arrange the flowers, there was
a knock at the door.

3160
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:55,680
It was Mrs Danvers, holding the menu in her
hand.

3161
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,840
She looked pale and tired.

3162
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:01,520
'I don't understand,' she said.

3163
02:35:02,479 --> 02:35:04,719
'I'm not used to having messages sent by Robert.

3164
02:35:05,359 --> 02:35:09,120
When Mrs de Winter wanted any change in the
menu, she spoke to me herself.'

3165
02:35:10,160 --> 02:35:13,280
'I am Mrs de Winter now, Mrs Danvers,' I said.

3166
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:15,120
'And I shall do things in my own way.'

3167
02:35:16,479 --> 02:35:17,839
Mrs Danvers stared at me.

3168
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:26,080
'Is it true,' she asked slowly, 'that Mrs
de Winter's boat has been found and that there

3169
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,359
was a body in the cabin?'

3170
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:31,120
'I am afraid I don't know anything about that,'
I said.

3171
02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:33,060
'Don't you?'

3172
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:34,800
Mrs Danvers said.

3173
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:36,880
She stood looking at me.

3174
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:38,241
I turned away.

3175
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:42,560
'I will give orders about the lunch,' she
said.

3176
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:45,760
She waited, but I did not say anything.

3177
02:35:46,399 --> 02:35:47,439
She went out of the room.

3178
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:50,640
Mrs Danvers did not frighten me any more.

3179
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:54,240
She was my enemy and I did not care.

3180
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:58,559
But if she learnt the truth about Rebecca's
death, she would become Maxim's enemy too.

3181
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:01,040
I suddenly felt sick and ill.

3182
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,479
I went out on to the terrace and began to
walk up and down.

3183
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:08,400
At half past eleven, Maxim phoned me from
Frank's office.

3184
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:11,920
He told me he was bringing Colonel Julyan
and Frank back for lunch.

3185
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:14,080
The time dragged by.

3186
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:17,520
At five to one, I heard the sound of a car
in the drive.

3187
02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:22,080
Maxim came into the hall with Frank and Colonel
Julyan.

3188
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:26,559
Colonel Julyan, the magistrate, was a middle-aged
man with a kind face and grey hair.

3189
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:31,760
'This is most unpleasant for you and your
husband,' Colonel Julyan said to me.

3190
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:34,000
'I feel very sorry for both of you.'

3191
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:39,840
Maxim and Frank went on into the dining-room
and Colonel Julyan continued to speak to me

3192
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:40,400
quietly.

3193
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:43,280
'We found a body in the boat this morning.

3194
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:46,000
It is the body of the late Mrs de Winter.

3195
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:51,360
As you know, Mr de Winter identified the other
body found in the sea as his wife.

3196
02:36:52,160 --> 02:36:54,479
That makes things rather difficult for us
now.'

3197
02:36:55,600 --> 02:36:58,320
The Colonel stopped suddenly as Maxim came
back into the hall.

3198
02:36:59,359 --> 02:37:01,920
'Lunch is ready; shall we go in?' he said.

3199
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:04,960
I did not look at Maxim during lunch.

3200
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:09,201
We talked about the weather and Colonel Julyan
asked me about my life in France.

3201
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:13,359
Frith and Robert were in the room and no one
wanted to talk about the boat.

3202
02:37:14,319 --> 02:37:17,840
At last Frith served coffee and the servants
left us.

3203
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:23,839
'I wish an inquest wasn't necessary,' Colonel
Julyan said, 'but I'm afraid it is.

3204
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:26,000
I don't think it will take very long.

3205
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:29,920
De Winter will have to say that the body in
the boat was the late Mrs de Winter.

3206
02:37:30,479 --> 02:37:34,240
Then the boat-builder will say that the boat
was in good order when he last saw it.

3207
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:35,760
This must be done.'

3208
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:39,359
'That's quite all right,' Maxim said.

3209
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:40,640
'We understand.'

3210
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:46,000
'I suppose Mrs de Winter had to go down into
the cabin for something.

3211
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:49,040
Then the door shut and, somehow, she was trapped
there.

3212
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:51,200
Don't you think so, Crawley?'

3213
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:52,240
the Colonel asked Frank.

3214
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:55,280
'Oh yes, of course,' said Frank.

3215
02:37:56,319 --> 02:37:58,399
I had a sudden feeling that Frank knew the
truth.

3216
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:03,920
'The inquest will be on Tuesday afternoon,'
Colonel Julyan told us.

3217
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:08,240
'We'll keep it as short as possible, but I'm
afraid the reporters will be there.'

3218
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:10,559
There was another silence.

3219
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:12,880
'Shall we go into the garden?'

3220
02:38:12,880 --> 02:38:13,840
I said.

3221
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:18,640
We all stood on the terrace for a moment and
then Colonel Julyan looked at his watch.

3222
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:21,440
'Thank you for the lunch,' he said to me.

3223
02:38:22,240 --> 02:38:23,519
'I'm afraid I must leave now.

3224
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:25,519
Would you like a lift, Crawley?'

3225
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:28,241
Maxim walked with them to the car.

3226
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:31,040
When they had gone, he came back to me on
the terrace.

3227
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:34,720
'It's going to be all right,' Maxim said.

3228
02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:36,320
'There won't be any trouble at the inquest.

3229
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:38,240
There is nothing to show what I did.

3230
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:42,479
Colonel Julyan thinks she was trapped in the
cabin and the jury will think that too.'

3231
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:44,400
I said nothing.

3232
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:48,720
'It's you I'm sorry for,' Maxim told me sadly.

3233
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:50,880
'I don't care about anything else.

3234
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:53,201
I'm glad that I killed Rebecca.

3235
02:38:54,160 --> 02:38:55,920
But I can't forget what this has done to you.

3236
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:58,960
You have lost that young, sweet look.

3237
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:00,640
And it will never come back.

3238
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:04,640
In twenty-four hours, you have grown so much
older.'

3239
02:39:07,120 --> 02:39:09,840
Frith brought in the newspapers at breakfast
the following day.

3240
02:39:10,479 --> 02:39:11,679
The story was in all of them.

3241
02:39:12,399 --> 02:39:15,200
There was a picture of Manderley and an awful
one of Maxim.

3242
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:19,840
All the papers said that Rebecca's body had
been found after the Fancy Dress Ball.

3243
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:22,560
They said how everyone had loved Rebecca.

3244
02:39:23,439 --> 02:39:27,679
They all said that Maxim had married his young,
second wife within a year of Rebecca's death.

3245
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:29,760
It all made a good story.

3246
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:32,640
Maxim's face went whiter and whiter.

3247
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:36,319
I wondered what the papers would say if they
knew the truth.

3248
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:40,880
That terrible word - murder - would be on
every front page.

3249
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:43,599
Frank was a great help to us.

3250
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:46,720
We had no more phone calls from reporters
and no visitors.

3251
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:51,840
It was just a question of waiting - of waiting
until Tuesday.

3252
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:55,440
Maxim and I stayed quietly in the house or
in the gardens.

3253
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:58,399
We did not walk in the woods or go down to
the sea.

3254
02:39:59,439 --> 02:40:01,919
The weather was very hot and the air was heavy.

3255
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:05,840
There were clouds, but the rain did not fall.

3256
02:40:16,319 --> 02:40:17,200
CHAPTER TWENTY

3257
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:19,840
The Inquest

3258
02:40:21,279 --> 02:40:22,559
Tuesday came at last.

3259
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:24,559
The inquest was at two o'clock.

3260
02:40:25,359 --> 02:40:27,839
After an early lunch, I drove into the town
with Maxim.

3261
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:31,600
'I think I shall stay here in the car,' I
said.

3262
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:34,080
'I won't come in with you after all.'

3263
02:40:34,080 --> 02:40:36,319
'I didn't want you to come,' Maxim said.

3264
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:38,400
'I wish you had stayed at Manderley.'

3265
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:41,920
Maxim went off and left me sitting there.

3266
02:40:42,640 --> 02:40:43,760
The minutes went by.

3267
02:40:44,319 --> 02:40:46,080
I wondered what was happening at the inquest.

3268
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:49,120
I got out of the car and began walking up
and down.

3269
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:51,279
A policeman looked at me.

3270
02:40:52,880 --> 02:40:55,040
'Excuse me, Madam,' he said.

3271
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:56,160
'Aren't you Mrs de Winter?

3272
02:40:56,800 --> 02:40:58,320
You can wait inside if you like.'

3273
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:01,920
The policeman took me into an empty room.

3274
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:02,960
Five minutes passed.

3275
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:03,680
Nothing happened.

3276
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:06,479
I got up and walked out of the little room.

3277
02:41:06,479 --> 02:41:08,160
The policeman was still standing there.

3278
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:10,080
'How long will they be?'

3279
02:41:10,640 --> 02:41:11,201
I asked him.

3280
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,880
'I'll go and see if you like,' the policeman
said.

3281
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:16,240
He was back again in a moment.

3282
02:41:17,359 --> 02:41:19,519
'It won't last much longer,' he told me.

3283
02:41:20,319 --> 02:41:23,200
'Mr de Winter has just finished giving his
evidence.

3284
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:25,760
There's only the boat-builder, Mr Tabb, to
speak now.

3285
02:41:26,479 --> 02:41:27,839
Would you like to go in?

3286
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:29,840
There's an empty seat near the door.'

3287
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:32,000
I followed the policeman.

3288
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:35,600
He opened the door for me and I went in quietly
and sat down.

3289
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:38,320
The room was small and full of people.

3290
02:41:38,960 --> 02:41:40,480
The air was hot and stuffy.

3291
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:44,240
Frank was sitting next to Maxim.

3292
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:48,559
To my surprise, Mrs Danvers was there too,
with Favell beside her.

3293
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:50,960
I wondered whether Maxim had seen him.

3294
02:41:52,399 --> 02:41:54,559
Tabb, the boat-builder, standing in the centre 

3295
02:41:54,560 --> 02:41:58,240
of the room, was answering 
the Coroner's questions.

3296
02:41:58,240 --> 02:41:59,760
'Was the boat in good condition?'

3297
02:42:00,319 --> 02:42:01,439
the Coroner was asking.

3298
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:06,800
'Yes, it certainly was the last time I saw
it,' Tabb said.

3299
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:09,040
'It was a strong little boat.

3300
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:11,840
I can't understand why it sank that night.'

3301
02:42:13,279 --> 02:42:15,679
'Accidents have happened before,' the Coroner
said.

3302
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:19,520
'Mrs de Winter was careless for a moment and
she died.'

3303
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:23,360
'Excuse me, sir,' said the boat-builder.

3304
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:25,840
'I would like to say something else.'

3305
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:29,840
'Very well, go on,' said the Coroner.

3306
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:31,920
'It's this, sir.

3307
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:36,000
There was nothing wrong with that boat when
I last saw it.

3308
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
So what I want to know is this.

3309
02:42:38,880 --> 02:42:41,600
Who made those holes in the planks?

3310
02:42:42,319 --> 02:42:43,279
Rocks didn't do it.

3311
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,080
The boat sank too far away from them.

3312
02:42:46,640 --> 02:42:48,960
And those holes were mad with something sharp.'

3313
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:51,519
I could not look at anyone.

3314
02:42:52,160 --> 02:42:53,840
I stared down at the floor.

3315
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:57,040
For a moment, the Coroner was too surprised
to speak.

3316
02:42:57,760 --> 02:43:00,000
Then he said, 'What do you mean?

3317
02:43:00,640 --> 02:43:01,600
What sort of holes?'

3318
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:05,840
'There were three of them, in different parts
of the boat.

3319
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:08,319
And that's not all.

3320
02:43:08,319 --> 02:43:10,719
The sea-cocks had been turned full on.'

3321
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:12,800
'The sea-cocks?

3322
02:43:12,800 --> 02:43:15,649
What are they?' asked the Coroner.

3323
02:43:15,649 --> 02:43:19,680
'The sea-cocks close the pipes leading to
the wash-basins, sir.

3324
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:23,760
They must be kept tightly closed when the
boat is sailing.

3325
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:25,920
Otherwise the sea water comes in.'

3326
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:30,000
It was hot in that crowded room, far too hot.

3327
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,760
I wished someone would open a window.

3328
02:43:32,399 --> 02:43:33,920
The boat-builder was speaking again.

3329
02:43:34,960 --> 02:43:40,319
'With those holes, sir, and the sea-cocks
open, a small boat like Mrs de Winter's would

3330
02:43:40,319 --> 02:43:41,200
soon sink.

3331
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:45,040
It's my opinion that there was no accident.

3332
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:46,960
That boat was sunk on purpose.'

3333
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:50,319
I must try and get out of the door, I thought.

3334
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:51,840
There was no air.

3335
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:55,439
People were standing up and talking loudly.

3336
02:43:55,439 --> 02:43:58,160
I heard the Coroner say, 'Mr de Winter.'

3337
02:43:59,279 --> 02:44:00,719
Maxim was standing up.

3338
02:44:00,720 --> 02:44:01,760
I could not look at him.

3339
02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:07,520
'Mr de Winter,' the Coroner said, 'you have
heard James Tabb's evidence.

3340
02:44:07,520 --> 02:44:09,600
Do you know anything about those holes?'

3341
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:11,380
'Nothing.'

3342
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:14,081
'Can you think why they are there?'

3343
02:44:15,359 --> 02:44:16,559
'No, of course not.'

3344
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:20,319
'This news is a shock to you, of course?'

3345
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:22,800
'Of course it is a shock.

3346
02:44:23,359 --> 02:44:25,200
Does it surprise you that I am shocked?'

3347
02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:27,840
Maxim's voice was hard and angry.

3348
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:31,840
Oh God, I thought, don't let Maxim lose his
temper.

3349
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:34,240
The Coroner was speaking again.

3350
02:44:35,359 --> 02:44:39,599
'Mr de Winter, I want to find out exactly
how your late wife died.

3351
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:42,160
Who looked after Mrs de Winter's boat?'

3352
02:44:43,279 --> 02:44:44,559
'She looked after it herself.'

3353
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:52,000
'Then whoever took the boat out that night
also made those holes and opened the sea-cocks.'

3354
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:53,920
'I suppose so.'

3355
02:44:55,359 --> 02:44:58,799
'You have told us that the door and windows
of the cabin were shut?'

3356
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:00,260
'Yes.'

3357
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:03,920
'Doesn't this seem very strange to you, Mr
de Winter?'

3358
02:45:04,720 --> 02:45:05,760
'Yes, it does.'

3359
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:10,240
'Mr de Winter, I'm afraid I must ask you one
other question.

3360
02:45:10,880 --> 02:45:14,720
Were you and the late Mrs de Winter happily
married?'

3361
02:45:16,080 --> 02:45:18,000
It was hot, so hot.

3362
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:20,480
I tried to stand up, but I could not.

3363
02:45:21,279 --> 02:45:22,800
The ground came up to meet me.

3364
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:25,759
And then I heard Maxim's voice, clear and
strong.

3365
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:28,560
'Will someone take my wife outside?

3366
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:29,440
She is going to faint.'

3367
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:34,000
I was sitting in the little room again.

3368
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,120
Frank was beside me.

3369
02:45:36,160 --> 02:45:37,680
'I'm sorry,' I said.

3370
02:45:38,399 --> 02:45:39,679
'It was so hot in there.'

3371
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:43,040
'Are you feeling better, Mrs de Winter?'

3372
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:43,760
Frank asked.

3373
02:45:44,399 --> 02:45:46,639
'Maxim has told me to take you back to Manderley.'

3374
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:48,800
Frank helped me to get up.

3375
02:45:49,680 --> 02:45:51,600
'I'd much rather stay,' I said.

3376
02:45:52,160 --> 02:45:53,439
'I want to wait for Maxim.'

3377
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:57,280
'Maxim may be some time,' Frank told me.

3378
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,920
'They may have to go over the evidence again.'

3379
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:02,320
'But what are they trying to find out?'

3380
02:46:03,359 --> 02:46:04,479
Frank did not answer.

3381
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:07,680
We were in his car now and he was driving
very fast.

3382
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:10,640
'Did you see Favell there?'

3383
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:11,201
I asked.

3384
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:13,280
'He was sitting with Mrs Danvers.

3385
02:46:14,319 --> 02:46:15,759
I don't trust them, Frank.

3386
02:46:15,760 --> 02:46:16,720
They might make trouble.'

3387
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:19,040
Frank did not answer.

3388
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:21,680
He could not know how much Maxim had told
me.

3389
02:46:22,399 --> 02:46:23,839
Then we were back at Manderley.

3390
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:26,399
'Will you be all right now?'

3391
02:46:26,399 --> 02:46:27,200
Frank asked me.

3392
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:28,960
'I shall go back.

3393
02:46:28,960 --> 02:46:30,000
Maxim may want me.'

3394
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:33,439
He got quickly back into the car again and
drove away.

3395
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:38,160
I went upstairs to my room, and lay down on
my bed.

3396
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:39,439
What were they all saying now?

3397
02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:41,040
What was happening?

3398
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:44,800
What would I do if Frank came back to Manderley
without Maxim?

3399
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:48,560
I thought again of that dreadful word - murder.

3400
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:51,840
God, let me not think about it.

3401
02:46:51,840 --> 02:46:53,760
Let me think about something else, anything...

3402
02:46:56,720 --> 02:46:58,000
I must have fallen asleep.

3403
02:46:58,720 --> 02:46:59,840
I woke up suddenly.

3404
02:47:00,640 --> 02:47:01,600
It was five o'clock.

3405
02:47:02,319 --> 02:47:03,759
I got up and went to the window.

3406
02:47:04,479 --> 02:47:05,839
There was no wind.

3407
02:47:06,399 --> 02:47:08,240
Lightning flashed against the grey sky.

3408
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:10,560
I heard thunder in the distance.

3409
02:47:11,359 --> 02:47:13,200
A few drops of rain began to fall.

3410
02:47:14,479 --> 02:47:19,839
I went downstairs and sat with Jasper in the
library.

3411
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:28,560
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE

3412
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:30,000
A Visit From Jack Favell

3413
02:47:31,920 --> 02:47:34,800
It was after six when I heard the sound of
Maxim's car.

3414
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:39,520
I tried to stand up but my legs were so weak
that I had to lean against a chair.

3415
02:47:40,640 --> 02:47:42,720
Maxim came into the room and stood by the
door.

3416
02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:45,120
He looked tired and old.

3417
02:47:46,399 --> 02:47:47,839
'It's all over,' he said.

3418
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:49,600
I waited.

3419
02:47:50,479 --> 02:47:52,559
I could not speak or walk towards him.

3420
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:55,600
'Suicide,' Maxim said.

3421
02:47:56,240 --> 02:47:57,120
'That's the verdict.

3422
02:47:57,760 --> 02:47:59,360
They said that Rebecca killed herself.'

3423
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:01,840
I sat down.

3424
02:48:02,479 --> 02:48:04,399
'Suicide,' I repeated.

3425
02:48:05,359 --> 02:48:06,880
'Why do they think Rebecca did that?'

3426
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:10,000
'God knows,' Maxim said.

3427
02:48:11,279 --> 02:48:12,639
He went and stood by the window.

3428
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:15,840
'There's one more thing to be done.

3429
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:17,440
Rebecca's body has to be buried.

3430
02:48:18,560 --> 02:48:20,479
I'm going down to the church now.

3431
02:48:20,479 --> 02:48:22,160
We'll talk about everything when I get back.

3432
02:48:23,359 --> 02:48:25,439
We've got to start our lives all over again.

3433
02:48:26,319 --> 02:48:28,240
The past can't hurt us if we are together.

3434
02:48:29,279 --> 02:48:31,120
We'll have children too, I promise you.

3435
02:48:32,399 --> 02:48:33,759
I must go now.

3436
02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:35,840
I'm meeting Frank and Colonel Julyan at the
church.'

3437
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:40,879
He left the room quickly and then I heard
the sound of his car driving away.

3438
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:44,241
It was quiet in the library.

3439
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:47,760
I thought about the church where Rebecca was
being buried at last.

3440
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:51,840
Just before seven, the rain began to fall
heavily.

3441
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:55,120
I opened the windows to let in the cold, clean
air.

3442
02:48:56,319 --> 02:48:59,279
The rain was falling so heavily that I did
not hear Frith come in.

3443
02:49:00,720 --> 02:49:03,359
'Excuse me, Madam,' he said.

3444
02:49:03,359 --> 02:49:05,439
'There's a gentleman to see Mr de Winter.

3445
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:07,279
It's Mr Favell.'

3446
02:49:08,560 --> 02:49:09,600
I was very surprised.

3447
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:13,359
'I think I had better see Mr Favell,' I said.

3448
02:49:14,479 --> 02:49:15,759
'Bring him in here, please, Frith.'

3449
02:49:17,359 --> 02:49:20,000
I hoped that Favell would go before Maxim
came back.

3450
02:49:20,800 --> 02:49:22,560
I could not think why Favell had come.

3451
02:49:24,160 --> 02:49:28,000
'I'm afraid Maxim is not here,' I said, when
Favell walked into the room.

3452
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:30,160
His eyes were red.

3453
02:49:30,800 --> 02:49:32,240
I wondered if he had been drinking.

3454
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:35,919
'I don't mind waiting,' Favell replied.

3455
02:49:36,640 --> 02:49:38,560
'Max will be back for dinner, I'm sure.'

3456
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:41,121
'Mr Favell,' I said.

3457
02:49:41,680 --> 02:49:44,320
'I don't want to be rude, but I am very tired.

3458
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:47,040
It will be better if you come back in the
morning.'

3459
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:52,160
'No, no,' he said, coming towards me, 'I've
got something to say to Max.

3460
02:49:52,960 --> 02:49:54,319
This has been a shock to me, you know.

3461
02:49:54,880 --> 02:49:56,480
I was very fond of Rebecca.'

3462
02:49:57,439 --> 02:49:58,559
'Yes, of course,' I said.

3463
02:49:59,120 --> 02:50:00,319
'I'm very sorry for you.'

3464
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:06,000
'I was fonder of Rebecca than of anyone else
in the world,' Favell went on.

3465
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:07,920
'And she was fond of me.

3466
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:10,000
That's why I've come here to find out the
truth.

3467
02:50:10,880 --> 02:50:12,240
Suicide...

3468
02:50:12,240 --> 02:50:13,200
my God.

3469
02:50:13,760 --> 02:50:16,240
You and I know it wasn't suicide, don't we?'

3470
02:50:17,439 --> 02:50:22,240
As Favell was speaking, the door opened and
Maxim and Frank came in.

3471
02:50:22,240 --> 02:50:23,439
'What the hell are you doing here?'

3472
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:25,120
Maxim said to Favell.

3473
02:50:26,080 --> 02:50:29,680
'Why, hello, Max, old man,' Favell said.

3474
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:32,241
'You must be feeling very pleased with yourself.'

3475
02:50:33,680 --> 02:50:37,279
'Do you mind leaving the house?' said Maxim
coldly.

3476
02:50:37,279 --> 02:50:38,319
'I don't want you here.'

3477
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:43,200
'Now, wait a minute, Max,' Favell answered.

3478
02:50:43,200 --> 02:50:45,200
'You've been very lucky.

3479
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:47,840
But I can still make life unpleasant for you.

3480
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:49,840
And dangerous too, perhaps.'

3481
02:50:50,399 --> 02:50:52,000
Maxim stared hard at Favell.

3482
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:54,399
'Oh yes?' he said.

3483
02:50:54,960 --> 02:50:57,040
'In what way can you make things dangerous?'

3484
02:50:58,800 --> 02:51:02,640
'I'll tell you, Max,' said Favell with an
unpleasant smile.

3485
02:51:03,439 --> 02:51:05,359
'You know all about Rebecca and me.

3486
02:51:05,920 --> 02:51:07,200
Her death was a great shock.

3487
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:10,800
Then I read about Rebecca's boat and the body
in the cabin.

3488
02:51:11,439 --> 02:51:12,879
So I went to the inquest.

3489
02:51:12,880 --> 02:51:14,880
I heard the boat-builder's evidence.

3490
02:51:15,439 --> 02:51:17,839
What about those holes in the boat, Max?'

3491
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:21,760
'You heard the verdict,' Maxim told him.

3492
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:22,800
'I have nothing more to say.'

3493
02:51:23,840 --> 02:51:24,720
Favell laughed.

3494
02:51:25,600 --> 02:51:28,000
'You know Rebecca didn't kill herself.

3495
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:29,760
I've a note here that may interest you.

3496
02:51:30,319 --> 02:51:33,120
I kept it because it was the last thing Rebecca
ever wrote to me.

3497
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:34,260
Listen.'

3498
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:38,000
Favell took a piece of paper from his pocket.

3499
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,399
I recognized Rebecca's hard, black writing.

3500
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,960
"I tried to phone you," Favell read, "but
you were out.

3501
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:48,800
I'm leaving London now and 
going back to Manderley.

3502
02:51:48,800 --> 02:51:50,240
I'll wait for you in the cottage.

3503
02:51:51,040 --> 02:51:52,399
Come down as soon as you can.

3504
02:51:52,960 --> 02:51:54,760
I've got something to tell you."

3505
02:51:54,760 --> 02:51:55,760
'

3506
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:57,600
Favell put the note back in his pocket.

3507
02:51:58,640 --> 02:52:00,480
'I found that in my London flat.

3508
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:03,200
It was too late to drive down to Manderley.

3509
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:06,160
When I phoned the following day, Rebecca was
dead.

3510
02:52:06,880 --> 02:52:09,840
Do you really think Rebecca killed herself
after writing that note?'

3511
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:12,240
Maxim said nothing.

3512
02:52:13,680 --> 02:52:19,600
'Now, Max, old man,' Favell said at last,
'you know I'm not a rich man.

3513
02:52:20,319 --> 02:52:24,240
If I had two or three thousand pounds, I could
live quite well.

3514
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:28,080
I'd never come back, I promise you.'

3515
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:31,600
'I've already asked you to leave the house,'
Maxim said.

3516
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:32,960
'The door is behind you.'

3517
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:35,040
Favell laughed again.

3518
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:38,399
'Think again, Max,' said Favell.

3519
02:52:39,200 --> 02:52:43,200
'I don't suppose your new bride wants to be
known as the wife of a murderer.'

3520
02:52:44,399 --> 02:52:47,120
'You can't frighten me, Favell,' Maxim answered.

3521
02:52:47,840 --> 02:52:49,760
'Shall I phone Colonel Julyan?

3522
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:51,280
You can tell your story to him.'

3523
02:52:52,080 --> 02:52:54,960
'You wouldn't dare, Max,' said Favell.

3524
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:58,080
'I have enough evidence to hang you, Max.'

3525
02:52:59,279 --> 02:53:02,000
Maxim walked slowly towards the telephone
in the next room.

3526
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:04,319
'Stop him,' I said to Frank.

3527
02:53:04,319 --> 02:53:05,439
'Stop him for God's sake.'

3528
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:07,279
But it was too late.

3529
02:53:07,279 --> 02:53:08,639
Maxim was already speaking.

3530
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:11,200
'Is that Colonel Julyan?

3531
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:12,080
It's de Winter here.

3532
02:53:12,640 --> 02:53:14,320
Could you come over to Manderley at once?

3533
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:17,120
No - I can't say anything over the phone.

3534
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:19,520
Thank you very much, goodbye.'

3535
02:53:21,359 --> 02:53:24,240
Maxim came back again into the room.

3536
02:53:24,240 --> 02:53:26,719
'Colonel Julyan will be here in ten minutes,'
he said.

3537
02:53:27,840 --> 02:53:29,040
We waited in silence.

3538
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:32,320
The rain was so heavy that we did not hear
the sound of the car.

3539
02:53:33,120 --> 02:53:36,720
We were taken by surprise when Frith brought
the magistrate into the library.

3540
02:53:37,760 --> 02:53:40,560
'Good evening, Colonel Julyan,' Maxim said
at once.

3541
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:43,359
'This is Jack Favell, my late wife's cousin.

3542
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:45,359
He has something to say to you.'

3543
02:53:46,319 --> 02:53:48,000
Favell went up to Colonel Julyan.

3544
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:51,040
'I'm not happy about the verdict.

3545
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:52,560
I want you to read this note.

3546
02:53:53,359 --> 02:53:56,399
Tell me whether you think the writer had decided
to kill herself.'

3547
02:53:57,680 --> 02:53:59,920
Colonel Julyan took the note and read it slowly.

3548
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:03,600
'I see what you mean,' he said.

3549
02:54:04,399 --> 02:54:05,839
'But the note is not clear.

3550
02:54:06,479 --> 02:54:08,639
What do you think really happened to Mrs de
Winter?'

3551
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:11,200
Favell looked at Maxim.

3552
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:15,520
'I'll tell you what I think,' he said slowly.

3553
02:54:16,560 --> 02:54:18,800
'Rebecca never opened those sea-cocks.

3554
02:54:19,439 --> 02:54:21,759
She didn't make those holes in the boat.

3555
02:54:21,760 --> 02:54:23,359
Rebecca didn't kill herself.

3556
02:54:23,359 --> 02:54:24,639
I say she was murdered.

3557
02:54:25,359 --> 02:54:27,200
Do you want to know who the murderer is?

3558
02:54:28,080 --> 02:54:30,080
He's there, standing by the window.

3559
02:54:30,960 --> 02:54:34,640
Mr Maximilian de Winter - he's your murderer.

3560
02:54:35,200 --> 02:54:36,479
Take a good look at him.'

3561
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:43,600
Favell began to laugh, a high stupid laugh,
as he twisted the note round and round in

3562
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:47,840
his fingers.

3563
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:01,760
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO

3564
02:55:01,760 --> 02:55:02,880
Rebecca's Diary

3565
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:07,680
Thank God for Favell's laugh.

3566
02:55:08,479 --> 02:55:11,359
I saw a look of disgust come into Colonel
Julyan's face.

3567
02:55:12,479 --> 02:55:14,559
'The man's drunk,' he said quickly.

3568
02:55:14,560 --> 02:55:15,840
'He doesn't know what he's saying.'

3569
02:55:16,560 --> 02:55:19,040
'Drunk, am I?' shouted Favell.

3570
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:20,640
'Oh no, I'm not drunk.

3571
02:55:21,279 --> 02:55:24,240
Max de Winter murdered Rebecca, and I'm going
to prove it.'

3572
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:27,279
'Wait a minute,' said Colonel Julyan.

3573
02:55:27,840 --> 02:55:29,840
'I want to hear your proof.'

3574
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:32,161
'Proof?' said Favell.

3575
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:35,600
'Aren't those holes in the boat enough proof
for you?'

3576
02:55:36,560 --> 02:55:38,720
'Certainly not,' said Colonel Julyan.

3577
02:55:39,359 --> 02:55:41,599
'Unless you can find someone who saw him do
it.'

3578
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:46,080
'I'll get your proof for you,' shouted Favell.

3579
02:55:46,720 --> 02:55:49,280
'De Winter killed Rebecca because of me.

3580
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,319
He was jealous because she loved me.

3581
02:55:52,960 --> 02:55:55,359
He went down to the cottage and killed her
there.

3582
02:55:55,920 --> 02:55:56,560
Wait a minute...

3583
02:55:57,279 --> 02:55:59,519
I think I can find someone who saw him.'

3584
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:02,480
I suddenly knew what Favell meant.

3585
02:56:03,279 --> 02:56:08,399
Someone had seen it all happen - someone who
was often down there in the bay - Ben.

3586
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:13,520
'There's an idiot who was always around the
cottage,' Favell said.

3587
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:15,200
'He often slept on the beach.

3588
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:16,800
I'm sure he saw everything.'

3589
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:21,200
'Can we get this man and question him?' asked
Colonel Julyan.

3590
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:24,081
'Of course,' said Maxim.

3591
02:56:24,720 --> 02:56:25,840
'His name is Ben.

3592
02:56:26,720 --> 02:56:28,160
Could you go and get him, Frank?

3593
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:28,800
Take your car.'

3594
02:56:29,680 --> 02:56:30,880
Frank went out quickly.

3595
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:33,600
Favell laughed angrily.

3596
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:34,800
His face was very red.

3597
02:56:35,920 --> 02:56:39,359
'You all help each other down here, don't
you?' he said.

3598
02:56:39,359 --> 02:56:40,799
'Crawley knows the truth, I'm sure.

3599
02:56:41,439 --> 02:56:45,040
He'll be there to hold the young bride's arm
when Max is sentenced to death.'

3600
02:56:46,319 --> 02:56:49,439
Without warning, Maxim went up to Favell and
hit him hard.

3601
02:56:50,080 --> 02:56:51,760
Favell fell heavily to the floor.

3602
02:56:52,720 --> 02:56:54,400
I wished that Maxim had not hit him.

3603
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:59,680
Favell got slowly to his feet, walked over
to a small table and poured himself some whisky.

3604
02:57:00,560 --> 02:57:03,040
I saw Colonel Julyan look thoughtfully at
Maxim.

3605
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:05,840
Was he beginning to believe Favell's story?

3606
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:08,560
The door opened and Frank came in.

3607
02:57:10,080 --> 02:57:12,000
'All right, Ben,' he said quietly.

3608
02:57:12,560 --> 02:57:13,360
'Don't be frightened.'

3609
02:57:14,800 --> 02:57:17,760
Ben stepped into the room and stared at everyone
with his small eyes.

3610
02:57:18,479 --> 02:57:19,599
Favell walked up to him.

3611
02:57:20,560 --> 02:57:23,040
'You know who I am, don't you?' he said.

3612
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:24,800
Ben did not answer.

3613
02:57:25,520 --> 02:57:27,760
'Come on,' said Favell.

3614
02:57:27,760 --> 02:57:29,520
'You've seen me in the cottage, haven't you?'

3615
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:32,000
Ben held Frank's arm.

3616
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:36,000
'I've never seen him,' he said.

3617
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:37,680
'Is he going to take me away?'

3618
02:57:38,960 --> 02:57:41,760
'No, of course not,' said Colonel Julyan.

3619
02:57:42,640 --> 02:57:43,840
'Now listen to me, Ben.

3620
02:57:44,640 --> 02:57:46,241
You remember the lady with the boat.

3621
02:57:47,040 --> 02:57:50,399
Were you on the beach when she took her boat
out for the last time?'

3622
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:55,200
'You were there, weren't you?' said Favell,
standing over Ben.

3623
02:57:56,080 --> 02:58:00,319
'You saw Mrs de Winter go into the cottage
and Mr de Winter too.

3624
02:58:00,319 --> 02:58:01,439
What happened then?'

3625
02:58:02,640 --> 02:58:04,880
Ben shook his head and moved back against
the wall.

3626
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:08,960
'I didn't see anything,' he said.

3627
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:09,920
He began to cry.

3628
02:58:11,120 --> 02:58:15,920
'You damned little idiot,' Favell said slowly.

3629
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:20,800
'I think Ben can go home now, don't you, Colonel
Julyan?'

3630
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:21,520
Maxim said.

3631
02:58:22,479 --> 02:58:25,279
Frank took Ben out of the room as the Colonel
nodded his head.

3632
02:58:26,720 --> 02:58:29,120
'That poor fellow was terrified,' he said.

3633
02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:31,840
'He's no use to you, Favell.

3634
02:58:31,840 --> 02:58:33,600
I'm afraid you can't prove your story.'

3635
02:58:34,880 --> 02:58:36,000
Favell did not answer.

3636
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:42,000
Instead, he rang the bell and when Frith came
in, he said, 'Ask Mrs Danvers to come here,

3637
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:42,500
Frith.'

3638
02:58:43,920 --> 02:58:45,840
'Isn't Mrs Danvers the housekeeper?'

3639
02:58:46,479 --> 02:58:48,559
asked Colonel Julyan as Frith left the room.

3640
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,560
'She was also Rebecca's friend.

3641
02:58:52,560 --> 02:58:56,560
She knew her for years,' Favell said, with
his unpleasant smile.

3642
02:58:57,680 --> 02:58:59,920
We all waited, watching the door.

3643
02:58:59,920 --> 02:59:02,319
Then Mrs Danvers came in and shut the door
behind her.

3644
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:06,480
'Good evening, Mrs Danvers,' Colonel Julyan
said.

3645
02:59:07,279 --> 02:59:08,800
'I would like to ask you a question.

3646
02:59:09,680 --> 02:59:11,680
You knew the late Mrs de Winter well.

3647
02:59:12,880 --> 02:59:16,480
Mr Favell has told us that Mrs de Winter was
in love with him.

3648
02:59:17,120 --> 02:59:17,840
Is that true?'

3649
02:59:19,279 --> 02:59:22,240
'No, it is not,' Mrs Danvers answered.

3650
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:27,840
'Now, listen, Danny,' Favell began to shout,
but Mrs Danvers took no notice.

3651
02:59:29,279 --> 02:59:31,439
'She was not in love with you, Mr Jack.

3652
02:59:31,439 --> 02:59:32,639
Or with Mr de Winter.

3653
02:59:33,200 --> 02:59:34,479
She was not in love with anyone.

3654
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:36,479
She thought men were fools.

3655
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:39,279
She amused herself with you, that was all.'

3656
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:41,840
Maxim went very white.

3657
02:59:42,479 --> 02:59:45,839
Favell stared at Mrs Danvers as though he
did not understand her.

3658
02:59:47,200 --> 02:59:53,439
'Mrs Danvers,' Colonel Julyan said quietly,
'can you think of any reason why Mrs de Winter

3659
02:59:53,439 --> 02:59:54,160
killed herself?'

3660
02:59:55,200 --> 02:59:56,559
Mrs Danvers shook her head.

3661
02:59:57,680 --> 03:00:00,241
'No, certainly not,' she said.

3662
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:02,240
'There you are!

3663
03:00:02,240 --> 03:00:03,200
What did I tell you?'

3664
03:00:03,760 --> 03:00:04,640
Favell shouted.

3665
03:00:05,279 --> 03:00:06,880
'Be quiet, will you.

3666
03:00:06,880 --> 03:00:08,720
Let Mrs Danvers read the note.

3667
03:00:08,720 --> 03:00:11,600
She may understand it,' Colonel Julyan said.

3668
03:00:12,640 --> 03:00:15,920
Mrs Danvers took the note, read it and then
shook her head again.

3669
03:00:17,439 --> 03:00:18,559
'I don't know what she meant.

3670
03:00:19,359 --> 03:00:21,759
If it was something important, she would have
told me.'

3671
03:00:23,120 --> 03:00:26,399
'Can you tell us how Mrs de Winter spent that
last day in London?

3672
03:00:27,279 --> 03:00:28,960
Did she keep a diary?'

3673
03:00:28,960 --> 03:00:30,000
asked Colonel Julyan.

3674
03:00:31,279 --> 03:00:34,559
'I've got her diary in my room,' Mrs Danvers
replied.

3675
03:00:35,200 --> 03:00:36,319
'I kept all her things.

3676
03:00:37,040 --> 03:00:37,840
I'll go and get it.'

3677
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:44,480
'Well, de Winter,' said Colonel Julyan, 'do
you mind us seeing this diary?'

3678
03:00:45,680 --> 03:00:47,440
'Of course not,' said Maxim.

3679
03:00:48,319 --> 03:00:51,840
Once again, I saw Colonel Julyan give Maxim
a hard look.

3680
03:00:52,399 --> 03:00:53,839
This time Frank saw it too.

3681
03:00:54,960 --> 03:00:57,760
Somehow I felt sure that the truth was in
that diary.

3682
03:00:59,200 --> 03:01:01,599
Mrs Danvers came back with a small book in
her hand.

3683
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:06,319
'Here is the page for the day Mrs de Winter
died,' she said.

3684
03:01:07,200 --> 03:01:08,880
Colonel Julyan looked at it carefully.

3685
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:12,240
'Yes,' he said, 'here it is.

3686
03:01:12,880 --> 03:01:14,560
Hairdressers at twelve o'clock.

3687
03:01:15,200 --> 03:01:16,240
Then lunch.

3688
03:01:16,240 --> 03:01:20,240
And then - Baker - two o'clock.

3689
03:01:20,240 --> 03:01:21,040
Who was Baker?'

3690
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:23,279
He looked at Maxim.

3691
03:01:23,279 --> 03:01:24,399
Maxim shook his head.

3692
03:01:25,520 --> 03:01:26,020
'Baker?'

3693
03:01:26,640 --> 03:01:27,760
repeated Mrs Danvers.

3694
03:01:28,479 --> 03:01:29,919
'She knew no one called Baker.'

3695
03:01:31,200 --> 03:01:34,399
'We must find out who this person was,' said
Colonel Julyan.

3696
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:38,719
'If he wasn't a friend, perhaps it was someone
she was afraid of.'

3697
03:01:40,160 --> 03:01:43,040
'Mrs de Winter afraid?' said Mrs Danvers.

3698
03:01:43,760 --> 03:01:46,160
'She was afraid of nothing and no one.

3699
03:01:46,960 --> 03:01:48,160
Only one thing worried her.

3700
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:52,480
That was the thought of illness, of dying
slowly in her bed.'

3701
03:01:53,840 --> 03:01:56,000
'What does all this matter?' said Favell.

3702
03:01:56,800 --> 03:01:59,360
'If Baker was important Danny would know about
him.'

3703
03:02:00,319 --> 03:02:02,719
Mrs Danvers was turning the pages of the diary.

3704
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:06,241
'There's a telephone number here at the back,'
she said.

3705
03:02:06,880 --> 03:02:08,160
'And the name Baker again.'

3706
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:11,840
'Well,' said Maxim, lighting a cigarette.

3707
03:02:12,640 --> 03:02:14,400
'Perhaps someone should phone that number.

3708
03:02:15,120 --> 03:02:16,160
Would you mind, Frank?'

3709
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:20,800
Frank took the diary without a word and went
into the next room.

3710
03:02:21,680 --> 03:02:22,960
He shut the door behind him.

3711
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:27,680
When he came back, he said, 'That was a doctor's
number.

3712
03:02:27,680 --> 03:02:30,640
Dr Baker used to live there, but he left six
months ago.

3713
03:02:31,840 --> 03:02:33,760
They gave me his new address.

3714
03:02:33,760 --> 03:02:34,960
I have written it here.'

3715
03:02:35,680 --> 03:02:37,280
And Frank held out a piece of paper.

3716
03:02:38,479 --> 03:02:40,080
It was then that Maxim looked at me.

3717
03:02:41,120 --> 03:02:43,840
He looked at me like a man saying goodbye
for the last time.

3718
03:02:45,040 --> 03:02:47,519
That piece of paper was enough to hang Maxim.

3719
03:02:49,359 --> 03:02:51,279
I knew why Rebecca had gone to a doctor.

3720
03:02:51,920 --> 03:02:53,760
I knew what she had wanted to tell Favell.

3721
03:02:54,560 --> 03:02:56,400
Rebecca had been pregnant when she died.

3722
03:02:57,359 --> 03:02:58,639
She had been going to have a child.

3723
03:02:59,359 --> 03:03:02,880
It was the one clear proof that Rebecca had
not killed herself.

3724
03:03:04,080 --> 03:03:05,600
I was sure that this was the truth.

3725
03:03:06,399 --> 03:03:08,000
I knew Maxim thought so too.

3726
03:03:09,279 --> 03:03:11,840
'Well done, Frank,' said Maxim calmly.

3727
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:14,000
'Where does the doctor live now?'

3728
03:03:15,359 --> 03:03:17,599
'In north London,' Frank replied.

3729
03:03:18,399 --> 03:03:19,599
'But he's not on the phone.

3730
03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:22,800
He's a very well-known women's doctor.'

3731
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:25,840
'Well,' said Colonel Julyan.

3732
03:03:25,840 --> 03:03:27,920
'There must have been something wrong with
her after all.'

3733
03:03:29,279 --> 03:03:31,439
'I'll write him a letter,' Frank said.

3734
03:03:32,160 --> 03:03:35,519
'I don't think he would tell you anything,'
Colonel Julyan answered.

3735
03:03:36,160 --> 03:03:38,399
'I think de Winter should see him and explain.'

3736
03:03:39,600 --> 03:03:42,080
'I'm ready to go,' said Maxim quietly.

3737
03:03:42,960 --> 03:03:44,240
'Shall I go up in the morning?'

3738
03:03:45,680 --> 03:03:48,880
'He's not going alone,' Favell said with a
laugh.

3739
03:03:48,880 --> 03:03:50,240
'You go with him, Julyan.

3740
03:03:50,240 --> 03:03:51,519
And I think I'd better go too.

3741
03:03:52,160 --> 03:03:54,080
What time do we start?'

3742
03:03:54,080 --> 03:03:55,680
Colonel Julyan looked at Maxim.

3743
03:03:56,800 --> 03:03:58,160
'Nine o'clock?' he said.

3744
03:03:58,800 --> 03:04:00,400
'Perhaps you will take me in your car.'

3745
03:04:01,520 --> 03:04:04,640
'We'll meet at the crossroads just after nine,'
Favell said.

3746
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:06,080
He walked to the door.

3747
03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:10,160
'I suppose you're not going to ask me to dinner,
so I'll say goodbye.

3748
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:12,240
Come on, Danny.

3749
03:04:12,240 --> 03:04:13,920
I'll see you in the morning, Max.'

3750
03:04:15,200 --> 03:04:17,200
Colonel Julyan came up to me and took my hand.

3751
03:04:18,240 --> 03:04:19,439
'Good night,' he said.

3752
03:04:20,160 --> 03:04:22,160
'Get your husband to bed early.

3753
03:04:22,160 --> 03:04:23,599
Tomorrow will be a long day.'

3754
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:27,920
He held my hand for a moment, but he did not
look into my eyes.

3755
03:04:28,880 --> 03:04:30,319
He and Frank went out together.

3756
03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:32,720
Maxim and I were alone at last.

3757
03:04:34,640 --> 03:04:36,720
'I'm coming with you tomorrow,' I said.

3758
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:39,360
'Yes,' Maxim answered.

3759
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:41,760
'We must be together as long as we can.'

3760
03:04:43,279 --> 03:04:45,279
I put my arms around him and held him.

3761
03:04:45,920 --> 03:04:47,200
We did not say anything.

3762
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:49,840
Then Maxim held me tightly.

3763
03:04:50,399 --> 03:05:03,839
We began to kiss each other, like guilty lovers
who had never kissed before.

3764
03:05:11,120 --> 03:05:12,720
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE

3765
03:05:12,720 --> 03:05:13,440
Dr Baker

3766
03:05:14,960 --> 03:05:18,240
I woke up early the following morning at about
six o'clock.

3767
03:05:18,240 --> 03:05:19,679
I got up and went to the window.

3768
03:05:20,640 --> 03:05:22,479
The trees were covered in mist.

3769
03:05:22,479 --> 03:05:24,319
There was a sharp coolness in the air.

3770
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:26,080
Autumn had arrived.

3771
03:05:27,359 --> 03:05:29,679
This was the start of a new day at Manderley.

3772
03:05:30,560 --> 03:05:32,320
Soon the servants would be starting work.

3773
03:05:33,520 --> 03:05:36,480
Whatever happened to us, life at Manderley
would go on.

3774
03:05:37,840 --> 03:05:39,680
The peace of Manderley could not be broken.

3775
03:05:40,319 --> 03:05:41,920
Its beauty could not be destroyed.

3776
03:05:42,800 --> 03:05:45,840
The flowers would come every year, the birds
would sing.

3777
03:05:46,560 --> 03:05:50,320
Manderley would always be here, safe and secure,
within sound of the sea.

3778
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
Maxim slept on and I did not wake him.

3779
03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:57,200
The day ahead would be long and tiring.

3780
03:05:57,200 --> 03:05:58,720
London was many miles away.

3781
03:05:59,600 --> 03:06:02,000
We did not know what we should find at the
end of the journey.

3782
03:06:04,080 --> 03:06:06,240
Somewhere in London lived a man called Baker.

3783
03:06:06,880 --> 03:06:08,399
He had never heard of us.

3784
03:06:08,399 --> 03:06:10,000
But our future was in his hands.

3785
03:06:11,439 --> 03:06:13,839
I had a bath, dressed and then woke Maxim.

3786
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:16,320
He got up and went into the bathroom.

3787
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:18,399
I began to pack a few things.

3788
03:06:18,960 --> 03:06:20,960
We might have to stay overnight in London.

3789
03:06:22,160 --> 03:06:23,599
I looked at my small case.

3790
03:06:24,240 --> 03:06:26,160
It seemed so long since I had used it.

3791
03:06:26,880 --> 03:06:28,160
But it was only four months.

3792
03:06:28,880 --> 03:06:29,840
I could not believe it.

3793
03:06:31,600 --> 03:06:34,161
We had breakfast together and I went out on
to the terrace.

3794
03:06:34,800 --> 03:06:36,400
The air was fresh and clear now.

3795
03:06:37,040 --> 03:06:38,479
It was going to be a perfect day.

3796
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:43,280
At nine o'clock exactly, Frank brought up
Colonel Julyan in his car.

3797
03:06:44,319 --> 03:06:46,240
We were going in Maxim's car.

3798
03:06:46,240 --> 03:06:49,040
I sat beside Maxim and Colonel Julyan got
into the back.

3799
03:06:50,319 --> 03:06:52,160
'You will telephone, won't you?'

3800
03:06:52,160 --> 03:06:53,760
Frank said as he stood on the steps.

3801
03:06:54,640 --> 03:06:56,480
'Yes, of course,' Maxim said.

3802
03:06:57,520 --> 03:06:59,520
As we drove away, I looked back at the house.

3803
03:07:00,319 --> 03:07:01,759
It had never looked more beautiful.

3804
03:07:02,880 --> 03:07:05,120
For some reason, my eyes filled with tears.

3805
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:09,840
Then we were round the bend of the drive and
I could see the house no longer.

3806
03:07:10,560 --> 03:07:13,440
When we came to the crossroads, Favell was
already waiting.

3807
03:07:14,160 --> 03:07:16,319
He waved when he saw us and started up his
car.

3808
03:07:17,200 --> 03:07:19,279
I settled down for the long journey to London.

3809
03:07:20,240 --> 03:07:24,960
The hours passed and the miles went by, Favell's
car always behind us.

3810
03:07:26,240 --> 03:07:28,960
We had lunch somewhere and reached London
at about three o'clock.

3811
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:31,920
It was then that I began to feel tired.

3812
03:07:32,720 --> 03:07:34,720
It was warm and the streets were busy.

3813
03:07:35,520 --> 03:07:37,840
The drive through the centre of London seemed
very long.

3814
03:07:38,640 --> 03:07:41,920
Maxim looked pale and tired, but he did not
say anything.

3815
03:07:42,800 --> 03:07:44,880
Favell's car was always behind us.

3816
03:07:45,920 --> 03:07:48,160
We reached Baker's house at about five o'clock.

3817
03:07:48,960 --> 03:07:50,720
Maxim stopped the car and we got out.

3818
03:07:51,439 --> 03:07:52,719
Favell came up to meet us.

3819
03:07:53,520 --> 03:07:55,840
We all walked slowly up the path to the front
door.

3820
03:07:56,640 --> 03:07:58,080
Colonel Julyan rang the bell.

3821
03:07:59,279 --> 03:08:00,399
A woman opened the door.

3822
03:08:01,359 --> 03:08:04,319
'Is Dr Baker at home?' said Colonel Julyan.

3823
03:08:04,880 --> 03:08:06,080
'He is expecting us.

3824
03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:07,040
I sent a telegram.'

3825
03:08:08,160 --> 03:08:10,319
'Yes, of course,' said the woman.

3826
03:08:11,040 --> 03:08:12,800
'My husband is in the garden.

3827
03:08:12,800 --> 03:08:14,000
I'll tell him you are here.'

3828
03:08:15,359 --> 03:08:17,679
She took us into a cool room at the back of
the house.

3829
03:08:18,479 --> 03:08:21,679
She went out and in a few minutes a tall man
came into the room.

3830
03:08:22,880 --> 03:08:24,319
'I'm Dr Baker.

3831
03:08:24,319 --> 03:08:25,679
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

3832
03:08:26,319 --> 03:08:28,000
Please sit down,' he said.

3833
03:08:29,200 --> 03:08:32,559
'We are sorry to trouble you, Dr Baker,' Colonel
Julyan said.

3834
03:08:33,359 --> 03:08:34,719
'My name is Julyan.

3835
03:08:34,720 --> 03:08:38,080
This is Mr de Winter, Mrs de Winter and Mr
Favell.

3836
03:08:39,120 --> 03:08:41,840
We have come about the death of the late Mrs
de Winter.

3837
03:08:42,560 --> 03:08:44,640
You may have read the report in the papers.'

3838
03:08:45,600 --> 03:08:48,479
'The verdict was suicide,' Favell said.

3839
03:08:48,479 --> 03:08:50,240
'I knew Mrs de Winter very well.

3840
03:08:50,240 --> 03:08:51,519
She did not kill herself.

3841
03:08:51,520 --> 03:08:52,720
She had no reason to.

3842
03:08:53,359 --> 03:08:56,559
We want to know why she came to see you on
the day she died.'

3843
03:08:57,680 --> 03:08:59,120
Dr Baker looked surprised.

3844
03:09:00,160 --> 03:09:02,479
'I think you've made a mistake,' he said.

3845
03:09:03,120 --> 03:09:05,279
'No one called de Winter has ever come to
me.'

3846
03:09:06,720 --> 03:09:10,400
'But we found your old telephone number in
Mrs de Winter's diary.'

3847
03:09:11,359 --> 03:09:16,240
Dr Baker looked at the page from the diary
that Colonel Julyan was holding out to him.

3848
03:09:16,240 --> 03:09:18,800
'That certainly was my number,' he said.

3849
03:09:19,840 --> 03:09:24,000
'Perhaps Mrs de Winter gave you a different
name,' Colonel Julyan suggested.

3850
03:09:25,040 --> 03:09:28,160
'It's possible,' said Dr Baker slowly.

3851
03:09:29,439 --> 03:09:32,479
'If you have any record of a visit on that
day, could we see it?'

3852
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:34,080
Colonel Julyan asked.

3853
03:09:34,800 --> 03:09:36,000
'This is an important matter.'

3854
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:38,720
'Murder,' Favell said.

3855
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:41,280
'Of course,' said the doctor.

3856
03:09:42,080 --> 03:09:43,840
'I had no idea there was any question of that.

3857
03:09:44,720 --> 03:09:45,760
I'll go and get my book.'

3858
03:09:47,279 --> 03:09:49,679
While Dr Baker was out of the room, we said
nothing.

3859
03:09:50,560 --> 03:09:51,920
No one looked at anyone else.

3860
03:09:52,800 --> 03:09:54,960
Favell whistled quietly under his breath.

3861
03:09:56,239 --> 03:09:58,559
Dr Baker came back into the room with a large
book.

3862
03:09:59,279 --> 03:10:00,960
He opened the book and turned the pages.

3863
03:10:01,600 --> 03:10:03,121
We all stood watching his face.

3864
03:10:04,479 --> 03:10:09,519
'I saw a Mrs Danvers on the 12th at two o'clock,'
Dr Baker said at last.

3865
03:10:10,720 --> 03:10:12,080
'Danny?

3866
03:10:12,080 --> 03:10:12,580
Why did...?'

3867
03:10:13,120 --> 03:10:14,319
Favell began.

3868
03:10:14,319 --> 03:10:15,200
Maxim broke in.

3869
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:18,479
'Rebecca gave the wrong name, of course,'
he said.

3870
03:10:19,439 --> 03:10:21,279
'Do you remember the visit now, Doctor?'

3871
03:10:22,319 --> 03:10:24,479
But Dr Baker was already searching his files.

3872
03:10:25,040 --> 03:10:26,560
He picked out a card and read it.

3873
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:31,360
'Yes,' he said slowly, 'I remember now.'

3874
03:10:32,640 --> 03:10:35,840
'Was she tall and dark, a beautiful woman?'

3875
03:10:35,840 --> 03:10:36,960
Colonel Julyan asked.

3876
03:10:37,920 --> 03:10:39,840
'Yes,' said Dr Baker.

3877
03:10:40,479 --> 03:10:42,479
He put back the card and looked at Maxim.

3878
03:10:43,359 --> 03:10:44,719
The doctor spoke slowly.

3879
03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:50,319
'The woman who called herself Mrs Danvers
was very ill indeed.

3880
03:10:51,120 --> 03:10:52,640
She had come to me the week before.

3881
03:10:53,359 --> 03:10:54,559
I took some X-rays.

3882
03:10:55,359 --> 03:10:57,120
She had come back to hear the result.

3883
03:10:58,000 --> 03:10:59,520
I remember her words exactly.

3884
03:11:00,399 --> 03:11:02,319
"I want to know the truth," she said.

3885
03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:05,279
"If I'm really ill, I want to know."

3886
03:11:06,319 --> 03:11:07,840
So I told her.'

3887
03:11:08,640 --> 03:11:10,800
Dr Baker stopped and looked down at the files.

3888
03:11:11,920 --> 03:11:14,560
'There was nothing to be done,' he went on.

3889
03:11:14,560 --> 03:11:16,081
'An operation would have been useless.

3890
03:11:16,800 --> 03:11:17,600
I told her that.

3891
03:11:18,479 --> 03:11:21,839
In six months, she would have been dead.'

3892
03:11:22,720 --> 03:11:27,840
No one said a word and the doctor went on,
'Mrs de Winter looked a healthy woman.

3893
03:11:28,399 --> 03:11:30,319
She had very little pain at that time.

3894
03:11:31,040 --> 03:11:32,160
But the pain would have come.

3895
03:11:33,040 --> 03:11:36,319
The X-rays showed that she could never have
had a child.

3896
03:11:36,319 --> 03:11:38,479
But that was nothing to do with her illness.'

3897
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:41,040
Everyone was standing up.

3898
03:11:41,600 --> 03:11:45,121
We shook hands with Dr Baker and he walked
with us to the front door.

3899
03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:48,000
'Shall I send you my report?'

3900
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:48,960
Dr Baker asked.

3901
03:11:49,600 --> 03:11:51,840
'We may not need it,' said Colonel Julyan.

3902
03:11:52,479 --> 03:11:53,759
'We'll write to you if we do.

3903
03:11:54,399 --> 03:11:55,279
Thank you very much.'

3904
03:11:56,399 --> 03:11:59,359
'I am glad to have been of some use,' said
Dr Baker.

3905
03:12:00,160 --> 03:12:00,660
'Goodbye.'

3906
03:12:01,680 --> 03:12:03,840
And he shut the door.

3907
03:12:11,520 --> 03:12:13,279
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR

3908
03:12:13,279 --> 03:12:14,719
The Return to Manderley

3909
03:12:17,200 --> 03:12:18,559
We went and stood by the car.

3910
03:12:19,439 --> 03:12:21,120
No one said anything for a few minutes.

3911
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:23,280
Favell's face was grey.

3912
03:12:23,840 --> 03:12:25,680
His hand shook as he lit a cigarette.

3913
03:12:26,880 --> 03:12:30,080
'She kept it a secret from everyone, even
Danny.

3914
03:12:30,080 --> 03:12:32,720
It's been a dreadful shock to me,' Favell
said.

3915
03:12:33,600 --> 03:12:35,359
'You're all right, of course, Max.

3916
03:12:35,359 --> 03:12:36,639
You've been lucky, haven't you?

3917
03:12:37,200 --> 03:12:39,840
You and your young wife can go back to Manderley
now.

3918
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:46,000
You think you've won, but don't be too sure,
I haven't finished with you yet.'

3919
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:47,760
'Shall we get into the car and go?'

3920
03:12:48,479 --> 03:12:49,919
Colonel Julyan asked Maxim.

3921
03:12:50,880 --> 03:12:52,400
Favell smiled unpleasantly.

3922
03:12:53,359 --> 03:12:56,399
As we drove away, he was still standing there,
watching us.

3923
03:12:58,080 --> 03:13:00,880
'Favell can't do anything,' Colonel Julyan
told us.

3924
03:13:01,520 --> 03:13:03,920
'I'll soon deal with him if he comes near
Manderley again.

3925
03:13:04,720 --> 03:13:06,880
I don't think the papers will bother you any
more.

3926
03:13:07,439 --> 03:13:10,879
There may be some talk, but I'll make sure
that people hear about Dr Baker.'

3927
03:13:12,160 --> 03:13:14,160
'Thank you very much,' Maxim said.

3928
03:13:15,200 --> 03:13:18,559
'What a dreadful thing illness is,' Colonel
Julyan went on.

3929
03:13:19,359 --> 03:13:21,040
'I suppose she could not face the pain.

3930
03:13:21,840 --> 03:13:23,760
She was such a lovely young woman, too.'

3931
03:13:25,120 --> 03:13:26,319
Neither of us answered him.

3932
03:13:27,439 --> 03:13:31,599
Colonel Julyan's sister lived in London and
he asked Maxim to take him to her house.

3933
03:13:32,960 --> 03:13:37,200
'We must thank you for all your help,' Maxim
said as the magistrate got out of the car.

3934
03:13:38,080 --> 03:13:39,200
'I've been glad to help.

3935
03:13:39,760 --> 03:13:40,960
You must forget it all now.

3936
03:13:41,600 --> 03:13:44,000
Why don't you have a holiday, go abroad perhaps.

3937
03:13:44,720 --> 03:13:46,000
Goodbye, both of you.

3938
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:46,960
It's been a long day.'

3939
03:13:48,720 --> 03:13:53,120
As Maxim started up the car, I leant back
in my seat and closed my eyes.

3940
03:13:54,000 --> 03:13:56,640
We drove on through the traffic and I felt
full of peace.

3941
03:13:57,600 --> 03:13:59,121
Nothing could hurt us any more.

3942
03:14:00,399 --> 03:14:03,439
We had dinner in a restaurant and Maxim phoned
Frank.

3943
03:14:05,040 --> 03:14:08,239
'Do you think Colonel Julyan knows the truth
about Rebecca's death?'

3944
03:14:08,239 --> 03:14:10,319
I asked Maxim as we were drinking our coffee.

3945
03:14:11,359 --> 03:14:13,359
'Of course he knows,' Maxim said.

3946
03:14:14,080 --> 03:14:15,439
'But he will never say anything.

3947
03:14:16,479 --> 03:14:18,399
I believe that Rebecca lied to me on purpose.

3948
03:14:19,200 --> 03:14:20,399
She wanted me to kill her.

3949
03:14:21,120 --> 03:14:22,239
That's why she laughed.

3950
03:14:23,040 --> 03:14:24,640
She was laughing when she died.'

3951
03:14:26,160 --> 03:14:27,359
I did not say anything.

3952
03:14:28,160 --> 03:14:29,040
It was all over.

3953
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:32,560
There was no need for Maxim to look so white
and troubled.

3954
03:14:33,840 --> 03:14:37,840
'I'm not sure that Rebecca hasn't won, even
now,' Maxim went on.

3955
03:14:38,560 --> 03:14:40,960
'Frank told me something rather strange on
the phone.

3956
03:14:41,840 --> 03:14:43,680
Mrs Danvers has left Manderley.

3957
03:14:44,399 --> 03:14:46,799
There was a long-distance call for her at
six.

3958
03:14:47,520 --> 03:14:49,360
By a quarter to seven, she had gone.'

3959
03:14:50,800 --> 03:14:52,239
'Isn't that a good thing?'

3960
03:14:52,239 --> 03:14:52,739
I said.

3961
03:14:53,520 --> 03:14:55,359
'Favell phoned her, of course.

3962
03:14:55,359 --> 03:14:56,960
But they can't do anything to us.'

3963
03:14:58,640 --> 03:15:00,480
I was glad that Mrs Danvers had gone.

3964
03:15:01,279 --> 03:15:02,559
Manderley could be ours.

3965
03:15:03,600 --> 03:15:04,880
We would have people to stay.

3966
03:15:05,439 --> 03:15:08,239
And soon, very soon Maxim and I would have
children.

3967
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:10,640
'Have you finished your coffee?'

3968
03:15:11,200 --> 03:15:12,479
Maxim said to me suddenly.

3969
03:15:13,359 --> 03:15:15,839
'I feel that we must get back to Manderley
as soon as possible.

3970
03:15:16,640 --> 03:15:18,400
Something's wrong, I know it is.'

3971
03:15:19,600 --> 03:15:21,520
'But you'll be so tired,' I said.

3972
03:15:22,239 --> 03:15:23,679
'No, I shall be all right.

3973
03:15:23,680 --> 03:15:25,360
We can be at Manderley by two o'clock.'

3974
03:15:27,120 --> 03:15:29,680
We went out to the car and Maxim covered me
with a rug.

3975
03:15:30,640 --> 03:15:33,840
It was dark now and I fell asleep almost at
once.

3976
03:15:34,399 --> 03:15:35,359
I started to dream.

3977
03:15:36,479 --> 03:15:41,519
I saw the staircase at Manderley and Mrs Danvers
standing there in her long, black dress.

3978
03:15:42,800 --> 03:15:46,400
Then, in my dream, I was alone in the woods
near Manderley.

3979
03:15:47,439 --> 03:15:50,319
I wanted to get to the Happy Valley, but I
could not find it.

3980
03:15:51,120 --> 03:15:52,800
The dark trees were all round me.

3981
03:15:53,840 --> 03:15:55,680
Then I was standing on the terrace.

3982
03:15:55,680 --> 03:15:57,120
Moonlight shone on the windows.

3983
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:01,840
The gardens had gone and the dark woods came
up to the walls of the house.

3984
03:16:03,040 --> 03:16:04,160
I woke up suddenly.

3985
03:16:05,600 --> 03:16:08,479
'You've slept for two hours,' Maxim told me.

3986
03:16:08,479 --> 03:16:09,519
'It's quarter past two.

3987
03:16:10,239 --> 03:16:11,279
We shall be home by three.'

3988
03:16:13,359 --> 03:16:14,880
The early morning was very cold.

3989
03:16:15,439 --> 03:16:17,679
The sky was dark now and there were no stars.

3990
03:16:19,120 --> 03:16:20,800
'What time did you say it was?'

3991
03:16:20,800 --> 03:16:21,600
I said suddenly.

3992
03:16:22,479 --> 03:16:24,959
'It's twenty past two,' Maxim replied.

3993
03:16:25,920 --> 03:16:27,760
'That's strange,' I said.

3994
03:16:28,560 --> 03:16:31,600
'The dawn seems to be coming up over there,
behind those hills.

3995
03:16:32,399 --> 03:16:34,479
But it can't be, it's too early.'

3996
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:39,201
'It's the wrong direction, too,' Maxim said
'you're looking west.'

3997
03:16:40,720 --> 03:16:42,160
I went on watching the sky.

3998
03:16:42,880 --> 03:16:44,160
It was still getting lighter.

3999
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:47,519
A blood-red light was spreading across the
sky.

4000
03:16:48,560 --> 03:16:51,360
Maxim began to drive faster, much faster.

4001
03:16:52,479 --> 03:16:55,519
'That's not the dawn,' he 
said, 'that's Manderley.'

4002
03:16:57,439 --> 03:16:58,719
We reached the top of the hill.

4003
03:16:59,439 --> 03:17:01,519
The road to Manderley lay before us.

4004
03:17:02,560 --> 03:17:05,360
There was no moon and the sky above our heads
was black.

4005
03:17:06,399 --> 03:17:09,200
But the sky in front of us was full of dreadful
light.

4006
03:17:10,239 --> 03:17:13,200
And the light was red, red like blood.

4007
03:17:14,560 --> 03:17:16,560
The wind blew towards us from the sea.

4008
03:17:17,840 --> 03:17:21,600
The wind smelt of smoke and it was grey with
ashes.

4009
03:17:23,120 --> 03:17:25,840
They were the ashes of Manderley.
