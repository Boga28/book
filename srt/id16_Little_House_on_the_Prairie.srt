00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:14,419
CHAPTER ONE
The Ingalls family goes West

2
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:24,470
A 

3
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:32,390
long time ago, Pa and Ma and Mary and Laura
and Baby Carrie left their little house in

4
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,390
Wisconsin.

5
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,630
They drove away and left it lonely and empty
among the big trees, and they never saw that

6
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,370
little house again.

7
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,620
They were going to Indian country.

8
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,350
Pa said there were too many people in Wisconsin
now.

9
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,460
Wild animals did not stay in a country where
there were so many people, so Pa didn't want

10
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,220
to stay.

11
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,580
He liked a country where the animals lived
without fear.

12
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:12,250
He liked to see them looking at him in the
forest and eating fruit from the trees.

13
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,530
In the long winter evenings Pa talked to Ma
about the Western country.

14
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,979
'Let's go see the West,' he said.

15
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:26,170
'The land is flat and the grass grows thick
and high.

16
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,450
Animals run freely and there are no settlers.

17
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,850
Only Indians live there.'

18
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,859
'Oh, Charles, must we go now?'

19
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:36,200
Ma said.

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,490
'The weather's so cold and our warm house
is so comfortable.'

21
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,869
'If we are going this year, we must go now,'
said Pa.

22
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,249
'We can't cross the Mississippi River after
the ice breaks.'

23
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:54,359
So Pa sold the little house in Wisconsin.

24
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,880
With Ma's help, he made a canvas cover for
their wagon.

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,570
They put everything into the wagon except
their beds and tables and chairs.

26
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,000
Pa could make new ones out West.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,390
The next morning when it was still dark, Ma
gently shook Mary and Laura until they got

28
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,390
up.

29
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,970
By the light of the fire she helped them dress
warmly.

30
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,220
They put on warm dresses and heavy coats.

31
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:35,840
Grandmother, Grandfather, aunts, and uncles
were all there to say good-bye to them.

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,530
Pa put his gun inside the wagon where he could
reach it quickly.

33
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,930
He put his fiddle between two blankets in
order to keep it safe.

34
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:54,550
Their dog Jack went under the wagon, and they
drove away.

35
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:01,280
'When we get to the West,' Pa said to Laura,
'you'll see a papoose.'

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,830
'What's a papoose?'

37
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,930
she asked.

38
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,080
'A papoose is a little brown Indian baby,'
Pa explained.

39
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,070
It was a long, long way to Indian country.

40
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:25,260
Almost every day the horses travelled as far
as they could; almost every night Pa and Ma

41
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,770
stopped in a new place.

42
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:34,370
They rode across the wide Mississippi River
before the ice broke, and crossed many other

43
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,650
rivers and creeks.

44
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:45,660
One day Pa sold the tired brown horses and
got two small young black horses with soft

45
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,790
gentle eyes and long tails.

46
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,560
'They're western horses,' Pa said.

47
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,180
'Very strong but very gentle.'

48
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,060
When Laura asked what their names were, Pa
said that she and Mary could choose names

49
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,420
for the horses.

50
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:10,840
So they called one 'Pet' and the other 'Patty'.

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,950
They had travelled across Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Iowa, and Missouri.

52
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:24,819
All that long way, their little dog Jack had
walked along under the wagon.

53
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:29,860
Pa sat up front, holding the reins.

54
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,840
Ma sat next to him, straight and quiet.

55
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,520
Baby Carrie slept in soft blankets in the
back.

56
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,629
Now they were crossing Kansas, an endless
flat land covered with tall grass.

57
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:54,100
Day after day they saw nothing but grass and
a big sky.

58
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,759
There was nothing new to do and nothing new
to look at.

59
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,699
'Ma, can't we get out and run behind the wagon?'

60
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:03,910
Laura said.

61
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,940
'My legs are so tired.'

62
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,360
'No, Laura,' Ma said.

63
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,580
'I'm hungry.

64
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,389
I want to camp now!'

65
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:19,039
Then Ma said, 'Laura.'

66
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,509
That was all she said, but Laura understood
that she should stay quiet.

67
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:30,080
'We're coming to a creek or river,' Pa said.

68
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,960
'Girls, can you see those trees?

69
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,129
That's where we'll camp tonight.'

70
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:42,280
Suddenly the road went down and they arrived
at the creek.

71
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,719
Pet and Patty stopped to drink.

72
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:51,060
The sound of fast-running water tilled the
still air.

73
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,759
The river was silver and blue and the water
ran quickly in the middle.

74
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,159
'The creek's really high,' Pa said.

75
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,610
'But I guess we can cross It.'

76
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,770
Pa looked at Ma.

77
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,479
'What do you say, Caroline?'

78
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,189
'Yes, Charles,' Ma answered.

79
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:10,689
'I think we can.'

80
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:18,059
So the wagon went forward.

81
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:20,949
Soon the wheels were in deep water.

82
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:26,639
'The horses may have to swim out there in
the middle,' Pa said.

83
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,659
'But we'll get across all right, Caroline.'

84
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:36,110
Laura thought of Jack and said, 'I wish Jack
could ride in the wagon, Pa.'

85
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,620
Pa did not answer.

86
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,150
He was busy with the horses, pulling their
reins.

87
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,580
Ma said, 'Jack can swim, Laura.

88
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,580
He'll be fine.'

89
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:58,999
Then suddenly the wagon lifted and rocked,
and Laura knew they were in the creek.

90
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,650
Mary hid under the blankets.

91
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,320
She was afraid of the water.

92
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,409
But Laura was excited.

93
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:11,379
Ma said loudly, 'Lie down, girls!

94
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,050
Don't move!'

95
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,600
Mary and Laura dropped flat on the bed.

96
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,139
When Ma spoke like that, they obeyed her.

97
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:26,190
Ma's arm pulled a blanket over them, heads
and all.

98
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,190
Laura felt the wagon turning.

99
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:32,159
The water made so much noise.

100
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:35,449
Then Pa's voice frightened Laura.

101
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:40,150
'Take the horses, Caroline!' he said.

102
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,539
Suddenly Pa was gone.

103
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:49,180
Ma sat alone, holding the reins with both
hands.

104
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:56,939
Mary hid her face in the blankets again, but
Laura sat up and looked out.

105
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:06,369
She couldn't see anything but water everywhere
and three heads in the water - Pet's head,

106
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:12,069
Patty's head, and Pa's small wet head.

107
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:18,199
Pa's hand was holding Pet's head and he was
talking calmly to the horses.

108
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,610
Ma's face was white and frightened.

109
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,389
Mary was crying and Laura felt cold and sick.

110
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:37,120
She closed her eyes, but she could still see
the terrible water with Pa in it.

111
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,349
For a long time the wagon rocked in the water.

112
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:48,630
Finally the front wheels hit the ground and
Pa shouted.

113
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:55,459
Laura saw the wet horses climbing out of the
water.

114
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:58,949
Pa was running beside them, shouting 'Get
up!

115
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:00,620
Get up!

116
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,660
Good girls!'

117
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:10,709
And then the horses and the wagon stood still,
safely out of that creek.

118
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:13,540
Pa was wet and tired.

119
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,090
'Oh, Charles!'

120
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,640
Ma cried.

121
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,530
'Calm down, Caroline,' said Pa.

122
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,860
'We're all safe.

123
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,759
All's well that ends well.'

124
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,399
But Laura was still frightened.

125
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,420
She knew they were lucky to be alive.

126
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,740
Suddenly she shouted, 'Oh, where's Jack?'

127
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:44,839
They had forgotten Jack and could not see
him anywhere.

128
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:50,250
Pa walked up and down the creek looking everywhere
for him.

129
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,120
But Jack was gone.

130
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,360
There was nothing to do but go on.

131
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,810
Laura tried not to cry.

132
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:10,410
She looked back all the way but she saw nothing
except hills and trees.

133
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,310
Soon Pa stopped the horses.

134
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,410
He was ready to camp.

135
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,399
Mary and Laura climbed to the ground, too.

136
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,440
Pa seemed sad.

137
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,520
He did not sing while he worked as he usually
did.

138
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:35,480
'I don't know what we'll do in a wild country
without a good dog,' he said.

139
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,370
Pa made a fire and brought water from the
creek.

140
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:47,009
Mary and Laura helped Ma make a supper of
salted pork, cornbread, and coffee.

141
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:53,590
As they ate, purple shadows closed around
the campfire.

142
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:58,199
The wide prairie was dark and still.

143
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:05,819
Then Laura heard a long, frightening cry from
the dark prairie.

144
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:11,100
'Wolves,' Pa said.

145
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,660
'I wish Jack was still with us.'

146
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,529
Laura felt like crying, but she knew she must
be strong.

147
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:25,130
Suddenly she jumped up.

148
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,149
She had seen something.

149
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:32,500
Two green lights were shining, deep in the
dark.

150
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,899
They were eyes.

151
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,300
'Look, Pa, look!'

152
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,300
Laura said.

153
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,120
A wolf!'

154
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,380
Pa moved quickly.

155
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:49,360
He took his gun from the wagon and was ready
to shoot at those green eyes.

156
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,629
Pa threw some wood at the animal.

157
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,949
The green eyes went close to the ground.

158
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,910
Pa held the gun ready.

159
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,199
The animal did not move.

160
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:06,889
'Don't shoot, Charles,' Ma said.

161
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:11,519
But Pa walked slowly toward those eyes.

162
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,580
And slowly along the ground the eyes moved
toward him.

163
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,240
And then Laura saw a little brown animal.

164
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,170
She screamed and Pa shouted.

165
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:34,129
The next thing she knew, a happy, jumping
Jack was on top of her.

166
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:39,170
Her face and hands were wet from his warm
wet tongue.

167
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,860
He jumped from Pa to Ma and back to her again.

168
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:50,020
Then he lay down close to Laura and slept.

169
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:57,990
When Laura went to bed that night, she looked
at the large, shining stars in the sky.

170
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,620
Pa could reach them, she thought.

171
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,050
Suddenly she was very surprised.

172
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,470
The largest star smiled at her!

173
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,640
Then she was waking up the next morning.

174
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:37,829
CHAPTER TWO
Pa builds the little house

175
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:44,579
It was still dark, and Pa was packing everything
into the wagon.

176
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:49,500
Mary and Laura ate their breakfast in a hurry.

177
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,920
When the sun came up, they were driving across
the prairie again.

178
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,139
There was no road now.

179
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:03,579
So Pet and Patty walked through the tall grass.

180
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:07,459
Before noon, Pa stopped the wagon.

181
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:11,100
'Here we are, Caroline!' he said.

182
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,820
'We'll build our house right here.'

183
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,310
Laura and Mary jumped out.

184
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:26,790
There was nothing around them but grass that
reached to the edge of the sky.

185
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,389
Nearby was a creek.

186
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:36,629
It lay below the prairie, but they could see
the dark green tree-tops.

187
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:42,050
Far away another line of different greens
lay across the prairie.

188
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:48,709
'That's the Verdigris River,' Pa said to Ma.

189
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:55,050
Then Pa and Ma took everything out of the
wagon and put it on the ground.

190
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:02,660
They took the canvas off the wagon and covered
all their things.

191
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,180
Then Pa took his axe and drove away.

192
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,819
'Where's Pa going?'

193
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:10,819
Laura asked.

194
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:17,149
'To get logs from the creek for our house,'
Ma said.

195
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:24,579
It was strange and frightening to be without
the wagon on the High Prairie.

196
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:31,839
The land and the sky seemed too large, and
Laura felt small.

197
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,980
She wanted to hide in the tall grass like
a prairie chicken.

198
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,639
But she didn't.

199
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,430
First she helped Ma make the beds under the
canvas cover.

200
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:50,329
Then she went for a walk.

201
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:57,600
She found a mysterious little path in the
grass, and she followed it slowly.

202
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:05,120
But suddenly she felt afraid and hurried back
to Ma.

203
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,800
When Pa returned with the logs, Laura told
him about the path.

204
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,130
'I saw it earlier,' he said.

205
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,060
'It's an old trail, I guess.'

206
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,319
'When will I see a papoose?'

207
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:20,399
she asked.

208
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,170
'I don't know, Laura,' Pa replied.

209
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,980
'You only see Indians when they want you to
see them.'

210
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:34,430
Day after day Pa drove to the creek.

211
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:41,300
When he had enough logs, he measured the shape
of the house on the ground by walking from

212
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,279
side to side and front to back.

213
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:55,160
He dug shallow trenches along two sides and
rolled two big logs into them.

214
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,350
Then he put two strong logs across the first
two to make a square.

215
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:08,670
With his axe he made a deep wide cut near
the end of each log.

216
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:14,740
The four logs fit together at these cuts.

217
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:21,430
These four strong logs could hold up the new
house.

218
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:27,360
All by himself Pa built the house three logs
high.

219
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,020
Then Ma helped him.

220
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:38,450
Log by log, they built the walls higher while
Laura played in the tall grass.

221
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,400
One day she heard Pa shout, 'Caroline, be
careful!

222
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,280
Get out of the way!'

223
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,330
A big log was falling towards Ma.

224
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,960
Pa couldn't stop it.

225
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,830
It crashed down, and Ma fell to the ground.

226
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,300
Laura and Pa ran to Ma.

227
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,150
The log was on her foot.

228
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:11,580
Pa lifted it and Ma pulled out her foot.

229
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,300
Pa felt her leg; nothing was broken.

230
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,140
'Can you move your arms?' he asked.

231
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,750
'Can you turn your head?'

232
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,750
Ma moved her arms and turned her head.

233
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:31,049
'I'm all right,' she whispered.

234
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:35,030
'Thank God,' Pa said.

235
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,080
'Nothing's broken.

236
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,330
It's only a bad sprain.'

237
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:47,360
Ma's face was gray but she said bravely, 'Well,
a sprain will soon get better.

238
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,040
Don't worry, Charles.'

239
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,840
But Ma's foot didn't get better for some time.

240
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,460
'The house must wait,' said Pa.

241
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:12,630
Then one afternoon, Pa came up the creek road
singing.

242
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,190
'Good news!' he shouted.

243
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,039
'We have a neighbour only three kilometers
away on the other side of the creek.

244
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:24,010
I met him while I was hunting.

245
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:30,600
He's going to help me finish our house, and
then I'll go over and help him with his house.'

246
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,760
Early the next morning Mr Edwards arrived.

247
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:44,140
He was tall and wore old clothes, but he was
very polite to Ma.

248
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,610
And he was a fast worker.

249
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:53,270
In one day he and Pa finished the walls.

250
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:59,600
They laughed and sang while they worked, and
their axes made the wood fly.

251
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:08,630
They cut holes for a door and two windows,
and soon the house was finished except for

252
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,120
the roof and floor.

253
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,570
Laura ran inside the new house.

254
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:22,250
It smelled sweetly of cut wood and prairie
grass.

255
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:29,000
The sun shone through the window holes and
fell across Laura's hands and her arms and

256
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,309
her feet.

257
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:37,820
The walls were thick and the house felt large
and strong.

258
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:47,090
Ma had cooked a good supper and she and Pa
invited Mr Edwards to stay.

259
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:55,130
There was rabbit and hot cornbread with pork
and even coffee with real sugar.

260
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,180
Then Pa took out his fiddle.

261
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:08,160
Mr Edwards lay on the ground near the fire
to listen as Pa played Laura and Mary's favourite

262
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,530
song, 'I am a Gypsy King'.

263
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,960
Pa's voice was deeper than an old frog's.

264
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,059
Laura could not stop laughing.

265
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:29,300
Then Mr Edwards jumped up and began to dance
wildly in the moonlight.

266
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,270
Pa played song after song while Mr Edwards
danced.

267
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:43,550
Laura's and Mary's hands were clapping and
their feet were moving with the music, too.

268
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:52,340
And Baby Carrie, who had woken up, was sitting
in Ma's arms, clapping her little hands and

269
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,340
laughing.

270
00:21:53,340 --> 00:22:03,909
When it was time for Mr Edwards to go, he
took his gun and said good night.

271
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:12,640
Pa played one last song as Mr Edwards walked
away into the darkness, singing happily.

272
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,750
When the song ended, the prairie was silent.

273
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:26,372
Only the wind whispered in the tall grass.

274
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:30,399
'The walls are up,' Pa said to Ma the next
morning.

275
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:32,490
'Let's move in.

276
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,320
I heard wolves everywhere around us last night.

277
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,710
We should have strong thick walls around us.

278
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:45,020
I'll make the floor and roof later because
I must build a stable for Pet and Patty as

279
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,909
fast as I can.

280
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:50,020
They should be safe inside walls, too.'

281
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,870
'Why haven't we seen any Indians?'

282
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,920
Ma asked.

283
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,450
'I don't know,' Pa replied.

284
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,880
'I've seen the places where they camp.

285
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,600
They're away hunting for food now, I guess.'

286
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:14,450
After breakfast Pa got on top of the walls
to put the canvas wagon cover over the house.

287
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:20,789
The canvas blew wildly in the wind, and so
did Pa's hair.

288
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:25,850
Once he almost flew away into the air like
a big bird.

289
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,890
But he finally tied the canvas down.

290
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,770
By dinner time, the house was ready.

291
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,650
The beds were made on the floor.

292
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,350
Short logs had become chairs.

293
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,410
Pa's gun was up in its place over the door.

294
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,419
It was a pleasant house.

295
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:57,260
'Before winter comes I'll make a wood floor
and a solid roof,' Pa said.

296
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,690
'But that must wait until I finish helping
Mr Edwards and building a stable.

297
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,419
We're going to do well here, Caroline.

298
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:09,240
We'll be happy here for the rest of our lives.'

299
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,850
Laura liked this place, too.

300
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:20,950
She liked the great big sky, the winds, and
the wide land.

301
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:26,050
Everything was so clean and big and wonderful.

302
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:35,860
Inside the thick walls of their new home they
felt warm and safe.

303
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,419
Pa put up a quilt over the door hole.

304
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:47,880
As she fell asleep that night, Laura heard
a wolf's cry from somewhere far away on the

305
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,980
prairie.

306
00:24:52,980 --> 00:25:13,549
She did not feel so frightened.

307
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:37,370
CHAPTER THREE
Wolves frighten the family

308
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:44,330
Pa and Mr Edwards built the stable for Pet
and Patty in one day.

309
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,529
By the time they put the roof on, it was dark.

310
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:52,630
'Now!' said Pa.

311
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,429
'Let those wolves howl!

312
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:57,160
I'll sleep tonight.'

313
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:04,870
In the morning when Laura went into the stable,
she found a surprise waiting for her.

314
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:10,600
A little colt with long ears stood beside
Pet!

315
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:17,539
When Laura ran toward it, gentle Pet put back
her ears and showed her teeth.

316
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:20,519
'Stay back, Laura!'

317
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,750
Pa shouted.

318
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,980
'She could bite you.'

319
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:30,830
Then he said to Pet, 'You know we won't hurt
your baby, Pet.'

320
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:39,730
Pet let Pa touch the baby, but she didn't
let Laura or Mary go near her.

321
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:48,710
Early that afternoon, Pa rode Patty across
the prairie to see what he could see.

322
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:55,779
There was plenty of meat in the house, so
he did not take his gun.

323
00:26:55,779 --> 00:27:00,940
By late afternoon, he still had not come home.

324
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:08,480
Ma and Laura began to get supper ready outside
by the fire.

325
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:16,870
Mary was in the house, taking care of the
baby, and Laura asked Ma, 'What's the matter

326
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,159
with Jack?'

327
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,210
Jack was walking up and down and around the
house, looking worried.

328
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,919
His hair stood up on his neck.

329
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,710
Then Pet started running around in circles.

330
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:42,080
Ma looked around at the wide prairie and the
sky but didn't see anything unusual.

331
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,040
'It's probably nothing at all, Laura,' Ma
said.

332
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,529
She made the coffee.

333
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:54,520
The prairie chicken that was cooking on the
fire began to smell good.

334
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:00,620
But all the time Ma went on looking around.

335
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:06,549
Suddenly Patty came running fast across the
prairie.

336
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:11,570
Pa was almost flat, holding onto her neck.

337
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,159
Patty ran past the stable before Pa could
stop her.

338
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,919
She was trembling, and her black coat was
hot and wet.

339
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,279
Pa was hot and tired, too.

340
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,580
'What's the matter, Charles?'

341
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,059
Ma asked him.

342
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:36,710
Pa's eyes were looking toward the creek, so
Ma and Laura looked at it, too.

343
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,370
But they only saw grass and trees.

344
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,309
'What is it?'

345
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:44,600
Ma asked again.

346
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,149
'Why were you riding Patty so fast?'

347
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:50,470
'I was afraid the wolves had come here.'

348
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,960
'Wolves!'

349
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,940
Ma cried.

350
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,929
'What wolves?'

351
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:01,040
'Everything's fine now, Caroline,' said Pa.

352
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,440
'Let me rest a minute.'

353
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,460
Then he said, 'We saw fifty of them, Caroline.

354
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,700
They were the biggest wolves I've ever seen.

355
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
It was terrible.'

356
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,169
Supper was ready.

357
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:23,149
Mary and Laura stayed close to the fire and
kept Baby Carrie with them.

358
00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:29,360
They could feel the darkness everywhere, and
they didn't stop looking around.

359
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,240
Shadows moved on the prairie.

360
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:40,820
Jack did not growl, but his ears were lifted,
listening to the darkness.

361
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:49,460
The girls ate their chicken as they listened
to Pa telling Ma about the wolves.

362
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,340
He had found some more neighbours.

363
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:59,580
Settlers were coming in and building houses
along both sides of the creek.

364
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:05,200
Not far away, a man and his wife were building
a house.

365
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:12,010
Their name was Scott, and Pa said they were
nice people.

366
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:20,000
As he was riding home across the prairie,
a pack of wolves came out of nowhere.

367
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,919
They were all around Pa in a moment.

368
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,840
'It was a big pack,' Pa said.

369
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,960
'There were fifty wolves, and the biggest
wolves I ever saw in my life.

370
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,450
Their leader was a meter tall.

371
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,240
I tell you, my hair stood straight up.'

372
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,470
'And you didn't have your gun,' said Ma.

373
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,200
'I know.

374
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,960
But to be honest, I didn't miss it.

375
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,530
You can't fight fifty wolves with one gun.'

376
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:55,000
'What did you do?'

377
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,410
Ma asked.

378
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:00,640
'Nothing,' said Pa.

379
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,840
'Patty tried to run, but I pulled the reins
hard and made her walk.

380
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,350
Wolves will chase and hurt a running horse.'

381
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,029
'How awful, Charles!'

382
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:13,720
Ma said quietly.

383
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,190
'Yes, it was,' said Pa.

384
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:25,039
'Those wolves just walked along with us, like
a pack of dogs going along with a horse.

385
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,009
They were all around us, jumping and playing
with each other, just like dogs.

386
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:33,919
We were lucky they weren't hungry.'

387
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,149
Laura's mouth and eyes were wide open.

388
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:41,940
Her heart was beating fast.

389
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,340
'Patty was trembling all over,' Pa said.

390
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,299
'She was so scared.

391
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:48,769
I was, too.

392
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:51,539
But I made her walk.

393
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:56,460
When we got near the creek, the leader turned
down toward the creek, and the rest of the

394
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,460
pack followed him.

395
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,340
That's when I let Patty go.

396
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,970
I was scared the whole way home.

397
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,790
I thought the wolves might come this way.

398
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:10,120
I knew you could keep the wolves out of the
house with the gun.

399
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,080
But Pet and her colt were outside.'

400
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,669
'I guess I could save our horses, Charles,'
Ma said.

401
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:21,700
'I know,' said Pa.

402
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,789
'I wasn't thinking straight.

403
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:30,779
But the wolves are far from here by now, and
all's well that ends well.'

404
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:34,019
Jack was walking around the campfire.

405
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:40,840
When he stopped to smell the air, the hair
lifted on his neck.

406
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,539
'It's time for bed, girls!'

407
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:45,340
Ma said.

408
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,240
She took them all into the house.

409
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,580
But it took Laura a long time to fall asleep.

410
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,820
Suddenly she was sitting straight up in bed.

411
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,070
She had been asleep.

412
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:09,220
Light from the moon was coming through the
window and the cracks in the wall.

413
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,240
Pa was standing there with his gun.

414
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:20,260
Suddenly, a wolf howled right in Laura's ear.

415
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,419
She pulled away from the wall.

416
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:28,169
The wolf was just on the other side of it.

417
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:32,090
Laura was too scared to speak.

418
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:39,620
Then many wolves started howling all around
the house, and Laura got out of bed.

419
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,660
Pa turned his head and saw her standing there.

420
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:50,870
'Do you want to see them, Laura?' he asked,
softly.

421
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:55,799
Without saying anything, Laura walked over
to Pa.

422
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,220
He put down his gun and lifted her up to the
window.

423
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:07,419
There in the light of the moon sat a half
circle of wolves.

424
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:13,480
They looked at Laura, and she looked at them.

425
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,650
The biggest one was taller than Laura.

426
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:24,220
His coat was gray and his eyes were shining
and green.

427
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,399
Laura looked and looked at that wolf.

428
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:34,429
'He's awfully big,' Laura said into Pa's ear.

429
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,940
'Yes, and see how his coat shines,' Pa said
into her hair.

430
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,329
'They're in a circle around the house.'

431
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:47,370
Laura went with him to the other window.

432
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:52,520
There she saw the other half of the circle
of wolves.

433
00:34:52,520 --> 00:35:01,710
The big wolf lifted his nose to the sky and
howled.

434
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,160
All the other wolves answered him.

435
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:10,140
The noise filled the wide prairie.

436
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,599
'Now go back to bed, Laura,' Pa said.

437
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,660
'Go to sleep.

438
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,869
Jack and I will take care of you all.'

439
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:22,410
So Laura went back to bed.

440
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:27,420
She heard the wolves howling and trying to
smell them through the cracks in the walls

441
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,230
of the house.

442
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:56,150
It was a long time before she fell asleep.

443
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:19,800
CHAPTER FOUR
Pa finishes the house

444
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:26,530
When Laura woke up the next morning, the warm
sun was on her face.

445
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,880
She ran outdoors.

446
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,460
Mary was talking to Ma by the fire.

447
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,730
There were no wolves anywhere.

448
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:41,270
Pa came up the creek road with his gun in
hand.

449
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:46,010
He had made sure that the wolves were gone.

450
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:50,020
They all sat by the fire and ate their breakfast.

451
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:54,580
'I'll make a door today,' Pa said.

452
00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:00,630
'I want more than a quilt between us and the
wolves next time.'

453
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:09,040
After breakfast, Pa took the horses and his
axe and went to get wood for the door.

454
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,380
Mary watched, but Laura helped Pa to make
the door.

455
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:20,579
She gave him his saw, which he used to cut
the logs at the ends.

456
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:25,250
With his axe he made nice straight boards
from the logs.

457
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:32,650
He laid the long boards on the ground and
fastened some shorter boards across them.

458
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,369
That made the door.

459
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:44,250
Then Pa made a door frame and put hinges on
the door to make it open and close.

460
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:51,940
While he put the door in place, Laura stood
against it to hold it up, and Pa fastened

461
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,030
the hinges to the frame.

462
00:37:54,030 --> 00:38:01,300
When the door was finished, it was beautiful
and strong.

463
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:06,130
'Now we're all safe!' said Pa.

464
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:10,010
'And I had a fine little helper!'

465
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:14,260
He put his hand gently on Laura's head.

466
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:23,250
The sun was going down, the wind was cooler,
and supper was cooking on the fire.

467
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:32,200
It was salt pork, which made the best supper
smells that Laura had ever smelled.

468
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:40,170
That night Pa said to Ma, 'Now, Caroline,
I'm going to build you a fireplace.

469
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,980
Then you can do your cooking inside the house.

470
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:49,140
I've never seen such a sunny place as this,
but I suppose that one of these days the rains

471
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,569
will come.'

472
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:53,960
'Yes, Charles,' Ma said.

473
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,339
'Good weather always comes to an end, sooner
or later.'

474
00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:05,980
And so Pa was soon cutting away the grass
just outside the wall of the house where he

475
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,950
was going to build the fireplace.

476
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:13,520
Then he climbed into the wagon.

477
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,990
He looked down at Laura; she was looking up
at him.

478
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,630
'Do you want to go along, Laura?

479
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,490
You and Mary?'

480
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,680
Ma said that they could.

481
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,030
The girls climbed up and sat on the high seat
beside Pa.

482
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:37,650
Pet and Patty started with a little jump and
pulled the wagon down the new road that Pa's

483
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,370
wagon wheels had begun to make.

484
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:47,810
They rode through dry valleys and over low,
round hills.

485
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:54,750
Forests covered some of these hills, but some
of them were open and grassy.

486
00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:02,521
Deer were lying under the trees or standing
and eating grass in the sun.

487
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:08,040
They lifted their heads and watched the wagon
with their large, soft eyes.

488
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:14,819
Birds sang and rabbits jumped out of the way
of the wagon.

489
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:20,849
When they arrived at the creek, Pa said, 'You
girls can play, but don't go too far into

490
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:22,130
the water.'

491
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:30,520
So Laura and Mary played by the creek while
Pa dug the big rocks that he needed for the

492
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,520
fireplace.

493
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:38,890
When the wagon was full, they rode home to
the High Prairie, where the wind was blowing

494
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,660
and the grass was singing.

495
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,559
Laura decided she liked the High Prairie best.

496
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:52,339
It was so wide and sweet and clean.

497
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:57,290
That afternoon, the family watched Pa build
the fireplace.

498
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:03,890
First, he had cleared grass in a square outside
the house wall.

499
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:10,430
Now he put a row of rocks around the square.

500
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:16,559
Next he mixed earth and water to a beautiful,
thick mud.

501
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,329
He put some mud over the rocks.

502
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:24,619
In the mud he put another row of rocks.

503
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:31,570
With rocks and mud and more rocks and more
mud, Pa built the fireplace and chimney as

504
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:35,630
high as the house wall.

505
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:41,330
Then he used wood and mud to finish the top
of the chimney.

506
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:49,410
Finally he went into the house, and with his
axe and saw he cut a hole in the wall.

507
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,720
And there was the fireplace!

508
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,730
The whole family stood and admired it.

509
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:05,210
Ma carefully built a little fire in the new
fireplace and cooked a prairie chicken for

510
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,920
supper.

511
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,062
And that evening they ate in their house.

512
00:42:09,062 --> 00:42:15,589
The chicken tasted so good in Laura's mouth.

513
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:20,890
Her hands and face were washed and her hair
was brushed.

514
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:27,970
She sat up straight on her log chair and used
her knife and fork nicely, as Ma had taught

515
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,000
her.

516
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,270
She did not say anything, because children
must not speak at the table until they are

517
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:46,690
spoken to, but she looked at Pa and Ma and
Mary and Baby Carrie, and she felt happy.

518
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,230
It was nice to be in a house again.

519
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:58,190
All day long, every day, Laura and Mary were
busy.

520
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:04,309
When the dishes were washed and the beds were
made, there was always plenty to do and to

521
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:06,530
see.

522
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:13,140
In the tall grass, they looked for birds and
watched baby prairie chickens running to their

523
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,339
mothers.

524
00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:23,410
They watched snakes lying still in the sun
or moving fast through the prairie.

525
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:31,150
All the time, of course, either Laura or Mary
was taking care of Baby Carrie.

526
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:36,740
Sometimes Laura forgot to be quiet when Baby
Carrie was sleeping.

527
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:44,800
She ran around and shouted until Ma came to
the door and said, 'Laura, dear, must you

528
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,440
shout like an Indian?

529
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,559
In fact, you girls are getting as brown as
Indians in the sun!

530
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:54,690
Why can't you learn to keep your hats on?'

531
00:43:54,690 --> 00:44:00,250
'Pa, when are we going to see a papoose?'

532
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,750
Laura asked.

533
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:07,440
Pa was up on the house wall, beginning to
put on the roof.

534
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,090
'Why do you want to see an Indian baby?'

535
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:15,000
Ma said, surprised.

536
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,700
'Put on your hat and forget your crazy ideas.'

537
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,660
But Laura did not forget the papoose.

538
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:30,770
This was Indian country and she wanted to
see Indians.

539
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:38,290
She knew that she would see them sometime,
but she was tired of waiting.

540
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:43,250
Pa had taken the canvas off the top of the
house.

541
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:51,800
For days he had been carrying logs from the
creeks and cutting them into long, thin boards.

542
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,230
The boards were lying all around the house.

543
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:00,520
Now Pa reached down and pulled up a board.

544
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,059
He put it across the rafters.

545
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:08,470
Then he began to nail the board to the rafters.

546
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:15,720
Pa pulled up and nailed down more boards,
all the way to the top of the rafters.

547
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,800
The roof was done.

548
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,680
Rain would never get in.

549
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,849
Then Pa made a floor with beautiful hard wood.

550
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:32,790
'You've done a wonderful job, Charles,' Ma
said.

551
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:36,010
They were all happy that night.

552
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:38,300
The sky was full of stars.

553
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:47,839
Pa sat for a long time by the open door and
played his fiddle and sang to his family in

554
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,800
the house, and to the stars outside.

555
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:59,930
Later Pa dug a well with Mr Scott's help and
they didn't need to fetch muddy water from

556
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,530
the creek any more.

557
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:09,720
And after that he went to town to get glass
to put in the windows, and then the house

558
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:29,460
was truly finished.

559
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,400
CHAPTER FIVE
Indians

560
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:58,069
Early one morning Pa took his gun and went
hunting.

561
00:46:58,069 --> 00:46:59,569
Jack wanted to go.

562
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:02,900
too, but Pa tied him to the stable.

563
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,730
'No, Jack,' Pa said.

564
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:09,940
'You must stay here and take care of the family.'

565
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,920
Then he said to Mary and Laura, 'Don't untie
him, girls.'

566
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,310
Poor Jack lay down.

567
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:27,890
Mary and Laura stayed by the stable all morning
and tried to play with him, but he was miserable.

568
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:34,820
Jack's head was on Laura's leg and she was
talking to him when he suddenly stood up and

569
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,849
growled.

570
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:45,290
The hair on his neck stood straight up and
his eyes stared, red and angry.

571
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,730
Laura was afraid.

572
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:51,829
Jack had never growled at her before.

573
00:47:51,829 --> 00:48:00,480
Then she looked over her shoulder, where Jack
was looking, and she saw two wild men, one

574
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,130
behind the other coming closer on the Indian
trail.

575
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,400
'Mary!

576
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,680
Look!'

577
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,869
she shouted.

578
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:12,960
Mary looked and saw them, too.

579
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,240
They were tall, thin, fierce-looking men.

580
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,369
Their skin was reddish-brown.

581
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:25,030
Their eyes were black and shining.

582
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,599
There were feathers on their heads.

583
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:31,040
'Indians!'

584
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,040
Mary whispered.

585
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,049
Laura suddenly felt cold.

586
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:39,059
Her legs trembled.

587
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:42,069
Jack growled angrily.

588
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:46,250
The Indians came closer and closer.

589
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:52,309
Then Mary and Laura watched them walk right
into the house!

590
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:56,859
Jack was growling, jumping, and trying to
break free.

591
00:48:56,859 --> 00:49:01,400
'Jack's here,' Laura whispered to Mary.

592
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,589
'We'll be safe if we stay close to him.'

593
00:49:04,589 --> 00:49:08,790
'But they're in the house,' Mary whispered.

594
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:14,250
'They're in the house with Ma and Carrie!'

595
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,849
Then Laura began to shake all over.

596
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:20,570
She knew she must do something.

597
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:26,339
What were the Indians doing to Ma and Baby
Carrie?

598
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:28,799
There was no sound from the house.

599
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:33,380
'Oh, what are they doing to Ma?'

600
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,490
Laura screamed, in a whisper.

601
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,730
'Oh, I don't know!'

602
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,140
Mary whispered.

603
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,880
'I'm going to untie Jack,' Laura whispered
loudly.

604
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,030
'He'll kill them.'

605
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:51,150
'Pa told us not to do that,' Mary answered.

606
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:56,760
'He didn't know Indians would come,' Laura
said.

607
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:04,780
'He said not to untie Jack,' Mary was almost
crying.

608
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:11,799
Laura thought of little Baby Carrie and Ma,
there in the house with those Indians.

609
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:17,119
'I'm going in to help Ma!' she said.

610
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:22,910
She ran two steps and then turned and flew
back to Jack.

611
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,490
She hid her face against his neck.

612
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:33,369
'We mustn't leave Ma in there alone,' Mary
whispered.

613
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:37,660
She stood still and trembled.

614
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,890
Laura made herself leave Jack.

615
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:46,800
She shut her eyes and ran towards the house
as fast as she could.

616
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,960
She fell down and her eyes opened.

617
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,400
She got up again and started running.

618
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,650
Mary was right behind her.

619
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:00,390
They came to the door.

620
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:06,370
It was open, and they entered the house without
a sound.

621
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:12,099
The naked wild men stood by the fireplace.

622
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:20,440
Ma was cooking something over the fire while
Baby Carrie hid her face in Ma's dress.

623
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:28,250
Laura ran towards Ma, but as she reached the
Indians, she smelled something awful.

624
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:33,579
She looked up at the Indians and ran to hide
behind the table.

625
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:39,230
With one eye, she looked out at the wild men.

626
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:43,119
First, she saw the moccasins on their feet.

627
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:50,059
Then their thin, red-brown legs, all the way
up.

628
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:55,120
Around their waists each Indian wore the skin
of a small animal.

629
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:03,329
The skin was black and white, and now Laura
knew what had made that smell.

630
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:08,210
The skins were made from fresh skunks.

631
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:14,040
There was a knife and a small axe in each
skin.

632
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:19,700
Their faces were very calm and very fierce.

633
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:25,470
These wild men had no hair around their ears,
where hair usually grows.

634
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:34,900
There was hair only at the very top of their
heads, and they had put feathers in it.

635
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:40,631
When Laura looked out from behind the table,
both Indians were looking straight at her.

636
00:52:40,631 --> 00:52:44,480
Her heart jumped.

637
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,089
The Indians did not move.

638
00:52:48,089 --> 00:52:51,720
Only their eyes shone.

639
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,999
Laura did not move, either.

640
00:52:55,999 --> 00:53:01,940
Then the Indians made short sounds like 'Hah!'

641
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,240
Laura hid again behind the table.

642
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,809
She heard them sitting down on the floor.

643
00:53:08,809 --> 00:53:15,170
She heard Ma giving them cornbread and she
heard them eating it.

644
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:22,150
When Laura looked again, she saw they had
eaten every bit of the cornbread.

645
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,849
Then the Indians got up.

646
00:53:24,849 --> 00:53:32,579
They looked at Ma, made deep noises in their
throats, and walked out the door.

647
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:37,240
Their feet made no sound at all.

648
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,030
Ma sat down on the bed.

649
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:42,440
She looked sick.

650
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,130
She put her arms around Laura and Mary.

651
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:50,160
'Do you feel sick, Ma?'

652
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,730
Mary asked her.

653
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,970
'No.' said Ma.

654
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:00,809
'I'm just thankful they're gone.'

655
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:05,809
Soon Pa arrived home with a big rabbit and
two prairie chickens.

656
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:10,079
He put his gun up in its place over the door.

657
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:16,250
Laura and Mary threw their arms around him,
both talking at the same time.

658
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:19,270
'What's all this?' he said.

659
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:20,550
'Indians?

660
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:24,410
So you've seen Indians at last, have you,
Laura?

661
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:28,240
I noticed they have a camp in a valley west
of here.

662
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,130
Did Indians come into the house, Caroline?'

663
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:35,599
'Yes, Charles, two of them,' Ma said.

664
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:42,780
'I'm sorry, but they took all your tobacco
and ate a lot of cornbread.

665
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,440
I just gave them what they wanted.

666
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,260
Oh, Charles!

667
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:50,000
I was afraid!'

668
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,470
'You did the right thing,' Pa told her.

669
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:57,609
'We don't want to make enemies of the Indians.'

670
00:54:57,609 --> 00:55:01,060
Then he said, 'What a smell!'

671
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:06,329
'They wore fresh skunk skins around their
waists,' said Ma.

672
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:11,530
'And that was all they wore.'

673
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:18,920
Later, when Laura and Mary were helping Pa
clean the prairie chickens, Laura said, 'I

674
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,470
wanted to untie Jack to eat those Indians.'

675
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:31,049
Pa laid down his knife and asked in a terrible
voice, 'Did you girls even think of untying

676
00:55:31,049 --> 00:55:32,440
Jack?'

677
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,180
Laura dropped her head and whispered, 'Yes,
Pa.'

678
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,660
'After I told you not to?'

679
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,510
Pa said, in a more terrible voice.

680
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:50,829
'Yes, Pa,' Mary whispered, almost crying.

681
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:53,060
For a moment Pa was silent.

682
00:55:53,060 --> 00:56:01,270
'After this,' he then said in his angry voice,
'you girls must do as I say.

683
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,349
You must always obey me.

684
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:04,910
Do you hear?'

685
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:08,799
'Yes, Pa,' Laura and Mary whispered.

686
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:14,070
'If the Indians come again and Jack is untied,
he'll bite them.

687
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,299
And then there will be trouble.

688
00:56:16,299 --> 00:56:17,380
Bad trouble.

689
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,910
Do you understand?'

690
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:23,299
'Yes, Pa,' the girls said.

691
00:56:23,299 --> 00:56:26,160
But they did not understand.

692
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:34,450
'Do as you're told,' said Pa, 'and you'll
be safe.'

693
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:39,460
One day Pa said that the Indians had left
their little camp on the prairie.

694
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:45,289
'Do you want to see it?' he asked Laura and
Mary.

695
00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:52,890
When the girls jumped up and down with excitement,
Pa said, 'Come on then, let's go.'

696
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:56,359
The ground was hot under their feet.

697
00:56:56,359 --> 00:57:01,890
They went farther and farther into the big
prairie.

698
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:08,200
At last they went down into the little valley
where the Indians had camped.

699
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,309
Laura and Mary looked around.

700
00:57:11,309 --> 00:57:16,260
There were small animals, flowers, and trees.

701
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,790
It was a beautiful secret place.

702
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:24,050
'Pa, are there other Indian camps on the prairie?'

703
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:25,180
Laura asked.

704
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:28,410
'Yes, Laura,' he answered.

705
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:32,920
'Are there Indians in them?' she whispered.

706
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,640
'I don't know,' said Pa.

707
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,220
'Perhaps.'

708
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:46,059
She held one of his hands and Mary held the
other, and together they looked at the Indians'

709
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:47,059
camp.

710
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:48,990
There were old campfires.

711
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:56,010
They could see where Indian horses had eaten
the grass, where big and small moccasins had

712
00:57:56,010 --> 00:58:01,079
walked, and where Indians had cooked and eaten.

713
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:04,810
Suddenly Laura shouted, 'Look!

714
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,920
Look!'

715
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,440
Something bright blue was shining on the ground.

716
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,330
She picked it up.

717
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:15,710
It was a beautiful blue bead.

718
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:19,500
Laura shouted with excitement.

719
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:27,890
Then Mary saw a red bead, and Laura saw a
green one, and they forgot everything except

720
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:28,890
beads.

721
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:38,119
They found white beads and brown beads, and
more and more red and blue beads.

722
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:42,270
All that afternoon they looked for beads.

723
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:46,630
When they had finished, the sun was going
down.

724
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:51,150
Laura had a handful of beads, and so did Mary.

725
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:58,820
Pa put them carefully in his pockets, and
they all went home together.

726
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:04,869
Supper was cooking on the fire when they arrived,
and Baby Carrie was playing on the floor.

727
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:13,030
'Sorry we're late!' said Pa, and then he took
the beads out of his pockets and showed them

728
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:14,720
to Ma.

729
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,319
'But look what the girls found,' he said.

730
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,729
'Oh, they're beautiful!'

731
00:59:21,729 --> 00:59:25,359
Ma said with a smile.

732
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:29,359
Laura thought the beads looked even prettier
than before.

733
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:34,500
She touched her beads with her finger and
watched them shine.

734
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,130
'These are mine,' she said.

735
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:43,839
Then Mary said, 'Carrie can have mine.'

736
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:47,609
Ma waited for Laura to speak.

737
00:59:47,609 --> 00:59:51,050
But Laura didn't want to say anything.

738
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:59,200
She felt all hot inside and wished that Mary
wasn't always such a good girl.

739
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:04,010
But she couldn't let Mary be better than she
was.

740
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:09,569
So she said, slowly, 'Carrie can have mine,
too.'

741
01:00:09,569 --> 01:00:14,640
'You're good little girls,' Ma said.

742
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:22,580
She put Mary's beads into Mary's hands, and
Laura's into Laura's hands, and she said,

743
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:27,839
'You can make a pretty necklace for Carrie
to wear around her neck.'

744
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:34,250
Mary and Laura sat side by side on their bed
and made Carrie's necklace.

745
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:38,280
They didn't say anything.

746
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:44,450
Perhaps Mary felt sweet and good inside, but
Laura didn't.

747
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:47,760
When she looked at Mary she wanted to hit
her.

748
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,579
So she didn't look at her again.

749
01:00:52,579 --> 01:00:55,800
The beads made a beautiful necklace.

750
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,069
Carrie laughed when she saw it.

751
01:00:59,069 --> 01:01:05,400
Then Ma tied it around Carrie's little neck
and Laura felt a little bit better.

752
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:10,080
It looked so pretty on her.

753
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:16,630
But when Carrie felt the beads on her neck,
she tried to break the necklace.

754
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:21,410
So Ma untied it and put it away.

755
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:26,589
'Carrie can wear it when she's older,' Ma
said.

756
01:01:26,589 --> 01:01:30,660
Laura still wanted those pretty beads for
herself.

757
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:35,119
But she knew it had been a wonderful day.

758
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:40,010
She knew she was never going to forget the
Indian camp.

759
01:01:40,010 --> 01:02:03,700
CHAPTER SIX
Summertime on the prairie

760
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:09,150
Summer had come to the prairie, and the air
was still and warm.

761
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:18,119
One evening Laura and Pa were sitting outside
under a big moon while Pa played his fiddle.

762
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:21,529
Everything was so beautiful.

763
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:26,210
Laura wanted it to stay that way forever.

764
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:31,960
Suddenly she heard a strange, low sound far
away.

765
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,420
'What's that?'

766
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,710
she asked.

767
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,510
Pa listened.

768
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:40,559
'Cattle!' he said.

769
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,430
'It must be the cattle herds going north.'

770
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:48,490
They listened together and Laura thought she
could hear a song.

771
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:52,900
'Is that singing, Pa?' she asked.

772
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,380
'Yes,' Pa said.

773
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:58,730
'The cowboys are singing to their cattle.

774
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:12,290
It's time for them to sleep, and you too!'

775
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:19,859
The next morning when Laura ran out of the
house, two strange men were sitting on horses

776
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:21,119
by the stable.

777
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:24,660
They were talking to Pa.

778
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:33,590
They were as red-brown as Indians, and they
wore big, wide hats and cowboy boots.

779
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:38,910
Handkerchiefs were tied around their necks,
and guns were at their sides.

780
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:44,099
They said goodbye to Pa and rode away across
the hot prairie.

781
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:47,720
'What a piece of luck!'

782
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,180
Pa said to Ma.

783
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:52,150
'Those men are cowboys.

784
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:56,670
They want me to help them to move the cattle
across the creek.

785
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,020
They'll pay me with beef.

786
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:01,710
How would you like a good piece of beef?'

787
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,970
'Oh, Charles!'

788
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:09,529
Ma said, and her eyes shone.

789
01:04:09,529 --> 01:04:13,859
Pa tied his biggest handkerchief around his
neck.

790
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:21,910
He showed Laura how a cowboy pulls it up over
his mouth and nose to keep the dust out.

791
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:26,460
Then Pa rode Patty down the Indian trail.

792
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:33,619
All day the sun shone hot and the sound of
cattle herds came nearer.

793
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:39,279
Laura and Mary could see the dust that they
made.

794
01:04:39,279 --> 01:04:46,800
Pa came riding home as the sun was going down,
covered with dust.

795
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:54,190
There was dust in his hair and around his
eyes, and dust fell from his clothes.

796
01:04:54,190 --> 01:05:01,380
He was going to work again the next day because
the cattle were not across the creek yet.

797
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:06,730
The cattle moved slowly, eating grass as they
went.

798
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:12,660
Pa fell asleep soon after supper that night.

799
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:19,230
Laura lay awake and listened to the sounds
of the cattle on the prairie and the high,

800
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:22,470
lonely songs of the cowboys.

801
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:38,950
The songs sounded like the crying of wolves
under the moon, and they made Laura feel sad.

802
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:44,770
All the next day, Laura and Mary watched the
prairie.

803
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:51,309
Suddenly out of the dusty grass, not far from
the stable, cattle came running.

804
01:05:51,309 --> 01:05:57,359
They ran fast, their feet beating the ground.

805
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:04,380
A cowboy on a black-and-white horse rode faster
to get in front of them.

806
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:10,150
He waved his big hat and shouted at the cattle
as he moved them along.

807
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:16,589
They all went over a low hill and disappeared.

808
01:06:16,589 --> 01:06:21,849
Laura ran around outside, waving her hat and
shouting wildly.

809
01:06:21,849 --> 01:06:23,930
'Laura,' Ma said.

810
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:25,319
'Stop that!

811
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:29,900
A young lady shouldn't shout like that.'

812
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:34,680
'I wish I could be a cowboy, Ma,' Laura said.

813
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:44,250
Late that afternoon, Laura saw Pa riding home
with two cowboys, a cow, and a little black-and-white

814
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,340
calf.

815
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:51,240
Pa tied the cow to the stable and said goodbye
to the cowboys.

816
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:55,880
Ma's eyes opened wide when she saw their new
animals.

817
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:02,570
'They gave me the cow because she was too
thin to sell,' Pa said when he came in the

818
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:03,570
house.

819
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:06,250
'And the calf is too small to travel.

820
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:09,260
They gave me the beef, too.'

821
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:15,369
Then Pa went out to the stable to get some
milk from the cow for Baby Carrie.

822
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:19,560
They watched her drink all that good milk.

823
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:25,609
Baby Carrie's little red tongue cleaned her
milky lips and she laughed.

824
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:32,160
Ma cooked the beef and everyone felt happy.

825
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:37,730
Nothing had ever tasted as good as that thick,
red meat.

826
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:45,850
The cattle were far away now, and the girls
couldn't hear the songs of the cowboys any

827
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:47,970
more.

828
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:54,839
A little later in the year, there were blackberries,
and in the hot afternoons, Laura went with

829
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:58,960
Ma to pick them in the bushes by the creek.

830
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:07,049
There were mosquitoes everywhere in the blackberry
bushes, and they liked to bite Laura and Ma.

831
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:14,359
Laura's fingers and her mouth got purple-black
from eating the big blackberries.

832
01:08:14,359 --> 01:08:20,250
Her face, hands, and feet were covered with
mosquito bites.

833
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:26,320
But every day they brought home buckets full
of berries, and Ma laid them out in the sun

834
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,710
to dry.

835
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:34,490
In the day there were only a few mosquitoes
in the house.

836
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:41,800
But at night, if the wind wasn't blowing hard,
there were lots of them.

837
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:48,760
On still nights Pa burned wet grass around
the house to keep the mosquitoes away, but

838
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:52,120
they came just the same.

839
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:59,000
Pa could not play his fiddle in the evenings
because so many mosquitoes bit him.

840
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:06,430
Mr Edwards did not visit after supper, because
there were too many mosquitoes in the creek.

841
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:13,370
And every morning Laura's face was full of
red mosquito bites.

842
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:21,350
'It'll get colder soon,' Pa said, 'and then
they'll go.'

843
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:24,340
Laura did not feel very well.

844
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:32,230
One day she felt cold even in the hot sun,
and she could not get warm by the fire.

845
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:36,490
'Why don't you and Mary go out to play?'

846
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:37,810
Ma asked Laura.

847
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:41,270
'I don't want to play,' answered Laura.

848
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:44,560
'I'm tired and I ache.'

849
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,200
Ma stopped her work.

850
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,840
'Where do you ache?'

851
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,340
'I don't know,' said Laura.

852
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:54,670
'I just ache.

853
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:57,000
My legs ache.'

854
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,850
'I ache, too,' Mary said.

855
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:04,710
Ma put her hand against Laura's face.

856
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:10,850
'You're as hot as fire,' she said.

857
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:16,350
Laura felt like crying, but of course she
didn't.

858
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:18,670
Only little babies cried.

859
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:22,460
'I'm cold now,' she said.

860
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,120
'And my back aches.'

861
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,110
'Charles,' Ma called.

862
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:29,040
'Look at the girls.

863
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,380
I think they're sick.'

864
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:37,330
Pa and Ma put them to bed in the middle of
the day.

865
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:44,180
Laura did not really go to sleep, but she
did not really wake up again for a long, long

866
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,640
time.

867
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,730
Strange things seemed to be happening.

868
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:54,220
She heard voices, but no words.

869
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:59,830
Sometimes she felt as cold as ice, and then
she was burning.

870
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:05,220
Days and nights passed like this.

871
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:09,650
She heard Pa say, 'Go to bed, Caroline.'

872
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:17,330
Ma said, 'You're sicker than I am, Charles.'

873
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:23,950
Then one day Laura opened her eyes and saw
the bright light of the sun.

874
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:31,230
Mary was beside her crying, 'I want a drink
of water!

875
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:35,540
I want a drink of water!'

876
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:39,580
Jack was walking between the big bed and her
little bed.

877
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:44,930
Pa was lying on the floor by the big bed.

878
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:49,470
Jack took Pa's shirt in his teeth and shook
it.

879
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:57,440
Pa's head lifted up a little, and he said,
'I must get up, I must.

880
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,810
Caroline and the girls.'

881
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:04,750
Then his head fell back and he lay still.

882
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:07,910
Jack howled.

883
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:12,250
Laura tried to get up, but she was too tired.

884
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:18,560
Then she saw Ma's red face looking from the
big bed.

885
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,390
Mary was still crying for water.

886
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:32,230
Ma looked at Mary and then she looked at Laura,
and she whispered, 'Laura, can you get up?'

887
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:34,150
'Yes, Ma.'

888
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:36,070
Laura said.

889
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:44,470
This time she got out of bed, but when she
tried to stand up, she fell down again.

890
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:52,230
She felt Jack's tongue on her face and she
held onto him and sat up.

891
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:58,200
She knew she must get water for Mary, and
she did.

892
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:04,490
She crawled all the way across the floor to
the water bucket and then crawled all the

893
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:08,330
way back to Mary with the water.

894
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:14,150
Mary's eyes did not open, but her mouth drank
all the water.

895
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:18,330
Then she stopped crying.

896
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:21,730
Laura crawled back into bed.

897
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:28,270
It was a long time before she began to get
warm again.

898
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:34,480
Sometimes she heard Jack howling and she thought
he was a wolf.

899
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:39,960
She lay in bed burning and hearing him howl.

900
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:47,400
She heard the voices talking again, and she
opened her eyes and saw a big, black face

901
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,730
close to hers.

902
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:53,080
Its eyes were black and soft.

903
01:13:53,080 --> 01:14:02,090
This face smiled, and a deep voice said softly,
'Drink this, little girl.'

904
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:07,790
Laura opened her mouth but the drink was bitter
and she turned her head away.

905
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:11,770
The deep voice said again, 'Drink it.

906
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:13,740
It will make you well.'

907
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:18,600
So she drank the bitter medicine.

908
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:24,040
When Laura woke again a fat woman was by the
fire.

909
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:32,430
She brought Laura water and a cup of something
hot that tasted good, like chicken.

910
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:38,590
'Drink it all up, like a good child,' she
said.

911
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:47,630
Laura looked at Mary asleep beside her; she
looked at Pa and Ma asleep in the big bed.

912
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:51,510
Jack lay half asleep on the floor.

913
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:57,910
Laura looked again at the fat woman and asked,
'Who are you?'

914
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:02,570
'I'm Mrs Scott,' she said, smiling.

915
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:06,410
'I'm here to take care of everything until
you're all well.

916
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:10,480
Now go to sleep.'

917
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:19,160
The next morning Laura felt so much better
that she wanted to get up, but Mrs Scott said

918
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:24,440
she must stay in bed until the doctor came.

919
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,910
Laura was surprised when she saw him.

920
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:31,040
He was the black man!

921
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:37,950
Laura had never seen a black man before, and
she could not take her eyes off Dr Tan.

922
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:47,640
He talked with Pa and Ma and laughed his big
laugh before he hurried away.

923
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:53,040
Mrs Scott said that all the settlers along
the creek were sick.

924
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:58,920
She had been going from house to house, working
day and night.

925
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:03,540
'You're lucky to be alive,' she said.

926
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:07,070
'It's because Dr Tan found you when he did.'

927
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:12,350
Dr Tan was a doctor with the Indians.

928
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:19,280
He was on his way to the town of Independence
when he passed Pa's house.

929
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:29,150
Strangely Jack, who usually hated strangers,
had run after Dr Tan and made him come in.

930
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:35,600
'And here you all were, more dead than alive,'
Mrs Scott said.

931
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,910
'All of you sick at the same time.

932
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:43,700
Dr Tan stayed with you a day and a night before
I came.

933
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:48,520
Now he's taking care of all the sick settlers.'

934
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:53,830
The next day Pa and Laura were out of bed.

935
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:58,190
The next day, Ma got up, and then Mary.

936
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:04,910
They were all thin and shaky, but they could
take care of themselves.

937
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:07,760
So Mrs Scott went home.

938
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:11,580
'How can we ever thank you?'

939
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:13,910
Ma said.

940
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:17,160
'It's nothing,' Mrs Scott said.

941
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,910
'Neighbours are there to help each other.'

942
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:28,000
Pa was thinner and walked slowly, and Ma often
sat down.

943
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,320
Mary and Laura didn't feel like playing.

944
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:35,680
But every day they got a little bit stronger.

945
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:42,580
Pa couldn't work outside, so he sat in the
house and made a beautiful chair for Ma.

946
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:48,930
He played his fiddle, and Mary and Laura were
happy.

947
01:17:48,930 --> 01:18:18,680
No one knew, in those days, that the illness
was malaria, and that it came from the mosquitoes.

948
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:43,930
CHAPTER SEVEN
Mr Edwards meets Santa Claus

949
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:46,480
The prairie had changed.

950
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:51,230
Now the days were short and cold and the wind
howled.

951
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:56,430
Day after day the cold rain fell.

952
01:18:56,430 --> 01:19:02,890
Mary and Laura played close to the fire and
listened to the wet sound of rain.

953
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:07,050
The nights were cold, but it never snowed.

954
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:12,540
Every morning they saw only sad, wet grass.

955
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:17,230
They wished they could see snow.

956
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:25,640
Laura was worried because Christmas was near,
and Santa Claus could not travel without snow.

957
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:32,160
Mary thought that, with or without snow, perhaps
Santa Claus couldn't find them, so far away

958
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,800
in Indian Territory.

959
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,060
'What day is it?'

960
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,610
the girls asked Ma.

961
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:42,020
'How many more days until Christmas?'

962
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:49,160
And they counted the days until there was
only one more day to go.

963
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,820
Rain was still falling that morning.

964
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:59,110
'Perhaps there won't be a Christmas this year,'
Laura said.

965
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:02,350
Still she went on hoping.

966
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:09,410
But when Ma opened the door to let in some
air and Laura heard the noise of the creek,

967
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:13,950
she knew there was not going to be a Christmas
that year.

968
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:18,680
The creek was full and roaring with water.

969
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,980
Santa Claus could not possibly cross it.

970
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:27,150
Pa came in, bringing a big fat turkey.

971
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:31,300
'How's that for a Christmas dinner?' he asked.

972
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:37,210
'Pa, is the water in the creek going down?'

973
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:38,210
Mary asked.

974
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:42,400
'No, Mary, the water is moving fast.

975
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:49,640
It'll be too dangerous for Mr Edwards to try
to cross it now,' Pa replied.

976
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:56,850
Mr Edwards was invited to eat Christmas dinner
with them, but now it looked impossible.

977
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:59,240
'No,' Pa said.

978
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,980
'I don't think Edwards will be here tomorrow.'

979
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:07,920
'Then Santa Claus can't come either,' said
Mary.

980
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,540
'It's too bad,' Ma said.

981
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:16,120
'But I know he hasn't forgotten you girls.

982
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:20,170
He'll come next year, I'm sure.'

983
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:21,170
Still.

984
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:23,520
Laura and Mary were not happy.

985
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,910
It did not seem at all like Christmas.

986
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:31,260
Even Pa did not want to play his fiddle.

987
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:37,580
After a long while, Ma suddenly stood up.

988
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:42,710
'I'm going to put up your stockings, girls,'
she said.

989
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:45,750
'Perhaps something will happen.'

990
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:48,870
Laura's heart jumped.

991
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:55,390
But then she remembered the roaring creek
and felt sad.

992
01:21:55,390 --> 01:22:00,950
She and Mary watched Ma put their stockings
over the fireplace.

993
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:08,520
'Now go to sleep,' Ma said, kissing them as
they lay in their beds.

994
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:13,210
'Morning will come quicker if you're asleep.'

995
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:20,300
Then Laura heard Jack growl and someone crying,
'Ingalls!

996
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,100
Ingalls!'

997
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:27,120
When Pa opened the door, Laura saw that it
was morning.

998
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,140
'Edwards!

999
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:31,200
Come in, man!

1000
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,450
What's happened?

1001
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:34,600
Come sit by the fire!'

1002
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,070
Pa said.

1003
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:40,280
Mr Edwards was shaking with cold.

1004
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:45,260
'I swam across the creek,' he said.

1005
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:48,500
'I carried my clothes on my head.

1006
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:52,310
But I'll be all right as soon as I get warm.'

1007
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:56,060
'It was too dangerous, Edwards,' Pa said.

1008
01:22:56,060 --> 01:23:01,800
'We're happy you're here, but it was too dangerous
for a Christmas dinner.'

1009
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:07,560
'Your little ones needed a Christmas,' Mr
Edwards replied.

1010
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:14,620
'I had their presents from Independence, so
no creek could stop me.'

1011
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:17,170
Laura sat straight up in bed.

1012
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:20,950
'Did you see Santa Claus in Independence?'

1013
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:22,500
she shouted.

1014
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,640
'I sure did.'

1015
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:27,080
Mr Edwards said.

1016
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,080
'Where?

1017
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,080
When?

1018
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,070
What did he look like?

1019
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:34,350
Did he really give you something for us?'

1020
01:23:34,350 --> 01:23:36,070
Mary and Laura cried.

1021
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:40,480
'Wait, wait a minute!'

1022
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,850
Mr Edwards laughed.

1023
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:51,120
'I'll put Santa's presents in your stockings,
girls,' said Ma, 'like Santa usually does.

1024
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,420
You mustn't look.'

1025
01:23:53,420 --> 01:24:01,310
They tried not to look at Ma as Mr Edwards
answered all their questions.

1026
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:08,500
When he saw the creek was so full, he said,
he knew Santa Claus could not get across it.

1027
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:12,340
'But you did,' said Laura.

1028
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:16,100
'Yes, but I'm young.

1029
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:18,570
Santa Claus is too old and fat.

1030
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:23,930
I knew that Santa could only get as far south
as Independence.

1031
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:29,230
So I walked to Independence and met Santa
coming up the street, and the first thing

1032
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:32,210
he said to me was "Hello Edwards".'

1033
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:37,110
'How did he know you?' asked Laura.

1034
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:42,490
'Santa Claus knows everybody,' said Mr Edwards.

1035
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:48,870
And he said he knew two good little girls
named Mary and Laura who lived by the Verdigris

1036
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:49,910
River.

1037
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:54,880
He asked me to bring your presents for him
this year because with the water so high,

1038
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,510
he couldn't cross the creek himself.

1039
01:24:57,510 --> 01:25:02,960
So here I am, sent by Santa Claus.'

1040
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:08,830
Laura and Mary were silent a minute, thinking
about that.

1041
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:11,130
Then Ma said.

1042
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:12,950
'You may look now.

1043
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:14,130
girls.'

1044
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:18,900
Something was shining bright in the top of
Laura's stocking.

1045
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:21,650
She jumped out of bed.

1046
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:28,040
So did Mary, but Laura beat her to the fireplace.

1047
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:34,600
And the shining thing was a bright new tin
cup.

1048
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,550
Mary had one just like it.

1049
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:42,870
These new tin cups were their very own.

1050
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:47,600
Now they each had a cup to drink from.

1051
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:55,480
Laura jumped up and down and shouted and laughed,
but Mary stood still and looked with bright

1052
01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:00,100
eyes at her own tin cup.

1053
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:04,160
Then they reached into the stockings again.

1054
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:09,980
And they pulled out two long sticks of red
and white candy.

1055
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:16,180
They looked and looked at that beautiful candy.

1056
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:25,040
Laura put her tongue on her candy, just to
taste it, but Mary only looked at hers.

1057
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:28,500
Those stockings were not empty yet.

1058
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:35,010
They each pulled out a little cake shaped
like a heart.

1059
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:43,470
They had white sugar - like snow - on top
and were too pretty to eat.

1060
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:48,010
Laura and Mary just sat there, but then Ma
said.

1061
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:51,710
Are you sure the stockings are empty?'

1062
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:55,210
The girls put their arms down inside them
again.

1063
01:26:55,210 --> 01:27:03,750
And in the toe of each stocking was a shiny
bright new penny!

1064
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:06,420
They could not speak.

1065
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:12,020
There had never been such a Christmas.

1066
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:14,350
'Aren't you going to thank Mr Edwards?'

1067
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:16,680
Ma said gently.

1068
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:20,550
'Oh, thank you, Mr Edwards!

1069
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:22,100
Thank you!'

1070
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:28,390
they said, and they meant it with all their
hearts.

1071
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:38,720
Pa shook Mr Edwards' hand, and Pa and Ma and
Mr Edwards looked like they were almost crying.

1072
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:42,090
Laura didn't know why.

1073
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,490
Then Ma's eyes opened wide.

1074
01:27:45,490 --> 01:27:50,410
Mr Edwards was taking sweet potatoes from
his pockets.

1075
01:27:50,410 --> 01:27:55,000
They were for Christmas dinner.

1076
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:00,400
Mr Edwards had brought them all the way from
town, too.

1077
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,720
'It's too much, Edwards,' Pa said.

1078
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,480
'We can never thank you enough.'

1079
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:13,000
For Christmas dinner there was the big, tasty
turkey.

1080
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:19,400
There was bread that Ma had made, and there
were the sweet potatoes.

1081
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:26,320
And after all that, they ate dried blackberries
and little cakes.

1082
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:38,160
Then Pa and Ma and Mr Edwards sat by the fire
and talked about Christmas times back in Wisconsin.

1083
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:43,320
Mary and Laura looked at their beautiful cakes
and played with their pennies.

1084
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:49,560
Little by little, they ate their sticks of
candy.

1085
01:28:49,560 --> 01:29:09,650
That was a happy Christmas.

1086
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:14,110
CHAPTER EIGHT
More and more Indians

1087
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:44,240
The nights were still cold on the High Prairie,
and the days were short and grey.

1088
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:50,450
Indians came riding on the path that passed
so close to the house.

1089
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:59,400
They sat up straight on their naked horses
and did not look right or left.

1090
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:03,800
But their black eyes shone.

1091
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:09,100
Mary and Laura sat against the house and looked
up at them.

1092
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:16,190
'I'm sorry I built the house so close to the
Indian trail,' Pa said.

1093
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:18,320
'But I thought they didn't use it anymore.'

1094
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:25,970
'Yes, there are so many Indians around here,'
Ma said.

1095
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:30,110
'I can't look up without seeing one.'

1096
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:37,070
As she spoke she looked up, and there stood
an Indian.

1097
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:43,230
He was in the doorway and they had not heard
a sound.

1098
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:45,780
'Oh, dear!'

1099
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:49,610
Ma whispered, frightened.

1100
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:52,790
Jack jumped at the Indian.

1101
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:56,500
Pa caught him just in time.

1102
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,890
'How!'

1103
01:30:57,890 --> 01:30:59,481
the Indian said to Pa.

1104
01:30:59,481 --> 01:31:07,490
Pa held onto Jack and replied, 'How!'

1105
01:31:07,490 --> 01:31:12,940
He pulled Jack over to the bed and tied him
there.

1106
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:20,860
The Indian came in and sat down by the fire,
and Pa sat down next to him.

1107
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:30,590
They sat there, friendly but not talking,
while Ma finished cooking dinner.

1108
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:34,840
Laura and Mary were quiet on their bed in
the corner.

1109
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:41,210
They couldn't take their eyes from that Indian.

1110
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:50,150
He was so still that the beautiful eagle feathers
in his hair did not move.

1111
01:31:50,150 --> 01:31:59,860
He wore trousers made of animal skins, and
his moccasins were covered with beads.

1112
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:04,110
Pa and the Indian ate silently.

1113
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:08,390
Then Pa gave the Indian some tobacco for his
pipe.

1114
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:20,920
They filled their pipes, lighted them, and
silently smoked until the pipes were empty.

1115
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:25,130
All this time nobody had said anything.

1116
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:31,270
But now the Indian said something to Pa.

1117
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:34,020
Pa shook his head and said.

1118
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,020
'No speak.'

1119
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:40,640
They all sat silent a while longer.

1120
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:48,880
Then the tall Indian got up and went away
without a sound.

1121
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,020
'Oh, dear!'

1122
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:54,220
Ma said again.

1123
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:59,290
Pa said the Indian was an important man.

1124
01:32:59,290 --> 01:33:02,020
'He wore eagle feathers in his hair.

1125
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:05,410
I think he was an Osage Indian.

1126
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:07,660
I'm sure that was French he was speaking.

1127
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:10,110
I wish I spoke some French.'

1128
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:18,590
'I think Indians should stay together with
other Indians,' Ma said, 'and we'll do the

1129
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:19,590
same.'

1130
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:23,820
'Don't worry, Caroline,' Pa said.

1131
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:26,950
'That Indian was very friendly.

1132
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:30,800
And their camps down along the creek are quiet
enough.

1133
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:38,630
If we're polite to them and watch Jack, we
won't have any trouble.'

1134
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:47,710
The very next morning when Pa opened the door,
Laura saw Jack standing on the Indian trail,

1135
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:51,730
showing all his teeth.

1136
01:33:51,730 --> 01:34:00,620
Right in front of him was the tall Indian,
sitting very still on his horse.

1137
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:04,390
Jack looked ready to jump at them.

1138
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:14,420
When the Indian saw Pa, he lifted his gun
and pointed it straight at Jack.

1139
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:22,690
Pa ran to the trail and pulled Jack out of
the way, and the Indian rode on.

1140
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:25,870
'We were lucky that time!'

1141
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:27,800
Pa said.

1142
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,250
'Well, it's his path.

1143
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:35,210
It was an Indian trail long before we came.'

1144
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:40,070
After that, Jack was always tied up.

1145
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:46,710
He got crosser and crosser, but there was
nothing Pa could do about it.

1146
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:56,070
'If Jack hurts an Indian,' he said, 'there
will be bad trouble.'

1147
01:34:56,070 --> 01:35:04,230
Wild animals were wearing their thick winter
fur, and Pa went hunting every day.

1148
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:10,570
He caught small animals and shot large ones
for their fur.

1149
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:16,020
He carefully put the skins outside the house
to dry in the sun.

1150
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:26,520
In the evenings he pulled the dry skins between
his hands to make them soft, and every day

1151
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:31,310
the bundle of furs on the floor grew bigger.

1152
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:36,520
Laura loved to feel the soft fur in her fingers.

1153
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:43,180
Pa was saving all these furs to trade next
spring in Independence.

1154
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:51,380
One day when Pa was hunting, two Indians walked
right into the house.

1155
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:54,510
They were dirty and cross.

1156
01:35:54,510 --> 01:36:03,090
One of them looked at all the things in Ma's
cupboard and took all the cornbread.

1157
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:07,150
The other took Pa's tobacco.

1158
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:13,400
Then one of them picked up the bundle of furs.

1159
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:20,170
Ma held Baby Carrie in her arms, and Mary
and Laura stood close to her.

1160
01:36:20,170 --> 01:36:29,210
They looked at that Indian taking all Pa's
furs but they couldn't do anything to stop

1161
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:31,970
him.

1162
01:36:31,970 --> 01:36:37,360
The Indian carried the furs as far as the
door.

1163
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:45,930
Then the other Indian said something to him
in an angry voice, and he dropped the bundle.

1164
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:50,700
They finally went away.

1165
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:59,500
Ma sat down and pulled Mary and Laura close
to her, and Laura felt Ma's heart beating.

1166
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:09,440
'Well,' said Ma, smiling, 'I'm thankful they
didn't take the plough and seeds.'

1167
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,770
Laura was surprised.

1168
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:14,600
She asked, 'What plough?'

1169
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:20,880
'Your Pa is going to trade that bundle of
furs for a plough and lots of different seeds

1170
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,750
in the spring.'

1171
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:25,930
Ma said.

1172
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:33,820
When Pa came home they told him about those
Indians, and he looked serious.

1173
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:37,020
'But all's well that ends well,' he said.

1174
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:40,950
'And soon all the Indians here will move west.'

1175
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:43,890
'Why do they go west?'

1176
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:44,980
Laura asked.

1177
01:37:44,980 --> 01:37:50,950
'When white settlers arrive in a place, the
Indians have to move away from there.'

1178
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:52,420
'But why?'

1179
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:54,700
'The government makes them.

1180
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:55,700
Laura.'

1181
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:56,700
Pa said.

1182
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:58,920
'That's why we're here.

1183
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:02,270
Lots of white people are going to come and
live here.

1184
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:05,360
We came first to choose the best land.

1185
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,610
Now do you understand?'

1186
01:38:06,610 --> 01:38:07,610
'Yes.

1187
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:09,200
Pa,' Laura said.

1188
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,200
'But.

1189
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:14,240
Pa, I thought this was Indian Territory.

1190
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:17,360
Won't the Indians be angry if they have to-'

1191
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:21,130
'No more questions, Laura,' Pa said.

1192
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:27,710
'It's time for bed.'

1193
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:30,310
Winter ended at last.

1194
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:36,840
The wind was softer, and the terrible cold
was gone.

1195
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:42,200
One day Pa said it was time to take his furs
to Independence.

1196
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:44,540
Ma said.

1197
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:48,000
'But the Indians are so near!'

1198
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,050
'They're very friendly.'

1199
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:52,050
Pa said.

1200
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:55,670
'I often meet them when I'm hunting in the
forest.

1201
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:58,560
You needn't be afraid of them.'

1202
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,630
'No,' Ma said.

1203
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:08,050
But Laura knew that Ma was afraid of Indians.

1204
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:11,040
'You must go, Charles,' she said.

1205
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,800
'We must have a plough and seeds.

1206
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:21,480
And you'll be back soon.'

1207
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:29,440
The next morning before the sun came up, Pa
got the horses ready, put the furs into the

1208
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:37,250
wagon, and drove away.

1209
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:42,690
Laura and Mary counted the long, empty days.

1210
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:52,400
One, two, three, four, and still Pa had not
come home.

1211
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:58,580
Ma said it was taking him a long time to trade
his furs in town.

1212
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:08,060
In the afternoon of the fifth day, Laura and
Mary were playing a game outside.

1213
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:11,840
The weather was wild and sweet.

1214
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:20,470
The wind smelled like spring, and birds were
flying north in the wide blue sky.

1215
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:27,500
Suddenly Mary stopped and said, 'What's that?'

1216
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:30,410
Laura had already heard the strange noise.

1217
01:40:30,410 --> 01:40:36,070
'It's the Indians,' she said.

1218
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:38,040
Mary stood still.

1219
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,430
She was frightened.

1220
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:48,750
Laura was not really afraid, but that noise
made her feel strange.

1221
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:59,920
It was the sound of many Indian voices, something
like an axe cutting wood or like a dog barking.

1222
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:08,090
It was wild, but it didn't seem angry.

1223
01:41:08,090 --> 01:41:12,020
Ma came outdoors and listened for a minute.

1224
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:16,400
Then she locked the animals in the stable.

1225
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:21,590
She told Laura and Mary to bring wood into
the house.

1226
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:27,730
The sound was getting louder, now, and faster.

1227
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:32,090
It made Laura's heart beat fast.

1228
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:36,550
'Come inside the house, now,' Ma said.

1229
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:41,600
She took Jack inside, too, and locked the
door.

1230
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:48,760
The sun went down and the sky turned bright
pink.

1231
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:50,610
Ma was busy getting supper ready, but Laura
and Mary watched from the window silently.

1232
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:51,610
All that time the sound from the creek got
louder and louder, faster and faster.

1233
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:52,610
And Laura's heart beat faster and louder.

1234
01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:53,610
Then she heard Pa's wagon!

1235
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:54,610
Laura and Mary ran to the door and jumped
on Pa, who had his arms full.

1236
01:41:54,610 --> 01:41:55,610
Pa laughed his big laugh.

1237
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:56,610
'What do you think I am,' he laughed, 'a tree
to climb?'

1238
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:57,610
He dropped his bundles on the table and put
his big arms around them.

1239
01:41:57,610 --> 01:41:58,610
'Listen to the Indians.

1240
01:41:58,610 --> 01:41:59,610
Pa,' Laura said.

1241
01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:00,610
'Why are they making that strange noise?'

1242
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:01,610
'Oh, they're having some kind of jamboree.

1243
01:42:01,610 --> 01:42:02,610
I heard them when I crossed the creek.'

1244
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:03,610
Then he went to put the horses and the new
plough in the stable.

1245
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:04,610
When he came back, they opened the bundles.

1246
01:42:04,610 --> 01:42:05,610
He had bought brown sugar, coffee, cornmeal,
salt, and all the seeds that they needed.

1247
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:06,610
Then Pa gave Ma a packet.

1248
01:42:06,610 --> 01:42:07,610
He watched her open it with his big smile.

1249
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:08,610
There was pretty cotton cloth in it for her
to make herself a dress.

1250
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:09,610
'Oh, Charles, you shouldn't!

1251
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:10,610
It's too much!'

1252
01:42:10,610 --> 01:42:11,610
she cried.

1253
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:12,610
But her face shone with happiness.

1254
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:13,610
Mary watched Pa quietly, but Laura climbed
onto his leg and began beating him with her

1255
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:14,610
hands.

1256
01:42:14,610 --> 01:42:15,610
'Where is it?

1257
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:16,610
Where's my present?'

1258
01:42:16,610 --> 01:42:17,610
she said, beating him.

1259
01:42:17,610 --> 01:42:18,610
Pa laughed his big laugh, like great bells
ringing, and he pulled a packet out of his

1260
01:42:18,610 --> 01:42:19,610
shirt pocket.

1261
01:42:19,610 --> 01:42:20,610
'You first, Mary,' he said, 'because you're
waiting so quietly.'

1262
01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:21,610
And he gave Mary a comb to wear in her hair.

1263
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:22,610
'And here you are, Laura!

1264
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:23,610
This is for you,' he said.

1265
01:42:23,610 --> 01:42:24,610
The combs were just alike.

1266
01:42:24,610 --> 01:42:25,610
They both had a bright star on the top.

1267
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:26,610
Mary's star was blue and Laura's was red.

1268
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:27,610
Ma put the combs in their hair.

1269
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:28,610
They laughed with excitement.

1270
01:42:28,610 --> 01:42:29,610
They had never had anything so pretty.

1271
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:30,610
Ma said, 'But Charles, you didn't get yourself
a thing!'

1272
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:31,610
'Oh, I got myself a plough,' said Pa.

1273
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:32,610
'The weather will soon be warm enough to start
using it.'

1274
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:33,610
That was the happiest supper they had had
in a long time.

1275
01:42:33,610 --> 01:42:34,610
The salt pork that Pa had brought was very
good.

1276
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:35,610
And Pa told them all about the seeds.

1277
01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:36,610
He had got tobacco seeds and corn seeds, and
the seeds of many different kinds of vegetables

1278
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:37,610
like carrots and potatoes.

1279
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:38,610
'I tell you, Caroline, when these seeds grow
in this rich land of ours, we'll be living

1280
01:42:38,610 --> 01:42:39,610
like kings!'

1281
01:42:39,610 --> 01:42:40,610
Pa said.

1282
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:41,610
They had almost forgotten the wild noise from
the Indian camps.

1283
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:42,610
But then Pa said something to Ma that made
Laura sit very still and listen carefully.

1284
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:43,610
'People in Independence say the government
is going to move the white settlers out of

1285
01:42:43,610 --> 01:42:44,610
Indian Territory.'

1286
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:45,610
'Oh.

1287
01:42:45,610 --> 01:42:46,610
no!'

1288
01:42:46,610 --> 01:42:47,610
Ma said.

1289
01:42:47,610 --> 01:42:48,610
'Not when we have done so much.'

1290
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:49,610
'Well, I don't believe what I heard,' Pa said.

1291
01:42:49,610 --> 01:42:50,610
'The government has always let settlers keep
the land.

1292
01:42:50,610 --> 01:42:51,610
I think they'll make the Indians move west
again.'

1293
01:42:51,610 --> 01:42:52,610
Laura lay awake in bed a long time that night.

1294
01:42:52,610 --> 01:42:53,610
She could still hear the noise of the wild
jamboree in the Indian camp.

1295
01:42:53,610 --> 01:42:54,610
Their fierce cries were carried on the screaming
wind.

1296
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:55,610
They made her heart beat faster and faster
and faster.

1297
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:56,610
CHAPTER NINE
Prairie fire

1298
01:42:56,610 --> 01:42:57,610
Spring had come.

1299
01:42:57,610 --> 01:42:58,610
The warm winds smelled exciting, and the outdoors
was large and bright and sweet.

1300
01:42:58,610 --> 01:42:59,610
Big white clouds were high up in the sky,
and you could see their shadows over the prairie.

1301
01:42:59,610 --> 01:43:00,610
Pa was working hard, getting ready to plant
potatoes.

1302
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:01,610
Pet and Patty were working hard, too, pulling
the heavy plough.

1303
01:43:01,610 --> 01:43:02,610
The plough was breaking up the grassy earth,
and turning it over.

1304
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:03,610
Pa liked the land because it was so rich,
and there wasn't a tree or stone in it.

1305
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:04,610
Now many Indians came riding along the Indian
trail.

1306
01:43:04,610 --> 01:43:05,610
Indians were everywhere.

1307
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:06,610
Laura could hear their guns in the creeks
when they were hunting.

1308
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:07,610
Indians often came to the house.

1309
01:43:07,610 --> 01:43:08,610
Some of them were friendly, and some were
not.

1310
01:43:08,610 --> 01:43:09,610
All of them wanted food and tobacco, and Ma
gave them what they wanted.

1311
01:43:09,610 --> 01:43:10,610
But most of the food in the house was hidden.

1312
01:43:10,610 --> 01:43:11,610
Jack was miserable all the time.

1313
01:43:11,610 --> 01:43:12,610
He was always tied up, and all the time he
lay and hated the Indians.

1314
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:13,610
Laura and Mary were not surprised to see Indians
anymore.

1315
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:14,610
But they always felt safer near Pa or Jack.

1316
01:43:14,610 --> 01:43:15,610
One day they were helping Ma to get dinner
ready.

1317
01:43:15,610 --> 01:43:16,610
Baby Carrie was playing on the floor in the
sun, and suddenly the light was gone.

1318
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:17,610
'I think it's going to rain,' Ma said, looking
out the window.

1319
01:43:17,610 --> 01:43:18,610
Laura looked, too, and saw great black clouds
in the south across the sun.

1320
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:19,610
Pet and Patty came running from the field
pulling the plough behind them and with Pa

1321
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,610
running after them.

1322
01:43:20,610 --> 01:43:21,610
'Prairie fire!' he shouted.

1323
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:22,610
'Fill the tub with water!

1324
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:23,610
Put sacks in it!

1325
01:43:23,610 --> 01:43:24,610
Hurry!'

1326
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:25,610
Ma ran to the well, and Laura pulled the tub
to it.

1327
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:26,610
Pa put the cows in the barn.

1328
01:43:26,610 --> 01:43:27,610
Ma started pulling up water as fast as she
could.

1329
01:43:27,610 --> 01:43:28,610
Laura ran to get the sacks from the stable.

1330
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:29,610
The sky was black now in the south, almost
as dark as night.

1331
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:30,610
Pet and Patty were still pulling the plough,
with Pa running behind them.

1332
01:43:30,610 --> 01:43:31,610
Pa was making a long trench all the way around
three sides of the house.

1333
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:32,610
He was shouting at the horses to make them
hurry.

1334
01:43:32,610 --> 01:43:33,610
Frightened rabbits came running across the
prairie past Pa.

1335
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:34,610
When the trench around the house was finished,
Pa tied the horses to the house.

1336
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:35,610
The tub was full of water.

1337
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:36,610
Laura and Ma pushed the sacks into the water
and made them very wet.

1338
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:37,610
'Hurry, Caroline,' Pa shouted.

1339
01:43:37,610 --> 01:43:38,610
'The fire's coming faster than a horse can
run.'

1340
01:43:38,610 --> 01:43:39,610
A big rabbit jumped right over the tub while
Pa and Ma were lifting it.

1341
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:40,610
Ma told Laura to stay at the house.

1342
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:41,610
Pa and Ma carried the heavy tub all the way
to the trench.

1343
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:42,610
Laura stayed close to the house.

1344
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:43,610
She could see the red fire coming under the
big black cloud of smoke.

1345
01:43:43,610 --> 01:43:44,610
Jack was trembling and crying and staying
close to Laura.

1346
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:45,610
The wind was blowing harder and screaming
wildly.

1347
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:46,610
More and more rabbits came running.

1348
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:47,610
Birds screamed in the screaming wind.

1349
01:43:47,610 --> 01:43:48,610
All the wild things on the prairie ran or
jumped or flew as fast as they could go down

1350
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:49,610
to the creek.

1351
01:43:49,610 --> 01:43:50,610
Pa was going along the trench, making a small
fire in the grass on the other side of it.

1352
01:43:50,610 --> 01:43:51,610
Ma followed him with a wet sack, beating violently
at the small fire when it crossed to her side

1353
01:43:51,610 --> 01:43:52,610
of the trench.

1354
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:53,610
Soon Pa's small fire was burning along the
other side of the trench all around the house.

1355
01:43:53,610 --> 01:43:54,610
He and Ma fought it when it crossed the trench
to their side.

1356
01:43:54,610 --> 01:43:55,610
They beat it with the wet sacks, and did not
let it come toward the house.

1357
01:43:55,610 --> 01:43:56,610
The big prairie fire was roaring now, roaring
louder and louder in the screaming wind.

1358
01:43:56,610 --> 01:43:57,610
Great flames turned and climbed high into
the sky.

1359
01:43:57,610 --> 01:43:58,610
Mary and Laura stood against the house and
held hands and trembled.

1360
01:43:58,610 --> 01:43:59,610
Baby Carrie was in the house.

1361
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:00,610
Laura wanted to do something, but inside her
head it was roaring like the fire.

1362
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:01,610
Her body shook.

1363
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:02,610
The smoke burned her nose, and her red eyes
couldn't stop crying.

1364
01:44:02,610 --> 01:44:03,610
Jack howled.

1365
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:04,610
The orange and yellow flames were coming faster
than horses can run, and their terrible light

1366
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:05,610
danced over everything.

1367
01:44:05,610 --> 01:44:06,610
Pa's small fire burned slowly, moving away
from the house.

1368
01:44:06,610 --> 01:44:07,610
Slowly it went to meet the big wall of fire.

1369
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:08,610
And suddenly the big fire ate the little fire.

1370
01:44:08,610 --> 01:44:09,610
The wind screamed louder and the flames climbed
all the way to the sky.

1371
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:10,610
Fire was all around the house.

1372
01:44:10,610 --> 01:44:11,610
Then suddenly it was all over.

1373
01:44:11,610 --> 01:44:12,610
The fire roared past the house and was gone.

1374
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:13,610
Pa and Ma were beating little fires that burned
here and there around the house.

1375
01:44:13,610 --> 01:44:14,610
When those fires were out, Ma came to the
house to wash.

1376
01:44:14,610 --> 01:44:15,610
Her skin was black with smoke, and she was
trembling.

1377
01:44:15,610 --> 01:44:16,610
'Don't worry, girls,' she said.

1378
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:17,610
'Pa's little fire saved us.

1379
01:44:17,610 --> 01:44:18,610
And all's well that ends well.'

1380
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:19,610
The air smelled of burned grass.

1381
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:20,610
Smoke was blowing in the wind.

1382
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:21,610
The wide prairie was black all the way to
the line where the sky began.

1383
01:44:21,610 --> 01:44:22,610
Everything felt different and miserable.

1384
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:23,610
But Pa and Ma were happy because the house
was safe.

1385
01:44:23,610 --> 01:44:24,610
The animals came out of the creek.

1386
01:44:24,610 --> 01:44:25,610
The birds came flying, the rabbits jumped
slowly and looked, and the prairie chickens

1387
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:26,610
came out walking.

1388
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:27,610
That night Mr Edwards and Mr Scott came to
see Pa.

1389
01:44:27,610 --> 01:44:28,610
They were worried.

1390
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:29,610
'Maybe the Indians started the fire to frighten
us.

1391
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:30,610
Maybe they want all the white settlers to
leave,' Mr Scott said.

1392
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:31,610
'I don't believe it,' said Pa.

1393
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:32,610
'The Indians have always burned the prairie
to make the green grass grow more quickly.

1394
01:44:32,610 --> 01:44:33,610
And it's easier for them to ride their horses
in shorter grass.'

1395
01:44:33,610 --> 01:44:34,610
While they were talking, they could hear the
drums that were beating in the camps, and

1396
01:44:34,610 --> 01:44:35,610
the shouts of the Indians.

1397
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:36,610
Laura sat quietly listening to the talk and
to the Indians.

1398
01:44:36,610 --> 01:44:37,610
'There are too many Indians in those camps,'
said Mr Edwards.

1399
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:38,610
'I don't like it.'

1400
01:44:38,610 --> 01:44:39,610
'The only good Indian is a dead Indian,' Mr
Scott said.

1401
01:44:39,610 --> 01:44:40,610
'I don't know,' Pa said.

1402
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:41,610
'I think the Indians are as good as anyone,
if they are left alone.

1403
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:42,610
But the government has moved them west so
many times.

1404
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:43,610
Naturally, they hate white settlers, but they're
afraid of the white soldiers at Fort Dodge

1405
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:44,610
and Fort Gibson.

1406
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:45,610
I don't think they'll make any trouble.'

1407
01:44:45,610 --> 01:44:46,610
'Why are so many of them in the camps?' asked
Mr Scott.

1408
01:44:46,610 --> 01:44:47,610
'They're just getting ready to hunt buffalo.'

1409
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:48,610
Pa said.

1410
01:44:48,610 --> 01:44:49,610
'Well,' Mr Scott said slowly, 'I hope you're
right, Ingalls.

1411
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:50,610
I really hope you're right.'

1412
01:44:50,610 --> 01:44:51,610
CHAPTER TEN
Indian war-cry

1413
01:44:51,610 --> 01:44:52,610
The next day Pa worked in the field, getting
it ready to plant the seeds.

1414
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:53,610
He came in at noon, black from the burned
prairie, but he was pleased.

1415
01:44:53,610 --> 01:44:54,610
He didn't have to worry about the tall grass
anymore.

1416
01:44:54,610 --> 01:44:55,610
But he began to worry about the Indians.

1417
01:44:55,610 --> 01:44:56,610
More and more of them were camping near the
creek.

1418
01:44:56,610 --> 01:44:57,610
Mary and Laura saw the smoke from their fires
by day, and at night they heard fierce shouts.

1419
01:44:57,610 --> 01:44:58,610
When shadows began to fall on the prairie
and the wind was quiet, the noises from the

1420
01:44:58,610 --> 01:44:59,610
Indian camps grew louder and wilder.

1421
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:00,610
Pa shut the horses and cows in the stable
and brought Jack into the house.

1422
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:01,610
No one could go outdoors until morning.

1423
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:02,610
In her sleep Laura heard the wild noises and
beating drums.

1424
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:03,610
One night Pa sat by the fireplace making bullets.

1425
01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:04,610
Laura and Mary lay awake and watched him.

1426
01:45:04,610 --> 01:45:05,610
'Why are you doing that, Pa?'

1427
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:06,610
Mary asked.

1428
01:45:06,610 --> 01:45:07,610
'Oh, I have nothing better to do,' Pa said.

1429
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:08,610
But Laura knew he was tired from working in
the field and wanted to sleep.

1430
01:45:08,610 --> 01:45:09,610
No more Indians came to the house.

1431
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:10,610
Mary did not want to go out of the house anymore,
so Laura had to play outside by herself.

1432
01:45:10,610 --> 01:45:11,610
But she felt strange there.

1433
01:45:11,610 --> 01:45:12,610
The prairie didn't feel safe anymore.

1434
01:45:12,610 --> 01:45:13,610
Mr Scott and Mr Edwards, with their guns,
came and talked to Pa in the field one day.

1435
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:14,610
At dinner, Pa told Ma that some of the settlers
were talking about building a stockade.

1436
01:45:14,610 --> 01:45:15,610
'I told Scott and Edwards that it wasn't a
good idea.

1437
01:45:15,610 --> 01:45:16,610
If we need one, we'll need it before we can
build it.

1438
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:17,610
And the worst thing is to show that we're
afraid.'

1439
01:45:17,610 --> 01:45:18,610
Laura wondered why Pa was talking this way.

1440
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:19,610
Pa was never afraid.

1441
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:20,610
But she was.

1442
01:45:20,610 --> 01:45:21,610
Every night the Indian drums beat faster and
faster, and their cries got wilder and wilder.

1443
01:45:21,610 --> 01:45:22,610
In the middle of the night.

1444
01:45:22,610 --> 01:45:23,610
Laura sat straight up in bed and screamed.

1445
01:45:23,610 --> 01:45:24,610
A terrible sound had woken her.

1446
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:25,610
Ma came quickly and said in her gentle way,
'Be quiet, Laura.

1447
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:26,610
You mustn't frighten Carrie.'

1448
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:27,610
The house was dark, but Ma was still wearing
her dress.

1449
01:45:27,610 --> 01:45:28,610
She had not gone to bed.

1450
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:29,610
Pa stood by the window, looking out.

1451
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:30,610
He had his gun.

1452
01:45:30,610 --> 01:45:31,610
Then that terrible sound came again.

1453
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:32,610
'What is it?'

1454
01:45:32,610 --> 01:45:33,610
Laura screamed.

1455
01:45:33,610 --> 01:45:34,610
'What is it?

1456
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:35,610
Oh, Pa, what is it?'

1457
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:36,610
Pa said, 'It's the Indian war-cry, Laura.'

1458
01:45:36,610 --> 01:45:37,610
Ma made a soft sound, and he said to her,
'They need to know, Caroline.'

1459
01:45:37,610 --> 01:45:38,610
He explained that the Indians were dancing
around their fires and talking about war.

1460
01:45:38,610 --> 01:45:39,610
'But I'm here and Jack's here,' Pa said, 'and
there are soldiers at Fort Dodge.

1461
01:45:39,610 --> 01:45:40,610
So don't be afraid, Mary and Laura.'

1462
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:41,610
'No, Pa,' Laura said.

1463
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:42,610
But she was terribly afraid.

1464
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:43,610
The drums seemed to beat inside her head.

1465
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:44,610
The wild howls were worse than wolves.

1466
01:45:44,610 --> 01:45:45,610
Then they heard the sound of a running horse.

1467
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:46,610
It came nearer and nearer.

1468
01:45:46,610 --> 01:45:47,610
In the light of the moon, Laura saw a little
black horse with an Indian on its back.

1469
01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:48,610
The Indian had a blanket around him, feathers
on his head, and a gun at his side.

1470
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:49,610
He rode by as fast as the wind, and then he
was gone.

1471
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:50,610
'That was the tall Osage Indian who came to
the house once and talked French to me!'

1472
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:51,610
Pa said.

1473
01:45:51,610 --> 01:45:52,610
'What's he doing out at this hour, riding
so fast?'

1474
01:45:52,610 --> 01:45:53,610
Nobody answered because nobody knew.

1475
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:54,610
The next day they could not go out of the
house.

1476
01:45:54,610 --> 01:45:55,610
There was not one sound from the Indian camps.

1477
01:45:55,610 --> 01:45:56,610
The whole wide prairie was still.

1478
01:45:56,610 --> 01:45:57,610
But that night the noise in the camps was
worse than the night before.

1479
01:45:57,610 --> 01:45:58,610
The war-cries were terrible.

1480
01:45:58,610 --> 01:45:59,610
Pa watched at the window with his gun, Laura
and Mary stayed close to Ma, and poor little

1481
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:00,610
Carrie cried.

1482
01:46:00,610 --> 01:46:01,610
Jack growled all night long, and he howled
when the war-cries came.

1483
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:02,610
Night after night, the Indians shouted and
danced and beat their drums.

1484
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:03,610
All up and down the creek, war-cries answered
war-cries.

1485
01:46:03,610 --> 01:46:04,610
The sound filled the prairie.

1486
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:05,610
There was no rest.

1487
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:06,610
Laura ached all over.

1488
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:07,610
The silent days were worse than the nights.

1489
01:46:07,610 --> 01:46:08,610
The animals stayed in the stable.

1490
01:46:08,610 --> 01:46:09,610
Mary and Laura could not go out of the house.

1491
01:46:09,610 --> 01:46:10,610
And Pa watched and listened all the time.

1492
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:11,610
He didn't eat much.

1493
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:12,610
One day his head fell onto the table and he
slept a little.

1494
01:46:12,610 --> 01:46:13,610
He was so tired.

1495
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:14,610
But in a minute he woke up with a jump and
said, crossly, to Ma, 'Don't let me do that

1496
01:46:14,610 --> 01:46:15,610
again!'

1497
01:46:15,610 --> 01:46:16,610
That night was the worst night of all.

1498
01:46:16,610 --> 01:46:17,610
The drums beat faster and the war cries made
their blood run cold.

1499
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:18,610
At the window Pa said, 'Caroline, they're
quarrelling among themselves.

1500
01:46:18,610 --> 01:46:19,610
Maybe they'll fight each other.'

1501
01:46:19,610 --> 01:46:20,610
'Oh, Charles, I hope so!'

1502
01:46:20,610 --> 01:46:21,610
Ma said.

1503
01:46:21,610 --> 01:46:22,610
All night long there was not a minute's rest.

1504
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:23,610
Just before the sun came up, the last war-cry
ended and Laura fell asleep in Ma's arms.

1505
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:24,610
She woke up in bed.

1506
01:46:24,610 --> 01:46:25,610
The door was open, and the sun was high in
the sky.

1507
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:26,610
It was already noon.

1508
01:46:26,610 --> 01:46:27,610
Ma was cooking dinner and Pa was sitting outside
on the step.

1509
01:46:27,610 --> 01:46:28,610
He said to Ma, 'There's another big group,
going off to the south.'

1510
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:29,610
Laura went to the door and saw a long line
of Indians far away.

1511
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:30,610
Pa told her that two long lines of Indians
had gone west that morning.

1512
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:31,610
Now this one was going south.

1513
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:32,610
It meant that the Indians had argued among
themselves and were not going to hunt buffalo

1514
01:46:32,610 --> 01:46:33,610
together.

1515
01:46:33,610 --> 01:46:34,610
'Tonight we'll sleep!'

1516
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:35,610
Pa said, and they did.

1517
01:46:35,610 --> 01:46:36,610
They did not even dream.

1518
01:46:36,610 --> 01:46:37,610
In the morning Pa took his gun and went down
the creek road.

1519
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:38,610
Laura and Mary and Ma stayed in the house
and waited the whole long day.

1520
01:46:38,610 --> 01:46:39,610
When Pa came back in the late afternoon, he
said everything was all right.

1521
01:46:39,610 --> 01:46:40,610
He had gone up and down the creek and seen
many empty Indian camps.

1522
01:46:40,610 --> 01:46:41,610
All the Indian tribes had left, except the
Osages.

1523
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:42,610
He had met an Osage in the forest who could
speak English.

1524
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:43,610
He told Pa that all the tribes except the
Osages wanted to kill the settlers.

1525
01:46:43,610 --> 01:46:44,610
The tall Indian had ridden so far and so fast
that night because he did not want them to

1526
01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:45,610
kill the white people.

1527
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:46,610
He was an Osage chief, and his name was Great
Soldier.

1528
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:47,610
'He went on arguing with them day and night,'
Pa said, 'until the other Osages agreed with

1529
01:46:47,610 --> 01:46:48,610
him.

1530
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:49,610
Then he told the other tribes that the Osages
were ready to fight them to save the white

1531
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:50,610
settlers.'

1532
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:51,610
That was why there had been so much noise
in the camps.

1533
01:46:51,610 --> 01:46:52,610
The Indian tribes were howling at each other.

1534
01:46:52,610 --> 01:46:53,610
In the end, the other tribes did not want
to fight Great Soldier and the Osages.

1535
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:54,610
So they went away.

1536
01:46:54,610 --> 01:46:55,610
'That's one good Indian!'

1537
01:46:55,610 --> 01:46:56,610
Pa said.

1538
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:57,610
There was another long night of sleep.

1539
01:46:57,610 --> 01:46:58,610
In the morning Pa opened the door to let in
the warm spring air.

1540
01:46:58,610 --> 01:46:59,610
He stood on the step, looking east, and he
said, 'Come here, Caroline.

1541
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:00,610
And you, Mary and Laura.'

1542
01:47:00,610 --> 01:47:01,610
Laura ran out first, and she was surprised.

1543
01:47:01,610 --> 01:47:02,610
The Indians were coming.

1544
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:03,610
First came the tall Indian chief who had saved
their lives.

1545
01:47:03,610 --> 01:47:04,610
His black horse was very near now, and Laura's
heart beat fast.

1546
01:47:04,610 --> 01:47:05,610
She looked at the Indian's moccasins, at his
colourful blanket, at his naked brown-red

1547
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:06,610
arms that carried the long gun.

1548
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:07,610
His face was still and tierce.

1549
01:47:07,610 --> 01:47:08,610
Only the long eagle feathers in his hair moved
in the wind.

1550
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:09,610
'Great Soldier himself,' Pa said softly.

1551
01:47:09,610 --> 01:47:10,610
He lifted his hand to say hello.

1552
01:47:10,610 --> 01:47:11,610
But the horse and the Indian chief went by
without looking at Pa or Ma or Mary or Laura

1553
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:12,610
or the house.

1554
01:47:12,610 --> 01:47:13,610
Then other horses and Indians with eagle feathers
in their hair went by.

1555
01:47:13,610 --> 01:47:14,610
Brown face after brown face went by.

1556
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:15,610
Bright beads shone in the sun, and horses'
tails and eagle feathers blew in the wind.

1557
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:16,610
The women and children came riding behind
the Indian men.

1558
01:47:16,610 --> 01:47:17,610
Little naked brown Indians, no bigger than
Mary and Laura, went riding by.

1559
01:47:17,610 --> 01:47:18,610
They did not have to wear clothes.

1560
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:19,610
All their skin was out in the air.

1561
01:47:19,610 --> 01:47:20,610
Their straight black hair blew in the wind
and their black eyes shone with happiness.

1562
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:21,610
Laura looked and looked at the Indian children,
and they looked at her.

1563
01:47:21,610 --> 01:47:22,610
She had a sudden wish to be a little Indian
girl, to ride naked in the wind and the sun.

1564
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:23,610
Then Indian mothers came riding by with babies
in baskets at the sides of their horses.

1565
01:47:23,610 --> 01:47:24,610
Laura looked straight into the bright eyes
of one little baby.

1566
01:47:24,610 --> 01:47:25,610
Its eyes were black as a night when no stars
shine.

1567
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:26,610
'Pa,' she said, 'get me that little Indian
baby!'

1568
01:47:26,610 --> 01:47:27,610
Be quiet, Laura!

1569
01:47:27,610 --> 01:47:28,610
Pa said.

1570
01:47:28,610 --> 01:47:29,610
The baby's head turned and its eyes looked
into Laura's eyes.

1571
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:30,610
'Oh, I want it!

1572
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:31,610
I want it!'

1573
01:47:31,610 --> 01:47:32,610
Laura cried.

1574
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:33,610
'It wants to stay with me.

1575
01:47:33,610 --> 01:47:34,610
Please, Pa, please!'

1576
01:47:34,610 --> 01:47:35,610
'Quiet, Laura,' Pa said.

1577
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:36,610
'The Indian woman wants to keep her baby.'

1578
01:47:36,610 --> 01:47:37,610
Then Laura began to cry.

1579
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:38,610
The little papoose was gone.

1580
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:39,610
She was never going to see it again.

1581
01:47:39,610 --> 01:47:40,610
'I've never heard of such a thing,' Ma said.

1582
01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:41,610
'Why do you want an Indian baby, of all things?'

1583
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:42,610
'Its eyes are so black,' Laura cried.

1584
01:47:42,610 --> 01:47:43,610
She could not say what she meant.

1585
01:47:43,610 --> 01:47:44,610
No one was hungry for dinner.

1586
01:47:44,610 --> 01:47:45,610
Pa and Ma and Mary and Laura stayed by the
door and looked at the long line of Indians

1587
01:47:45,610 --> 01:47:46,610
until nothing was left but silence and emptiness.

1588
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:47,610
All the world seemed very quiet and lonely.

1589
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:48,610
One morning the whole prairie was green.

1590
01:47:48,610 --> 01:47:49,610
Pa hurried into the field with the horses
and his plough, and Mary and Laura helped

1591
01:47:49,610 --> 01:47:50,610
Ma plant the seeds for the vegetables.

1592
01:47:50,610 --> 01:47:51,610
They were all so happy because spring had
come.

1593
01:47:51,610 --> 01:47:52,610
'Soon we'll have vegetables to eat and we'll
live like kings!'

1594
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:53,610
Pa said.

1595
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:54,610
One day Mary and Laura were washing dishes
in the house when they heard Pa's voice, loud

1596
01:47:54,610 --> 01:47:55,610
and angry.

1597
01:47:55,610 --> 01:47:56,610
They looked out and saw Mr Edwards and Mr
Scott in the field with Pa.

1598
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:57,610
'No, Scott!' said Pa.

1599
01:47:57,610 --> 01:47:58,610
'I won't stay here until the soldiers take
me away like a criminal.

1600
01:47:58,610 --> 01:47:59,610
The government in Washington told us it was
all right to build our houses here.

1601
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:00,610
But if now they want us to go, we'll go.

1602
01:48:00,610 --> 01:48:01,610
We won't wait for the soldiers to make us
leave.

1603
01:48:01,610 --> 01:48:02,610
We're going now!'

1604
01:48:02,610 --> 01:48:03,610
'What's the matter, Charles?

1605
01:48:03,610 --> 01:48:04,610
Where are we going?'

1606
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:05,610
Ma asked.

1607
01:48:05,610 --> 01:48:06,610
'I don't know, Caroline!

1608
01:48:06,610 --> 01:48:07,610
But we're going.

1609
01:48:07,610 --> 01:48:08,610
We're leaving here,' Pa said.

1610
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:09,610
'Scott and Edwards say the government is sending
soldiers to make the settlers leave Indian

1611
01:48:09,610 --> 01:48:10,610
Territory.'

1612
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:11,610
His face was very red and his eyes were like
blue fire.

1613
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:12,610
Laura was frightened; she had never seen Pa
look like that.

1614
01:48:12,610 --> 01:48:13,610
'I'm going, too,' said Mr Edwards.

1615
01:48:13,610 --> 01:48:14,610
'Take the cow and the calf,' Pa said to Mr
Scott.

1616
01:48:14,610 --> 01:48:15,610
'You've been a good neighbour, and I'm sorry
to leave you.

1617
01:48:15,610 --> 01:48:16,610
But we're going in the morning.'

1618
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:17,610
After Mr Scott left with the animals, Mr Edwards
and Pa shook hands and said goodbye.

1619
01:48:17,610 --> 01:48:18,610
Then he shook hands with Ma and said.

1620
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:19,610
'Goodbye, Mrs Ingalls.

1621
01:48:19,610 --> 01:48:20,610
I'll never forget how kind you were to me.'

1622
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:21,610
Mary said politely, 'Goodbye, Mr Edwards.'

1623
01:48:21,610 --> 01:48:22,610
But Laura forgot to be polite.

1624
01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:23,610
She said, 'Oh, Mr Edwards, please don't go
away!

1625
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:24,610
Oh, Mr Edwards, thank you, thank you for going
all the way to Independence to find Santa

1626
01:48:24,610 --> 01:48:25,610
Claus for us.'

1627
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:26,610
Mr Edwards eyes shone very bright, and he
went away without saying another word.

1628
01:48:26,610 --> 01:48:27,610
Pa began to put the canvas cover on the wagon
and Laura and Mary knew it was true; they

1629
01:48:27,610 --> 01:48:28,610
really were going away.

1630
01:48:28,610 --> 01:48:29,610
Everyone was quiet that night.

1631
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:30,610
Ma looked sad and said gently, 'A year gone.

1632
01:48:30,610 --> 01:48:31,610
Charles.'

1633
01:48:31,610 --> 01:48:32,610
But Pa answered with a smile, 'What's a year?

1634
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:33,610
We have all the time in the world.'

1635
01:48:33,610 --> 01:48:34,610
The next morning, Pa and Ma packed the wagon.

1636
01:48:34,610 --> 01:48:35,610
First Ma laid two beds across the back of
the wagon.

1637
01:48:35,610 --> 01:48:36,610
Then she and Pa packed the clothes, the food,
and the dishes.

1638
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:37,610
The only thing they could not take was the
plough.

1639
01:48:37,610 --> 01:48:38,610
Laura and Mary climbed into the wagon and
sat on the bed in the back.

1640
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:39,610
Ma put Baby Carrie between them.

1641
01:48:39,610 --> 01:48:40,610
Ma climbed to her place on the seat.

1642
01:48:40,610 --> 01:48:41,610
Then suddenly Laura wanted to see the house
again.

1643
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:42,610
So Pa opened the back of the wagon cover,
and Mary and Laura looked out at their little

1644
01:48:42,610 --> 01:48:43,610
log house.

1645
01:48:43,610 --> 01:48:44,610
Pa climbed to his place beside Ma and took
the reins in his hands.

1646
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:45,610
Jack went under the wagon, and Pet and Patty
walked away from the little house on the prairie.

1647
01:48:45,610 --> 01:48:46,610
As far as they could see, to the east and
to the south and to the west, nothing was

1648
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:47,610
moving.

1649
01:48:47,610 --> 01:48:48,610
Only the green grass was waving in the wind.

1650
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:49,610
'It's a great country, Caroline,' Pa said.

1651
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:50,610
'But there will be wild Indians and wolves
here for many years.'

1652
01:48:50,610 --> 01:48:51,610
Pa and Ma were still and silent, and Mary
and Laura were quiet, too.

1653
01:48:51,610 --> 01:48:52,610
But Laura felt all excited inside.

1654
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:53,610
You never know what will happen next, nor
where you will be tomorrow, when you are travelling

1655
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:54,610
in a covered wagon.

1656
01:48:54,610 --> 01:48:54,612
- THE END -
