00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:12,219
CHAPTER ONE
New York in the spring

2
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:15,270
It was a fine but chilly spring morning.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:21,120
Fine enough even to make the New York borough
of Queens seem attractive.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,740
Like any other day, I left my apartment on
Main Street, Queens, and walked to the subway

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,739
station to commute into midtown Manhattan
on the number seven train.

6
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:39,579
Like any other day, I read the New York Daily
News to pass the time during the journey.

7
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:45,460
Out of professional interest, I always glance
through the day's fresh crime stories.

8
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:53,960
Muggings, thefts, a car-jacking, a shooting,
a bank robbery, and so on.

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,370
Crime - the unpleasant reality of life from
which I make my living.

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:06,640
The name's Marley, Nat Marley, licensed private
investigator.

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,590
My prediction is that you already have a mental
image of my type of work.

12
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,070
I can safely bet that your image comes straight
from the fantasy world of Hollywood.

13
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,090
That's a long way from the truth.

14
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,170
The majority of my work is dull.

15
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:32,159
Often just pure routine stuff like divorce,
bad debts, or missing persons.

16
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,240
Don't imagine for a moment that I'm good-looking
either.

17
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:44,850
Just an ordinary-looking guy, bald, overweight
and on the wrong side of forty.

18
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,229
And let's get another thing straight, my working
days seldom start with a wealthy, attractive

19
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:57,160
female client anxiously waiting for my professional
services.

20
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:04,929
My office is on East 43rd Street, just a couple
of blocks from Grand Central Station.

21
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:12,080
Stella Delgado, my personal assistant was
already at her desk talking on the phone.

22
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,252
Stella's been with me most of the time I've
been in business.

23
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:20,860
A beautiful, intelligent Puerto Rican in her
late twenties.

24
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,600
If she wanted, she could get a far better
job elsewhere.

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,280
And I've told her that too.

26
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,550
But she insists on working for me; she must
like me.

27
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:39,280
You've heard of the expression 'on the wrong
side of the tracks', meaning the poor, underprivileged

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,190
areas of the inner city?

29
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:49,700
That's where Stella grew up, in the Barrio
on the Upper East Side, known as Spanish Harlem.

30
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,400
She had left school early and got into plenty
of trouble as a kid.

31
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,560
Then it took years of night school study to
catch up on her education.

32
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:08,060
As she put down the phone, I asked, "How are
things on this beautiful spring morning?"

33
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,670
Silence.

34
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,020
She just gave me a blank stare.

35
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,210
The morning mail was on her desk, unopened.

36
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,840
Something was definitely wrong.

37
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,110
"Stella, what's the matter?

38
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,310
Come on, out with it."

39
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,400
She looked up at me tearfully.

40
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,750
"Nat, I don't know what to do.

41
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,950
It's family - my kid brother, Jose.

42
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,060
I've just been talking to him on the phone.

43
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,760
He's been arrested.

44
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,200
He could be in serious trouble."

45
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,230
There was work to catch up with that morning,
bills to send out to our satisfied or dissatisfied

46
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,650
clients, and some annoying letters from the
IRS, the tax people.

47
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,710
Yet again, they'd claimed I hadn't paid enough
tax.

48
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,290
But clients and the IRS would have to wait.

49
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,390
"Stella, tell me everything."

50
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,320
"It's a long story.

51
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,340
Jose was found by the police in the early
hours of this morning on 112th Street just

52
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,320
off Lexington Avenue, Upper East Side.

53
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,250
He was lying unconscious with head injuries,
in the driver's seat of a car that had crashed

54
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,580
into a wall in a parking lot.

55
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,629
Nat, he doesn't even own a car.

56
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,870
Anyway, he was taken to the emergency room
at Metropolitan Hospital.

57
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,090
Now he's in a secure room under police guard.

58
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,620
He was allowed to make one phone call, so
he called me."

59
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,990
"So what's the story?

60
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,699
How did he get into this mess?"

61
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,139
I asked.

62
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:58,740
"The awful thing is he has no memory of what
he was doing," Stella said.

63
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:05,509
"All he can remember is being at some bar
in Brighton Beach with his buddies yesterday

64
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:06,509
evening.

65
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,360
Then nothing."

66
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,069
"Has he been charged with anything?"

67
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:12,319
I asked.

68
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,569
"No.

69
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:17,770
At least, not as far as I know," replied Stella.

70
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:23,340
"Why were Jose and his buddies going out for
a drink at Brighton Beach, anyway?

71
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,580
That's quite a way from Spanish Harlem for
a night out."

72
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,220
"Jose works in the summer at a diner on Surf
Avenue, Coney Island.

73
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,349
The place closes up in the winter.

74
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:41,569
Jose had been to see his boss to confirm his
job for next summer.

75
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:46,400
He got some good news - they took him on as
a cook.

76
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,060
Jose had taken a couple of his buddies along
to see if he could fix up work for them.

77
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,379
They were taken on as waiters.

78
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:59,860
Good money, plus room and board, starting
first of April.

79
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,409
Afterwards, they went out to celebrate."

80
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:09,729
The thought of Coney Island brought back some
of those golden childhood memories: trips

81
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:17,349
to Coney Island beach and the rides at the
amusement park, family vacations at the beach.

82
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:24,199
I put those thoughts to the back of my mind
and concentrated on Stella's story.

83
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,939
"Anything more?"

84
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:27,009
I asked.

85
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:34,499
"He said he had just a vague memory of a bar
somewhere on Brighton Beach Avenue.

86
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:37,910
He knew he'd had a few too many drinks.

87
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,249
Then nothing until he woke up in a hospital
bed."

88
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:45,580
"Maybe he's in shock," I suggested.

89
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,300
"Temporary memory loss.

90
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,490
If this was a simple case of drunk-driving,
he wouldn't be under police guard.

91
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,789
And where did he get the car from?"

92
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,229
"I don't know, Nat.

93
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:03,169
Jose's never had a driver's license."

94
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:09,259
Not having a driver's license didn't mean
he hadn't stolen the car and driven it anyway.

95
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:12,379
But I didn't say that to Stella.

96
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,520
I thought for a moment.

97
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:21,110
If Jose hadn't been charged with any offense,
the NYPD could only hold him for a limited

98
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,110
time.

99
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,939
"All right, Stella.

100
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:26,180
This is what we'll do.

101
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:32,990
If Jose hasn't been formally charged, there's
no reason why we shouldn't be allowed to visit.

102
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,520
We're going straight over to the hospital
to talk with him."

103
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,840
Stella didn't move but just stood by her desk,
biting her lip.

104
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,099
"Is something else bothering you?"

105
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:46,389
I asked.

106
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:49,930
"Nat, I'm worried sick.

107
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,160
Jose's an ordinary loveable guy who likes
a good time.

108
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,990
OK, he's got a criminal record.

109
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,029
He got into some trouble when he was a teenager.

110
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:02,979
But I know he's harmless.

111
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:05,659
A danger to nobody.

112
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,439
But someone with his background...

113
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:12,819
you know as well as I do what conclusion the
police will come to."

114
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:15,680
"Come on, Stella," I said.

115
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,710
"Things have changed in this city.

116
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,530
It's not like the bad old days.

117
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:28,069
You know how sensitive the police are nowadays
about any question of possible prejudice.

118
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:34,729
You can't assume that the NYPD will think
Jose is guilty because of his background.

119
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,470
Any suspect has to be judged on the evidence."

120
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:43,130
"Maybe you're right," she replied, simply.

121
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,650
Stella didn't seem to be convinced.

122
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:52,330
But I knew the NYPD would go to any lengths
to avoid the kind of publicity an accusation

123
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,080
of racial prejudice would attract.

124
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,160
I also understood Stella's fears.

125
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,520
Stella and her family are Puerto Rican.

126
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:08,560
During the 1950s tens of thousands of Puerto
Ricans emigrated from their island to the

127
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,510
U.S.A.

128
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:16,190
When they arrived, some of them discovered
that the U.S.A. wasn't the land of opportunity

129
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,240
they'd expected.

130
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,450
Some had exchanged the poverty of Puerto Rico
for the poor neighborhoods of New York.

131
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:30,760
There were dead-end jobs waiting for them
as kitchen hands or unskilled factory workers.

132
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:38,350
Today, however, some have succeeded in creating
a good life - like Stella, with a permanent

133
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,990
job, comfortable apartment, and loving husband.

134
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,380
But for Stella it had been a struggle.

135
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,960
I could appreciate how her culture and background
might affect the way she saw things.

136
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:59,120
"Lock up the office and let's go," I said.

137
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,380
CHAPTER TWO
Metropolitan Hospital

138
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,640
After a few inquiries at the main reception
desk, we were finally given the location of

139
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Jose's room at the hospital.

140
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,060
Eventually, when we reached the floor, it
was obvious that gaining access would be no

141
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,330
simple matter.

142
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,740
There was a bored-looking police officer sitting
outside.

143
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,070
I thought I might start with a little gentle
persuasion.

144
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,880
It can sometimes work, even on police officers.

145
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,330
I should know - I used to be an NYPD officer
before I set up my own business.

146
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:44,890
"Excuse me," I said, showing the officer my
investigator's license.

147
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,280
"I represent Mr. Jose De La Cruz.

148
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,010
Would it be possible to speak to him?

149
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:57,580
The lady here is Ms. Delgado, sister of Mr.
De La Cruz."

150
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,290
The officer was unimpressed.

151
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,450
He looked me up and down and said flatly,
"Sorry, sir.

152
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,440
No one's allowed in.

153
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,230
And that's official."

154
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,850
I wondered if he was going to be one of those
people who get their job satisfaction by creating

155
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,480
difficulties for others.

156
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,850
I wasn't going to take 'no' as the final answer.

157
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,000
"Come on, now.

158
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,380
Just a quick word.

159
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,070
Won't do any harm."

160
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,680
"No," replied the officer sharply.

161
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,140
"This guy's a suspect.

162
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,480
He's wanted for questioning."

163
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,630
"Suspected of doing what?"

164
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,630
I demanded.

165
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,800
"Has he been charged with any crime?"

166
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,650
"Don't know, and no."

167
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,430
"Thanks for all your co-operation.

168
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,060
Give me the name of your boss, will you?"

169
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,120
I asked.

170
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,930
It was Captain Oldenberg.

171
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,190
A familiar name.

172
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,250
Oldenberg and I had worked together at the
NYPD.

173
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,640
That was over fifteen years ago, when we'd
both been patrolmen on the streets of the

174
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,350
Lower East Side.

175
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:14,670
Since I'd left the NYPD to become a private
eye, Oldenberg had risen through the ranks

176
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,400
and had now been promoted to captain.

177
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,760
Every now and then our professional paths
crossed.

178
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,030
Oldenberg was the sort of guy you didn't forget
in a hurry.

179
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:32,810
He could be bad- tempered, loud, and dominating
at times.

180
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,580
Despite that, he was basically a good cop.

181
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,470
I'd need all my charm to deal with him, though.

182
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,470
"Thanks.

183
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,850
I'll be back," I said.

184
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,000
Stella was looking furious.

185
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,410
"Nat!

186
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,930
Exactly what is going on here?"

187
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,570
she demanded as we walked away from the room.

188
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:58,500
"Are you just going to take 'no' for an answer?"

189
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,480
"Stay calm, Stella.

190
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,170
In this situation we need friends, not enemies.

191
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,670
I'll call Oldenberg."

192
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,060
I phoned police headquarters and was put through
to Oldenberg's office.

193
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,730
He wasn't exactly pleased to hear from me.

194
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,330
That was normal.

195
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:24,360
He was even less pleased when I asked if Jose
was free to leave once the doctors had given

196
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,270
him the all clear.

197
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,230
"You've got to be joking, Marley!" he shouted.

198
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:35,470
"There's no way I'm going to let that guy
out on the streets.

199
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,370
He's being held on 'reasonable suspicion'.

200
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:44,840
I've had a crime scene team examining the
car De La Cruz was found in, and I'm waiting

201
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,920
for the results of forensic tests."

202
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,730
Tests to examine what?

203
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,620
Bloodstains on clothes?

204
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,620
DNA?

205
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,510
A weapon?

206
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,190
I tried my charm on Oldenberg again.

207
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,110
"I'd be interested to know what those tests
would be for," I said.

208
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,720
"Sure you would.

209
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:15,250
Marley, you know I can't reveal any details
of evidence until the suspect has been charged."

210
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,220
It was the answer I'd been expecting.

211
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,270
No harm in having another try.

212
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,950
"Have you established who was the owner of
the vehicle?"

213
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,120
I asked hopefully.

214
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,040
"Same as my previous answer," he replied bluntly.

215
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,530
I got the impression that the captain was
enjoying himself.

216
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,360
One last attempt to make some progress.

217
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,700
"OK, Oldenberg.

218
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,800
I know your position.

219
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,200
Rules have to be obeyed.

220
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,190
But if my client hasn't been charged, why
can't I speak to him?

221
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,980
I have his sister with me and she's upset
in a big way.

222
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,500
Just ten minutes?

223
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,010
And I'll agree to the police officer being
present too."

224
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,620
"All right, Marley.

225
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,540
Have your ten minutes.

226
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,720
I'll call the officer and tell him to expect
you."

227
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,500
We hurried back to speak to Jose.

228
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,950
The officer showed us into his room.

229
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:20,940
Jose was sitting up in bed, with a bandage
around his head and an IV drip attached to

230
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,930
his arm.

231
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,990
There was a hopeless expression on his face.

232
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:32,080
Stella went over to him, took his hand, and
spoke to him gently.

233
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,110
"How are you feeling, Jose?"

234
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,329
"Not great.

235
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:44,230
I'm full of painkillers, but I can still feel
my head spinning," said Jose.

236
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,471
"Stella, it's real good to see you.

237
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:50,180
Are you going to get me out of here?

238
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,780
I haven't done anything wrong."

239
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:57,260
"You and I both know you haven't done anything
wrong," she said.

240
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,490
"Remember what I told you, Jose.

241
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,540
You've got to keep holding on."

242
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:09,850
"So what's the cop doing here, huh?" asked
Jose, glancing in the direction of the officer.

243
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,930
"We had to agree to the officer being present.

244
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,010
Jose, this is my boss, Nat Marley.

245
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,760
He's going to help you."

246
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,810
"I'm sure glad to see you, Nat," said Jose.

247
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:29,160
"If we're going to help you, you've got to
give us the whole story.

248
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,710
Don't hold anything back."

249
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,950
I said.

250
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:37,190
"Everything that happened from the time you
left home yesterday until you woke up in this

251
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,190
hospital bed."

252
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:47,320
Jose, with his two friends, Miguel and Carlos,
took the subway to Coney Island to find work.

253
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:53,570
The boss at the diner offered him a job as
a cook and Jose's buddies were taken on as

254
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,360
waiters.

255
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,530
Jose showed Miguel and Carlos around the sights
of Coney Island during the afternoon.

256
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:06,169
After stopping for food, they moved on to
Brighton Beach to celebrate.

257
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:13,089
By early evening they'd had several drinks
in bars on Brighton Beach Avenue, in the heart

258
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,620
of the Russian community.

259
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,760
He had a confused memory of waking up in a
bar.

260
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,169
His buddies had gone.

261
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:24,249
Then nothing.

262
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:28,929
The next thing he remembered was waking up
in Metropolitan Hospital.

263
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,970
"You don't remember anything else?"

264
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,070
I asked.

265
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,070
"Nothing.

266
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,990
It's the honest truth, Nat," said Jose.

267
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,370
"It's all a black fog."

268
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,820
"Brighton Beach?

269
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:48,090
Kind of an unusual night out for three guys
from Upper Manhattan, huh?"

270
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,130
I asked.

271
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,220
"You're right.

272
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:58,149
At first it felt kind of strange for us to
be there," said Jose, "but people were nice

273
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:02,279
and didn't mind three outsiders having a night
out.

274
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,490
One bartender got friendly when we asked him
about all the different vodkas."

275
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,940
"Now think hard, Jose.

276
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,030
Can you remember anything else?"

277
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,159
I asked.

278
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,029
"Nothing," he replied.

279
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,169
"What happened to Miguel and Carlos?"

280
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:23,710
"I can't remember."

281
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,360
It didn't look good.

282
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,760
Jose had been found unconscious at the wheel
of a car that wasn't his.

283
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:37,140
He had no memory of what had happened after
passing out in a Brighton Beach bar.

284
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,690
"Jose, I know you don't have a driver's license,
but can you drive?"

285
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,690
I asked.

286
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,749
"No way, Nat.

287
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,690
I've never tried.

288
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,700
And even if I could, I'd have been too drunk
to drive."

289
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,929
The police officer interrupted us: "Time's
up, Mr. Marley."

290
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,540
There wasn't any point in asking for more
time.

291
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,429
I didn't think we were going to learn anything
more of value.

292
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:12,419
As to what had actually happened, it was still
a complete mystery.

293
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:17,610
Was Jose the victim or was he the guilty party?

294
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:24,330
My impression of him from our brief talk was
of a harmless ordinary guy; a guy who had

295
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:30,559
gotten into some sort of trouble and had no
explanation for what had happened.

296
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,830
It wasn't looking good.

297
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:38,350
There was some small hope though, since I'd
gotten clients out of worse situations than

298
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,940
this.

299
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:47,850
Jose needed a lawyer, urgently, and I knew
just the woman for the job: Lena Rosenthal.

300
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:56,019
She was capable, intelligent, and tough; someone
who could stand up to Oldenberg.

301
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:01,090
As soon as Jose was charged with a crime,
then we would have something concrete from

302
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,840
the NYPD.

303
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,169
Otherwise, we were just operating in the dark.

304
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:13,279
Stella had to get back to her family, so I
gave her the rest of the day off.

305
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,779
I just wished I could say something that might
give her some comfort.

306
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:21,539
But I knew whatever I said would be inadequate.

307
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:28,970
Once I had more information, then I might
be able to offer her some hope.

308
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,590
The next day, the temperature was close to
freezing.

309
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:39,289
A layer of frost covered the windows of cars
parked on the street overnight.

310
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:44,659
I'd arrived at the office early and was just
putting the breakfast coffee and donuts down

311
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,440
on the desk when the phone rang.

312
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,000
A familiar voice barked at me - Captain Oldenberg.

313
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,809
"Marley?

314
00:20:54,809 --> 00:21:01,659
Just calling to tell you that your client
De La Cruz is still being held at the hospital.

315
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:07,549
I wanted to get him moved to headquarters
for further questioning, but the doctors insisted

316
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:10,460
he be kept under observation.

317
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:16,809
I'm still waiting for the results of the tests
on bloodstains found on his jacket and a wallet

318
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,749
in his possession."

319
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:23,559
Oldenberg had given away a few more details.

320
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,600
Bloodstains?

321
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,519
Things were getting more serious.

322
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:34,059
In desperation I said: "Oldenberg, my client
can't drive.

323
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:39,539
And what's more, the alcohol level from the
blood tests should indicate he'd have been

324
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,539
incapable of driving anyway."

325
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:46,840
"Marley, don't make me laugh," he replied.

326
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,130
"My client needs to consult his lawyer.

327
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:54,649
With your permission, I'd like to take her
over to the hospital this morning.

328
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,070
Any objections?"

329
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,919
"Be my guest, Marley.

330
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:04,070
I'll call the officer on duty and tell him
to expect you."

331
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,840
By now Stella had arrived.

332
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,740
I told her the latest developments.

333
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:16,230
She took it all in silently then sat in front
of her computer with her head in her hands.

334
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,629
I arranged to pick up Lena Rosenthal.

335
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:26,419
Later, as our cab headed up First Avenue towards
the hospital, I gave Lena all the details

336
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:28,990
she needed about Jose's case.

337
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,640
I also explained how I was involved.

338
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,360
"Lena, this isn't just a routine case for
me.

339
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,350
This guy's the kid brother of my assistant,
Stella Delgado.

340
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,899
Stella's been working for me so long that
she's like part of my family.

341
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:51,289
I feel responsible for both Stella and Jose.

342
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:55,700
You could say it's personal this time."

343
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,730
Lena nodded.

344
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,320
"Thanks for telling me, Nat.

345
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,090
Anything else I should know?"

346
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:05,080
"I should warn you about Captain Oldenberg.

347
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,580
He has a reputation for being aggressive and
insensitive."

348
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,749
"Oldenberg and I have met before.

349
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:17,230
I know what to expect," replied Lena.

350
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,409
At the hospital, before we saw Jose, a doctor
took us aside.

351
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:24,090
"Excuse me.

352
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,539
Are you family?"

353
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:26,890
she asked.

354
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,110
"We represent Mr. De La Cruz.

355
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:35,039
The name's Nat Marley, private investigator,"
I replied, flashing my I.D.

356
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,419
at the doctor.

357
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,769
"This is his lawyer Ms. Rosenthal.

358
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:43,269
We have permission from the NYPD to visit
our client."

359
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:45,620
"Thank you.

360
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,730
I'm Dr. Ericson.

361
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,470
Mr. De La Cruz has been under my care since
he was admitted.

362
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,340
His condition has been giving me cause for
concern.

363
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,270
In the accident, he received a heavy blow
to the head.

364
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:08,159
So far his condition has been stable, but
there have been some symptoms that worry me.

365
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,230
He's complained about seeing double images
and he has twice lost consciousness, though

366
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,450
very briefly.

367
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,629
And also there's some memory loss.

368
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:25,879
So, I must warn you not to put Mr. De La Cruz
under any unnecessary stress.

369
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:30,610
He's been through enough already, and with
any further stress..."

370
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,879
"Understood, Doctor.

371
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:34,809
We'll take great care."

372
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:38,070
Before seeing Jose, Lena turned to me.

373
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:44,320
"It would be a good idea not to mention anything
about the forensic tests.

374
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,509
This guy sounds scared enough already."

375
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:51,039
I nodded my agreement.

376
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,149
Eventually we were allowed in to speak to
Jose.

377
00:24:55,149 --> 00:25:00,480
He looked at us with dull eyes and raised
a hand to acknowledge us.

378
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,350
I could see the despair in his eyes.

379
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,900
Lena went over exactly the same questions
as I had asked before.

380
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,330
There was nothing more that Jose could add.

381
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,039
We had made no further progress.

382
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:26,340
As we were leaving, Jose cried out hopelessly:
"Nat, for God's sake, get me out of here!

383
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:32,409
I'm going out of my mind."

384
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:37,259
CHAPTER THREE
Jones Beach

385
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:40,610
Saturday morning was cold but bright.

386
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,200
I was feeling fit and active.

387
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,559
I started the day by following my Saturday
routine.

388
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:55,820
Buying the Daily News and wandering down Main
Street, Queens, to Slim Pete's Diner.

389
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:02,470
Breakfast there was always reliable - unhealthy
but very tasty.

390
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,640
Maybe that explained 'Slim' Pete's weight
problem.

391
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,320
"Morning, Nat," said Slim Pete.

392
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,659
"Why so cheerful?"

393
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:19,960
"Pete, I now realize that a healthy lifestyle
is no solution to a mid-life crisis - which

394
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:26,390
means I'll have one of your breakfast specials
and plenty of coffee."

395
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:31,950
As I worked my way through breakfast, I looked
through the Daily News.

396
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,879
There was a story about a murder victim.

397
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:39,350
A guy by the name of Alexei Romanov.

398
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:43,250
Where had I heard the name 'Romanov' before?

399
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,929
That was it, the old Russian royal family.

400
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:54,669
The body had been found late Friday afternoon,
floating in Coney Island Creek.

401
00:26:54,669 --> 00:27:01,260
The victim had been shot in the head and had
been dead for over twenty-four hours.

402
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,480
There were some more details.

403
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,429
Romanov owned some kind of business on Brighton
Beach.

404
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:14,460
He was involved in a society that helped immigrants
from Russia to settle and adapt to life in

405
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,799
the U.S.A.

406
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,980
His tearful widow told reporters that she
had no idea who could have done such a thing.

407
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:30,779
He seemed to have been a well-liked and respected
man who was active in the community.

408
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:36,429
I hoped and prayed there was no connection
with Jose.

409
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:38,820
Another story caught my eye.

410
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,610
The headline read: 'Wreck on Jones Beach'.

411
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,919
Part of a lifeboat had been washed up on the
shore.

412
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,659
Two bodies had been found nearby.

413
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:53,490
No further details.

414
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,419
I'd been brought up on Staten Island.

415
00:27:56,419 --> 00:28:03,259
As a kid, just taking the ferry across to
Manhattan seemed like a big adventure.

416
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:11,350
A day out on Coney Island was a real trip,
but Jones Beach, on Long Island, felt like

417
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,299
going abroad.

418
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:18,330
Maybe there's something of that kid still
left inside me.

419
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:24,799
I still get a thrill when I get way out of
the city and stand on the beach looking out

420
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,690
at the Atlantic, watching the waves crashing.

421
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,889
Why not escape from the city for the day?

422
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:36,320
The ocean air would do me good.

423
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,799
I was folding up the newspaper when Slim Pete
came over to chat.

424
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:46,110
"So what's New York's smartest private eye
doing?

425
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:49,659
Putting more gangsters behind bars?" he asked.

426
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:53,049
"Funny you should say that," I answered.

427
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:56,600
"New York's criminal community can relax.

428
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,759
I've just decided I'm going to spend a day
at the beach."

429
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:01,759
"Huh!

430
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,460
A life of leisure.

431
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,570
It's all right for some people."

432
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:12,029
I took the bus from Main Street, to Jamaica
Station.

433
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:16,989
You can connect there with the Long Island
Rail Road to Freeport.

434
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:23,769
From there, I took a cab to Jones Beach, a
long narrow strip of land about two miles

435
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:26,220
from the mainland.

436
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,480
There was a real chill in the wind coming
in off the ocean.

437
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,039
Enough to keep any crowds away so early in
the year.

438
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,830
In the height of the season, thousands of
New Yorkers crowd into the area to claim their

439
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,610
little piece of beach.

440
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:50,429
But today I could walk without tripping over
beach towels or bumping into umbrellas.

441
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:55,950
I strolled along the shore for about an hour,
then returned.

442
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,570
Unusually energetic for me, but I felt better
afterwards.

443
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,630
The air was clean and fresh.

444
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:10,710
Then I stood for a while on the Atlantic side,
watching the waves crash onto the beach.

445
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,260
I knew why I had really come here.

446
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,519
It was the reports of the bodies washed up
on the beach.

447
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,970
It was my day off, but I was still playing
the investigator.

448
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,980
That was why my marriage had broken up.

449
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,970
My wife never saw much of me when I was with
the NYPD.

450
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:38,720
When I started out on my own as a private
investigator she saw even less of me.

451
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,480
Then one day she walked out on me.

452
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,450
She left a note which said that I just didn't
give her enough attention and she couldn't

453
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,070
carry on like that.

454
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,110
The sad truth was she was right.

455
00:30:55,110 --> 00:31:01,200
If there's ever a second Mrs. Marley, she'll
have to be one very tolerant lady to put up

456
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,429
with me.

457
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:09,299
I wandered over to a group of bars and restaurants
which would be packed with visitors in a few

458
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:10,299
weeks.

459
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:17,320
One or two were already open, while in others
work was going on in preparation for the coming

460
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,779
season.

461
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:24,249
Outside a bar an old guy up on a ladder was
painting.

462
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,700
He looked down at me from his work.

463
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,890
"You're out of luck if you want a drink, mister.

464
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:35,019
We don't open till the first of April," he
said.

465
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:40,610
"Just wanted to talk if it's not holding you
up," I replied.

466
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,539
"Go ahead and talk, mister.

467
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:46,229
I'm just doing this as a favor for my son-in-law.

468
00:31:46,229 --> 00:31:50,460
He doesn't care how slowly I work."

469
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,979
"I see Jones Beach has been in the news.

470
00:31:54,979 --> 00:32:02,409
Some story about a lifeboat found wrecked
along the shore and two bodies," I said.

471
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:05,259
The old man came down from the ladder.

472
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:06,820
A good sign.

473
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,320
I had got his interest.

474
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,989
He pointed west along the shore with a dripping
paintbrush.

475
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:20,149
"The wrecked lifeboat was found about a mile
west along the beach.

476
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:26,340
There's an old lady - when I say old, she's
a good ten years older than me.

477
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,980
Well, she goes beachcombing regularly.

478
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,720
You know, looking for shells and stuff.

479
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,270
She found the wreck and the bodies."

480
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,570
"Really!

481
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,809
Must have been quite a shock for her," I said.

482
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:43,840
"I don't know about that, mister.

483
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,720
It made her day.

484
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,320
Never seen her so excited."

485
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,820
It was time to make my move.

486
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,889
I showed him my investigator's license.

487
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:55,889
"Gee!

488
00:32:55,889 --> 00:32:58,769
A real private eye!"

489
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,249
exclaimed the old man.

490
00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:03,210
"I would've expected someone..."

491
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,049
"Someone younger and better-looking?"

492
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,890
I interrupted.

493
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,529
"We come in all shapes and sizes.

494
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:15,479
Look, I'm investigating this wreck for a client,"
I lied.

495
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,870
"I'd like to talk to this lady.

496
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,130
Who is she, and where can I find her?"

497
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,809
"Her name's Edith Tilden.

498
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:26,490
People call her 'Edie'.

499
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:30,440
She's English, but she's lived here for years.

500
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,509
She looks kind of eccentric, but she's OK
once you get talking.

501
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:38,970
See that place over there?"

502
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:45,340
The old man pointed toward a beat-up building
with the sign 'Ornella's Italian Clam House'

503
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,220
above the entrance.

504
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,269
"She'll probably be in there," he continued.

505
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:57,299
"She claims Ornella's the only person on Jones
Beach who can make a good cup of tea."

506
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:01,509
Life's full of surprises.

507
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:05,289
Since when did Italians make good tea?

508
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:06,840
I entered the restaurant.

509
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,290
It didn't look open for business.

510
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,400
Most of the tables and chairs were piled up
in a corner.

511
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,770
Only a handful of tables were set.

512
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:24,790
At one of the tables sat a little old lady
dressed in bright yellow and purple.

513
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,159
A plump, cheerful woman welcomed me.

514
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,280
"Morning, mister.

515
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,119
No hot food until April.

516
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:34,929
Just snacks and hot and cold drinks."

517
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:36,169
she said.

518
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:40,339
"I was looking for a sandwich and a cup of
tea.

519
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:46,179
I've been told that you make the best tea
in Jones Beach," I replied.

520
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:52,740
The old woman at the table looked up and said,
"You've come to the right place for tea."

521
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:58,200
"Then make that two teas - one for the lady
here."

522
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,250
I went over to her table.

523
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,079
"Mind if I join you?"

524
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,079
I asked.

525
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:05,809
"Not at all," she answered.

526
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:08,099
"Take a seat."

527
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:10,839
I noticed the way she spoke.

528
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:14,119
Not the slightest American accent.

529
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,510
"Thanks.

530
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,510
You English?"

531
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,690
I asked.

532
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,060
"I'm probably as American as you are, now.

533
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:28,329
I've been in the U.S.A. for fifty years but
never lost the accent or the tea-drinking

534
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:29,329
habit.

535
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:31,089
The name's Edie, Edie Tilden."

536
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:34,220
"Pleased to meet you.

537
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,500
I'm Nat Marley."

538
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,609
The sandwich and teas were brought over to
the table.

539
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:46,849
After small talk about the weather, it was
time to get some information.

540
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:50,340
I showed Edie my private investigator's license.

541
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:56,160
Her eyes grew large and round and her mouth
dropped open.

542
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,089
This old lady was deeply impressed.

543
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:02,410
I wish I had that effect on people more often.

544
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:08,230
"I hear you found the wrecked lifeboat and
two bodies on the beach.

545
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:13,000
I'm investigating the wreck for a client,"
I lied again.

546
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,010
Edie waved her teaspoon at me excitedly.

547
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:22,900
"Mr. Marley, I've been walking up and down
this beach for years.

548
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:28,859
I've found bits and pieces of boats, but never
a body.

549
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:32,030
Two real dead bodies!

550
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,640
What do you say to that?"

551
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,760
she asked.

552
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,539
"Must have been a terrible shock," I said.

553
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:42,660
"People don't look pretty after they've been
in the sea."

554
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,339
"Can you describe them?"

555
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:46,650
I asked.

556
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,760
"Certainly.

557
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,609
Two young men, could be anywhere in their
twenties.

558
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,190
Medium height.

559
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,190
Thin.

560
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:59,460
Both of them looked as if they needed a good
meal.

561
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,809
Short hair.

562
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:03,210
They hadn't shaved for days.

563
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,490
Cheap-looking clothes.

564
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:10,450
One of them had a gold cross on a chain around
his neck.

565
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,910
I've never seen one like it before.

566
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,520
Let me show you."

567
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:22,349
She paused, took a clean paper napkin from
the table, found a pencil in her pocket, and

568
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:28,880
drew a picture of a cross with two horizontal
bars, the top one a little shorter.

569
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,920
Then at the base of the cross, a short bar
at a forty-five degree angle.

570
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,670
I didn't recognize it.

571
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,020
"Thanks.

572
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,460
Mind if I keep this?"

573
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,620
I asked.

574
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,410
"Now what can you remember about the boat?"

575
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:50,220
"What I found was the rear half.

576
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,650
Probably from a boat big enough to fit a dozen
people in.

577
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,790
It had seen better days, though."

578
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,150
"What do you mean?"

579
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,760
"The wood was rotten with age.

580
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:09,099
Some of it was so soft I could break off pieces
with my bare hands.

581
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:15,960
It looked like someone had been trying to
repair it, but hadn't made a good job of it.

582
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,809
The boat must have split in two."

583
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:22,390
"Were there any identifying marks?

584
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,369
Like names or numbers?"

585
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,369
I asked.

586
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:31,480
"Some letters at the back, maybe the boat's
name," Edie answered.

587
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:38,440
"I couldn't make out a complete word, but
it looked like a foreign language.

588
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,119
And that's about all I can tell you.

589
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,140
The Coast Guard took it away so there's nothing
to see now.

590
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,539
"Thanks.

591
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:49,140
You've been very helpful.

592
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,420
Here's my card.

593
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,369
Where can I contact you if I need to speak
to you again?"

594
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:00,260
She wrote a Freeport address and phone number
on the paper.

595
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:04,690
I left Edie and did some more beach walking.

596
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:10,910
I felt relaxed and content when I finally
got back to Queens that evening.

597
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,089
But there was still the problem of Jose.

598
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:21,730
Unless I turned up some new evidence soon,
he could be facing a long prison sentence.

599
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,819
The next day I woke up early but was feeling
active.

600
00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:31,780
It must have been the effect of all that exercise
the day before.

601
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,210
There are various ways to spend your Sunday.

602
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:40,610
Unfortunately, I had to go into the office
to sort out some accounts.

603
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:45,720
On the subway, I glanced through the Sunday
edition of the Daily News.

604
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:50,730
It didn't have anything to add to yesterday's
stories.

605
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:56,599
At the office on East 43rd Street, I was trying
to make sense of the previous year's accounts

606
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,270
when the phone rang.

607
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:03,980
Who on earth wanted to speak to me at this
time on a Sunday?

608
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,440
I grabbed the phone.

609
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,210
It was Oldenberg.

610
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:13,140
"Marley, trust you to be in the office on
a Sunday.

611
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,770
Just wanted to bring you up to date on your
client."

612
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,780
I immediately felt tense.

613
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,390
"Go on," I said.

614
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:26,580
"I'm on my way back from Metropolitan Hospital,"
said Oldenberg.

615
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:34,310
"De La Cruz has been charged with murder."

616
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,670
CHAPTER FOUR
East Harlem

617
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:46,559
"Oldenberg," I began, "you've got a confused
guy in a hospital bed with serious head injuries,

618
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:49,599
and you add to the misery with a murder charge!"

619
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:55,130
"Just doing my job, Marley," he replied.

620
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,710
"Following procedure."

621
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,839
"Who's the murder victim?"

622
00:40:58,839 --> 00:40:59,839
I asked.

623
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:07,680
"A guy by the name of Alexei Romanov, some
businessman from Brighton Beach."

624
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,940
The same guy I'd read about in the Daily News.

625
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,859
"OK, Oldenberg.

626
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:20,119
You'd better explain how you reached the conclusion
that my client's a killer."

627
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:23,260
Oldenberg went on to give me the details.

628
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:30,000
The cause of death was a shot to the head
from the pistol which was found in the car.

629
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,640
Jose's fingerprints were on the handle and
trigger.

630
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:40,109
The results of the forensic tests proved that
he was the attacker.

631
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:43,510
Romanov's blood was found on Jose's jacket.

632
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:52,160
Also, the NYPD had positive identification
of a wallet found in his possession - it belonged

633
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,390
to Romanov.

634
00:41:54,390 --> 00:42:00,550
The police had the murder weapon, the killer,
and forensic evidence.

635
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:06,089
As far as Oldenberg was concerned, the investigation
was closed.

636
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:08,550
I had serious doubts.

637
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:13,809
All the evidence pointed toward Jose, but
what was the motive?

638
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:15,279
"OK, Oldenberg.

639
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:18,520
Have you established a motive?"

640
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,520
I asked.

641
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:27,790
"Maybe he saw the opportunity to get some
easy money - a carjacking, I guess," he answered.

642
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,859
Again, I wasn't convinced.

643
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:35,770
Could a sleepy drunk possibly be capable of
carjacking and murder?

644
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:39,750
"What do you mean, 'I guess'?

645
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,190
Where's the supporting evidence?

646
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,430
Do you have witnesses?"

647
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,430
I asked.

648
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:50,109
"Who needs witnesses with the amount of evidence
piled up against him?"

649
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,020
Oldenberg asked.

650
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,390
No point in continuing the conversation.

651
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:57,380
I'd learned enough.

652
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,779
The significant point was the lack of witnesses.

653
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:08,660
Oldenberg obviously thought that the forensic
evidence was enough to prove Jose was guilty.

654
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,720
Someone must have seen Jose and his buddies
celebrating that night.

655
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:19,040
I'd have to go to Brighton Beach to do some
of my own investigating.

656
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,160
Meanwhile, I needed to check on Jose.

657
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,490
A call to the hospital confirmed that his
condition was stable, but the doctors were

658
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:32,080
still keeping him under observation.

659
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,840
It seemed unlikely that he would be allowed
to leave the hospital.

660
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,349
But Jose was better off there than in a cell.

661
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:44,200
Another call, this time to Stella.

662
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,480
I brought her up to date on developments.

663
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:54,500
I also needed to get a clearer picture of
exactly what had happened on Wednesday night.

664
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,000
I had to speak to one of Jose's buddies.

665
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,440
Stella promised to set up a meeting with them
as soon as possible.

666
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,190
A few minutes later, Stella called back.

667
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,490
"Nat?

668
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:12,240
I've set up a meeting with Carlos and Miguel.

669
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,520
Can you get over here now?...

670
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,860
Yes?...

671
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,200
Good.

672
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:27,089
We'll be at my mom's apartment, 1295 First
Ave, apartment 104, on the tenth floor.

673
00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:34,390
That's the East River Housing, on First Avenue
between 102nd and 105th Streets.

674
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,250
We'll be expecting you.

675
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:42,150
Call me on my cell phone if you have any problem
finding it.

676
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,590
There wouldn't be any problem.

677
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:52,329
The area was Spanish Harlem, and I'd walked
most of those streets when I was an NYPD patrolman.

678
00:44:52,329 --> 00:45:01,140
My only hope was that his buddies would remember
something that had slipped Jose's mind, anything.

679
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:08,130
I took an uptown local train from Grand Central
to 103rd Street, then walked the three blocks

680
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:12,490
across town to the East River Housing project.

681
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:18,520
In the space of those seven subway stops,
the city changes completely.

682
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,140
In Spanish Harlem, there's not a skyscraper
in sight.

683
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:29,470
Only a few remaining traditional brownstone
houses among the anonymous gray concrete blocks

684
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:32,410
of the housing projects.

685
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:37,869
I was shown into a comfortably furnished room
overlooking the East River, with a view of

686
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:42,010
Wards Island at the southern tip of the Bronx.

687
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,980
Jose's buddies were there.

688
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,520
Two ordinary-looking guys in their early twenties.

689
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,609
Stella introduced us.

690
00:45:50,609 --> 00:45:51,809
"Nat.

691
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:55,310
I'd like you to meet Miguel and Carlos.

692
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:57,470
This is my boss, Nat.

693
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:03,280
He's like family to me, and we're doing everything
we can to help Jose.

694
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,789
I want you to tell everything to Nat just
like you told it to me."

695
00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:09,950
"All of it?

696
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:12,109
Again?" asked Carlos.

697
00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:14,589
"Yes, every bit.

698
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:19,470
You might recall something that could help
Jose," she said.

699
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,460
Carlos began.

700
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:27,900
Much of what they said confirmed what we already
knew from Jose's story: the interview at the

701
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:35,299
diner, the sightseeing tour of Coney Island,
the bars on Brighton Beach Avenue.

702
00:46:35,299 --> 00:46:41,539
What I was really interested in was the final
bar where Jose had fallen asleep.

703
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:48,700
"We ended up in this bar that had every kind
of vodka you could imagine," continued Carlos.

704
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:53,809
"The bartender in there got friendly when
we took an interest in the drinks.

705
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:55,710
He was recommending what to try."

706
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:58,630
"The name of the bar?"

707
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:59,630
I asked.

708
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,420
"Sorry, Nat.

709
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,300
I don't remember," replied Carlos.

710
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:13,160
"So, some bar, somewhere in Brighton Beach,
selling lots of different vodkas.

711
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,799
Could be one of many in New York's Little
Odessa.

712
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:21,170
Can you remember anything else about the bar?"

713
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,670
"The walls were covered with baseball stuff.

714
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:29,960
Team photos, shirts, bats... that sort of
thing.

715
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,100
I remember asking the bartender, 'Hey, what's
all this?

716
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,180
Baseball in the middle of the Russian community?'

717
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,819
Apparently the owner's a huge baseball fan."

718
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:43,520
"Good," I said.

719
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,099
"There can't be too many bars like that in
Little Odessa.

720
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,760
How long did you stay?"

721
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,950
"We tried all these different flavored vodkas.

722
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:58,560
After an hour or so, I knew I'd had too much.

723
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,349
My head was spinning.

724
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:06,190
Jose had fallen asleep, and I knew we'd have
to help him home.

725
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:12,069
We needed to get sober for the subway ride,
so Miguel and I went out to find some black

726
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:13,349
coffee.

727
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,619
We found a place that had coffee to go.

728
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:22,960
Carlos waited outside the bar with the coffees
while I went inside to get Jose.

729
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,260
But there was no sign of him.

730
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,260
I asked the bartender, but he didn't know.

731
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,940
We just thought he'd woken up and gone home."

732
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,240
"Thanks.

733
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,140
You've been a great help.

734
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:41,069
Call Stella if you remember anything more,"
I said.

735
00:48:41,069 --> 00:48:43,180
Progress at last.

736
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:47,309
I now had a starting point for my investigation.

737
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:52,549
I had to find the bar that Jose and his friends
had gone to.

738
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:57,059
Now I had a lead: the baseball connection.

739
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,210
Suddenly, my cell phone rang.

740
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,539
It was Captain Oldenberg.

741
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,230
"Marley?

742
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:06,579
It's your client De La Cruz.

743
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:08,119
The guy's gone crazy.

744
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:15,250
He broke out of an operating room and somehow
climbed up on the roof of the hospital.

745
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,619
He's threatening to throw himself off.

746
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:20,390
He might listen to you.

747
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:27,320
Can you come right now and help talk some
sense into him?"

748
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:33,980
CHAPTER FIVE
A matter of life or death

749
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:40,039
Metropolitan Hospital is only three blocks
downtown on First Avenue.

750
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:43,880
Stella ran on ahead and I hurried after her.

751
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,420
I was completely out of breath when I arrived.

752
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:54,030
Outside the main entrance was a collection
of various NYPD vehicles and a Fire Department

753
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:56,549
truck with a ladder.

754
00:49:56,549 --> 00:50:01,640
Barriers had been set up around the base of
the building with signs that read: 'Police

755
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,640
line.

756
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,260
Do not cross.'

757
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:10,119
High up on the top of the building, sitting
on the edge of the roof, I could make out

758
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:11,119
a figure.

759
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,000
It was Jose.

760
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,920
If he jumped, there was no way he'd survive.

761
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:25,559
Among the police vehicles was a large blue
van marked 'Tactical Response Unit.'

762
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:31,369
That's police language, which translated means
'a negotiation team.'

763
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:36,119
These are the people whose weapons are words,
not guns.

764
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:42,630
They will negotiate for hours or days to prevent
a crime or a tragedy.

765
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:45,720
I was relieved to see them here.

766
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,230
Those guys are so calm compared to officers
like Oldenberg.

767
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:53,970
They wouldn't get impatient watching paint
dry.

768
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:59,349
If it takes forty-eight hours to prevent a
potential death by talking to the guy, hour

769
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:02,670
after hour, they'll do it.

770
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:08,089
Persuasion, not force, is their philosophy.

771
00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:10,740
Oldenberg was waiting for us outside the entrance.

772
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:17,000
"Er, Marley," he began, "this is kind of embarrassing..."

773
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,280
I cut him off.

774
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,630
"Embarrassing?

775
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,550
It's a disaster!

776
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:27,960
How on earth did my client end up on the roof?"

777
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,960
I demanded.

778
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,900
"I thought you had him under twenty-four-hour
guard.

779
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,990
What's been going on here?

780
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:39,760
Is this another example of NYPD inefficiency?"

781
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,160
As we hurried through the hospital corridors,
Oldenberg raised his hands in apology.

782
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,390
"I can't offer any excuses.

783
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:51,790
Your client had been taken to an operating
room.

784
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:57,880
The police officer was told that De La Cruz
was unconscious, so he decided to take an

785
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,170
unofficial break outside.

786
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:07,470
The medical team had to leave De La Cruz temporarily
while they attended to a more urgent case.

787
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:13,890
During that time, he must have regained consciousness,
panicked and gone up to the roof."

788
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:18,200
An elevator took us up to the top floor.

789
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,109
We were taken through a door marked: 'No entry.'

790
00:52:22,109 --> 00:52:27,269
At the foot of the stairs to the roof, Dr.
Ericson was waiting.

791
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,720
She looked nervous and anxious.

792
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,319
"Mr. Marley and Ms. Delgado, thank God you're
here.

793
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,359
My patient needs people he knows and trusts.

794
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:41,230
You know he should be in the operating room?

795
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:47,560
He was being prepared for surgery before escaping
wearing only a surgical gown.

796
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,790
He's seriously ill.

797
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:55,970
I'm not trying to be dramatic, but this is
a matter of life or death."

798
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,849
"Thanks, Doctor.

799
00:52:57,849 --> 00:53:00,940
I understand your concern," I said.

800
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,869
"One more thing, Mr. Marley.

801
00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:08,619
There are some curious bruise marks on Mr.
De La Cruz's neck.

802
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:11,849
Like someone had gripped him violently.

803
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:16,339
He couldn't have received injuries like that
in a car crash."

804
00:53:16,339 --> 00:53:20,349
The doctor put her fingers and thumb around
her throat to demonstrate.

805
00:53:20,349 --> 00:53:25,990
"I told Captain Oldenberg, but he didn't seem
to take any notice.

806
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,670
I don't like that man's attitude."

807
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:30,380
"Me neither," I replied.

808
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,270
"Thanks for telling me.

809
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:35,549
It could be very important."

810
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:38,299
We climbed the stairs to the roof.

811
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:42,160
Outside, the wind was bitterly cold.

812
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,720
A woman was sitting on a low wall a few yards
away from Jose.

813
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,079
Detective Valdez from the negotiation team.

814
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:57,890
Jose was sitting on the wall, wrapped up in
a blanket from the operating room, with one

815
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:01,579
leg hanging over the edge.

816
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:06,119
Stella and I cautiously made our way along
the roof.

817
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:12,849
I don't like heights, especially when the
only protection from a fatal drop is a knee-high

818
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,309
wall.

819
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:16,640
We sat down beside her.

820
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,190
"Mr. Marley and Ms. Delgado?"

821
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,819
she said in a whisper, with her face turned
away from Jose.

822
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:26,069
"I'm very relieved to see you here.

823
00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:32,589
The more people there are around that Jose
knows and trusts, the more likely we are to

824
00:54:32,589 --> 00:54:35,000
talk him off the roof.

825
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,510
Just keep your distance from him until he's
ready to speak to you."

826
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,930
"Jose knows us as Nat and Stella.

827
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:46,839
Are there any other officers up here?"

828
00:54:46,839 --> 00:54:48,150
I asked.

829
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:49,390
"No.

830
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:55,580
I tried to get more in position, but Jose
noticed them and started to panic.

831
00:54:55,580 --> 00:55:03,009
So I insisted on just one officer, and here
I am," Valdez explained.

832
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:10,520
In situations like this, you never know whether
a suicide threat is a desperate call for help,

833
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,000
or if it's the real thing.

834
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
It's a situation where nobody can take chances.

835
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,150
The consequences could be disastrous.

836
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:27,700
Detective Valdez continued with the routine
that has saved countless lives in this city.

837
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,819
The technique was to establish a relationship
and gain trust.

838
00:55:32,819 --> 00:55:36,089
"Jose, you know who I am now.

839
00:55:36,089 --> 00:55:39,850
I just want to talk," she said.

840
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:41,859
No response from Jose.

841
00:55:41,859 --> 00:55:47,339
He put the blanket over his head, so his face
was hidden from view.

842
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:50,000
"I just want to know if you're listening.

843
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,789
Raise a hand if you're listening to me," she
asked.

844
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:59,130
Jose briefly raised his right hand.

845
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:02,960
She continued in the same smooth, calm voice.

846
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,230
"I've got some friends of yours here, Stella
and Nat.

847
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:10,240
They're worried about you.

848
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,630
Do you want to speak to them?"

849
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:16,160
Again, no response.

850
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,289
Detective Valdez didn't give up.

851
00:56:19,289 --> 00:56:22,279
"Jose, just listen.

852
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:24,160
You know these people.

853
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,630
They're trying to help you."

854
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:31,319
Valdez tried patiently again and again.

855
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:34,769
At last a reaction from Jose.

856
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:41,410
He pulled the blanket off, swung his leg back
from the edge, and stood up.

857
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:46,480
All he was wearing underneath was a green
surgical gown from the hospital operating

858
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,920
room.

859
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,589
The poor guy must have been freezing.

860
00:56:50,589 --> 00:56:54,500
"What can you do to help me?"

861
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,500
shouted Jose.

862
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,069
"I got a murder charge hanging over me.

863
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:01,960
What do I have to live for?...

864
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,660
My head...

865
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,970
I got this pain...

866
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:07,920
It won't go away."

867
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,539
"Speak to him, Nat," whispered Valdez.

868
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:17,040
I stood up, trying not to look down at the
drop below.

869
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,420
"Jose, we've got new evidence.

870
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:23,460
I can prove you didn't do it."

871
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:28,839
That wasn't strictly true, but it might encourage
him to come down from the roof.

872
00:57:28,839 --> 00:57:33,000
"Then how come they've charged me with murder?

873
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,549
How come?"

874
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:35,769
protested Jose.

875
00:57:35,769 --> 00:57:39,750
He threw the blanket over the edge.

876
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:45,589
There was a sudden shock of panic below until
it became obvious that it was the blanket

877
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:49,309
rather than Jose that was falling.

878
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:52,490
Then he sat on the wall, with his head down.

879
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:56,730
Again, he swung one leg over the edge.

880
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:58,599
"What do you think?"

881
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:00,319
I whispered to Valdez.

882
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:09,050
"Not good, but not a disaster, I'd like Stella
to talk to him now," she said.

883
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:13,460
Stella's voice was cracking with emotion as
she spoke.

884
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,910
"Jose?

885
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,250
Listen to me.

886
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:18,079
I know you didn't do it.

887
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,150
You're not a killer.

888
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:27,090
Something happened to you after you left that
bar and Nat's going to prove it.

889
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:31,630
We'll get you off this murder charge, I promise."

890
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:33,819
Silence.

891
00:58:33,819 --> 00:58:36,630
Stella appealed to him again.

892
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,740
Jose responded at last.

893
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:43,260
"What do you have to promise with?"

894
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,580
Now there was a change in his behavior.

895
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:53,119
Words were coming slowly as if speech involved
a major physical and mental effort.

896
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:58,980
"I... don't... know... I'm... finished...

897
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,319
My head..."

898
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:06,009
"What's happening?" asked Stella.

899
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:10,390
"I think he's going to jump," Valdez whispered.

900
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:14,490
"But I don't want to frighten him with any
sudden movements.

901
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:22,440
Nat, get ready to grab him, but don't move
until I say 'Now'."

902
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,950
Jose's body began to tremble violently.

903
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:29,560
He began to rock his body from side to side.

904
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,260
"I'm... a...

905
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:35,510
no... good... failure..." he muttered.

906
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:39,290
"Get ready, Nat," whispered Valdez.

907
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:43,380
"Start moving in on him."

908
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:48,559
Jose continued muttering to himself, with
his head lowered.

909
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:55,359
Sometimes what he said made sense, sometimes
it was just a confused string of words.

910
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:59,089
I crept along the roof towards him.

911
00:59:59,089 --> 01:00:01,690
"I'm... a...

912
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:05,599
no... good... fail..."

913
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:12,160
As Jose's voice trailed off into silence,
the sideways rocking motion continued.

914
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:19,440
With each swing, the top part of his body
hung for a moment over the vertical drop.

915
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,450
Then the return swing.

916
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:27,910
Behind me, Valdez shouted urgently: "This
is it.

917
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:28,910
NOW!"

918
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:32,279
Jose had reached the furthest point of the
swing.

919
01:00:32,279 --> 01:00:35,220
But this time he didn't return.

920
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:38,530
He was slipping off the edge.

921
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:43,890
I made a dive for his foot and just managed
to grab it.

922
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:48,550
Jose was now hanging upside down over the
edge.

923
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:55,010
I was also hanging over the edge, with only
my knees pressed against the wall preventing

924
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:58,500
me from following Jose.

925
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:04,880
Stella and Valdez were already hanging on
to me, but in that position, no one else could

926
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,220
reach Jose from the roof.

927
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:12,840
Jose was not light and I could feel my grip
slipping.

928
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:17,380
Valdez was screaming to the firefighters below:
"Move it!

929
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:22,460
Get that ladder up here before we have a fatality!"

930
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:29,119
I concentrated all my efforts on keeping my
arm locked around his foot.

931
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,730
Jose swung in space over the drop.

932
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:37,119
I could feel my muscles aching and weakening.

933
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:43,230
Then out of the corner of my eye, I noticed
the ladder swinging round.

934
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:49,309
At the top of the ladder, there was a firefighter,
who took Jose's unconscious body into his

935
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:54,359
powerful arms and swung him over his shoulder.

936
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:59,670
As Jose was brought down to safety, a medical
team on the ground was waiting to take him

937
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:02,200
straight to the operating room.

938
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:09,220
I pushed myself back from the edge and collapsed
behind the safety of the wall.

939
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:13,049
I opened my eyes to see Stella kneeling beside
me.

940
01:02:13,049 --> 01:02:17,019
"Nat, are you OK?" she asked.

941
01:02:17,019 --> 01:02:19,700
"You were wonderful!"

942
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:20,700
"Thanks.

943
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,380
I'm alright.

944
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,240
Just let me lie here.

945
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,060
I don't want to see that drop again just yet."

946
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:34,130
I lay there for a while, thinking it was good
to be alive, after all.

947
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:37,180
I'd had quite enough excitement for one day.

948
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:42,630
"Nat, you're a hero," said Valdez.

949
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:46,640
"Well, if I'm a hero, so are you.

950
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,450
You read all the signs that he was going to
jump.

951
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:56,190
Anyway, let's get down to the operating room
and see what's happening."

952
01:02:56,190 --> 01:03:01,670
We were informed that Dr. Ericson was already
operating on Jose.

953
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:06,960
The brain surgery was a delicate procedure
which would take hours.

954
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,619
There was also a high element of risk.

955
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:16,529
Jose had already put himself in danger by
escaping from the operating room.

956
01:03:16,529 --> 01:03:21,790
The added stress could only have done further
damage.

957
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:26,170
Stella decided to stay at the hospital and
wait for news.

958
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:29,869
As I left, she was calling her mother.

959
01:03:29,869 --> 01:03:40,910
A better option for me was home, food, beer,
TV, and relaxation.

960
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:46,119
CHAPTER SIX
The Odessa Steps

961
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:50,990
Monday morning, back at the office on East
43rd Street.

962
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:54,089
I was going to be all alone.

963
01:03:54,089 --> 01:03:57,220
Stella had stayed overnight at Metropolitan
Hospital.

964
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:02,930
Her brother had come out of surgery but was
still unconscious.

965
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:08,410
It was still too early to tell whether the
surgery had been a success.

966
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:14,160
I was now convinced that someone wanted a
convenient fall guy to take the blame for

967
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,750
Romanov's murder.

968
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:23,990
Maybe Jose had simply been unfortunate enough
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

969
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:29,180
Just a harmless guy enjoying an evening out
with his buddies.

970
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:32,910
Now he was facing a murder charge.

971
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,960
The problem was our total lack of evidence.

972
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,619
The whole thing made me angry.

973
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:43,970
But I couldn't allow that anger to affect
my judgment.

974
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:49,940
Meanwhile, I'd done a little research on the
cross that Edie Tilden had seen on the body

975
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,400
on Jones Beach.

976
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:58,760
It was definitely Russian - the design used
in the Russian Orthodox Church.

977
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,789
It was likely that the letters on the lifeboat
were also Russian.

978
01:05:03,789 --> 01:05:08,839
I now had photographs of Jose, Miguel, and
Carlos.

979
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:14,940
I'd phoned all the bars in the area and had
finally discovered one run by a baseball enthusiast

980
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:18,150
- the Odessa Steps.

981
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:23,480
I decided it was time to take a trip to Brighton
Beach and follow the movements of the three

982
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,440
friends on Wednesday night.

983
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,529
There was a small chance I'd pick up a few
pieces of evidence.

984
01:05:31,529 --> 01:05:35,799
As I was getting ready to leave, I had a surprise
phone call.

985
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:40,690
Edie Tilden, the elderly woman I'd met at
Jones Beach.

986
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:42,390
"Mr. Marley?

987
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:44,090
Edie Tilden.

988
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:45,790
Remember me?"

989
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:46,859
she asked.

990
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:51,200
"It's kind of hard to forget you," I replied.

991
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:58,319
"You're not going to believe this, but I found
two more bodies on the beach.

992
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:01,170
Cold and stiff, they were!"

993
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:03,119
I gripped the phone tightly.

994
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,200
"Now don't get over-excited.

995
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,690
Just describe what you saw.

996
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:09,690
Don't dramatize."

997
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:13,579
"Well, it was early this morning.

998
01:06:13,579 --> 01:06:19,099
I was out to see what the morning high tide
had washed up along the shore.

999
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:21,009
And then I found them.

1000
01:06:21,009 --> 01:06:23,809
Two more young men.

1001
01:06:23,809 --> 01:06:29,910
About five-hundred yards east from where the
boat was wrecked," said Edie.

1002
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:32,740
Edie went on to describe them.

1003
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:37,130
The two young men could have been anywhere
in their twenties.

1004
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:40,240
Like the other two bodies, they were very
thin.

1005
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:49,410
They were wearing cheap casual clothes: jeans,
denim jackets, T-shirts, and running shoes.

1006
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:54,990
Clothes worn by young men everywhere; nothing
specific to go on here.

1007
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:59,510
"Did you notice any jewelry or identifying
marks?

1008
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:01,059
Like scars?"

1009
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:02,430
I asked.

1010
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:06,039
"No, nothing like that," she said.

1011
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:08,089
"Thanks Edie.

1012
01:07:08,089 --> 01:07:09,400
That's good work.

1013
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,109
You should have been a detective.

1014
01:07:11,109 --> 01:07:14,309
Keep on with the beachcombing.

1015
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:18,900
Call me anytime you see something suspicious,
will you?"

1016
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,539
I was very curious.

1017
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:29,530
A murder in Coney Island, and now four bodies
washed up on Jones Beach.

1018
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:33,119
Romanov was a respected member of the Russian
community.

1019
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:39,279
And it looked like the four dead men found
on Jones Beach were also Russian.

1020
01:07:39,279 --> 01:07:41,970
Was there a connection?

1021
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:45,789
I was wondering how those boys had died.

1022
01:07:45,789 --> 01:07:49,789
Drowned accidentally in a storm or what?

1023
01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:55,059
I called the Coast Guard press officer, who
had prepared a news release.

1024
01:07:55,059 --> 01:07:58,660
He promised to email it to me immediately.

1025
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:02,859
As I put the phone down, the email came through.

1026
01:08:02,859 --> 01:08:06,400
U.S. Coast Guard Group Moriches

1027
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,400
Press Release

1028
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,859
Incident at Jones Beach, Long Island

1029
01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:17,940
The Coast Guard Service is currently investigating
the wreck of a lifeboat discovered on Jones

1030
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:23,130
Beach and also the discovery of four bodies
nearby.

1031
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:28,940
The victims are white, male, and aged between
twenty and thirty.

1032
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:34,480
The wreck is being investigated as suspicious
for the following reasons:

1033
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,759
No boats have been reported missing.

1034
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,690
No person has been reported missing at sea.

1035
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:45,560
The boat was not in seaworthy condition.

1036
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:49,970
No registration details are available for
the boat.

1037
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:54,850
If you have any information that would be
of assistance to the U.S. Coast Guard, please

1038
01:08:54,850 --> 01:09:03,549
contact Commander J. Lockhart, U.S. Coast
Guard Station Moriches, Long Island, New York.

1039
01:09:03,549 --> 01:09:09,670
I printed out the email and put it aside to
read again later.

1040
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:16,940
It was time to go Brighton Beach and pay a
visit to the bar where Jose had fallen asleep.

1041
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:22,089
I took an express Q train from the 42nd Street
subway station.

1042
01:09:22,089 --> 01:09:28,529
As the train made its way through the suburbs
of Brooklyn, I glanced through the Daily News.

1043
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:31,719
Nothing more on the Romanov story.

1044
01:09:31,719 --> 01:09:37,619
I got out at the Brighton Beach subway station
and started working my way along the avenue,

1045
01:09:37,619 --> 01:09:43,839
inquiring at bars whether Jose and his buddies
might have been drinking there.

1046
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:48,440
It was just before noon so the bars were still
quiet.

1047
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:53,819
A couple of bartenders vaguely recognized
the photographs but couldn't provide me with

1048
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:56,530
anything useful.

1049
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:59,639
I finally arrived at the Odessa Steps.

1050
01:09:59,639 --> 01:10:06,969
Inside, the walls were covered with baseball
souvenirs: picture after picture of the famous

1051
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:14,510
Brooklyn Dodgers teams who dominated the American
baseball scene in the 1940s and 50s.

1052
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:19,070
I ordered a beer and sat down to take in the
atmosphere.

1053
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:27,030
The lunchtime crowd was arriving and the bar
was becoming noisy with Russian conversation.

1054
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:32,860
At the next table, one of the staff had a
collection of tools on the table and also,

1055
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:36,400
a beautiful antique baseball bat.

1056
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,050
He was preparing to put it on the wall.

1057
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:41,770
"Excuse me," I said.

1058
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,820
"I'm interested in the bat.

1059
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:46,830
I bet it has a history.

1060
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:49,869
Something new for the baseball exhibition,
huh?"

1061
01:10:49,869 --> 01:10:58,969
"This bat, mister, was used in the final game
of the 1955 World Series," proudly replied

1062
01:10:58,969 --> 01:11:05,090
the bartender, "when the Brooklyn Dodgers
beat the New York Yankees.

1063
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:07,520
It's my boss's favorite piece.

1064
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,130
He paid a fortune for it."

1065
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:14,500
"At today's prices, I'm sure he did," I said.

1066
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:20,220
"Well, that was back in the 1980s, so it isn't
a new piece.

1067
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:23,530
We've had it up here in the bar for years.

1068
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:30,980
You're not going to believe this, but Wednesday
night last week, some joker pulled it off

1069
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:31,980
the wall."

1070
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,639
"No kidding!

1071
01:11:34,639 --> 01:11:39,680
Whoever it was would've been lucky to get
out of here alive," I commented.

1072
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:43,350
"I guess so," he said.

1073
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:49,489
I showed him my investigator's license, and
also the photos of Jose and his buddies.

1074
01:11:49,489 --> 01:11:54,219
"Did you happen to see these three guys in
here on Wednesday?"

1075
01:11:54,219 --> 01:11:56,120
I asked.

1076
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:59,380
He immediately pointed at Jose's picture.

1077
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,090
"Hey, that's the guy who grabbed the bat!"

1078
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:05,110
"What time was this?"

1079
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:07,719
"Had to be nine o'clock.

1080
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:13,620
I remember because it was just before my break,"
the bartender replied.

1081
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:19,150
"What happened to this guy after he tried
to take the bat?"

1082
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:22,730
So far the bartender had been talkative.

1083
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:26,400
Now he looked nervous and started to hesitate.

1084
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,400
"Er...

1085
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,440
I must have been on my break.

1086
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:35,800
Look, why don't you ask my colleague behind
the bar.

1087
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,800
He'll remember."

1088
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:42,800
The conversation with the other bartender
followed the same pattern.

1089
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:48,360
His memory was perfectly clear up to the point
when Jose took the bat.

1090
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:54,020
Mysteriously, they both suffered from total
memory loss after that.

1091
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:56,960
Were they hiding something?

1092
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,900
Or were they scared of something?

1093
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,950
I was certain about one thing.

1094
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:09,150
If a stranger walked into this bar and attempted
to steal one of their sports treasures, they'd

1095
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:12,639
be lucky to get away unharmed.

1096
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:18,650
Was it possible Jose received those throat
and head injuries in the bar?

1097
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:25,219
I didn't think I was going to find out anything
more, but at least I had made some progress.

1098
01:13:25,219 --> 01:13:29,590
Jose and his buddies had definitely been in
the bar.

1099
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:37,420
I had a time, 9:00 PM, when Jose must have
woken up, and in his confused state made a

1100
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:39,969
grab for the bat.

1101
01:13:39,969 --> 01:13:44,650
But why wouldn't the bartenders reveal anything
more?

1102
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:49,560
I stayed at the bar and ordered a roast beef
sandwich and fries.

1103
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:56,650
While I was waiting for the food, I made a
call to Stella at Metropolitan hospital.

1104
01:13:56,650 --> 01:14:04,070
Jose was still in intensive care, slipping
into a coma, a state of deep unconsciousness.

1105
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:06,820
"Nat," said Stella.

1106
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:10,920
"My mom's going to take over for me at the
hospital.

1107
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:14,100
I'll be going home soon to get some sleep.

1108
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,239
I'm just exhausted.

1109
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:18,780
But I'll be at the office first thing tomorrow."

1110
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:25,010
"You know you don't have to if you want to
keep your mom company," I said.

1111
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:31,260
"Nat, I'm depending on you to clear Jose's
name and prove his innocence.

1112
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,920
Let's get on with this investigation.

1113
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,639
I'm going to be right there with you."

1114
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:44,239
CHAPTER SEVEN
Evidence

1115
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:50,590
Early Tuesday morning, on Main Street in Queens,
the weather was just awful.

1116
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:56,570
It was pouring, with fat raindrops bouncing
off the sidewalks.

1117
01:14:56,570 --> 01:15:04,080
Car headlights were reflecting off the road
surface, in places now inches deep in water.

1118
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,760
I splashed along the sidewalk.

1119
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:13,240
My hat and coat were soaking wet by the time
I got to the subway station.

1120
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:18,350
At East 43rd Street, it all seemed like a
normal day.

1121
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:23,210
Stella was already at her desk going through
the morning mail.

1122
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:27,300
She gave me her usual bright 'Hi, Nat.'

1123
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:33,360
But underneath that cheerful exterior, I knew
she was deeply worried.

1124
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:40,179
As soon as I'd woken up, I'd phoned the hospital
to get an update on Jose's condition.

1125
01:15:40,179 --> 01:15:43,780
I was simply told: 'No change'.

1126
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:50,670
The investigation into Jose's evening at Brighton
Beach had made little progress.

1127
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:54,739
I'd also had a call from Lena Rosenthal.

1128
01:15:54,739 --> 01:16:00,440
Oldenberg had given all the relevant police
information to Lena, our lawyer.

1129
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:04,690
This included the autopsy report on Romanov.

1130
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:09,910
We had arranged a midmorning meeting at East
43rd Street.

1131
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:12,250
Over breakfast, I did some thinking.

1132
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:19,950
I recalled the basic points of police procedure
which I'd been taught years ago at the NYPD

1133
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,440
Academy.

1134
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:31,100
In every investigation, always establish M.O.M.,
which stands for 'Motive, Opportunity, and

1135
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,100
Means.'

1136
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:38,090
Motive - why did the suspect commit the crime?

1137
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:43,940
Opportunity - did the suspect have the chance
to carry out the crime?

1138
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:49,650
Means - did the suspect have the weapon to
carry out the crime?

1139
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:55,690
But when you applied this system to Jose nothing
seemed to make sense.

1140
01:16:55,690 --> 01:17:00,820
There's nothing out of the ordinary in a guy
having too many drinks and waking up in a

1141
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:03,139
strange bar.

1142
01:17:03,139 --> 01:17:09,590
But how and why could he suddenly come into
the possession of a handgun, steal a car,

1143
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:12,650
and commit murder?

1144
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:18,020
Later that morning, Lena was going through
some of the details of Romanov's autopsy report

1145
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:19,270
with me.

1146
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:23,639
"What worries me Nat, is timing," she began.

1147
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:31,719
"We know that Jose probably left the Odessa
Steps at or around nine o'clock.

1148
01:17:31,719 --> 01:17:39,420
According to this report, Romanov's time of
death was somewhere between 8:45 and 9:45

1149
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:41,150
the same evening.

1150
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:48,010
Now, for a drunk who'd just woken up, Jose
would have to have been one fast mover."

1151
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:50,270
"Agreed," I said.

1152
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:57,890
"There's absolutely nothing to show how or
where he came across Romanov," Lena continued.

1153
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:05,639
"Did he just walk out into the street, wave
a car to stop, and then rob and brutally murder

1154
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,650
the driver?

1155
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:11,030
As I see it, there's no logic here.

1156
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:13,840
No supporting evidence apart from the forensics."

1157
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,920
"Anything more in the reports?"

1158
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:23,080
"Cause of death, a gunshot to the head at
close range.

1159
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,920
Romanov was on the ground when he was killed.

1160
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:32,840
According to the report, there was bruising
on his upper arms which could indicate the

1161
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:37,290
killer was standing on his arms when the fatal
shot was fired."

1162
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:42,929
Stella, who had been making some notes, suddenly
interrupted.

1163
01:18:42,929 --> 01:18:47,659
"Ms. Rosenthal, I need to get something clear.

1164
01:18:47,659 --> 01:18:51,670
The fingerprints that were found on the gun
barrel.

1165
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:53,719
Right-hand or left-hand prints?"

1166
01:18:53,719 --> 01:19:00,060
"All right-hand prints, according to the report,"
Lena replied.

1167
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:04,260
Stella said nothing but just looked down at
the notepad.

1168
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,590
"Stella, is Jose right-handed?"

1169
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:09,469
I asked.

1170
01:19:09,469 --> 01:19:11,469
Stella nodded.

1171
01:19:11,469 --> 01:19:13,340
Another setback.

1172
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:16,860
If only Jose was lefthanded.

1173
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:21,970
Another possible line of investigation closed.

1174
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:27,520
Oldenberg had not followed official procedure
after Dr. Ericson had reported the bruises

1175
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,130
on Jose's neck.

1176
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:34,530
With some minor blackmail, I could ask a favor.

1177
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:38,050
I thought I might have a talk with Oldenberg.

1178
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:43,570
I knew a subject that would hold his attention:
baseball.

1179
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:48,130
His mind is an encyclopedia of baseball history.

1180
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:49,370
"Oldenberg?

1181
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:51,850
It's Marley.

1182
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:57,380
Just called to tell you I've been admiring
a bat used by the Brooklyn Dodgers in the

1183
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:02,670
final game of the 1955 World Series."

1184
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:06,550
There was a low whistle of surprise from Oldenberg.

1185
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:09,320
I knew I had his full attention.

1186
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:16,150
"It's a valuable piece of baseball history,"
I continued, "and you can see it for yourself

1187
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:20,489
at the Odessa Steps bar on Brighton Beach.

1188
01:20:20,489 --> 01:20:25,040
They've got a whole museum of baseball stuff
around the walls.

1189
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:31,480
But last Wednesday night, some guy pulled
this bat off the wall."

1190
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,580
"Hey, that would be terrible.

1191
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:36,290
That guy would be lucky to..."

1192
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:38,890
"Get out of the place in one piece?"

1193
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:40,280
I suggested.

1194
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:43,920
"That's what people at the bar told me.

1195
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:49,280
And the guy is the accused, Jose De La Cruz.

1196
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,030
But he got out of the bar somehow.

1197
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:55,060
And then look what happened to him.

1198
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:57,550
Kind of strange, don't you think?

1199
01:20:57,550 --> 01:21:04,180
Especially when the bar staff went suspiciously
quiet when I asked what happened after Jose

1200
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:05,980
grabbed the bat."

1201
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:09,090
"I don't know what to say, Marley.

1202
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:12,489
This information might have an effect on the
case."

1203
01:21:12,489 --> 01:21:14,620
"Think about it.

1204
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:21,710
Now," I continued, "it's come to my attention
that medical staff at Metropolitan reported

1205
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:28,210
bruising on De La Cruz's neck, which couldn't
have been the result of the car crash.

1206
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:32,300
But you didn't order a medical examination
of my client."

1207
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:35,030
"How did you know about that?"

1208
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:36,719
demanded Oldenberg.

1209
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:40,290
"Just doing my job," I replied calmly.

1210
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:43,110
"I have my contacts.

1211
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:50,550
I'm prepared to ignore this failure to follow
official procedure if you do me a little favor.

1212
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:57,400
I need an official introduction from the NYPD
to Lockhart, Commander of the Coast Guard

1213
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,750
Group in Moriches.

1214
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:01,630
That's the Long Island South section."

1215
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:05,469
"What's this all about, Marley?"

1216
01:22:05,469 --> 01:22:09,060
"Let's just say another line of inquiry."

1217
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:12,490
One o'clock.

1218
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:18,650
It had been a busy morning and I could hear
a cold beer calling my name from McFadden's

1219
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:19,969
Bar.

1220
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:27,090
McFadden's Bar is just a block across town
from the office, on Second Avenue, a favorite

1221
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:30,590
watering hole for New York journalists.

1222
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:35,469
I phoned the bar to check whether Ed Winchester
was there.

1223
01:22:35,469 --> 01:22:39,719
Ed's an old friend and a wonderful source
of information.

1224
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:46,480
He'd been chief crime reporter for the Daily
News for years, and still did some part-time

1225
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:52,190
work for the paper, though he was now officially
retired.

1226
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:57,380
No sooner had I entered the bar than I heard
my name being called.

1227
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:04,280
A tall elderly guy with silver hair and a
deeply-lined face was waving an empty glass

1228
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,489
at me.

1229
01:23:05,489 --> 01:23:08,070
"Nat, perfect timing!"

1230
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:09,790
Ed said.

1231
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:15,130
"That must mean your glass needs refilling,"
I replied.

1232
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:21,889
I took the beers over to an empty table and
went though all the recent events with Ed:

1233
01:23:21,889 --> 01:23:28,740
Romanov's death, Jose's night out at Brighton
Beach, the wrecked lifeboat, and the bodies

1234
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,250
on Jones Beach.

1235
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:36,320
"You see, Ed, there seem to be Russian connections
everywhere.

1236
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:43,100
I was just curious whether you'd heard anything
about crime among the Russian community."

1237
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:47,020
"Money laundering is the big one," he replied.

1238
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:54,130
"In international terms, the Russian ruble
is seen as little more than toy money.

1239
01:23:54,130 --> 01:24:00,810
So much of the real business of crime is done
in hard currency, in U.S. dollars.

1240
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:07,040
A lot of illegal dollars from that black economy
are probably coming in to the U.S.A. from

1241
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,450
Russia.

1242
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:14,370
The problem then is how to integrate that
money into the legal economy here without

1243
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:17,110
attracting attention."

1244
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:19,920
I'd heard about money laundering.

1245
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:25,880
Anybody running organized crime operations
like drugs or illegal gambling receives huge

1246
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,530
amounts of cash.

1247
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:34,420
Thus the need for your friendly neighborhood
money launderer to clean the dirty money by

1248
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:39,949
transferring it through a network of bank
accounts until nobody can find where it came

1249
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:41,790
from.

1250
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:48,820
Once it reappears at the other end of the
process, the money's clean and legal.

1251
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:54,650
Ed called the crime desk to see if they knew
of any money laundering activity in the Russian

1252
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:55,650
community.

1253
01:24:55,650 --> 01:25:01,900
He listened carefully for a couple of minutes,
then turned to me with a broad smile.

1254
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:06,820
"There's a guy by the name of Victor Kamenev"
he said.

1255
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:14,530
"It seems he was depositing regular amounts
of cash, up to ten thousand dollars at a time,

1256
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:17,860
in a variety of banks around lower Manhattan.

1257
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:22,219
He's got a business - Kamenev Finance.

1258
01:25:22,219 --> 01:25:28,030
Of course, there was the usual gossip at the
crime desk as to whether he was laundering

1259
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:33,710
money for the Russian Mafia but no concrete
evidence."

1260
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:39,540
Ed had delivered the goods again, and cheap
at the price of a beer.

1261
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:46,650
Another Russian name - but was there any possible
connection between Romanov's death and the

1262
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:49,300
wreck on Jones Beach?

1263
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:55,530
I walked across town to First Avenue and wandered
through the United Nations Plaza over to the

1264
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:57,599
East River.

1265
01:25:57,599 --> 01:26:02,900
Walking time is thinking time so I just ignored
the rain.

1266
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:07,650
I needed a way to gain access to the Russian
community.

1267
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:11,219
Alexei Romanov's widow could be our entry
key.

1268
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:19,179
But under the circumstances, we might have
to be a little economical with the truth.

1269
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:25,360
The initial approach to Mrs. Romanov would
need tact and sensitivity - more Stella's

1270
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:28,330
specialty than mine.

1271
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:34,960
Back at the office, after describing the plan
to Stella, she made that all-important call.

1272
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:40,060
Her telephone manner was, as always, perfect.

1273
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:42,420
"Mrs. Romanov?

1274
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:47,340
I'm very sorry to disturb you at this extremely
sad time.

1275
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,780
I'm Stella Delgado.

1276
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:56,940
My employer, Mr. Nat Marley, is investigating
a matter which is of deep concern to the Russian

1277
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:58,850
community..."

1278
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:08,210
After Stella had completed the call, we had
an appointment for the following afternoon.

1279
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:13,110
CHAPTER EIGHT
Mrs. Romanov

1280
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:18,570
It was one of those March mornings when the
weather still hadn't made up its mind if it's

1281
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:23,040
the depth of winter or the beginning of spring.

1282
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,540
An icy wind was cutting across Manhattan.

1283
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:31,550
A few snowflakes were falling from the heavy,
gray clouds.

1284
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:36,900
I'd arranged to meet Stella at Metropolitan
Hospital, where she'd been at Jose's bedside

1285
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:39,119
with her mom.

1286
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:44,040
Stella was waiting outside the main entrance,
shivering with cold.

1287
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:48,520
"You'll catch your death of cold out here,
Stella," I said.

1288
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:51,239
"I prefer it out here.

1289
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:54,760
Right now I've had enough of hospitals.

1290
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,869
I've just been with Jose for an hour.

1291
01:27:57,869 --> 01:28:00,000
There's no change.

1292
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,739
Still in a deep coma.

1293
01:28:01,739 --> 01:28:05,090
Just the same as before.

1294
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:10,679
At least the police are being more relaxed
about access now that he's unconscious."

1295
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:16,180
"I'd like to see him anyway now that I'm here,"
I said.

1296
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:19,730
We made our way up to Jose's room.

1297
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:24,790
As usual, the police guard was on duty outside
the room.

1298
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:30,160
Through the window, I could see Stella's mom
at the bedside, talking to the unconscious

1299
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:31,160
Jose.

1300
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,760
"See that, Nat?

1301
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,830
Mom spends hour after hour chatting to him.

1302
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:40,840
She's convinced she's getting through to him.

1303
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:44,000
But I haven't noticed any kind of response."

1304
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,389
"Let's hope it does some good," I said.

1305
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:52,320
I didn't feel it was appropriate to enter
the room.

1306
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,590
Jose was with his family.

1307
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:59,940
I knew that the unconscious brain can still
be active and functioning.

1308
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:06,620
I just hoped he was receiving something, something
that might get though whatever block was keeping

1309
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:09,940
him from regaining consciousness.

1310
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:16,500
Yesterday, Oldenberg had emailed me a letter
of introduction to a Commander Lockhart of

1311
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:22,349
the U.S. Coast Guard, who was based at the
Moriches Coast Guard Station.

1312
01:29:22,349 --> 01:29:28,060
I'd already made an appointment to talk to
him about the Jones Beach wreck.

1313
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:33,720
The wrecked lifeboat was now being stored
at Jones Beach Coast Guard Station, and I

1314
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:37,250
had arranged to meet Lockhart there.

1315
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:43,540
I was curious to examine it and prove any
new Russian connections.

1316
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:48,760
As far as this investigation was concerned,
it was all a very long shot.

1317
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:52,650
It could easily be a pointless visit.

1318
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:57,429
But I felt we should be doing something for
Jose.

1319
01:29:57,429 --> 01:30:02,260
The subway was clear of the worst of the rush
hour crowds.

1320
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:08,739
As the number four train sped downtown toward
midtown Manhattan, I thought over what I knew

1321
01:30:08,739 --> 01:30:12,790
about Jose's night out in Brighton Beach.

1322
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:19,540
If only he would regain consciousness, then
he might recall something relevant.

1323
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:26,139
From 51st Street, an E train took us west
across town to Penn Station, where we took

1324
01:30:26,139 --> 01:30:29,739
a Long Island Rail Road train to Freeport.

1325
01:30:29,739 --> 01:30:35,880
A forty-minute journey, but quicker and cheaper
than any cab.

1326
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:43,110
As the train made its way through the suburbs
of Queens, I noticed Stella biting her lip.

1327
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:49,020
I know that little habit of hers; it means
something is on her mind.

1328
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,260
"Are you OK, Stella?"

1329
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:52,260
I asked.

1330
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:56,710
"This past week, Nat, has been a total nightmare.

1331
01:30:56,710 --> 01:31:01,010
I'm tense and anxious all the time.

1332
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:04,360
We seem to be getting nowhere fast.

1333
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:10,969
I know it's not your fault, you're doing everything
you possibly can, but there are times when

1334
01:31:10,969 --> 01:31:14,510
I feel like tearing my hair out and screaming."

1335
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:18,110
"Don't give up hope, Stella," I said.

1336
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:22,480
"I won't let Jose down, believe me.

1337
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:25,909
I'm positive the evidence is out there.

1338
01:31:25,909 --> 01:31:28,929
The pressure's getting me down too.

1339
01:31:28,929 --> 01:31:35,040
If this was an ordinary, everyday investigation,
I'd be able to walk away from it and put it

1340
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,030
right out of my mind.

1341
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:40,730
But it's there with me all the time.

1342
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:45,190
If I wake up in the middle of the night, I'm
thinking about it.

1343
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:49,239
We'll crack this case somehow."

1344
01:31:49,239 --> 01:31:55,070
We took a cab from Freeport to the Jones Beach
Coast Guard Station, where we were welcomed

1345
01:31:55,070 --> 01:32:02,110
by the officer responsible for Long Island
South, Commander Lockhart, a tall, fit-looking

1346
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:04,180
man in his fifties.

1347
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:10,850
"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Marley," said Lockhart,
shaking my hand with a firm grip.

1348
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:15,260
"Captain Oldenberg asked me to give you every
possible assistance."

1349
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:18,070
"Thanks," I said.

1350
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:22,190
"This is my assistant, Stella Delgado.

1351
01:32:22,190 --> 01:32:27,720
We're working on a case that just might have
a connection with the recent incident on Jones

1352
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:29,219
Beach.

1353
01:32:29,219 --> 01:32:36,270
As you know, we'd like to see that wrecked
lifeboat which was recovered," I replied.

1354
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:41,599
Lockhart took us out to a workshop alongside
the Coast Guard building.

1355
01:32:41,599 --> 01:32:46,679
Inside was part of what had once been a well-built
boat.

1356
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:49,619
The paint was peeling off it.

1357
01:32:49,619 --> 01:32:54,460
Some clean fresh wood was visible where the
boat had split in two.

1358
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:58,320
At the back of the boat were the faded letters.

1359
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:03,030
They did look like Russian letters.

1360
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:08,139
Lockhart took a screwdriver from a workbench
and pointed at a section of the boat.

1361
01:33:08,139 --> 01:33:16,239
"I'd like to demonstrate to you just how poor
the condition of this boat is," he announced.

1362
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:19,889
He drove the blade of the screwdriver into
the wood.

1363
01:33:19,889 --> 01:33:23,010
It went through with little effort.

1364
01:33:23,010 --> 01:33:27,150
The wood was completely rotten.

1365
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:28,389
Stella gasped.

1366
01:33:28,389 --> 01:33:30,719
"Those poor guys!"

1367
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:31,719
she exclaimed.

1368
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:34,710
"They wouldn't have had a chance."

1369
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:40,210
"This boat was no more than a floating grave,"
Lockhart continued.

1370
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:42,720
"It's completely falling apart."

1371
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:47,520
"What about the four guys who were found on
Jones Beach?"

1372
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,780
I asked.

1373
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:52,540
"I have the full autopsy details in my office.

1374
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:57,840
Shall we go there and I'll show you?" he suggested.

1375
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:02,010
Inside his office, Lockhart sorted through
a pile of documents.

1376
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:04,820
"Here we are.

1377
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:07,940
Cause of death: exposure and drowning.

1378
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:12,210
They must have floated for as long as they
could.

1379
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:15,070
Maybe holding on to what was left of the boat.

1380
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:21,889
But the chance of survival in those temperatures
would have been very slight," he said.

1381
01:34:21,889 --> 01:34:26,920
"Was there any form of identification on the
bodies?" asked Stella.

1382
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:33,660
"All that was found were some Russian labels
on their clothes, and a Russian Orthodox cross.

1383
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:37,470
But otherwise, we've no identification.

1384
01:34:37,470 --> 01:34:43,099
We're running a check with the Russian authorities,
but these things take time."

1385
01:34:43,099 --> 01:34:48,940
"Off the record, what do you think really
happened to these guys?"

1386
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:50,320
I asked.

1387
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:56,090
"Our guess is an illegal immigration operation,"
Lockhart began.

1388
01:34:56,090 --> 01:35:02,599
"They probably paid a huge amount of money
for the privilege of being smuggled from Russia

1389
01:35:02,599 --> 01:35:04,320
into the U.S.A.

1390
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:12,790
In cases like these, another bigger boat would
be involved, probably a small fishing boat.

1391
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:17,670
They remain offshore, then transfer the immigrants
into smaller boats."

1392
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:23,730
"Are you talking about occasional incidents
or regular shipments of immigrants?"

1393
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:24,980
I asked.

1394
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:28,850
"We suspect regular traffic.

1395
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:35,429
We've had a number of reports of suspicious
activity from routine Coast Guard patrols.

1396
01:35:35,429 --> 01:35:41,110
The Coast Guard has carried out a number of
search and seizure operations at sea, but

1397
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:44,099
our resources are limited.

1398
01:35:44,099 --> 01:35:50,180
For every illegal immigrant we seize, there
could be others slipping through the net.

1399
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:56,750
Of course, we question the ones we catch,
but never learn anything really useful, like

1400
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:59,670
names of the people behind the operation."

1401
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:02,590
"Thanks," I said.

1402
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,750
"This has been very useful.

1403
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:09,750
If I discover anything relevant, I'll let
you know."

1404
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:17,420
"Mr. Marley, whoever put any people into that
boat might as well have been holding a gun

1405
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:20,010
to their heads," said Lockhart.

1406
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:24,159
"You realize there could still be more bodies?

1407
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:28,800
It could take time before they're all washed
onto the beach."

1408
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:33,900
From Jones Beach, we took a cab to Brighton
Beach.

1409
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:39,680
The heavy clouds had begun to lift slightly
and the occasional ray of sunshine was breaking

1410
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,199
through.

1411
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:48,840
Our next appointment - with Alexei Romanov's
widow - had to be handled very delicately.

1412
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:55,580
The Romanov house was situated in a wealthy
neighborhood of Brighton Beach, off Shore

1413
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:56,580
Boulevard.

1414
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:59,610
Large houses with well-cared for gardens.

1415
01:36:59,610 --> 01:37:06,200
None of the trees had been optimistic enough
to think about bursting into leaf yet.

1416
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:10,650
The temperature couldn't have been much above
freezing.

1417
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:16,260
The door was answered by a maid who took our
names and left us waiting in the entrance

1418
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:17,429
hall.

1419
01:37:17,429 --> 01:37:24,840
Soon, she returned and led us into an elegantly
furnished dining room.

1420
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:32,159
Mrs. Romanov then entered - a tall gray-haired
woman wearing a black dress with a simple

1421
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:36,219
gold pin fastened at her throat.

1422
01:37:36,219 --> 01:37:41,530
In her face, you could see the grief that
she must have been going through.

1423
01:37:41,530 --> 01:37:44,579
"Ms. Delgado and Mr. Marley.

1424
01:37:44,579 --> 01:37:45,579
Welcome.

1425
01:37:45,579 --> 01:37:48,040
Do sit down," she said.

1426
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:54,079
"We realize that this is not an appropriate
time to visit," began Stella.

1427
01:37:54,079 --> 01:38:00,199
"We're aware of the good work your late husband
did with newly arrived Russian immigrants,

1428
01:38:00,199 --> 01:38:03,130
and we'd like to offer our deepest sympathies."

1429
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:05,579
"Thank you.

1430
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:08,139
You're most kind," she said.

1431
01:38:08,139 --> 01:38:14,260
"Our visit concerns Russian immigrants who
may have been attempting to enter the country

1432
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:16,250
illegally.

1433
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:22,139
You may have heard about the bodies found
on Jones Beach?" asked Stella.

1434
01:38:22,139 --> 01:38:23,800
Mrs. Romanov nodded.

1435
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:28,760
"They were probably young Russian men," Stella
continued.

1436
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:35,370
"The boat they were sailing in was in a completely
unseaworthy condition.

1437
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:40,790
Whoever was behind this immigrant smuggling
operation had surely sent these boys to their

1438
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:43,030
deaths."

1439
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:45,260
Mrs. Romanov frowned.

1440
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:47,730
I could see we had her attention.

1441
01:38:47,730 --> 01:38:50,540
"But this is dreadful!

1442
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:54,810
Can I be of any assistance?" asked Mrs. Romanov.

1443
01:38:54,810 --> 01:39:01,520
"Poor Alexei would have moved heaven and earth
to bring the people responsible to justice."

1444
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:06,750
I judged it was the right time to make my
move.

1445
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:12,929
"I realize that this is not a suitable time
to ask this question, ma'am," I said.

1446
01:39:12,929 --> 01:39:17,949
"We know your husband was active with the
Immigrant Welfare Society.

1447
01:39:17,949 --> 01:39:22,530
Could he possibly have made any enemies in
the Russian community?

1448
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:29,139
You see, there could be some connection between
your husband's death and these poor boys found

1449
01:39:29,139 --> 01:39:31,920
on Jones beach."

1450
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:38,070
I really couldn't be absolutely sure of my
facts here, but again, there was no harm in

1451
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:43,420
taking a chance if we were going to make any
progress with Jose's case.

1452
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:49,710
"The police have already asked me all about..."
began Mrs. Romanov.

1453
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:53,730
She then paused and gave me a hard stare.

1454
01:39:53,730 --> 01:39:59,980
"I don't think you're being completely truthful
with me, Mr. Marley.

1455
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:03,929
What is the real reason for your visit?"

1456
01:40:03,929 --> 01:40:07,270
It was time to put all our cards on the table.

1457
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:11,210
"Mrs. Romanov, I apologize.

1458
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:15,280
Yes, I have been less than honest.

1459
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:22,869
I am a private investigator representing my
client, Jose De La Cruz, who, as you know,

1460
01:40:22,869 --> 01:40:27,320
has been charged with the murder of your late
husband.

1461
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:32,670
I do not believe that your husband was the
victim of a simple street crime.

1462
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:40,020
I suspect your husband had discovered something
that put his life in danger."

1463
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:42,880
Mrs. Romanov's face grew pale.

1464
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,420
She sat silently and still as I continued.

1465
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:51,680
"We also have to admit that our interest in
this case is personal.

1466
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:59,050
Our client, Jose De La Cruz is Ms. Delgado's
younger brother."

1467
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:01,829
Stella turned to face Mrs. Romanov.

1468
01:41:01,829 --> 01:41:07,570
"Believe me, Mrs. Romanov, this is difficult
for me too.

1469
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:12,340
As God is my witness, my brother is not a
killer.

1470
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:18,619
Just a gentle, harmless, ordinary guy who
must've been in the wrong place at the wrong

1471
01:41:18,619 --> 01:41:21,200
time," said Stella.

1472
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:30,250
I continued, "As far as the NYPD are concerned,
they've found their killer, but I'm not convinced.

1473
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:37,409
I am asking for your help in finding your
husband's real killer or killers.

1474
01:41:37,409 --> 01:41:43,440
I can't be more honest than that."

1475
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:48,889
CHAPTER NINE
Victor Kamenev

1476
01:41:48,889 --> 01:41:54,560
Mrs. Romanov stood up and stared out the window
for a moment before speaking again.

1477
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,179
"Mr. Marley, Ms. Delgado," she said.

1478
01:41:58,179 --> 01:42:01,590
"I believe you are sincere.

1479
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:06,139
You may count on my cooperation and support."

1480
01:42:06,139 --> 01:42:09,050
Stella looked at me and smiled.

1481
01:42:09,050 --> 01:42:15,880
Mrs. Romanov continued: "You appreciate this
is a very difficult time for me.

1482
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,510
But I'll do my best.

1483
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:22,159
There's something quite weird about the events
of last week.

1484
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:27,409
I've had this feeling that the police have
not made every effort to investigate the case

1485
01:42:27,409 --> 01:42:29,530
fully.

1486
01:42:29,530 --> 01:42:32,800
Alexei was well respected for all his community
work.

1487
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,449
He had a fine reputation.

1488
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:38,719
He made friends rather than enemies.

1489
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:45,770
I think of all the people he's helped to settle
here and become good American citizens, and

1490
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:49,969
I'm not aware of anyone who could have anything
against him."

1491
01:42:49,969 --> 01:42:53,560
"Did he ever mention any names?

1492
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:55,750
Any little remarks he made about people?"

1493
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:56,840
I asked.

1494
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,929
"Take your time."

1495
01:42:58,929 --> 01:43:01,020
"There is something.

1496
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:08,659
Last night, I was going through Alexei's wardrobe,
seeing what I could give away to charity.

1497
01:43:08,659 --> 01:43:15,840
In a jacket pocket, I found a piece of paper,
rolled up into a ball.

1498
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:21,610
It was a short message in Russian with no
date or address.

1499
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:30,469
It was a warning and just said: 'I am telling
you this in the strictest confidence.

1500
01:43:30,469 --> 01:43:33,330
Mossolov could be dangerous.

1501
01:43:33,330 --> 01:43:36,610
You don't know what you're getting involved
with.'

1502
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:39,540
It was signed 'Victor'."

1503
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:42,159
"You still have the note?"

1504
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:44,139
I asked.

1505
01:43:44,139 --> 01:43:48,320
Mrs. Romanov opened a desk drawer and took
out the note.

1506
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:51,880
"Does the name 'Victor' mean anything to you?"

1507
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:53,230
I asked.

1508
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:55,230
"No," she answered.

1509
01:43:55,230 --> 01:44:01,780
"Well, it could be Victor Kamenev who runs
a business by the name of Kamenev Finance,"

1510
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:03,250
I said.

1511
01:44:03,250 --> 01:44:06,021
"We'll have to check this out and get back
to you.

1512
01:44:06,021 --> 01:44:10,179
Have you informed the police about this?"

1513
01:44:10,179 --> 01:44:11,420
"No.

1514
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:14,840
There's just been so much on my mind..." she
began.

1515
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:21,409
"I'd advise you to let them have the note
immediately, but with your permission, I'd

1516
01:44:21,409 --> 01:44:29,000
rather you didn't tell the NYPD about Kamenev
until I've checked him out first."

1517
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,340
We left the house and made our way to the
Brighton Beach subway and took an express

1518
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:37,760
Q train back to Manhattan.

1519
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:44,489
At last some pieces of the puzzle seemed to
be falling into place, but we were still a

1520
01:44:44,489 --> 01:44:47,880
long way from the solution.

1521
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:51,099
We had another Russian connection.

1522
01:44:51,099 --> 01:44:57,390
I wanted to pay a surprise visit to Mr. Kamenev,
but I needed support.

1523
01:44:57,390 --> 01:45:00,480
We could be moving in deep, dangerous waters.

1524
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:08,739
I made a call on my cell phone to Joe Blaney,
an ex-NYPD colleague of mine.

1525
01:45:08,739 --> 01:45:12,849
Joe's also an ex-NYPD heavyweight boxing champion.

1526
01:45:12,849 --> 01:45:19,929
He retired a few years ago but still looks
impressively tough, tough enough to scare

1527
01:45:19,929 --> 01:45:22,810
people into cooperating.

1528
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:27,960
That's one good reason why he accompanies
me on any job where there's an element of

1529
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,400
risk.

1530
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:32,840
"Joe, I have some work for you.

1531
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:33,949
Are you busy?"

1532
01:45:33,949 --> 01:45:34,949
I asked.

1533
01:45:34,949 --> 01:45:38,179
"I got nothing on," said Joe.

1534
01:45:38,179 --> 01:45:45,369
"Meet me at McSorley's Ale House on East 7th
Street at three o'clock, this afternoon.

1535
01:45:45,369 --> 01:45:49,219
I'll give you all the details then."

1536
01:45:49,219 --> 01:45:54,820
Stella and I transferred to an uptown train
at Broadway and Lafayette, and got off at

1537
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:59,010
Astor Place in the middle of the East Village.

1538
01:45:59,010 --> 01:46:01,929
Joe joined us in the bar just before three.

1539
01:46:01,929 --> 01:46:09,929
I gave him a brief outline of the story so
far before we left for Kamenev's office.

1540
01:46:09,929 --> 01:46:15,830
On the stairs up to the office, old wallpaper
was peeling off the walls.

1541
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:20,349
On the upstairs landing, flattened cigarette
butts covered the floor.

1542
01:46:20,349 --> 01:46:24,719
"Elegant, huh?" muttered Joe.

1543
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:29,990
As we entered Kamenev's office, the contrast
couldn't have been greater.

1544
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:35,810
Inside, all was clean, neat, and tastefully
decorated.

1545
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:38,790
The floors were polished wood.

1546
01:46:38,790 --> 01:46:42,860
Everywhere was the latest in office technology.

1547
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:49,670
In response to our request to speak to Kamenev,
the receptionist said a little too automatically:

1548
01:46:49,670 --> 01:46:52,110
"You don't have an appointment.

1549
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:57,719
Sorry, but Mr. Kamenev is busy with a client."

1550
01:46:57,719 --> 01:47:01,750
There was no sound of conversation coming
from his office.

1551
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:05,340
"Seems awfully quiet in there.

1552
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:11,980
Would you tell him Nat Marley wants to speak
to him concerning Alexei Romanov."

1553
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:15,960
She gave me a sour look and picked up the
phone.

1554
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:22,139
She spoke briefly to him and then turned to
me and said, "Seems that Mr. Kamenev's not

1555
01:47:22,139 --> 01:47:24,469
so busy after all.

1556
01:47:24,469 --> 01:47:27,130
You can go in."

1557
01:47:27,130 --> 01:47:34,540
The guy behind the desk had to be Kamenev,
a big man with rosy cheeks, bushy moustache,

1558
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:37,840
and a full head of curly hair.

1559
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:43,250
You could see his reflection in the polished
wood of the large desk.

1560
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:48,910
Around the room were various framed photographs
of life in the old Russia from the nineteenth

1561
01:47:48,910 --> 01:47:50,060
century.

1562
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:52,380
"Mr. Kamenev?

1563
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:56,969
The name's Nat Marley, licensed private investigator.

1564
01:47:56,969 --> 01:48:03,010
This is my assistant Stella Delgado and my
colleague Joe Blaney.

1565
01:48:03,010 --> 01:48:05,510
I'll come straight to the point.

1566
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:09,949
I'm investigating the recent murder of Alexei
Romanov.

1567
01:48:09,949 --> 01:48:15,070
I believe you may have information concerning
who was responsible for the killing."

1568
01:48:15,070 --> 01:48:17,890
"I don't know anything.

1569
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:19,790
Who sent you here?"

1570
01:48:19,790 --> 01:48:23,190
demanded Kamenev nervously.

1571
01:48:23,190 --> 01:48:27,860
Kamenev suddenly opened a desk drawer and
produced an automatic pistol.

1572
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:32,869
He pointed it at me with a trembling hand.

1573
01:48:32,869 --> 01:48:35,560
Joe was equally quick.

1574
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:42,580
His old police special was pointing straight
at Kamenev, but his hand was rock steady.

1575
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:49,330
"Mr. Kamenev," said Joe smoothly, "it's obvious
you're no gunman.

1576
01:48:49,330 --> 01:48:51,750
Let's use some common sense.

1577
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:56,190
I suggest you put that gun down."

1578
01:48:56,190 --> 01:49:00,120
Kamenev sighed and placed the gun on the desk.

1579
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:06,920
Joe moved to the desk, and emptied the bullets
out of the weapon, then returned it to Kamenev.

1580
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:11,949
"Is it true that you sent a warning note to
Mr. Romanov?"

1581
01:49:11,949 --> 01:49:14,290
I asked.

1582
01:49:14,290 --> 01:49:17,900
Kamenev eyed us suspiciously from behind his
desk.

1583
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:25,099
"Before I say anything, I need to have a guarantee
that you are genuine," he said.

1584
01:49:25,099 --> 01:49:27,480
"By all means.

1585
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:34,840
I suggest you call Alexei Romanov's widow,"
I replied and gave him the number.

1586
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:38,860
A conversation in rapid Russian followed.

1587
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:43,230
After a while, he put the phone down and looked
at us.

1588
01:49:43,230 --> 01:49:45,449
"My apologies.

1589
01:49:45,449 --> 01:49:49,380
You understand I have to be cautious."

1590
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:52,489
I glanced around the room again.

1591
01:49:52,489 --> 01:49:56,869
There were also photographs of the old Russian
royal family.

1592
01:49:56,869 --> 01:50:01,639
Nicholas, the last of the Czars with Czarina
Alexandra.

1593
01:50:01,639 --> 01:50:05,360
"You obviously love your country.

1594
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:07,159
You must be a patriot.

1595
01:50:07,159 --> 01:50:11,290
Also, you must have been a friend of Alexei
Romanov.

1596
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:16,120
Who were you trying to protect him from?"

1597
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:18,050
Silence.

1598
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:26,050
After a long pause Kamenev spoke: "This is
very difficult for me, Mr. Marley.

1599
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:29,670
It's really not wise to say anything more.

1600
01:50:29,670 --> 01:50:34,659
If I were you I'd stay away from all this."

1601
01:50:34,659 --> 01:50:36,880
Kamenev looked uncomfortable.

1602
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:42,550
I wondered if he was too scared to talk, like
the bartenders at the Odessa Steps?

1603
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:47,310
I tried a different approach.

1604
01:50:47,310 --> 01:50:53,390
Kamenev's business could be benefiting from
the money coming in from the illegal immigrant

1605
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:54,639
operation.

1606
01:50:54,639 --> 01:50:58,340
I had no proof, but it was worth a try.

1607
01:50:58,340 --> 01:51:05,679
"I want to speak to you about some poor Russian
boys found dead on Jones Beach.

1608
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:10,840
I've heard a rumor that someone was laundering
the money these boys paid to get into the

1609
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:16,429
country, money that needed to be integrated
into the legal economy.

1610
01:51:16,429 --> 01:51:20,520
I understand that's your line of business."

1611
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,430
Kamenev remained silent.

1612
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:26,119
"Is money laundering part of your business?"

1613
01:51:26,119 --> 01:51:27,900
I insisted.

1614
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:30,510
Again Kamenev didn't say anything.

1615
01:51:30,510 --> 01:51:34,429
"Let's get one thing straight," I said.

1616
01:51:34,429 --> 01:51:41,489
"I'm sure there's a whole lot of questions
the IRS would love to ask about your accounts,

1617
01:51:41,489 --> 01:51:44,929
but I'm not investigating your business.

1618
01:51:44,929 --> 01:51:50,770
Let's get back to those poor young men who
were washed up on Jones Beach.

1619
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:55,929
Whoever launders the money those boys paid
to get into the country might as well have

1620
01:51:55,929 --> 01:52:00,650
held a gun to their heads and pulled the trigger.

1621
01:52:00,650 --> 01:52:03,630
Would it be you by any chance?

1622
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:09,510
You see, they died because they'd been put
in a boat that was falling apart.

1623
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:14,429
The boat split in two in the storm and they
drowned.

1624
01:52:14,429 --> 01:52:22,870
In some way you might share some responsibility
for the deaths of four good Russian boys."

1625
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:25,920
I could see Kamenev's lips tightening.

1626
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:29,550
I knew what I said had found its target.

1627
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:32,050
I was appealing to his sense of honor.

1628
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:36,889
I hoped and prayed there was some honor left
in him.

1629
01:52:36,889 --> 01:52:41,140
"Four good Russian boys," I repeated.

1630
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:48,179
"All they wanted was to enter the land of
opportunity and make a success of their lives.

1631
01:52:48,179 --> 01:52:51,110
And now they're dead.

1632
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:55,230
Their families back in Russia won't know what's
happened to them.

1633
01:52:55,230 --> 01:53:00,900
Maybe they saved up for years to give their
sons this chance.

1634
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:03,559
But you won't be out of pocket.

1635
01:53:03,559 --> 01:53:06,070
The money will still be coming in."

1636
01:53:06,070 --> 01:53:11,869
"Honest to God," stammered Kamenev, "I don't
ask questions!

1637
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:15,870
Their deaths couldn't be my fault."

1638
01:53:15,870 --> 01:53:19,869
"So you were just the honest money launderer,
huh?"

1639
01:53:19,869 --> 01:53:21,050
I asked.

1640
01:53:21,050 --> 01:53:26,369
"No questions asked and nothing on your conscience?"

1641
01:53:26,369 --> 01:53:28,110
Kamenev remained silent.

1642
01:53:28,110 --> 01:53:31,400
Sweat started to form on his forehead.

1643
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:37,699
"I have this feeling there's a connection
between Romanov's death and those boys found

1644
01:53:37,699 --> 01:53:40,469
drowned on Jones Beach.

1645
01:53:40,469 --> 01:53:42,389
You follow what I'm saying?"

1646
01:53:42,389 --> 01:53:43,580
I went on.

1647
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:47,640
He nodded, but his expression was blank.

1648
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:51,170
"I think you can help," I continued.

1649
01:53:51,170 --> 01:53:56,429
"Help us find the guys who sent those good
Russians to their deaths.

1650
01:53:56,429 --> 01:54:04,510
You're a patriot, and despite your line of
business, I believe you're a man of honor.

1651
01:54:04,510 --> 01:54:11,670
The most patriotic thing you could do is help
us to find whoever is exploiting honest Russian

1652
01:54:11,670 --> 01:54:13,270
people.

1653
01:54:13,270 --> 01:54:18,320
We also want to find who really killed Alexei
Romanov.

1654
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:24,260
That man did some fine work in the community,
helping Russian folks to settle here."

1655
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:27,079
He remained silent.

1656
01:54:27,079 --> 01:54:28,500
I nodded to Stella.

1657
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:31,340
"Tell him," I said to her.

1658
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:38,580
"Mr. Kamenev," Stella began, "our interest
in this case is also personal.

1659
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:45,590
My brother, Jose De La Cruz has been wrongly
accused of Alexei Romanov's murder.

1660
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:50,150
As far as the NYPD are concerned he's guilty.

1661
01:54:50,150 --> 01:54:55,480
We believe he was set up as the fall guy,
to take the blame.

1662
01:54:55,480 --> 01:55:03,250
We need someone who knows the Russian community,
someone who has the contacts and inside knowledge,

1663
01:55:03,250 --> 01:55:07,949
to help bring the real killers to justice.

1664
01:55:07,949 --> 01:55:12,410
Kamenev took a deep breath and pushed his
hands into his fists.

1665
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:19,980
"OK," said Kamenev, "I admit that in my work,
I don't ask too many questions.

1666
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:23,270
Cash arrives from anonymous clients.

1667
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:27,420
I only know them by a number.

1668
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:33,170
But if innocent Russian boys have been killed
and I've profited from it..."

1669
01:55:33,170 --> 01:55:35,110
I interrupted him.

1670
01:55:35,110 --> 01:55:40,460
"You still haven't told me why you sent the
warning note to Romanov.

1671
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:42,559
Who's Mossolov?"

1672
01:55:42,559 --> 01:55:50,110
"Mossolov runs some sort of operation in Brighton
Beach and contacts me from time to time to

1673
01:55:50,110 --> 01:55:53,540
expect a delivery of cash.

1674
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:59,820
We've never met, only exchanged coded emails
and faxes.

1675
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:06,160
Monday last week, Mossolov emailed me and
asked what I knew about Romanov.

1676
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:15,170
I asked why and the reply was that Romanov
had been asking inconvenient questions.

1677
01:56:15,170 --> 01:56:22,139
I didn't want to get involved, so I just played
it safe and denied any knowledge of Romanov,

1678
01:56:22,139 --> 01:56:24,620
except what's known publicly.

1679
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:32,150
I suspected that Mossolov was dangerous and
so Romanov could be in danger."

1680
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:35,429
"Thank you, Mr. Kamenev.

1681
01:56:35,429 --> 01:56:41,550
Our problem is that we still have to prove
who murdered Romanov," I said.

1682
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:50,829
"Mr. Marley, I am a patriot, and I feel I
owe a debt of honor towards my countrymen.

1683
01:56:50,829 --> 01:56:52,420
How can I help?"

1684
01:56:52,420 --> 01:56:57,840
"I'm going to set up a meeting with Alexei
Romanov's widow," I said.

1685
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:01,559
"I'd like you to be there.

1686
01:57:01,559 --> 01:57:07,790
Expect a call from me tomorrow morning.

1687
01:57:07,790 --> 01:57:12,550
CHAPTER TEN
Witness

1688
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:19,429
It was now just over a week since Alexei Romanov
had been found murdered.

1689
01:57:19,429 --> 01:57:25,389
People's memories tend to fade once events
become part of the distant past.

1690
01:57:25,389 --> 01:57:30,849
We needed to find witnesses while their memories
were still fresh.

1691
01:57:30,849 --> 01:57:36,099
Maybe the presence of Kamenev would help the
bartenders at the Odessa Steps to remember

1692
01:57:36,099 --> 01:57:38,690
more about Wednesday night.

1693
01:57:38,690 --> 01:57:46,619
I left Stella to do some phoning to set up
a meeting with Kamenev and Mrs. Romanov.

1694
01:57:46,619 --> 01:57:51,739
I suggested somewhere like a good restaurant
in the Brighton Beach area, but I left the

1695
01:57:51,739 --> 01:57:54,679
choice up to her.

1696
01:57:54,679 --> 01:57:58,909
I had received another Coast Guard press release.

1697
01:57:58,909 --> 01:58:02,619
Another body washed up on Jones Beach.

1698
01:58:02,619 --> 01:58:08,809
The details were similar to those of the other
victims: a male, in his twenties.

1699
01:58:08,809 --> 01:58:12,710
No form of identification on the body.

1700
01:58:12,710 --> 01:58:19,010
No definite connection could be made with
the previous fatalities on Jones Beach.

1701
01:58:19,010 --> 01:58:24,980
But if there was a connection, just how many
people had been on board that lifeboat when

1702
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:28,860
it left the ship for the Long Island shore?

1703
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:34,579
With the information about deaths of innocent
Russian boys, I didn't anticipate too much

1704
01:58:34,579 --> 01:58:40,770
difficulty in gaining the cooperation of the
citizens of Brighton Beach.

1705
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:45,309
I had just finished reading the press release
when the phone rang.

1706
01:58:45,309 --> 01:58:50,400
I recognized the elegant English accent - Edie
Tilden.

1707
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:57,000
"Mr. Marley, I've seen a very suspicious incident,
on Fire Island."

1708
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:03,400
Had I been wise to encourage that eccentric
old lady to play the investigator?

1709
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:06,679
"Tell me all about it," I said.

1710
01:59:06,679 --> 01:59:13,230
"I spent yesterday beachcombing along the
eastern tip of Fire Island.

1711
01:59:13,230 --> 01:59:20,210
And I saw this man who didn't look like he
really belonged on a beach," she said.

1712
01:59:20,210 --> 01:59:23,869
"What do you mean by 'didn't belong'?"

1713
01:59:23,869 --> 01:59:26,870
"He wasn't dressed properly.

1714
01:59:26,870 --> 01:59:29,119
Too formal.

1715
01:59:29,119 --> 01:59:33,940
He was wearing an overcoat over a gray suit.

1716
01:59:33,940 --> 01:59:36,250
Shiny black shoes.

1717
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:43,310
He was looking out at the ocean through binoculars,
but I don't think he was watching the wildlife."

1718
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:46,170
"Could you describe him?"

1719
01:59:46,170 --> 01:59:47,460
I asked.

1720
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:53,750
"Well, he was tall, six feet plus, with a
big build.

1721
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:59,210
But, you see, Mr. Marley, I saw all this from
a distance.

1722
01:59:59,210 --> 02:00:03,739
As soon as I got closer, he left."

1723
02:00:03,739 --> 02:00:07,970
Perhaps he was frightened by the sight of
Edie Tilden.

1724
02:00:07,970 --> 02:00:15,010
What she had witnessed could be relevant or
could have been entirely innocent.

1725
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:20,520
Fire Island is the next narrow strip of land
off the Long Island mainland, to the east

1726
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,639
of Jones Beach.

1727
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:31,440
Anyway, I stored away the information, thanked
her, and returned to our immediate concerns.

1728
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:37,670
Stella had made the necessary arrangements:
a midday meeting at Cafe Paris in Brighton

1729
02:00:37,670 --> 02:00:39,179
Beach.

1730
02:00:39,179 --> 02:00:44,679
A table had been booked, and Kamenev was on
his way to pick us up.

1731
02:00:44,679 --> 02:00:52,159
It would be a pleasant change to travel to
Brighton Beach by car instead of the subway.

1732
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:56,980
Things with Kamenev were now more relaxed,
so we were able to get to know one another

1733
02:00:56,980 --> 02:00:59,540
a little better.

1734
02:00:59,540 --> 02:01:07,030
Victor Kamenev's family, we learned, left
Russia and settled in America many years ago.

1735
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:12,929
Like many in the Russian-American community,
Russian was his first language, and he and

1736
02:01:12,929 --> 02:01:18,550
his relatives had remained true to their cultural
roots.

1737
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:22,949
The car was now leaving Manhattan, crossing
the Brooklyn Bridge.

1738
02:01:22,949 --> 02:01:31,199
Below, the wind was whipping up the waters
of the East River into white-tipped waves.

1739
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:38,080
Above us, on the footbridge, people were walking
into Manhattan, well wrapped-up against the

1740
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:39,809
cold.

1741
02:01:39,809 --> 02:01:46,050
Soon we were cruising along Flatbush Avenue,
with the skyscrapers of Manhattan fading into

1742
02:01:46,050 --> 02:01:48,300
the distance.

1743
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:51,400
The conversation turned to recent events.

1744
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:59,679
"Mr. Marley," Kamenev started, "I've been
thinking a lot about our conversation yesterday.

1745
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:03,969
I'll ask whatever questions you want me to.

1746
02:02:03,969 --> 02:02:08,610
I can put pressure on people and ask for favors.

1747
02:02:08,610 --> 02:02:12,810
There are people around Brighton Beach who
owe me money.

1748
02:02:12,810 --> 02:02:18,980
The prospect of negotiating a debt should
encourage someone to talk."

1749
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:23,360
The car was now rolling through the suburbs
of Brooklyn.

1750
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:27,010
The rest of the journey passed sociably.

1751
02:02:27,010 --> 02:02:32,809
On arriving at the Cafe Paris, we met Mrs.
Romanov, who was waiting in the reception

1752
02:02:32,809 --> 02:02:34,139
area.

1753
02:02:34,139 --> 02:02:38,650
We were taken over to our table where I made
the introductions.

1754
02:02:38,650 --> 02:02:41,280
"Mrs. Romanov.

1755
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:47,060
You've already met Stella and this is Mr.
Victor Kamenev.

1756
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:52,800
Mr. Kamenev is as anxious as you are to get
justice for your husband.

1757
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:56,659
Mr. Kamenev sent the warning note to your
late husband."

1758
02:02:56,659 --> 02:03:01,730
Not surprisingly, Mrs. Romanov looked extremely
tense.

1759
02:03:01,730 --> 02:03:06,650
After ordering, Mrs. Romanov questioned Kamenev.

1760
02:03:06,650 --> 02:03:10,040
A long conversation in Russian.

1761
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:15,309
To begin with, Mrs. Romanov's voice was sharp.

1762
02:03:15,309 --> 02:03:21,570
I held my breath and crossed my fingers, but
soon she sounded much friendlier.

1763
02:03:21,570 --> 02:03:24,099
I breathed out.

1764
02:03:24,099 --> 02:03:28,239
Then, they shook hands warmly.

1765
02:03:28,239 --> 02:03:30,460
Mrs. Romanov addressed everybody.

1766
02:03:30,460 --> 02:03:33,719
"I'm sorry about that.

1767
02:03:33,719 --> 02:03:38,100
I needed to be absolutely sure about Mr. Kamenev.

1768
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:42,110
Now, I feel I can trust him.

1769
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:45,179
This is a very difficult time for me.

1770
02:03:45,179 --> 02:03:50,460
It's little more than a week since poor Alexei
was so cruelly murdered.

1771
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:56,360
I want to thank you all very sincerely for
coming here.

1772
02:03:56,360 --> 02:04:01,380
Mr. Marley, I know you said your interest
in this case was personal.

1773
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:05,349
Naturally, mine is too.

1774
02:04:05,349 --> 02:04:11,260
I know you must have other work you should
be doing, and this investigation must be a

1775
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:12,830
considerable expense."

1776
02:04:12,830 --> 02:04:15,730
"Well, not really, ma'am..."

1777
02:04:15,730 --> 02:04:17,179
I began.

1778
02:04:17,179 --> 02:04:21,829
"Mr. Marley, you're a very poor liar.

1779
02:04:21,829 --> 02:04:26,320
I'm hiring you to find my husband's murderer.

1780
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:29,230
Whatever the cost."

1781
02:04:29,230 --> 02:04:32,000
I could certainly use the money.

1782
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:37,080
I hadn't done any other work since I'd heard
the news about Jose.

1783
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:41,610
And there was still the office rent, taxes,
and salaries to pay.

1784
02:04:41,610 --> 02:04:45,580
"Thank you, ma'am, I accept.

1785
02:04:45,580 --> 02:04:49,110
Stella will draw up a contract."

1786
02:04:49,110 --> 02:04:56,460
After a discussion over lunch, there seemed
to be two clear avenues of investigation.

1787
02:04:56,460 --> 02:04:58,080
One was the Odessa Steps.

1788
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:05,909
Having a member of the Russian community with
us could help to make some progress there.

1789
02:05:05,909 --> 02:05:12,580
The other avenue was Alexei Romanov's computer
files, particularly those concerning the Immigrant

1790
02:05:12,580 --> 02:05:15,690
Welfare Society.

1791
02:05:15,690 --> 02:05:21,340
Computer skills were Stella's specialty, so
she left with Mrs. Romanov to examine the

1792
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:25,620
computer, while I paid a visit to the bar
with Kamenev.

1793
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:31,739
When we arrived, the lunchtime crowd was building
up.

1794
02:05:31,739 --> 02:05:35,659
I took Victor over to the display of sports
souvenirs.

1795
02:05:35,659 --> 02:05:40,370
I showed him the baseball bat Jose had grabbed.

1796
02:05:40,370 --> 02:05:47,250
The bat was now securely fixed to the wall
with metal bands and strong screws.

1797
02:05:47,250 --> 02:05:53,680
I gave Kamenev all the background information
he might need about Jose's night out in Brighton

1798
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:55,360
Beach.

1799
02:05:55,360 --> 02:06:00,140
I recognized the bartender I'd spoken with
on my previous visit.

1800
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:04,020
He was laughing and joking with the regular
customers.

1801
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:09,730
His face dropped as soon as he saw me holding
up Jose's picture.

1802
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:11,510
"Remember me?"

1803
02:06:11,510 --> 02:06:12,510
I asked.

1804
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:18,010
"I was asking you about this guy who'd been
drinking here last Wednesday night.

1805
02:06:18,010 --> 02:06:23,139
His name's Jose and he's in a lot of trouble.

1806
02:06:23,139 --> 02:06:28,119
I got the impression you were suffering from
a little memory loss.

1807
02:06:28,119 --> 02:06:31,369
Or maybe you were just confused.

1808
02:06:31,369 --> 02:06:35,469
I've brought a friend along to help you remember."

1809
02:06:35,469 --> 02:06:38,140
The bartender stood there silently.

1810
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:41,179
Sweat started to form on his forehead.

1811
02:06:41,179 --> 02:06:46,500
He looked like a frightened animal, nervous
and vulnerable.

1812
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:48,670
"I didn't see nothing.

1813
02:06:48,670 --> 02:06:53,550
I swear I didn't see nothing," he repeated.

1814
02:06:53,550 --> 02:07:00,760
Meanwhile, a smartly dressed guy, who I took
to be the manager, joined the bartender.

1815
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:04,750
"What's going on here?" he asked.

1816
02:07:04,750 --> 02:07:08,590
"I'll have no harassment of my staff."

1817
02:07:08,590 --> 02:07:16,530
The moment he made eye contact with Kamenev,
the manager froze and lowered his head.

1818
02:07:16,530 --> 02:07:19,239
Victor spoke to him in Russian.

1819
02:07:19,239 --> 02:07:25,530
It sounded like a heated argument at first,
but tempers soon cooled.

1820
02:07:25,530 --> 02:07:32,139
The manager waved to the bartender who poured
drinks for Kamenev and myself.

1821
02:07:32,139 --> 02:07:38,579
"Mikhail, the bar manager, has just remembered
how much in debt he is to me.

1822
02:07:38,579 --> 02:07:44,070
I've offered to be flexible about the repayments,
provided we get some information.

1823
02:07:44,070 --> 02:07:48,980
Shall we move into your office, Mikhail?"

1824
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:54,559
The bartender told us that Jose had woken
up in the bar alone.

1825
02:07:54,559 --> 02:07:57,469
He was sleepy and confused.

1826
02:07:57,469 --> 02:08:05,809
He stood up, reached out an arm, grabbed the
baseball bat, fell over and just lay there.

1827
02:08:05,809 --> 02:08:09,250
The regular customers at the bar were very
offended.

1828
02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:14,610
Who was this guy damaging the sacred bat?

1829
02:08:14,610 --> 02:08:20,810
Before anyone could lay a hand on him, someone
else had got involved and protected Jose from

1830
02:08:20,810 --> 02:08:23,539
the furious regulars.

1831
02:08:23,539 --> 02:08:29,510
This guy had taken pity on him and said he'd
help get him home.

1832
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:33,280
I was getting very interested indeed.

1833
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:38,739
There were a whole lot of questions I needed
to ask via Kamenev's interpreting.

1834
02:08:38,739 --> 02:08:42,010
"The guy who helped Jose.

1835
02:08:42,010 --> 02:08:43,010
Name?"

1836
02:08:43,010 --> 02:08:44,770
I asked.

1837
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:50,659
The bartender paused and looked fearfully
toward his boss, who nodded his permission.

1838
02:08:50,659 --> 02:08:54,140
"He's called Nick Zernov.

1839
02:08:54,140 --> 02:08:58,159
If you know what's good for you, you'll stay
clear of him.

1840
02:08:58,159 --> 02:09:01,539
He's a real bad guy."

1841
02:09:01,539 --> 02:09:07,170
That explained why he had the power to protect
Jose from an angry crowd.

1842
02:09:07,170 --> 02:09:15,090
Zernov had seen the opportunity to use Jose
as the fall guy to make Jose appear guilty

1843
02:09:15,090 --> 02:09:16,580
for a murder.

1844
02:09:16,580 --> 02:09:22,699
"Give me a full description of Zernov, will
you," I asked.

1845
02:09:22,699 --> 02:09:25,969
"Tall, over six feet, and muscular.

1846
02:09:25,969 --> 02:09:29,690
Black hair cut really short.

1847
02:09:29,690 --> 02:09:32,500
Thick black eyebrows.

1848
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:35,980
His nose looks like someone broke it.

1849
02:09:35,980 --> 02:09:40,429
Likes to wear expensive suits, shiny material."

1850
02:09:40,429 --> 02:09:46,770
I experienced that thrill you get when you
realize some parts of the puzzle might at

1851
02:09:46,770 --> 02:09:49,159
last be fitting together.

1852
02:09:49,159 --> 02:09:55,329
I recalled Edie Tilden's description of the
guy she'd seen on Fire Island.

1853
02:09:55,329 --> 02:10:00,710
I had to remind myself not to get over-excited.

1854
02:10:00,710 --> 02:10:04,030
We still had nothing concrete yet.

1855
02:10:04,030 --> 02:10:06,280
I continued with the questioning.

1856
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:09,270
"How drunk was Jose?

1857
02:10:09,270 --> 02:10:10,610
Could he stand up?"

1858
02:10:10,610 --> 02:10:17,219
"He was a bit unsteady after Zernov picked
him up, but otherwise OK.

1859
02:10:17,219 --> 02:10:22,659
He had a few more drinks and then Zernov took
him outside.

1860
02:10:22,659 --> 02:10:26,719
That's all I know," the bartender said.

1861
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:31,429
"You know this guy Jose is facing a murder
charge.

1862
02:10:31,429 --> 02:10:35,420
They think he killed Alexei Romanov.

1863
02:10:35,420 --> 02:10:38,960
Jose was just a harmless drunk.

1864
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:43,449
I don't believe he is the killer," I said.

1865
02:10:43,449 --> 02:10:47,179
The name Romanov meant something to the bartender.

1866
02:10:47,179 --> 02:10:49,090
His face brightened.

1867
02:10:49,090 --> 02:10:53,539
"Mr. Romanov helped me and my family.

1868
02:10:53,539 --> 02:10:56,800
Such a good man."

1869
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,810
I had a final question.

1870
02:10:58,810 --> 02:11:04,840
"Would you be prepared to tell the police
what you've just told us?"

1871
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:09,590
Another discussion in Russian between Kamenev
and the bartender.

1872
02:11:09,590 --> 02:11:13,400
The bartender frowned and shook his head.

1873
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:18,300
Then he said something, almost in a whisper.

1874
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:23,079
Before I got the translation, I knew it meant
'No'.

1875
02:11:23,079 --> 02:11:29,989
The bartender was clearly terrified.

1876
02:11:29,989 --> 02:11:35,000
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Progress

1877
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:41,670
It was time to see how Stella had been doing
at the Romanov house with the computer files.

1878
02:11:41,670 --> 02:11:47,960
As Kamenev's car rolled along Shore Boulevard,
I was thinking about the case.

1879
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:50,329
I told Kamenev my theory.

1880
02:11:50,329 --> 02:11:57,460
"Victor, I think we have enough new information
to encourage the police to follow a new line

1881
02:11:57,460 --> 02:11:58,610
of investigation.

1882
02:11:58,610 --> 02:12:06,070
We now know that Jose left the bar with a
guy who has local criminal connections.

1883
02:12:06,070 --> 02:12:11,780
Zernov doesn't sound like the type of guy
who'd rescue someone from a beating purely

1884
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:16,460
out of warm, sympathetic feelings toward his
fellow men.

1885
02:12:16,460 --> 02:12:23,440
So my theory is that Zernov saw an opportunity
to use Jose as the fall guy."

1886
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:27,920
"But what about all the evidence against your
client?

1887
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:29,360
The forensics?

1888
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:32,230
And the murder weapon?" asked Kamenev.

1889
02:12:32,230 --> 02:12:37,820
"It'd be quite easy for Zernov to kill Romanov,"
I explained.

1890
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:45,120
"Then, for him to wipe the gun clean, grip
Jose's hand around it, leaving his fingerprints

1891
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:47,219
on the gun.

1892
02:12:47,219 --> 02:12:52,679
Even easier to do if Jose was already unconscious."

1893
02:12:52,679 --> 02:12:56,010
Back at the house, Stella had found something.

1894
02:12:56,010 --> 02:13:00,330
A file protected by a password.

1895
02:13:00,330 --> 02:13:07,420
Whatever she tried, family names or place
names, she couldn't open the file.

1896
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:10,039
I glanced around the room.

1897
02:13:10,039 --> 02:13:14,000
There were a number of photographs of old
Russia.

1898
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:20,020
Opposite the desk was a picture of a wide
avenue in a major city.

1899
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:23,409
Mrs. Romanov noticed me studying the picture.

1900
02:13:23,409 --> 02:13:28,600
"Poor Alexei loved that street scene," she
said.

1901
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:33,940
"It's the Nevsky Prospekt in old St. Petersburg.

1902
02:13:33,940 --> 02:13:36,570
That's an idea!

1903
02:13:36,570 --> 02:13:40,500
Why don't you try typing in 'Nevsky Prospekt'."

1904
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:46,199
"Could you spell that out for me?" asked Stella.

1905
02:13:46,199 --> 02:13:50,470
Again, the computer denied us access.

1906
02:13:50,470 --> 02:13:56,270
Stella keyed in the words individually, but
still no success.

1907
02:13:56,270 --> 02:13:59,090
Mrs. Romanov had another suggestion.

1908
02:13:59,090 --> 02:14:05,570
"That street is named after the Russian national
hero, Alexander Nevsky.

1909
02:14:05,570 --> 02:14:10,960
Try his name," suggested Mrs. Romanov.

1910
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:13,230
Stella keyed in the words.

1911
02:14:13,230 --> 02:14:17,320
This time the protected file opened.

1912
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:24,220
There were lists of dates going back over
the past two years at regular intervals.

1913
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:30,110
Next to some of the dates were Russian names,
sometimes with local addresses.

1914
02:14:30,110 --> 02:14:35,710
By some of the names there was a capital 'M'
with a question mark.

1915
02:14:35,710 --> 02:14:40,099
The most recent date was last Friday.

1916
02:14:40,099 --> 02:14:46,710
There were also a couple of future dates with
an 'M?' next to them.

1917
02:14:46,710 --> 02:14:50,500
The first of these was Saturday March 16th.

1918
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:55,659
"What do you make of that?" asked Stella.

1919
02:14:55,659 --> 02:15:02,050
"Well, 'M' could stand for Mossolov," said
Kamenev.

1920
02:15:02,050 --> 02:15:03,610
"OK.

1921
02:15:03,610 --> 02:15:10,530
If we assume that Zernov works for Mossolov,"
I said, "and if we can find out what sort

1922
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:18,469
of operation Mossolov is running, then things
should fall into place."

1923
02:15:18,469 --> 02:15:23,570
Mrs. Romanov had been examining the names
and dates in the computer file.

1924
02:15:23,570 --> 02:15:28,659
"Mr. Marley, I know some of these names.

1925
02:15:28,659 --> 02:15:33,840
Some of them are people who Alexei helped
through the Immigrant Welfare Society.

1926
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:42,050
This one here, Boris Tchernov, I know he entered
the country illegally.

1927
02:15:42,050 --> 02:15:48,080
Could Mossolov be smuggling in Russian immigrants?

1928
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:51,390
Could these be the dates when they were brought
in?"

1929
02:15:51,390 --> 02:15:56,840
"It's possible, but we'd still need more proof,"
I answered.

1930
02:15:56,840 --> 02:16:02,929
"I'd like to talk to Tchernov, but it would
be helpful if you would accompany me, Mrs.

1931
02:16:02,929 --> 02:16:06,790
Romanov, so there's someone he knows and trusts.

1932
02:16:06,790 --> 02:16:09,929
But that will have to wait until tomorrow.

1933
02:16:09,929 --> 02:16:14,539
It's time I had another talk with Captain
Oldenberg.

1934
02:16:14,539 --> 02:16:20,789
Stella, would you print me out a couple of
hard copies of that file?"

1935
02:16:20,789 --> 02:16:27,530
We said our goodbyes to Mrs. Romanov and left
with Kamenev in his car.

1936
02:16:27,530 --> 02:16:32,120
Kamenev dropped us off at Police Plaza in
Manhattan.

1937
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:36,301
A sergeant led us to Oldenberg's office.

1938
02:16:36,301 --> 02:16:41,099
Oldenberg was sitting with his feet up on
the desk and didn't bother to remove them

1939
02:16:41,099 --> 02:16:43,219
when we entered.

1940
02:16:43,219 --> 02:16:48,120
"Please don't stand up just for us, Oldenberg,"
I said.

1941
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:51,500
"What made you think I would?"

1942
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:52,969
growled the captain.

1943
02:16:52,969 --> 02:16:55,719
"I don't suppose you want some coffee."

1944
02:16:55,719 --> 02:17:03,500
"Thanks for the hospitality, but if it's NYPD
coffee we'll do without it."

1945
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:05,650
"Sensible decision.

1946
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:13,979
Now what can I do for you, Marley?" he asked,
at last removing his feet from the desk.

1947
02:17:13,979 --> 02:17:20,050
There was the usual expression on the captain's
face which seemed to say that life and work

1948
02:17:20,050 --> 02:17:25,170
were an annoyance, and I wasn't making things
any better.

1949
02:17:25,170 --> 02:17:27,689
It was time to get him interested.

1950
02:17:27,689 --> 02:17:32,740
"The Odessa Steps, Brighton Beach," I began.

1951
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:39,029
"You remember I told you that Jose pulled
that baseball bat off the wall and then got

1952
02:17:39,029 --> 02:17:41,349
out of that bar unharmed?

1953
02:17:41,349 --> 02:17:45,630
Well, the reason was that he had a protector."

1954
02:17:45,630 --> 02:17:48,849
"Go on, Marley.

1955
02:17:48,849 --> 02:17:52,160
You're beginning to interest me," said Oldenberg.

1956
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:59,240
"I also got a witness, but I doubt whether
he'd give a statement to the police.

1957
02:17:59,240 --> 02:18:04,320
A bartender saw Jose leave the bar with a
big, smartly dressed guy.

1958
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:08,330
We have a name - Nick Zernov.

1959
02:18:08,330 --> 02:18:11,389
He's part of a local gang."

1960
02:18:11,389 --> 02:18:16,350
"How do you spell that?" asked the captain.

1961
02:18:16,350 --> 02:18:22,490
There was a rare burst of energy from Oldenberg
as he swung around in his chair to the computer

1962
02:18:22,490 --> 02:18:25,240
and typed in the name.

1963
02:18:25,240 --> 02:18:31,320
A list of names came up on the screen, including
a Nicholai Zernov.

1964
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:40,130
"He's known as Nick, so this Nicholai could
be the guy," I suggested.

1965
02:18:40,130 --> 02:18:42,460
Oldenberg opened the file.

1966
02:18:42,460 --> 02:18:46,660
The photo matched the bartender's description.

1967
02:18:46,660 --> 02:18:49,940
Zernov had a long criminal record.

1968
02:18:49,940 --> 02:18:55,490
Like the bartender in the Odessa Steps had
said, he was a guy to avoid.

1969
02:18:55,490 --> 02:19:02,780
He'd been charged with murder but found not
guilty and had served a four-year prison sentence

1970
02:19:02,780 --> 02:19:04,769
for robbery.

1971
02:19:04,769 --> 02:19:11,029
"Oldenberg, I'm positive that's the guy who
killed Romanov," I said.

1972
02:19:11,029 --> 02:19:15,229
"Would you print me out a couple of copies
of the picture?"

1973
02:19:15,229 --> 02:19:19,389
"So if he is, where's your proof?"

1974
02:19:19,389 --> 02:19:21,149
demanded Oldenberg.

1975
02:19:21,149 --> 02:19:25,020
"I don't have anything to charge him with."

1976
02:19:25,020 --> 02:19:29,760
"Well, let's provide you with more new evidence,"
I continued.

1977
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:36,719
"You already know about the warning note which
Mrs. Romanov found in her husband's jacket.

1978
02:19:36,719 --> 02:19:43,719
I've found the guy who wrote it - a Victor
Kamenev, who owns Kamenev Finance.

1979
02:19:43,719 --> 02:19:48,490
He has a lot of contacts in the Russian community.

1980
02:19:48,490 --> 02:19:54,880
He discovered that Romanov had been doing
some personal investigation into what could

1981
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:59,271
be an illegal immigrant-smuggling operation.

1982
02:19:59,271 --> 02:20:05,270
But his questions had really bothered someone
by the name of Mossolov.

1983
02:20:05,270 --> 02:20:11,170
Kamenev knew Mossolov was angry, so he sent
the warning note to Romanov."

1984
02:20:11,170 --> 02:20:17,180
"OK, let's check to see if there's anything
on this Mossolov," said Oldenberg.

1985
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:21,920
He typed in the name, but the screen remained
blank.

1986
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:25,050
He paused and thought for a moment.

1987
02:20:25,050 --> 02:20:30,970
"If I'm going to charge Zernov, I need solid
evidence.

1988
02:20:30,970 --> 02:20:37,510
We have nothing on him except for the fact
he left the Odessa Steps with De La Cruz.

1989
02:20:37,510 --> 02:20:43,220
It'll be easier to find evidence against Zernov
if he's under the impression that De La Cruz

1990
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:45,270
is charged with murder.

1991
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:48,330
You see where this is leading, Marley?"

1992
02:20:48,330 --> 02:20:56,200
"You mean the official NYPD line is that Jose
is the killer, case closed.

1993
02:20:56,200 --> 02:21:02,890
The unofficial line is that the investigation
quietly continues," I suggested.

1994
02:21:02,890 --> 02:21:05,520
"You got it," said Oldenberg.

1995
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:13,140
"I'll have a police surveillance team watch
Zernov's movements without being seen."

1996
02:21:13,140 --> 02:21:15,950
Suddenly Stellas cell phone rang.

1997
02:21:15,950 --> 02:21:18,650
She rushed out into the hallway to answer
it.

1998
02:21:18,650 --> 02:21:25,350
There was a scream of joy followed by rapid
Spanish conversation.

1999
02:21:25,350 --> 02:21:30,810
She rushed back in to the room with tears
in her eyes and grinning broadly.

2000
02:21:30,810 --> 02:21:31,810
"Nat!

2001
02:21:31,810 --> 02:21:34,460
That was Mom.

2002
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:37,590
Jose's going to be all right.

2003
02:21:37,590 --> 02:21:43,290
He regained consciousness this afternoon and
he's been talking to her.

2004
02:21:43,290 --> 02:21:46,640
The doctors think the operation was a success."

2005
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:49,220
"That's great news, Stella.

2006
02:21:49,220 --> 02:21:55,000
Now if you'll excuse us, Oldenberg, we need
to get over to the hospital."

2007
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,359
"OK, Marley," said Oldenberg.

2008
02:21:57,359 --> 02:22:04,521
"I'll call the guard and tell him to expect
you."

2009
02:22:04,521 --> 02:22:08,020
The rush hour traffic was crawling through
Manhattan.

2010
02:22:08,020 --> 02:22:16,060
To avoid the chaos on the streets, we took
the subway uptown from City Hall to 103rd

2011
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:17,060
Street.

2012
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:22,810
From there it was only a few blocks walk to
the hospital.

2013
02:22:22,810 --> 02:22:24,670
Stella ran on ahead.

2014
02:22:24,670 --> 02:22:31,680
I finally reached Jose's room, and through
the window saw Stella sitting beside the bed

2015
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:34,529
smiling at Jose.

2016
02:22:34,529 --> 02:22:37,649
I knocked softly on the door.

2017
02:22:37,649 --> 02:22:39,840
Stella came out into the hall.

2018
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:45,320
"Nat," said Stella, "strict orders from the
nurse.

2019
02:22:45,320 --> 02:22:48,290
Don't get Jose over-excited.

2020
02:22:48,290 --> 02:22:52,010
He can talk but it's all a big effort.

2021
02:22:52,010 --> 02:22:54,990
He just needs plenty of rest.

2022
02:22:54,990 --> 02:22:58,800
We've only been allowed ten minutes."

2023
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:01,710
Jose recognized me as I walked in.

2024
02:23:01,710 --> 02:23:06,359
"Nat, thanks for what you did on the roof.

2025
02:23:06,359 --> 02:23:10,140
It's all a bit vague, but I'm told you saved
my life."

2026
02:23:10,140 --> 02:23:13,570
"Don't worry," I replied.

2027
02:23:13,570 --> 02:23:16,140
"Everything's OK now."

2028
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:21,660
"What do you mean 'OK'?" he asked, trying
to sit up in bed.

2029
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:23,960
"I'm facing a murder charge!"

2030
02:23:23,960 --> 02:23:26,880
"Come on, Jose.

2031
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:30,750
Just lie down and try to relax," said Stella.

2032
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:33,810
"You've got to rest."

2033
02:23:33,810 --> 02:23:38,120
She smiled at him and gently stroked his hand.

2034
02:23:38,120 --> 02:23:42,980
As soon as Jose was calmer, I spoke to him
again.

2035
02:23:42,980 --> 02:23:46,770
"Jose, we've spent the last week investigating.

2036
02:23:46,770 --> 02:23:51,270
We're turning up new evidence all the time.

2037
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:52,590
Just trust us.

2038
02:23:52,590 --> 02:23:57,350
We're doing everything possible to clear your
name.

2039
02:23:57,350 --> 02:24:00,649
I want you to concentrate on recovering.

2040
02:24:00,649 --> 02:24:03,020
Be a good patient."

2041
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:07,260
"Nat, I can remember something," said Jose.

2042
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:13,430
"When I woke up in the bar, Miguel and Carlos
weren't around.

2043
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:16,939
I stood up but lost my balance.

2044
02:24:16,939 --> 02:24:22,640
I reached out and grabbed the first thing
I saw to stop myself from falling.

2045
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:26,210
It came off in my hand.

2046
02:24:26,210 --> 02:24:33,560
Then there I was, lying on the floor with
all these angry guys looking at me.

2047
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:36,800
I can't remember what happened after that."

2048
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:40,271
"Thanks, Jose," I said.

2049
02:24:40,271 --> 02:24:43,479
It was time to leave Jose to rest.

2050
02:24:43,479 --> 02:24:48,500
I succeeded in persuading Stella to go home.

2051
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:55,060
Before going back to Queens, I thought I should
stop by at East 43rd Street to check if there

2052
02:24:55,060 --> 02:24:56,899
had been any messages.

2053
02:24:56,899 --> 02:25:02,180
An email had arrived from Commander Lockhart
of the U.S. Coast Guard.

2054
02:25:02,180 --> 02:25:04,540
It read:

2055
02:25:04,540 --> 02:25:05,540
Dear Mr. Marley

2056
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:10,260
Please contact me as soon as possible.

2057
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:16,420
We have some new evidence here that may be
connected with the wrecked lifeboat and fatalities

2058
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:18,840
at Jones Beach.

2059
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:24,790
It's a Russian fishing boat, which was wrecked
on Jones Beach last night.

2060
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:27,470
I'd like to show it to you.

2061
02:25:27,470 --> 02:25:30,180
Best wishes Jim Lockhart

2062
02:25:30,180 --> 02:25:35,250
Commander, U.S. Coast Guard Group Moriches

2063
02:25:35,250 --> 02:25:38,500
I was very interested indeed.

2064
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:44,330
I called Lockhart immediately to confirm that
I would be there in the morning.

2065
02:25:44,330 --> 02:25:47,510
Enough investigating for one day.

2066
02:25:47,510 --> 02:25:52,380
It was time to go home.

2067
02:25:52,380 --> 02:25:58,490
CHAPTER TWELVE
Wreck on Jones Beach

2068
02:25:58,490 --> 02:26:04,330
After the recent storms, the weather was now
calmer, with the prospect of spring in the

2069
02:26:04,330 --> 02:26:06,030
air.

2070
02:26:06,030 --> 02:26:11,710
I'd called Stella to tell her I was on my
way to Jones Beach to inspect the fishing

2071
02:26:11,710 --> 02:26:15,530
boat that Lockhart had told me about.

2072
02:26:15,530 --> 02:26:23,090
Stella's instructions were for her to set
up a meeting with Mrs. Romanov that afternoon.

2073
02:26:23,090 --> 02:26:28,979
Lockhart had arranged to meet me at Babylon
Station on the Long Island Rail Road, then

2074
02:26:28,979 --> 02:26:36,160
to take me across the bay to the eastern end
of Jones Beach to the site of the wreck.

2075
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:39,400
It was an ancient-looking rusty boat.

2076
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:45,710
The force of the storm had driven it sideways
onto the beach above the normal high-tide

2077
02:26:45,710 --> 02:26:46,710
mark.

2078
02:26:46,710 --> 02:26:52,750
It lay there on the sand and stones, leaning
at a slight angle.

2079
02:26:52,750 --> 02:26:55,660
Barriers had been set up around the boat.

2080
02:26:55,660 --> 02:27:01,070
A Coast Guard officer stood by a ladder leading
up to the deck.

2081
02:27:01,070 --> 02:27:06,440
On board, Lockhart gave me the full story
of what had happened.

2082
02:27:06,440 --> 02:27:12,010
The previous day, in the early evening, the
boat had been reported to the Coast Guard

2083
02:27:12,010 --> 02:27:17,390
by a local fishing boat as a potential danger
to shipping.

2084
02:27:17,390 --> 02:27:23,670
Its engine had failed and it was drifting
helplessly off Jones Beach.

2085
02:27:23,670 --> 02:27:27,220
No emergency signals had been received.

2086
02:27:27,220 --> 02:27:33,520
The crew of the local boat had tried to assist,
but the offer of help was rejected.

2087
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:37,430
"Have a good look around," said Lockhart.

2088
02:27:37,430 --> 02:27:39,560
"Tell me what you think."

2089
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:46,760
I'm no sailor, but I wouldn't have felt confident
out in the ocean in that boat.

2090
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:53,140
It had been some time since anybody had gone
fishing in this floating wreck.

2091
02:27:53,140 --> 02:27:56,120
I stuck my head into a cabin.

2092
02:27:56,120 --> 02:28:02,810
On a table lay U.S. Navy charts for the south
Long Island coast and New York Harbor.

2093
02:28:02,810 --> 02:28:06,010
"See those charts?" said Lockhart.

2094
02:28:06,010 --> 02:28:08,050
"They're all up-to-date."

2095
02:28:08,050 --> 02:28:11,020
"What about the crew?"

2096
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:12,040
I asked.

2097
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:15,979
"All four crew members were captured.

2098
02:28:15,979 --> 02:28:22,510
The boat was kept under observation by a helicopter
from the Cape Cod Air Station.

2099
02:28:22,510 --> 02:28:28,410
As you know, there's easy road access to Jones
Beach, so we picked them up as soon as the

2100
02:28:28,410 --> 02:28:30,480
boat was wrecked.

2101
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:33,220
They were carrying Russian identification.

2102
02:28:33,220 --> 02:28:40,300
They claim they don't understand a word of
English, so we've arranged for an interpreter.

2103
02:28:40,300 --> 02:28:44,930
Whether we get anything out of them is another
matter.

2104
02:28:44,930 --> 02:28:50,170
They've been taken to the Coast Guard First
District headquarters."

2105
02:28:50,170 --> 02:28:52,979
Lockhart led me down below deck.

2106
02:28:52,979 --> 02:28:59,390
There were a series of cabins fitted with
beds with cheap nylon sleeping bags.

2107
02:28:59,390 --> 02:29:02,229
There were signs of recent occupation.

2108
02:29:02,229 --> 02:29:05,310
The air smelled of stale tobacco.

2109
02:29:05,310 --> 02:29:12,870
On the floor lay Russian magazines, playing
cards, smashed plates and cups, and the remains

2110
02:29:12,870 --> 02:29:14,420
of a meal.

2111
02:29:14,420 --> 02:29:22,899
"According to my calculations, there's accommodation
down here for fifteen people plus crew," said

2112
02:29:22,899 --> 02:29:23,899
Lockhart.

2113
02:29:23,899 --> 02:29:30,340
"This could be the boat that those poor Russian
boys were in, but I can't prove anything."

2114
02:29:30,340 --> 02:29:34,529
"Five bodies so far.

2115
02:29:34,529 --> 02:29:41,029
So if they had been shipped here on this boat
there are potentially more fatalities?"

2116
02:29:41,029 --> 02:29:42,470
I asked.

2117
02:29:42,470 --> 02:29:43,720
"Yes.

2118
02:29:43,720 --> 02:29:49,380
It's unlikely there would have been any survivors
from the lifeboat," said Lockhart.

2119
02:29:49,380 --> 02:29:53,090
I accompanied Lockhart up to the bridge.

2120
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:57,210
Inside, it was full of sophisticated equipment.

2121
02:29:57,210 --> 02:30:03,810
"The boat may look like a wreck, but they've
installed the latest satellite navigation

2122
02:30:03,810 --> 02:30:05,990
system," explained Lockhart.

2123
02:30:05,990 --> 02:30:08,810
"Look at this little device.

2124
02:30:08,810 --> 02:30:12,680
It gives you your exact position wherever
you are.

2125
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:19,660
My theory is the appearance of this boat is
a deliberate disguise.

2126
02:30:19,660 --> 02:30:23,270
From a distance, it looks like any other fishing
boat.

2127
02:30:23,270 --> 02:30:28,630
A perfect cover for smuggling in illegal immigrants.

2128
02:30:28,630 --> 02:30:34,490
No ship's log, though, so we have no record
of the boat's movements.

2129
02:30:34,490 --> 02:30:40,230
If you come outside, there's one last thing
to show you."

2130
02:30:40,230 --> 02:30:41,990
Lockhart took me outside.

2131
02:30:41,990 --> 02:30:44,260
"Look," he said.

2132
02:30:44,260 --> 02:30:46,540
"The lifeboat's missing.

2133
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:53,200
But I can't prove yet that the lifeboat wrecked
on the beach came from this boat."

2134
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:59,840
"So if you have this boat, does that mean
it's the end of the smuggling operation?"

2135
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:00,840
I asked.

2136
02:31:00,840 --> 02:31:03,910
"We can't tell," he replied.

2137
02:31:03,910 --> 02:31:09,080
"It wouldn't surprise me if they had several
boats operating.

2138
02:31:09,080 --> 02:31:16,910
Also, we have no idea how many smuggling operations
are active at one time.

2139
02:31:16,910 --> 02:31:23,670
We're going to double Coast Guard patrols
off the south Long Island shore."

2140
02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:29,270
Back in Lockhart's car, I showed him the document
from Romanov's computer file.

2141
02:31:29,270 --> 02:31:32,779
"Take a look at these dates," I said.

2142
02:31:32,779 --> 02:31:38,161
"Are there any connections with incidents
reported to the Coast Guard or that the Coast

2143
02:31:38,161 --> 02:31:41,520
Guard has been involved with?"

2144
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:48,689
After examining the list of dates carefully,
Lockhart said: "Yes, there's a definite pattern

2145
02:31:48,689 --> 02:31:50,130
here.

2146
02:31:50,130 --> 02:31:52,189
Some of these dates match up.

2147
02:31:52,189 --> 02:31:55,069
Where did you get this information?"

2148
02:31:55,069 --> 02:32:03,260
"From the computer files of an Alexei Romanov,
who was found brutally murdered last week.

2149
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:10,490
I'm reasonably sure he was doing his own investigation
of an immigrant smuggling operation.

2150
02:32:10,490 --> 02:32:17,130
He must have asked too many awkward questions
and paid the price."

2151
02:32:17,130 --> 02:32:23,290
Lockhart pointed to the final date on the
list, which was the next day, Saturday March

2152
02:32:23,290 --> 02:32:24,560
16th.

2153
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:31,939
"This could indicate another delivery of immigrants
will arrive tomorrow."

2154
02:32:31,939 --> 02:32:38,351
I told Lockhart about what Edie Tilden had
seen at the Fire Island - the big smartly

2155
02:32:38,351 --> 02:32:42,279
dressed guy looking out to sea through binoculars.

2156
02:32:42,279 --> 02:32:50,439
"Of course, it could be nothing," I said,
"but I suspect he was checking out Fire Island

2157
02:32:50,439 --> 02:32:54,470
as a possible landing point."

2158
02:32:54,470 --> 02:32:58,010
Lockhart unfolded a map of the Long Island
beaches.

2159
02:32:58,010 --> 02:33:03,859
"Let's suppose that a boat is going to be
landed on Fire Island.

2160
02:33:03,859 --> 02:33:10,390
There are lots of beaches but very limited
road access across the bay.

2161
02:33:10,390 --> 02:33:18,069
Any vehicle would have to return via Jones
Beach from this point at the tip of Fire Island,

2162
02:33:18,069 --> 02:33:24,060
and then there are only three points of access
back to Long Island.

2163
02:33:24,060 --> 02:33:26,100
They'd be caught like rats in a trap."

2164
02:33:26,100 --> 02:33:35,852
"Maybe, but you still wouldn't catch whoever's
in charge of the whole operation," I commented.

2165
02:33:35,852 --> 02:33:41,640
Lockhart thought for a moment, then said,
"I'll have to contact my superior officer

2166
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:43,310
and talk this over.

2167
02:33:43,310 --> 02:33:52,650
I think the immediate plan of action should
be a joint Coast Guard and NYPD operation."

2168
02:33:52,650 --> 02:33:55,180
Lockhart dropped me off at Babylon Station.

2169
02:33:55,180 --> 02:34:03,560
I phoned ahead to Stella and arranged to meet
her at Cafe Paris on Brighton Beach Avenue.

2170
02:34:03,560 --> 02:34:08,770
She had already set up a meeting with Mrs.
Romanov at her home.

2171
02:34:08,770 --> 02:34:15,170
We had names and addresses of people from
Alexei Romanov's computer file.

2172
02:34:15,170 --> 02:34:22,479
To make any progress we would need Mrs. Romanov
with us because of her status in the Russian

2173
02:34:22,479 --> 02:34:24,590
community.

2174
02:34:24,590 --> 02:34:27,840
Stella was looking more bright and cheerful.

2175
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:35,420
The fact that Jose was at last on the road
to recovery must have been a huge relief.

2176
02:34:35,420 --> 02:34:41,430
Just as we were about to leave the restaurant
to see Mrs. Romanov, there was a call from

2177
02:34:41,430 --> 02:34:42,840
Kamenev.

2178
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:51,200
He'd been doing some research and had discovered
a company called 'Mossolov Import and Export.'

2179
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:57,819
In my experience, a business which describes
its function as 'import and export' could

2180
02:34:57,819 --> 02:35:00,100
mean anything.

2181
02:35:00,100 --> 02:35:06,859
It was a conveniently vague term that could
apply to any number of activities.

2182
02:35:06,859 --> 02:35:09,530
Was importing immigrants one of them?

2183
02:35:09,530 --> 02:35:13,029
"I'll tell you another thing," said Kamenev.

2184
02:35:13,029 --> 02:35:18,290
"I phoned several times but just got an answering
machine each time.

2185
02:35:18,290 --> 02:35:25,979
When someone finally answered they just hung
up without saying a word when I asked to speak

2186
02:35:25,979 --> 02:35:27,600
to Mossolov."

2187
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:30,061
"Good work, Victor.

2188
02:35:30,061 --> 02:35:31,830
Do you have an address?"

2189
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:33,620
I asked.

2190
02:35:33,620 --> 02:35:37,890
The business was located on Brighton Beach
Avenue.

2191
02:35:37,890 --> 02:35:40,380
It would be worth checking out.

2192
02:35:40,380 --> 02:35:45,170
A guy like Zernov wouldn't act on his own
initiative.

2193
02:35:45,170 --> 02:35:47,979
He wasn't paid to think.

2194
02:35:47,979 --> 02:35:54,979
He would obey the boss's orders, and that
boss could be the mysterious Mossolov.

2195
02:35:54,979 --> 02:36:02,350
I passed on the information to Captain Oldenberg
and also informed him about my meeting with

2196
02:36:02,350 --> 02:36:03,850
Lockhart.

2197
02:36:03,850 --> 02:36:08,720
More leads for the NYPD to follow up.

2198
02:36:08,720 --> 02:36:16,100
Oldenberg promised to put an NYPD surveillance
unit in place to watch the office.

2199
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:21,800
At the Romanov house, I described the Russian
fishing boat and its probable function to

2200
02:36:21,800 --> 02:36:24,160
Mrs. Romanov.

2201
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:29,520
She listened carefully, obviously upset by
what she heard.

2202
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:35,090
She turned away and held a handkerchief to
her eyes for a moment.

2203
02:36:35,090 --> 02:36:41,100
Then she turned back to me and told me what
progress she had made.

2204
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:48,120
Mrs. Romanov had already made contact with
one of the people on the list, Boris Tchernov,

2205
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:53,229
a young man her husband had helped personally.

2206
02:36:53,229 --> 02:36:58,359
She had made an appointment with Tchernov,
who would come to her house.

2207
02:36:58,359 --> 02:37:01,479
Tchernov was in his late twenties.

2208
02:37:01,479 --> 02:37:07,300
He was an immigrant who had been in the U.S.A.
for almost twelve months.

2209
02:37:07,300 --> 02:37:14,350
His English was good enough to communicate
effectively without the need for an interpreter.

2210
02:37:14,350 --> 02:37:21,229
He had met Alexei Romanov and was sincerely
grateful for all the assistance he had received

2211
02:37:21,229 --> 02:37:23,689
from the Immigrant Welfare Society.

2212
02:37:23,689 --> 02:37:29,290
"Mr. Tchernov, does the name 'Mossolov' mean
anything to you?"

2213
02:37:29,290 --> 02:37:30,290
I asked.

2214
02:37:30,290 --> 02:37:32,840
He shook his head.

2215
02:37:32,840 --> 02:37:34,850
"I've never heard of it."

2216
02:37:34,850 --> 02:37:36,979
"What about 'Nick'?

2217
02:37:36,979 --> 02:37:38,931
'Nick Zernov'?"

2218
02:37:38,931 --> 02:37:40,640
I asked.

2219
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:44,560
I could see an anxious expression as I said
the name.

2220
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:47,830
Tchernov knew all about him.

2221
02:37:47,830 --> 02:37:51,859
"I can tell you all about Zernov.

2222
02:37:51,859 --> 02:37:57,939
Three years ago, I was living in Minsk, back
in the old country.

2223
02:37:57,939 --> 02:38:00,220
It was a hard life.

2224
02:38:00,220 --> 02:38:06,880
There were ten of us living in a little apartment
in one of the old Soviet buildings on the

2225
02:38:06,880 --> 02:38:09,560
outskirts of the city.

2226
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:14,260
I'd always dreamed of a new life in the U.S.A.

2227
02:38:14,260 --> 02:38:18,090
But it was difficult to emigrate legally.

2228
02:38:18,090 --> 02:38:22,140
There's a limited number of visas available.

2229
02:38:22,140 --> 02:38:28,310
I heard some gossip around that there were
other means of entering the country.

2230
02:38:28,310 --> 02:38:32,271
What you needed was three thousand U.S. dollars.

2231
02:38:32,271 --> 02:38:40,479
A man called Nick visited regularly, made
all the arrangements, and promised that jobs

2232
02:38:40,479 --> 02:38:43,350
would be waiting for us."

2233
02:38:43,350 --> 02:38:51,729
Tchernov continued with more details of the
operation: "Provided you had the money, no

2234
02:38:51,729 --> 02:38:52,729
questions were asked.

2235
02:38:52,729 --> 02:38:55,479
I finally met him.

2236
02:38:55,479 --> 02:39:01,710
Exactly as I had imagined - well-dressed,
successful.

2237
02:39:01,710 --> 02:39:09,510
He told me stories about the U.S.A., the land
of opportunity where any man could realize

2238
02:39:09,510 --> 02:39:14,270
his ambition - as long as you had the dollars.

2239
02:39:14,270 --> 02:39:23,420
I worked every hour I could, I borrowed, and,
I'm ashamed to say, I stole.

2240
02:39:23,420 --> 02:39:27,420
I didn't care how I got that cash."

2241
02:39:27,420 --> 02:39:31,850
"There was no question of flying us in.

2242
02:39:31,850 --> 02:39:40,000
We were taken to the Baltic Coast, near St.
Petersburg, to an isolated fishing port.

2243
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:44,020
I couldn't believe the boat they put us in.

2244
02:39:44,020 --> 02:39:52,740
The conditions were awful - disgusting food,
cold damp cabins, even rats.

2245
02:39:52,740 --> 02:39:58,160
There must have been twenty of us on board.

2246
02:39:58,160 --> 02:40:03,100
Crossing the Atlantic, one of the guys became
seriously sick.

2247
02:40:03,100 --> 02:40:06,100
He had terrible stomach pains.

2248
02:40:06,100 --> 02:40:13,450
We begged the captain to radio for help, but
he refused.

2249
02:40:13,450 --> 02:40:16,170
The guy died after four days.

2250
02:40:16,170 --> 02:40:23,890
They wrapped him up in an old sheet, tied
a lump of concrete to his feet, and dropped

2251
02:40:23,890 --> 02:40:26,170
him overboard.

2252
02:40:26,170 --> 02:40:31,680
I don't imagine his family ever got a refund
from Nick."

2253
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:36,140
"The Atlantic crossing took about ten days.

2254
02:40:36,140 --> 02:40:43,470
Most of the time it was stormy, we were exhausted
and seasick.

2255
02:40:43,470 --> 02:40:49,351
Finally we were all put into a small lifeboat
in the middle of the night and dropped off

2256
02:40:49,351 --> 02:40:51,700
on a deserted beach.

2257
02:40:51,700 --> 02:40:55,680
Nick was waiting there with a truck.

2258
02:40:55,680 --> 02:41:03,310
We were ordered to get in and lie on the floor
and were taken to an empty factory building.

2259
02:41:03,310 --> 02:41:10,600
I remember there was some sort of railroad
track on the floor.

2260
02:41:10,600 --> 02:41:18,109
We waited there and eventually we were taken
in small groups to various addresses in the

2261
02:41:18,109 --> 02:41:22,510
Brighton Beach and Coney Island area."

2262
02:41:22,510 --> 02:41:30,500
"Once we'd arrived, we learned the true reality
of our situation.

2263
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:38,460
We were in the U.S.A. without entry visas
and had none of the standard documentation.

2264
02:41:38,460 --> 02:41:45,840
In effect, we were non-persons and totally
in Nick's power.

2265
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:52,670
If I was discovered by the authorities, I
could be sent straight back to Belarus.

2266
02:41:52,670 --> 02:41:56,690
He could exploit us any way he liked.

2267
02:41:56,690 --> 02:42:04,399
We were given really miserable jobs in kitchens
or workshops, working twelve hours a day or

2268
02:42:04,399 --> 02:42:10,890
more for very little money - and me with a
good education.

2269
02:42:10,890 --> 02:42:14,040
My life was being dominated by him.

2270
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:19,319
I escaped but found myself living on the streets."

2271
02:42:19,319 --> 02:42:23,899
"I was confused and didn't know how I would
cope.

2272
02:42:23,899 --> 02:42:28,620
Then, I contacted the Immigrant Welfare Society.

2273
02:42:28,620 --> 02:42:35,779
Mr. Romanov was very kind to me and gave me
money for food and rent.

2274
02:42:35,779 --> 02:42:38,120
Such a good man.

2275
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:47,290
He was helping me with my application for
a Green Card so I could become a legal resident.

2276
02:42:47,290 --> 02:42:52,250
I was so shocked when I heard that he'd been
murdered.

2277
02:42:52,250 --> 02:42:55,141
Who could have done such a thing?"

2278
02:42:55,141 --> 02:42:59,770
Tchernov had come to the end of his story.

2279
02:42:59,770 --> 02:43:04,840
I took out Zernov's photograph which we had
received from Oldenberg.

2280
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:08,319
"This picture was taken some time ago.

2281
02:43:08,319 --> 02:43:11,510
Does this guy look anything like Nick?"

2282
02:43:11,510 --> 02:43:13,479
I asked.

2283
02:43:13,479 --> 02:43:17,630
Boris examined the picture closely and handed
it back.

2284
02:43:17,630 --> 02:43:27,060
"He's put on weight and lost some hair, but
that's him."

2285
02:43:27,060 --> 02:43:33,279
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
A message from Mossolov

2286
02:43:33,279 --> 02:43:39,270
It was almost six o'clock by the time we got
back to East 43rd Street.

2287
02:43:39,270 --> 02:43:43,140
The light on the answering machine was flashing.

2288
02:43:43,140 --> 02:43:45,479
Stella pressed the playback button.

2289
02:43:45,479 --> 02:43:49,689
A brief but threatening anonymous message:

2290
02:43:49,689 --> 02:43:58,200
"If you know what's good for your health,
keep out of our business."

2291
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:04,350
Someone was trying to warn us off and was
prepared to use violence.

2292
02:44:04,350 --> 02:44:08,640
But I wasn't intending to lose any sleep over
it.

2293
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:14,120
We had done enough for one day and I told
Stella to go home.

2294
02:44:14,120 --> 02:44:20,420
I stayed on at the office for a while, sorting
through some old case papers and filing them

2295
02:44:20,420 --> 02:44:22,140
away.

2296
02:44:22,140 --> 02:44:23,990
The phone rang.

2297
02:44:23,990 --> 02:44:28,240
I grabbed it and said: "Marley speaking."

2298
02:44:28,240 --> 02:44:31,600
But there was just silence.

2299
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:38,149
Exactly the same thing happened twice again,
at fifteen-minute intervals.

2300
02:44:38,149 --> 02:44:40,390
Whoever was at the other end wasn't talkative.

2301
02:44:40,390 --> 02:44:45,350
I was starting to get suspicious.

2302
02:44:45,350 --> 02:44:49,180
We have one of those phones that displays
the caller's number.

2303
02:44:49,180 --> 02:44:54,910
I tried calling the number, but there was
no answer.

2304
02:44:54,910 --> 02:45:00,021
Maybe someone was keeping track of where I
was.

2305
02:45:00,021 --> 02:45:05,920
I put a call through to the Coast Guard to
see if Lockhart had anything to report from

2306
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:08,950
their patrols off southern Long Island.

2307
02:45:08,950 --> 02:45:11,930
Nothing as yet.

2308
02:45:11,930 --> 02:45:18,270
It had been a long day, and the ideal way
to finish it off was an appointment with a

2309
02:45:18,270 --> 02:45:22,189
cold beer at McFadden's Bar.

2310
02:45:22,189 --> 02:45:28,080
Outside, East 43rd Street was practically
deserted.

2311
02:45:28,080 --> 02:45:34,350
Was it my imagination or was there someone
watching me in the shadows of a service entrance

2312
02:45:34,350 --> 02:45:36,770
across the street?

2313
02:45:36,770 --> 02:45:39,840
I went over to investigate.

2314
02:45:39,840 --> 02:45:41,109
Nobody there.

2315
02:45:41,109 --> 02:45:48,770
Either my eyes were playing tricks on me or
I was turning into a nervous wreck.

2316
02:45:48,770 --> 02:45:51,489
Definitely time for that beer.

2317
02:45:51,489 --> 02:45:58,370
I would feel more comfortable where there
was noise, bright lights and company.

2318
02:45:58,370 --> 02:46:04,670
I ordered a large beer and stayed by the bar
for a while, chatting with some of the regular

2319
02:46:04,670 --> 02:46:07,810
guys from the Daily News.

2320
02:46:07,810 --> 02:46:11,330
The tiredness was beginning to hit me.

2321
02:46:11,330 --> 02:46:13,810
Time to go home.

2322
02:46:13,810 --> 02:46:15,680
But I'd forgotten something.

2323
02:46:15,680 --> 02:46:24,050
I patted my pockets and realized I'd left
the keys to my apartment in the office.

2324
02:46:24,050 --> 02:46:30,890
Returning along East 43rd Street, I suddenly
became aware of a large black limo following

2325
02:46:30,890 --> 02:46:33,620
me very slowly.

2326
02:46:33,620 --> 02:46:39,529
I turned around and started walking rapidly
in the other direction.

2327
02:46:39,529 --> 02:46:48,021
As I was passing the car, it stopped and a
door suddenly swung open, blocking my path.

2328
02:46:48,021 --> 02:46:56,040
I stepped aside to avoid the door, but a large,
heavily built guy was already out of the car,

2329
02:46:56,040 --> 02:46:58,980
standing directly in front of me.

2330
02:46:58,980 --> 02:47:06,740
I immediately recognized the bushy eyebrows
and broken nose: Nick Zernov.

2331
02:47:06,740 --> 02:47:10,979
He was easily six inches taller than me.

2332
02:47:10,979 --> 02:47:14,060
The street was completely deserted.

2333
02:47:14,060 --> 02:47:22,180
If I tried to run, I knew Zernov, being younger
and in better shape, would easily catch me.

2334
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:25,930
The only sensible thing to do was to talk.

2335
02:47:25,930 --> 02:47:28,350
"Good evening.

2336
02:47:28,350 --> 02:47:29,800
Lost your way or something?"

2337
02:47:29,800 --> 02:47:32,030
I asked.

2338
02:47:32,030 --> 02:47:36,160
Zernov's response was to lift me up effortlessly
by my coat.

2339
02:47:36,160 --> 02:47:40,850
His forehead was now level with my nose.

2340
02:47:40,850 --> 02:47:45,630
That's what I call a serious invasion of personal
space.

2341
02:47:45,630 --> 02:47:50,340
I didn't like the idea of my nose being broken
either.

2342
02:47:50,340 --> 02:47:56,890
"Marley, I have a message from Mossolov,"
said Zernov.

2343
02:47:56,890 --> 02:48:00,189
"Stop asking questions.

2344
02:48:00,189 --> 02:48:04,609
Don't stick your big nose in our business!

2345
02:48:04,609 --> 02:48:10,000
Mossolov knows you've been watching us and
wants you to call your people off.

2346
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:14,649
Otherwise, I'll have to break your legs.

2347
02:48:14,649 --> 02:48:16,899
Is that clear, Marley?"

2348
02:48:16,899 --> 02:48:20,090
"Couldn't be clearer," I replied.

2349
02:48:20,090 --> 02:48:22,430
"Message received and understood."

2350
02:48:22,430 --> 02:48:30,140
Zernov got back inside the car which sped
off towards Park Avenue.

2351
02:48:30,140 --> 02:48:32,439
I'd learned two things from the meeting.

2352
02:48:32,439 --> 02:48:37,870
First, that Zernov was definitely working
for Mossolov.

2353
02:48:37,870 --> 02:48:42,160
Second, Mossolov thought I had been watching
them.

2354
02:48:42,160 --> 02:48:47,439
They hadn't connected the surveillance operation
with the NYPD.

2355
02:48:47,439 --> 02:48:50,120
This was a possible advantage.

2356
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:55,439
If they didn't think that the police were
involved, they might still go ahead with another

2357
02:48:55,439 --> 02:48:57,690
immigrant smuggling operation.

2358
02:48:57,690 --> 02:49:05,840
I'd have to contact Oldenberg to tell him
to make the police operation less obvious.

2359
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:09,750
Then they'd assume they'd scared me off.

2360
02:49:09,750 --> 02:49:13,700
I went back to the office and called Captain
Oldenberg.

2361
02:49:13,700 --> 02:49:17,760
Fortunately he was still at his desk.

2362
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:20,090
I explained what had just happened.

2363
02:49:20,090 --> 02:49:23,430
"Do you have anything new on Zernov?"

2364
02:49:23,430 --> 02:49:24,510
I asked.

2365
02:49:24,510 --> 02:49:28,670
"We have some good photos," Oldenberg said.

2366
02:49:28,670 --> 02:49:36,480
"Zernov was twice seen entering the Mossolov
Import Export office on Brighton Beach Avenue.

2367
02:49:36,480 --> 02:49:40,350
But we haven't had a sighting of the boss
of the organization.

2368
02:49:40,350 --> 02:49:46,550
Zernov's been seen with two men and a woman
on a couple of occasions.

2369
02:49:46,550 --> 02:49:50,370
I'll email some pictures through to you."

2370
02:49:50,370 --> 02:49:53,380
One more call before I could go home.

2371
02:49:53,380 --> 02:49:55,840
This time to Joe Blaney.

2372
02:49:55,840 --> 02:50:00,250
"Joe, I've had a serious threat made against
me.

2373
02:50:00,250 --> 02:50:02,590
I need protection.

2374
02:50:02,590 --> 02:50:04,330
You'll need to be armed.

2375
02:50:04,330 --> 02:50:08,810
And another thing, will you rent a car?

2376
02:50:08,810 --> 02:50:12,090
Anything that's powerful but looks anonymous.

2377
02:50:12,090 --> 02:50:13,790
Could you start this evening?"

2378
02:50:13,790 --> 02:50:15,590
"Sure, boss.

2379
02:50:15,590 --> 02:50:19,040
I'm not doing anything else at the moment,"
Joe replied.

2380
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:21,310
"OK, then.

2381
02:50:21,310 --> 02:50:26,649
Pack a suitcase and come to my apartment at
9:00 PM," I said.

2382
02:50:26,649 --> 02:50:35,810
On the subway home, I immediately fell fast
asleep but knew, as always, I'd wake up just

2383
02:50:35,810 --> 02:50:40,300
before the train arrived at Main Street, Queens.

2384
02:50:40,300 --> 02:50:45,189
It's a technique I've developed over long
years of commuting.

2385
02:50:45,189 --> 02:50:51,440
On Main Street, I bought a bottle of chilled
white wine at the local liquor store and got

2386
02:50:51,440 --> 02:50:54,960
myself a Korean take-out meal.

2387
02:50:54,960 --> 02:51:01,521
It was my intention finally to have the quiet
evening I'd promised myself.

2388
02:51:01,521 --> 02:51:06,430
When Joe arrived I knew I would sleep more
soundly.

2389
02:51:06,430 --> 02:51:13,250
It's reassuring to have an ex-NYPD heavyweight
boxing champion sharing the apartment.

2390
02:51:13,250 --> 02:51:18,689
Since I left the NYPD, I've never carried
a gun.

2391
02:51:18,689 --> 02:51:26,280
Normally, my philosophy is that if a job involves
using a gun, it's a job not worth taking.

2392
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:30,880
That's on account of the potential health
risks.

2393
02:51:30,880 --> 02:51:38,561
I knew if Joe had to use a gun, he'd be more
accurate than I could ever hope to be.

2394
02:51:38,561 --> 02:51:41,430
There would be no weekend break.

2395
02:51:41,430 --> 02:51:48,210
I wanted to bring this case to a close.

2396
02:51:48,210 --> 02:51:53,390
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Memories

2397
02:51:53,390 --> 02:52:00,141
Saturday morning, the weather forecast promised
clear, mild weather over the weekend.

2398
02:52:00,141 --> 02:52:05,770
Perfect conditions for landing immigrants
along the Long Island shore?

2399
02:52:05,770 --> 02:52:11,960
Joe and I got an early start and had arrived
at East 43rd Street by 8:00 AM.

2400
02:52:11,960 --> 02:52:18,920
The light on the answering machine was flashing,
a message from Mrs. Romanov asking me to call

2401
02:52:18,920 --> 02:52:20,420
her urgently.

2402
02:52:20,420 --> 02:52:23,130
"Mrs. Romanov?

2403
02:52:23,130 --> 02:52:24,130
Marley here."

2404
02:52:24,130 --> 02:52:27,130
"I'm so glad you've called.

2405
02:52:27,130 --> 02:52:31,910
I've had some dreadful news." said Mrs. Romanov.

2406
02:52:31,910 --> 02:52:38,350
"You remember the bartender at the Odessa
Steps who witnessed Zernov leaving with De

2407
02:52:38,350 --> 02:52:40,340
La Cruz?

2408
02:52:40,340 --> 02:52:42,680
He's been badly beaten up.

2409
02:52:42,680 --> 02:52:45,569
And not only him.

2410
02:52:45,569 --> 02:52:49,351
The manager of the bar was also attacked."

2411
02:52:49,351 --> 02:52:52,820
"I'm terribly sorry to hear that.

2412
02:52:52,820 --> 02:52:55,680
This is probably Zernov's work.

2413
02:52:55,680 --> 02:52:59,630
He's making sure they stay silent," I said.

2414
02:52:59,630 --> 02:53:02,689
"Well, he's succeeded.

2415
02:53:02,689 --> 02:53:05,760
They're absolutely terrified.

2416
02:53:05,760 --> 02:53:11,570
I heard about this through contacts at the
Immigrant Welfare Society.

2417
02:53:11,570 --> 02:53:14,590
It was a brutal attack.

2418
02:53:14,590 --> 02:53:18,890
That man Zernov must not get away with it."

2419
02:53:18,890 --> 02:53:24,230
I was just thinking about contacting Oldenberg
and Lockhart when the phone rang.

2420
02:53:24,230 --> 02:53:28,779
It was Stella, calling from Metropolitan Hospital.

2421
02:53:28,779 --> 02:53:32,229
"Nat, thank God I've caught you.

2422
02:53:32,229 --> 02:53:34,210
I've been trying your apartment.

2423
02:53:34,210 --> 02:53:35,439
It's Jose.

2424
02:53:35,439 --> 02:53:40,729
His memory's returning, and he wants to speak
to you.

2425
02:53:40,729 --> 02:53:43,440
Can you get over to the hospital now?"

2426
02:53:43,440 --> 02:53:47,520
"I'm on my way," I replied.

2427
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:49,880
Jose was looking much brighter.

2428
02:53:49,880 --> 02:53:55,090
His head was heavily bandaged, but he was
sitting up in bed.

2429
02:53:55,090 --> 02:54:01,560
"Nat, it's all coming back," said Jose, "what
happened on that night out.

2430
02:54:01,560 --> 02:54:06,710
I can remember things now - places, people,
faces."

2431
02:54:06,710 --> 02:54:12,310
Piece by piece, Jose put the story together.

2432
02:54:12,310 --> 02:54:17,279
Everything matched what I already knew until
he reached the point where he'd made a grab

2433
02:54:17,279 --> 02:54:19,420
for the baseball bat.

2434
02:54:19,420 --> 02:54:25,200
"OK, now Jose, take it slowly from this point,"
I said.

2435
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:29,000
"Tell me everything you saw or heard."

2436
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:34,189
"I looked up and saw this crowd standing over
me.

2437
02:54:34,189 --> 02:54:35,270
Wow!

2438
02:54:35,270 --> 02:54:38,260
They were mad as hell at me.

2439
02:54:38,260 --> 02:54:41,630
I couldn't understand what I'd done.

2440
02:54:41,630 --> 02:54:45,430
Then I realized it was something to do with
the bat.

2441
02:54:45,430 --> 02:54:50,340
I heard someone shouting 'What the hell are
you doing?'

2442
02:54:50,340 --> 02:54:55,630
I was lying there, scared, surrounded by a
bunch of real angry guys.

2443
02:54:55,630 --> 02:55:00,870
Then someone pushed through the crowd and
said: 'Don't touch him.

2444
02:55:00,870 --> 02:55:01,870
He's mine.

2445
02:55:01,870 --> 02:55:03,450
I'll take care of him'."

2446
02:55:03,450 --> 02:55:05,700
"What did he look like?"

2447
02:55:05,700 --> 02:55:06,700
I asked.

2448
02:55:06,700 --> 02:55:11,880
"A big, tough guy, as tall as Joe here," said
Jose.

2449
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:14,980
"He was wearing a shiny suit.

2450
02:55:14,980 --> 02:55:16,120
Expensive-looking.

2451
02:55:16,120 --> 02:55:18,680
He didn't look pretty.

2452
02:55:18,680 --> 02:55:22,180
He had a face like a boxer who's lost too
many fights."

2453
02:55:22,180 --> 02:55:26,430
"Sounds exactly like our friend Zernov.

2454
02:55:26,430 --> 02:55:28,380
Go on, Jose."

2455
02:55:28,380 --> 02:55:30,520
"He picked me up off the floor.

2456
02:55:30,520 --> 02:55:34,189
This guy's name, you said it was Zernov?

2457
02:55:34,189 --> 02:55:39,430
Well he was holding my arm behind my back
with a tight grip.

2458
02:55:39,430 --> 02:55:44,240
Then he spoke again to the crowd, and repeated:
'I'll take care of him.

2459
02:55:44,240 --> 02:55:45,240
Got any objections?"'

2460
02:55:45,240 --> 02:55:48,040
"Then he bought you a drink?"

2461
02:55:48,040 --> 02:55:49,280
I asked.

2462
02:55:49,280 --> 02:55:50,370
"Yeah.

2463
02:55:50,370 --> 02:55:53,330
He gave me drink after drink.

2464
02:55:53,330 --> 02:55:58,529
I felt like I was going to be sick but I was
too scared to refuse.

2465
02:55:58,529 --> 02:56:01,690
He started asking me all these questions.

2466
02:56:01,690 --> 02:56:07,880
He wanted to know where I was from and what
I was doing in Brighton Beach.

2467
02:56:07,880 --> 02:56:12,470
Then he said he'd give me a lift home and
took me outside.

2468
02:56:12,470 --> 02:56:16,750
I tried to escape, but he was too quick for
me.

2469
02:56:16,750 --> 02:56:21,600
My arm was pushed up so far behind my back
that I thought it'd break.

2470
02:56:21,600 --> 02:56:28,380
He took me down a side street, pushed me up
against a wall, and said, 'You're coming with

2471
02:56:28,380 --> 02:56:29,700
me.'

2472
02:56:29,700 --> 02:56:32,920
He grabbed me by the neck until I couldn't
breathe.

2473
02:56:32,920 --> 02:56:38,160
And that's the point, Nat, where everything
goes blank.

2474
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:41,630
The next thing I knew I was here in a hospital
bed."

2475
02:56:41,630 --> 02:56:42,819
"Thanks, Jose.

2476
02:56:42,819 --> 02:56:47,180
You'll need to make a full statement to the
police.

2477
02:56:47,180 --> 02:56:50,250
Do you feel well enough to do that?"

2478
02:56:50,250 --> 02:56:52,859
"No problem," replied Jose.

2479
02:56:52,859 --> 02:56:55,490
"But I want to get out of here.

2480
02:56:55,490 --> 02:56:57,270
It's been nearly two weeks."

2481
02:56:57,270 --> 02:57:01,000
"It's not going to be long now," I said.

2482
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:06,970
"But you have to stay here under police guard,
so Zernov and company think they've gotten

2483
02:57:06,970 --> 02:57:09,069
away with it.

2484
02:57:09,069 --> 02:57:10,760
Just hang on.

2485
02:57:10,760 --> 02:57:14,330
The police are going to spread some misinformation.

2486
02:57:14,330 --> 02:57:19,979
So whatever you hear on the news, or read
in the papers, ignore it.

2487
02:57:19,979 --> 02:57:25,300
It'll just encourage Zernov and Mossolov to
remain under the impression that the police

2488
02:57:25,300 --> 02:57:28,670
think you're guilty."

2489
02:57:28,670 --> 02:57:33,279
Back at East 43rd Street, there was a message
from Captain Oldenberg.

2490
02:57:33,279 --> 02:57:40,550
A joint meeting between the NYPD and the Coast
Guard had been arranged for two o'clock at

2491
02:57:40,550 --> 02:57:43,380
police headquarters.

2492
02:57:43,380 --> 02:57:45,439
Oldenberg had invited me to attend.

2493
02:57:45,439 --> 02:57:48,029
I put a call through to him.

2494
02:57:48,029 --> 02:57:50,680
"What do you want, Marley?"

2495
02:57:50,680 --> 02:57:52,040
growled the captain.

2496
02:57:52,040 --> 02:57:57,010
"You sound full of the joys of spring, Oldenberg,"
I said.

2497
02:57:57,010 --> 02:57:59,670
"Couple of things you could do for me.

2498
02:57:59,670 --> 02:58:06,820
First, send an officer to Metropolitan Hospital
to take a full statement from De La Cruz.

2499
02:58:06,820 --> 02:58:14,610
His memory's returning, and it includes a
positive I.D. of a guy matching Zernov's description."

2500
02:58:14,610 --> 02:58:17,670
"Sure," said Oldenberg.

2501
02:58:17,670 --> 02:58:19,300
"Anything else?"

2502
02:58:19,300 --> 02:58:25,061
"I'd like you to spread a rumor, in advance
of this afternoon's meeting.

2503
02:58:25,061 --> 02:58:30,410
Could you arrange to issue a statement to
the press to the effect that De La Cruz will

2504
02:58:30,410 --> 02:58:37,490
be released from the hospital today and taken
to Rikers Island prison before his trial for

2505
02:58:37,490 --> 02:58:40,250
the murder of Romanov.

2506
02:58:40,250 --> 02:58:46,819
I want this distributed to all the local radio
and TV stations, and I also want it in the

2507
02:58:46,819 --> 02:58:49,120
Sunday newspapers.

2508
02:58:49,120 --> 02:58:55,590
My theory is, the more misinformation you
create, the more likely Mossolov is to make

2509
02:58:55,590 --> 02:58:56,700
a move."

2510
02:58:56,700 --> 02:58:59,340
"You got it, Marley.

2511
02:58:59,340 --> 02:59:02,979
I'll have the press office get on to it immediately.

2512
02:59:02,979 --> 02:59:06,279
And those pictures of Zernov that I promised
you.

2513
02:59:06,279 --> 02:59:09,479
I'll email them now."

2514
02:59:09,479 --> 02:59:11,750
Oldenberg was true to his word.

2515
02:59:11,750 --> 02:59:15,239
Within minutes the photos arrived.

2516
02:59:15,239 --> 02:59:21,510
The picture quality wasn't great but there
was enough detail there to make out Zernov,

2517
02:59:21,510 --> 02:59:24,109
looking huge and ugly, as normal.

2518
02:59:24,109 --> 02:59:26,029
"What do you think of these?"

2519
02:59:26,029 --> 02:59:27,729
I asked Joe.

2520
02:59:27,729 --> 02:59:33,210
"Well, he's been getting around a lot lately
and meeting a lot of people."

2521
02:59:33,210 --> 02:59:39,729
He pointed to one of the pictures showing
Zernov opening the limo door for a big man

2522
02:59:39,729 --> 02:59:42,989
in an expensive suit and dark glasses.

2523
02:59:42,989 --> 02:59:45,700
"Is that Mossolov do you think?"

2524
02:59:45,700 --> 02:59:49,020
"Could be," I answered.

2525
02:59:49,020 --> 02:59:55,090
In the next photo, the same man was standing
next to a woman with long dark hair.

2526
02:59:55,090 --> 02:59:57,970
"And who's the woman?

2527
02:59:57,970 --> 02:59:59,010
Another colleague?

2528
02:59:59,010 --> 03:00:00,609
Mossolov's wife?"

2529
03:00:00,609 --> 03:00:02,390
I said.

2530
03:00:02,390 --> 03:00:04,500
I looked out the window.

2531
03:00:04,500 --> 03:00:09,840
As promised on the early weather forecast,
it was clear and calm.

2532
03:00:09,840 --> 03:00:15,609
These conditions would be exactly what Mossolov
needed to bring in the next boatload.

2533
03:00:15,609 --> 03:00:22,400
A call came through from Lockhart to confirm
that he would be present at the afternoon

2534
03:00:22,400 --> 03:00:23,400
meeting.

2535
03:00:23,400 --> 03:00:29,120
He also brought me up-to-date on the latest
developments from the Coast Guard end.

2536
03:00:29,120 --> 03:00:33,890
"One of the captured crew members decided
to talk.

2537
03:00:33,890 --> 03:00:38,250
I'll email a copy of the statement in advance
of the meeting.

2538
03:00:38,250 --> 03:00:40,820
It makes for interesting reading.

2539
03:00:40,820 --> 03:00:45,689
There's strong evidence that the casualties
on Jones Beach and the wreck of the fishing

2540
03:00:45,689 --> 03:00:48,960
boat are connected."

2541
03:00:48,960 --> 03:00:55,400
As soon as the email was printed out, I glanced
quickly through it until I came to the relevant

2542
03:00:55,400 --> 03:00:56,520
section.

2543
03:00:56,520 --> 03:01:00,080
Then I read slowly and carefully.

2544
03:01:00,080 --> 03:01:03,530
We were carrying ten Russian immigrants.

2545
03:01:03,530 --> 03:01:10,979
The captain stopped about a kilometer off
shore, and the men were loaded onto the lifeboat.

2546
03:01:10,979 --> 03:01:15,890
We had complained to the captain about the
condition of the lifeboat.

2547
03:01:15,890 --> 03:01:19,189
The captain ignored the complaints.

2548
03:01:19,189 --> 03:01:22,569
A signal was received from the shore.

2549
03:01:22,569 --> 03:01:25,680
Then the lifeboat set off towards the light.

2550
03:01:25,680 --> 03:01:32,090
When it had covered about half the distance,
the weather changed rapidly.

2551
03:01:32,090 --> 03:01:34,390
A storm blew up.

2552
03:01:34,390 --> 03:01:37,649
We could see that the boat was in trouble.

2553
03:01:37,649 --> 03:01:40,140
They couldn't seem to control it.

2554
03:01:40,140 --> 03:01:43,600
I guess the motor had broken down.

2555
03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:45,939
Then we lost sight of it.

2556
03:01:45,939 --> 03:01:52,290
I begged the captain to move in and pick up
any survivors.

2557
03:01:52,290 --> 03:01:59,250
Eventually he agreed, but by the time we reached
the area, there was nothing to be seen.

2558
03:01:59,250 --> 03:02:05,960
We were now in danger of being driven onto
the shore ourselves, so we had to leave and

2559
03:02:05,960 --> 03:02:08,270
head out to sea.

2560
03:02:08,270 --> 03:02:12,069
It was then that we started to have engine
trouble.

2561
03:02:12,069 --> 03:02:17,529
The captain tried to steer away from the Long
Island shore, but the engine was gradually

2562
03:02:17,529 --> 03:02:19,931
losing power.

2563
03:02:19,931 --> 03:02:25,460
Day after day, we tried to fix the engine,
but nothing worked.

2564
03:02:25,460 --> 03:02:32,729
Eventually, a combination of wind and currents
started to push the ship back towards the

2565
03:02:32,729 --> 03:02:34,040
coast.

2566
03:02:34,040 --> 03:02:39,710
When the next storm blew up, the motor finally
failed completely.

2567
03:02:39,710 --> 03:02:41,210
We were helpless.

2568
03:02:41,210 --> 03:02:45,160
Also, we didn't have a life-boat to escape
in.

2569
03:02:45,160 --> 03:02:52,340
Our boat was finally wrecked on Jones Beach,
and the crew members were arrested by the

2570
03:02:52,340 --> 03:02:54,510
Coast Guard.

2571
03:02:54,510 --> 03:02:57,779
I continued reading through to the end.

2572
03:02:57,779 --> 03:03:03,899
No mention of any names of the people who
could be behind the operation.

2573
03:03:03,899 --> 03:03:10,720
If there was no connection here to Zernov
and Mossolov, maybe they would still go ahead

2574
03:03:10,720 --> 03:03:17,870
with an attempt to land illegal immigrants.

2575
03:03:17,870 --> 03:03:23,350
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Closing the net

2576
03:03:23,350 --> 03:03:29,220
As Joe drove me downtown on Second Avenue
to police headquarters, I turned on the car

2577
03:03:29,220 --> 03:03:35,540
radio and checked the local radio stations
to see if I could find any news.

2578
03:03:35,540 --> 03:03:39,939
I caught a bulletin on WNYC.

2579
03:03:39,939 --> 03:03:44,930
Oldenberg's press office had achieved everything
I could have hoped for.

2580
03:03:44,930 --> 03:03:51,810
Jose was named as having been arrested and
charged with the murder of Alexei Romanov.

2581
03:03:51,810 --> 03:03:53,180
Perfect.

2582
03:03:53,180 --> 03:03:58,780
The publicity would, hopefully, deceive Zernov
and Mossolov.

2583
03:03:58,780 --> 03:04:03,979
As long as they were acting under a false
sense of security, they might proceed with

2584
03:04:03,979 --> 03:04:07,250
bringing in the next shipment of immigrants.

2585
03:04:07,250 --> 03:04:14,330
At police headquarters, Oldenberg and Lockhart
were reviewing the case.

2586
03:04:14,330 --> 03:04:21,489
After a while, I spoke up: "Let's assume that
Romanov was murdered on Mossolov's orders

2587
03:04:21,489 --> 03:04:25,580
because he knew too much about their operation.

2588
03:04:25,580 --> 03:04:32,370
At least some of the dates we found on Romanov's
computer are the same dates when the smuggling

2589
03:04:32,370 --> 03:04:34,520
operations took place.

2590
03:04:34,520 --> 03:04:37,819
We have a future date on that list.

2591
03:04:37,819 --> 03:04:44,130
Now assuming the shipment will be landed on
Fire Island, then it should be a simple surveillance

2592
03:04:44,130 --> 03:04:49,319
operation to follow any vehicle to its destination.

2593
03:04:49,319 --> 03:04:51,319
That's where we should strike.

2594
03:04:51,319 --> 03:04:57,640
I doubt whether Mossolov is going to run the
risk of hanging around exposed beaches."

2595
03:04:57,640 --> 03:05:02,630
"All seems logical enough to me," said Lockhart.

2596
03:05:02,630 --> 03:05:10,670
"Now we already know that Mossolov Import
and Export is located on Brighton Beach Avenue.

2597
03:05:10,670 --> 03:05:13,989
I don't believe the immigrants will be taken
there.

2598
03:05:13,989 --> 03:05:16,040
It'd be too obvious.

2599
03:05:16,040 --> 03:05:21,229
I know from Boris Tchernov's statements that
the immigrants were taken to some sort of

2600
03:05:21,229 --> 03:05:25,050
factory building in the Coney Island area.

2601
03:05:25,050 --> 03:05:31,310
I would suggest that any vehicle they use
to move the people is followed at a very safe

2602
03:05:31,310 --> 03:05:36,550
distance, maybe by NYPD helicopter.

2603
03:05:36,550 --> 03:05:43,560
Then have police units standing by in the
Coney Island and Brighton Beach area."

2604
03:05:43,560 --> 03:05:51,160
Oldenberg and Lockhart then proceeded to organize
the combined NYPD/Coast Guard operation.

2605
03:05:51,160 --> 03:05:57,970
The plan was to have a Coast Guard patrol
boat out at sea observing any movements there.

2606
03:05:57,970 --> 03:06:05,510
Also, a Coast Guard helicopter from Air Station
Cape Cod would be on patrol and Coast Guard

2607
03:06:05,510 --> 03:06:10,930
officers would be posted along Fire Island
at regular intervals.

2608
03:06:10,930 --> 03:06:16,630
The police part of the operation was to observe
all road exit points from the beaches to the

2609
03:06:16,630 --> 03:06:24,750
mainland and report to the NYPD helicopter,
which would then follow the suspicious vehicle.

2610
03:06:24,750 --> 03:06:31,660
Four unmarked NYPD cars would be placed along
the length of Neptune Avenue, ready to pursue

2611
03:06:31,660 --> 03:06:34,439
the vehicle to its final destination.

2612
03:06:34,439 --> 03:06:38,470
I had a special request to make.

2613
03:06:38,470 --> 03:06:44,390
"Oldenberg, I'm not in the habit of asking
favors from you, but I want to be in on this

2614
03:06:44,390 --> 03:06:48,120
operation with my colleague Joe Blaney.

2615
03:06:48,120 --> 03:06:55,410
You realize that I've provided the NYPD with
most of the information in this case so far?"

2616
03:06:55,410 --> 03:06:58,149
"Yes," replied Oldenberg.

2617
03:06:58,149 --> 03:07:02,279
"And you know my personal interest in this
case.

2618
03:07:02,279 --> 03:07:08,070
I want to prove, without any doubt, that De
La Cruz is innocent.

2619
03:07:08,070 --> 03:07:12,930
And also, I want to find out who killed Romanov.

2620
03:07:12,930 --> 03:07:15,410
I need a confession.

2621
03:07:15,410 --> 03:07:18,700
That's why we have to be there at the finish."

2622
03:07:18,700 --> 03:07:26,540
"You're both ex-NYPD, so you're well aware
of the risks," said Oldenberg bluntly.

2623
03:07:26,540 --> 03:07:33,150
"You have my permission, but don't even think
about playing the hero, Marley.

2624
03:07:33,150 --> 03:07:34,150
Understood?

2625
03:07:34,150 --> 03:07:40,320
We'll have all units in position by dusk,
and I'll keep in regular contact with you

2626
03:07:40,320 --> 03:07:43,060
by cell phone."

2627
03:07:43,060 --> 03:07:47,279
Joe and I had little else to do until nightfall.

2628
03:07:47,279 --> 03:07:53,470
Before leaving for Coney Island, I put a call
through to Stella to give her an update.

2629
03:07:53,470 --> 03:07:56,229
"Nat, those news bulletins!"

2630
03:07:56,229 --> 03:07:57,330
exclaimed Stella.

2631
03:07:57,330 --> 03:07:58,850
"They're just awful!

2632
03:07:58,850 --> 03:08:02,370
What a relief they're not true!

2633
03:08:02,370 --> 03:08:08,229
I've had calls from just about every relative
in the family about the news.

2634
03:08:08,229 --> 03:08:10,260
I just had to tell them not to worry."

2635
03:08:10,260 --> 03:08:16,580
"Well, if those bulletins have fooled all
your family, let's hope they have the same

2636
03:08:16,580 --> 03:08:21,840
effect on Zernov and Mossolov," I remarked.

2637
03:08:21,840 --> 03:08:28,330
Another call to Mrs. Romanov to inform her
of the real purpose of the bulletins and to

2638
03:08:28,330 --> 03:08:31,680
reassure her that we were making definite
progress.

2639
03:08:31,680 --> 03:08:38,580
"I'm reasonably optimistic that your husband's
killer will be behind bars by tomorrow," I

2640
03:08:38,580 --> 03:08:39,580
said.

2641
03:08:39,580 --> 03:08:46,100
"Take care, Mr. Marley and God be with you,"
she replied.

2642
03:08:46,100 --> 03:08:50,660
We headed off in the rental car towards the
Brooklyn Bridge.

2643
03:08:50,660 --> 03:08:56,570
Through the steel network I could see that
the waters of the East River were smooth and

2644
03:08:56,570 --> 03:09:01,689
calm, with the late afternoon sunshine reflecting
off the surface.

2645
03:09:01,689 --> 03:09:07,689
We passed rapidly through the suburbs of Brooklyn
on Ocean Parkway, which eventually brought

2646
03:09:07,689 --> 03:09:12,830
us onto Surf Avenue, parallel to the oceanfront.

2647
03:09:12,830 --> 03:09:19,130
We had some time to kill, so I asked Joe to
continue west along Surf Avenue.

2648
03:09:19,130 --> 03:09:27,029
The amusement parks, dominated by the huge
roller coaster rides soon came into view.

2649
03:09:27,029 --> 03:09:32,409
One of those rides which had terrified and
delighted me as a child was still operating

2650
03:09:32,409 --> 03:09:34,990
- the Cyclone.

2651
03:09:34,990 --> 03:09:40,439
I still remember the way the train of little
cars would climb up the track to the highest

2652
03:09:40,439 --> 03:09:48,569
point, then dive and shake down what felt
like a series of near-vertical drops.

2653
03:09:48,569 --> 03:09:53,500
There was another roller coaster ride standing
behind locked gates.

2654
03:09:53,500 --> 03:09:57,330
I examined the curves and slopes.

2655
03:09:57,330 --> 03:10:03,489
Now I recognized it as the old Thunderbolt,
another childhood favorite.

2656
03:10:03,489 --> 03:10:12,720
Sadly, it was now in a state of total disrepair
with peeling paintwork, rust, and fire damage.

2657
03:10:12,720 --> 03:10:19,430
The sun was now sinking low and the western
sky was glowing with shades of orange and

2658
03:10:19,430 --> 03:10:20,430
pink.

2659
03:10:20,430 --> 03:10:23,830
It was going to be a long night.

2660
03:10:23,830 --> 03:10:29,370
It was completely dark when I received the
first call from Oldenberg.

2661
03:10:29,370 --> 03:10:36,310
The Coast Guard had been following the movements
of ships off the Long Island coast all day.

2662
03:10:36,310 --> 03:10:42,240
As the light faded, a fishing boat had turned
towards the shore and was now heading in the

2663
03:10:42,240 --> 03:10:44,710
direction of Fire Island.

2664
03:10:44,710 --> 03:10:49,180
"It looks like it's all happening, Joe," I
said.

2665
03:10:49,180 --> 03:10:55,180
"Time to get in position."

2666
03:10:55,180 --> 03:11:01,140
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Face to face

2667
03:11:01,140 --> 03:11:09,060
Time seemed to drag as Joe and I sat waiting
in the car, in a parking lot off Neptune Avenue.

2668
03:11:09,060 --> 03:11:14,590
Joe had brought a police radio with him so
we could listen in on the action.

2669
03:11:14,590 --> 03:11:19,530
I didn't want to feel we were missing any
of the excitement.

2670
03:11:19,530 --> 03:11:26,479
Soon after ten o'clock, we received a report
of the first definite sighting from Oldenberg.

2671
03:11:26,479 --> 03:11:33,220
Coast Guard observers had watched a small
boat land a party of ten men and four packages

2672
03:11:33,220 --> 03:11:36,090
at the eastern end of Fire Island.

2673
03:11:36,090 --> 03:11:43,529
A white Ford truck had arrived, driven by
a tall, heavily built guy who matched Zernov's

2674
03:11:43,529 --> 03:11:45,510
description.

2675
03:11:45,510 --> 03:11:52,570
The truck had picked up the men and the packages
and had been spotted leaving Fire Island.

2676
03:11:52,570 --> 03:11:59,979
Later, Oldenberg informed us that the truck
was now on Long Island Highway 27, heading

2677
03:11:59,979 --> 03:12:01,840
toward Freeport.

2678
03:12:01,840 --> 03:12:07,140
The NYPD helicopter was following its movements
at a safe distance.

2679
03:12:07,140 --> 03:12:13,340
It was around eleven o'clock when we heard
that the truck was approaching the Coney Island

2680
03:12:13,340 --> 03:12:14,390
area.

2681
03:12:14,390 --> 03:12:18,320
The helicopter pilot was having trouble following
the vehicle.

2682
03:12:18,320 --> 03:12:24,319
An ocean storm was brewing, and a lot of fog
was rolling in.

2683
03:12:24,319 --> 03:12:28,810
Not ideal conditions for surveillance from
the air.

2684
03:12:28,810 --> 03:12:34,840
The pilot now reported that the truck was
on the eastern side of JFK airport, on the

2685
03:12:34,840 --> 03:12:40,460
Belt Parkway, which circles the coast around
Jamaica Bay.

2686
03:12:40,460 --> 03:12:46,710
Frequent banks of fog continued to make observation
from the air a problem.

2687
03:12:46,710 --> 03:12:49,770
Then we heard a panicky note in the pilot's
voice.

2688
03:12:49,770 --> 03:12:52,939
"Captain Oldenberg, we're losing him...

2689
03:12:52,939 --> 03:12:56,120
No, there he is again..."

2690
03:12:56,120 --> 03:12:58,170
This is getting difficult.

2691
03:12:58,170 --> 03:12:59,880
There's more fog ahead.

2692
03:12:59,880 --> 03:13:01,270
Lost him.

2693
03:13:01,270 --> 03:13:03,750
No, we've got him again.

2694
03:13:03,750 --> 03:13:08,420
Captain, we may not be able to keep the suspect
under surveillance.

2695
03:13:08,420 --> 03:13:12,000
The truck's heading east on the Belt Parkway
now.

2696
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:19,290
I suggest you move all units now to the Belt
Parkway exits for Coney Island."

2697
03:13:19,290 --> 03:13:22,220
Finally we heard the pilot admit defeat.

2698
03:13:22,220 --> 03:13:26,199
"Captain Oldenberg, we've lost him."

2699
03:13:26,199 --> 03:13:29,279
There was radio silence for a time.

2700
03:13:29,279 --> 03:13:35,189
Then a sighting of the truck leaving the Belt
Parkway at exit seven and heading towards

2701
03:13:35,189 --> 03:13:37,670
Ocean Parkway.

2702
03:13:37,670 --> 03:13:44,590
A call from Oldenberg: "Marley, the truck's
in Coney Island, on Ocean Parkway.

2703
03:13:44,590 --> 03:13:50,110
I have one unit already following, and I'm
ordering all units in.

2704
03:13:50,110 --> 03:13:52,239
I'll keep you posted."

2705
03:13:52,239 --> 03:13:55,960
We continued listening in on the police radio.

2706
03:13:55,960 --> 03:14:02,229
At first everything went smoothly until the
intersection at Brighton Beach Parkway.

2707
03:14:02,229 --> 03:14:08,620
An officer was speaking to Oldenberg: "Captain,
we have the suspect in sight.

2708
03:14:08,620 --> 03:14:11,490
We're about fifty yards behind.

2709
03:14:11,490 --> 03:14:14,030
Red light, coming to a stop.

2710
03:14:14,030 --> 03:14:15,030
Hey!

2711
03:14:15,030 --> 03:14:17,689
He's run right through the red light."

2712
03:14:17,689 --> 03:14:21,649
"Try and follow," ordered Oldenberg.

2713
03:14:21,649 --> 03:14:28,609
Suddenly, over the radio, we heard the scream
of tires followed by two impacts of steel

2714
03:14:28,609 --> 03:14:30,880
against steel.

2715
03:14:30,880 --> 03:14:32,060
Then silence.

2716
03:14:32,060 --> 03:14:36,410
"Captain Oldenberg," said the officer.

2717
03:14:36,410 --> 03:14:44,420
"We just ran into the side of a cab, and our
other car is buried in the back of our car.

2718
03:14:44,420 --> 03:14:47,279
Nobody hurt, just shaken up.

2719
03:14:47,279 --> 03:14:50,100
Sorry, but both cars are out of action."

2720
03:14:50,100 --> 03:14:53,021
"Where's the third car?"

2721
03:14:53,021 --> 03:14:54,480
shouted Oldenberg.

2722
03:14:54,480 --> 03:14:57,120
"Get after the suspect!"

2723
03:14:57,120 --> 03:14:59,370
"Sorry Captain.

2724
03:14:59,370 --> 03:15:03,040
The traffic's now at a standstill at the intersection.

2725
03:15:03,040 --> 03:15:04,430
Nothing's moving.

2726
03:15:04,430 --> 03:15:06,520
The third car can't get through.

2727
03:15:06,520 --> 03:15:08,810
We've lost him."

2728
03:15:08,810 --> 03:15:09,810
"Hell!"

2729
03:15:09,810 --> 03:15:11,100
swore Oldenberg.

2730
03:15:11,100 --> 03:15:15,790
A moment later, Oldenberg called me on the
cell phone.

2731
03:15:15,790 --> 03:15:16,790
"Marley.

2732
03:15:16,790 --> 03:15:18,540
I hate to admit this..."

2733
03:15:18,540 --> 03:15:23,140
"But you've lost the suspect," I finished
for him.

2734
03:15:23,140 --> 03:15:25,370
"We know, Oldenberg.

2735
03:15:25,370 --> 03:15:28,600
We've been listening in on the police radio.

2736
03:15:28,600 --> 03:15:34,160
Joe and I are going to cruise around the neighborhood,
just in case we spot something.

2737
03:15:34,160 --> 03:15:37,790
I suggest you do the same."

2738
03:15:37,790 --> 03:15:41,150
I asked Joe to head towards Surf Avenue.

2739
03:15:41,150 --> 03:15:47,400
Soon we were passing by the amusement parks,
with the ghostly shapes of the big wheels

2740
03:15:47,400 --> 03:15:51,790
and roller coasters appearing out of the fog.

2741
03:15:51,790 --> 03:15:57,140
As we made our way along the avenue, I started
thinking about the surveillance photographs

2742
03:15:57,140 --> 03:15:58,859
of Zernov.

2743
03:15:58,859 --> 03:16:06,470
Suddenly, every piece in the puzzle joined
together to give me a complete picture.

2744
03:16:06,470 --> 03:16:10,439
That photograph of Zernov outside a set of
gates.

2745
03:16:10,439 --> 03:16:15,699
I thought back to our tour of the sights of
Coney Island.

2746
03:16:15,699 --> 03:16:18,609
The old Thunderbolt roller coaster.

2747
03:16:18,609 --> 03:16:21,710
The gates with the peeling paint.

2748
03:16:21,710 --> 03:16:27,080
Boris Tchernov's statement that they were
taken to some sort of factory building with

2749
03:16:27,080 --> 03:16:30,190
a railroad track on the floor.

2750
03:16:30,190 --> 03:16:33,699
I knew then where they had to be.

2751
03:16:33,699 --> 03:16:37,359
"Joe, the old Thunderbolt roller coaster.

2752
03:16:37,359 --> 03:16:39,770
And step on it."

2753
03:16:39,770 --> 03:16:45,239
The car sped towards West 16th Street, off
Surf Avenue.

2754
03:16:45,239 --> 03:16:51,020
As we approached the roller coaster, the ruined
structure gradually came into focus through

2755
03:16:51,020 --> 03:16:52,100
the fog.

2756
03:16:52,100 --> 03:16:57,939
I told Joe to kill the headlights as we neared
the gates.

2757
03:16:57,939 --> 03:17:03,109
All was quiet and the street was deserted.

2758
03:17:03,109 --> 03:17:09,760
Signs reading 'Dangerous structure - No admittance'
were attached to the fence surrounding the

2759
03:17:09,760 --> 03:17:11,830
old ride.

2760
03:17:11,830 --> 03:17:17,880
The gates were at least ten feet high but
with Joe's help I climbed over.

2761
03:17:17,880 --> 03:17:24,479
On the other side, there was a lock and key
with a thick steel chain.

2762
03:17:24,479 --> 03:17:26,300
I tried the key in the lock.

2763
03:17:26,300 --> 03:17:29,739
It turned without any effort.

2764
03:17:29,739 --> 03:17:33,060
This entrance was obviously used regularly.

2765
03:17:33,060 --> 03:17:37,430
I opened the gates to let Joe through.

2766
03:17:37,430 --> 03:17:39,200
We looked around us.

2767
03:17:39,200 --> 03:17:45,120
Now, there was sufficient moonlight to provide
better visibility.

2768
03:17:45,120 --> 03:17:52,300
About seventy-five yards away, I spotted a
white Ford truck and a limo parked alongside

2769
03:17:52,300 --> 03:17:58,160
a one-story building in the shadows of the
roller coaster structure.

2770
03:17:58,160 --> 03:18:00,390
No lights could be seen.

2771
03:18:00,390 --> 03:18:03,040
A door opened.

2772
03:18:03,040 --> 03:18:08,750
A sudden flash of light from the interior
of the building, then darkness.

2773
03:18:08,750 --> 03:18:11,340
"Get down!"

2774
03:18:11,340 --> 03:18:13,800
I whispered to Joe.

2775
03:18:13,800 --> 03:18:18,199
We dived for cover behind an ancient roller
coaster car.

2776
03:18:18,199 --> 03:18:21,470
I looked over the edge and watched.

2777
03:18:21,470 --> 03:18:24,199
It was Zernov.

2778
03:18:24,199 --> 03:18:31,180
He started to walk in the direction of the
gates, shining a flashlight from side to side.

2779
03:18:31,180 --> 03:18:36,870
We kept our heads low as the ray of light
was directed towards us.

2780
03:18:36,870 --> 03:18:38,859
Then he went back inside.

2781
03:18:38,859 --> 03:18:44,790
My mouth was dry and my heart was beating
like a drum.

2782
03:18:44,790 --> 03:18:47,939
"Joe, we need back-up.

2783
03:18:47,939 --> 03:18:51,210
Zernov's in there, and presumably Mossolov.

2784
03:18:51,210 --> 03:18:55,420
There could be more of the gang inside."

2785
03:18:55,420 --> 03:18:58,730
I called Oldenberg and gave him our location.

2786
03:18:58,730 --> 03:19:06,529
"When you arrive, I want you to park so your
car's blocking the gate, OK?

2787
03:19:06,529 --> 03:19:09,180
Same for the other police car.

2788
03:19:09,180 --> 03:19:12,090
Then we'll have the exit sealed.

2789
03:19:12,090 --> 03:19:14,660
But hurry!"

2790
03:19:14,660 --> 03:19:16,489
Oldenberg made rapid time.

2791
03:19:16,489 --> 03:19:21,660
Two minutes later we heard the deep hum of
the engine.

2792
03:19:21,660 --> 03:19:24,739
Oldenberg and his sergeant slipped inside
the gates.

2793
03:19:24,739 --> 03:19:28,500
"Over here," I whispered to Oldenberg.

2794
03:19:28,500 --> 03:19:31,149
"Where's the other car?"

2795
03:19:31,149 --> 03:19:33,319
I demanded.

2796
03:19:33,319 --> 03:19:36,280
Oldenberg spoke urgently into his cell phone.

2797
03:19:36,280 --> 03:19:41,470
His officers had gone to the wrong roller
coaster.

2798
03:19:41,470 --> 03:19:47,620
Oldenberg considered the situation for a moment,
then announced: "We're going in.

2799
03:19:47,620 --> 03:19:49,989
All the evidence should be there.

2800
03:19:49,989 --> 03:19:54,700
Any delay could mean we lose the key players.

2801
03:19:54,700 --> 03:19:56,620
You with me, Marley?"

2802
03:19:56,620 --> 03:19:59,740
"All the way, Oldenberg."

2803
03:19:59,740 --> 03:20:02,700
We hurried over to the door of the building.

2804
03:20:02,700 --> 03:20:08,330
From inside, we could hear conversation in
Russian, and laughter.

2805
03:20:08,330 --> 03:20:13,970
Although there were only the four of us, we
had the element of surprise.

2806
03:20:13,970 --> 03:20:20,180
Oldenberg, the sergeant, and Joe had their
weapons ready.

2807
03:20:20,180 --> 03:20:24,450
Oldenberg nodded to his sergeant, who kicked
the door wide open.

2808
03:20:24,450 --> 03:20:26,910
We rushed inside.

2809
03:20:26,910 --> 03:20:28,180
The sergeant shouted: "Police!

2810
03:20:28,180 --> 03:20:29,180
Don't move!

2811
03:20:29,180 --> 03:20:32,510
Hands in the air!"

2812
03:20:32,510 --> 03:20:37,870
For a second, the scene before us seemed to
be frozen in time.

2813
03:20:37,870 --> 03:20:41,029
The building was lit by oil lamps.

2814
03:20:41,029 --> 03:20:47,590
Ten young men were sitting on benches around
a table, drinking coffee and eating sandwiches.

2815
03:20:47,590 --> 03:20:54,330
Zernov, who was sitting at another table,
stared at us in disbelief.

2816
03:20:54,330 --> 03:20:59,529
The big man from the photographs was there
sitting next to Zernov.

2817
03:20:59,529 --> 03:21:03,890
The woman with long dark hair was standing
behind them.

2818
03:21:03,890 --> 03:21:08,229
On the floor was the railroad track which
Tchernov had mentioned.

2819
03:21:08,229 --> 03:21:13,859
In a corner lay an old roller coaster car,
on its side.

2820
03:21:13,859 --> 03:21:17,840
The place must have been the repair workshop.

2821
03:21:17,840 --> 03:21:22,090
The woman didn't seem to be alarmed at all.

2822
03:21:22,090 --> 03:21:27,850
Zernov looked towards her, with a confused
expression, as if expecting instructions.

2823
03:21:27,850 --> 03:21:33,729
Then she turned towards Zernov and screamed:
"Don't just stand there.

2824
03:21:33,729 --> 03:21:35,069
Do something!"

2825
03:21:35,069 --> 03:21:41,880
He suddenly got up and reached for his gun,
but before he could aim it, two shots rang

2826
03:21:41,880 --> 03:21:42,880
out.

2827
03:21:42,880 --> 03:21:47,280
He spun around with the impact of the bullets.

2828
03:21:47,280 --> 03:21:52,600
Then he crashed to the floor, firing his gun
wildly.

2829
03:21:52,600 --> 03:21:57,609
A bullet passed through one of the oil lamps,
smashing the glass.

2830
03:21:57,609 --> 03:22:02,140
A cloud of gunsmoke hung in the air.

2831
03:22:02,140 --> 03:22:05,771
The place now seemed unnaturally quiet.

2832
03:22:05,771 --> 03:22:09,569
For a second everyone stood motionless.

2833
03:22:09,569 --> 03:22:12,170
Then we rushed forward.

2834
03:22:12,170 --> 03:22:15,470
There were two bullet holes in Zernov's chest.

2835
03:22:15,470 --> 03:22:21,180
Blood was dripping from his mouth and he was
gasping for breath.

2836
03:22:21,180 --> 03:22:24,900
He didn't look as if he had long to live.

2837
03:22:24,900 --> 03:22:31,650
Meanwhile, the woman had thrown herself to
the ground and had landed in a pool of rust-colored,

2838
03:22:31,650 --> 03:22:34,210
oily water.

2839
03:22:34,210 --> 03:22:39,610
As she raised herself, her face and hair and
were dripping with the orange-black liquid.

2840
03:22:39,610 --> 03:22:44,310
I looked at the guy still sitting at the table.

2841
03:22:44,310 --> 03:22:46,890
"Are you Mossolov?"

2842
03:22:46,890 --> 03:22:51,319
He stared at me, almost paralyzed with fear.

2843
03:22:51,319 --> 03:22:55,090
"I'm just the driver," he stammered.

2844
03:22:55,090 --> 03:22:57,280
"Don't shoot me."

2845
03:22:57,280 --> 03:23:01,069
The woman was now wiping the oil from her
face.

2846
03:23:01,069 --> 03:23:06,060
She looked down at her feet, not making eye
contact with anybody.

2847
03:23:06,060 --> 03:23:10,610
Then, a slight movement from Zernov.

2848
03:23:10,610 --> 03:23:17,859
With a painful effort, he slowly pointed a
bloody finger towards the woman.

2849
03:23:17,859 --> 03:23:20,200
Then the gasping stopped.

2850
03:23:20,200 --> 03:23:25,700
His eyes open wide in a lifeless stare.

2851
03:23:25,700 --> 03:23:28,859
We looked at the woman in astonishment.

2852
03:23:28,859 --> 03:23:31,520
Was she Mossolov?

2853
03:23:31,520 --> 03:23:36,210
She remained standing there, looking down
at the floor.

2854
03:23:36,210 --> 03:23:39,260
The woman's handbag was lying on the table.

2855
03:23:39,260 --> 03:23:46,620
I quickly found a driver's license: Katarina
Mossolov.

2856
03:23:46,620 --> 03:23:49,480
I showed the document to Oldenberg.

2857
03:23:49,480 --> 03:23:54,649
"Let me introduce you to Mossolov," I said.

2858
03:23:54,649 --> 03:23:57,630
"Well, would you believe it!"

2859
03:23:57,630 --> 03:24:00,000
exclaimed Oldenberg.

2860
03:24:00,000 --> 03:24:04,190
Everybody's attention was focused on Mossolov.

2861
03:24:04,190 --> 03:24:08,020
But suddenly there was the sound of rapid
footsteps.

2862
03:24:08,020 --> 03:24:12,210
"Hey, where's the driver?" asked the sergeant
urgently.

2863
03:24:12,210 --> 03:24:16,660
From outside, we heard the sound of a motor.

2864
03:24:16,660 --> 03:24:21,910
Then tires spinning and screaming as the limo
raced to the gates.

2865
03:24:21,910 --> 03:24:26,660
"He won't get far," remarked Oldenberg.

2866
03:24:26,660 --> 03:24:31,949
Then came the crash of breaking wood and bending
metal.

2867
03:24:31,949 --> 03:24:34,340
Footsteps running down the street.

2868
03:24:34,340 --> 03:24:36,560
A shout: "Police!

2869
03:24:36,560 --> 03:24:38,790
Stop right there!"

2870
03:24:38,790 --> 03:24:41,170
The other police car had finally arrived.

2871
03:24:41,170 --> 03:24:44,420
"They've got him," said Oldenberg.

2872
03:24:44,420 --> 03:24:51,220
"From the sound of the crash, that's another
NYPD car out of action.

2873
03:24:51,220 --> 03:24:56,320
Still, cars are replaceable, good officers
aren't."

2874
03:24:56,320 --> 03:24:59,540
I had one last favor to ask Oldenberg.

2875
03:24:59,540 --> 03:25:04,170
"Before you charge Mossolov, I want a word
with her.

2876
03:25:04,170 --> 03:25:06,689
Just trust me, OK?"

2877
03:25:06,689 --> 03:25:08,170
She looked at me blankly.

2878
03:25:08,170 --> 03:25:11,760
Oily liquid was still dripping from her hair.

2879
03:25:11,760 --> 03:25:17,160
"I don't enjoy being threatened," I said to
her coldly.

2880
03:25:17,160 --> 03:25:24,670
"The last time I met your man Zernov, he promised
to break my legs if I didn't behave.

2881
03:25:24,670 --> 03:25:27,050
Now look at him.

2882
03:25:27,050 --> 03:25:34,140
The NYPD already has enough evidence against
you to put you away for a very long time.

2883
03:25:34,140 --> 03:25:39,180
The only choice you have is to cooperate.

2884
03:25:39,180 --> 03:25:43,920
Unless you'd like my muscle man Joe to help
persuade you."

2885
03:25:43,920 --> 03:25:46,960
I must have sounded convincing.

2886
03:25:46,960 --> 03:25:51,529
I knew it was an empty threat, but she believed
me.

2887
03:25:51,529 --> 03:25:54,200
She looked around in alarm.

2888
03:25:54,200 --> 03:25:57,930
Joe grinned unpleasantly at her to back up
the message.

2889
03:25:57,930 --> 03:25:59,870
"So tell me.

2890
03:25:59,870 --> 03:26:02,859
Did you have Romanov murdered?"

2891
03:26:02,859 --> 03:26:03,859
I asked.

2892
03:26:03,859 --> 03:26:04,900
"All right.

2893
03:26:04,900 --> 03:26:07,489
I admit it.

2894
03:26:07,489 --> 03:26:12,500
I ordered Romanov's death," she said in a
low, tired voice.

2895
03:26:12,500 --> 03:26:19,340
"He knew too much and had been asking too
many questions about my operation.

2896
03:26:19,340 --> 03:26:22,170
Nick was carrying out my orders.

2897
03:26:22,170 --> 03:26:24,780
But the fool made everything too complicated.

2898
03:26:24,780 --> 03:26:30,609
I told him to make it look like a simple car-jacking.

2899
03:26:30,609 --> 03:26:32,540
Nothing fancy.

2900
03:26:32,540 --> 03:26:37,500
Then he found that stupid drunk in the Odessa
Steps.

2901
03:26:37,500 --> 03:26:41,260
I don't know who was more stupid, Nick or
the drunk.

2902
03:26:41,260 --> 03:26:45,300
Not that it matters any more."

2903
03:26:45,300 --> 03:26:48,200
I had the confession I wanted.

2904
03:26:48,200 --> 03:26:50,101
Case closed.

2905
03:26:50,101 --> 03:26:52,860
"Oldenberg, did you catch all that?"

2906
03:26:52,860 --> 03:26:53,860
I asked.

2907
03:26:53,860 --> 03:26:55,729
"Everything, Marley.

2908
03:26:55,729 --> 03:26:58,630
And I didn't hear you making any threats.

2909
03:26:58,630 --> 03:27:02,130
May I congratulate you."

2910
03:27:02,130 --> 03:27:06,100
That was a compliment indeed, coming from
the captain.

2911
03:27:06,100 --> 03:27:07,319
"Thanks.

2912
03:27:07,319 --> 03:27:09,460
She's all yours now.

2913
03:27:09,460 --> 03:27:13,580
Will you arrange the immediate release of
De La Cruz?

2914
03:27:13,580 --> 03:27:18,819
He'll need a statement to the effect that
he was wrongfully arrested and charged, and

2915
03:27:18,819 --> 03:27:23,310
of course an official apology from the NYPD.

2916
03:27:23,310 --> 03:27:28,070
His lawyer will also be asking for financial
compensation for wrongful arrest."

2917
03:27:28,070 --> 03:27:32,730
"You got it," replied Oldenberg.

2918
03:27:32,730 --> 03:27:36,180
My hands started to tremble violently.

2919
03:27:36,180 --> 03:27:40,479
I knew that old familiar reaction to shock.

2920
03:27:40,479 --> 03:27:45,010
I felt a wave of exhaustion going through
my body.

2921
03:27:45,010 --> 03:27:52,350
But there were still two more things I had
to do; first a call to Mrs. Romanov.

2922
03:27:52,350 --> 03:27:54,300
"Mrs. Romanov?

2923
03:27:54,300 --> 03:27:56,840
I know who murdered your husband.

2924
03:27:56,840 --> 03:28:06,130
Nick Zernov acting under the orders of a Katarina
Mossolov, the woman behind the immigrant smuggling.

2925
03:28:06,130 --> 03:28:09,530
Zernov is now dead and Mossolov is under arrest.

2926
03:28:09,530 --> 03:28:13,460
You'll get a full report on Monday."

2927
03:28:13,460 --> 03:28:17,399
"Thank God you're safe," said Mrs. Romanov.

2928
03:28:17,399 --> 03:28:21,100
"I can't thank you enough."

2929
03:28:21,100 --> 03:28:22,630
And a call to Stella.

2930
03:28:22,630 --> 03:28:24,660
"It's Nat.

2931
03:28:24,660 --> 03:28:26,520
We have all the proof.

2932
03:28:26,520 --> 03:28:29,580
Jose's going to be a free man.

2933
03:28:29,580 --> 03:28:31,600
We've cleared his name."

2934
03:28:31,600 --> 03:28:35,939
"Oh, Nat, I'm so relieved.

2935
03:28:35,939 --> 03:28:37,760
I don't know what to say.

2936
03:28:37,760 --> 03:28:42,170
It's like huge weight's been lifted from me.

2937
03:28:42,170 --> 03:28:45,660
I'll have to phone around to all the family
right now."

2938
03:28:45,660 --> 03:28:48,310
"You do that, Stella.

2939
03:28:48,310 --> 03:28:51,410
I'll see you on Monday."

2940
03:28:51,410 --> 03:28:55,270
I took one last look around the repair shop.

2941
03:28:55,270 --> 03:29:02,359
The glow of the oil lamps, Zernov lifeless
on the floor, dead eyes staring into empty

2942
03:29:02,359 --> 03:29:10,439
space, Mossolov now in handcuffs, with an
expression of complete disbelief.

2943
03:29:10,439 --> 03:29:16,340
The illegal immigrants were still sitting
at the table, looking around in shocked silence.

2944
03:29:16,340 --> 03:29:23,590
What an introduction to the U.S.A., the land
of opportunity!

2945
03:29:23,590 --> 03:29:30,149
Time to get back to some of that predictable,
routine work like divorce, bad debts, and

2946
03:29:30,149 --> 03:29:32,109
missing persons.

2947
03:29:32,109 --> 03:29:38,250
It was safe and dull, paid the bills, and
didn't involve being shot at.

2948
03:29:38,250 --> 03:29:40,820
"Come on, Joe.

2949
03:29:40,820 --> 03:29:44,199
That's quite enough excitement for one night.

2950
03:29:44,199 --> 03:29:45,199
Let's go home."

2951
03:29:45,199 --> 03:29:45,470
- THE END -
