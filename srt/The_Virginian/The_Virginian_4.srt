1
00:00:00,019 --> 00:00:06,720
At the gleams of new daylight which they
let in my thoughts went to the clump of

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:17,682
cottonwoods, and I lay still with hands
and feet growing steadily cold.

3
00:00:17,682 --> 00:00:29,003
Now it was going to happen.

4
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:39,782
I wondered how they would do it;
one instance had been described to me by

5
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:49,113
a witness, but that was done from a
bridge, and there had been

6
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:52,515
but a single victim.

7
00:00:52,515 --> 00:01:01,708
This morning, would one have to wait and
see the other go through with it first?

8
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:10,551
The smell of smoke reached me,
and next the rattle of tin dishes.

9
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:23,320
Breakfast was something I had forgotten,
and one of them was cooking it now in

10
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,132
the dry shelter of the stable.

11
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:38,690
He was alone, because the talking and the
steps were outside the stable,

12
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:46,144
and I could hear the sounds of horses
being driven into the corral and

13
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:48,384
saddled.

14
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:54,145
Then I perceived that the coffee was
ready, and almost immediately

15
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:57,465
the cook called them.

16
00:01:57,465 --> 00:02:07,425
One came in, shutting the door behind him
as he reentered, which the rest as they

17
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:14,259
followed imitated; for at each opening
of the door I saw the light of day leap

18
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:22,289
into the stable and heard the louder
sounds of the rain.

19
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:31,752
Then the sound and the light would again
be shut out, until someone at length

20
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:46,242
spoke out bluntly, bidding the door be
left open on account of the smoke.

21
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:50,644
What were they hiding from?

22
00:02:50,644 --> 00:02:52,434
he asked.

23
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:55,473
The runaways that had escaped?

24
00:02:55,473 --> 00:03:02,536
A laugh followed this sally,
and the door was left open.

25
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:11,136
Thus I learned that there had been more
thieves than the two that were captured.

26
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:21,808
It gave a little more ground for their
suspicion about me and my anxiety to

27
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:26,054
pass the night elsewhere.

28
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:30,837
It cost nothing to detain me,
and they were taking

29
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:35,287
no chances, however remote.

30
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:40,467
The fresh air and the light now filled
the stable, and I lay listening while

31
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:45,662
their breakfast brought
more talk from them.

32
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:52,626
They were more at ease now than was I,
who had nothing to do but carry out my

33
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:59,206
role of slumber in the stall;
they spoke in a friendly,

34
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:05,595
ordinary way, as if this were like every
other morning of the week to them.

35
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:13,498
They addressed the prisoners with a sort
of fraternal kindness,

36
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:22,196
not bringing them pointedly into the
conversation, nor yet

37
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:25,836
pointedly leaving them out.

38
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:33,518
I made out that they must all be sitting
round the breakfast together,

39
00:04:33,518 --> 00:04:41,279
those who had to die and those who
had to kill them.

40
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,151
The Virginian I never heard speak.

41
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:55,630
But I heard the voice of Steve;
he discussed with his captors the sundry

42
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,411
points of his capture.

43
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:01,868
“Do you remember a haystack?”

44
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,490
he asked.

45
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:10,678
“Away up the south fork of Gros Ventre?”

46
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:16,595
“That was Thursday afternoon,”
said one of the captors.

47
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:19,032
“There was a shower.”

48
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:20,016
“Yes.

49
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:21,456
It rained.

50
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:27,736
We had you fooled that time.

51
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:39,537
I was laying on the ledge above
to report your movements.”

52
00:05:39,537 --> 00:05:43,298
Several of them laughed.

53
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:49,596
“We thought you were over
on Spread Creek then.”

54
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:58,367
“I figured you thought so by the trail
you left after the stack.

55
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:10,978
Saturday we watched you turn your back on
us up Spread Creek.

56
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:17,610
We were snug among the trees the other
side of Snake River.

57
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,431
That was another time we had you fooled.”

58
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:28,296
They laughed again at their own expense.

59
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:40,489
I have heard men pick to pieces a hand of
whist with more antagonism.

60
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:47,952
Steve continued: “Would we head for Idaho?

61
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:58,991
Would we swing back over the Divide?

62
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:02,515
You didn’t know which!

63
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:09,798
And when we generalled you on to that
band of horses you thought was the band

64
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:17,815
you were hunting⁠—ah,
we were a strong combination!”

65
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:25,019
He broke off with the first touch of
bitterness I had felt in his words.

66
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,681
“Nothing is any stronger
than its weakest point.”

67
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:36,091
It was the Virginian who said this,
and it was the first word he had spoken.

68
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:39,022
“Naturally,” said Steve.

69
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:45,557
His tone in addressing the Virginian was
so different, so curt,

70
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:56,823
that I supposed he took the weakest
point to mean himself.

71
00:07:56,823 --> 00:08:04,380
But the others now showed me that I was
wrong in this explanation.

72
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,031
“That’s so,” one said.

73
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:14,642
“Its weakest point is where a rope or a
gang of men is going to break

74
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:18,413
when the strain comes.

75
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:23,243
And you was linked with
a poor partner, Steve.”

76
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:27,643
“You’re right I was,”
said the prisoner, back in

77
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:32,275
his easy, casual voice.

78
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:40,748
“You ought to have got yourself
separated from him, Steve.”

79
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:45,686
There was a pause.

80
00:08:45,686 --> 00:08:50,285
“Yes,” said the prisoner, moodily.

81
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:54,965
“I’m sitting here because
one of us blundered.”

82
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:59,115
He cursed the blunderer.

83
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:05,720
“Lighting his fool fire queered the
whole deal,” he added.

84
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:15,200
As he again heavily cursed the blunderer,
the others murmured to each other

85
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,012
various I told you so’s.

86
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:29,019
“You’d never have built that
fire, Steve,” said one.

87
00:09:34,297 --> 00:09:44,149
“I said that when we spied
the smoke,” said another.

88
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:50,309
“I said, ‘That’s none of Steve’s work,
lighting fires and revealing

89
00:09:50,309 --> -1:59:59,000
to us their whereabouts.’

90
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

91
00:09:56,359 --> 00:10:01,950
It struck me that they were
plying Steve with compliments.

92
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:13,603
“Pretty hard to have the fool get away
and you get caught,” a third suggested.

93
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:17,386
At this they seemed to wait.

94
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:23,585
I felt something curious in
all this last talk.

95
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:28,257
“Oh, did he get away?”

96
00:10:28,257 --> 00:10:32,310
said the prisoner, then.

97
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:43,041
Again they waited; and a
new voice spoke huskily:⁠—

98
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:49,091
“I built that fire, boys.”

99
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:53,091
It was the prisoner in
the gray flannel shirt.

100
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:58,191
“Too late, Ed,” they told him kindly.

101
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:02,614
“You ain’t a good liar.”

102
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:07,612
“What makes you laugh, Steve?”

103
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:11,898
said someone.

104
00:11:11,898 --> 00:11:18,483
“Oh, the things I notice.”

105
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:24,044
“Meaning Ed was pretty slow in
backing up your play?

106
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:27,683
The joke is really on you, Steve.

107
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:34,403
You’d ought never to have cursed the
fire-builder if you wanted us to

108
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,766
believe he was present.

109
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:48,685
But we’d not have done much to Shorty,
even if we had caught him.

110
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:58,501
All he wants is to be scared good and
hard, and he’ll go back into

111
00:11:58,501 --> 00:12:07,222
virtuousness, which is his nature when
not travelling with Trampas.”

112
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:12,133
Steve’s voice sounded hard now.

113
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:17,403
“You have caught Ed and me.

114
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:23,163
That should satisfy you for one gather.”

115
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:29,143
“Well, we think different, Steve.

116
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:37,618
Trampas escaping leaves
this thing unfinished.”

117
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:42,861
“So Trampas escaped too, did he?”

118
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:45,021
said the prisoner.

119
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:54,676
“Yes, Steve, Trampas escaped⁠—this time;
and Shorty with him⁠—this time.

120
00:12:54,676 --> 00:13:01,513
We know it most as well as if
we’d seen them go.

121
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:08,927
And we’re glad Shorty is loose,
for he’ll build another fire or

122
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:11,607
do some other foolishness

123
00:13:11,607 --> -1:59:59,000
next time

124
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
,

125
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:13,447
and

126
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:18,612
that’s the time we’ll get Trampas.”

127
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:27,353
Their talk drifted to other points,
and I lay thinking of the skirmish that

128
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:34,314
had played beneath the
surface of their banter.

129
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:41,577
Yes, the joke, as they put
it, was on Steve.

130
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:48,410
He had lost one point in the game to them.

131
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:55,250
They were playing for names.

132
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:06,566
He, being a chivalrous thief,
was playing to hide names.

133
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:19,085
They could only, among several likely
confederates, guess Trampas and Shorty.

134
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:25,826
So it had been a slip for him to curse
the man who built the fire.

135
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:29,349
At least, they so held it.

136
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:37,452
For, they with subtlety reasoned,
one curses the absent.

137
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:43,825
And I agreed with them that Ed did not
know how to lie well;

138
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:52,886
he should have at once claimed the
disgrace of having spoiled

139
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:56,427
the expedition.

140
00:14:56,427 --> 00:15:05,230
If Shorty was the blunderer,
then certainly Trampas was the other

141
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:17,925
man; for the two were as inseparable
as don and master.

142
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:26,258
Trampas had enticed Shorty away from
good, and trained him in evil.

143
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:34,460
It now struck me that after his single
remark the Virginian had been silent

144
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,980
throughout their shrewd discussion.

145
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:46,613
It was the other prisoner that I
heard them next address.

146
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:52,400
“You don’t eat any breakfast, Ed.”

147
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,576
“Brace up, Ed.

148
00:15:55,576 --> 00:16:00,399
Look at Steve, how hardy he eats!”

149
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:08,552
But Ed, it seemed, wanted no breakfast.

150
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:14,367
And the tin dishes rattled as they were
gathered and taken to be packed.

151
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:19,660
“Drink this coffee, anyway,”
another urged; “you’ll feel warmer.”

152
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,860
These words almost made it seem
like my own execution.

153
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,683
My whole body turned cold in company with
the prisoner’s, and as if with a clank

154
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:32,263
the situation tightened
throughout my senses.

155
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:35,100
“I reckon if everyone’s
ready we’ll start.”

156
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,885
It was the Virginian’s voice once more,
and different from the rest.

157
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:42,645
I heard them rise at his bidding,
and I put the blanket over my head.

158
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:46,470
I felt their tread as they walked
out, passing my stall.

159
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,950
The straw that was half under me and half
out in the stable was stirred as by

160
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,238
something heavy dragged or half
lifted along over it.

161
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:59,330
“Look out, you’re hurting Ed’s arm,”
one said to another,

162
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,810
as the steps with tangled
sounds passed slowly out.

163
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,730
I heard another among those who followed
say, “Poor Ed couldn’t

164
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,031
swallow his coffee.”

165
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:11,410
Outside they began getting on their
horses; and next their hoofs grew

166
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:16,594
distant, until all was silence round the
stable except the dull,

167
00:17:16,594 --> 00:17:20,474
even falling of the rain.

168
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,274
CHAPTER XXXI

169
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,564
The Cottonwoods

170
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,889
I do not know how long
I stayed there alone.

171
00:17:25,889 --> 00:17:29,614
It was the Virginian who came back,
and as he stood at the foot of my

172
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:35,633
blankets his eye, after meeting mine
full for a moment, turned aside.

173
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:40,391
I had never seen him look as he did now,
not even in Pitchstone Canyon when we

174
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:42,732
came upon the bodies of
Hank and his wife.

175
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:47,198
Until this moment we had found no chance
of speaking together,

176
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:51,555
except in the presence of others.

177
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:54,933
“Seems to be raining still,”
I began after a little.

178
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:55,648
“Yes.

179
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:56,942
It’s a wet spell.”

180
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:00,201
He stared out of the door,
smoothing his mustache.

181
00:18:00,201 --> 00:18:02,229
It was again I that spoke.

182
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:03,920
“What time is it?”

183
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,891
He brooded over his watch.

184
00:18:05,891 --> -1:59:59,000
“Twelve minutes to seven.

185
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

186
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:14,016
I rose and stood drawing on my clothes.

187
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:17,487
“The fire’s out,” said he;
and he assembled some new

188
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:19,138
sticks over the ashes.

189
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:21,261
Presently he looked round with a cup.

190
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:24,157
“Never mind that for me,” I said.

191
00:18:24,157 --> 00:18:27,007
“We’ve a long ride,” he suggested.

192
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,757
“I know.

193
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:30,811
I’ve crackers in my pocket.”

194
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:33,677
My boots being pulled on,
I walked to the door

195
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:35,080
and watched the clouds.

196
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,506
“They seem as if they might lift,” I said.

197
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:39,348
And I took out my watch.

198
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:41,090
“What time is it?”

199
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:41,720
he asked.

200
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,412
“A quarter of⁠—it’s run down.”

201
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:46,295
While I wound it he seemed to
be consulting his own.

202
00:18:46,295 --> 00:18:47,092
“Well?”

203
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,087
I inquired.

204
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:49,740
“Ten minutes past seven.”

205
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,540
As I was setting my watch he slowly said:

206
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,501
“Steve wound his all regular.

207
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,407
I had to night-guard him till two.”

208
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:59,321
His speech was like that of one in a
trance: so, at least,

209
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:01,441
it sounds in my memory today.

210
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:05,849
Again I looked at the weather and the
rainy immensity of the plain.

211
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:09,628
The foothills eastward where we were
going were a soft yellow.

212
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:15,094
Over the gray-green sagebrush moved
shapeless places of light⁠—not yet the

213
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:19,751
uncovered sunlight, but spots where the
storm was wearing thin;

214
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:23,686
and wandering streams of warmth passed
by slowly in the surrounding air.

215
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:29,210
As I watched the clouds and the earth,
my eyes chanced to fall on the

216
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,458
distant clump of cottonwoods.

217
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:35,841
Vapors from the enfeebled storm floated
round them, and they were indeed far

218
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,794
away; but I came inside and began
rolling up my blankets.

219
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:41,914
“You will not change your mind?”

220
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,992
said the Virginian by the fire.

221
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:46,270
“It is thirty-five miles.”

222
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:51,928
I shook my head, feeling a certain shame
that he should see how unnerved I was.

223
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:56,107
He swallowed a hot cupful,
and after it sat thinking;

224
00:19:56,107 --> 00:20:01,439
and presently he passed his hand across
his brow, shutting his eyes.

225
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:06,352
Again he poured out a cup,
and emptying this, rose abruptly to his

226
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:09,078
feet as if shaking himself
free from something.

227
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:12,035
“Let’s pack and quit here,” he said.

228
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:16,453
Our horses were in the corral and our
belongings in the shelter of what had

229
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:20,416
been once the cabin at
this forlorn place.

230
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,710
He collected them in silence while I
saddled my own animal,

231
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,635
and in silence we packed the two
packhorses, and threw the diamond hitch,

232
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:31,455
and hauled tight the slack, damp ropes.

233
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:35,415
Soon we had mounted, and as we turned
into the trail I gave a look back at

234
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:36,935
my last night’s lodging.

235
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,295
The Virginian noticed me.

236
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,095
“Goodbye forever!”

237
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:42,655
he interpreted.

238
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:44,175
“By God, I hope so!”

239
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:46,525
“Same here,” he confessed.

240
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:50,828
And these were our first
natural words this morning.

241
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:54,110
“This will go well,” said I,
holding my flask out to him;

242
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,017
and both of us took some,
and felt easier for it

243
00:20:58,017 --> 00:20:59,721
and the natural words.

244
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:04,453
For an hour we had been shirking real
talk, holding fast to the weather,

245
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:08,712
or anything, and all the while that
silent thing we were keeping off spoke

246
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:12,991
plainly in the air around us and in
every syllable that we uttered.

247
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:16,539
But now we were going to get away from
it; leave it behind in the stable,

248
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:19,341
and set ourselves free from it
by talking it out.

249
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:23,397
Already relief had begun to
stir in my spirits.

250
00:21:23,397 --> 00:21:26,175
“You never did this before,” I said.

251
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:26,774
“No.

252
00:21:26,774 --> 00:21:29,842
I never had it to do.”

253
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:33,374
He was riding beside me,
looking down at his saddle-horn.

254
00:21:33,374 --> 00:21:36,214
“I do not think I should ever
be able,” I pursued.

255
00:21:36,214 --> 00:21:38,414
Defiance sounded in his answer.

256
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:40,103
“I would do it again this morning.”

257
00:21:40,103 --> 00:21:41,944
“Oh, I don’t mean that.

258
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:43,229
It’s all right here.

259
00:21:43,229 --> -1:59:59,000
There’s no other way.

260
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

261
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,784
“I would do it all over again
the same this morning.

262
00:21:46,784 --> -1:59:59,000
Just the same.

263
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

264
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:52,392
“Why, so should I⁠—if I could
do it at all.”

265
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:56,239
I still thought he was justifying
their justice to me.

266
00:21:56,239 --> 00:22:00,263
He made no answer as he rode along,
looking all the while at his saddle.

267
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:05,217
But again he passed his hand over his
forehead with that frown and

268
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:07,137
shutting of the eyes.

269
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:11,537
“I should like to be sure I should behave
myself if I were condemned,” I said

270
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:12,082
next.

271
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:15,480
For it now came to me⁠—
which should I resemble?

272
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,132
Could I read the newspaper,
and be interested in county elections,

273
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:22,531
and discuss coming death as if I had
lost a game of cards?

274
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:25,132
Or would they have to drag me out?

275
00:22:25,132 --> 00:22:28,488
That poor wretch in the gray flannel
shirt⁠—“It was bad in the

276
00:22:28,488 --> 00:22:31,730
stable,” I said aloud.

277
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,904
For an after-shiver of it went through me.

278
00:22:33,904 --> 00:22:38,681
A third time his hand brushed his
forehead, and I ventured some sympathy.

279
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:41,003
“I’m afraid your head aches.”

280
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:44,123
“I don’t want to keep
seeing Steve,” he muttered.

281
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:44,883
“Steve!”

282
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:46,386
I was astounded.

283
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:49,855
“Why he⁠—why all I saw
of him was splendid.

284
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:51,241
Since it had to be.

285
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:52,254
It was⁠—”

286
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:54,249
“Oh, yes; Ed.

287
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:56,026
You’re thinking about him.

288
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,223
I’d forgot him.

289
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:58,840
So you didn’t enjoy Ed?”

290
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,625
At this I looked at him blankly.

291
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,265
“It isn’t possible that⁠—”

292
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:05,454
Again he cut me short with
a laugh almost savage.

293
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:07,526
“You needn’t to worry about Steve.

294
00:23:07,526 --> -1:59:59,000
He stayed game.

295
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

296
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:14,236
What then had been the matter that he
should keep seeing Steve⁠—that his

297
00:23:14,236 --> 00:23:18,598
vision should so obliterate from him
what I still shivered at,

298
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:20,168
and so shake him now?

299
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:24,178
For he seemed to be growing more stirred
as I grew less.

300
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:28,220
I asked him no further questions,
however, and we went on for several

301
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,891
minutes, he brooding always in the same
fashion, until he resumed with the hard

302
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,884
indifference that had
before surprised me:⁠—

303
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:37,911
“So Ed gave you feelings!

304
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:39,307
Dumb ague and so forth.”

305
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:42,162
“No doubt we’re not made the
same way,” I retorted.

306
00:23:42,162 --> 00:23:43,910
He took no notice of this.

307
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,435
“And you’d have been more comfortable if
he’d acted same as Steve did.

308
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:50,760
It cert’nly was bad seeing Ed take it
that way, I reckon.

309
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,695
And you didn’t see him when the
time came for business.

310
00:23:53,695 --> 00:23:59,406
Well, here’s what it is:
a man may be such a confirmed miscreant

311
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:05,094
that killing’s the only cure for him;
but still he’s your own species,

312
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:10,224
and you don’t want to have him fall
around and grab your laigs and show

313
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:12,344
you his fear naked.

314
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:14,695
It makes you feel ashamed.

315
00:24:14,695 --> 00:24:18,115
So Ed gave you feelings,
and Steve made everything

316
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:19,172
right easy for you!”

317
00:24:19,172 --> 00:24:24,269
There was irony in his voice as he
surveyed me, but it fell away

318
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,714
at once into sadness.

319
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:29,200
“Both was miscreants.

320
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,345
But if Steve had played the coward,
too, it would have been a whole

321
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,725
heap easier for me.”

322
00:24:33,725 --> -1:59:59,000
He paused before adding,
“And Steve was not a miscreant once.

323
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

324
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:41,750
His voice had trembled,
and I felt the deep emotion that seemed

325
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,291
to gain upon him now that action was
over and he had nothing to do but think.

326
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:50,011
And his view was simple enough:
you must die brave.

327
00:24:50,011 --> 00:24:54,609
Failure is a sort of treason to the
brotherhood, and forfeits pity.

328
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:59,202
It was Steve’s perfect bearing that had
caught his heart so that he forgot even

329
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:00,793
his scorn of the other man.

330
00:25:00,793 --> 00:25:03,992
But this was by no means all
that was to come.

331
00:25:03,992 --> 00:25:07,083
He harked back to that notion of a
prisoner helping to make it

332
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,928
easy for his executioner.

333
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:12,784
“Easy plumb to the end,”
he pursued, his mind reviewing the

334
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:13,825
acts of the morning.

335
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:16,784
“Why, he tried to give me your newspaper.

336
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:17,634
I didn’t⁠—”

337
00:25:17,634 --> 00:25:20,697
“Oh, no,” I said hastily.

338
00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:22,128
“I had finished with it.”

339
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:27,087
“Well, he took dying as naturally
as he took living.

340
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:29,089
Like a man should.

341
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:30,293
Like I hope to.”

342
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:32,964
Again he looked at the
pictures in his mind.

343
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,789
“No playacting nor last words.

344
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:41,112
He just told goodbye to the boys as we
led his horse under the limb⁠—you

345
00:25:41,112 --> 00:25:43,926
needn’t to look so dainty,” he broke
off.

346
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:47,133
“You ain’t going to get
any more shocking particulars.”

347
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:50,990
“I know I’m white-livered,”
I said with a species of laugh.

348
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,089
“I never crowd and stare when somebody is
hurt in the street.

349
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:56,011
I get away.”

350
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:57,214
He thought this over.

351
00:25:57,214 --> 00:25:59,277
“You don’t mean all of that.

352
00:25:59,277 --> 00:26:04,296
You’d not have spoke just that way about
crowding and staring if you thought well

353
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,737
of them that stare.

354
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:08,919
Staring ain’t courage;
it’s trashy curiosity.

355
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:10,706
Now you did not have this thing⁠—”

356
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:16,763
He had stretched out his hand to point,
but it fell, and his utterance stopped,

357
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:18,691
and he jerked his horse to a stand.

358
00:26:18,691 --> 00:26:25,094
My nerves sprang like a wire at his
suddenness, and I looked

359
00:26:25,094 --> 00:26:26,184
where he was looking.

360
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,971
There were the cottonwoods,
close in front of us.

361
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:33,818
As we had travelled and talked
we had forgotten them.

362
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:37,158
Now they were looming within a hundred
yards; and our trail

363
00:26:37,158 --> 00:26:38,597
lay straight through them.

364
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,085
“Let’s go around them,”
said the Virginian.

365
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:46,482
When we had come back from our circuit
into the trail he continued:

366
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:49,122
“You did not have that thing to do.

367
00:26:49,122 --> 00:26:52,793
But a man goes through with his
responsibilities⁠—and

368
00:26:52,793 --> 00:26:54,155
I reckon you could.”

369
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,492
“I hope so,” I answered.

370
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:57,530
“How about Ed?”

371
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,566
“He was not a man, though we thought
he was till this.

372
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:03,726
Steve and I started punching cattle
together at the Bordeaux

373
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:05,415
outfit, north of Cheyenne.

374
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:12,670
We did everything together in those
days⁠—work and play.

375
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,092
Six years ago.

376
00:27:16,092 --> -1:59:59,000
Steve had many good points onced.

377
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

378
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,883
We must have gone two miles
before he spoke again.

379
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:24,745
“You prob’ly didn’t notice Steve?

380
00:27:24,745 --> 00:27:26,560
I mean the way he acted to me?”

381
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,403
It was a question, but he did not
wait for my answer.

382
00:27:29,403 --> 00:27:32,669
“Steve never said a word
to me all through.

383
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:33,535
He shunned it.

384
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:37,618
And you saw how neighborly he talked
to the other boys.”

385
00:27:37,618 --> 00:27:38,978
“Where have they all gone?”

386
00:27:38,978 --> 00:27:39,723
I asked.

387
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:41,270
He smiled at me.

388
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,428
“It cert’nly is lonesome now, for a fact.”

389
00:27:44,428 --> 00:27:47,113
“I didn’t know you felt it,” said I.

390
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:49,647
“Feel it!⁠—they’ve went to the railroad.

391
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:54,924
Three of them are witnesses in a case at
Evanston, and the Judge wants our

392
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,891
outfit at Medicine Bow.

393
00:27:56,891 --> 00:27:58,094
Steve shunned me.

394
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,216
Did he think I was going back on him?”

395
00:28:00,216 --> 00:28:01,254
“What if he did?

396
00:28:01,254 --> 00:28:02,245
You were not.

397
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:05,806
And so nobody’s going to
Wind River but you?”

398
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:07,162
“No.

399
00:28:07,162 --> 00:28:10,713
Did you notice Steve would not give us
any information about Shorty?

400
00:28:10,713 --> 00:28:11,526
That was right.

401
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:13,450
I would have acted that way, too.”

402
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,977
Thus, each time, he brought me
back to the subject.

403
00:28:16,977 --> 00:28:21,665
The sun was now shining warm during two
or three minutes together,

404
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:26,538
and gulfs of blue opened in
the great white clouds.

405
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:32,965
These moved and met among each other,
and parted, like hands spread out,

406
00:28:32,965 --> 00:28:38,885
slowly weaving a spell of sleep over the
day after the wakeful night storm.

407
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:43,725
The huge contours of the earth lay
basking and drying, and not one living

408
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:47,287
creature, bird or beast, was in sight.

409
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:51,338
Quiet was returning to my revived
spirits, but there was

410
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:53,041
none for the Virginian.

411
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:58,529
And as he reasoned matters out aloud,
his mood grew more overcast.

412
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:01,118
“You have a friend, and his
ways are your ways.

413
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:05,530
You travel together, you spree together
confidentially, and you suit each other

414
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,707
down to the ground.

415
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:11,899
Then one day you find him putting his
iron on another man’s calf.

416
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:16,965
You tell him fair and square those ways
have never been your ways and ain’t

417
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,448
going to be your ways.

418
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:22,906
Well, that does not change him any,
for it seems he’s disturbed over getting

419
00:29:22,906 --> 00:29:25,811
rich quick and being a big
man in the Territory.

420
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:30,913
And the years go on, until you are
foreman of Judge Henry’s ranch and he⁠—

421
00:29:30,913 --> 00:29:33,065
is dangling back in the cottonwoods.

422
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:34,658
What can he claim?

423
00:29:34,658 --> 00:29:36,209
Who made the choice?

424
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:41,716
He cannot say, ‘Here is my old friend
that I would have stood by.’

425
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:42,967
Can he say that?”

426
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:46,082
“But he didn’t say it,” I protested.

427
00:29:46,082 --> 00:29:46,813
“No.

428
00:29:46,813 --> 00:29:47,955
He shunned me.”

429
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:49,376
“Listen,” I said.

430
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:52,561
“Suppose while you were on guard he had
whispered, ‘Get me off’⁠—would

431
00:29:52,561 --> 00:29:53,418
you have done it?”

432
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:54,857
“No, sir!”

433
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:56,893
said the Virginian, hotly.

434
00:29:56,893 --> 00:29:58,176
“Then what do you want?”

435
00:29:58,176 --> 00:29:58,985
I asked.

436
00:29:58,985 --> 00:30:00,062
“What did you want?”

437
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:03,655
He could not answer me⁠—but I had not
answered him, I saw;

438
00:30:03,655 --> 00:30:05,104
so I pushed it farther.

439
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:08,521
“Did you want endorsement from the
man you were hanging?

440
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:10,430
That’s asking a little too much.”

441
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,115
But he had now another confusion.

442
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:16,229
“Steve stood by Shorty,” he said musingly.

443
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:20,167
“It was Shorty’s mistake cost him his
life, but all the same he didn’t

444
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:22,022
want us to catch⁠—”

445
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:25,120
“You are mixing things,” I interrupted.

446
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,320
“I never heard you mix things before.

447
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,783
And it was not Shorty’s mistake.”

448
00:30:32,783 --> 00:30:35,231
He showed momentary interest.

449
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:36,219
“Whose then?”

450
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:40,167
“The mistake of whoever took a
fool into their enterprise.”

451
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:41,017
“That’s correct.

452
00:30:41,017 --> -1:59:59,000
Well, Trampas took Shorty in,
and Steve would not tell on him either.

453
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

454
00:30:45,222 --> 00:30:48,758
I still tried it, saying,
“They were all in the same boat.”

455
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:52,157
But logic was useless;
he had lost his bearings in

456
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:53,696
a fog of sentiment.

457
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,750
He knew, knew passionately,
that he had done right;

458
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:03,890
but the silence of his old friend to him
through those last hours left a sting

459
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,431
that no reasoning could assuage.

460
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:10,103
“He told goodbye to the rest of the boys;
but not to me.”

461
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:14,015
And nothing that I could point out in
common sense turned him from the thread

462
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:15,296
of his own argument.

463
00:31:15,296 --> 00:31:20,415
He worked round the circle
again to self-justification.

464
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:23,104
“Was it him I was deserting?

465
00:31:23,104 --> 00:31:28,731
Was not the deserting done by him the day
I spoke my mind about stealing calves?

466
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:31,663
I have kept my ways the same.

467
00:31:31,663 --> 00:31:34,030
He is the one that took to new ones.

468
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:37,499
The man I used to travel with is not
the man back there.

469
00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:42,194
Same name, to be sure.

470
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:43,946
And same body.

471
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:47,331
But different in⁠—and yet
he had the memory!

472
00:31:47,331 --> 00:31:49,926
You can’t never change your memory!”

473
00:31:49,926 --> 00:31:51,091
He gave a sob.

474
00:31:51,091 --> 00:31:54,931
It was the first I had ever heard from
him, and before I knew what I was doing

475
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:59,840
I had reined my horse up to his and put
my arm around his shoulders.

476
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,089
I had no sooner touched him than
he was utterly overcome.

477
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:07,068
“I knew Steve awful well,” he said.

478
00:32:07,068 --> 00:32:11,667
Thus we had actually come to change
places; for early in the morning he had

479
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:15,827
been firm while I was unnerved,
while now it was I who attempted to

480
00:32:15,827 --> 00:32:17,119
steady and comfort him.

481
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,531
I had the sense to keep silent,
and presently he shook my hand,

482
00:32:21,531 --> 00:32:23,238
not looking at me as he did so.

483
00:32:23,238 --> 00:32:26,287
He was always very shy of demonstration.

484
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:29,673
And he took to patting the
neck of his pony.

485
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:34,231
“You Monte hawss,” said he,
“you think you are wise,

486
00:32:34,231 --> 00:32:37,248
but there’s a lot of
things you don’t savvy.”

487
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:40,521
Then he made a new beginning
of talk between us.

488
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:43,302
“It is kind of pitiful about Shorty.”

489
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:45,272
“Very pitiful,” I said.

490
00:32:45,272 --> 00:32:46,672
“Do you know about him?”

491
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:48,342
the Virginian asked.

492
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:53,418
“I know there’s no real harm in him,
and some real good, and that he has not

493
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:56,525
got the brains necessary to
be a horse thief.”

494
00:32:56,525 --> 00:32:57,170
“That’s so.

495
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,392
That’s very true.

496
00:32:58,392 --> 00:33:02,263
Trampas has led him in deeper than
his stature can stand.

497
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:06,095
Now back East you can be
middling and get along.

498
00:33:06,095 --> 00:33:09,616
But if you go to try a thing on in this
Western country, you’ve got

499
00:33:09,616 --> 00:33:10,535
to do it well.

500
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:13,854
You’ve got to deal cyards well;
you’ve got to steal well;

501
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:17,366
and if you claim to be quick with your
gun, you must be quick,

502
00:33:17,366 --> 00:33:21,056
for you’re a public temptation,
and some man will not resist trying to

503
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:23,199
prove he is the quicker.

504
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:27,441
You must break all the Commandments well
in this Western country,

505
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:30,760
and Shorty should have stayed in
Brooklyn, for he will be a

506
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,415
novice his livelong days.

507
00:33:33,415 --> 00:33:34,874
You don’t know about him?

508
00:33:34,874 --> 00:33:37,085
He has told me his circumstances.

509
00:33:37,085 --> 00:33:39,600
He don’t remember his father,
and it was like he could have

510
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,799
claimed three or four.

511
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,063
And I expect his mother was not much
interested in him before or

512
00:33:45,063 --> 00:33:46,420
after he was born.

513
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,395
He ran around, and when he was eighteen
he got to be help to a grocery man.

514
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:57,768
But a girl he ran with kept taking all
his pay and teasing him for more,

515
00:33:57,768 --> 00:34:05,192
and so one day the grocery man caught
Shorty robbing his till, and fired him.

516
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:09,009
There wasn’t no one to tell goodbye to,
for the girl had to go to the country to

517
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:10,436
see her aunt, she said.

518
00:34:10,436 --> 00:34:15,031
So Shorty hung around the store and
kissed the grocery cat goodbye.

519
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:18,184
He’d been used to feeding the cat,
and she’d sit in his lap and

520
00:34:18,184 --> 00:34:19,747
purr, he told me.

521
00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:21,997
He sends money back to that girl now.

522
00:34:21,997 --> 00:34:26,801
This hyeh country is no country for
Shorty, for he will be a conspicuous

523
00:34:26,801 --> -1:59:59,000
novice all his days.

524
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

525
00:34:29,461 --> 00:34:33,492
“Perhaps he’ll prefer honesty after his
narrow shave,” I said.

526
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:36,469
But the Virginian shook his head.

527
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,138
“Trampas has got hold of him.”

528
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:43,134
The day was now all blue above,
and all warm and dry beneath.

529
00:34:43,134 --> 00:34:48,273
We had begun to wind in and rise among
the first slopes of the foothills,

530
00:34:48,273 --> 00:34:51,025
and we had talked ourselves into
silence.

531
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:55,512
At the first running water we made a long
nooning, and I slept on the bare ground.

532
00:34:55,512 --> 00:35:02,583
My body was lodged so fast and deep in
slumber that when the Virginian shook me

533
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:08,298
awake I could not come back to life at
once; it was the clump of cottonwoods,

534
00:35:08,298 --> 00:35:12,823
small and far out in the plain below
us, that recalled me.

535
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:17,401
“It’ll not be watching us much
longer,” said the Virginian.

536
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:22,028
He made it a sort of joke;
but I knew that both of us were glad

537
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:26,696
when presently we rode into a steeper
country, and among its folds and

538
00:35:26,696 --> 00:35:31,696
carvings lost all sight of the plain.

539
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,576
He had not slept, I found.

540
00:35:33,576 --> 00:35:37,776
His explanation was that the packs needed
better balancing, and after that he had

541
00:35:37,776 --> 00:35:40,454
gone up and down the stream on
the chance of trout.

542
00:35:40,454 --> 00:35:45,295
But his haunted eyes gave me the real
reason⁠—they spoke of Steve,

543
00:35:45,295 --> 00:35:48,546
no matter what he spoke of;
it was to be no short thing with him.

544
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:49,820
CHAPTER XXXII

545
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,229
Superstition Trail

546
00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:55,912
We did not make thirty-five miles that
day, nor yet twenty-five,

547
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:57,156
for he had let me sleep.

548
00:35:57,156 --> 00:36:00,878
We made an early camp and tried some
unsuccessful fishing,

549
00:36:00,878 --> 00:36:04,564
over which he was cheerful,
promising trout tomorrow when we should

550
00:36:04,564 --> 00:36:06,302
be higher among the mountains.

551
00:36:06,302 --> 00:36:09,876
He never again touched or came near the
subject that was on his mind,

552
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:14,652
but while I sat writing my diary,
he went off to his horse Monte,

553
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:17,153
and I could hear that he occasionally
talked to that friend.

554
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:22,559
Next day we swung southward from what is
known to many as the Conant trail,

555
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:28,724
and headed for that shortcut through the
Tetons which is known to but a few.

556
00:36:28,724 --> 00:36:33,502
Bitch Creek was the name of the stream we
now followed, and here there was such

557
00:36:33,502 --> 00:36:36,376
good fishing that we idled;
and the horses and I

558
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:38,715
at least enjoyed ourselves.

559
00:36:38,715 --> 00:36:43,302
For they found fresh pastures and shade
in the now plentiful woods;

560
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:46,942
and the mountain odors and the mountain
heights were enough for me when the

561
00:36:46,942 --> 00:36:49,302
fish refused to rise.

562
00:36:49,302 --> 00:36:55,254
This road of ours now became the road
which the pursuit had

563
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,816
taken before the capture.

564
00:36:56,816 --> 00:37:02,533
Going along, I noticed the footprints of
many hoofs, rain-blurred but recent,

565
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:05,893
and these were the tracks of the people
I had met in the stable.

566
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,185
“You can notice Monte’s,”
said the Virginian.

567
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,506
“He is the only one that has
his hind feet shod.

568
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:16,791
There’s several trails from this point
down to where we have come from.”

569
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:23,803
We mounted now over a long slant of rock,
smooth and of wide extent.

570
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:27,153
Above us it went up easily into a little
side canyon, but ahead,

571
00:37:27,153 --> 00:37:32,398
where our way was, it grew so steep that
we got off and led our horses.

572
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:36,718
This brought us to the next higher level
of the mountain, a space of sagebrush

573
00:37:36,718 --> 00:37:41,715
more open, where the rain-washed tracks
appeared again in the softer ground.

574
00:37:41,715 --> 00:37:45,823
“Someone has been here since the rain,”
I called to the Virginian,

575
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:49,377
who was still on the rock,
walking up behind the packhorses.

576
00:37:49,377 --> 00:37:50,066
“Since the rain!”

577
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:50,930
he exclaimed.

578
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,286
“That’s not two days yet.”

579
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:54,451
He came and examined the footprints.

580
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:59,384
“A man and a hawss,” he said, frowning.

581
00:37:59,384 --> 00:38:00,960
“Going the same way we are.

582
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,074
How did he come to pass us,
and us not see him?”

583
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,923
“One of the other trails,” I reminded him.

584
00:38:07,923 --> 00:38:11,256
“Yes, but there’s not
many that knows them.

585
00:38:11,256 --> -1:59:59,000
They are pretty rough trails.

586
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

587
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:14,989
“Worse than this one we’re taking?”

588
00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:18,279
“Not much; only how does he come to
know any of them?

589
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:22,140
And why don’t he take the Conant trail
that’s open and easy and not much

590
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,713
longer?

591
00:38:22,713 --> 00:38:24,115
One man and a hawss.

592
00:38:24,115 --> 00:38:27,745
I don’t see who he is or
what he wants here.”

593
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:30,206
“Probably a prospector,” I suggested.

594
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:34,766
“Only one outfit of prospectors has ever
been here, and they claimed there was no

595
00:38:34,766 --> -1:59:59,000
mineral-bearing rock in these parts.

596
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

597
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:41,389
We got back into our saddles
with the mystery unsolved.

598
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:46,307
To the Virginian it was a greater one,
apparently, than to me;

599
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:50,263
why should one have to account for every
stray traveller in the mountains?

600
00:38:50,263 --> 00:38:52,980
“That’s queer, too,” said the Virginian.

601
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,380
He was now riding in front of me,
and he stopped, looking

602
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,452
down at the trail.

603
00:38:58,452 --> 00:38:59,661
“Don’t you notice?”

604
00:38:59,661 --> 00:39:01,222
It did not strike me.

605
00:39:01,222 --> 00:39:05,209
“Why, he keeps walking beside his hawss;
he don’t get on him.”

606
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:11,016
Now we, of course, had mounted at the
beginning of the better trail after the

607
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:14,963
steep rock, and that was quite
half a mile back.

608
00:39:14,963 --> 00:39:17,559
Still, I had a natural explanation.

609
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,479
“He’s leading a packhorse.

610
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:21,418
He’s a poor trapper, and walks.”

611
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:26,128
“Packhorses ain’t usually shod before and
behind,” said the Virginian;

612
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:28,894
and sliding to the ground
he touched the footprints.

613
00:39:28,894 --> 00:39:31,731
“They are not four hours old,” said he.

614
00:39:31,731 --> -1:59:59,000
“This bank’s in shadow by one o’clock,
and the sun has not cooked them dusty.

615
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

616
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:41,057
We continued on our way;
and although it seemed no very

617
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:48,294
particular thing to me that a man should
choose to walk and lead his horse for a

618
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:53,617
while⁠—I often did so to limber my
muscles⁠—nevertheless I began to catch

619
00:39:53,617 --> 00:39:57,617
the Virginian’s uncertain feeling about
this traveller whose steps had appeared

620
00:39:57,617 --> 00:40:01,879
on our path in mid-journey,
as if he had alighted from the midair,

621
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:07,439
and to remind myself that he had come
over the great face of rock from another

622
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:12,997
trail and thus joined us,
and that indigent trappers are to be

623
00:40:12,997 --> 00:40:18,348
found owning but a single horse and
leading him with their belongings

624
00:40:18,348 --> 00:40:25,258
through the deepest solitudes of the
mountains⁠—none of this quite brought

625
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:30,320
back to me the comfort which had been
mine since we left the cottonwoods out

626
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,055
of sight down in the plain.

627
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:35,958
Hence I called out sharply,
“What’s the matter now?”

628
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:39,166
when the Virginian suddenly
stopped his horse again.

629
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:42,955
He looked down at the trail,
and then he very slowly turned round in

630
00:40:42,955 --> 00:40:45,950
his saddle and stared
back steadily at me.

631
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,556
“There’s two of them,” he said.

632
00:40:48,556 --> 00:40:49,418
“Two what?”

633
00:40:49,418 --> 00:40:50,911
“I don’t know.”

634
00:40:50,911 --> 00:40:56,515
“You must know whether it’s two horses or
two men,” I said, almost angrily.

635
00:40:56,515 --> 00:41:00,512
But to this he made no answer,
sitting quite still on his horse

636
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:02,134
and contemplating the ground.

637
00:41:02,134 --> 00:41:06,511
The silence was fastening on me like a
spell, and I spurred my horse

638
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,740
impatiently forward to see for myself.

639
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:13,664
The footprints of two men were
there in the trail.

640
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:15,264
“What do you say to that?”

641
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,337
said the Virginian.

642
00:41:16,337 --> 00:41:17,984
“Kind of ridiculous, ain’t it?”

643
00:41:17,984 --> 00:41:23,302
“Very quaint,” I answered,
groping for the explanation.

644
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:28,392
There was no rock here to walk over and
step from into the softer trail.

645
00:41:28,392 --> 00:41:32,552
These second steps came more out of the
air than the first.

646
00:41:32,552 --> 00:41:36,912
And my brain played me the evil trick of
showing me a dead man in

647
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,512
a gray flannel shirt.

648
00:41:38,512 --> 00:41:43,625
“It’s two, you see, travelling with one
hawss, and they take turns riding him.”

649
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:44,746
“Why, of course!”

650
00:41:44,746 --> 00:41:47,966
I exclaimed; and we went along
for a few paces.

651
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:53,070
“There you are,” said the Virginian,
as the trail proved him right.

652
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,050
“Number one has got on.

653
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,617
My God, what’s that?”

654
00:41:57,617 --> 00:42:02,616
At a crashing in the woods very close to
us we both flung round and caught sight

655
00:42:02,616 --> 00:42:03,767
of a vanishing elk.

656
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:07,307
It left us confronted,
smiling a little, and sounding each

657
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:08,759
other with our eyes.

658
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:12,022
“Well, we didn’t need him for
meat,” said the Virginian.

659
00:42:12,022 --> 00:42:13,882
“A spike-horn, wasn’t it?”

660
00:42:13,882 --> 00:42:14,702
said I.

661
00:42:14,702 --> 00:42:16,988
“Yes, just a spike-horn.”

662
00:42:16,988 --> 00:42:21,584
For a while now as we rode we kept up a
cheerful conversation about elk.

663
00:42:21,584 --> 00:42:25,435
We wondered if we should meet many more
close to the trail like this;

664
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:28,625
but it was not long before
our words died away.

665
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:33,687
We had come into a veritable gulf of
mountain peaks, sharp at their bare

666
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:39,487
summits like teeth, holding fields of
snow lower down, and glittering still in

667
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:44,767
full day up there, while down among our
pines and parks the afternoon

668
00:42:44,767 --> 00:42:46,136
was growing sombre.

669
00:42:46,136 --> 00:42:50,488
All the while the fresh hoofprints of the
horse and the fresh footprints of

670
00:42:50,488 --> 00:42:52,208
the man preceded us.

671
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:56,441
In the trees, and in the opens,
across the levels, and up the

672
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:58,383
steeps, they were there.

673
00:42:58,383 --> 00:43:00,781
And so they were not four hours old!

674
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:01,975
Were they so much?

675
00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:05,776
Might we not, round some turn,
come upon the makers of them?

676
00:43:05,776 --> 00:43:07,862
I began to watch for this.

677
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:11,742
And again my brain played me an evil
trick, against which I found myself

678
00:43:11,742 --> 00:43:15,836
actually reasoning thus:
if they took turns riding,

679
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:19,225
then walking must tire them as it did
me or any man.

680
00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:22,188
And besides, there was a horse.

681
00:43:22,188 --> 00:43:27,128
With such thoughts I combated the fancy
that those footprints were being made

682
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:34,121
immediately in front of us all the
while, and that they were the only sign

683
00:43:34,121 --> 00:43:38,765
of any presence which our eyes could
see.

684
00:43:38,765 --> 00:43:41,655
But my fancy overcame my thoughts.

685
00:43:41,655 --> 00:43:45,359
It was shame only which held me from
asking this question of the Virginian:

686
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:50,209
Had one horse served in both cases of
Justice down at the cottonwoods?

687
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:51,773
I wondered about this.

688
00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:58,358
One horse⁠—or had the strangling nooses
dragged two saddles empty

689
00:43:58,358 --> 00:43:59,589
at the same signal?

690
00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:04,151
Most likely; and therefore these people
up here⁠—Was I going back to the

691
00:44:04,151 --> 00:44:04,896
nursery?

692
00:44:04,896 --> 00:44:06,596
I brought myself up short.

693
00:44:06,596 --> 00:44:11,124
And I told myself to be steady;
there lurked in this brain-process which

694
00:44:11,124 --> 00:44:14,643
was going on beneath my reason a threat
worse than the childish

695
00:44:14,643 --> 00:44:16,262
apprehensions it created.

696
00:44:16,262 --> 00:44:21,002
I reminded myself that I was a man grown,
twenty-five years old,

697
00:44:21,002 --> 00:44:24,593
and that I must not merely seem like
one, but feel like one.

698
00:44:24,593 --> 00:44:27,685
“You’re not afraid of
the dark, I suppose?”

699
00:44:27,685 --> 00:44:30,557
This I uttered aloud, unwittingly.

700
00:44:30,557 --> 00:44:31,327
“What’s that?”

701
00:44:31,327 --> 00:44:34,006
I started; but it was only
the Virginian behind me.

702
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:35,270
“Oh, nothing.

703
00:44:35,270 --> -1:59:59,000
The air is getting colder up here.

704
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

705
00:44:36,906 --> 00:44:38,978
I had presently a great relief.

706
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:44,592
We came to a place where again this trail
mounted so abruptly that we once more

707
00:44:44,592 --> 00:44:46,846
got off to lead our horses.

708
00:44:46,846 --> 00:44:51,259
So likewise had our predecessors done;
and as I watched the two different sets

709
00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:56,007
of footprints, I observed something and
hastened to speak of it.

710
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:58,517
“One man is much heavier than the other.”

711
00:44:58,517 --> 00:45:01,885
“I was hoping I’d not have to tell you
that,” said the Virginian.

712
00:45:01,885 --> 00:45:03,713
“You’re always ahead of me!

713
00:45:03,713 --> 00:45:06,099
Well, still my education is progressing.”

714
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:07,692
“Why, yes.

715
00:45:07,692 --> 00:45:10,460
You’ll equal an Injun if you keep on.”

716
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,407
It was good to be facetious;
and I smiled to myself

717
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:15,359
as I trudged upward.

718
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,885
We came off the steep place,
leaving the canyon beneath us,

719
00:45:18,885 --> 00:45:20,125
and took to horseback.

720
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:25,125
And as we proceeded over the final gentle
slant up to the rim of the great basin

721
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:30,018
that was set among the peaks,
the Virginian was jocular once more.

722
00:45:30,018 --> -1:59:59,000
“Pounds has got on,” said he,
“and Ounces is walking.

723
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

724
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:38,830
I glanced over my shoulder at him,
and he nodded as he fixed the weather-

725
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:41,217
beaten crimson handkerchief
round his neck.

726
00:45:41,217 --> 00:45:44,670
Then he threw a stone at a pack animal
that was delaying on the trail.

727
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,830
“Damn your buckskin hide,” he drawled.

728
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,328
“You can view the scenery from the top.”

729
00:45:50,328 --> 00:45:56,157
He was so natural, sitting loose in the
saddle, and cursing in his gentle voice,

730
00:45:56,157 --> 00:45:59,683
that I laughed to think what visions
I had been harboring.

731
00:45:59,683 --> 00:46:03,537
The two dead men riding one horse through
the mountains vanished,

732
00:46:03,537 --> 00:46:05,178
and I came back to every day.

733
00:46:05,178 --> 00:46:07,819
“Do you think we’ll catch
up with those people?”

734
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:09,114
I asked.

735
00:46:09,114 --> 00:46:09,970
“Not likely.

736
00:46:09,970 --> -1:59:59,000
They’re travelling about the
same gait we are.

737
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

738
00:46:12,592 --> 00:46:16,819
“Ounces ought to be the best walker.”

739
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:19,270
“Up hill, yes.

740
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:22,356
But Pounds will go down a-foggin’.”

741
00:46:22,356 --> 00:46:25,475
We gained the rim of the basin.

742
00:46:25,475 --> 00:46:32,744
It lay below us, a great cup of country⁠—
rocks, woods, opens, and streams.

743
00:46:32,744 --> 00:46:38,710
The tall peaks rose like spires around
it, magnificent and bare in the last of

744
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:44,113
the sun; and we surveyed this upper
world, letting our animals get breath.

745
00:46:44,113 --> 00:46:48,182
Our bleak, crumbled rim ran like a
rampart between the towering tops,

746
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:52,685
a half circle of five miles or six,
very wide in some parts,

747
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:56,618
and in some shrinking to a
scanty foothold, as here.

748
00:46:56,618 --> 00:47:02,588
Here our trail crossed over it between
two eroded and fantastic shapes of

749
00:47:02,588 --> 00:47:06,584
stone, like mushrooms,
or misshapen heads on pikes.

750
00:47:06,584 --> 00:47:11,200
Banks of snow spread up here against the
black rocks, but half an hour would see

751
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,181
us descended to the green and the woods.

752
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:18,894
I looked down, both of us looked down,
but our forerunners were not there.

753
00:47:18,894 --> 00:47:22,437
“They’ll be camping somewhere in this
basin, though,” said the Virginian,

754
00:47:22,437 --> 00:47:24,194
staring at the dark pines.

755
00:47:24,194 --> 00:47:26,820
“They have not come this
trail by accident.”

756
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:32,604
A cold little wind blew down between our
stone shapes, and upward again, eddying.

757
00:47:32,604 --> 00:47:37,800
And round a corner upward with it came
fluttering a leaf of newspaper,

758
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,783
and caught against an edge close to me.

759
00:47:39,783 --> 00:47:41,111
“What’s the latest?”

760
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:43,435
inquired the Virginian from his horse.

761
00:47:43,435 --> 00:47:47,053
For I had dismounted,
and had picked up the leaf.

762
00:47:47,053 --> 00:47:50,511
“Seems to be interesting,”
I next heard him say.

763
00:47:50,511 --> 00:47:54,153
“Can’t you tell a man what’s making your
eyes bug out so?”

764
00:47:54,153 --> 00:47:59,416
“Yes,” my voice replied to him,
and it sounded like some stranger

765
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:03,006
speaking lightly near by; “oh, yes!

766
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:04,846
Decidedly interesting.”

767
00:48:04,846 --> 00:48:07,935
My voice mimicked his pronunciation.

768
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:10,348
“It’s quite the latest, I imagine.

769
00:48:10,348 --> 00:48:12,095
You had better read it yourself.”

770
00:48:12,095 --> 00:48:15,852
And I handed it to him with a smile,
watching his countenance,

771
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:19,388
while my brain felt as if clouds
were rushing through it.

772
00:48:19,388 --> 00:48:22,429
I saw his eyes quietly
run the headings over.

773
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:23,356
“Well?”

774
00:48:23,356 --> 00:48:26,589
he inquired, after scanning
it on both sides.

775
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:28,809
“I don’t seem to catch the excitement.

776
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:32,513
Fremont County is going to hold elections.

777
00:48:32,513 --> 00:48:34,097
I see they claim Jake⁠—”

778
00:48:34,097 --> 00:48:38,541
“It’s mine,” I cut him off.

779
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,922
“My own paper.

780
00:48:39,922 --> 00:48:41,547
Those are my pencil marks.”

781
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:45,658
I do not think that a microscope could
have discerned a change in his face.

782
00:48:45,658 --> 00:48:50,868
“Oh,” he commented, holding the paper,
and fixing it with a critical eye.

783
00:48:50,868 --> 00:48:54,193
“You mean this is the one you lent Steve,
and he wanted to give me to

784
00:48:54,193 --> 00:48:55,096
give back to you.

785
00:48:55,096 --> 00:48:57,102
And so them are your own marks.”

786
00:48:57,102 --> 00:49:01,942
For a moment more he held it judicially,
as I have seen men hold a contract upon

787
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,862
whose terms they were finally passing.

788
00:49:03,862 --> 00:49:06,622
“Well, you have got it back now, anyway.”

789
00:49:06,622 --> 00:49:07,702
And he handed it to me.

790
00:49:07,702 --> 00:49:09,698
“Only a piece of it!”

791
00:49:09,698 --> 00:49:12,224
I exclaimed, always lightly.

792
00:49:12,224 --> 00:49:18,235
And as I took it from him his hand
chanced to touch mine.

793
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:20,607
It was cold as ice.

794
00:49:20,607 --> 00:49:25,427
“They ain’t through readin’ the
rest,” he explained easily.

795
00:49:25,427 --> 00:49:27,273
“Don’t you throw it away!

796
00:49:27,273 --> 00:49:29,534
After they’ve taken such trouble.”

797
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:31,584
“That’s true,” I answered.

798
00:49:31,584 --> 00:49:35,002
“I wonder if it’s Pounds or
Ounces I’m indebted to.”

799
00:49:35,002 --> 00:49:39,254
Thus we made further merriment as we rode
down into the great basin.

800
00:49:39,254 --> 00:49:44,341
Before us, the horse and boot tracks
showed plain in the soft slough where

801
00:49:44,341 --> 00:49:46,461
melted snow ran half the day.

802
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:50,266
“If it’s a paper chase,”
said the Virginian, “they’ll drop

803
00:49:50,266 --> 00:49:51,708
no more along here.”

804
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:54,114
“Unless it gets dark,” said I.

805
00:49:54,114 --> 00:49:55,728
“We’ll camp before that.

806
00:49:55,728 --> 00:49:57,768
Maybe we’ll see their fire.”

807
00:49:57,768 --> 00:49:59,619
We did not see their fire.

808
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:04,781
We descended in the chill silence,
while the mushroom rocks grew far and

809
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:08,474
the sombre woods approached.

810
00:50:08,474 --> 00:50:13,526
By a stream we got off where two banks
sheltered us; for a bleak wind cut down

811
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:18,999
over the crags now and then,
making the pines send out a great note

812
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:22,182
through the basin, like breakers
in a heavy sea.

813
00:50:22,182 --> 00:50:24,756
But we made cozy in the tent.

814
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:27,668
We pitched the tent this night,
and I was glad to have it shut

815
00:50:27,668 --> 00:50:29,202
out the mountain peaks.

816
00:50:29,202 --> 00:50:33,660
They showed above the banks where we
camped; and in the starlight their black

817
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,482
shapes rose stark against the sky.

818
00:50:36,482 --> 00:50:41,993
They, with the pines and the wind,
were a bedroom too unearthly this night.

819
00:50:41,993 --> 00:50:46,513
And as soon as our supper dishes were
washed we went inside to our lantern and

820
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:47,983
our game of cribbage.

821
00:50:47,983 --> 00:50:51,221
“This is snug,” said the
Virginian, as we played.

822
00:50:51,221 --> 00:50:53,129
“That wind don’t get down here.”

823
00:50:53,129 --> 00:50:55,831
“Smoking is snug, too,” said I.

824
00:50:55,831 --> 00:51:01,081
And we marked our points for an hour,
with no words save about the cards.

825
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:04,932
“I’ll be pretty near glad when we get out
of these mountains,” said the Virginian.

826
00:51:04,932 --> 00:51:06,247
“They’re most too big.”

827
00:51:06,247 --> 00:51:11,272
The pines had altogether ceased;
but their silence was as tremendous as

828
00:51:11,272 --> 00:51:12,632
their roar had been.

829
00:51:12,632 --> 00:51:15,393
“I don’t know, though,” he resumed.

830
00:51:15,393 --> 00:51:20,214
“There’s times when the plains can
be awful big, too.”

831
00:51:20,214 --> 00:51:26,017
Presently we finished a hand,
and he said, “Let me see that paper.”

832
00:51:26,017 --> 00:51:31,010
He sat reading it apparently through,
while I arranged my blankets to

833
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:34,971
make a warm bed.

834
00:51:34,971 --> 00:51:40,554
Then, since the paper continued to absorb
him, I got myself ready,

835
00:51:40,554 --> 00:51:43,256
and slid between my blankets
for the night.

836
00:51:43,256 --> 00:51:46,896
“You’ll need another candle soon in
that lantern,” said I.

837
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:48,942
He put the paper down.

838
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:51,629
“I would do it all over again,” he began.

839
00:51:51,629 --> 00:51:53,902
“The whole thing just the same.

840
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:57,416
He knowed the customs of the country,
and he played the game.

841
00:51:57,416 --> 00:52:00,976
No call to blame me for the
customs of the country.

842
00:52:00,976 --> 00:52:07,219
You leave other folks’ cattle alone,
or you take the consequences,

843
00:52:07,219 --> 00:52:10,543
and it was all known to
Steve from the start.

844
00:52:10,543 --> 00:52:14,422
Would he have me take the Judge’s wages
and give him the wink?

845
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:18,707
He must have changed a heap from the
Steve I knew if he expected that.

846
00:52:18,707 --> 00:52:20,355
I don’t believe he expected that.

847
00:52:20,355 --> 00:52:23,570
He knew well enough the only thing that
would have let him off would have

848
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:25,639
been a regular jury.

849
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:29,210
For the thieves have got hold of the
juries in Johnson County.

850
00:52:29,210 --> -1:59:59,000
I would do it all over, just the same.

851
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

852
00:52:32,544 --> 00:52:37,550
The expiring flame leaped in the
lantern, and fell blue.

853
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:42,613
He broke off in his words as if to
arrange the light, but did not,

854
00:52:42,613 --> 00:52:47,366
sitting silent instead,
just visible, and seeming to watch the

855
00:52:47,366 --> 00:52:49,300
death struggle of the flame.

856
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:53,526
I could find nothing to say to him,
and I believed he was now winning his

857
00:52:53,526 --> 00:52:56,101
way back to serenity by himself.

858
00:52:56,101 --> 00:53:01,069
He kept his outward man so nearly natural
that I forgot about that cold touch of

859
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:02,349
his hand, and never guessed

860
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:02,549
how

861
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:02,949
far

862
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:07,893
out from reason the tide of emotion was
even now whirling him.

863
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:12,481
“I remember at Cheyenne
onced,” he resumed.

864
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:17,336
And he told me of a Thanksgiving visit to
town that he had made with Steve.

865
00:53:17,336 --> 00:53:22,114
“We was just colts then,” he said.

866
00:53:22,114 --> 00:53:26,704
He dwelt on their coltish doings,
their adventures sought and wrought in

867
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,845
the perfect fellowship of youth.

868
00:53:28,845 --> 00:53:33,638
“For Steve and me most always hunted in
couples back in them

869
00:53:33,638 --> 00:53:36,254
gamesome years,” he explained.

870
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:41,387
And he fell into the elemental talk of
sex, such talk as would be an elk’s or

871
00:53:41,387 --> 00:53:45,120
tiger’s; and spoken so by him,
simply and naturally,

872
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:49,220
as we speak of the seasons,
or of death, or of any actuality,

873
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,120
it was without offense.

874
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,574
It would be offense should I repeat it.

875
00:53:53,574 --> 00:53:57,832
Then, abruptly ending these memories of
himself and Steve, he went out of the

876
00:53:57,832 --> 00:54:00,845
tent, and I heard him dragging a
log to the fire.

877
00:54:00,845 --> 00:54:05,647
When it had blazed up,
there on the tent wall was his shadow

878
00:54:05,647 --> 00:54:08,887
and that of the log where he sat with
his half-broken heart.

879
00:54:08,887 --> 00:54:13,086
And all the while I supposed he was
master of himself, and self-justified

880
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:16,388
against Steve’s omission
to bid him goodbye.

881
00:54:16,388 --> 00:54:20,860
I must have fallen asleep before he
returned, for I remember nothing except

882
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,860
waking and finding him in
his blankets beside me.

883
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:27,140
The fire shadow was gone,
and gray, cold light was

884
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,493
dimly on the tent.

885
00:54:28,493 --> 00:54:34,553
He slept restlessly, and his forehead was
ploughed by lines of pain.

886
00:54:34,553 --> 00:54:40,087
While I looked at him he began to mutter,
and suddenly started up with violence.

887
00:54:40,087 --> 00:54:40,740
“No!”

888
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,788
he cried out; “no!

889
00:54:42,788 --> 00:54:44,028
Just the same!”

890
00:54:44,028 --> 00:54:46,801
and thus wakened himself, staring.

891
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:48,045
“What’s the matter?”

892
00:54:48,045 --> 00:54:48,820
he demanded.

893
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:54,814
He was slow in getting back to where we
were; and full consciousness found him

894
00:54:54,814 --> 00:54:57,515
sitting up with his eyes fixed on mine.

895
00:54:57,515 --> 00:55:01,405
They were more haunted than they had been
at all, and his next speech came

896
00:55:01,405 --> 00:55:02,811
straight from his dream.

897
00:55:02,811 --> 00:55:04,711
“Maybe you’d better quit me.

898
00:55:04,711 --> 00:55:06,085
This ain’t your trouble.”

899
00:55:06,085 --> 00:55:06,940
I laughed.

900
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,782
“Why, what is the trouble?”

901
00:55:08,782 --> 00:55:12,591
His eyes still intently fixed on mine.

902
00:55:12,591 --> 00:55:16,508
“Do you think if we changed our trail we
could lose them from us?”

903
00:55:16,508 --> 00:55:20,484
I was framing a jocose reply about Ounces
being a good walker,

904
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:23,719
when the sound of hoofs rushing in the
distance stopped me,

905
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:26,084
and he ran out of the
tent with his rifle.

906
00:55:26,084 --> 00:55:29,997
When I followed with mine he was up the
bank, and all his powers alert.

907
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:34,847
But nothing came out of the dimness save
our three stampeded horses.

908
00:55:34,847 --> 00:55:39,481
They crashed over fallen timber and
across the open to where their picketed

909
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:41,674
comrade grazed at the end of his rope.

910
00:55:41,674 --> 00:55:46,204
By him they came to a stand,
and told him, I suppose,

911
00:55:46,204 --> 00:55:51,000
what they had seen; for all four now
faced in the same direction,

912
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,995
looking away into the mysterious dawn.

913
00:55:53,995 --> 00:55:57,912
We likewise stood peering,
and my rifle barrel felt cold in my

914
00:55:57,912 --> 00:55:58,730
hand.

915
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,779
The dawn was all we saw,
the inscrutable dawn,

916
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:08,191
coming and coming through the black
pines and the gray open of the basin.

917
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:13,053
There above lifted the peaks,
no sun yet on them, and behind us our

918
00:56:13,053 --> 00:56:16,087
stream made a little tinkling.

919
00:56:16,087 --> 00:56:19,213
“A bear, I suppose,” said I, at length.

920
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:23,860
His strange look fixed me again,
and then his eyes went to the horses.

921
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:28,020
“They smell things we can’t smell,”
said he, very slowly.

922
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:31,499
“Will you prove to me they don’t see
things we can’t see?”

923
00:56:31,499 --> 00:56:35,548
A chill shot through me,
and I could not help a frightened glance

924
00:56:35,548 --> 00:56:36,668
where we had been watching.

925
00:56:36,668 --> 00:56:41,074
But one of the horses began to graze and
I had a wholesome thought.

926
00:56:41,074 --> 00:56:44,740
“He’s tired of whatever he sees,
then,” said I, pointing.

927
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:48,354
A smile came for a moment
in the Virginian’s face.

928
00:56:48,354 --> 00:56:51,061
“Must be a poor show,” he observed.

929
00:56:51,061 --> 00:56:54,101
All the horses were grazing now,
and he added, “It ain’t

930
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:56,315
hurt their appetites any.”

931
00:56:56,315 --> 00:56:57,954
We made our own breakfast then.

932
00:56:57,954 --> 00:57:02,914
And what uncanny dread I may have been
touched with up to this time henceforth

933
00:57:02,914 --> 00:57:05,560
left me in the face of a real alarm.

934
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,832
The shock of Steve was
working upon the Virginian.

935
00:57:08,832 --> 00:57:12,594
He was aware of it himself;
he was fighting it with all his might;

936
00:57:12,594 --> 00:57:14,135
and he was being overcome.

937
00:57:14,135 --> 00:57:17,554
He was indeed like a gallant swimmer
against whom both wind

938
00:57:17,554 --> 00:57:19,446
and tide have conspired.

939
00:57:19,446 --> 00:57:24,552
And in this now foreboding solitude there
was only myself to throw him ropes.

940
00:57:24,552 --> 00:57:28,024
His strokes for safety were as bold as
was the undertow that

941
00:57:28,024 --> 00:57:29,584
ceaselessly annulled them.

942
00:57:29,584 --> 00:57:32,114
“I reckon I made a fuss in the tent?”

943
00:57:32,114 --> 00:57:34,857
said he, feeling his way with me.

944
00:57:34,857 --> 00:57:35,942
I threw him a rope.

945
00:57:35,942 --> 00:57:36,772
“Yes.

946
00:57:36,772 --> -1:59:59,000
Nightmare⁠—indigestion⁠—too
much newspaper before retiring.

947
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

948
00:57:41,277 --> 00:57:42,667
He caught the rope.

949
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,189
“That’s correct!

950
00:57:44,189 --> 00:57:46,948
I had a hell of a foolish dream for
a growed-up man.

951
00:57:46,948 --> 00:57:48,520
You’d not think it of me.”

952
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,412
“Oh, yes, I should.

953
00:57:51,412 --> 00:57:56,223
I’ve had them after prolonged
lobster and champagne.”

954
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,306
“Ah,” he murmured, “prolonged!

955
00:57:59,306 --> 00:58:01,222
Prolonged is what does it.”

956
00:58:01,222 --> 00:58:02,739
He glanced behind him.

957
00:58:02,739 --> 00:58:04,007
“Steve came back⁠—”

958
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:06,258
“In your lobster dream,” I put in.

959
00:58:06,258 --> 00:58:08,816
But he missed this rope.

960
00:58:08,816 --> 00:58:12,721
“Yes,” he answered, with
his eyes searching me.

961
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:14,140
“And he handed me the paper⁠—”

962
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,215
“By the way, where is that?”

963
00:58:16,215 --> 00:58:16,950
I asked.

964
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,708
“I built the fire with it.

965
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:23,656
But when I took it from him it was a six-
shooter I had hold of,

966
00:58:23,656 --> 00:58:25,389
and pointing at my breast.

967
00:58:25,389 --> 00:58:27,599
And then Steve spoke.

968
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,044
‘Do you think you’re fit to live?’

969
00:58:29,044 --> 00:58:32,720
Steve said; and I got hot at him,
and I reckon I must have told him what

970
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,320
I thought of him.

971
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,080
You heard me, I expect?”

972
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,114
“Glad I didn’t.

973
00:58:36,114 --> 00:58:38,203
Your language sometimes is⁠—”

974
00:58:38,203 --> 00:58:39,093
He laughed out.

975
00:58:39,093 --> 00:58:42,690
“Oh, I account for all this that’s
happening just like you do.

976
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:46,852
If we gave our explanations,
they’d be pretty near twins.”

977
00:58:46,852 --> 00:58:49,572
“The horses saw a bear, then?”

978
00:58:49,572 --> 00:58:50,371
“Maybe a bear.

979
00:58:50,371 --> -1:59:59,000
Maybe”⁠—but here the tide caught him
again⁠—“What’s your idea about dreams?

980
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

981
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:57,054
My ropes were all out.

982
00:58:57,054 --> 00:59:01,937
“Liver⁠—nerves,” was the best I could do.

983
00:59:01,937 --> 00:59:05,313
But now he swam strongly by himself.

984
00:59:05,313 --> 00:59:10,239
“You may think I’m discreditable,”
he said, “but I know I am.

985
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:15,243
It ought to take more than⁠—well,
men have lost their friendships before.

986
00:59:15,243 --> 00:59:19,265
Feuds and wars have cloven a right smart
of bonds in twain.

987
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:22,995
And if my haid is going to get shook by a
little old piece of newspaper⁠—I’m

988
00:59:22,995 --> 00:59:24,448
ashamed I burned that.

989
00:59:24,448 --> -1:59:59,000
I’m ashamed to have been that weak.

990
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

991
00:59:26,555 --> 00:59:29,515
“Any man gets unstrung,” I told him.

992
00:59:29,515 --> 00:59:34,580
My ropes had become straws;
and I strove to frame some policy

993
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,779
for the next hours.

994
00:59:35,779 --> 00:59:40,584
We now finished breakfast and set forth
to catch the horses.

995
00:59:40,584 --> 00:59:46,510
As we drove them in I found that the
Virginian was telling me a ghost story.

996
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:51,207
“At half-past three in the morning she
saw her runaway daughter standing with a

997
00:59:51,207 --> 00:59:54,798
babe in her arms; but when she moved
it was all gone.

998
00:59:54,798 --> 01:00:01,010
Later they found it was the very same
hour the young mother died in Nogales.

999
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:04,313
And she sent for the child
and raised it herself.

1000
01:00:04,313 --> 01:00:06,286
I knowed them both back home.

1001
01:00:06,286 --> 01:00:07,533
Do you believe that?”

1002
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:08,530
I said nothing.

1003
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:11,311
“No more do I believe it,” he asserted.

1004
01:00:11,311 --> 01:00:12,412
“And see here!

1005
01:00:12,412 --> 01:00:15,900
Nogales time is three
hours different from Richmond.

1006
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,175
I didn’t know about that point then.”

1007
01:00:18,175 --> 01:00:21,568
Once out of these mountains,
I knew he could right himself;

1008
01:00:21,568 --> 01:00:27,280
but even I, who had no Steve to dream
about, felt this silence of the peaks

1009
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,780
was preying on me.

1010
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:31,900
“Her daughter and her might have been
thinkin’ mighty hard about each other

1011
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,056
just then,” he pursued.

1012
01:00:34,056 --> 01:00:35,794
“But Steve is dead.

1013
01:00:35,794 --> 01:00:37,128
Finished.

1014
01:00:37,128 --> 01:00:39,213
You cert’nly don’t believe
there’s anything more?”

1015
01:00:39,213 --> 01:00:41,634
“I wish I could,” I told him.

1016
01:00:41,634 --> 01:00:43,440
“No, I’m satisfied.

1017
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,706
Heaven didn’t never interest me much.

1018
01:00:45,706 --> 01:00:49,466
But if there was a world of dreams after
you went⁠—” He stopped himself and

1019
01:00:49,466 --> 01:00:51,597
turned his searching eyes away from
mine.

1020
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:56,058
“There’s a heap o’ darkness wherever you
try to step,” he said,

1021
01:00:56,058 --> 01:00:59,880
“and I thought I’d left off wasting
thoughts on the subject.

1022
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:05,664
You see”⁠—he dexterously roped a horse,
and once more his splendid sanity was

1023
01:01:05,664 --> 01:01:10,741
turned to gold by his imagination⁠—“I
expect in many growed-up men you’d call

1024
01:01:10,741 --> 01:01:16,381
sensible there’s a little boy sleepin’
⁠—the little kid they onced was⁠—that

1025
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,021
still keeps his fear of the dark.

1026
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:21,166
You mentioned the dark yourself yesterday.

1027
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:26,031
Well, this experience has woke up that
kid in me, and blamed if I can coax the

1028
01:01:26,031 --> 01:01:28,815
little cuss to go to sleep again!

1029
01:01:28,815 --> 01:01:33,175
I keep a-telling him daylight will sure
come, but he keeps a-crying and

1030
01:01:33,175 --> -1:59:59,000
holding on to me.

1031
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1032
01:01:34,376 --> 01:01:39,690
Somewhere far in the basin there was a
faint sound, and we stood still.

1033
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:40,757
“Hush!”

1034
01:01:40,757 --> 01:01:42,170
he said.

1035
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:46,958
But it was like our watching the
dawn; nothing more followed.

1036
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:50,350
“They have shot that bear,” I remarked.

1037
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:53,921
He did not answer, and we put the
saddles on without talk.

1038
01:01:53,921 --> 01:01:58,026
We made no haste, but we were not over
half an hour, I suppose,

1039
01:01:58,026 --> 01:01:59,966
in getting off with the packs.

1040
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:03,791
It was not a new thing to hear a shot
where wild game was in plenty;

1041
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:09,400
yet as we rode that shot sounded already
in my mind different from others.

1042
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:13,315
Perhaps I should not believe this today
but for what I look back to.

1043
01:02:13,315 --> 01:02:18,271
To make camp last night we had turned off
the trail, and now followed the stream

1044
01:02:18,271 --> 01:02:23,531
down for a while, taking next a
cut through the wood.

1045
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:28,223
In this way we came upon the tracks of
our horses where they had been galloping

1046
01:02:28,223 --> 01:02:32,662
back to the camp after their fright.

1047
01:02:32,662 --> 01:02:39,827
They had kicked up the damp and matted
pine needles very plainly all along.

1048
01:02:39,827 --> 01:02:44,047
“Nothing has been here but
themselves, though,” said I.

1049
01:02:44,047 --> 01:02:47,320
“And they ain’t showing signs of
remembering any scare,”

1050
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,420
said the Virginian.

1051
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:51,297
In a little while we emerged upon an open.

1052
01:02:51,297 --> 01:02:56,693
“Here’s where they was grazing,”
said the Virginian; and the

1053
01:02:56,693 --> 01:02:58,624
signs were clear enough.

1054
01:02:58,624 --> 01:03:01,973
“Here’s where they must have got
their scare,” he pursued.

1055
01:03:01,973 --> 01:03:05,651
“You stay with them while
I circle a little.”

1056
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:11,244
So I stayed; and certainly our animals
were very calm at visiting this scene.

1057
01:03:11,244 --> 01:03:15,858
When you bring a horse back to where he
has recently encountered a wild animal

1058
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:19,140
his ears and his nostrils are apt
to be wide awake.

1059
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,396
The Virginian had stopped and
was beckoning to me.

1060
01:03:22,396 --> 01:03:26,324
“Here’s your bear,” said he, as I arrived.

1061
01:03:26,324 --> 01:03:28,150
“Two-legged, you see.

1062
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:29,963
And he had a hawss of his own.”

1063
01:03:29,963 --> 01:03:34,863
There was a stake driven down where an
animal had been picketed for the night.

1064
01:03:34,863 --> 01:03:40,253
“Looks like Ounces,” I
said, considering the footprints.

1065
01:03:40,253 --> 01:03:41,819
“It’s Ounces.

1066
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:45,972
And Ounces wanted another hawss very bad,
so him and Pounds could

1067
01:03:45,972 --> -1:59:59,000
travel like gentlemen should.

1068
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1069
01:03:47,771 --> 01:03:51,273
“But Pounds doesn’t seem to
have been with him.”

1070
01:03:51,273 --> 01:03:57,552
“Oh, Pounds, he was making coffee,
somewheres in yonder, when this

1071
01:03:57,552 --> 01:03:58,112
happened.

1072
01:03:58,112 --> 01:04:02,383
Neither of them guessed there’d be other
hawsses wandering here in the night,

1073
01:04:02,383 --> 01:04:03,861
or they both would have come.”

1074
01:04:03,861 --> 01:04:06,069
He turned back to our pack animals.

1075
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:08,757
“Then you’ll not hunt for this
camp to make sure?”

1076
01:04:08,757 --> 01:04:10,478
“I prefer making sure first.

1077
01:04:10,478 --> 01:04:12,809
We might be expected at that camp.”

1078
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:16,226
He took out his rifle from beneath his
leg and set it across his

1079
01:04:16,226 --> 01:04:17,506
saddle at half-cock.

1080
01:04:17,506 --> 01:04:21,466
I did the same; and thus cautiously we
resumed our journey in

1081
01:04:21,466 --> 01:04:23,480
a slightly different direction.

1082
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,359
“This ain’t all we’re going to find
out,” said the Virginian.

1083
01:04:26,359 --> 01:04:30,187
“Ounces had a good idea;
but I reckon he made a bad mistake

1084
01:04:30,187 --> -1:59:59,000
later.

1085
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1086
01:04:31,296 --> 01:04:34,679
We had found out a good deal without
any more, I thought.

1087
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:38,949
Ounces had gone to bring in their single
horse, and coming upon three more in the

1088
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:43,709
pasture had undertaken to catch one and
failed, merely driving them where

1089
01:04:43,709 --> 01:04:44,698
he feared to follow.

1090
01:04:44,698 --> 01:04:49,020
“Shorty never could rope a
horse alone,” I remarked.

1091
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,665
The Virginian grinned.

1092
01:04:50,665 --> 01:04:51,385
“Shorty?

1093
01:04:51,385 --> 01:04:54,795
Well, Shorty sounds as well as Ounces.

1094
01:04:54,795 --> -1:59:59,000
But that ain’t the mistake
I’m thinking he made.

1095
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1096
01:04:57,342 --> 01:05:00,430
I knew that he would not tell me,
but that was just like him.

1097
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:03,589
For the last twenty minutes,
having something to do,

1098
01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:07,449
he had become himself again,
had come to earth from that unsafe

1099
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:11,711
country of the brain where
beckoned a spectral Steve.

1100
01:05:11,711 --> 01:05:16,392
Nothing was left but in his eyes that
question which pain had set there;

1101
01:05:16,392 --> 01:05:21,191
and I wondered if his friend of old,
who seemed so brave and amiable,

1102
01:05:21,191 --> 01:05:25,071
would have dealt him that hurt at the
solemn end had he known what a poisoned

1103
01:05:25,071 --> 01:05:26,292
wound it would be.

1104
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:29,226
We came out on a ridge from which
we could look down.

1105
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:32,802
“You always want to ride on high places
when there’s folks around whose

1106
01:05:32,802 --> 01:05:35,882
intentions ain’t been
declared,” said the Virginian.

1107
01:05:35,882 --> 01:05:39,004
And we went along our
ridge for some distance.

1108
01:05:39,004 --> 01:05:45,110
Then, suddenly he turned down and guided
us almost at once to the trail.

1109
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:46,465
“That’s it,” he said.

1110
01:05:46,465 --> 01:05:47,092
“See.”

1111
01:05:47,092 --> 01:05:50,750
The track of a horse was very
fresh on the trail.

1112
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:54,910
But it was a galloping horse now,
and no bootprints were keeping up

1113
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:55,917
with it any more.

1114
01:05:55,917 --> 01:05:58,600
No boots could have kept up with it.

1115
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,200
The rider was making time today.

1116
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,769
Yesterday that horse had been ridden up
into the mountains at leisure.

1117
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:07,851
Who was on him?

1118
01:06:07,851 --> 01:06:10,210
There was never to be any
certain answer to that.

1119
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:12,506
But who was not on him?

1120
01:06:12,506 --> 01:06:16,789
We turned back in our journey,
back into the heart of that basin with

1121
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:22,012
the tall peaks all rising like teeth in
the cloudless sun, and

1122
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:24,636
the snowfields shining white.

1123
01:06:24,636 --> 01:06:27,602
“He was afraid of us,” said the Virginian.

1124
01:06:27,602 --> 01:06:30,609
“He did not know how many of us
had come up here.

1125
01:06:30,609 --> -1:59:59,000
Three hawsses might mean
a dozen more around.

1126
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1127
01:06:35,243 --> 01:06:39,288
We followed the backward trail in among
the pines, and came after a

1128
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:40,965
time upon their camp.

1129
01:06:40,965 --> 01:06:44,265
And then I understood the mistake
that Shorty had made.

1130
01:06:44,265 --> 01:06:48,578
He had returned after his failure,
and had told that other man of the

1131
01:06:48,578 --> 01:06:50,276
presence of new horses.

1132
01:06:50,276 --> 01:06:54,674
He should have kept this a secret;
for haste had to be made at once,

1133
01:06:54,674 --> 01:06:57,879
and two cannot get away
quickly upon one horse.

1134
01:06:57,879 --> 01:07:00,313
But it was poor Shorty’s last blunder.

1135
01:07:00,313 --> 01:07:06,222
He lay there by their extinct fire,
with his wistful, lost-dog face upward,

1136
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:10,202
and his thick yellow hair unparted as
it had always been.

1137
01:07:10,202 --> 01:07:12,833
The murder had been done from behind.

1138
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:14,575
We closed the eyes.

1139
01:07:14,575 --> 01:07:17,608
“There was no natural harm in
him,” said the Virginian.

1140
01:07:17,608 --> 01:07:20,252
“But you must do a thing
well in this country.”

1141
01:07:20,252 --> 01:07:24,186
There was not a trace,
not a clue, of the other man;

1142
01:07:24,186 --> 01:07:27,883
and we found a place where we could soon
cover Shorty with earth.

1143
01:07:27,883 --> 01:07:32,245
As we lifted him we saw the newspaper
that he had been reading.

1144
01:07:32,245 --> 01:07:37,298
He had brought it from the clump of
cottonwoods where he and the other man

1145
01:07:37,298 --> 01:07:43,257
had made a later visit than ours to be
sure of the fate of their friends⁠—or

1146
01:07:43,257 --> 01:07:46,249
possibly in hopes of another horse.

1147
01:07:46,249 --> 01:07:50,633
Evidently, when the party were surprised,
they had been able to

1148
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,395
escape with only one.

1149
01:07:52,395 --> 01:08:01,992
All of the newspaper was there save the
leaf I had picked up⁠—all and more,

1150
01:08:01,992 --> 01:08:07,684
for this had pencil writing on it that
was not mine, nor did I at

1151
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:08,796
first take it in.

1152
01:08:08,796 --> 01:08:12,414
I thought it might be a clue,
and I read it aloud.

1153
01:08:12,414 --> 01:08:14,655
“Goodbye, Jeff,” it said.

1154
01:08:14,655 --> 01:08:17,839
“I could not have spoke to you
without playing the baby.”

1155
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:18,935
“Who’s Jeff?”

1156
01:08:18,935 --> 01:08:20,078
I asked.

1157
01:08:20,078 --> 01:08:23,444
But it came over me when I
looked at the Virginian.

1158
01:08:23,444 --> 01:08:27,759
He was standing beside me quite
motionless; and then he put out his hand

1159
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,673
and took the paper, and stood still,
looking at the words.

1160
01:08:31,673 --> 01:08:36,436
“Steve used to call me Jeff,”
he said, “because I was Southern.

1161
01:08:36,436 --> 01:08:38,289
I reckon nobody else ever did.”

1162
01:08:38,289 --> 01:08:42,846
He slowly folded the message from the
dead, brought by the dead,

1163
01:08:42,846 --> 01:08:45,212
and rolled it in the
coat behind his saddle.

1164
01:08:45,212 --> 01:08:49,778
For a half-minute he stood leaning his
forehead down against the saddle.

1165
01:08:49,778 --> 01:08:53,822
After this he came back and
contemplated Shorty’s face awhile.

1166
01:08:53,822 --> 01:08:56,329
“I wish I could thank him,” he said.

1167
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:57,570
“I wish I could.”

1168
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:03,415
We carried Shorty over and covered him
with earth, and on that laid a few pine

1169
01:09:03,415 --> 01:09:08,175
branches; then we took up our journey,
and by the end of the forenoon we had

1170
01:09:08,175 --> 01:09:11,841
gone some distance upon our trail
through the Teton Mountains.

1171
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:17,775
But in front of us the hoofprints ever
held their stride of haste,

1172
01:09:17,775 --> 01:09:22,059
drawing farther from us through the
hours, until by the next afternoon

1173
01:09:22,059 --> 01:09:26,769
somewhere we noticed they were no longer
to be seen; and after that they never

1174
01:09:26,769 --> 01:09:28,180
came upon the trail again.

1175
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:29,568
CHAPTER XXXIII

1176
01:09:29,568 --> 01:09:32,088
The Spinster Loses Some Sleep

1177
01:09:32,088 --> 01:09:36,833
Somewhere at the eastern base of the
Tetons did those hoofprints disappear

1178
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:41,406
into a mountain sanctuary where many
crooked paths have led.

1179
01:09:41,406 --> 01:09:45,994
He that took another man’s possessions,
or he that took another man’s life,

1180
01:09:45,994 --> 01:09:51,232
could always run here if the law or
popular justice were too

1181
01:09:51,232 --> 01:09:52,423
hot at his heels.

1182
01:09:52,423 --> 01:09:57,381
Steep ranges and forests walled him in
from the world on all four sides,

1183
01:09:57,381 --> 01:10:00,559
almost without a break;
and every entrance lay

1184
01:10:00,559 --> 01:10:02,475
through intricate solitudes.

1185
01:10:02,475 --> 01:10:06,973
Snake River came into the place through
canyons and mournful pines and marshes,

1186
01:10:06,973 --> 01:10:10,988
to the north, and went out at the
south between formidable chasms.

1187
01:10:10,988 --> 01:10:14,983
Every tributary to this stream rose among
high peaks and ridges,

1188
01:10:14,983 --> 01:10:18,749
and descended into the valley by well-
nigh impenetrable courses:

1189
01:10:18,749 --> 01:10:24,598
Pacific Creek from Two Ocean Pass,
Buffalo Fork from no pass at all,

1190
01:10:24,598 --> 01:10:30,357
Black Rock from the To-wo-ge-tee Pass⁠—
all these, and many more,

1191
01:10:30,357 --> 01:10:35,580
were the waters of loneliness,
among whose thousand hiding-places it

1192
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,380
was easy to be lost.

1193
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:41,260
Down in the bottom was a spread of level
land, broad and beautiful,

1194
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:46,618
with the blue and silver Tetons rising
from its chain of lakes to the west,

1195
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:50,423
and other heights presiding
over its other sides.

1196
01:10:50,423 --> 01:10:54,186
And up and down and in and out of this
hollow square of mountains,

1197
01:10:54,186 --> 01:10:59,326
where waters plentifully flowed,
and game and natural pasture abounded,

1198
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:02,801
there skulked a nomadic
and distrustful population.

1199
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:07,021
This in due time built cabins,
took wives, begot children,

1200
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:11,259
and came to speak of itself as “The
honest settlers of Jackson’s Hole.”

1201
01:11:11,259 --> 01:11:15,780
It is a commodious title,
and doubtless today more accurate

1202
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,174
than it was once.

1203
01:11:17,174 --> 01:11:20,390
Into this place the hoofprints
disappeared.

1204
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:26,247
Not many cabins were yet built there;
but the unknown rider of the horse knew

1205
01:11:26,247 --> 01:11:32,061
well that he would find shelter and
welcome among the felons of his stripe.

1206
01:11:32,061 --> 01:11:36,786
Law and order might guess his name
correctly, but there was no next step,

1207
01:11:36,786 --> 01:11:40,351
for lack of evidence;
and he would wait, whoever he was,

1208
01:11:40,351 --> 01:11:44,832
until the rage of popular justice,
which had been pursuing him and his

1209
01:11:44,832 --> 01:11:46,642
brother thieves, should subside.

1210
01:11:46,642 --> 01:11:51,338
Then, feeling his way gradually with
prudence, he would let

1211
01:11:51,338 --> 01:11:52,786
himself be seen again.

1212
01:11:52,786 --> 01:11:58,612
And now, as mysteriously as he had melted
away, rumor passed over the country.

1213
01:11:58,612 --> 01:12:03,750
No tongue seemed to be heard telling the
first news; the news was there,

1214
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:07,685
one day, a matter of whispered
knowledge.

1215
01:12:07,685 --> 01:12:13,386
On Sunk Creek and on Bear Creek,
and elsewhere far and wide,

1216
01:12:13,386 --> 01:12:18,338
before men talked men seemed secretly to
know that Steve, and Ed,

1217
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:20,699
and Shorty, would never again be seen.

1218
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:24,517
Riders met each other in the road and
drew rein to discuss the event,

1219
01:12:24,517 --> 01:12:27,149
and its bearing upon
the cattle interests.

1220
01:12:27,149 --> 01:12:34,205
In town saloons men took each other
aside, and muttered over it in corners.

1221
01:12:34,205 --> 01:12:38,946
Thus it reached the ears of Molly Wood,
beginning in a veiled and harmless

1222
01:12:38,946 --> 01:12:39,497
shape.

1223
01:12:39,497 --> 01:12:42,816
A neighbor joined her when she was
out riding by herself.

1224
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:44,334
“Good morning,” said he.

1225
01:12:44,334 --> 01:12:45,911
“Don’t you find it lonesome?”

1226
01:12:45,911 --> 01:12:49,384
And when she answered lightly,
he continued, meaning well:

1227
01:12:49,384 --> 01:12:52,209
“You’ll be having company again soon
now.

1228
01:12:52,209 --> 01:12:56,781
He has finished his job.

1229
01:12:56,781 --> 01:12:58,614
Wish he’d finished it more!

1230
01:12:58,614 --> 01:12:59,908
Well, good day.”

1231
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:02,414
Molly thought these words over.

1232
01:13:02,414 --> 01:13:06,111
She could not tell why they gave
her a strange feeling.

1233
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:11,131
To her Vermont mind no suspicion of the
truth would come naturally.

1234
01:13:11,131 --> 01:13:15,390
But suspicion began to come when she
returned from her ride.

1235
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:20,346
For, entering the cabin of the Taylors’,
she came upon several people who all

1236
01:13:20,346 --> 01:13:24,480
dropped their talk short,
and were not skilful at resuming it.

1237
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,226
She sat there awhile,
uneasily aware that all of them knew

1238
01:13:28,226 --> 01:13:32,354
something which she did not know,
and was not intended to know.

1239
01:13:32,354 --> 01:13:36,334
A thought pierced her⁠—had anything
happened to her lover?

1240
01:13:36,334 --> 01:13:40,386
No; that was not it.

1241
01:13:40,386 --> 01:13:52,429
The man she had met on horseback spoke of
her having company soon again.

1242
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:53,703
How soon?

1243
01:13:53,703 --> 01:13:54,569
she wondered.

1244
01:13:54,569 --> 01:13:59,172
He had been unable to say when he should
return, and now she suddenly felt that a

1245
01:13:59,172 --> 01:14:04,360
great silence had enveloped him lately:
not the mere silence of absence,

1246
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:10,305
of receiving no messages or letters,
but another sort of silence which now,

1247
01:14:10,305 --> 01:14:15,808
at this moment, was weighing
strangely upon her.

1248
01:14:15,808 --> 01:14:21,219
And then the next day it came
out at the schoolhouse.

1249
01:14:21,219 --> 01:14:25,780
During that interval known as recess,
she became aware through the open window

1250
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:28,020
that they were playing
a new game outside.

1251
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:31,070
Lusty screeches of delight
reached her ears.

1252
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:31,754
“Jump!”

1253
01:14:31,754 --> 01:14:33,000
a voice ordered.

1254
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,695
“Jump!”

1255
01:14:33,695 --> 01:14:37,432
“I don’t want to,” returned
another voice, uneasily.

1256
01:14:37,432 --> 01:14:39,758
“You said you would,” said several.

1257
01:14:39,758 --> 01:14:41,472
“Didn’t he say he would?

1258
01:14:41,472 --> 01:14:45,961
Ah, he said he would.

1259
01:14:45,961 --> 01:14:48,319
Jump now, quick!”

1260
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:52,959
“But I don’t want to,”
quavered the voice in a tone so dismal

1261
01:14:52,959 --> 01:14:54,766
that Molly went out to see.

1262
01:14:54,766 --> 01:14:59,610
They had got Bob Carmody on the top of
the gate by a tree, with a rope round

1263
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:05,130
his neck, the other end of which four
little boys were joyously holding.

1264
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:09,552
The rest looked on eagerly,
three little girls clasping their hands,

1265
01:15:09,552 --> 01:15:11,836
and springing up and
down with excitement.

1266
01:15:11,836 --> 01:15:13,775
“Why, children!”

1267
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:14,963
exclaimed Molly.

1268
01:15:14,963 --> 01:15:19,819
“He’s said his prayers and everything,”
they all screamed out.

1269
01:15:19,819 --> 01:15:22,986
“He’s a rustler, and we’re lynchin’ him.

1270
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:24,111
Jump, Bob!”

1271
01:15:24,111 --> 01:15:25,506
“I don’t want⁠—”

1272
01:15:25,506 --> 01:15:28,687
“Ah, coward, won’t take his medicine!”

1273
01:15:28,687 --> 01:15:31,719
“Let him go, boys,” said Molly.

1274
01:15:31,719 --> 01:15:32,819
“You might really hurt him.”

1275
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:36,342
And so she broke up this game,
but not without general protest

1276
01:15:36,342 --> 01:15:38,263
from Wyoming’s young voice.

1277
01:15:38,263 --> 01:15:41,623
“He said he would,” Henry Dow assured her.

1278
01:15:41,623 --> 01:15:45,607
And George Taylor further explained:
“He said he’d be Steve.

1279
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:47,823
But Steve didn’t scare.”

1280
01:15:47,823 --> 01:15:51,864
Then George proceeded to tell the
schoolmarm, eagerly,

1281
01:15:51,864 --> 01:15:56,098
all about Steve and Ed,
while the schoolmarm looked at him

1282
01:15:56,098 --> 01:15:57,338
with a rigid face.

1283
01:15:57,338 --> 01:16:01,019
“You promised your mother you’d not
tell,” said Henry Dow,

1284
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:02,619
after all had been told.

1285
01:16:02,619 --> 01:16:04,779
“You’ve gone and done it,”
and Henry wagged his head

1286
01:16:04,779 --> 01:16:06,135
in a superior manner.

1287
01:16:06,135 --> 01:16:10,594
Thus did the New England girl learn what
her cowboy lover had done.

1288
01:16:10,594 --> 01:16:14,165
She spoke of it to nobody;
she kept her misery to herself.

1289
01:16:14,165 --> 01:16:17,168
He was not there to defend his act.

1290
01:16:17,168 --> 01:16:19,972
Perhaps in a way that was better.

1291
01:16:19,972 --> 01:16:24,438
But these were hours of darkness
indeed to Molly Wood.

1292
01:16:24,438 --> 01:16:28,558
On that visit to Dunbarton,
when at the first sight of her lover’s

1293
01:16:28,558 --> 01:16:35,492
photograph in frontier dress her aunt
had exclaimed, “I suppose there are days

1294
01:16:35,492 --> 01:16:40,251
when he does not kill people,”
she had cried in all good faith and

1295
01:16:40,251 --> 01:16:43,090
mirth, “He never killed anybody!”

1296
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:47,524
Later, when he was lying in her cabin
weak from his bullet wound,

1297
01:16:47,524 --> 01:16:51,741
but each day stronger beneath her
nursing, at a certain word of his there

1298
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:54,727
had gone through her a shudder of doubt.

1299
01:16:54,727 --> 01:16:59,674
Perhaps in his many wanderings he had
done such a thing in self-defence,

1300
01:16:59,674 --> 01:17:01,627
or in the cause of popular justice.

1301
01:17:01,627 --> 01:17:06,114
But she had pushed the idea away from her
hastily, back into the days before she

1302
01:17:06,114 --> 01:17:07,314
had ever seen him.

1303
01:17:07,314 --> 01:17:11,205
If this had ever happened,
let her not know of it.

1304
01:17:11,205 --> 01:17:15,418
Then, as a cruel reward for his candor
and his laying himself bare to her

1305
01:17:15,418 --> 01:17:20,011
mother, the letters from Bennington had
used that very letter of his as

1306
01:17:20,011 --> 01:17:21,281
a weapon against him.

1307
01:17:21,281 --> 01:17:23,923
Her sister Sarah had quoted from it.

1308
01:17:23,923 --> 01:17:29,059
“He says with apparent pride,”
wrote Sarah, “that he has never killed

1309
01:17:29,059 --> 01:17:31,782
for pleasure or profit.’

1310
01:17:31,782 --> 01:17:34,843
Those are his exact words,
and you may guess their

1311
01:17:34,843 --> 01:17:36,549
dreadful effect upon mother.

1312
01:17:36,549 --> 01:17:39,963
I congratulate you, my dear,
on having chosen a protector

1313
01:17:39,963 --> -1:59:59,000
so scrupulous.

1314
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1315
01:17:41,126 --> 01:17:45,274
Thus her elder sister had seen fit to
write; and letters from less near

1316
01:17:45,274 --> 01:17:47,901
relatives made hints at the same
subject.

1317
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:52,354
So she was compelled to accept this piece
of knowledge thrust upon her.

1318
01:17:52,354 --> 01:17:57,300
Yet still, still, those events had been
before she knew him.

1319
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:00,556
They were remote, without
detail or context.

1320
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:02,687
He had been little more than a boy.

1321
01:18:02,687 --> 01:18:05,127
No doubt it was to save his own life.

1322
01:18:05,127 --> 01:18:10,087
And so she bore the hurt of her discovery
all the more easily because her sister’s

1323
01:18:10,087 --> 01:18:13,350
tone roused her to defend her cowboy.

1324
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:14,418
But now!

1325
01:18:14,418 --> 01:18:21,186
In her cabin, alone, after midnight,
she arose from her sleepless bed,

1326
01:18:21,186 --> 01:18:26,095
and lighting the candle,
stood before his photograph.

1327
01:18:26,095 --> 01:18:31,286
“It is a good face,” her great-aunt had
said, after some study of it.

1328
01:18:31,286 --> 01:18:34,054
And these words were in her mind now.

1329
01:18:34,054 --> 01:18:40,388
There his likeness stood at full length,
confronting her: the spurs on the boots,

1330
01:18:40,388 --> 01:18:44,881
the fringed leathern chaparreros,
the coiled rope in hand,

1331
01:18:44,881 --> 01:18:50,076
the pistol at hip, the rough flannel
shirt, and the scarf knotted at the

1332
01:18:50,076 --> 01:18:54,114
throat⁠—and then the grave
eyes, looking at her.

1333
01:18:54,114 --> 01:18:57,604
It thrilled her to meet them, even so.

1334
01:18:57,604 --> 01:18:59,391
She could read life into them.

1335
01:18:59,391 --> 01:19:03,208
She seemed to feel passion come from
them, and then something like reproach.

1336
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:07,868
She stood for a long while looking at
him, and then, beating her hands

1337
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:13,548
together suddenly, she blew out her
light and went back into bed,

1338
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:16,394
but not to sleep.

1339
01:19:16,394 --> 01:19:20,502
“You’re looking pale,
deary,” said Mrs. Taylor to her,

1340
01:19:20,502 --> 01:19:21,782
a few days later.

1341
01:19:21,782 --> 01:19:22,742
“Am I?”

1342
01:19:22,742 --> 01:19:24,854
“And you don’t eat anything.”

1343
01:19:24,854 --> 01:19:26,247
“Oh, yes, I do.”

1344
01:19:26,247 --> 01:19:27,942
And Molly retired to her cabin.

1345
01:19:27,942 --> -1:59:59,000
“George,” said Mrs. Taylor,
“you come here.

1346
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1347
01:19:31,064 --> 01:19:34,627
It may seem severe⁠—I think
that it was severe.

1348
01:19:34,627 --> 01:19:38,384
That evening when Mr. Taylor came home to
his family, George received

1349
01:19:38,384 --> 01:19:40,675
a thrashing for disobedience.

1350
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:44,875
“And I suppose,” said Mrs. Taylor to her
husband, “that she came out just in time

1351
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:47,866
to stop ’em breaking Bob
Carmody’s neck for him.”

1352
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:51,617
Upon the day following Mrs.
Taylor essayed the impossible.

1353
01:19:51,617 --> 01:19:54,534
She took herself over
to Molly Wood’s cabin.

1354
01:19:54,534 --> 01:19:58,435
The girl gave her a listless greeting,
and the dame sat slowly down,

1355
01:19:58,435 --> 01:20:00,115
and surveyed the comfortable room.

1356
01:20:00,115 --> 01:20:04,770
“A very nice home, deary,”
said she, “if it was a home.

1357
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:08,470
But you’ll fix something like this in
your real home, I have no doubt.”

1358
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,043
Molly made no answer.

1359
01:20:10,043 --> 01:20:14,114
“What we’re going to do without you I
can’t see,” said Mrs. Taylor.

1360
01:20:14,114 --> 01:20:16,918
“But I’d not have it different for worlds.

1361
01:20:16,918 --> 01:20:19,466
He’ll be coming back soon, I expect.”

1362
01:20:19,466 --> 01:20:20,118
“Mrs.

1363
01:20:20,118 --> 01:20:24,973
Taylor,” said Molly, all at once,
“please don’t say anything now.

1364
01:20:24,973 --> 01:20:26,553
I can’t stand it.”

1365
01:20:26,553 --> 01:20:28,951
And she broke into wretched tears.

1366
01:20:28,951 --> 01:20:31,173
“Why, deary, he⁠—”

1367
01:20:31,173 --> 01:20:32,658
“No; not a word.

1368
01:20:32,658 --> 01:20:35,775
Please, please⁠—I’ll go out if you do.”

1369
01:20:35,775 --> 01:20:39,566
The older woman went to the younger one,
and then put her arms round her.

1370
01:20:39,566 --> 01:20:42,981
But when the tears were over,
they had not done any good;

1371
01:20:42,981 --> 01:20:48,824
it was not the storm that clears the
sky⁠—all storms do not clear the sky.

1372
01:20:48,824 --> 01:20:52,995
And Mrs. Taylor looked at the pale girl
and saw that she could do nothing to

1373
01:20:52,995 --> 01:20:55,577
help her toward peace of mind.

1374
01:20:55,577 --> 01:21:00,368
“Of course,” she said to her husband,
after returning from her profitless

1375
01:21:00,368 --> 01:21:02,852
errand, “you might know
she’d feel dreadful.

1376
01:21:02,852 --> 01:21:03,689
“What about?”

1377
01:21:03,689 --> 01:21:04,645
said Taylor.

1378
01:21:04,645 --> 01:21:11,716
“Why, you know just as well as I do.

1379
01:21:11,716 --> 01:21:15,196
And I’ll say for myself,
I hope you’ll never have

1380
01:21:15,196 --> 01:21:17,561
to help hang folks.”

1381
01:21:17,561 --> 01:21:23,251
“Well,” said Taylor, mildly,
“if I had to, I’d have to, I guess.”

1382
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:26,385
“Well, I don’t want it to come.

1383
01:21:26,385 --> 01:21:30,841
But that poor girl is eating her heart
right out over it.”

1384
01:21:30,841 --> 01:21:31,861
“What does she say?”

1385
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:33,411
“It’s what she don’t say.

1386
01:21:33,411 --> 01:21:37,952
She’ll not talk, and she’ll not let me
talk, and she sits and sits.”

1387
01:21:37,952 --> 01:21:40,707
“I’ll go talk some to her,” said the man.

1388
01:21:40,707 --> 01:21:43,452
“Well, Taylor, I thought
you had more sense.

1389
01:21:43,452 --> 01:21:45,303
You’d not get a word in.

1390
01:21:45,303 --> 01:21:48,505
She’ll be sick soon if her worry
ain’t stopped someway, though.”

1391
01:21:48,505 --> 01:21:51,049
“What does she want this country to do?”

1392
01:21:51,049 --> 01:21:52,085
inquired Taylor.

1393
01:21:52,085 --> 01:21:55,167
“Does she expect it to be
like Vermont when it⁠—”

1394
01:21:55,167 --> 01:21:59,091
“We can’t help what she
expects,” his wife interrupted.

1395
01:21:59,091 --> 01:22:00,673
“But I wish we could help her.”

1396
01:22:00,673 --> 01:22:04,118
They could not, however;
and help came from another source.

1397
01:22:04,118 --> 01:22:07,738
Judge Henry rode by the next day.

1398
01:22:07,738 --> 01:22:12,691
To him good Mrs. Taylor at
once confided her anxiety.

1399
01:22:12,691 --> 01:22:14,524
The Judge looked grave.

1400
01:22:14,524 --> 01:22:16,383
“Must I meddle?”

1401
01:22:16,383 --> 01:22:16,967
he said.

1402
01:22:16,967 --> 01:22:20,334
“Yes, Judge, you must,” said Mrs. Taylor.

1403
01:22:20,334 --> 01:22:23,730
“But why can’t I send him over here
when he gets back?

1404
01:22:23,730 --> -1:59:59,000
Then they’ll just settle
it between themselves.

1405
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1406
01:22:27,392 --> 01:22:27,785
Mrs.

1407
01:22:27,785 --> 01:22:29,145
Taylor shook her head.

1408
01:22:29,145 --> 01:22:32,645
“That would unsettle it worse than it
is,” she assured him.

1409
01:22:32,645 --> 01:22:34,325
“They mustn’t meet just now.”

1410
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:35,767
The Judge sighed.

1411
01:22:35,767 --> 01:22:38,774
“Well,” he said, “very well.

1412
01:22:38,774 --> 01:22:43,699
I’ll sacrifice my character,
since you insist.”

1413
01:22:43,699 --> 01:22:49,200
Judge Henry sat thinking,
waiting until school should be out.

1414
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,675
He did not at all relish
what lay before him.

1415
01:22:52,675 --> 01:22:54,032
He would like to have got out of it.

1416
01:22:54,032 --> 01:22:57,475
He had been a federal judge;
he had been an upright judge;

1417
01:22:57,475 --> 01:23:02,178
he had met the responsibilities of his
difficult office not only with learning,

1418
01:23:02,178 --> 01:23:06,986
which is desirable, but also with
courage and common sense besides,

1419
01:23:06,986 --> 01:23:09,544
and these are essential.

1420
01:23:09,544 --> 01:23:12,420
He had been a stanch servant of the law.

1421
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:16,712
And now he was invited to defend that
which, at first sight,

1422
01:23:16,712 --> 01:23:21,627
nay, even at second and third sight,
must always seem a defiance of the law

1423
01:23:21,627 --> 01:23:24,460
more injurious than crime itself.

1424
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:30,298
Every good man in this world has
convictions about right and wrong.

1425
01:23:30,298 --> 01:23:34,083
They are his soul’s riches,
his spiritual gold.

1426
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:39,506
When his conduct is at variance with
these, he knows that it is a departure,

1427
01:23:39,506 --> 01:23:44,289
a falling; and this is a
simple and clear matter.

1428
01:23:44,289 --> 01:23:48,889
If falling were all that ever happened to
a good man, all his days would be a

1429
01:23:48,889 --> 01:23:53,323
simple matter of striving and
repentance.

1430
01:23:53,323 --> 01:23:54,548
But it is not all.

1431
01:23:54,548 --> 01:24:01,038
There come to him certain junctures,
crises, when life, like a highwayman,

1432
01:24:01,038 --> 01:24:06,957
springs upon him, demanding that he
stand and deliver his convictions in the

1433
01:24:06,957 --> 01:24:12,285
name of some righteous cause,
bidding him do evil that good may come.

1434
01:24:12,285 --> 01:24:15,989
I cannot say that I believe in doing evil
that good may come.

1435
01:24:15,989 --> 01:24:17,391
I do not.

1436
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:22,515
I think that any man who honestly
justifies such course deceives himself.

1437
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:28,541
But this I can say: to call any act evil,
instantly begs the question.

1438
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:34,718
Many an act that man does is right or
wrong according to the time and place

1439
01:24:34,718 --> 01:24:39,371
which form, so to speak,
its context; strip it of its surrounding

1440
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:42,674
circumstances, and you
tear away its meaning.

1441
01:24:42,674 --> 01:24:46,964
Gentlemen reformers, beware of this
common practice of yours!

1442
01:24:46,964 --> 01:24:53,187
beware of calling an act evil on Tuesday
because that same act was evil on

1443
01:24:53,187 --> 01:24:53,936
Monday!

1444
01:24:53,936 --> 01:24:56,183
Do you fail to follow my meaning?

1445
01:24:56,183 --> 01:24:59,178
Then here is an illustration.

1446
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:02,468
On Monday I walk over my neighbor’s
field; there is no wrong in such

1447
01:25:02,468 --> 01:25:03,039
walking.

1448
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:08,276
By Tuesday he has put up a sign that
trespassers will be prosecuted

1449
01:25:08,276 --> 01:25:09,294
according to law.

1450
01:25:09,294 --> 01:25:12,444
I walk again on Tuesday,
and am a lawbreaker.

1451
01:25:12,444 --> 01:25:14,244
Do you begin to see my point?

1452
01:25:14,244 --> 01:25:18,202
or are you inclined to object to the
illustration because the walking on

1453
01:25:18,202 --> 01:25:21,887
Tuesday was not wrong,
but merely illegal?

1454
01:25:21,887 --> 01:25:25,446
Then here is another illustration which
you will find it a trifle

1455
01:25:25,446 --> 01:25:27,089
more embarrassing to answer.

1456
01:25:27,089 --> 01:25:31,517
Consider carefully, let me beg you,
the case of a young man and a young

1457
01:25:31,517 --> 01:25:36,877
woman who walk out of a door on Tuesday,
pronounced man and wife by a third

1458
01:25:36,877 --> 01:25:38,647
party inside the door.

1459
01:25:38,647 --> 01:25:43,883
It matters not that on Monday they were,
in their own hearts,

1460
01:25:43,883 --> 01:25:45,717
sacredly vowed to each other.

1461
01:25:45,717 --> 01:25:50,009
If they had omitted stepping inside that
door, if they had dispensed with that

1462
01:25:50,009 --> 01:25:54,643
third party, and gone away on Monday
sacredly vowed to each other in their

1463
01:25:54,643 --> 01:25:58,445
own hearts, you would have scarcely
found their conduct moral.

1464
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:04,157
Consider these things carefully⁠—the
signpost and the third party⁠—and

1465
01:26:04,157 --> 01:26:05,557
the difference they make.

1466
01:26:05,557 --> 01:26:09,496
And now, for a finish,
we will return to the signpost.

1467
01:26:09,496 --> 01:26:16,143
Suppose that I went over my neighbor’s
field on Tuesday, after the signpost was

1468
01:26:16,143 --> 01:26:20,686
put up, because I saw a murder about to
be committed in the field,

1469
01:26:20,686 --> 01:26:24,235
and therefore ran in and stopped it.

1470
01:26:24,235 --> 01:26:28,392
Was I doing evil that good might come?

1471
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:32,022
Do you not think that to stay out and let
the murder be done would have been the

1472
01:26:32,022 --> 01:26:34,394
evil act in this case?

1473
01:26:34,394 --> 01:26:38,713
To disobey the signpost was right;
and I trust that you now perceive the

1474
01:26:38,713 --> 01:26:43,835
same act may wear as many different hues
of right or wrong as the rainbow,

1475
01:26:43,835 --> 01:26:46,558
according to the atmosphere in
which it is done.

1476
01:26:46,558 --> 01:26:50,827
It is not safe to say of any man,
“He did evil that good might come.”

1477
01:26:50,827 --> 01:26:53,711
Was the thing that he did,
in the first place, evil?

1478
01:26:53,711 --> 01:26:55,404
That is the question.

1479
01:26:55,404 --> 01:26:59,119
Forgive my asking you to use your mind.

1480
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:02,723
It is a thing which no novelist should
expect of his reader,

1481
01:27:02,723 --> 01:27:07,439
and we will go back at once to Judge
Henry and his meditations about

1482
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:08,227
lynching.

1483
01:27:08,227 --> 01:27:11,875
He was well aware that if he was to touch
at all upon this subject with the New

1484
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:15,955
England girl, he could not put her off
with mere platitudes and humdrum

1485
01:27:15,955 --> 01:27:19,874
formulas; not, at least,
if he expected to do any good.

1486
01:27:19,874 --> 01:27:23,505
She was far too intelligent,
and he was really anxious to do good.

1487
01:27:23,505 --> 01:27:28,686
For her sake he wanted the course of the
girl’s true love to run more smoothly,

1488
01:27:28,686 --> 01:27:32,566
and still more did he desire this for
the sake of his Virginian.

1489
01:27:32,566 --> 01:27:37,170
“I sent him myself on that business,”
the Judge reflected uncomfortably.

1490
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:40,587
“I am partly responsible for the lynching.

1491
01:27:40,587 --> 01:27:48,543
It has brought him one great unhappiness
already through the death of Steve.

1492
01:27:48,543 --> 01:27:52,943
If it gets running in this girl’s mind,
she may⁠—dear me!”

1493
01:27:52,943 --> 01:27:56,437
the Judge broke off, “what a nuisance!”

1494
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:57,437
And he sighed.

1495
01:27:57,437 --> 01:28:02,466
For as all men know, he also knew that
many things should be done in this world

1496
01:28:02,466 --> 01:28:06,369
in silence, and that talking about
them is a mistake.

1497
01:28:06,369 --> 01:28:10,812
But when school was out,
and the girl gone to her cabin,

1498
01:28:10,812 --> 01:28:16,223
his mind had set the subject in order
thoroughly, and he knocked at her door,

1499
01:28:16,223 --> 01:28:20,598
ready, as he had put it,
to sacrifice his character in the

1500
01:28:20,598 --> 01:28:22,146
cause of true love.

1501
01:28:22,146 --> 01:28:26,989
“Well,” he said, coming straight to the
point, “some dark things have happened.”

1502
01:28:26,989 --> 01:28:30,349
And when she made no answer to this,
he continued: “But you

1503
01:28:30,349 --> 01:28:32,495
must not misunderstand us.

1504
01:28:32,495 --> 01:28:34,920
We’re too fond of you for that.”

1505
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:38,507
“Judge Henry,” said Molly Wood,
also coming straight to the point,

1506
01:28:38,507 --> 01:28:41,190
“have you come to tell me that you
think well of lynching?”

1507
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:42,727
He met her.

1508
01:28:42,727 --> 01:28:47,854
“Of burning Southern negroes
in public, no.

1509
01:28:47,854 --> 01:28:53,728
Of hanging Wyoming cattle
thieves in private, yes.

1510
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:55,819
You perceive there’s a
difference, don’t you?”

1511
01:28:55,819 --> 01:28:58,968
“Not in principle,” said the
girl, dry and short.

1512
01:28:58,968 --> 01:29:02,010
“Oh⁠—dear⁠—me!”

1513
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,531
slowly exclaimed the Judge.

1514
01:29:04,531 --> 01:29:08,737
“I am sorry that you cannot see that,
because I think that I can.

1515
01:29:08,737 --> 01:29:11,623
And I think that you have just as much
sense as I have.”

1516
01:29:11,623 --> 01:29:16,114
The Judge made himself very grave and
very good-humored at the same time.

1517
01:29:16,114 --> 01:29:20,540
The poor girl was strung to a high pitch,
and spoke harshly in spite of herself.

1518
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:22,505
“What is the difference in principle?”

1519
01:29:22,505 --> 01:29:23,844
she demanded.

1520
01:29:23,844 --> 01:29:27,291
“Well,” said the Judge,
easy and thoughtful,

1521
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:28,837
“what do you mean by principle?”

1522
01:29:28,837 --> 01:29:32,347
“I didn’t think you’d
quibble,” flashed Molly.

1523
01:29:32,347 --> 01:29:33,844
“I’m not a lawyer myself.”

1524
01:29:33,844 --> 01:29:37,641
A man less wise than Judge Henry would
have smiled at this,

1525
01:29:37,641 --> 01:29:40,972
and then war would have exploded
hopelessly between them,

1526
01:29:40,972 --> 01:29:44,662
and harm been added to what
was going wrong already.

1527
01:29:44,662 --> 01:29:49,354
But the Judge knew that he must give to
every word that the girl said

1528
01:29:49,354 --> 01:29:52,075
now his perfect consideration.

1529
01:29:52,075 --> 01:29:55,641
“I don’t mean to quibble,” he assured her.

1530
01:29:55,641 --> 01:30:00,473
“I know the trick of escaping from one
question by asking another.

1531
01:30:00,473 --> 01:30:04,380
But I don’t want to escape from anything
you hold me to answer.

1532
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:08,148
If you can show me that I am wrong,
I want you to do so.

1533
01:30:08,148 --> 01:30:13,111
But,” and here the Judge smiled,
“I want you to play fair, too.”

1534
01:30:13,111 --> 01:30:15,372
“And how am I not?”

1535
01:30:15,372 --> 01:30:24,423
“I want you to be just as willing to be
put right by me as I am to be

1536
01:30:24,423 --> 01:30:26,182
put right by you.

1537
01:30:26,182 --> 01:30:30,574
And so when you use such a word as
principle, you must help me to answer by

1538
01:30:30,574 --> 01:30:32,709
saying what principle you mean.

1539
01:30:32,709 --> 01:30:37,494
For in all sincerity I see no likeness in
principle whatever between burning

1540
01:30:37,494 --> 01:30:44,804
Southern negroes in public and hanging
Wyoming horse-thieves in private.

1541
01:30:44,804 --> 01:30:51,297
I consider the burning a proof that the
South is semi-barbarous,

1542
01:30:51,297 --> 01:30:57,985
and the hanging a proof that Wyoming is
determined to become civilized.

1543
01:30:57,985 --> 01:31:00,732
We do not torture our criminals
when we lynch them.

1544
01:31:00,732 --> 01:31:06,091
We do not invite spectators to
enjoy their death agony.

1545
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:10,405
We put no such hideous disgrace
upon the United States.

1546
01:31:10,405 --> 01:31:15,725
We execute our criminals by the swiftest
means, and in the quietest way.

1547
01:31:15,725 --> 01:31:17,885
Do you think the principle is the same?”

1548
01:31:17,885 --> 01:31:20,757
Molly had listened to him with attention.

1549
01:31:20,757 --> 01:31:23,407
“The way is different,” she admitted.

1550
01:31:23,407 --> 01:31:24,628
“Only the way?”

1551
01:31:24,628 --> 01:31:26,029
“So it seems to me.

1552
01:31:26,029 --> 01:31:30,362
Both defy law and order.”

1553
01:31:30,362 --> 01:31:31,922
“Ah, but do they both?

1554
01:31:31,922 --> 01:31:33,407
Now we’re getting near the principle.”

1555
01:31:33,407 --> 01:31:34,500
“Why, yes.

1556
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,695
Ordinary citizens take the law
in their own hands.”

1557
01:31:37,695 --> 01:31:39,604
“The principle at last!”

1558
01:31:39,604 --> 01:31:41,216
exclaimed the Judge.

1559
01:31:41,216 --> 01:31:43,951
“Now tell me some more things.

1560
01:31:43,951 --> 01:31:46,287
Out of whose hands do they take the law?”

1561
01:31:46,287 --> 01:31:47,168
“The court’s.”

1562
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:50,109
“What made the courts?”

1563
01:31:50,109 --> 01:31:52,559
“I don’t understand.”

1564
01:31:52,559 --> 01:31:55,937
“How did there come to be any courts?”

1565
01:31:55,937 --> 01:31:55,937
“The Constitution.”

1566
01:31:55,937 --> 01:31:57,550
“How did there come to
be any Constitution?

1567
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:58,310
Who made it?”

1568
01:31:58,310 --> 01:32:00,012
“The delegates, I suppose.”

1569
01:32:00,012 --> 01:32:01,329
“Who made the delegates?”

1570
01:32:01,329 --> 01:32:06,609
“I suppose they were elected,
or appointed, or something.”

1571
01:32:06,609 --> 01:32:08,050
“And who elected them?”

1572
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:09,788
“Of course the people elected them.”

1573
01:32:09,788 --> 01:32:13,010
“Call them the ordinary
citizens,” said the Judge.

1574
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:14,333
“I like your term.

1575
01:32:14,333 --> 01:32:17,541
They are where the law
comes from, you see.

1576
01:32:17,541 --> 01:32:20,730
For they chose the delegates who made the
Constitution that provided

1577
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:23,171
for the courts.

1578
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:24,651
There’s your machinery.

1579
01:32:24,651 --> 01:32:31,482
These are the hands into which ordinary
citizens have put the law.

1580
01:32:31,482 --> 01:32:35,082
So you see, at best, when they lynch they
only take back what they once gave.

1581
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:38,830
Now we’ll take your two cases that you
say are the same in principle.

1582
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:40,668
I think that they are not.

1583
01:32:40,668 --> 01:32:44,723
For in the South they take a negro from
jail where he was waiting

1584
01:32:44,723 --> 01:32:46,662
to be duly hung.

1585
01:32:46,662 --> 01:32:50,304
The South has never claimed that the law
would let him go.

1586
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:55,569
But in Wyoming the law has been letting
our cattle-thieves go for two years.

1587
01:32:55,569 --> 01:32:59,595
We are in a very bad way,
and we are trying to make that way a

1588
01:32:59,595 --> 01:33:04,050
little better until civilization
can reach us.

1589
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:06,932
At present we lie beyond its pale.

1590
01:33:06,932 --> 01:33:11,773
The courts, or rather the juries,
into whose hands we have put the law,

1591
01:33:11,773 --> 01:33:13,425
are not dealing the law.

1592
01:33:13,425 --> 01:33:17,015
They are withered hands,
or rather they are imitation hands made

1593
01:33:17,015 --> 01:33:19,925
for show, with no life in them, no grip.

1594
01:33:19,925 --> 01:33:21,845
They cannot hold a cattle-thief.

1595
01:33:21,845 --> 01:33:26,688
And so when your ordinary citizen sees
this, and sees that he has placed

1596
01:33:26,688 --> 01:33:35,389
justice in a dead hand,
he must take justice back into his own

1597
01:33:35,389 --> 01:33:38,719
hands where it was once at the
beginning of all things.

1598
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:40,817
Call this primitive, if you will.

1599
01:33:40,817 --> 01:33:46,233
But so far from being a defiance of the
law, it is an assertion of it⁠—the

1600
01:33:46,233 --> 01:33:51,273
fundamental assertion of self governing
men, upon whom our whole

1601
01:33:51,273 --> 01:33:53,653
social fabric is based.

1602
01:33:53,653 --> 01:33:57,423
There is your principle,
Miss Wood, as I see it.

1603
01:33:57,423 --> 01:34:00,355
Now can you help me to
see anything different?”

1604
01:34:00,355 --> 01:34:01,355
She could not.

1605
01:34:01,355 --> 01:34:04,240
“But perhaps you are of
the same opinion still?”

1606
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:05,555
the Judge inquired.

1607
01:34:05,555 --> 01:34:08,905
“It is all terrible to me,” she said.

1608
01:34:08,905 --> 01:34:12,133
“Yes; and so is capital
punishment terrible.

1609
01:34:12,133 --> 01:34:14,809
And so is war.

1610
01:34:14,809 --> 01:34:19,100
And perhaps some day we
shall do without them.

1611
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:23,012
But they are none of them so terrible as
unchecked theft and murder would be.”

1612
01:34:23,012 --> 01:34:27,475
After the Judge had departed on his way
to Sunk Creek, no one spoke to

1613
01:34:27,475 --> 01:34:29,100
Molly upon this subject.

1614
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:32,059
But her face did not grow
cheerful at once.

1615
01:34:32,059 --> 01:34:36,469
It was plain from her fits of silence
that her thoughts were not at rest.

1616
01:34:36,469 --> 01:34:41,026
And sometimes at night she would stand in
front of her lover’s likeness,

1617
01:34:41,026 --> 01:34:44,012
gazing upon it with both
love and shrinking.

1618
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:45,064
CHAPTER XXXIV

1619
01:34:45,064 --> 01:34:46,289
To Fit Her Finger

1620
01:34:46,289 --> 01:34:50,113
It was two rings that the Virginian wrote
for when next I heard from him.

1621
01:34:50,113 --> 01:34:54,879
After my dark sight of what the Cattle
Land could be, I soon had journeyed home

1622
01:34:54,879 --> 01:34:57,758
by way of Washakie and Rawlins.

1623
01:34:57,758 --> 01:35:02,537
Steve and Shorty did not leave my memory,
nor will they ever, I suppose.

1624
01:35:02,537 --> 01:35:05,779
The Virginian had touched the whole thing
the day I left him.

1625
01:35:05,779 --> 01:35:10,495
He had noticed me looking a sort of
farewell at the plains and mountains.

1626
01:35:10,495 --> 01:35:12,618
“You will come back to it,” he said.

1627
01:35:12,618 --> 01:35:17,391
“If there was a headstone for every man
that once pleasured in his freedom here,

1628
01:35:17,391 --> 01:35:20,301
yu’d see one most every time
yu’ turned your head.

1629
01:35:20,301 --> -1:59:59,000
It’s a heap sadder than a graveyard⁠—but
yu’ love it all the same.

1630
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1631
01:35:24,335 --> 01:35:28,505
Sadness had passed from him⁠—from his
uppermost mood, at least,

1632
01:35:28,505 --> 01:35:29,840
when he wrote about the rings.

1633
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:33,769
Deep in him was sadness of course,
as well as joy.

1634
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:37,041
For he had known Steve,
and he had covered Shorty with earth.

1635
01:35:37,041 --> 01:35:43,784
He had looked upon life with a marksman’s
eyes, very close; and no one,

1636
01:35:43,784 --> 01:35:50,412
if he have a heart, can pass through
this and not carry sadness in his

1637
01:35:50,412 --> 01:35:52,646
spirit with him forever.

1638
01:35:52,646 --> 01:35:55,805
But he seldom shows it openly;
it bides within him,

1639
01:35:55,805 --> 01:36:01,545
enriching his cheerfulness and rendering
him of better service to his fellow-men.

1640
01:36:01,545 --> 01:36:05,660
It was a commission of cheerfulness that
he now gave, being distant from where

1641
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:07,142
rings are to be bought.

1642
01:36:07,142 --> 01:36:11,617
He could not go so far as the East to
procure what he had planned.

1643
01:36:11,617 --> 01:36:15,544
Rings were to be had in Cheyenne,
and a still greater choice in Denver;

1644
01:36:15,544 --> 01:36:19,233
and so far as either of these towns his
affairs would have permitted

1645
01:36:19,233 --> 01:36:20,020
him to travel.

1646
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:23,358
But he was set upon having
rings from the East.

1647
01:36:23,358 --> 01:36:27,164
They must come from the best place in the
country; nothing short of that was good

1648
01:36:27,164 --> 01:36:29,952
enough “to fit her finger,” as he said.

1649
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:33,057
The wedding ring was a simple matter.

1650
01:36:33,057 --> 01:36:38,554
Let it be right, that was all:
the purest gold that could be used,

1651
01:36:38,554 --> 01:36:43,740
with her initials and his together
graven round the inside,

1652
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:46,337
with the day of the month and the year.

1653
01:36:46,337 --> 01:36:48,500
The date was now set.

1654
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:52,191
It had come so far as this.

1655
01:36:52,191 --> 01:36:54,392
July third was to be the day.

1656
01:36:54,392 --> 01:37:00,544
Then for sixty days and nights he was to
be a bridegroom, free from his duties at

1657
01:37:00,544 --> 01:37:07,536
Sunk Creek, free to take his bride
wheresoever she might choose to go.

1658
01:37:07,536 --> 01:37:09,011
And she had chosen.

1659
01:37:09,011 --> 01:37:13,016
Those voices of the world had more than
angered her; for after the anger a

1660
01:37:13,016 --> 01:37:14,447
set purpose was left.

1661
01:37:14,447 --> 01:37:20,110
Her sister should have the chance neither
to come nor to stay away.

1662
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:23,452
Had her mother even answered the
Virginian’s letter, there could

1663
01:37:23,452 --> 01:37:24,795
have been some relenting.

1664
01:37:24,795 --> 01:37:28,852
But the poor lady had been inadequate in
this, as in all other searching moments

1665
01:37:28,852 --> 01:37:33,912
of her life: she had sent messages⁠—kind
ones, to be sure⁠—but only messages.

1666
01:37:33,912 --> 01:37:36,988
If this had hurt the Virginian,
no one knew it in the world,

1667
01:37:36,988 --> 01:37:41,355
least of all the girl in whose heart it
had left a cold, frozen spot.

1668
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:45,989
Not a good spirit in which to be
married, you will say.

1669
01:37:45,989 --> 01:37:49,064
No; frozen spots are not good at any time.

1670
01:37:49,064 --> 01:37:53,127
But Molly’s own nature
gave her due punishment.

1671
01:37:53,127 --> 01:37:57,192
Through all these days of her warm
happiness a chill current ran,

1672
01:37:57,192 --> 01:38:01,018
like those which interrupt
the swimmer’s perfect joy.

1673
01:38:01,018 --> 01:38:05,791
The girl was only half as happy as her
lover; but she hid this deep from him⁠—

1674
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:11,205
hid it until that final,
fierce hour of reckoning that her nature

1675
01:38:11,205 --> 01:38:16,078
had with her⁠—nay, was bound to have
with her, before the punishment was

1676
01:38:16,078 --> 01:38:21,000
lifted, and the frozen spot melted at
length from her heart.

1677
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,763
So, meanwhile, she made
her decree against Bennington.

1678
01:38:25,763 --> 01:38:29,543
Not Vermont, but Wyoming,
should be her wedding place.

1679
01:38:29,543 --> 01:38:34,854
No world’s voices should be whispering,
no world’s eyes should be looking on,

1680
01:38:34,854 --> 01:38:38,663
when she made her vow to him
and received his vow.

1681
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:44,953
Those voices should be spoken and that
ring put on in this wild Cattle Land,

1682
01:38:44,953 --> 01:38:49,956
where first she had seen him ride into
the flooded river, and lift her

1683
01:38:49,956 --> 01:38:52,184
ashore upon his horse.

1684
01:38:52,184 --> 01:38:58,681
It was this open sky which should shine
down on them, and this frontier soil

1685
01:38:58,681 --> 01:39:01,507
upon which their feet should tread.

1686
01:39:01,507 --> 01:39:05,599
The world should take its turn second.

1687
01:39:05,599 --> 01:39:10,859
After a month with him by stream and
canyon, a month far deeper into the

1688
01:39:10,859 --> 01:39:16,905
mountain wilds than ever yet he had been
free to take her, a month with sometimes

1689
01:39:16,905 --> 01:39:22,887
a tent and sometimes the stars above
them, and only their horses besides

1690
01:39:22,887 --> 01:39:29,302
themselves⁠—after such a month as this,
she would take him to her mother and to

1691
01:39:29,302 --> 01:39:33,102
Bennington; and the old aunt over at
Dunbarton would look at him,

1692
01:39:33,102 --> 01:39:38,553
and be once more able to declare that
the Starks had always preferred a man

1693
01:39:38,553 --> 01:39:40,434
who was a man.

1694
01:39:40,434 --> 01:39:44,887
And so July third was to be engraved
inside the wedding ring.

1695
01:39:44,887 --> 01:39:48,974
Upon the other ring the Virginian had
spent much delicious meditation,

1696
01:39:48,974 --> 01:39:50,759
all in his secret mind.

1697
01:39:50,759 --> 01:39:54,367
He had even got the right measure of her
finger without her suspecting the

1698
01:39:54,367 --> 01:39:54,967
reason.

1699
01:39:54,967 --> 01:39:59,289
But this step was the final
one in his plan.

1700
01:39:59,289 --> 01:40:03,249
During the time that his thoughts had
begun to be busy over the other ring,

1701
01:40:03,249 --> 01:40:07,128
by a chance he had learned from Mrs.
Henry a number of old

1702
01:40:07,128 --> 01:40:11,260
fancies regarding precious stones.

1703
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:12,239
Mrs.

1704
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:16,543
Henry often accompanied the Judge in
venturesome mountain climbs,

1705
01:40:16,543 --> 01:40:21,921
and sometimes the steepness of the rocks
required her to use her hands for

1706
01:40:21,921 --> 01:40:22,664
safety.

1707
01:40:22,664 --> 01:40:26,686
One day when the Virginian went with them
to help mark out certain boundary

1708
01:40:26,686 --> 01:40:30,373
corners, she removed her rings lest they
should get scratched;

1709
01:40:30,373 --> 01:40:34,585
and he, being just behind her,
took them during the climb.

1710
01:40:34,585 --> 01:40:38,776
“I see you’re looking at my topaz,”
she had said, as he returned them.

1711
01:40:38,776 --> 01:40:41,617
“If I could have chosen,
it would have been a ruby.

1712
01:40:41,617 --> 01:40:43,195
But I was born in November.”

1713
01:40:43,195 --> 01:40:47,750
He did not understand her in the least,
but her words awakened exceeding

1714
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:51,270
interest in him; and they had descended
some five miles of mountain

1715
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:52,626
before he spoke again.

1716
01:40:52,626 --> 01:40:56,501
Then he became ingenious,
for he had half worked out what Mrs.

1717
01:40:56,501 --> 01:41:00,126
Henry’s meaning must be;
but he must make quite sure.

1718
01:41:00,126 --> 01:41:05,668
Therefore, according to his wild,
shy nature, he became ingenious.

1719
01:41:05,668 --> 01:41:08,891
“Men wear rings,” he began.

1720
01:41:08,891 --> 01:41:10,881
“Some of the men on the ranch do.

1721
01:41:10,881 --> 01:41:14,338
I don’t see any harm in a
man’s wearin’ a ring.

1722
01:41:14,338 --> -1:59:59,000
But I never have.

1723
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1724
01:41:15,479 --> 01:41:18,879
“Well,” said the lady,
not yet suspecting that he was

1725
01:41:18,879 --> 01:41:23,840
undertaking to circumvent her,
“probably those men have sweethearts.”

1726
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,890
“No, ma’am.

1727
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:29,276
Not sweethearts worth wearin’ rings for⁠—
in two cases, anyway.

1728
01:41:29,276 --> 01:41:31,002
They won ’em at cyards.

1729
01:41:31,002 --> 01:41:33,534
And they like to see ’em shine.

1730
01:41:33,534 --> 01:41:36,033
I never saw a man wear a topaz.”

1731
01:41:36,033 --> 01:41:36,353
Mrs.

1732
01:41:36,353 --> 01:41:39,206
Henry did not have any
further remark to make.

1733
01:41:39,206 --> 01:41:43,917
“I was born in January myself,”
pursued the Virginian, very

1734
01:41:43,917 --> 01:41:44,707
thoughtfully.

1735
01:41:44,707 --> 01:41:49,781
Then the lady gave him one look,
and without further process of mind

1736
01:41:49,781 --> 01:41:52,506
perceived exactly what he was driving
at.

1737
01:41:52,506 --> 01:41:56,224
“That’s very extravagant
for rings,” said she.

1738
01:41:56,224 --> 01:41:59,139
“January is diamonds.”

1739
01:41:59,139 --> 01:42:03,634
“Diamonds,” murmured the Virginian,
more and more thoughtfully.

1740
01:42:03,634 --> 01:42:07,508
“Well, it don’t matter,
for I’d not wear a ring.

1741
01:42:07,508 --> 01:42:10,883
And November is⁠—what did yu’ say, ma’am?”

1742
01:42:10,883 --> 01:42:12,793
“Topaz.”

1743
01:42:12,793 --> 01:42:13,688
“Yes.

1744
01:42:13,688 --> 01:42:17,010
Well, jewels are cert’nly pretty things.

1745
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:20,876
In the Spanish Missions yu’ll see large
ones now and again.

1746
01:42:20,876 --> 01:42:22,949
And they’re not glass, I think.

1747
01:42:22,949 --> 01:42:26,356
And so they have got some jewel that kind
of belongs to each month

1748
01:42:26,356 --> 01:42:27,636
right around the twelve?”

1749
01:42:27,636 --> 01:42:30,950
“Yes,” said Mrs. Henry, smiling.

1750
01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:33,581
“One for each month.

1751
01:42:33,581 --> 01:42:35,688
But the opal is what you want.”

1752
01:42:35,688 --> 01:42:38,034
He looked at her, and began to blush.

1753
01:42:38,034 --> 01:42:41,609
“October is the opal,”
she added, and she laughed outright,

1754
01:42:41,609 --> 01:42:44,840
for Miss Wood’s birthday was on the
fifteenth of that month.

1755
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:49,412
The Virginian smiled guiltily at
her through his crimson.

1756
01:42:49,412 --> 01:42:53,065
“I’ve no doubt you can beat around the
bush very well with men,”

1757
01:42:53,065 --> 01:42:55,321
said Mrs. Henry.

1758
01:42:55,321 --> 01:42:59,933
“But it’s perfectly transparent with us⁠—
in matters of sentiment, at least.”

1759
01:42:59,933 --> 01:43:04,248
“Well, I am sorry,” he presently said.

1760
01:43:04,248 --> 01:43:07,059
“I don’t want to give her an opal.

1761
01:43:07,059 --> 01:43:10,172
I have no superstition,
but I don’t want to give her an opal.

1762
01:43:10,172 --> 01:43:14,289
If her mother did, or anybody like
that, why, all right.

1763
01:43:14,289 --> 01:43:15,969
But not from me.

1764
01:43:15,969 --> -1:59:59,000
D’ yu’ understand, ma’am?

1765
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1766
01:43:17,854 --> 01:43:18,169
Mrs.

1767
01:43:18,169 --> 01:43:23,352
Henry did understand this subtle trait in
the wild man, and she rejoiced to be

1768
01:43:23,352 --> 01:43:26,660
able to give him immediate
reassurance concerning opals.

1769
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:29,007
“Don’t worry about that,” she said.

1770
01:43:29,007 --> 01:43:33,839
“The opal is said to bring ill luck,
but not when it is your own month stone.

1771
01:43:33,839 --> 01:43:39,028
Then it is supposed to be not only
deprived of evil influence,

1772
01:43:39,028 --> 01:43:42,169
but to possess peculiarly
fortunate power.

1773
01:43:42,169 --> -1:59:59,000
Let it be an opal ring.

1774
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1775
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:49,317
Then he asked her boldly various
questions, and she showed him her rings,

1776
01:43:49,317 --> 01:43:51,798
and gave him advice about the setting.

1777
01:43:51,798 --> 01:43:56,996
There was no special custom,
she told him, ruling such rings as this

1778
01:43:56,996 --> 01:43:58,358
he desired to bestow.

1779
01:43:58,358 --> 01:44:01,956
The gem might be the lady’s favorite or
the lover’s favorite;

1780
01:44:01,956 --> 01:44:06,227
and to choose the lady’s month stone
was very well indeed.

1781
01:44:06,227 --> 01:44:09,236
Very well indeed, the Virginian thought.

1782
01:44:09,236 --> 01:44:14,456
But not quite well enough for him.

1783
01:44:14,456 --> 01:44:20,534
His mind now busied itself with this lore
concerning jewels, and soon his

1784
01:44:20,534 --> 01:44:24,232
sentiment had suggested something which
he forthwith carried out.

1785
01:44:24,232 --> 01:44:27,765
When the ring was achieved,
it was an opal, but set with

1786
01:44:27,765 --> 01:44:31,397
four small embracing diamonds.

1787
01:44:31,397 --> 01:44:36,431
Thus was her month stone joined with his,
that their luck and their love

1788
01:44:36,431 --> 01:44:39,082
might be inseparably clasped.

1789
01:44:39,082 --> 01:44:43,857
He found the size of her finger one day
when winter had departed,

1790
01:44:43,857 --> 01:44:46,022
and the early grass was green.

1791
01:44:46,022 --> 01:44:49,688
He made a ring of twisted grass for her,
while she held her hand for

1792
01:44:49,688 --> 01:44:50,658
him to bind it.

1793
01:44:50,658 --> 01:44:52,208
He made another for himself.

1794
01:44:52,208 --> 01:44:56,048
Then, after each had worn their grass
ring for a while, he

1795
01:44:56,048 --> 01:44:58,005
begged her to exchange.

1796
01:44:58,005 --> 01:45:02,765
He did not send his token away from him,
but most carefully measured it.

1797
01:45:02,765 --> 01:45:08,179
Thus the ring fitted her well,
and the lustrous flame within the opal

1798
01:45:08,179 --> 01:45:11,040
thrilled his heart each time he saw it.

1799
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,708
For now June was near its end;
and that other plain gold ring,

1800
01:45:14,708 --> 01:45:19,118
which, for safe keeping,
he cherished suspended round his neck

1801
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:22,557
day and night, seemed to burn with an
inward glow that was

1802
01:45:22,557 --> 01:45:24,734
deeper than the opal’s.

1803
01:45:24,734 --> 01:45:28,979
So in due course arrived
the second of July.

1804
01:45:28,979 --> 01:45:33,411
Molly’s punishment had got as far as
this: she longed for her mother to be

1805
01:45:33,411 --> 01:45:35,804
near her at this time;
but it was too late.

1806
01:45:35,804 --> 01:45:37,211
CHAPTER XXXV

1807
01:45:37,211 --> 01:45:39,452
With Malice Aforethought

1808
01:45:39,452 --> 01:45:44,951
Town lay twelve straight miles before the
lover and his sweetheart,

1809
01:45:44,951 --> 01:45:47,975
when they came to the brow of
the last long hill.

1810
01:45:47,975 --> 01:45:53,528
All beneath them was like a map:
neither man nor beast distinguishable,

1811
01:45:53,528 --> 01:45:58,632
but the veined and tinted image of a
country, knobs and flats set out in

1812
01:45:58,632 --> 01:46:02,181
order clearly, shining extensive and
motionless in the sun.

1813
01:46:02,181 --> 01:46:06,600
It opened on the sight of the lovers as
they reached the sudden edge of the

1814
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:11,160
tableland, where since morning they had
ridden with the head of neither horse

1815
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,046
ever in advance of the other.

1816
01:46:13,046 --> 01:46:17,850
At the view of their journey’s end,
the Virginian looked down at his girl

1817
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:23,116
beside him, his eyes filled with a
bridegroom’s light, and,

1818
01:46:23,116 --> 01:46:28,058
hanging safe upon his breast,
he could feel the gold ring that he

1819
01:46:28,058 --> 01:46:32,085
would slowly press upon
her finger tomorrow.

1820
01:46:32,085 --> 01:46:36,762
He drew off the glove from her left hand,
and stooping, kissed the jewel in that

1821
01:46:36,762 --> 01:46:38,551
other ring which he had given her.

1822
01:46:38,551 --> 01:46:42,464
The crimson fire in the opal seemed to
mingle with that in his heart,

1823
01:46:42,464 --> 01:46:46,238
and his arm lifted her during a moment
from the saddle as he held her to him.

1824
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:51,166
But in her heart the love of him was
troubled by that cold pang of loneliness

1825
01:46:51,166 --> 01:46:55,303
which had crept upon her like a tide as
the day drew near.

1826
01:46:55,303 --> 01:46:59,143
None of her own people were waiting in
that distant town to see

1827
01:46:59,143 --> 01:47:00,519
her become his bride.

1828
01:47:00,519 --> 01:47:05,576
Friendly faces she might pass on the way;
but all of them new friends,

1829
01:47:05,576 --> 01:47:11,240
made in this wild country:
not a face of her childhood would smile

1830
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:15,721
upon her; and deep within her,
a voice cried for the mother who was

1831
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:18,062
far away in Vermont.

1832
01:47:18,062 --> 01:47:25,651
That she would see Mrs. Taylor’s kind
face at her wedding was no comfort now.

1833
01:47:25,651 --> 01:47:29,600
There lay the town in the
splendor of Wyoming space.

1834
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:35,690
Around it spread the watered fields,
westward for a little way,

1835
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:39,530
eastward to a great distance,
making squares of green and yellow

1836
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:46,410
crops; and the town was but a poor rag
in the midst of this quilted harvest.

1837
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:50,123
After the fields to the east,
the tawny plain began;

1838
01:47:50,123 --> 01:47:54,363
and with one faint furrow of river
lining its undulations,

1839
01:47:54,363 --> 01:47:56,019
it stretched beyond sight.

1840
01:47:56,019 --> 01:48:00,493
But west of the town rose the Bow Leg
Mountains, cool with their still

1841
01:48:00,493 --> 01:48:05,267
unmelted snows and their dull
blue gulfs of pine.

1842
01:48:05,267 --> 01:48:10,038
From three canyons flowed three clear
forks which began the river.

1843
01:48:10,038 --> 01:48:14,979
Their confluence was above the town a
good two miles; it looked but a few

1844
01:48:14,979 --> 01:48:20,838
paces from up here, while each side the
river straggled the margin cottonwoods,

1845
01:48:20,838 --> 01:48:23,806
like thin borders along a garden walk.

1846
01:48:23,806 --> 01:48:30,574
Over all this map hung silence like a
harmony, tremendous yet serene.

1847
01:48:30,574 --> 01:48:31,614
“How beautiful!

1848
01:48:31,614 --> 01:48:33,368
how I love it!”

1849
01:48:33,368 --> 01:48:34,448
whispered the girl.

1850
01:48:34,448 --> 01:48:36,559
“But, oh, how big it is!”

1851
01:48:36,559 --> 01:48:38,752
And she leaned against her
lover for an instant.

1852
01:48:38,752 --> 01:48:41,139
It was her spirit seeking shelter.

1853
01:48:41,139 --> 01:48:45,450
Today, this vast beauty,
this primal calm, had in it for her

1854
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:47,450
something almost of dread.

1855
01:48:47,450 --> 01:48:51,606
The small, comfortable,
green hills of home rose before her.

1856
01:48:51,606 --> 01:48:56,462
She closed her eyes and saw Vermont:
a village street, and the post-office,

1857
01:48:56,462 --> 01:49:00,022
and ivy covering an old front door,
and her mother picking some yellow

1858
01:49:00,022 --> 01:49:01,462
roses from a bush.

1859
01:49:01,462 --> 01:49:06,735
At a sound, her eyes quickly opened;
and here was her lover turned in his

1860
01:49:06,735 --> 01:49:09,485
saddle, watching another
horseman approach.

1861
01:49:09,485 --> 01:49:13,589
She saw the Virginian’s hand in a certain
position, and knew that

1862
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:15,109
his pistol was ready.

1863
01:49:15,109 --> 01:49:20,178
But the other merely overtook and passed
them, as they stood at the

1864
01:49:20,178 --> 01:49:21,584
brow of the hill.

1865
01:49:21,584 --> 01:49:25,758
The man had given one nod to the
Virginian, and the Virginian one to him;

1866
01:49:25,758 --> 01:49:28,721
and now he was already below them
on the descending road.

1867
01:49:28,721 --> 01:49:33,589
To Molly Wood he was a stranger;
but she had seen his eyes when he nodded

1868
01:49:33,589 --> 01:49:37,756
to her lover, and she knew,
even without the pistol,

1869
01:49:37,756 --> 01:49:41,977
that this was not enmity at first sight.

1870
01:49:41,977 --> 01:49:45,587
It was not indeed.

1871
01:49:45,587 --> 01:49:49,531
Five years of gathered hate had looked
out of the man’s eyes.

1872
01:49:49,531 --> 01:49:52,532
And she asked her lover who this was.

1873
01:49:52,532 --> 01:49:56,123
“Oh,” said he, easily,
“just a man I see now and then.”

1874
01:49:56,123 --> 01:49:58,914
“Is his name Trampas?”

1875
01:49:58,914 --> 01:50:00,008
said Molly Wood.

1876
01:50:00,008 --> 01:50:02,937
The Virginian looked at her in surprise.

1877
01:50:02,937 --> 01:50:05,810
“Why, where have you seen him?”

1878
01:50:05,810 --> 01:50:07,004
he asked.

1879
01:50:07,004 --> 01:50:08,705
“Never till now.

1880
01:50:08,705 --> 01:50:09,804
But I knew.”

1881
01:50:09,804 --> 01:50:11,186
“My gracious!

1882
01:50:11,186 --> 01:50:14,670
Yu’ never told me yu’
had mind-reading powers.”

1883
01:50:14,670 --> 01:50:16,677
And he smiled serenely at her.

1884
01:50:16,677 --> 01:50:19,319
“I knew it was Trampas as soon as
I saw his eyes.”

1885
01:50:19,319 --> 01:50:20,343
“My gracious!”

1886
01:50:20,343 --> 01:50:23,106
her lover repeated with indulgent irony.

1887
01:50:23,106 --> 01:50:26,299
“I must be mighty careful of my eyes when
you’re lookin’ at ’em.”

1888
01:50:26,299 --> 01:50:28,981
“I believe he did that
murder,” said the girl.

1889
01:50:28,981 --> 01:50:30,564
“Whose mind are yu’ readin’ now?”

1890
01:50:30,564 --> 01:50:32,044
he drawled affectionately.

1891
01:50:32,044 --> 01:50:35,274
But he could not joke her off the subject.

1892
01:50:35,274 --> 01:50:39,312
She took his strong hand in hers,
tremulously, so much of it as her

1893
01:50:39,312 --> 01:50:40,872
little hand could hold.

1894
01:50:40,872 --> 01:50:45,686
“I know something about that⁠—that⁠—last
autumn,” she said, shrinking

1895
01:50:45,686 --> 01:50:47,406
from words more definite.

1896
01:50:47,406 --> 01:50:50,338
“And I know that you only did⁠—”

1897
01:50:50,338 --> 01:50:56,945
“What I had to,” he finished,
very sadly, but sternly, too.

1898
01:50:56,945 --> 01:51:01,366
“Yes,” she asserted, keeping
hold of his hand.

1899
01:51:01,366 --> 01:51:06,574
“I suppose that⁠—lynching⁠—” (she almost
whispered the word) “is the only way.

1900
01:51:06,574 --> 01:51:10,425
But when they had to die just for
stealing horses, it seems so

1901
01:51:10,425 --> 01:51:12,033
wicked that this murderer⁠—”

1902
01:51:12,033 --> 01:51:13,070
“Who can prove it?”

1903
01:51:13,070 --> 01:51:14,188
asked the Virginian.

1904
01:51:14,188 --> 01:51:15,381
“But don’t you know it?”

1905
01:51:15,381 --> 01:51:18,045
“I know a heap o’ things inside my heart.

1906
01:51:18,045 --> 01:51:19,977
But that’s not proving.

1907
01:51:19,977 --> 01:51:22,514
There was only the body,
and the hoofprints⁠—

1908
01:51:22,514 --> 01:51:24,467
and what folks guessed.”

1909
01:51:24,467 --> 01:51:26,889
“He was never even arrested!”

1910
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:28,568
the girl said.

1911
01:51:28,568 --> 01:51:29,761
“No.

1912
01:51:29,761 --> -1:59:59,000
He helped elect the sheriff in that county

1913
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.”

1914
01:51:32,828 --> 01:51:39,804
Then Molly ventured a step inside the
border of her lover’s reticence.

1915
01:51:39,804 --> 01:51:44,703
“I saw⁠—” she hesitated,
“just now, I saw what you did.”

1916
01:51:44,703 --> 01:51:47,113
He returned to his caressing irony.

1917
01:51:47,113 --> 01:51:50,222
“You’ll have me plumb scared if you
keep on seein’ things.”

1918
01:51:50,222 --> 01:51:52,025
“You had your pistol ready for him.”

1919
01:51:52,025 --> 01:51:54,431
“Why, I believe I did.

1920
01:51:54,431 --> 01:51:56,125
It was mighty unnecessary.”

1921
01:51:56,125 --> 01:52:00,545
And the Virginian took out the pistol
again, and shook his head over it,

1922
01:52:00,545 --> 01:52:03,040
like one who has been
caught in a blunder.

1923
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:07,791
She looked at him, and knew that she must
step outside his reticence again.

1924
01:52:07,791 --> 01:52:12,780
By love and her surrender to him their
positions had been exchanged.

1925
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:16,230
He was not now, as through his long
courting he had been,

1926
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:19,155
her half-obeying, half-
refractory worshipper.

1927
01:52:19,155 --> 01:52:23,991
She was no longer his half-
indulgent, half-scornful superior.

1928
01:52:23,991 --> 01:52:28,173
Her better birth and schooling that had
once been weapons to keep him at his

1929
01:52:28,173 --> 01:52:33,105
distance, or bring her off victorious in
their encounters, had given way before

1930
01:52:33,105 --> 01:52:35,597
the onset of the natural man himself.

1931
01:52:35,597 --> 01:52:38,762
She knew her cowboy lover,
with all that he lacked,

1932
01:52:38,762 --> 01:52:43,315
to be more than ever she could be,
with all that she had.

1933
01:52:43,315 --> 01:52:46,576
He was her worshipper still,
but her master, too.

1934
01:52:46,576 --> 01:52:51,441
Therefore now, against the baffling smile
he gave her, she felt powerless.

1935
01:52:51,441 --> 01:52:55,664
And once again a pang of yearning for her
mother to be near her today

1936
01:52:55,664 --> 01:52:56,744
shot through the girl.

1937
01:52:56,744 --> 01:53:02,456
She looked from her untamed man to the
untamed desert of Wyoming,

1938
01:53:02,456 --> 01:53:06,273
and the town where she was to take him
as her wedded husband.

1939
01:53:06,273 --> 01:53:10,211
But for his sake she would not let
him guess her loneliness.

1940
01:53:10,211 --> 01:53:14,755
He sat on his horse Monte,
considering the pistol.

1941
01:53:14,755 --> 01:53:20,070
Then he showed her a rattlesnake coiled
by the roots of some sagebrush.

1942
01:53:20,070 --> 01:53:21,513
“Can I hit it?”

1943
01:53:21,513 --> 01:53:22,862
he inquired.

1944
01:53:22,862 --> 01:53:27,187
“You don’t often miss them,”
said she, striving to be cheerful.

1945
01:53:27,187 --> 01:53:29,923
“Well, I’m told getting
married unstrings some men.”

1946
01:53:29,923 --> 01:53:32,876
He aimed, and the snake was shattered.

1947
01:53:32,876 --> 01:53:37,770
“Maybe it’s too early yet for
the unstringing to begin!”

1948
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:41,973
And with some deliberation he sent three
more bullets into the snake.

1949
01:53:41,973 --> 01:53:43,937
“I reckon that’s enough,” said he.

1950
01:53:43,937 --> 01:53:45,262
“Was not the first one?”

1951
01:53:45,262 --> 01:53:47,450
“Oh, yes, for the snake.”

1952
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:51,170
And then, with one leg crooked cowboy
fashion across in front of his saddle-

1953
01:53:51,170 --> 01:53:55,501
horn, he cleaned his pistol,
and replaced the empty cartridges.

1954
01:53:55,501 --> 01:53:59,647
Once more she ventured near the
line of his reticence.

1955
01:53:59,647 --> 01:54:03,125
“Has⁠—has Trampas seen you much lately?”

1956
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:06,104
“Why, no; not for a right smart while.

1957
01:54:06,104 --> 01:54:08,008
But I reckon he has not missed me.”

1958
01:54:08,008 --> 01:54:11,174
The Virginian spoke this
in his gentlest voice.

1959
01:54:11,174 --> 01:54:14,963
But his rebuffed sweetheart turned her
face away, and from her eyes

1960
01:54:14,963 --> 01:54:16,484
she brushed a tear.

1961
01:54:16,484 --> 01:54:22,084
He reined his horse Monte beside her,
and upon her cheek she felt his kiss.

1962
01:54:22,084 --> 01:54:27,371
“You are not the only mind-reader,”
said he, very tenderly.

1963
01:54:27,371 --> 01:54:31,458
And at this she clung to him,
and laid her head upon his breast.

1964
01:54:31,458 --> 01:54:35,321
“I had been thinking,”
he went on, “that the way our marriage

1965
01:54:35,321 --> 01:54:37,881
is to be was the most beautiful way.”

1966
01:54:37,881 --> 01:54:40,753
“It is the most beautiful,” she murmured.

1967
01:54:40,753 --> 01:54:44,681
He slowly spoke out his thought,
as if she had not said this.

1968
01:54:44,681 --> 01:54:51,192
“No folks to stare, no fuss,
no jokes and ribbons and best bonnets,

1969
01:54:51,192 --> 01:54:55,756
no public eye nor talkin’ of tongues
when most yu’ want to hear

1970
01:54:55,756 --> 01:54:59,140
nothing and say nothing.”

1971
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:01,668
She answered by holding him closer.

1972
01:55:01,668 --> 01:55:06,831
“Just the bishop of Wyoming to join us,
and not even him after we’re once

1973
01:55:06,831 --> 01:55:07,390
joined.

1974
01:55:07,390 --> 01:55:10,910
I did think that would be ahead of all
ways to get married I have seen.”

1975
01:55:10,910 --> 01:55:13,790
He paused again, and she
made no rejoinder.

1976
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:15,550
“But we have left out your mother.”

1977
01:55:15,550 --> 01:55:18,307
She looked in his face
with quick astonishment.

1978
01:55:18,307 --> 01:55:22,631
It was as if his spirit had heard the
cry of her spirit.

1979
01:55:22,631 --> 01:55:27,488
“That is nowhere near right,” he said.

1980
01:55:27,488 --> 01:55:30,159
“That is wrong.”

1981
01:55:30,159 --> 01:55:35,145
“She could never have come
here,” said the girl.

1982
01:55:35,145 --> 01:55:37,544
“We should have gone there.

1983
01:55:37,544 --> 01:55:40,363
I don’t know how I can ask
her to forgive me.”

1984
01:55:40,363 --> 01:55:42,724
“But it was not you!”

1985
01:55:42,724 --> 01:55:43,535
cried Molly.

1986
01:55:43,535 --> 01:55:44,437
“Yes.

1987
01:55:44,437 --> 01:55:46,357
Because I did not object.

1988
01:55:46,357 --> 01:55:49,468
I did not tell you we must go to her.

1989
01:55:49,468 --> 01:55:53,092
I missed the point, thinking so much
about my own feelings.

1990
01:55:53,092 --> 01:55:58,245
For you see⁠—and I’ve never said this to
you until now⁠—your mother did hurt me.

1991
01:55:58,245 --> 01:56:02,250
When you said you would have me after my
years of waiting, and I wrote her that

1992
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:07,995
letter telling her all about myself,
and how my family was not like yours,

1993
01:56:07,995 --> 01:56:12,728
and⁠—and⁠—all the rest I told her,
why you see it hurt me never to get a

1994
01:56:12,728 --> 01:56:18,291
word back from her except
just messages through you.

1995
01:56:18,291 --> 01:56:22,057
For I had talked to her about my
hopes and my failings.

1996
01:56:22,057 --> 01:56:25,827
I had said more than ever I’ve said to
you, because she was your mother.

1997
01:56:25,827 --> 01:56:29,767
I wanted her to forgive me,
if she could, and feel that maybe I

1998
01:56:29,767 --> 01:56:31,806
could take good care of you after all.

1999
01:56:31,806 --> 01:56:34,807
For it was bad enough to have her
daughter quit her home to teach school

2000
01:56:34,807 --> 01:56:36,683
out hyeh on Bear Creek.

2001
01:56:36,683 --> 01:56:39,895
Bad enough without havin’ me to come
along and make it worse.

2002
01:56:39,895 --> 01:56:43,738
I have missed the point in thinking
of my own feelings.”

2003
01:56:43,738 --> 01:56:45,630
“But it’s not your doing!”

2004
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:46,781
repeated Molly.

2005
01:56:46,781 --> 01:56:51,845
With his deep delicacy he had put the
whole matter as a hardship

2006
01:56:51,845 --> 01:56:54,137
to her mother alone.

2007
01:56:54,137 --> 01:56:57,998
He had saved her any pain
of confession or denial.

2008
01:56:57,998 --> 01:57:00,600
“Yes, it is my doing,” he now said.

2009
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:01,738
“Shall we give it up?”

2010
01:57:01,738 --> 01:57:02,509
“Give what⁠—?”

2011
01:57:02,509 --> 01:57:03,980
She did not understand.

2012
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:05,630
“Why, the order we’ve got it fixed in.

2013
01:57:05,630 --> 01:57:09,218
Plans are⁠—well, they’re
no more than plans.

2014
01:57:09,218 --> 01:57:13,020
I hate the notion of changing,
but I hate hurting your mother more.

2015
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:15,493
Or, anyway, I ought to hate it more.

2016
01:57:15,493 --> 01:57:18,135
So we can shift, if yu’ say so.

2017
01:57:18,135 --> 01:57:19,991
It’s not too late.”

2018
01:57:19,991 --> 01:57:20,631
“Shift?”

2019
01:57:20,631 --> 01:57:21,591
she faltered.

2020
01:57:21,591 --> 01:57:24,896
“I mean, we can go to your home now.

2021
01:57:24,896 --> 01:57:27,323
We can start by the stage tonight.

2022
01:57:27,323 --> 01:57:29,722
Your mother can see us married.

2023
01:57:29,722 --> 01:57:33,707
We can come back and finish in the
mountains instead of beginning in them.

2024
01:57:33,707 --> -1:59:59,000
It’ll be just merely shifting, yu’ see.

2025
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2026
01:57:36,905 --> 01:57:41,525
He could scarcely bring himself to say
this at all; yet he said it almost as if

2027
01:57:41,525 --> 01:57:42,605
he were urging it.

2028
01:57:42,605 --> 01:57:47,223
It implied a renunciation that he could
hardly bear to think of.

2029
01:57:47,223 --> 01:57:51,646
To put off his wedding day,
the bliss upon whose threshold he stood

2030
01:57:51,646 --> 01:57:56,206
after his three years of faithful battle
for it, and that wedding journey he had

2031
01:57:56,206 --> 01:58:01,383
arranged: for there were the mountains
in sight, the woods and canyons where he

2032
01:58:01,383 --> 01:58:04,816
had planned to go with her after the
bishop had joined them;

2033
01:58:04,816 --> 01:58:11,000
the solitudes where only the wild
animals would be, besides themselves.

2034
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:16,453
His horses, his tent,
his rifle, his rod, all were waiting

2035
01:58:16,453 --> 01:58:18,583
ready in the town for
their start tomorrow.

2036
01:58:18,583 --> 01:58:22,604
He had provided many dainty things
to make her comfortable.

2037
01:58:22,604 --> 01:58:27,487
Well, he could wait a little more,
having waited three years.

2038
01:58:27,487 --> 01:58:32,767
It would not be what his heart most
desired: there would be the “public eye

2039
01:58:32,767 --> 01:58:36,433
and the talking of tongues”
⁠—but he could wait.

2040
01:58:36,433 --> 01:58:39,860
The hour would come when he could be
alone with his bride at last.

2041
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:43,064
And so he spoke as if he urged it.

2042
01:58:43,064 --> 01:58:43,891
“Never!”

2043
01:58:43,891 --> 01:58:44,872
she cried.

2044
01:58:44,872 --> 01:58:46,610
“Never, never!”

2045
01:58:46,610 --> 01:58:47,962
She pushed it from her.

2046
01:58:47,962 --> 01:58:51,092
She would not brook such
sacrifice on his part.

2047
01:58:51,092 --> 01:58:54,254
Were they not going to her
mother in four weeks?

2048
01:58:54,254 --> 01:58:58,984
If her family had warmly accepted him⁠—
but they had not; and in any case,

2049
01:58:58,984 --> 01:59:01,407
it had gone too far, it was too late.

2050
01:59:01,407 --> 01:59:05,327
She told her lover that she would not
hear him, that if he said any more she

2051
01:59:05,327 --> 01:59:08,485
would gallop into town
separately from him.

2052
01:59:08,485 --> 01:59:13,966
And for his sake she would hide deep from
him this loneliness of hers,

2053
01:59:13,966 --> 01:59:18,632
and the hurt that he had given her in
refusing to share with her his trouble

2054
01:59:18,632 --> 01:59:21,711
with Trampas, when others
must know of it.

2055
01:59:21,711 --> 01:59:26,757
Accordingly, they descended the hill
slowly together, lingering to spin out

2056
01:59:26,757 --> 01:59:28,357
these last miles long.

2057
01:59:28,357 --> 01:59:32,994
Many rides had taught their horses to go
side by side, and so they went now:

2058
01:59:32,994 --> 01:59:38,250
the girl sweet and thoughtful in her
sedate gray habit; and the man in his

2059
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:43,784
leathern chaps and cartridge belt and
flannel shirt, looking gravely into the

2060
01:59:43,784 --> 01:59:48,159
distance with the level
gaze of the frontier.

2061
01:59:48,159 --> 01:59:51,528
Having read his sweetheart’s mind very
plainly, the lover now

2062
01:59:51,528 --> 01:59:53,252
broke his dearest custom.

2063
01:59:53,252 --> 01:59:58,179
It was his code never to speak ill of any
man to any woman.

2064
01:59:58,179 --> 02:00:01,322
Men’s quarrels were not for women’s ears.

2065
02:00:01,322 --> 02:00:05,663
In his scheme, good women were to know
only a fragment of men’s lives.

2066
02:00:05,663 --> 02:00:10,664
He had lived many outlaw years,
and his wide knowledge of evil made

2067
02:00:10,664 --> 02:00:12,777
innocence doubly precious to him.

2068
02:00:12,777 --> 02:00:17,201
But today he must depart from his code,
having read her mind well.

2069
02:00:17,201 --> 02:00:22,024
He would speak evil of one man to one
woman, because his reticence had hurt

2070
02:00:22,024 --> 02:00:26,572
her⁠—and was she not far from her
mother, and very lonely,

2071
02:00:26,572 --> 02:00:27,479
do what he could?

2072
02:00:27,479 --> 02:00:33,255
She should know the story of his quarrel
in language as light and casual as he

2073
02:00:33,255 --> 02:00:34,458
could veil it with.

2074
02:00:34,458 --> 02:00:36,812
He made an oblique start.

2075
02:00:36,812 --> 02:00:39,698
He did not say to her:
“I’ll tell you about this.

2076
02:00:39,698 --> 02:00:43,002
You saw me get ready for Trampas because
I have been ready for him any

2077
02:00:43,002 --> 02:00:44,409
time these five years.”

2078
02:00:44,409 --> 02:00:49,127
He began far off from the point with that
rooted caution of his⁠—that caution

2079
02:00:49,127 --> 02:00:52,249
which is shared by the primal savage
and the perfected diplomat.

2080
02:00:52,249 --> 02:00:55,727
“There’s cert’nly a right smart o’
difference between men

2081
02:00:55,727 --> 02:00:57,171
and women,” he observed.

2082
02:00:57,171 --> 02:00:58,607
“You’re quite sure?”

2083
02:00:58,607 --> 02:00:59,540
she retorted.

2084
02:00:59,540 --> 02:01:02,277
“Ain’t it fortunate?⁠—that
there’s both, I mean.”

2085
02:01:02,277 --> 02:01:04,037
“I don’t know about fortunate.

2086
02:01:04,037 --> 02:01:08,077
Machinery could probably do all the heavy
work for us without your help.”

2087
02:01:08,077 --> 02:01:10,949
“And who’d invent the machinery?”

2088
02:01:10,949 --> 02:01:11,589
She laughed.

2089
02:01:11,589 --> 02:01:15,069
“We shouldn’t need the huge,
noisy things you do.

2090
02:01:15,069 --> 02:01:17,301
Our world would be a gentle one.”

2091
02:01:17,301 --> 02:01:19,097
“Oh, my gracious!”

2092
02:01:19,097 --> 02:01:20,753
“What do you mean by that?”

2093
02:01:20,753 --> 02:01:21,997
“Oh, my gracious!

2094
02:01:21,997 --> 02:01:23,356
Get along, Monte!

2095
02:01:23,356 --> 02:01:26,101
A gentle world all full of ladies!”

2096
02:01:26,101 --> 02:01:27,661
“Do you call men gentle?”

2097
02:01:27,661 --> 02:01:28,887
inquired Molly.

2098
02:01:28,887 --> 02:01:30,539
“Now it’s a funny thing about that.

2099
02:01:30,539 --> 02:01:33,962
Have yu’ ever noticed a joke
about fathers-in-law?

2100
02:01:33,962 --> 02:01:40,350
There’s just as many fathers⁠—as mothers-
in-law; but which side are your jokes?”

2101
02:01:40,350 --> 02:01:42,149
Molly was not vanquished.

2102
02:01:42,149 --> 02:01:45,481
“That’s because the men write the
comic papers,” said she.

2103
02:01:45,481 --> 02:01:46,867
“Hear that, Monte?

2104
02:01:46,867 --> 02:01:48,147
The men write ’em.

2105
02:01:48,147 --> 02:01:52,458
Well, if the ladies wrote a comic paper,
I expect that might be gentle.”

2106
02:01:52,458 --> -1:59:59,000
She gave up this battle in
mirth; and he resumed:⁠

2107
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
—

2108
02:01:55,435 --> 02:01:58,635
“But don’t you really reckon it’s
uncommon to meet a father-in-law

2109
02:01:58,635 --> 02:02:00,195
flouncin’ around the house?

2110
02:02:00,195 --> 02:02:06,451
As for gentle⁠—Once I had to sleep in a
room next a ladies’ temperance meetin’.

2111
02:02:06,451 --> 02:02:07,943
Oh, heavens!

2112
02:02:07,943 --> 02:02:12,791
Well, I couldn’t change my room,
and the hotel man, he apologized

2113
02:02:12,791 --> 02:02:14,438
to me next mawnin’.

2114
02:02:14,438 --> 02:02:17,483
Said it didn’t surprise him
the husbands drank some.”

2115
02:02:17,483 --> 02:02:21,904
Here the Virginian broke down over his
own fantastic inventions,

2116
02:02:21,904 --> 02:02:24,870
and gave a joyous chuckle in
company with his sweetheart.

2117
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:31,022
“Yes, there’s a big heap o’ difference
between men and women,” he said.

2118
02:02:31,022 --> 02:02:33,448
“Take that fello’ and myself, now.”

2119
02:02:33,448 --> 02:02:34,417
“Trampas?”

2120
02:02:34,417 --> 02:02:37,261
said Molly, quickly serious.

2121
02:02:37,261 --> 02:02:41,773
She looked along the road ahead,
and discerned the figure of Trampas

2122
02:02:41,773 --> 02:02:44,548
still visible on its way to town.

2123
02:02:44,548 --> 02:02:48,757
The Virginian did not wish her to be
serious⁠—more than could be helped.

2124
02:02:48,757 --> 02:02:53,296
“Why, yes,” he replied,
with a waving gesture at Trampas.

2125
02:02:53,296 --> 02:02:54,809
“Take him and me.

2126
02:02:54,809 --> 02:02:56,697
He don’t think much o’ me!

2127
02:02:56,697 --> 02:02:58,314
How could he?

2128
02:02:58,314 --> 02:03:00,123
And I expect he’ll never.

2129
02:03:00,123 --> 02:03:03,294
But yu’ saw just now how
it was between us.

2130
02:03:03,294 --> 02:03:05,576
We were not a bit like
a temperance meetin’.”

2131
02:03:05,576 --> 02:03:08,992
She could not help laughing at the twist
he gave to his voice.

2132
02:03:08,992 --> 02:03:12,703
And she felt happiness warming her;
for in the Virginian’s tone about

2133
02:03:12,703 --> 02:03:16,809
Trampas was something now that
no longer excluded her.

2134
02:03:16,809 --> 02:03:21,936
Thus he began his gradual recital,
in a cadence always easy,

2135
02:03:21,936 --> 02:03:25,219
and more and more musical with the
native accent of the South.

2136
02:03:25,219 --> 02:03:30,448
With the light turn he gave it,
its pure ugliness melted into charm.

2137
02:03:30,448 --> 02:03:33,128
“No, he don’t think anything of me.

2138
02:03:33,128 --> 02:03:37,448
Once a man in the John Day Valley didn’t
think much, and by Cañada de

2139
02:03:37,448 --> 02:03:39,823
Oro I met another.

2140
02:03:39,823 --> 02:03:43,923
It will always be so here and there,
but Trampas beats ’em all.

2141
02:03:43,923 --> 02:03:47,901
For the others have always expressed
themselves⁠—got shut of their poor

2142
02:03:47,901 --> 02:03:49,233
opinion in the open air.”

2143
02:03:49,233 --> 02:03:54,775
“Yu’ see, I had to explain myself to
Trampas a right smart while ago,

2144
02:03:54,775 --> 02:03:57,535
long before ever I laid my eyes on yu’.

2145
02:03:57,535 --> 02:04:00,027
It was just nothing at all.

2146
02:04:00,027 --> 02:04:04,147
A little matter of cyards in the days
when I was apt to spend my money and

2147
02:04:04,147 --> 02:04:06,608
my holidays pretty headlong.

2148
02:04:06,608 --> 02:04:11,943
My gracious, what nonsensical
times I have had!

2149
02:04:11,943 --> 02:04:19,042
But I was apt to win at
cyards, ’specially poker.

2150
02:04:19,042 --> 02:04:23,477
And Trampas, he met me one night,
and I expect he must have thought I

2151
02:04:23,477 --> 02:04:24,978
looked kind o’ young.

2152
02:04:24,978 --> 02:04:30,079
So he hated losin’ his money to such a
young-lookin’ man, and he took his way

2153
02:04:30,079 --> 02:04:31,621
of sayin’ as much.

2154
02:04:31,621 --> 02:04:36,254
I had to explain myself to him plainly,
so that he learned right away my age

2155
02:04:36,254 --> 02:04:37,344
had got its growth.

2156
02:04:37,344 --> 02:04:42,013
“Well, I expect he hated that worse,
having to receive my explanation with

2157
02:04:42,013 --> 02:04:47,366
folks lookin’ on at us publicly that-a-
way, and him without further ideas

2158
02:04:47,366 --> 02:04:49,133
occurrin’ to him at the moment.

2159
02:04:49,133 --> 02:04:54,538
That’s what started his poor opinion of
me, not havin’ ideas at the moment.

2160
02:04:54,538 --> 02:04:58,660
And so the boys resumed their cyards.

2161
02:04:58,660 --> 02:05:00,177
“I’d most forgot about it.

2162
02:05:00,177 --> 02:05:03,872
But Trampas’s mem’ry is one
of his strong points.

2163
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:09,074
Next thing⁠—oh, it’s a good while later⁠—
he gets to losin’ flesh because Judge

2164
02:05:09,074 --> 02:05:12,867
Henry gave me charge of him and some
other punchers taking cattle⁠—”

2165
02:05:12,867 --> 02:05:16,019
“That’s not next,” interrupted the girl.

2166
02:05:16,019 --> 02:05:17,125
“Not?

2167
02:05:17,125 --> 02:05:17,991
Why⁠—”

2168
02:05:17,991 --> 02:05:19,238
“Don’t you remember?”

2169
02:05:19,238 --> 02:05:22,705
she said, timid, yet eager.

2170
02:05:22,705 --> 02:05:23,495
“Don’t you?”

2171
02:05:23,495 --> 02:05:24,868
“Blamed if I do!”

2172
02:05:24,868 --> 02:05:26,086
“The first time we met?”

2173
02:05:26,086 --> 02:05:29,835
“Yes; my mem’ry keeps that⁠—
like I keep this.”

2174
02:05:29,835 --> 02:05:33,675
And he brought from his pocket her own
handkerchief, the token he had picked up

2175
02:05:33,675 --> 02:05:40,035
at a river’s brink when he had carried
her from an overturned stage.

2176
02:05:40,035 --> 02:05:45,226
“We did not exactly meet, then,” she said.

2177
02:05:45,226 --> 02:05:48,067
“It was at that dance.

2178
02:05:48,067 --> 02:05:51,778
I hadn’t seen you yet;
but Trampas was saying something horrid

2179
02:05:51,778 --> 02:05:58,253
about me, and you said⁠—you said,
‘Rise on your legs, you pole cat,

2180
02:05:58,253 --> 02:05:59,561
and tell them you’re a liar.’

2181
02:05:59,561 --> 02:06:03,468
When I heard that, I think⁠—I
think it finished me.”

2182
02:06:03,468 --> 02:06:09,555
And crimson suffused Molly’s countenance.

2183
02:06:10,015 --> 02:06:13,200
“I’d forgot,” the Virginian murmured.

2184
02:06:13,200 --> -1:59:59,000
Then sharply, “How did you hear it?

2185
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2186
02:06:15,571 --> 02:06:16,316
“Mrs.

2187
02:06:16,316 --> 02:06:17,209
Taylor⁠—”

2188
02:06:17,209 --> 02:06:17,752
“Oh!

2189
02:06:17,752 --> 02:06:20,946
Well, a man would never have
told a woman that.”

2190
02:06:20,946 --> 02:06:22,956
Molly laughed triumphantly.

2191
02:06:22,956 --> 02:06:25,516
“Then who told Mrs. Taylor?”

2192
02:06:25,516 --> 02:06:27,556
Being caught, he grinned at her.

2193
02:06:27,556 --> 02:06:32,385
“I reckon husbands are a special kind of
man,” was all that he found to say.

2194
02:06:32,385 --> 02:06:36,890
“Well, since you do know about that,
it was the next move in the game.

2195
02:06:36,890 --> 02:06:40,999
Trampas thought I had no call to stop him
sayin’ what he pleased about a woman who

2196
02:06:40,999 --> 02:06:42,970
was nothin’ to me⁠—then.

2197
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:46,214
But all women ought to be
somethin’ to a man.

2198
02:06:46,214 --> 02:06:49,917
So I had to give Trampas another
explanation in the presence of folks

2199
02:06:49,917 --> 02:06:54,221
lookin’ on, and it was
just like the cyards.

2200
02:06:54,221 --> 02:06:56,182
No ideas occurred to him again.

2201
02:06:56,182 --> 02:06:59,476
And down goes his opinion of me some more!

2202
02:06:59,476 --> 02:07:01,801
“Well, I have not been able to raise it.

2203
02:07:01,801 --> 02:07:06,774
There has been this and that and the
other⁠—yu’ know most of the later doings

2204
02:07:06,774 --> 02:07:10,894
yourself⁠—and today is the first time
I’ve happened to see the man since

2205
02:07:10,894 --> 02:07:12,534
the doings last autumn.

2206
02:07:12,534 --> 02:07:14,883
Yu’ seem to know about them, too.

2207
02:07:14,883 --> 02:07:19,397
He knows I can’t prove he was with that
gang of horse thieves.

2208
02:07:19,397 --> 02:07:22,270
And I can’t prove he killed poor Shorty.

2209
02:07:22,270 --> 02:07:26,951
But he knows I missed him awful close,
and spoiled his thieving for a while.

2210
02:07:26,951 --> 02:07:29,808
So d’ yu’ wonder he don’t
think much of me?

2211
02:07:29,808 --> 02:07:33,201
But if I had lived to be twenty-nine
years old like I am,

2212
02:07:33,201 --> 02:07:37,640
and with all my chances made no enemy,
I’d feel myself a failure.”

2213
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:39,587
His story was finished.

2214
02:07:39,587 --> 02:07:44,384
He had made her his confidant in matters
he had never spoken of before,

2215
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:46,899
and she was happy to be thus
much nearer to him.

2216
02:07:46,899 --> 02:07:50,819
It diminished a certain fear that was
mingled with her love of him.

2217
02:07:50,819 --> 02:07:54,319
During the next several miles he was
silent, and his silence

2218
02:07:54,319 --> 02:07:55,479
was enough for her.

2219
02:07:55,479 --> 02:08:01,013
Vermont sank away from her thoughts,
and Wyoming held less of loneliness.

2220
02:08:01,013 --> 02:08:05,430
They descended altogether into the map
which had stretched below them,

2221
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:09,507
so that it was a map no longer,
but earth with growing things,

2222
02:08:09,507 --> 02:08:14,917
and prairie-dogs sitting upon it,
and now and then a bird flying over it.

2223
02:08:14,917 --> 02:08:17,947
And after a while she said to him,
“What are you thinking about?”

2224
02:08:17,947 --> 02:08:20,010
“I have been doing sums.

2225
02:08:20,010 --> 02:08:23,574
Figured in hours it sounds right short.

2226
02:08:23,574 --> 02:08:28,182
Figured in minutes it boils up
into quite a mess.

2227
02:08:28,182 --> 02:08:31,735
Twenty by sixty is twelve hundred.

2228
02:08:31,735 --> 02:08:35,924
Put that into seconds,
and yu’ get seventy-two thousand

2229
02:08:35,924 --> 02:08:36,935
seconds.

2230
02:08:36,935 --> 02:08:39,044
Seventy-two thousand.

2231
02:08:39,044 --> 02:08:42,995
Seventy-two thousand seconds yet
before we get married.”

2232
02:08:42,995 --> 02:08:44,296
“Seconds!

2233
02:08:44,296 --> 02:08:47,258
To think of its having come to seconds!”

2234
02:08:47,258 --> 02:08:49,228
“I am thinkin’ about it.

2235
02:08:49,228 --> 02:08:52,471
I’m choppin’ sixty of
’em off every minute.”

2236
02:08:52,471 --> 02:08:54,701
With such chopping time wears away.

2237
02:08:54,701 --> 02:08:59,141
More miles of the road lay behind them,
and in the virgin wilderness the scars

2238
02:08:59,141 --> 02:09:04,301
of new-scraped water ditches began to
appear, and the first wire fences.

2239
02:09:04,301 --> 02:09:07,641
Next, they were passing cabins and
occasional fields, the

2240
02:09:07,641 --> 02:09:09,373
outposts of habitation.

2241
02:09:09,373 --> 02:09:13,163
The free road became wholly imprisoned,
running between unbroken

2242
02:09:13,163 --> 02:09:14,925
stretches of barbed wire.

2243
02:09:14,925 --> 02:09:21,108
Far off to the eastward a flowing column
of dust marked the approaching stage,

2244
02:09:21,108 --> 02:09:25,664
bringing the bishop,
probably, for whose visit here they

2245
02:09:25,664 --> 02:09:26,997
had timed their wedding.

2246
02:09:26,997 --> 02:09:32,095
The day still brimmed with heat and
sunshine; but the great daily shadow was

2247
02:09:32,095 --> 02:09:36,000
beginning to move from the feet of the
Bow Leg Mountains outward

2248
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:36,900
toward the town.

2249
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:39,439
Presently they began to meet citizens.

2250
02:09:39,439 --> 02:09:44,892
Some of these knew them and nodded,
while some did not, and stared.

2251
02:09:44,892 --> 02:09:50,854
Turning a corner into the town’s chief
street, where stood the hotel,

2252
02:09:50,854 --> 02:09:55,211
the bank, the drug store,
the general store, and the seven

2253
02:09:55,211 --> 02:09:56,749
saloons, they were hailed heartily.

2254
02:09:56,749 --> 02:10:01,754
Here were three friends⁠—Honey Wiggin,
Scipio Le Moyne, and Lin McLean⁠—all

2255
02:10:01,754 --> 02:10:06,441
desirous of drinking the Virginian’s
health, if his lady⁠—would she mind?

2256
02:10:06,441 --> 02:10:08,556
The three stood grinning,
with their hats off;

2257
02:10:08,556 --> 02:10:12,863
but behind their gaiety the Virginian
read some other purpose.

2258
02:10:12,863 --> 02:10:15,759
“We’ll all be very good,”
said Honey Wiggin.

2259
02:10:15,759 --> 02:10:17,601
“Pretty good,” said Lin.

2260
02:10:17,601 --> 02:10:19,344
“Good,” said Scipio.

2261
02:10:19,344 --> 02:10:20,926
“Which is the honest man?”

2262
02:10:20,926 --> 02:10:23,520
inquired Molly, glad to see them.

2263
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:24,540
“Not one!”

2264
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:26,231
said the Virginian.

2265
02:10:26,231 --> 02:10:29,271
“My old friends scare me when I
think of their ways.”

2266
02:10:29,271 --> 02:10:33,144
“It’s bein’ engaged scares
yu’,” retorted Mr. McLean.

2267
02:10:33,144 --> 02:10:37,409
“Marriage restores your courage, I find.”

2268
02:10:37,409 --> 02:10:40,341
“Well, I’ll trust all of you,” said Molly.

2269
02:10:40,341 --> 02:10:44,460
“He’s going to take me to the hotel,
and then you can drink his health as

2270
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:45,860
much as you please.”

2271
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:50,221
With a smile to them she turned to
proceed, and he let his horse move with

2272
02:10:50,221 --> 02:10:51,989
hers; but he looked at his friends.

2273
02:10:51,989 --> 02:10:58,208
Then Scipio’s bleached blue eyes narrowed
to a slit, and he said what they had all

2274
02:10:58,208 --> 02:10:59,922
come out on the street to say:⁠—

2275
02:10:59,922 --> 02:11:02,484
“Don’t change your clothes.”

2276
02:11:02,484 --> 02:11:03,462
“Oh!”

2277
02:11:03,462 --> 02:11:11,075
protested Molly, “isn’t he
rather dusty and countrified?”

2278
02:11:11,075 --> 02:11:15,296
But the Virginian had
taken Scipio’s meaning.

2279
02:11:15,296 --> 02:11:18,063
“Don’t change your clothes.”

2280
02:11:18,063 --> 02:11:23,708
Innocent Molly appreciated these words no
more than the average reader who reads a

2281
02:11:23,708 --> 02:11:28,430
masterpiece, complacently unaware that
its style differs from that

2282
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:29,377
of the morning paper.

2283
02:11:29,377 --> 02:11:34,372
Such was Scipio’s intention,
wishing to spare her from alarm.

2284
02:11:34,372 --> 02:11:39,860
So at the hotel she let her lover go with
a kiss, and without a thought of

2285
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:40,720
Trampas.

2286
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:46,271
She in her room unlocked the possessions
which were there waiting for her,

2287
02:11:46,271 --> 02:11:47,710
and changed her dress.

2288
02:11:47,710 --> 02:11:52,641
Wedding garments, and other civilized
apparel proper for a genuine

2289
02:11:52,641 --> 02:11:56,803
frontiersman when he comes to town,
were also in the hotel,

2290
02:11:56,803 --> 02:11:58,586
ready for the Virginian to wear.

2291
02:11:58,586 --> 02:12:03,162
It is only the somewhat green and
unseasoned cowpuncher who struts before

2292
02:12:03,162 --> 02:12:06,048
the public in spurs and deadly weapons.

2293
02:12:06,048 --> 02:12:11,558
For many a year the Virginian had put
away these childish things.

2294
02:12:11,558 --> 02:12:14,439
He made a sober toilet for the streets.

2295
02:12:14,439 --> 02:12:18,628
Nothing but his face and bearing remained
out of the common when he was in a town.

2296
02:12:18,628 --> 02:12:24,798
But Scipio had told him not to change his
clothes; therefore he went out with his

2297
02:12:24,798 --> 02:12:25,911
pistol at his hip.

2298
02:12:25,911 --> 02:12:29,956
Soon he had joined his three friends.

2299
02:12:29,956 --> 02:12:32,396
“I’m obliged to yu’,” he said.

2300
02:12:32,396 --> 02:12:34,535
“He passed me this mawnin’.”

2301
02:12:34,535 --> 02:12:37,459
“We don’t know his intentions,”
said Wiggin.

2302
02:12:37,459 --> 02:12:40,469
“Except that he’s hangin’
around,” said McLean.

2303
02:12:40,469 --> 02:12:43,458
“And fillin’ up,” said
Scipio, “which reminds me⁠—”

2304
02:12:43,458 --> 02:12:47,911
They strolled into the saloon of a
friend, where, unfortunately,

2305
02:12:47,911 --> 02:12:49,276
sat some foolish people.

2306
02:12:49,276 --> 02:12:54,222
But one cannot always tell how much of a
fool a man is, at sight.

2307
02:12:54,222 --> 02:12:57,136
It was a temperate health-
drinking that they made.

2308
02:12:57,136 --> 02:13:02,466
“Here’s how,” they muttered softly to the
Virginian; and “How,”

2309
02:13:02,466 --> 02:13:05,256
he returned softly, looking
away from them.

2310
02:13:05,256 --> 02:13:10,157
But they had a brief meeting of eyes,
standing and lounging near each other,

2311
02:13:10,157 --> 02:13:13,271
shyly; and Scipio shook
hands with the bridegroom.

2312
02:13:13,271 --> 02:13:17,384
“Some day,” he stated,
tapping himself; for in his vagrant

2313
02:13:17,384 --> 02:13:22,734
heart he began to envy the man who could
bring himself to marry.

2314
02:13:22,734 --> 02:13:26,080
And he nodded again, repeating,
“Here’s how.”

2315
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:30,307
They stood at the bar,
full of sentiment, empty of words,

2316
02:13:30,307 --> 02:13:33,305
memory and affection
busy in their hearts.

2317
02:13:33,305 --> 02:13:38,625
All of them had seen rough days together,
and they felt guilty with emotion.

2318
02:13:38,625 --> 02:13:40,848
“It’s hot weather,” said Wiggin.

2319
02:13:40,848 --> 02:13:44,162
“Hotter on Box Elder,” said McLean.

2320
02:13:44,162 --> 02:13:46,258
“My kid has started teething.”

2321
02:13:46,258 --> 02:13:48,217
Words ran dry again.

2322
02:13:48,217 --> 02:13:51,941
They shifted their positions,
looked in their glasses,

2323
02:13:51,941 --> 02:13:53,618
read the labels on the bottles.

2324
02:13:53,618 --> 02:13:57,157
They dropped a word now and then to the
proprietor about his

2325
02:13:57,157 --> 02:13:59,257
trade, and his ornaments.

2326
02:13:59,257 --> 02:14:00,903
“Good head

2327
02:14:00,903 --> 02:14:03,251
,” commented McLean.

2328
02:14:03,251 --> 02:14:06,351
“Big old ram,” assented the proprietor.

2329
02:14:06,351 --> 02:14:10,082
“Shot him myself on Gray Bull last fall.”

2330
02:14:10,082 --> 02:14:14,301
“Sheep was thick in the Tetons last
fall,” said the Virginian.

2331
02:14:14,301 --> 02:14:20,794
On the bar stood a machine into which the
idle customer might drop his nickel.

2332
02:14:20,794 --> 02:14:24,642
The coin then bounced among an
arrangement of pegs,

2333
02:14:24,642 --> 02:14:29,175
descending at length into one or
another of various holes.

2334
02:14:29,175 --> 02:14:33,732
You might win as much as ten times your
stake, but this was not the most usual

2335
02:14:33,732 --> 02:14:38,753
result; and with nickels the three
friends and the bridegroom now mildly

2336
02:14:38,753 --> 02:14:41,494
sported for a while,
buying them with silver when

2337
02:14:41,494 --> 02:14:42,594
their store ran out.

2338
02:14:42,594 --> 02:14:45,787
“Was it sheep you went
after in the Tetons?”

2339
02:14:45,787 --> 02:14:50,410
inquired the proprietor,
knowing it was horse thieves.

2340
02:14:50,410 --> 02:14:53,444
“Yes,” said the Virginian.

2341
02:14:53,444 --> 02:14:55,040
“I’ll have ten more nickels.”

2342
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:56,722
“Did you get all the sheep you wanted?”

2343
02:14:56,722 --> 02:14:58,052
the proprietor continued.

2344
02:14:58,052 --> 02:15:00,828
“Poor luck,” said the Virginian.

2345
02:15:00,828 --> 02:15:05,075
“Think there’s a friend of yours in town
this afternoon,” said the proprietor.

2346
02:15:05,075 --> 02:15:06,889
“Did he mention he was my friend?”

2347
02:15:06,889 --> 02:15:08,270
The proprietor laughed.

2348
02:15:08,270 --> 02:15:12,735
The Virginian watched another nickel
click down among the pegs.

2349
02:15:12,735 --> 02:15:16,341
Honey Wiggin now made the
bridegroom a straight offer.

2350
02:15:16,341 --> 02:15:19,852
“We’ll take this thing off
your hands,” said he.

2351
02:15:19,852 --> 02:15:23,629
“Any or all of us,” said Lin.

2352
02:15:23,629 --> 02:15:27,020
But Scipio held his peace.

2353
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:31,262
His loyalty went every inch as far as
theirs, but his understanding of

2354
02:15:31,262 --> 02:15:33,351
his friend went deeper.

2355
02:15:33,351 --> 02:15:38,476
“Don’t change your clothes,”
was the first and the last help he would

2356
02:15:38,476 --> 02:15:40,326
be likely to give in this matter.

2357
02:15:40,326 --> 02:15:46,716
The rest must be as such matters must
always be, between man and man.

2358
02:15:46,716 --> 02:15:49,903
To the other two friends,
however, this seemed a very special

2359
02:15:49,903 --> 02:15:53,036
case, falling outside
established precedent.

2360
02:15:53,036 --> 02:15:57,122
Therefore they ventured
offers of interference.

2361
02:15:57,122 --> 02:16:01,322
“A man don’t get married
every day,” apologized McLean.

2362
02:16:01,322 --> 02:16:03,380
“We’ll just run him out of town for yu’.”

2363
02:16:03,380 --> 02:16:06,315
“Save yu’ the trouble,” urged Wiggin.

2364
02:16:06,315 --> 02:16:07,840
“Say the word.”

2365
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:10,334
The proprietor now added his voice.

2366
02:16:10,334 --> 02:16:13,784
“It’ll sober him up to spend his night
out in the brush.

2367
02:16:13,784 --> -1:59:59,000
He’ll quit his talk then.

2368
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2369
02:16:15,014 --> 02:16:18,696
But the Virginian did not say the
word, or any word.

2370
02:16:18,696 --> 02:16:20,547
He stood playing with the nickels.

2371
02:16:20,547 --> 02:16:23,823
“Think of her,” muttered McLean.

2372
02:16:23,823 --> 02:16:26,156
“Who else would I be thinking of?”

2373
02:16:26,156 --> 02:16:27,245
returned the Southerner.

2374
02:16:27,245 --> 02:16:29,861
His face had become very sombre.

2375
02:16:29,861 --> 02:16:32,419
“She has been raised so different!”

2376
02:16:32,419 --> 02:16:33,577
he murmured.

2377
02:16:33,577 --> 02:16:38,286
He pondered a little,
while the others waited, solicitous.

2378
02:16:38,286 --> 02:16:40,845
A new idea came to the proprietor.

2379
02:16:40,845 --> 02:16:43,621
“I am acting mayor of this town,” said he.

2380
02:16:43,621 --> 02:16:46,590
“I’ll put him in the calaboose and keep
him till you get married and away.”

2381
02:16:46,590 --> 02:16:48,866
“Say the word,” repeated Honey Wiggin.

2382
02:16:48,866 --> 02:16:52,621
Scipio’s eye met the proprietor’s,
and he shook his head about a

2383
02:16:52,621 --> 02:16:53,785
quarter of an inch.

2384
02:16:53,785 --> 02:16:57,043
The proprietor shook his
to the same amount.

2385
02:16:57,043 --> 02:16:58,643
They understood each other.

2386
02:16:58,643 --> 02:17:03,213
It had come to that point where there was
no way out, save only the ancient,

2387
02:17:03,213 --> 02:17:06,614
eternal way between man and man.

2388
02:17:06,614 --> 02:17:13,169
It is only the great mediocrity that goes
to law in these personal matters.

2389
02:17:13,169 --> 02:17:15,969
“So he has talked about me some?”

2390
02:17:15,969 --> 02:17:16,800
said the Virginian.

2391
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:19,662
“It’s the whiskey,” Scipio explained.

2392
02:17:19,662 --> 02:17:24,051
“I expect,” said McLean,
“he’d run a mile if he was in a state

2393
02:17:24,051 --> 02:17:26,958
to appreciate his insinuations.”

2394
02:17:26,958 --> 02:17:30,752
“Which we are careful not to mention to
yu’,” said Wiggin, “unless

2395
02:17:30,752 --> 02:17:32,162
yu’ inquire for ’em.”

2396
02:17:32,162 --> 02:17:35,680
Some of the fools present had drawn
closer to hear this interesting

2397
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:37,251
conversation.

2398
02:17:37,251 --> 02:17:42,193
In gatherings of more than six there will
generally be at least one fool;

2399
02:17:42,193 --> 02:17:44,808
and this company must
have numbered twenty men.

2400
02:17:44,808 --> 02:17:48,998
“This country knows well enough,”
said one fool, who hungered to be

2401
02:17:48,998 --> 02:17:52,614
important, “that you don’t brand no
calves that ain’t your own.”

2402
02:17:52,614 --> 02:17:54,644
The saturnine Virginian looked at him.

2403
02:17:54,644 --> 02:17:57,789
“Thank yu’,” said he,
gravely, “for your endorsement

2404
02:17:57,789 --> 02:17:59,529
of my character.”

2405
02:17:59,529 --> 02:18:01,529
The fool felt flattered.

2406
02:18:01,529 --> 02:18:04,085
The Virginian turned to his friends.

2407
02:18:04,085 --> 02:18:09,281
His hand slowly pushed his hat back,
and he rubbed his black head in thought.

2408
02:18:09,281 --> 02:18:13,786
“Glad to see yu’ve got your gun with
you,” continued the happy fool.

2409
02:18:13,786 --> 02:18:18,742
“You know what Trampas claims about that
affair of yours in the Tetons?

2410
02:18:18,742 --> 02:18:22,357
He claims that if everything was known
about the killing of Shorty⁠—”

2411
02:18:22,357 --> 02:18:26,749
“Take one on the house,”
suggested the proprietor to him,

2412
02:18:26,749 --> 02:18:27,583
amiably.

2413
02:18:27,583 --> 02:18:29,773
“Your news will be fresher.”

2414
02:18:29,773 --> 02:18:31,252
And he pushed him the bottle.

2415
02:18:31,252 --> 02:18:35,243
The fool felt less important.

2416
02:18:35,243 --> 02:18:38,993
“This talk had went the rounds before it
got to us,” said Scipio,

2417
02:18:38,993 --> 02:18:40,708
“or we’d have headed it off.

2418
02:18:40,708 --> 02:18:43,068
He has got friends in town.”

2419
02:18:43,068 --> 02:18:47,036
Perplexity knotted the Virginian’s brows.

2420
02:18:47,036 --> 02:18:51,651
This community knew that a man had
implied he was a thief and a murderer;

2421
02:18:51,651 --> 02:18:53,488
it also knew that he knew it.

2422
02:18:53,488 --> 02:18:58,514
But the case was one of
peculiar circumstances, assuredly.

2423
02:18:58,514 --> 02:19:00,504
Could he avoid meeting the man?

2424
02:19:00,504 --> 02:19:04,600
Soon the stage would be starting
south for the railroad.

2425
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:08,681
He had already today proposed to his
sweetheart that they should take it.

2426
02:19:08,681 --> 02:19:13,309
Could he for her sake leave unanswered a
talking enemy upon the field?

2427
02:19:13,309 --> 02:19:15,374
His own ears had not heard the enemy.

2428
02:19:15,374 --> 02:19:18,888
Into these reflections the
fool stepped once more.

2429
02:19:18,888 --> 02:19:24,748
“Of course this country don’t
believe Trampas,” said he.

2430
02:19:24,748 --> 02:19:25,788
“This country⁠—”

2431
02:19:25,788 --> 02:19:28,619
But he contributed no further thoughts.

2432
02:19:28,619 --> 02:19:32,135
From somewhere in the rear of the
building, where it opened upon the tin

2433
02:19:32,135 --> 02:19:36,097
cans and the hinder purlieus of the
town, came a movement,

2434
02:19:36,097 --> 02:19:39,338
and Trampas was among
them, courageous with whiskey.

2435
02:19:39,338 --> 02:19:43,528
All the fools now made
themselves conspicuous.

2436
02:19:43,528 --> 02:19:47,493
One lay on the floor,
knocked there by the Virginian,

2437
02:19:47,493 --> 02:19:49,937
whose arm he had attempted to hold.

2438
02:19:49,937 --> 02:19:53,696
Others struggled with Trampas,
and his bullet smashed the ceiling

2439
02:19:53,696 --> 02:19:55,589
before they could drag
the pistol from him.

2440
02:19:55,589 --> 02:19:56,547
“There now!

2441
02:19:56,547 --> 02:19:58,195
there now!”

2442
02:19:58,195 --> 02:20:02,940
they interposed; “you don’t want to talk
like that,” for he was pouring out a

2443
02:20:02,940 --> 02:20:05,682
tide of hate and vilification.

2444
02:20:05,682 --> 02:20:09,963
Yet the Virginian stood quiet by the bar,
and many an eye of astonishment

2445
02:20:09,963 --> 02:20:11,293
was turned upon him.

2446
02:20:11,293 --> 02:20:15,303
“I’d not stand half that language,”
some muttered to each other.

2447
02:20:15,303 --> 02:20:21,184
Still the Virginian waited quietly,
while the fools reasoned with Trampas.

2448
02:20:21,184 --> 02:20:25,304
But no earthly foot can step between a
man and his destiny.

2449
02:20:25,304 --> 02:20:27,989
Trampas broke suddenly free.

2450
02:20:27,989 --> 02:20:33,754
“Your friends have saved your life,”
he rang out, with obscene epithets.

2451
02:20:33,754 --> 02:20:36,102
“I’ll give you till sundown
to leave town.”

2452
02:20:36,102 --> 02:20:38,206
There was total silence instantly.

2453
02:20:38,206 --> 02:20:42,922
“Trampas,” spoke the Virginian,
“I don’t want trouble with you.”

2454
02:20:42,922 --> 02:20:46,774
“He never has wanted it,”
Trampas sneered to the bystanders.

2455
02:20:46,774 --> 02:20:48,979
“He has been dodging it five years.

2456
02:20:48,979 --> 02:20:50,635
But I’ve got him coralled.”

2457
02:20:50,635 --> 02:20:53,243
Some of the Trampas faction smiled.

2458
02:20:53,243 --> 02:20:59,457
“Trampas,” said the Virginian again,
“are yu’ sure yu’ really mean that?”

2459
02:20:59,457 --> 02:21:05,853
The whiskey bottle flew through the air,
hurled by Trampas, and crashed through

2460
02:21:05,853 --> 02:21:08,684
the saloon window behind the Virginian.

2461
02:21:08,684 --> 02:21:12,969
“That was surplusage,
Trampas,” said he, “if

2462
02:21:12,969 --> 02:21:14,249
yu’ mean the other.”

2463
02:21:14,249 --> 02:21:17,570
“Get out by sundown, that’s
all,” said Trampas.

2464
02:21:17,570 --> 02:21:21,650
And wheeling, he went out of the saloon
by the rear, as he had entered.

2465
02:21:21,650 --> 02:21:25,594
“Gentlemen,” said the Virginian,
“I know you will all oblige me.”

2466
02:21:25,594 --> 02:21:26,514
“Sure!”

2467
02:21:26,514 --> 02:21:30,707
exclaimed the proprietor,
heartily, “We’ll see that everybody

2468
02:21:30,707 --> 02:21:32,315
lets this thing alone.”

2469
02:21:32,315 --> 02:21:37,592
The Virginian gave a general nod to the
company, and walked out into the street.

2470
02:21:37,592 --> 02:21:40,908
“It’s a turruble shame,”
sighed Scipio, “that he

2471
02:21:40,908 --> 02:21:42,864
couldn’t have postponed it.”

2472
02:21:42,864 --> 02:21:46,038
The Virginian walked in the open
air with thoughts disturbed.

2473
02:21:46,038 --> 02:21:49,853
“I am of two minds about one thing,”
he said to himself uneasily.

2474
02:21:49,853 --> 02:21:54,079
Gossip ran in advance of him;
but as he came by, the talk fell away

2475
02:21:54,079 --> 02:21:55,498
until he had passed.

2476
02:21:55,498 --> 02:22:00,029
Then they looked after him,
and their words again rose audibly.

2477
02:22:00,029 --> 02:22:04,402
Thus everywhere a little eddy of
silence accompanied his steps.

2478
02:22:04,402 --> 02:22:08,516
“It don’t trouble him much,”
one said, having read nothing

2479
02:22:08,516 --> 02:22:10,116
in the Virginian’s face.

2480
02:22:10,116 --> 02:22:13,088
“It may trouble his girl
some,” said another.

2481
02:22:13,088 --> 02:22:17,736
“She’ll not know,” said a
third, “until it’s over.”

2482
02:22:17,736 --> 02:22:19,576
“He’ll not tell her?”

2483
02:22:19,576 --> 02:22:21,166
“I wouldn’t.

2484
02:22:21,166 --> 02:22:22,729
It’s no woman’s business.”

2485
02:22:22,729 --> 02:22:23,868
“Maybe that’s so.

2486
02:22:23,868 --> 02:22:27,646
Well, it would have suited me to
have Trampas die sooner.”

2487
02:22:27,646 --> 02:22:30,167
“How would it suit you to
have him live longer?”

2488
02:22:30,167 --> 02:22:33,439
inquired a member of the opposite
faction, suspected of being

2489
02:22:33,439 --> 02:22:34,846
himself a cattle thief.

2490
02:22:34,846 --> 02:22:38,838
“I could answer your question,
if I had other folks’ calves

2491
02:22:38,838 --> 02:22:40,521
I wanted to brand.”

2492
02:22:40,521 --> 02:22:43,942
This raised both a laugh and a silence.

2493
02:22:43,942 --> 02:22:47,519
Thus the town talked,
filling in the time before sunset.

2494
02:22:47,519 --> 02:22:52,404
The Virginian, still walking aloof in the
open air, paused at the edge of the

2495
02:22:52,404 --> 02:22:52,942
town.

2496
02:22:52,942 --> 02:22:56,392
“I’d sooner have a sickness than be
undecided this way,”

2497
02:22:56,392 --> 02:22:58,780
he said, and he looked up and down.

2498
02:22:58,780 --> 02:23:01,938
Then a grim smile came at his own expense.

2499
02:23:01,938 --> 02:23:04,976
“I reckon it would make me sick⁠—
but there’s not time.”

2500
02:23:04,976 --> 02:23:09,509
Over there in the hotel sat his
sweetheart alone, away from her mother,

2501
02:23:09,509 --> 02:23:14,220
her friends, her home,
waiting his return, knowing nothing.

2502
02:23:14,220 --> 02:23:15,700
He looked into the west.

2503
02:23:15,700 --> 02:23:21,668
Between the sun and the bright ridges of
the mountains was still a space of sky;

2504
02:23:21,668 --> 02:23:26,772
but the shadow from the mountains’ feet
had drawn halfway toward the town.

2505
02:23:26,772 --> 02:23:29,889
“About forty minutes more,” he said aloud.

2506
02:23:29,889 --> 02:23:32,527
“She has been raised so different.”

2507
02:23:32,527 --> 02:23:34,450
And he sighed as he turned back.

2508
02:23:34,450 --> 02:23:39,191
As he went slowly, he did not know how
great was his own unhappiness.

2509
02:23:39,191 --> 02:23:43,567
“She has been raised so
different,” he said again.

2510
02:23:43,567 --> 02:23:48,752
Opposite the post-office the bishop of
Wyoming met him and greeted him.

2511
02:23:48,752 --> 02:23:55,190
His lonely heart throbbed at the warm,
firm grasp of this friend’s hand.

2512
02:23:55,190 --> 02:23:59,900
The bishop saw his eyes glow suddenly,
as if tears were close.

2513
02:23:59,900 --> -1:59:59,000
But none came, and no word more open
than, “I’m glad to see you.

2514
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2515
02:24:04,070 --> 02:24:08,939
But gossip had reached the bishop,
and he was sorely troubled also.

2516
02:24:08,939 --> 02:24:11,870
“What is all this?”

2517
02:24:11,870 --> 02:24:14,704
said he, coming straight to it.

2518
02:24:14,704 --> 02:24:18,572
The Virginian looked at
the clergyman frankly.

2519
02:24:18,572 --> 02:24:22,222
“Yu’ know just as much about it as
I do,” he said.

2520
02:24:22,222 --> 02:24:25,524
“And I’ll tell yu’ anything yu’ ask.”

2521
02:24:25,524 --> 02:24:27,650
“Have you told Miss Wood?”

2522
02:24:27,650 --> 02:24:28,788
inquired the bishop.

2523
02:24:28,788 --> 02:24:33,265
The eyes of the bridegroom fell,
and the bishop’s face grew at once more

2524
02:24:33,265 --> 02:24:34,953
keen and more troubled.

2525
02:24:34,953 --> 02:24:39,276
Then the bridegroom raised his eyes
again, and the bishop almost loved him.

2526
02:24:39,276 --> 02:24:41,471
He touched his arm, like a brother.

2527
02:24:41,471 --> 02:24:43,320
“This is hard luck,” he said.

2528
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:46,584
The bridegroom could scarce
keep his voice steady.

2529
02:24:46,584 --> 02:24:52,722
“I want to do right today more than any
day I have ever lived,” said he.

2530
02:24:52,722 --> 02:24:54,674
“Then go and tell her at once.”

2531
02:24:54,674 --> 02:24:57,414
“It will just do nothing but scare her.”

2532
02:24:57,414 --> -1:59:59,000
“Go and tell her at once.

2533
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2534
02:24:59,279 --> 02:25:03,090
“I expected you was going to tell me to
run away from Trampas.

2535
02:25:03,090 --> 02:25:04,515
I can’t do that, yu’ know.”

2536
02:25:04,515 --> 02:25:06,013
The bishop did know.

2537
02:25:06,013 --> 02:25:10,077
Never before in all his wilderness work
had he faced such a thing.

2538
02:25:10,077 --> 02:25:13,065
He knew that Trampas was an evil in the
country, and that the

2539
02:25:13,065 --> 02:25:15,666
Virginian was a good.

2540
02:25:15,666 --> 02:25:20,194
He knew that the cattle thieves⁠—the
rustlers⁠—were gaining,

2541
02:25:20,194 --> 02:25:24,725
in numbers and audacity;
that they led many weak young fellows to

2542
02:25:24,725 --> 02:25:29,968
ruin; that they elected their men to
office, and controlled juries;

2543
02:25:29,968 --> 02:25:32,604
that they were a staring
menace to Wyoming.

2544
02:25:32,604 --> 02:25:35,359
His heart was with the Virginian.

2545
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:40,302
But there was his Gospel,
that he preached, and believed,

2546
02:25:40,302 --> 02:25:41,691
and tried to live.

2547
02:25:41,691 --> 02:25:45,831
He stood looking at the ground and
drawing a finger along his eyebrow.

2548
02:25:45,831 --> 02:25:49,356
He wished that he might have heard
nothing about all this.

2549
02:25:49,356 --> 02:25:52,673
But he was not one to blink his
responsibility as a Christian server

2550
02:25:52,673 --> 02:25:54,283
of the church militant.

2551
02:25:54,283 --> 02:25:59,076
“Am I right,” he now slowly asked,
“in believing that you think I

2552
02:25:59,076 --> 02:26:00,396
am a sincere man?”

2553
02:26:00,396 --> 02:26:02,276
“I don’t believe anything about it.

2554
02:26:02,276 --> 02:26:03,276
I know it.”

2555
02:26:03,276 --> 02:26:06,743
“I should run away from
Trampas,” said the bishop.

2556
02:26:06,743 --> 02:26:08,676
“That ain’t quite fair, seh.

2557
02:26:08,676 --> 02:26:13,287
We all understand you have got to do the
things you tell other folks to do.

2558
02:26:13,287 --> 02:26:15,673
And you do them, seh.

2559
02:26:15,673 --> 02:26:20,208
You never talk like anything but a man,
and you never set yourself above others.

2560
02:26:20,208 --> 02:26:22,765
You can saddle your own horses.

2561
02:26:22,765 --> 02:26:26,790
And I saw yu’ walk unarmed into that
White River excitement when those two

2562
02:26:26,790 --> 02:26:31,811
other parsons was a-foggin’ and a-
fannin’ for their own safety.

2563
02:26:31,811 --> 02:26:33,353
Damn scoundrels!”

2564
02:26:33,353 --> 02:26:37,713
The bishop instantly rebuked such
language about brothers of his cloth,

2565
02:26:37,713 --> 02:26:40,971
even though he disapproved both of
them and their doctrines.

2566
02:26:40,971 --> 02:26:44,484
“Everyone may be an instrument
of Providence,” he concluded.

2567
02:26:44,484 --> 02:26:49,594
“Well,” said the Virginian,
“if that is so, then Providence makes

2568
02:26:49,594 --> 02:26:53,549
use of instruments I’d not touch with
a ten-foot pole.

2569
02:26:53,549 --> 02:26:57,379
Now if you was me, seh,
and not a bishop, would you

2570
02:26:57,379 --> -1:59:59,000
run away from Trampas?

2571
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2572
02:26:59,492 --> 02:27:01,982
“That’s not quite fair, either!”

2573
02:27:01,982 --> 02:27:03,710
exclaimed the bishop, with a smile.

2574
02:27:03,710 --> 02:27:06,403
“Because you are asking me to take
another man’s convictions,

2575
02:27:06,403 --> 02:27:07,803
and yet remain myself.”

2576
02:27:07,803 --> 02:27:08,843
“Yes, seh.

2577
02:27:08,843 --> 02:27:10,145
I am.

2578
02:27:10,145 --> 02:27:12,123
That’s so.

2579
02:27:12,123 --> 02:27:13,934
That don’t get at it.

2580
02:27:13,934 --> 02:27:16,436
I reckon you and I can’t get at it.”

2581
02:27:16,436 --> 02:27:20,514
“If the Bible,” said the bishop,
“which I believe to be God’s word,

2582
02:27:20,514 --> 02:27:21,954
was anything to you⁠—”

2583
02:27:21,954 --> 02:27:23,554
“It is something to me, seh.

2584
02:27:23,554 --> 02:27:26,136
I have found fine truths in it.”

2585
02:27:26,136 --> 02:27:28,830
“ ‘Thou shalt not kill,’
” quoted the bishop.

2586
02:27:28,830 --> 02:27:29,813
“That is plain.”

2587
02:27:29,813 --> 02:27:32,240
The Virginian took his turn at smiling.

2588
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:34,235
“Mighty plain to me, seh.

2589
02:27:34,235 --> 02:27:37,499
Make it plain to Trampas,
and there’ll be no killin’.

2590
02:27:37,499 --> 02:27:39,318
We can’t get at it that way.”

2591
02:27:39,318 --> 02:27:41,716
Once more the bishop quoted earnestly.

2592
02:27:41,716 --> -1:59:59,000
“ ‘Vengeance is mine,
I will repay, saith the Lord.’

2593
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2594
02:27:45,614 --> 02:27:48,319
“How about instruments of Providence, seh?

2595
02:27:48,319 --> 02:27:50,263
Why, we can’t get at it that way.

2596
02:27:50,263 --> 02:27:54,998
If you start usin’ the Bible that way,
it will mix you up mighty quick, seh.”

2597
02:27:54,998 --> 02:28:00,605
“My friend,” the bishop urged,
and all his good, warm heart was in it,

2598
02:28:00,605 --> 02:28:04,086
“my dear fellow⁠—go away
for the one night.

2599
02:28:04,086 --> 02:28:05,528
He’ll change his mind.”

2600
02:28:05,528 --> 02:28:07,288
The Virginian shook his head.

2601
02:28:07,288 --> 02:28:10,016
“He cannot change his word, seh.

2602
02:28:10,016 --> 02:28:12,576
Or at least I must stay
around till he does.

2603
02:28:12,576 --> 02:28:15,418
Why, I have given him the say-so.

2604
02:28:15,418 --> 02:28:16,893
He’s got the choice.

2605
02:28:16,893 --> 02:28:22,024
Most men would not have took what I took
from him in the saloon.

2606
02:28:22,024 --> 02:28:24,358
Why don’t you ask him to leave town?”

2607
02:28:24,358 --> 02:28:26,484
The good bishop was at a standstill.

2608
02:28:26,484 --> 02:28:32,994
Of all kicking against the pricks none is
so hard as this kick of a professing

2609
02:28:32,994 --> 02:28:36,007
Christian against the whole
instinct of human man.

2610
02:28:36,007 --> 02:28:39,361
“But you have helped me
some,” said the Virginian.

2611
02:28:39,361 --> 02:28:41,894
“I will go and tell her.

2612
02:28:41,894 --> 02:28:45,971
At least, if I think it will be good for
her, I will tell her.”

2613
02:28:45,971 --> 02:28:49,195
The bishop thought that he saw one last
chance to move him.

2614
02:28:49,195 --> 02:28:53,122
“You’re twenty-nine,” he began.

2615
02:28:53,122 --> 02:28:55,735
“And a little over,” said the Virginian.

2616
02:28:55,735 --> 02:28:58,893
“And you were fourteen when you ran
away from your family.”

2617
02:28:58,893 --> 02:29:05,652
“Well, I was weary, yu’ know,
of havin’ elder brothers lay down my

2618
02:29:05,652 --> 02:29:08,206
law night and mawnin’.”

2619
02:29:08,206 --> 02:29:10,120
“Yes, I know.

2620
02:29:10,120 --> 02:29:14,049
So that your life has been your
own for fifteen years.

2621
02:29:14,049 --> 02:29:16,063
But it is not your own now.

2622
02:29:16,063 --> 02:29:17,688
You have given it to a woman.”

2623
02:29:17,688 --> 02:29:20,151
“Yes; I have given it to her.

2624
02:29:20,151 --> 02:29:23,394
But my life’s not the whole of me.

2625
02:29:23,394 --> 02:29:26,243
I’d give her twice my life⁠—fifty⁠—
a thousand of ’em.

2626
02:29:26,243 --> 02:29:32,888
But I can’t give her⁠—her nor anybody in
heaven or earth⁠—I can’t give my⁠—my⁠—

2627
02:29:32,888 --> 02:29:34,715
we’ll never get at it, seh!

2628
02:29:34,715 --> 02:29:37,071
There’s no good in words.

2629
02:29:37,071 --> 02:29:37,727
Goodbye.”

2630
02:29:37,727 --> 02:29:41,713
The Virginian wrung the bishop’s
hand and left him.

2631
02:29:41,713 --> 02:29:43,107
“God bless him!”

2632
02:29:43,107 --> 02:29:44,196
said the bishop.

2633
02:29:44,196 --> 02:29:45,640
“God bless him!”

2634
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:50,918
The Virginian unlocked the room in the
hotel where he kept stored his tent,

2635
02:29:50,918 --> 02:29:54,427
his blankets, his packsaddles,
and his many accoutrements for the

2636
02:29:54,427 --> 02:29:56,186
bridal journey in the mountains.

2637
02:29:56,186 --> 02:30:01,549
Out of the window he saw the mountains
blue in shadow, but some cottonwoods

2638
02:30:01,549 --> 02:30:05,936
distant in the flat between were still
bright green in the sun.

2639
02:30:05,936 --> 02:30:10,108
From among his possessions he took
quickly a pistol, wiping and loading it.

2640
02:30:10,108 --> 02:30:15,488
Then from its holster he removed the
pistol which he had tried and made sure

2641
02:30:15,488 --> 02:30:16,951
of in the morning.

2642
02:30:16,951 --> 02:30:22,695
This, according to his wont when going
into a risk, he shoved between his

2643
02:30:22,695 --> 02:30:24,968
trousers and his shirt in front.

2644
02:30:24,968 --> 02:30:28,334
The untried weapon he placed in the
holster, letting it hang

2645
02:30:28,334 --> 02:30:29,834
visibly at his hip.

2646
02:30:29,834 --> 02:30:33,025
He glanced out of the window again,
and saw the mountains of

2647
02:30:33,025 --> 02:30:34,630
the same deep blue.

2648
02:30:34,630 --> 02:30:39,017
But the cottonwoods were no
longer in the sunlight.

2649
02:30:39,017 --> 02:30:43,220
The shadow had come past them,
nearer the town; for fifteen of the

2650
02:30:43,220 --> 02:30:44,726
forty minutes were gone.

2651
02:30:44,726 --> 02:30:46,437
“The bishop is wrong,” he said.

2652
02:30:46,437 --> 02:30:48,373
“There is no sense in telling her.”

2653
02:30:48,373 --> 02:30:52,019
And he turned to the door,
just as she came to it herself.

2654
02:30:52,019 --> 02:30:52,541
“Oh!”

2655
02:30:52,541 --> 02:30:54,883
she cried out at once, and rushed to him.

2656
02:30:54,883 --> 02:30:57,095
He swore as he held her close.

2657
02:30:57,095 --> 02:30:58,856
“The fools!”

2658
02:30:58,856 --> 02:30:59,550
he said.

2659
02:30:59,550 --> 02:31:00,651
“The fools!”

2660
02:31:00,651 --> 02:31:04,291
“It has been so frightful waiting for
you,” said she, leaning

2661
02:31:04,291 --> 02:31:05,378
her head against him.

2662
02:31:05,378 --> 02:31:07,349
“Who had to tell you this?”

2663
02:31:07,349 --> 02:31:08,256
he demanded.

2664
02:31:08,256 --> 02:31:09,517
“I don’t know.

2665
02:31:09,517 --> 02:31:11,285
Somebody just came and said it.”

2666
02:31:11,285 --> 02:31:13,930
“This is mean luck,” he
murmured, patting her.

2667
02:31:13,930 --> 02:31:15,205
“This is mean luck.”

2668
02:31:15,205 --> 02:31:20,486
She went on: “I wanted to run out and
find you; but I didn’t!

2669
02:31:20,486 --> 02:31:23,830
I didn’t!

2670
02:31:23,830 --> 02:31:29,082
I stayed quiet in my room till they said
you had come back.”

2671
02:31:29,082 --> 02:31:31,144
“It is mean luck.

2672
02:31:31,144 --> 02:31:33,195
Mighty mean,” he repeated.

2673
02:31:33,195 --> 02:31:34,731
“How could you be so long?”

2674
02:31:34,731 --> 02:31:35,921
she asked.

2675
02:31:35,921 --> 02:31:38,156
“Never mind, I’ve got you now.

2676
02:31:38,156 --> 02:31:39,516
It is over.”

2677
02:31:39,516 --> 02:31:42,458
Anger and sorrow filled him.

2678
02:31:42,458 --> 02:31:45,834
“I might have known some fool would
tell you,” he said.

2679
02:31:45,834 --> 02:31:47,298
“It’s all over.

2680
02:31:47,298 --> 02:31:51,591
Never mind.”

2681
02:31:51,591 --> 02:31:55,238
Her arms tightened their hold of him.

2682
02:31:55,238 --> 02:31:57,210
Then she let him go.

2683
02:31:57,210 --> 02:31:58,372
“What shall we do?”

2684
02:31:58,372 --> 02:31:59,232
she said.

2685
02:31:59,232 --> 02:32:00,728
“What now?”

2686
02:32:00,728 --> 02:32:01,580
“Now?”

2687
02:32:01,580 --> 02:32:02,546
he answered.

2688
02:32:02,546 --> 02:32:03,797
“Nothing now.”

2689
02:32:03,797 --> 02:32:06,726
She looked at him without understanding.

2690
02:32:06,726 --> 02:32:11,056
“I know it is a heap worse for you,”
he pursued, speaking slowly.

2691
02:32:11,056 --> 02:32:12,406
“I knew it would be.”

2692
02:32:12,406 --> 02:32:13,791
“But it is over!”

2693
02:32:13,791 --> 02:32:15,040
she exclaimed again.

2694
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:17,216
He did not understand her now.

2695
02:32:17,216 --> 02:32:19,246
He kissed her.

2696
02:32:19,246 --> 02:32:22,007
“Did you think it was over?”

2697
02:32:22,007 --> 02:32:24,590
he said simply.

2698
02:32:24,590 --> 02:32:27,036
“There is some waiting still before us.

2699
02:32:27,036 --> 02:32:29,308
I wish you did not have to wait alone.

2700
02:32:29,308 --> 02:32:30,603
But it will not be long.”

2701
02:32:30,603 --> 02:32:36,316
He was looking down, and did not see the
happiness grow chilled upon her face,

2702
02:32:36,316 --> 02:32:38,563
and then fade into bewildered fear.

2703
02:32:38,563 --> 02:32:41,357
“I did my best,” he went on.

2704
02:32:41,357 --> 02:32:42,856
“I think I did.

2705
02:32:42,856 --> 02:32:44,261
I know I tried.

2706
02:32:44,261 --> 02:32:49,197
I let him say to me before them all what
no man has ever said, or ever will

2707
02:32:49,197 --> 02:32:49,800
again.

2708
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:53,552
I kept thinking hard of you⁠—with all my
might, or I reckon I’d have

2709
02:32:53,552 --> 02:32:54,497
killed him right there.

2710
02:32:54,497 --> 02:32:58,026
And I gave him a show to change his mind.

2711
02:32:58,026 --> 02:33:00,817
I gave it to him twice.

2712
02:33:00,817 --> 02:33:03,907
I spoke as quiet as I am
speaking to you now.

2713
02:33:03,907 --> 02:33:04,922
But he stood to it.

2714
02:33:04,922 --> 02:33:09,809
And I expect he knows he went too far in
the hearing of others to go

2715
02:33:09,809 --> 02:33:10,950
back on his threat.

2716
02:33:10,950 --> -1:59:59,000
He will have to go on to the finish now.

2717
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2718
02:33:13,649 --> 02:33:15,231
“The finish?”

2719
02:33:15,231 --> 02:33:17,763
she echoed, almost voiceless.

2720
02:33:17,763 --> 02:33:20,840
“Yes,” he answered very gently.

2721
02:33:20,840 --> 02:33:24,697
Her dilated eyes were fixed upon him.

2722
02:33:24,697 --> 02:33:28,989
“But⁠—” she could scarce
form utterance, “but you?”

2723
02:33:28,989 --> 02:33:32,515
“I have got myself ready,” he said.

2724
02:33:32,515 --> 02:33:36,771
“Did you think⁠—why, what did you think?”

2725
02:33:36,771 --> 02:33:38,074
She recoiled a step.

2726
02:33:38,074 --> 02:33:41,285
“What are you going⁠—” She put her two
hands to her head.

2727
02:33:41,285 --> 02:33:42,826
“Oh, God!”

2728
02:33:42,826 --> 02:33:45,330
she almost shrieked, “you are going⁠—”

2729
02:33:45,330 --> 02:33:49,628
He made a step, and would have put his
arm round her, but she backed against

2730
02:33:49,628 --> 02:33:52,887
the wall, staring speechless at him.

2731
02:33:52,887 --> 02:33:57,222
“I am not going to let him shoot
me,” he said quietly.

2732
02:33:57,222 --> 02:34:00,374
“You mean⁠—you mean⁠—but
you can come away!”

2733
02:34:00,374 --> 02:34:01,147
she cried.

2734
02:34:01,147 --> 02:34:02,647
“It’s not too late yet.

2735
02:34:02,647 --> 02:34:05,278
You can take yourself out of his reach.

2736
02:34:05,278 --> 02:34:07,818
Everybody knows that you are brave.

2737
02:34:07,818 --> 02:34:09,524
What is he to you?

2738
02:34:09,524 --> 02:34:11,592
You can leave him in this place.

2739
02:34:11,592 --> 02:34:13,240
I’ll go with you anywhere.

2740
02:34:13,240 --> 02:34:18,236
To any house, to the mountains,
to anywhere away.

2741
02:34:18,236 --> 02:34:22,708
We’ll leave this horrible place together
and⁠—and⁠—oh, won’t you listen to me?”

2742
02:34:22,708 --> 02:34:24,260
She stretched her hands to him.

2743
02:34:24,260 --> 02:34:25,159
“Won’t you listen?”

2744
02:34:25,159 --> 02:34:26,432
He took her hands.

2745
02:34:26,432 --> 02:34:28,005
“I must stay here.”

2746
02:34:28,005 --> 02:34:29,768
Her hands clung to his.

2747
02:34:29,768 --> 02:34:32,735
“No, no, no.

2748
02:34:32,735 --> 02:34:33,925
There’s something else.

2749
02:34:33,925 --> 02:34:37,104
There’s something better than shedding
blood in cold blood.

2750
02:34:37,104 --> 02:34:39,791
Only think what it means!

2751
02:34:39,791 --> 02:34:42,396
Only think of having to
remember such a thing!

2752
02:34:42,396 --> 02:34:45,148
Why, it’s what they hang people for!

2753
02:34:45,148 --> 02:34:46,120
It’s murder!”

2754
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:47,533
He dropped her hands.

2755
02:34:47,533 --> 02:34:50,153
“Don’t call it that name,”
he said sternly.

2756
02:34:50,153 --> 02:34:51,629
“When there was the choice!”

2757
02:34:51,629 --> 02:34:55,923
she exclaimed, half to herself,
like a person stunned and

2758
02:34:55,923 --> 02:34:57,120
speaking to the air.

2759
02:34:57,120 --> 02:34:59,778
“To get ready for it when
you have the choice!”

2760
02:34:59,778 --> 02:35:02,595
“He did the choosing,”
answered the Virginian.

2761
02:35:02,595 --> 02:35:03,717
“Listen to me.

2762
02:35:03,717 --> 02:35:05,452
Are you listening?”

2763
02:35:05,452 --> 02:35:08,030
he asked, for her gaze was dull.

2764
02:35:08,030 --> 02:35:09,362
She nodded.

2765
02:35:09,362 --> 02:35:12,262
“I work hyeh.

2766
02:35:12,262 --> 02:35:13,992
I belong hyeh.

2767
02:35:13,992 --> 02:35:15,308
It’s my life.

2768
02:35:15,308 --> 02:35:18,351
If folks came to think I was a coward⁠—”

2769
02:35:18,351 --> 02:35:20,468
“Who would think you were a coward?”

2770
02:35:20,468 --> 02:35:21,096
“Everybody.

2771
02:35:21,096 --> 02:35:25,788
My friends would be sorry and ashamed,
and my enemies would walk around saying

2772
02:35:25,788 --> 02:35:27,374
they had always said so.

2773
02:35:27,374 --> 02:35:30,739
I could not hold up my head again
among enemies or friends.”

2774
02:35:30,739 --> 02:35:31,989
“When it was explained⁠—”

2775
02:35:31,989 --> 02:35:33,950
“There’d be nothing to explain.

2776
02:35:33,950 --> 02:35:35,893
There’d just be the fact.”

2777
02:35:35,893 --> 02:35:37,023
He was nearly angry.

2778
02:35:37,023 --> 02:35:41,678
“There is a higher courage than fear of
outside opinion,” said

2779
02:35:41,678 --> 02:35:43,274
the New England girl.

2780
02:35:43,274 --> 02:35:46,316
Her Southern lover looked at her.

2781
02:35:46,316 --> 02:35:47,527
“Cert’nly there is.

2782
02:35:47,527 --> -1:59:59,000
That’s what I’m showing
in going against yours.

2783
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2784
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:53,753
“But if you know that you are brave,
and if I know that you are brave,

2785
02:35:53,753 --> 02:35:56,066
oh, my dear, my dear!

2786
02:35:56,066 --> 02:35:58,319
what difference does the world make?

2787
02:35:58,319 --> 02:36:01,300
How much higher courage to
go your own course⁠—”

2788
02:36:01,300 --> 02:36:04,683
“I am goin’ my own course,” he broke in.

2789
02:36:04,683 --> 02:36:07,866
“Can’t yu’ see how it must be about a man?

2790
02:36:07,866 --> 02:36:12,981
It’s not for their benefit,
friends or enemies, that I have got

2791
02:36:12,981 --> 02:36:14,248
this thing to do.

2792
02:36:14,248 --> 02:36:17,723
If any man happened to say I was a thief
and I heard about it,

2793
02:36:17,723 --> 02:36:20,580
would I let him go on spreadin’ such
a thing of me?

2794
02:36:20,580 --> 02:36:23,723
Don’t I owe my own honesty
something better than that?

2795
02:36:23,723 --> 02:36:29,333
Would I sit down in a corner rubbin’ my
honesty and whisperin’ to it, ‘There!

2796
02:36:29,333 --> 02:36:30,244
there!

2797
02:36:30,244 --> 02:36:31,458
I know you ain’t a thief?’

2798
02:36:31,458 --> 02:36:33,484
No, seh; not a little bit!

2799
02:36:33,484 --> 02:36:37,810
What men say about my nature is not just
merely an outside thing.

2800
02:36:37,810 --> 02:36:42,617
For the fact that I let ’em keep on
sayin’ it is a proof I don’t value my

2801
02:36:42,617 --> 02:36:48,154
nature enough to shield it from their
slander and give them their punishment.

2802
02:36:48,154 --> -1:59:59,000
And that’s being a poor sort of a jay.

2803
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2804
02:36:50,396 --> 02:36:52,026
She had grown very white.

2805
02:36:52,026 --> 02:36:54,308
“Can’t yu’ see how it must
be about a man?”

2806
02:36:54,308 --> 02:36:55,501
he repeated.

2807
02:36:55,501 --> 02:37:00,826
“I cannot,” she answered,
in a voice that scarcely seemed her own.

2808
02:37:00,826 --> 02:37:02,491
“If I ought to, I cannot.

2809
02:37:02,491 --> 02:37:06,672
To shed blood in cold blood.

2810
02:37:06,672 --> 02:37:12,092
When I heard about that last fall⁠—about
the killing of those cattle thieves⁠—I

2811
02:37:12,092 --> 02:37:15,807
kept saying to myself: ‘He had to do it.

2812
02:37:15,807 --> 02:37:18,574
It was a public duty.’

2813
02:37:18,574 --> 02:37:23,628
And lying sleepless I got used to Wyoming
being different from Vermont.

2814
02:37:23,628 --> 02:37:28,734
But this⁠—” she gave a shudder⁠—“when I
think of tomorrow, of you and me,

2815
02:37:28,734 --> -1:59:59,000
and of⁠—If you do this,
there can be no tomorrow for you and me.

2816
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2817
02:37:32,895 --> 02:37:36,209
At these words he also turned white.

2818
02:37:36,209 --> 02:37:39,556
“Do you mean⁠—” he asked,
and could go no farther.

2819
02:37:39,556 --> 02:37:43,276
Nor could she answer him,
but turned her head away.

2820
02:37:43,276 --> 02:37:44,990
“This would be the end?”

2821
02:37:44,990 --> 02:37:46,097
he asked.

2822
02:37:46,097 --> 02:37:49,097
Her head faintly moved to signify yes.

2823
02:37:49,097 --> 02:37:52,353
He stood still, his hand shaking a little.

2824
02:37:52,353 --> 02:37:54,206
“Will you look at me and say that?”

2825
02:37:54,206 --> 02:37:55,275
he murmured at length.

2826
02:37:55,275 --> 02:37:56,644
She did not move.

2827
02:37:56,644 --> 02:37:57,627
“Can you do it?”

2828
02:37:57,627 --> 02:37:58,374
he said.

2829
02:37:58,374 --> 02:38:02,470
His sweetness made her turn,
but could not pierce her frozen resolve.

2830
02:38:02,470 --> 02:38:06,540
She gazed at him across the great
distance of her despair.

2831
02:38:06,540 --> 02:38:08,430
“Then it is really so?”

2832
02:38:08,430 --> 02:38:09,145
he said.

2833
02:38:09,145 --> 02:38:12,007
Her lips tried to form words, but failed.

2834
02:38:12,007 --> 02:38:15,370
He looked out of the window,
and saw nothing but shadow.

2835
02:38:15,370 --> 02:38:19,319
The blue of the mountains was now
become a deep purple.

2836
02:38:19,319 --> 02:38:21,964
Suddenly his hand closed hard.

2837
02:38:21,964 --> 02:38:23,925
“Goodbye, then,” he said.

2838
02:38:23,925 --> 02:38:26,960
At that word she was at
his feet, clutching him.

2839
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:28,952
“For my sake,” she begged him.

2840
02:38:28,952 --> 02:38:30,175
“For my sake.”

2841
02:38:30,175 --> 02:38:32,909
A tremble passed through his frame.

2842
02:38:32,909 --> 02:38:37,137
She felt his legs shake as she held them,
and, looking up, she saw that his eyes

2843
02:38:37,137 --> 02:38:39,090
were closed with misery.

2844
02:38:39,090 --> 02:38:42,303
Then he opened them, and in their steady
look she read her answer.

2845
02:38:42,303 --> 02:38:46,744
He unclasped her hands from holding him,
and raised her to her feet.

2846
02:38:46,744 --> 02:38:52,485
“I have no right to kiss you
any more,” he said.

2847
02:38:52,485 --> 02:38:58,865
And then, before his desire could break
him down from this, he was gone,

2848
02:38:58,865 --> 02:38:59,776
and she was alone.

2849
02:38:59,776 --> 02:39:03,278
She did not fall, or totter,
but stood motionless.

2850
02:39:03,278 --> 02:39:07,478
And next⁠—it seemed a moment and it
seemed eternity⁠—she heard in the

2851
02:39:07,478 --> 02:39:10,751
distance a shot, and then two shots.

2852
02:39:10,751 --> 02:39:14,124
Out of the window she saw
people beginning to run.

2853
02:39:14,124 --> 02:39:18,111
At that she turned and fled to her room,
and flung herself face

2854
02:39:18,111 --> 02:39:19,859
downward upon the floor.

2855
02:39:19,859 --> 02:39:24,271
Trampas had departed into solitude from
the saloon, leaving behind

2856
02:39:24,271 --> 02:39:26,067
him his ultimatum.

2857
02:39:26,067 --> 02:39:32,111
His loud and public threat was town
knowledge already, would very likely

2858
02:39:32,111 --> 02:39:34,334
be county knowledge tonight.

2859
02:39:34,334 --> 02:39:39,605
Riders would take it with them to
entertain distant cabins up the river

2860
02:39:39,605 --> 02:39:44,345
and down the river; and by dark the
stage would go south with the news of

2861
02:39:44,345 --> 02:39:47,289
it⁠—and the news of its outcome.

2862
02:39:47,289 --> 02:39:50,460
For everything would be over by dark.

2863
02:39:50,460 --> -1:59:59,000
After five years, here was the end
coming⁠—coming before dark

2864
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

2865
02:39:56,208 --> 02:39:59,713
Trampas had got up this morning
with no such thought.

2866
02:39:59,713 --> 02:40:03,283
It seemed very strange to look back upon
the morning; it lay so

2867
02:40:03,283 --> 02:40:05,534
distant, so irrevocable.

2868
02:40:05,534 --> 02:40:08,637
And he thought of how he
had eaten his breakfast.

2869
02:40:08,637 --> 02:40:10,375
How would he eat his supper?

2870
02:40:10,375 --> 02:40:13,662
For supper would come afterward.

2871
02:40:13,662 --> 02:40:17,080
Some people were eating theirs now,
with nothing like this before them.

2872
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:21,961
His heart ached and grew cold to think of
them, easy and comfortable with plates

2873
02:40:21,961 --> 02:40:23,390
and cups of coffee.

2874
02:40:23,390 --> 02:40:26,984
He looked at the mountains,
and saw the sun above their ridges,

2875
02:40:26,984 --> 02:40:29,183
and the shadow coming from their feet.

2876
02:40:29,183 --> 02:40:33,371
And there close behind him was the
morning he could never go back to.

2877
02:40:33,371 --> 02:40:36,703
He could see it clearly;
his thoughts reached out like arms to

2878
02:40:36,703 --> 02:40:40,200
touch it once more, and be in it again.

2879
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:44,207
The night that was coming he could not
see, and his eyes and his

2880
02:40:44,207 --> 02:40:45,806
thoughts shrank from it.

2881
02:40:45,806 --> 02:40:48,686
He had given his enemy until sundown.

2882
02:40:48,686 --> 02:40:52,762
He could not trace the path which had
led him to this.

2883
02:40:52,762 --> 02:40:57,144
He remembered their first meeting⁠—five
years back, in Medicine Bow,

2884
02:40:57,144 --> 02:41:00,218
and the words which at
once began his hate.

2885
02:41:00,218 --> 02:41:05,523
No, it was before any words;
it was the encounter of their eyes.

2886
02:41:05,523 --> 02:41:11,160
For out of the eyes of every stranger
looks either a friend or an enemy,

2887
02:41:11,160 --> 02:41:12,342
waiting to be known.

2888
02:41:12,342 --> 02:41:17,434
But how had five years of hate come to
play him such a trick, suddenly, today?

2889
02:41:17,434 --> 02:41:21,160
Since last autumn he had meant sometime
to get even with this man who seemed to

2890
02:41:21,160 --> 02:41:25,737
stand at every turn of his crookedness,
and rob him of his spoils.

2891
02:41:25,737 --> 02:41:32,338
But how had he come to choose such a way
of getting even as this, face to face?

2892
02:41:32,338 --> 02:41:34,909
He knew many better ways;
and now his own rash

2893
02:41:34,909 --> 02:41:36,332
proclamation had trapped him.

2894
02:41:36,332 --> 02:41:41,861
His words were like doors shutting him in
to perform his threat to the letter,

2895
02:41:41,861 --> 02:41:45,252
with witnesses at hand to see
that he did so.

2896
02:41:45,252 --> 02:41:48,652
Trampas looked at the sun
and the shadow again.

2897
02:41:48,652 --> 02:41:50,889
He had till sundown.

2898
02:41:50,889 --> 02:41:54,821
The heart inside him was turning it round
in this opposite way:

2899
02:41:54,821 --> 02:42:00,836
it was to himself that in his rage he
had given this lessening margin of

2900
02:42:00,836 --> 02:42:02,026
grace.

2901
02:42:02,026 --> 02:42:05,426
But he dared not leave town in all the
world’s sight after all the

2902
02:42:05,426 --> 02:42:06,619
world had heard him.

2903
02:42:06,619 --> 02:42:11,441
Even his friends would fall from him
after such an act.

2904
02:42:11,441 --> 02:42:16,008
Could he⁠—the thought actually came to
him⁠—could he strike before the time

2905
02:42:16,008 --> 02:42:16,848
set?

2906
02:42:16,848 --> 02:42:18,950
But the thought was useless.

2907
02:42:18,950 --> 02:42:23,794
Even if his friends could harbor him
after such a deed, his enemies would

2908
02:42:23,794 --> 02:42:29,100
find him, and his life would be
forfeit to a certainty.

2909
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:32,543
His own trap was closing upon him.

2910
02:42:32,543 --> 02:42:36,595
He came upon the main street,
and saw some distance off the Virginian

2911
02:42:36,595 --> 02:42:38,580
standing in talk with the bishop.

2912
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:42,466
He slunk between two houses,
and cursed both of them.

2913
02:42:42,466 --> 02:42:46,799
The sight had been good for him,
bringing some warmth of rage back

2914
02:42:46,799 --> 02:42:48,004
to his desperate heart.

2915
02:42:48,004 --> 02:42:51,239
And he went into a place
and drank some whiskey.

2916
02:42:51,239 --> 02:42:56,654
“In your shoes,” said the barkeeper,
“I’d be afraid to take so much.”

2917
02:42:56,654 --> 02:43:02,728
But the nerves of Trampas were almost
beyond the reach of intoxication,

2918
02:43:02,728 --> 02:43:06,350
and he swallowed some more,
and went out again.

2919
02:43:06,350 --> 02:43:09,982
Presently he fell in with some of his
brothers in cattle stealing,

2920
02:43:09,982 --> 02:43:11,874
and walked along with them for a little.

2921
02:43:11,874 --> 02:43:14,972
“Well, it will not be long now,”
they said to him.

2922
02:43:14,972 --> 02:43:17,457
And he had never heard words so desolate.

2923
02:43:17,457 --> 02:43:20,373
“No,” he made out to say; “soon now.”

2924
02:43:20,373 --> 02:43:24,123
Their cheerfulness seemed unearthly to
him, and his heart almost

2925
02:43:24,123 --> 02:43:26,290
broke beneath it.

2926
02:43:26,290 --> 02:43:29,356
“We’ll have one to your
success,” they suggested.

2927
02:43:29,356 --> 02:43:33,447
So with them he repaired to another
place; and the sight of a man leaning

2928
02:43:33,447 --> 02:43:36,640
against the bar made him start so
that they noticed him.

2929
02:43:36,640 --> 02:43:41,951
Then he saw that the man was a stranger
whom he had never laid eyes on till now.

2930
02:43:41,951 --> 02:43:44,070
“It looked like Shorty,”
he said, and could have

2931
02:43:44,070 --> 02:43:45,231
bitten his tongue off.

2932
02:43:45,231 --> 02:43:48,622
“Shorty is quiet up in the
Tetons,” said a friend.

2933
02:43:48,622 --> 02:43:50,924
“You don’t want to be thinking about him.

2934
02:43:50,924 --> 02:43:51,840
Here’s how!”

2935
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:54,018
Then they clapped him on the back
and he left them.

2936
02:43:54,018 --> 02:43:59,382
He thought of his enemy and his hate,
beating his rage like a failing horse,

2937
02:43:59,382 --> 02:44:01,564
and treading the courage of his drink.

2938
02:44:01,564 --> 02:44:06,271
Across a space he saw Wiggin,
walking with McLean and Scipio.

2939
02:44:06,271 --> 02:44:11,825
They were watching the town to see that
his friends made no foul play.

2940
02:44:11,825 --> 02:44:14,822
“We’re giving you a clear
field,” said Wiggin.

2941
02:44:14,822 --> 02:44:18,226
“This race will not be
pulled,” said McLean.

2942
02:44:18,226 --> 02:44:20,855
“Be with you at the finish,” said Scipio.

2943
02:44:20,855 --> 02:44:23,089
And they passed on.

2944
02:44:23,089 --> 02:44:27,891
They did not seem like real people to him.

2945
02:44:27,891 --> 02:44:32,548
Trampas looked at the walls and
windows of the houses.

2946
02:44:32,548 --> 02:44:33,429
Were they real?

2947
02:44:33,429 --> 02:44:35,940
Was he here, walking in this street?

2948
02:44:35,940 --> 02:44:37,401
Something had changed.

2949
02:44:37,401 --> 02:44:40,672
He looked everywhere,
and feeling it everywhere,

2950
02:44:40,672 --> 02:44:42,367
wondered what this could be.

2951
02:44:42,367 --> 02:44:47,539
Then he knew: it was the sun that had
gone entirely behind the mountains,

2952
02:44:47,539 --> 02:44:49,092
and he drew out his pistol.

2953
02:44:49,092 --> 02:44:53,834
The Virginian, for precaution,
did not walk out of the front

2954
02:44:53,834 --> 02:44:54,832
door of the hotel.

2955
02:44:54,832 --> 02:44:57,547
He went through back ways,
and paused once.

2956
02:44:57,547 --> 02:45:02,803
Against his breast he felt the wedding
ring where he had it suspended by a

2957
02:45:02,803 --> 02:45:04,392
chain from his neck.

2958
02:45:04,392 --> 02:45:07,967
His hand went up to it,
and he drew it out and looked at it.

2959
02:45:07,967 --> 02:45:11,606
He took it off the chain,
and his arm went back to hurl it from

2960
02:45:11,606 --> 02:45:13,130
him as far as he could.

2961
02:45:13,130 --> 02:45:17,253
But he stopped and kissed it with one
sob, and thrust it in his pocket.

2962
02:45:17,253 --> 02:45:20,262
Then he walked out into
the open, watching.

2963
02:45:20,262 --> 02:45:23,705
He saw men here and there,
and they let him pass

2964
02:45:23,705 --> 02:45:26,401
as before, without speaking.

2965
02:45:26,401 --> 02:45:29,975
He saw his three friends,
and they said no word to him.

2966
02:45:29,975 --> 02:45:34,245
But they turned and followed in his rear
at a little distance,

2967
02:45:34,245 --> 02:45:38,538
because it was known that Shorty had
been found shot from behind.

2968
02:45:38,538 --> 02:45:43,123
The Virginian gained a position soon
where no one could come at him except

2969
02:45:43,123 --> 02:45:46,357
from in front; and the sight of the
mountains was almost more than he could

2970
02:45:46,357 --> 02:45:49,721
endure, because it was there that he
had been going tomorrow.

2971
02:45:49,721 --> 02:45:53,966
“It is quite a while after sunset,”
he heard himself say.

2972
02:45:53,966 --> 02:45:58,360
A wind seemed to blow his sleeve off his
arm, and he replied to it,

2973
02:45:58,360 --> 02:46:01,595
and saw Trampas pitch forward.

2974
02:46:01,595 --> 02:46:05,321
He saw Trampas raise his arm from the
ground and fall again,

2975
02:46:05,321 --> 02:46:07,545
and lie there this time, still.

2976
02:46:07,545 --> 02:46:12,336
A little smoke was rising from the pistol
on the ground, and he looked at his own,

2977
02:46:12,336 --> 02:46:15,822
and saw the smoke flowing
upward out of it.

2978
02:46:15,822 --> 02:46:18,452
“I expect that’s all,” he said aloud.

2979
02:46:18,452 --> 02:46:21,855
But as he came nearer Trampas,
he covered him with his weapon.

2980
02:46:21,855 --> 02:46:24,994
He stopped a moment, seeing the hand
on the ground move.

2981
02:46:24,994 --> 02:46:31,036
Two fingers twitched,
and then ceased; for it was all.

2982
02:46:31,036 --> 02:46:34,548
The Virginian stood looking
down at Trampas.

2983
02:46:34,548 --> 02:46:37,296
“Both of mine hit,” he
said, once more aloud.

2984
02:46:37,296 --> 02:46:42,010
“His must have gone mighty
close to my arm.

2985
02:46:42,010 --> 02:46:45,383
I told her it would not be me.”

2986
02:46:45,383 --> 02:46:49,667
He had scarcely noticed that he was
being surrounded and congratulated.

2987
02:46:49,667 --> 02:46:55,803
His hand was being shaken,
and he saw it was Scipio in tears.

2988
02:46:55,803 --> 02:47:00,553
Scipio’s joy made his heart
like lead within him.

2989
02:47:00,553 --> 02:47:04,403
He was near telling his friend
everything, but he did not.

2990
02:47:04,403 --> 02:47:08,539
“If anybody wants me about this,”
he said, “I will be at the hotel.”

2991
02:47:08,539 --> 02:47:09,779
“Who’ll want you?”

2992
02:47:09,779 --> 02:47:10,603
said Scipio.

2993
02:47:10,603 --> 02:47:12,483
“Three of us saw his gun out.”

2994
02:47:12,483 --> 02:47:14,166
And he vented his admiration.

2995
02:47:14,166 --> 02:47:16,030
“You were that cool!

2996
02:47:16,030 --> 02:47:16,883
That quick!”

2997
02:47:16,883 --> 02:47:19,874
“I’ll see you boys again,”
said the Virginian, heavily;

2998
02:47:19,874 --> 02:47:20,879
and he walked away.

2999
02:47:20,879 --> 02:47:23,841
Scipio looked after him, astonished.

3000
02:47:23,841 --> 02:47:28,166
“Yu’ might suppose he was in poor luck,”
he said to McLean.

3001
02:47:28,166 --> 02:47:31,568
The Virginian walked to the hotel,
and stood on the threshold

3002
02:47:31,568 --> 02:47:32,866
of his sweetheart’s room.

3003
02:47:32,866 --> 02:47:35,753
She had heard his step,
and was upon her feet.

3004
02:47:35,753 --> 02:47:39,168
Her lips were parted,
and her eyes fixed on him,

3005
02:47:39,168 --> 02:47:41,522
nor did she move, or speak.

3006
02:47:41,522 --> 02:47:43,826
“Yu’ have to know it,” said he.

3007
02:47:43,826 --> 02:47:45,554
“I have killed Trampas.”

3008
02:47:45,554 --> 02:47:47,226
“Oh, thank God!”

3009
02:47:47,226 --> 02:47:49,627
she said; and he found her in his arms.

3010
02:47:49,627 --> 02:47:53,365
Long they embraced without speaking,
and what they whispered then with

3011
02:47:53,365 --> 02:47:56,059
their kisses, matters not.

3012
02:47:56,059 --> 02:48:00,986
Thus did her New England conscience
battle to the end, and,

3013
02:48:00,986 --> 02:48:04,731
in the end, capitulate to love.

3014
02:48:04,731 --> 02:48:09,080
And the next day, with the bishop’s
blessing, and Mrs. Taylor’s broadest

3015
02:48:09,080 --> 02:48:13,751
smile, and the ring on her finger,
the Virginian departed with his

3016
02:48:13,751 --> 02:48:15,375
bride into the mountains.

3017
02:48:15,375 --> 02:48:16,932
CHAPTER XXXVI

3018
02:48:16,932 --> 02:48:18,036
At Dunbarton

3019
02:48:18,036 --> 02:48:21,233
For their first bridal camp
he chose an island.

3020
02:48:21,233 --> 02:48:26,530
Long weeks beforehand he had thought of
this place, and set his heart upon it.

3021
02:48:26,530 --> 02:48:30,778
Once established in his mind,
the thought became a picture that he

3022
02:48:30,778 --> 02:48:32,787
saw waking and sleeping.

3023
02:48:32,787 --> 02:48:36,563
He had stopped at the island many times
alone, and in all seasons;

3024
02:48:36,563 --> 02:48:40,522
but at this special moment of the year
he liked it best.

3025
02:48:40,522 --> 02:48:45,945
Often he had added several needless miles
to his journey that he might finish the

3026
02:48:45,945 --> 02:48:51,569
day at this point, might catch the trout
for his supper beside a certain rock

3027
02:48:51,569 --> 02:48:57,477
upon its edge, and fall asleep hearing
the stream on either side of him.

3028
02:48:57,477 --> 02:49:02,616
Always for him the first signs that he
had gained the true world of the

3029
02:49:02,616 --> 02:49:05,041
mountains began at the island.

3030
02:49:05,041 --> 02:49:09,058
The first pine trees stood upon it;
the first white columbine grew in their

3031
02:49:09,058 --> 02:49:13,420
shade; and it seemed to him that he
always met here the first of the true

3032
02:49:13,420 --> 02:49:17,154
mountain air⁠—the coolness
and the new fragrance.

3033
02:49:17,154 --> 02:49:23,163
Below, there were only the cottonwoods,
and the knolls and steep foothills with

3034
02:49:23,163 --> 02:49:29,625
their sagebrush, and the great warm air
of the plains; here at this altitude

3035
02:49:29,625 --> 02:49:32,017
came the definite change.

3036
02:49:32,017 --> 02:49:35,419
Out of the lower country and its air he
would urge his horse upward,

3037
02:49:35,419 --> 02:49:38,177
talking to him aloud,
and promising fine pasture

3038
02:49:38,177 --> 02:49:39,265
in a little while.

3039
02:49:39,265 --> 02:49:42,807
Then, when at length he had ridden
abreast of the island pines,

3040
02:49:42,807 --> 02:49:46,668
he would ford to the sheltered circle of
his campground, throw off the saddle and

3041
02:49:46,668 --> 02:49:51,553
blanket from the horse’s hot,
wet back, throw his own clothes off,

3042
02:49:51,553 --> 02:49:56,737
and, shouting, spring upon the horse
bare, and with a rope for bridle,

3043
02:49:56,737 --> 02:49:59,455
cross with him to the promised pasture.

3044
02:49:59,455 --> 02:50:03,826
Here there was a pause in the mountain
steepness, a level space of open,

3045
02:50:03,826 --> 02:50:05,661
green with thick grass.

3046
02:50:05,661 --> 02:50:08,739
Riding his horse to this,
he would leap off him,

3047
02:50:08,739 --> 02:50:15,280
and with the flat of his hand give him a
blow that cracked sharp in the stillness

3048
02:50:15,280 --> 02:50:20,993
and sent the horse galloping and
gambolling to his night’s freedom.

3049
02:50:20,993 --> 02:50:25,856
And while the animal rolled in the grass,
often his master would roll also,

3050
02:50:25,856 --> 02:50:30,838
and stretch, and take the grass in his
two hands, and so draw his body along,

3051
02:50:30,838 --> 02:50:35,710
limbering his muscles after a long ride.

3052
02:50:35,710 --> 02:50:40,430
Then he would slide into the stream below
his fishing place, where it was deep

3053
02:50:40,430 --> 02:50:43,410
enough for swimming,
and cross back to his island,

3054
02:50:43,410 --> 02:50:49,676
and dressing again, fit his rod together
and begin his casting.

3055
02:50:49,676 --> 02:50:53,396
After the darkness had set in,
there would follow the lying drowsily

3056
02:50:53,396 --> 02:50:58,402
with his head upon his saddle,
the campfire sinking as he watched it,

3057
02:50:58,402 --> 02:51:02,584
and sleep approaching to the murmur of
the water on either side of him.

3058
02:51:02,584 --> 02:51:07,572
So many visits to this island had he
made, and counted so many hours of

3059
02:51:07,572 --> 02:51:12,793
revery spent in its haunting sweetness,
that the spot had come to seem his own.

3060
02:51:12,793 --> 02:51:16,513
It belonged to no man,
for it was deep in the unsurveyed and

3061
02:51:16,513 --> 02:51:21,475
virgin wilderness; neither had he ever
made his camp here with any man,

3062
02:51:21,475 --> 02:51:25,581
nor shared with any the intimate delight
which the place gave him.

3063
02:51:25,581 --> 02:51:31,307
Therefore for many weeks he had planned
to bring her here after their wedding,

3064
02:51:31,307 --> 02:51:36,071
upon the day itself,
and show her and share with her his

3065
02:51:36,071 --> 02:51:38,412
pines and his fishing rock.

3066
02:51:38,412 --> 02:51:41,565
He would bid her smell the first true
breath of the mountains,

3067
02:51:41,565 --> 02:51:44,838
would watch with her the sinking
campfire, and with her listen to the

3068
02:51:44,838 --> 02:51:47,094
water as it flowed round the island.

3069
02:51:47,094 --> 02:51:50,838
Until this wedding plan,
it had by no means come home to him how

3070
02:51:50,838 --> 02:51:54,059
deep a hold upon him
the island had taken.

3071
02:51:54,059 --> 02:51:57,612
He knew that he liked to go there,
and go alone; but so little was it his

3072
02:51:57,612 --> 02:52:02,256
way to scan himself,
his mind, or his feelings (unless some

3073
02:52:02,256 --> 02:52:05,212
action called for it),
that he first learned his love of the

3074
02:52:05,212 --> 02:52:07,080
place through his love of her.

3075
02:52:07,080 --> 02:52:09,701
But he told her nothing of it.

3076
02:52:09,701 --> 02:52:13,630
After the thought of taking her there
came to him, he kept his island as

3077
02:52:13,630 --> 02:52:18,312
something to let break upon her own
eyes, lest by looking forward she should

3078
02:52:18,312 --> 02:52:20,178
look for more than the reality.

3079
02:52:20,178 --> 02:52:24,074
Hence, as they rode along,
when the houses of the town were shrunk

3080
02:52:24,074 --> 02:52:27,282
to dots behind them,
and they were nearing the gates of the

3081
02:52:27,282 --> 02:52:31,528
foothills, she asked him questions.

3082
02:52:31,528 --> 02:52:35,998
She hoped they would find a camp a long
way from the town.

3083
02:52:35,998 --> 02:52:38,907
She could ride as many miles as necessary.

3084
02:52:38,907 --> 02:52:42,071
She was not tired.

3085
02:52:42,071 --> 02:52:45,363
Should they not go on until they found a
good place far enough

3086
02:52:45,363 --> 02:52:46,688
within the solitude?

3087
02:52:46,688 --> 02:52:48,483
Had he fixed upon any?

3088
02:52:48,483 --> 02:52:53,564
And at the nod and the silence that he
gave her for reply, she knew that he had

3089
02:52:53,564 --> 02:52:56,610
thoughts and intentions which she
must wait to learn.

3090
02:52:56,610 --> 02:52:59,978
They passed through the gates of the
foothills, following the

3091
02:52:59,978 --> 02:53:03,383
stream up among them.

3092
02:53:03,383 --> 02:53:07,979
The outstretching fences and the widely
trodden dust were no more.

3093
02:53:07,979 --> 02:53:13,351
Now and then they rose again into view of
the fields and houses down

3094
02:53:13,351 --> 02:53:14,413
in the plain below.

3095
02:53:14,413 --> 02:53:18,831
But as the sum of the miles and hours
grew, they were glad to see the road

3096
02:53:18,831 --> 02:53:23,301
less worn with travel,
and the traces of men passing from

3097
02:53:23,301 --> 02:53:23,983
sight.

3098
02:53:23,983 --> 02:53:28,413
The ploughed and planted country,
that quilt of many-colored harvests

3099
02:53:28,413 --> 02:53:32,013
which they had watched yesterday,
lay in another world from this

3100
02:53:32,013 --> 02:53:32,978
where they rode now.

3101
02:53:32,978 --> 02:53:37,988
No hand but nature’s had sown these crops
of yellow flowers, these willow

3102
02:53:37,988 --> 02:53:41,075
thickets and tall cottonwoods.

3103
02:53:41,075 --> 02:53:46,599
Somewhere in a passage of red rocks the
last sign of wagon wheels was lost,

3104
02:53:46,599 --> 02:53:51,255
and after this the trail became
a wild mountain trail.

3105
02:53:51,255 --> 02:53:56,514
But it was still the warm air of the
plains, bearing the sagebrush odor and

3106
02:53:56,514 --> 02:54:02,038
not the pine, that they breathed;
nor did any forest yet cloak the shapes

3107
02:54:02,038 --> 02:54:05,630
of the tawny hills among
which they were ascending.

3108
02:54:05,630 --> 02:54:09,525
Twice the steepness loosened the pack
ropes, and he jumped down to tighten

3109
02:54:09,525 --> 02:54:12,333
them, lest the horses
should get sore backs.

3110
02:54:12,333 --> 02:54:16,090
And twice the stream that they followed
went into deep canyons,

3111
02:54:16,090 --> 02:54:18,423
so that for a while they parted from it.

3112
02:54:18,423 --> 02:54:22,638
When they came back to its margin for the
second time, he bade her notice how its

3113
02:54:22,638 --> 02:54:25,778
water had become at last wholly clear.

3114
02:54:25,778 --> 02:54:30,822
To her it had seemed clear enough all
along, even in the plain above the town.

3115
02:54:30,822 --> 02:54:36,170
But now she saw that it flowed lustrously
with flashes; and she knew the soil had

3116
02:54:36,170 --> 02:54:38,277
changed to mountain soil.

3117
02:54:38,277 --> 02:54:42,146
Lower down, the water had carried the
slightest cloud of alkali,

3118
02:54:42,146 --> 02:54:45,664
and this had dulled the keen
edge of its transparence.

3119
02:54:45,664 --> 02:54:50,354
Full solitude was around them now,
so that their words grew scarce,

3120
02:54:50,354 --> 02:54:54,771
and when they spoke it
was with low voices.

3121
02:54:54,771 --> 02:54:58,395
They began to pass nooks and points
favorable for camping,

3122
02:54:58,395 --> 02:55:02,426
with wood and water at hand,
and pasture for the horses.

3123
02:55:02,426 --> 02:55:08,088
More than once as they reached such
places, she thought he must surely stop;

3124
02:55:08,088 --> 02:55:14,349
but still he rode on in advance of her
(for the trail was narrow) until,

3125
02:55:14,349 --> 02:55:18,603
when she was not thinking of it,
he drew rein and pointed.

3126
02:55:18,603 --> 02:55:19,180
“What?”

3127
02:55:19,180 --> 02:55:21,845
she asked timidly.

3128
02:55:21,845 --> 02:55:24,451
“The pines,” he answered.

3129
02:55:24,451 --> 02:55:30,098
She looked, and saw the island,
and the water folding it with ripples

3130
02:55:30,098 --> 02:55:31,860
and with smooth spaces.

3131
02:55:31,860 --> 02:55:37,610
The sun was throwing upon the pine boughs
a light of deepening red gold,

3132
02:55:37,610 --> 02:55:41,651
and the shadow of the fishing rock lay
over a little bay of quiet

3133
02:55:41,651 --> 02:55:43,454
water and sandy shore.

3134
02:55:43,454 --> 02:55:48,495
In this forerunning glow of the sunset,
the pasture spread like emerald;

3135
02:55:48,495 --> 02:55:51,601
for the dry touch of summer had not
yet come near it.

3136
02:55:51,601 --> 02:55:54,441
He pointed upward to the high mountains
which they had approached,

3137
02:55:54,441 --> 02:55:58,903
and showed her where the stream led
into their first unfoldings.

3138
02:55:58,903 --> 02:56:02,471
“Tomorrow we shall be
among them,” said he.

3139
02:56:02,471 --> 02:56:05,820
“Then,” she murmured to
him, “tonight is here?”

3140
02:56:05,820 --> 02:56:09,549
He nodded for answer,
and she gazed at the island and

3141
02:56:09,549 --> 02:56:13,749
understood why he had not stopped
before; nothing they had passed had been

3142
02:56:13,749 --> 02:56:15,527
so lovely as this place.

3143
02:56:15,527 --> 02:56:20,069
There was room in the trail for them to
go side by side; and side by side they

3144
02:56:20,069 --> 02:56:25,700
rode to the ford and crossed,
driving the packhorses in front of them,

3145
02:56:25,700 --> 02:56:30,119
until they came to the sheltered circle,
and he helped her down where the

3146
02:56:30,119 --> 02:56:32,151
soft pine needles lay.

3147
02:56:32,151 --> 02:56:38,629
They felt each other tremble,
and for a moment she stood hiding her

3148
02:56:38,629 --> 02:56:40,384
head upon his breast.

3149
02:56:40,384 --> 02:56:45,215
Then she looked round at the trees,
and the shores, and the flowing stream,

3150
02:56:45,215 --> 02:56:48,256
and he heard her whispering
how beautiful it was.

3151
02:56:48,256 --> 02:56:52,935
“I am glad,” he said, still holding her.

3152
02:56:52,935 --> 02:56:57,486
“This is how I have dreamed
it would happen.

3153
02:56:57,486 --> 02:57:00,611
Only it is better than my dreams.”

3154
02:57:00,611 --> 02:57:04,629
And when she pressed him in silence,
he finished, “I have meant we should see

3155
02:57:04,629 --> 02:57:08,485
our first sundown here,
and our first sunrise.”

3156
02:57:08,485 --> 02:57:12,714
She wished to help him take the packs
from their horses, to make the camp

3157
02:57:12,714 --> 02:57:17,799
together with him, to have for her share
the building of the fire,

3158
02:57:17,799 --> 02:57:18,726
and the cooking.

3159
02:57:18,726 --> 02:57:24,169
She bade him remember his promise to her
that he would teach her how to loop and

3160
02:57:24,169 --> 02:57:28,917
draw the pack-ropes,
and the swing-ropes on the packsaddles,

3161
02:57:28,917 --> 02:57:30,507
and how to pitch a tent.

3162
02:57:30,507 --> 02:57:33,121
Why might not the first lesson be now?

3163
02:57:33,121 --> 02:57:36,110
But he told her that this
should be fulfilled later.

3164
02:57:36,110 --> 02:57:39,055
This night he was to do all himself.

3165
02:57:39,055 --> 02:57:42,793
And he sent her away until he should have
camp ready for them.

3166
02:57:42,793 --> 02:57:47,096
He bade her explore the island,
or take her horse and ride over to the

3167
02:57:47,096 --> 02:57:50,507
pasture, where she could see the
surrounding hills and the circle of

3168
02:57:50,507 --> 02:57:52,570
seclusion that they made.

3169
02:57:52,570 --> 02:57:56,054
“The whole world is far
from here,” he said.

3170
02:57:56,054 --> 02:57:59,319
And so she obeyed him,
and went away to wander about in their

3171
02:57:59,319 --> 02:58:05,177
hiding-place; nor was she to return,
he told her, until he called her.

3172
02:58:05,177 --> 02:58:09,202
Then at once, as soon as she was
gone, he fell to.

3173
02:58:09,202 --> 02:58:14,374
The packs and saddles came off the
horses, which he turned loose upon the

3174
02:58:14,374 --> 02:58:16,688
pasture on the main land.

3175
02:58:16,688 --> 02:58:19,574
The tent was unfolded first.

3176
02:58:19,574 --> 02:58:23,494
He had long seen in his mind where it
should go, and how its white shape would

3177
02:58:23,494 --> 02:58:26,716
look beneath the green
of the encircling pines.

3178
02:58:26,716 --> 02:58:31,925
The ground was level in the spot he had
chosen, without stones or roots,

3179
02:58:31,925 --> 02:58:34,912
and matted with the fallen
needles of the pines.

3180
02:58:34,912 --> 02:58:39,095
If there should come any wind,
or storm of rain, the branches were

3181
02:58:39,095 --> 02:58:43,101
thick overhead, and around them on three
sides tall rocks and

3182
02:58:43,101 --> 02:58:44,825
undergrowth made a barrier.

3183
02:58:44,825 --> 02:58:49,072
He cut the pegs for the tent,
and the front pole, stretching and

3184
02:58:49,072 --> 02:58:52,836
tightening the rope,
one end of it pegged down and one

3185
02:58:52,836 --> 02:58:54,247
round a pine tree.

3186
02:58:54,247 --> 02:58:58,396
When the tightening rope had lifted the
canvas to the proper height from the

3187
02:58:58,396 --> 02:59:04,251
ground, he spread and pegged down the
sides and back, leaving the opening so

3188
02:59:04,251 --> 02:59:09,446
that they could look out upon the fire
and a piece of the stream beyond.

3189
02:59:09,446 --> 02:59:14,746
He cut tufts of young pine and strewed
them thickly for a soft floor in the

3190
02:59:14,746 --> 02:59:20,294
tent, and over them spread the buffalo
hide and the blankets.

3191
02:59:20,294 --> 02:59:24,094
At the head he placed the neat
sack of her belongings.

3192
02:59:24,094 --> 02:59:28,303
For his own he made a shelter with
crossed poles and a sheet of canvas

3193
02:59:28,303 --> 02:59:29,740
beyond the first pines.

3194
02:59:29,740 --> 02:59:35,918
He built the fire where its smoke would
float outward from the trees and the

3195
02:59:35,918 --> 02:59:41,544
tent, and near it he stood the cooking
things and his provisions,

3196
02:59:41,544 --> 02:59:44,861
and made this first supper
ready in the twilight.

3197
02:59:44,861 --> 02:59:47,406
He had brought much with him;
but for ten minutes he

3198
02:59:47,406 --> 02:59:49,799
fished, catching trout enough.

3199
02:59:49,799 --> 02:59:53,519
When at length she came riding over the
stream at his call, there was nothing

3200
02:59:53,519 --> 02:59:57,120
for her to do but sit and eat at the
table he had laid.

3201
02:59:57,120 --> 03:00:01,159
They sat together, watching the last of
the twilight and the gentle

3202
03:00:01,159 --> 03:00:02,711
oncoming of the dusk.

3203
03:00:02,711 --> 03:00:07,182
The final afterglow of day left the sky,
and through the purple which followed it

3204
03:00:07,182 --> 03:00:11,747
came slowly the first stars,
bright and wide apart.

3205
03:00:11,747 --> 03:00:17,457
They watched the spaces between them fill
with more stars, while near them the

3206
03:00:17,457 --> 03:00:23,716
flames and embers of
their fire grew brighter.

3207
03:00:23,716 --> 03:00:28,157
Then he sent her to the tent while he
cleaned the dishes and visited the

3208
03:00:28,157 --> 03:00:32,194
horses to see that they did not
stray from the pasture.

3209
03:00:32,194 --> 03:00:38,251
Some while after the darkness was fully
come, he rejoined her.

3210
03:00:38,251 --> 03:00:42,625
All had been as he had seen it in his
thoughts beforehand:

3211
03:00:42,625 --> 03:00:46,438
the pines with the setting sun upon
them, the sinking campfire,

3212
03:00:46,438 --> 03:00:50,745
and now the sound of the water as it
flowed murmuring by the

3213
03:00:50,745 --> 03:00:51,383
shores of the island.

3214
03:00:51,383 --> 03:00:54,910
The tent opened to the east,
and from it they watched

3215
03:00:54,910 --> 03:00:57,792
together their first sunrise.

3216
03:00:57,792 --> 03:01:01,649
In his thoughts he had seen this morning
beforehand also: the waking,

3217
03:01:01,649 --> 03:01:06,200
the gentle sound of the water murmuring
ceaselessly, the growing day,

3218
03:01:06,200 --> 03:01:09,504
the vision of the stream,
the sense that the world was shut

3219
03:01:09,504 --> 03:01:10,887
away far from them.

3220
03:01:10,887 --> 03:01:14,576
So did it all happen,
except that he whispered to her again:⁠—

3221
03:01:14,576 --> 03:01:17,024
“Better than my dreams.”

3222
03:01:17,024 --> 03:01:21,144
They saw the sunlight begin upon a
hilltop; and presently came the sun

3223
03:01:21,144 --> 03:01:27,681
itself, and lakes of warmth flowed into
the air, slowly filling

3224
03:01:27,681 --> 03:01:29,774
the green solitude.

3225
03:01:29,774 --> 03:01:35,875
Along the island shores the ripples
caught flashes from the sun.

3226
03:01:35,875 --> 03:01:39,637
“I am going into the stream,”
he said to her; and rising,

3227
03:01:39,637 --> 03:01:40,905
he left her in the tent.

3228
03:01:40,905 --> 03:01:44,499
This was his side of the island,
he had told her last night;

3229
03:01:44,499 --> 03:01:48,456
the other was hers, where he had made a
place for her to bathe.

3230
03:01:48,456 --> 03:01:54,635
When he was gone, she found it,
walking through the trees and rocks

3231
03:01:54,635 --> 03:01:56,109
to the water’s edge.

3232
03:01:56,109 --> 03:02:01,063
And so, with the island between them,
the two bathed in the cold stream.

3233
03:02:01,063 --> 03:02:05,227
When he came back, he found her already
busy at their camp.

3234
03:02:05,227 --> 03:02:09,302
The blue smoke of the fire was floating
out from the trees, loitering

3235
03:02:09,302 --> 03:02:13,123
undispersed in the quiet air,
and she was getting their breakfast.

3236
03:02:13,123 --> 03:02:16,697
She had been able to forestall him
because he had delayed long at his

3237
03:02:16,697 --> 03:02:20,757
dressing, not willing to
return to her unshaven.

3238
03:02:20,757 --> 03:02:24,710
She looked at his eyes that were clear as
the water he had leaped into,

3239
03:02:24,710 --> 03:02:28,907
and at his soft silk
neckerchief, knotted with care.

3240
03:02:28,907 --> 03:02:31,252
“Do not let us ever go away from here!”

3241
03:02:31,252 --> 03:02:34,594
she cried, and ran to him as he came.

3242
03:02:34,594 --> 03:02:38,349
They sat long together at breakfast,
breathing the morning breath of the

3243
03:02:38,349 --> 03:02:43,407
earth that was fragrant with woodland
moisture and with the pines.

3244
03:02:43,407 --> 03:02:46,691
After the meal he could not prevent her
helping him make everything clean.

3245
03:02:46,691 --> 03:02:51,276
Then, by all customs of mountain
journeys, it was time they should break

3246
03:02:51,276 --> 03:02:55,147
camp and be moving before the
heat of the day.

3247
03:02:55,147 --> 03:03:00,394
But first, they delayed for no reason,
save that in these hours they so

3248
03:03:00,394 --> 03:03:02,266
loved to do nothing.

3249
03:03:02,266 --> 03:03:08,102
And next, when with some energy he got
upon his feet and declared he must go

3250
03:03:08,102 --> 03:03:11,488
and drive the horses in, she asked, Why?

3251
03:03:11,488 --> 03:03:14,606
Would it not be well for him to fish
here, that they might be sure of

3252
03:03:14,606 --> 03:03:15,848
trout at their nooning?

3253
03:03:15,848 --> 03:03:21,839
And though he knew that where they should
stop for noon, trout would be as sure as

3254
03:03:21,839 --> 03:03:24,770
here, he took this chance for more
delay.

3255
03:03:24,770 --> 03:03:28,506
She went with him to his fishing rock,
and sat watching him.

3256
03:03:28,506 --> 03:03:32,427
The rock was tall, higher than his
head when he stood.

3257
03:03:32,427 --> 03:03:36,634
It jutted out halfway across the stream,
and the water flowed round it in quick

3258
03:03:36,634 --> 03:03:39,016
foam, and fell into a pool.

3259
03:03:39,016 --> 03:03:40,379
He caught several fish;

3260
03:03:40,379 --> 03:03:45,159
but the sun was getting high,
and after a time it was plain the fish

3261
03:03:45,159 --> 03:03:46,547
had ceased to rise.

3262
03:03:46,547 --> 03:03:54,008
Yet still he stood casting in silence,
while she sat by and watched him.

3263
03:03:54,008 --> 03:03:58,383
Across the stream, the horses wandered or
lay down in their pasture.

3264
03:03:58,383 --> 03:04:03,100
At length he said with half a sigh that
perhaps they ought to go.

3265
03:04:03,100 --> 03:04:03,740
“Ought?”

3266
03:04:03,740 --> 03:04:05,519
she repeated softly.

3267
03:04:05,519 --> 03:04:08,387
“If we are to get anywhere
today,” he answered.

3268
03:04:08,387 --> 03:04:09,682
“Need we get anywhere?”

3269
03:04:09,682 --> 03:04:10,431
she asked.

3270
03:04:10,431 --> 03:04:13,566
Her question sent delight through
him like a flood.

3271
03:04:13,566 --> 03:04:16,281
“Then you do not want to move camp today?”

3272
03:04:16,281 --> 03:04:17,180
said he.

3273
03:04:17,180 --> 03:04:18,793
She shook her head.

3274
03:04:18,793 --> 03:04:24,485
At this he laid down his rod and came
and sat by her.

3275
03:04:24,485 --> 03:04:28,453
“I am very glad we shall not go
till tomorrow,” he murmured.

3276
03:04:28,453 --> 03:04:31,278
“Not tomorrow,” she said.

3277
03:04:31,278 --> 03:04:33,245
“Nor next day.

3278
03:04:33,245 --> 03:04:36,191
Nor any day until we must.”

3279
03:04:36,191 --> 03:04:40,741
And she stretched her hands out to the
island and the stream exclaiming,

3280
03:04:40,741 --> 03:04:42,684
“Nothing can surpass this!”

3281
03:04:42,684 --> 03:04:43,949
He took her in his arms.

3282
03:04:43,949 --> 03:04:47,081
“You feel about it the way I
do,” he almost whispered.

3283
03:04:47,081 --> 03:04:51,843
“I could not have hoped there’d be two of
us to care so much.”

3284
03:04:51,843 --> 03:04:57,419
Presently, while they remained without
speaking by the pool,

3285
03:04:57,419 --> 03:05:00,892
came a little wild animal swimming round
the rock from above.

3286
03:05:00,892 --> 03:05:05,566
It had not seen them,
nor suspected their presence.

3287
03:05:05,566 --> 03:05:09,162
They held themselves still,
watching its alert head cross through

3288
03:05:09,162 --> 03:05:16,381
the waves quickly and come down through
the pool, and so swim to the other side.

3289
03:05:16,381 --> 03:05:21,270
There it came out on a small stretch of
sand, turned its gray head and its

3290
03:05:21,270 --> 03:05:26,798
pointed black nose this way and that,
never seeing them, and then rolled upon

3291
03:05:26,798 --> 03:05:29,143
its back in the warm dry sand.

3292
03:05:29,143 --> 03:05:32,418
After a minute of rolling,
it got on its feet again,

3293
03:05:32,418 --> 03:05:34,562
shook its fur, and trotted away.

3294
03:05:34,562 --> 03:05:39,404
Then the bridegroom husband opened his
shy heart deep down.

3295
03:05:39,404 --> 03:05:42,215
“I am like that fellow,” he said dreamily.

3296
03:05:42,215 --> 03:05:43,986
“I have often done the same.”

3297
03:05:43,986 --> 03:05:49,525
And stretching slowly his arms and legs,
he lay full length upon his back,

3298
03:05:49,525 --> 03:05:51,982
letting his head rest upon her.

3299
03:05:51,982 --> 03:05:56,245
“If I could talk his animal language,
I could talk to him,” he pursued.

3300
03:05:56,245 --> 03:06:00,550
“And he would say to me:
‘Come and roll on the sands.

3301
03:06:00,550 --> 03:06:02,068
Where’s the use of fretting?

3302
03:06:02,068 --> 03:06:04,128
What’s the gain in being a man?

3303
03:06:04,128 --> 03:06:05,735
Come roll on the sands with me.’

3304
03:06:05,735 --> 03:06:06,950
That’s what he would say.”

3305
03:06:06,950 --> 03:06:07,350
The Virginian paused.

3306
03:06:07,350 --> 03:06:11,881
“But,” he continued, “the trouble
is, I am responsible.

3307
03:06:11,881 --> 03:06:15,105
If that could only be forgot forever
by you and me!”

3308
03:06:15,105 --> 03:06:18,803
Again he paused and went
on, always dreamily.

3309
03:06:18,803 --> 03:06:22,817
“Often when I have camped here,
it has made me want to become the

3310
03:06:22,817 --> 03:06:28,400
ground, become the water,
become the trees, mix

3311
03:06:28,400 --> 03:06:29,782
with the whole thing.

3312
03:06:29,782 --> 03:06:32,171
Not know myself from it.

3313
03:06:32,171 --> 03:06:34,971
Never unmix again.

3314
03:06:34,971 --> 03:06:36,874
Why is that?”

3315
03:06:36,874 --> 03:06:42,214
he demanded, looking at her.

3316
03:06:42,214 --> 03:06:43,956
“What is it?

3317
03:06:43,956 --> 03:06:47,968
You don’t know, nor I don’t.

3318
03:06:47,968 --> 03:06:50,528
I wonder would everybody
feel that way here?”

3319
03:06:50,528 --> 03:06:53,795
“I think not everybody,” she answered.

3320
03:06:53,795 --> 03:06:58,075
“No; none except the ones who understand
things they can’t put words to.

3321
03:06:58,075 --> 03:06:59,204
But you did!”

3322
03:06:59,204 --> 03:07:02,468
He put up a hand and touched her softly.

3323
03:07:02,468 --> 03:07:05,520
“You understood about this place.

3324
03:07:05,520 --> 03:07:10,680
And that’s what makes it⁠—makes you and
me as we are now⁠—better than my dreams.

3325
03:07:10,680 --> 03:07:12,769
And my dreams were pretty good.”

3326
03:07:12,769 --> 03:07:17,634
He sighed with supreme quiet and
happiness, and seemed to stretch his

3327
03:07:17,634 --> 03:07:19,484
length closer to the earth.

3328
03:07:19,484 --> 03:07:23,994
And so he lay, and talked to her as he
had never talked to anyone,

3329
03:07:23,994 --> 03:07:25,663
not even to himself.

3330
03:07:25,663 --> 03:07:30,474
Thus she learned secrets of his heart new
to her: his visits here,

3331
03:07:30,474 --> 03:07:33,314
what they were to him,
and why he had chosen it

3332
03:07:33,314 --> 03:07:34,736
for their bridal camp.

3333
03:07:34,736 --> 03:07:38,334
“What I did not know at all,”
he said, “was the way a man can be

3334
03:07:38,334 --> -1:59:59,000
pining for⁠—for this⁠—and never guess
what is the matter with him

3335
-1:59:59,000 --> -1:59:59,000
.

3336
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3337
03:07:42,170 --> 03:07:46,469
When he had finished talking,
still he lay extended and serene;

3338
03:07:46,469 --> 03:07:49,835
and she looked down at him and the
wonderful change that had come over

3339
03:07:49,835 --> 03:07:51,637
him, like a sunrise.

3340
03:07:51,637 --> 03:07:55,890
Was this dreamy boy the man
of two days ago?

3341
03:07:55,890 --> 03:07:59,716
It seemed a distance immeasurable;
yet it was two days only since that

3342
03:07:59,716 --> 03:08:05,416
wedding eve when she had shrunk from him
as he stood fierce and implacable.

3343
03:08:05,416 --> 03:08:09,450
She could look back at that dark hour
now, although she could not speak of it.

3344
03:08:09,450 --> 03:08:14,896
She had seen destruction like sharp steel
glittering in his eyes.

3345
03:08:14,896 --> 03:08:16,807
Were these the same eyes?

3346
03:08:16,807 --> 03:08:23,390
Was this youth with his black head of
hair in her lap the creature with whom

3347
03:08:23,390 --> 03:08:28,511
men did not trifle, whose hand knew
how to deal death?

3348
03:08:28,511 --> 03:08:34,672
Where had the man melted away
to in this boy?

3349
03:08:34,672 --> 03:08:39,168
For as she looked at him,
he might have been no

3350
03:08:39,168 --> 03:08:41,568
older than nineteen today.

3351
03:08:41,568 --> 03:08:46,750
Not even at their first meeting⁠—that
night when his freakish spirit was

3352
03:08:46,750 --> 03:08:48,943
uppermost⁠—had he looked so young.

3353
03:08:48,943 --> 03:08:52,510
This change their hours upon the island
had wrought, filling

3354
03:08:52,510 --> 03:08:56,134
his face with innocence.

3355
03:08:56,134 --> 03:08:59,741
By and by they made their nooning.

3356
03:08:59,741 --> 03:09:04,523
In the afternoon she would have explored
the nearer woods with him,

3357
03:09:04,523 --> 03:09:06,316
or walked up the stream.

3358
03:09:06,316 --> 03:09:10,259
But since this was to be their camp
during several days,

3359
03:09:10,259 --> 03:09:11,575
he made it more complete.

3360
03:09:11,575 --> 03:09:17,479
He fashioned a rough bench and a table;
around their tent he built a tall

3361
03:09:17,479 --> 03:09:22,712
windbreak for better shelter in case of
storm; and for the fire he gathered and

3362
03:09:22,712 --> 03:09:25,287
cut much wood, and piled it up.

3363
03:09:25,287 --> 03:09:29,233
So they were provided for,
and so for six days and nights they

3364
03:09:29,233 --> 03:09:33,812
stayed, finding no day
or night long enough.

3365
03:09:33,812 --> 03:09:37,357
Once his hedge of boughs did them good
service, for they had an

3366
03:09:37,357 --> 03:09:39,277
afternoon of furious storm.

3367
03:09:39,277 --> 03:09:44,690
The wind rocked the pines and ransacked
the island, the sun went out,

3368
03:09:44,690 --> 03:09:48,329
the black clouds rattled,
and white bolts of lightning

3369
03:09:48,329 --> 03:09:49,537
fell close by.

3370
03:09:49,537 --> 03:09:53,951
The shower broke through the pine
branches and poured upon the tent.

3371
03:09:53,951 --> 03:09:58,309
But he had removed everything inside from
where it could touch the canvas and so

3372
03:09:58,309 --> 03:10:01,390
lead the water through,
and the rain ran off into the ditch he

3373
03:10:01,390 --> 03:10:02,896
had dug round the tent.

3374
03:10:02,896 --> 03:10:06,700
While they sat within,
looking out upon the bounding floods and

3375
03:10:06,700 --> 03:10:09,420
the white lightning,
she saw him glance at her

3376
03:10:09,420 --> 03:10:12,742
apprehensively, and at once
she answered his glance.

3377
03:10:12,742 --> 03:10:14,733
“I am not afraid,” she said.

3378
03:10:14,733 --> 03:10:18,221
“If a flame should consume us together
now, what would it matter?”

3379
03:10:18,221 --> 03:10:22,932
And so they sat watching the storm till
it was over, he with his face changed by

3380
03:10:22,932 --> 03:10:25,262
her to a boy’s, and she
leavened with him.

3381
03:10:25,262 --> 03:10:29,253
When at last they were compelled to leave
the island, or see no more of the

3382
03:10:29,253 --> 03:10:32,659
mountains, it was not a final parting.

3383
03:10:32,659 --> 03:10:36,121
They would come back for the last night
before their journey ended.

3384
03:10:36,121 --> 03:10:39,828
Furthermore, they promised each other
like two children to come here every

3385
03:10:39,828 --> 03:10:43,203
year upon their wedding day,
and like two children they believed that

3386
03:10:43,203 --> 03:10:45,108
this would be possible.

3387
03:10:45,108 --> 03:10:51,991
But in after years they did come,
more than once, to keep their wedding

3388
03:10:51,991 --> 03:10:56,174
day upon the island,
and upon each new visit were able to say

3389
03:10:56,174 --> 03:11:00,351
to each other, “Better than our dreams.”

3390
03:11:00,351 --> 03:11:07,445
For thirty days by the light of the sun
and the campfire light they saw no faces

3391
03:11:07,445 --> 03:11:11,493
except their own; and when they were
silent it was all stillness,

3392
03:11:11,493 --> 03:11:16,960
unless the wind passed among the pines,
or some flowing water was near them.

3393
03:11:16,960 --> 03:11:21,683
Sometimes at evening they came upon elk,
or black-tailed deer,

3394
03:11:21,683 --> 03:11:26,657
feeding out in the high parks of the
mountains; and once from the edge of

3395
03:11:26,657 --> 03:11:31,985
some concealing timber he showed her a
bear, sitting with an old log

3396
03:11:31,985 --> 03:11:33,831
lifted in its paws.

3397
03:11:33,831 --> 03:11:37,124
She forbade him to kill the bear,
or any creature that

3398
03:11:37,124 --> 03:11:38,390
they did not require.

3399
03:11:38,390 --> 03:11:43,846
He took her upward by trail and canyon,
through the unfooted woods and along

3400
03:11:43,846 --> 03:11:49,407
dwindling streams to their headwaters,
lakes lying near the summit of the

3401
03:11:49,407 --> 03:11:54,433
range, full of trout,
with meadows of long grass and a

3402
03:11:54,433 --> 03:12:00,595
thousand flowers, and above these the
pinnacles of rock and snow.

3403
03:12:00,595 --> 03:12:05,630
They made their camps in many places,
delaying several days here,

3404
03:12:05,630 --> 03:12:10,078
and one night there,
exploring the high solitudes together,

3405
03:12:10,078 --> 03:12:12,166
and sinking deep in their romance.

3406
03:12:12,166 --> 03:12:17,158
Sometimes when he was at work with their
horses, or intent on casting his brown

3407
03:12:17,158 --> 03:12:22,003
hackle for a fish, she would watch him
with eyes that were fuller of

3408
03:12:22,003 --> 03:12:24,091
love than of understanding.

3409
03:12:24,091 --> 03:12:28,124
Perhaps she never came wholly to
understand him; but in her complete love

3410
03:12:28,124 --> 03:12:29,933
for him she found enough.

3411
03:12:29,933 --> 03:12:32,610
He loved her with his whole man’s power.

3412
03:12:32,610 --> 03:12:36,564
She had listened to him tell her in words
of transport, “I could enjoy dying”; yet

3413
03:12:36,564 --> 03:12:38,089
she loved him more than that.

3414
03:12:38,089 --> 03:12:42,574
He had come to her from a smoking pistol,
able to bid her farewell⁠—and she could

3415
03:12:42,574 --> 03:12:43,595
not let him go.

3416
03:12:43,595 --> 03:12:48,788
At the last white-hot edge of ordeal,
it was she who renounced,

3417
03:12:48,788 --> 03:12:50,908
and he who had his way.

3418
03:12:50,908 --> 03:12:56,959
Nevertheless she found much more than
enough, in spite of the sigh that now

3419
03:12:56,959 --> 03:13:03,484
and again breathed through her happiness
when she would watch him with eyes

3420
03:13:03,484 --> 03:13:07,443
fuller of love than of understanding.

3421
03:13:07,443 --> 03:13:11,289
They could not speak of that grim wedding
eve for a long while after;

3422
03:13:11,289 --> 03:13:18,288
but the mountains brought them together
upon all else in the world

3423
03:13:18,288 --> 03:13:20,120
and their own lives.

3424
03:13:20,120 --> 03:13:24,176
At the end they loved each other doubly
more than at the beginning,

3425
03:13:24,176 --> 03:13:28,790
because of these added confidences which
they exchanged and shared.

3426
03:13:28,790 --> 03:13:33,967
It was a new bliss to her to know a man’s
talk and thoughts, to be given so much

3427
03:13:33,967 --> 03:13:38,598
of him; and to him it was a bliss still
greater to melt from that reserve his

3428
03:13:38,598 --> 03:13:40,924
lonely life had bred in him.

3429
03:13:40,924 --> 03:13:44,371
He never would have guessed so much had
been stored away in him,

3430
03:13:44,371 --> 03:13:46,228
unexpressed till now.

3431
03:13:46,228 --> 03:13:50,339
They did not want to go to Vermont and
leave these mountains,

3432
03:13:50,339 --> 03:13:54,202
but the day came when they had to turn
their backs upon their dream.

3433
03:13:54,202 --> 03:13:58,106
So they came out into the plains once
more, well established in their

3434
03:13:58,106 --> 03:14:03,587
familiarity, with only the journey still
lying between themselves and Bennington.

3435
03:14:03,587 --> 03:14:06,437
“If you could,” she said, laughing.

3436
03:14:06,437 --> 03:14:08,723
“If only you could ride home like this.”

3437
03:14:08,723 --> 03:14:10,757
“With Monte and my six-shooter?”

3438
03:14:10,757 --> 03:14:11,487
he asked.

3439
03:14:11,487 --> 03:14:12,497
“To your mother?”

3440
03:14:12,497 --> 03:14:16,071
“I don’t think mother could resist the
way you look on a horse.”

3441
03:14:16,071 --> 03:14:21,148
But he said, “It’s this way she’s
fearing I will come.”

3442
03:14:21,148 --> 03:14:24,206
“I have made one discovery,” she said.

3443
03:14:24,206 --> 03:14:26,641
“You are fonder of good
clothes than I am.”

3444
03:14:26,641 --> 03:14:27,424
He grinned.

3445
03:14:27,424 --> 03:14:31,209
“I cert’nly like ’em.

3446
03:14:31,209 --> 03:14:39,102
But don’t tell my friends.

3447
03:14:39,102 --> 03:14:41,810
They would say it was marriage.

3448
03:14:41,810 --> 03:14:45,137
When you see what I have got for
Bennington’s special benefit,

3449
03:14:45,137 --> 03:14:49,170
you⁠—why, you’ll just trust your
husband more than ever.”

3450
03:14:49,170 --> 03:14:50,490
She undoubtedly did.

3451
03:14:50,490 --> 03:14:54,951
After he had put on one particular suit,
she arose and kissed him where

3452
03:14:54,951 --> 03:14:55,935
he stood in it.

3453
03:14:55,935 --> 03:14:58,301
“Bennington will be sorrowful,” he said.

3454
03:14:58,301 --> 03:15:01,824
“No wild-west show, after all.

3455
03:15:01,824 --> 03:15:04,025
And no ready-made guy, either.”

3456
03:15:04,025 --> 03:15:07,276
And he looked at himself in the
glass with unbidden pleasure.

3457
03:15:07,276 --> 03:15:08,996
“How did you choose that?”

3458
03:15:08,996 --> 03:15:10,476
she asked.

3459
03:15:10,476 --> 03:15:14,216
“How did you know that homespun was
exactly the thing for you?”

3460
03:15:14,216 --> 03:15:16,723
“Why, I have been noticing.

3461
03:15:16,723 --> 03:15:21,718
I used to despise an Eastern man because
his clothes were not Western.

3462
03:15:21,718 --> 03:15:24,799
I was very young then,
or maybe not so very young,

3463
03:15:24,799 --> 03:15:29,914
as very⁠—as what you saw I was when you
first came to Bear Creek.

3464
03:15:29,914 --> 03:15:33,312
A Western man is a good thing.

3465
03:15:33,312 --> 03:15:36,513
And he generally knows that.

3466
03:15:36,513 --> 03:15:40,633
But he has a heap to learn.

3467
03:15:40,633 --> 03:15:46,225
And he generally don’t know that.

3468
03:15:46,225 --> 03:15:49,484
So I took to watching
the Judge’s Eastern visitors.

3469
03:15:49,484 --> 03:15:55,477
There was that Mr. Ogden especially,
from New Yawk⁠—the gentleman that was

3470
03:15:55,477 --> 03:16:00,751
there the time when I had to sit up all
night with the missionary, yu’ know.

3471
03:16:00,751 --> 03:16:03,059
His clothes pleased me best of all.

3472
03:16:03,059 --> 03:16:05,957
Fit him so well, and nothing flash.

3473
03:16:05,957 --> 03:16:09,241
I got my ideas, and when I knew I was
going to marry you, I sent

3474
03:16:09,241 --> 03:16:10,610
my measure East⁠—and

3475
03:16:10,610 --> 03:16:13,571
I and the tailor are old enemies now.”

3476
03:16:13,571 --> 03:16:15,684
Bennington probably was disappointed.

3477
03:16:15,684 --> 03:16:20,729
To see get out of the train merely a tall
man with a usual straw hat,

3478
03:16:20,729 --> 03:16:24,907
and Scotch homespun suit of a rather
better cut than most in

3479
03:16:24,907 --> 03:16:26,467
Bennington⁠—this was dull.

3480
03:16:26,467 --> 03:16:30,798
And his conversation⁠—when he indulged in
any⁠—seemed fit to come inside the

3481
03:16:30,798 --> 03:16:31,484
house.

3482
03:16:31,484 --> 03:16:31,879
Mrs.

3483
03:16:31,879 --> 03:16:38,826
Flynt took her revenge by sowing
broadcast her thankfulness that poor Sam

3484
03:16:38,826 --> 03:16:42,885
Bannett had been Molly’s rejected
suitor.

3485
03:16:42,885 --> 03:16:46,387
He had done so much better for himself.

3486
03:16:46,387 --> 03:16:50,810
Sam had married a rich Miss Van Scootzer,
of the second families of Troy;

3487
03:16:50,810 --> 03:16:54,049
and with their combined riches this
happy couple still inhabit the most

3488
03:16:54,049 --> 03:16:57,129
expensive residence in Hoosic Falls.

3489
03:16:57,129 --> 03:17:02,353
But most of Bennington soon began to say
that Molly’s cowboy could be invited

3490
03:17:02,353 --> 03:17:03,993
anywhere and hold his own.

3491
03:17:03,993 --> 03:17:07,833
The time came when they ceased to speak
of him as a cowboy, and declared that

3492
03:17:07,833 --> 03:17:10,313
she had shown remarkable sense.

3493
03:17:10,313 --> 03:17:12,223
But this was not quite yet.

3494
03:17:12,223 --> 03:17:15,744
Did this bride and groom enjoy their
visit to her family?

3495
03:17:15,744 --> 03:17:19,107
Well⁠—well, they did their best.

3496
03:17:19,107 --> 03:17:21,814
Everybody did their best, even Sarah Bell.

3497
03:17:21,814 --> 03:17:28,285
She said that she found nothing to object
to in the Virginian; she told Molly so.

3498
03:17:28,285 --> 03:17:30,805
Her husband Sam did better than that.

3499
03:17:30,805 --> 03:17:34,005
He told Molly he considered that
she was in luck.

3500
03:17:34,005 --> 03:17:40,351
And poor Mrs. Wood, sitting on the sofa,
conversed scrupulously and timidly with

3501
03:17:40,351 --> 03:17:43,351
her novel son-in-law,
and said to Molly that she was

3502
03:17:43,351 --> 03:17:46,052
astonished to find him so gentle.

3503
03:17:46,052 --> 03:17:49,855
And he was undoubtedly fine-
looking; yes, very handsome.

3504
03:17:49,855 --> 03:17:54,615
She believed that she would grow to
like the Southern accent.

3505
03:17:54,615 --> 03:17:56,698
Oh, yes!

3506
03:17:56,698 --> 03:18:00,158
Everybody did their best;
and, dear reader, if ever it has been

3507
03:18:00,158 --> 03:18:04,559
your earthly portion to live with a
number of people who were all doing

3508
03:18:04,559 --> 03:18:08,239
their best, you do not need me to tell
you what a heavenly atmosphere

3509
03:18:08,239 --> 03:18:09,385
this creates.

3510
03:18:09,385 --> 03:18:14,709
And then the bride and groom went to see
the old great-aunt over at Dunbarton.

3511
03:18:14,709 --> 03:18:19,425
Their first arrival, the one at
Bennington, had been thus:

3512
03:18:19,425 --> 03:18:23,795
Sam Bell had met them at the train,
and Mrs. Wood, waiting in her parlor,

3513
03:18:23,795 --> 03:18:26,846
had embraced her daughter and received
her son-in-law.

3514
03:18:26,846 --> 03:18:31,769
Among them they had managed to make the
occasion as completely mournful as any

3515
03:18:31,769 --> 03:18:34,649
family party can be,
with the window blinds up.

3516
03:18:34,649 --> 03:18:39,197
“And with you present,
my dear,” said Sam Bell to Sarah,

3517
03:18:39,197 --> 03:18:41,485
“the absence of a coffin was not felt.”

3518
03:18:41,485 --> 03:18:44,713
But at Dunbarton the affair
went off differently.

3519
03:18:44,713 --> 03:18:49,559
The heart of the ancient lady had
taught her better things.

3520
03:18:49,559 --> 03:18:54,224
From Bennington to Dunbarton is the good
part of a day’s journey,

3521
03:18:54,224 --> 03:18:56,769
and they drove up to the
gate in the afternoon.

3522
03:18:56,769 --> 03:19:01,898
The great-aunt was in her garden,
picking some August flowers,

3523
03:19:01,898 --> 03:19:05,607
and she called as the carriage stopped,
“Bring my nephew here,

3524
03:19:05,607 --> 03:19:09,111
my dear, before you go into the house.”

3525
03:19:09,111 --> 03:19:15,238
At this, Molly, stepping out of the
carriage, squeezed her husband’s hand.

3526
03:19:15,238 --> 03:19:18,438
“I knew that she would be lovely,”
she whispered to him.

3527
03:19:18,438 --> 03:19:22,156
And then she ran to her aunt’s arms,
and let him follow.

3528
03:19:22,156 --> 03:19:25,602
He came slowly, hat in hand.

3529
03:19:25,602 --> 03:19:29,915
The old lady advanced to meet him,
trembling a little, and holding out

3530
03:19:29,915 --> 03:19:30,965
her hand to him.

3531
03:19:30,965 --> 03:19:33,755
“Welcome, nephew,” she said.

3532
03:19:33,755 --> 03:19:37,555
“What a tall fellow you are, to be sure.

3533
03:19:37,555 --> 03:19:40,066
Stand off, sir, and let me look at you.”

3534
03:19:40,066 --> 03:19:43,049
The Virginian obeyed,
blushing from his black

3535
03:19:43,049 --> 03:19:44,845
hair to his collar.

3536
03:19:44,845 --> 03:19:49,330
Then his new relative turned to her
niece, and gave her a flower.

3537
03:19:49,330 --> 03:19:52,850
“Put this in his coat, my dear,” she said.

3538
03:19:52,850 --> 03:19:56,085
“And I think I understand why you
wanted to marry him.”

3539
03:19:56,085 --> 03:20:00,474
After this the maid came and showed
them to their rooms.

3540
03:20:00,474 --> 03:20:05,469
Left alone in her garden,
the great-aunt sank on a bench and sat

3541
03:20:05,469 --> 03:20:10,728
there for some time;
for emotion had made her very weak.

3542
03:20:10,728 --> 03:20:15,902
Upstairs, Molly, sitting on the
Virginian’s knee, put the flower in his

3543
03:20:15,902 --> 03:20:18,942
coat, and then laid her
head upon his shoulder.

3544
03:20:18,942 --> 03:20:22,582
“I didn’t know old ladies could be
that way,” he said.

3545
03:20:22,582 --> 03:20:23,982
“D’ yu’ reckon there are many?”

3546
03:20:23,982 --> 03:20:26,062
“Oh, I don’t know,” said the girl.

3547
03:20:26,062 --> 03:20:27,302
“I’m so happy!”

3548
03:20:27,302 --> 03:20:30,903
Now at tea, and during the evening,
the great-aunt carried out

3549
03:20:30,903 --> 03:20:32,572
her plans still further.

3550
03:20:32,572 --> 03:20:40,512
At first she did the chief part
of the talking herself.

3551
03:20:41,433 --> 03:20:45,602
Nor did she ask questions
about Wyoming too soon.

3552
03:20:45,602 --> 03:20:49,633
She reached that in her own way,
and found out the one thing that

3553
03:20:49,633 --> 03:20:50,934
she desired to know.

3554
03:20:50,934 --> 03:20:53,488
It was through General Stark that she
led up to it.

3555
03:20:53,488 --> 03:20:56,855
“There he is,” she said,
showing the family portrait.

3556
03:20:56,855 --> 03:21:01,334
“And a rough time he must have had of
it now and then.

3557
03:21:01,334 --> 03:21:05,479
New Hampshire was full of fine young
men in those days.

3558
03:21:05,479 --> 03:21:11,487
But nowadays most of them have gone away
to seek their fortunes in the West.

3559
03:21:11,487 --> 03:21:13,358
Do they find them, I wonder?”

3560
03:21:13,358 --> 03:21:14,478
“Yes, ma’am.

3561
03:21:14,478 --> 03:21:15,973
All the good ones do.”

3562
03:21:15,973 --> -1:59:59,000
“But you cannot all be⁠—what is
the name?⁠—Cattle Kings.

3563
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3564
03:21:19,530 --> 03:21:21,912
“That’s having its day, ma’am, right now.

3565
03:21:21,912 --> 03:21:24,940
And we are getting ready for the change⁠—
some of us are.”

3566
03:21:24,940 --> 03:21:29,042
“And what may be the change,
and when is it to come?”

3567
03:21:29,042 --> 03:21:32,918
“When the natural pasture is
eaten off,” he explained.

3568
03:21:32,918 --> 03:21:35,474
“I have seen that coming a long while.

3569
03:21:35,474 --> 03:21:39,874
And if the thieves are going to make us
drive our stock away, we’ll drive it.

3570
03:21:39,874 --> 03:21:45,009
If they don’t, we’ll have big pastures
fenced, and hay and shelter

3571
03:21:45,009 --> 03:21:46,409
ready for winter.

3572
03:21:46,409 --> 03:21:50,652
What we’ll spend in improvements,
we’ll more than save in wages.

3573
03:21:50,652 --> 03:21:53,401
I am well fixed for the new conditions.

3574
03:21:53,401 --> 03:21:57,652
And then, when I took up my land,
I chose a place where there is coal.

3575
03:21:57,652 --> -1:59:59,000
It will not be long before the
new railroad needs that.

3576
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3577
03:22:00,564 --> 03:22:05,916
Thus the old lady learned more of her
niece’s husband in one evening than the

3578
03:22:05,916 --> 03:22:11,278
Bennington family had ascertained during
his whole sojourn with them.

3579
03:22:11,278 --> 03:22:16,418
For by touching upon Wyoming and its
future, she roused him to talk.

3580
03:22:16,418 --> 03:22:19,869
He found her mind alive to Western
questions: irrigation,

3581
03:22:19,869 --> 03:22:26,321
the Indians, the forests;
and so he expanded, revealing to her his

3582
03:22:26,321 --> 03:22:29,353
wide observation and
his shrewd intelligence.

3583
03:22:29,353 --> 03:22:31,654
He forgot entirely to be shy.

3584
03:22:31,654 --> 03:22:35,493
She sent Molly to bed,
and kept him talking for an hour.

3585
03:22:35,493 --> 03:22:39,741
Then she showed him old things that she
was proud of, “because,”

3586
03:22:39,741 --> 03:22:45,345
she said, “we, too, had something to do
with making our country.

3587
03:22:45,345 --> 03:22:49,089
And now go to Molly, or you’ll both think
me a tiresome old lady.”

3588
03:22:49,089 --> 03:22:53,777
“I think⁠—” he began,
but was not quite equal to expressing

3589
03:22:53,777 --> 03:22:57,540
what he thought, and suddenly his
shyness flooded him again.

3590
03:22:57,540 --> 03:23:01,611
“In that case, nephew,”
said she, “I’m afraid you’ll have to

3591
03:23:01,611 --> 03:23:02,851
kiss me good night.”

3592
03:23:02,851 --> 03:23:06,931
And so she dismissed him to his wife,
and to happiness greater than either of

3593
03:23:06,931 --> 03:23:11,179
them had known since they had left the
mountains and come to the East.

3594
03:23:11,179 --> 03:23:14,201
“He’ll do,” she said to herself, nodding.

3595
03:23:14,201 --> 03:23:18,778
Their visit to Dunbarton was all
happiness and reparation for the

3596
03:23:18,778 --> 03:23:21,485
doleful days at Bennington.

3597
03:23:21,485 --> 03:23:25,730
The old lady gave much comfort and advice
to her niece in private,

3598
03:23:25,730 --> 03:23:29,701
and when they came to leave,
she stood at the front door holding both

3599
03:23:29,701 --> 03:23:31,075
their hands a moment.

3600
03:23:31,075 --> 03:23:34,096
“God bless you, my dears,” she told them.

3601
03:23:34,096 --> -1:59:59,000
“And when you come next time,
I’ll have the nursery ready.

3602
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3603
03:23:37,273 --> 03:23:41,896
And so it happened that before she left
this world, the great-aunt was able to

3604
03:23:41,896 --> 03:23:45,555
hold in her arms the first
of their many children.

3605
03:23:45,555 --> -1:59:59,000
Judge Henry at Sunk Creek had
his wedding present ready

3606
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

3607
03:23:47,707 --> 03:23:52,750
His growing affairs in Wyoming needed his
presence in many places distant from his

3608
03:23:52,750 --> 03:23:55,659
ranch, and he made the
Virginian his partner.

3609
03:23:55,659 --> 03:24:00,311
When the thieves prevailed at length,
as they did, forcing cattle owners to

3610
03:24:00,311 --> 03:24:04,146
leave the country or be ruined,
the Virginian had forestalled this

3611
03:24:04,146 --> 03:24:05,462
crash.

3612
03:24:05,462 --> 03:24:08,327
The herds were driven away to Montana.

3613
03:24:08,327 --> 03:24:15,312
Then, in 1889, came the cattle war,
when, after putting their men in office,

3614
03:24:15,312 --> 03:24:19,422
and coming to own some of the
newspapers, the thieves brought ruin

3615
03:24:19,422 --> 03:24:21,612
on themselves as well.

3616
03:24:21,612 --> 03:24:25,158
For in a broken country there is
nothing left to steal.

3617
03:24:25,158 --> 03:24:28,165
But the railroad came,
and built a branch to that land of the

3618
03:24:28,165 --> 03:24:30,865
Virginian’s where the coal was.

3619
03:24:30,865 --> 03:24:35,197
By that time he was an important man,
with a strong grip on many various

3620
03:24:35,197 --> 03:24:42,501
enterprises, and able to give his wife
all and more than she asked or desired.

3621
03:24:42,501 --> 03:24:47,762
Sometimes she missed the Bear Creek days,
when she and he had ridden together,

3622
03:24:47,762 --> 03:24:50,863
and sometimes she declared that his
work would kill him.

3623
03:24:50,863 --> 03:24:53,659
But it does not seem to have done so.

3624
03:24:53,659 --> 03:24:58,320
Their eldest boy rides the horse Monte;
and, strictly between ourselves,

3625
03:24:58,320 --> 03:24:59,131
I think his father is going to
live a long while.

3626
03:24:59,131 --> 03:24:59,131
-THE END-
