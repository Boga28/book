CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,320
My Big Teenage Problem

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,160
I hated my freckles when I was young. Every 
day I looked in the mirror and thought,  

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:24,800
'Look at them! They're getting bigger! When I'm 
older they'll be one BIG freckle, all over me!'

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,200
At school, the other little children in 
my class laughed at me and my freckles.  

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,880
'Hello, Freckle-face!' they shouted.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,320
But when I was a teenager, it all got worse. 
My freckles were my Big Teenage Problem.

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,840
Why did I think that? Because one 
lunchtime, I went to the school library  

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,000
and started to look for a book. Suddenly, 
I heard a conversation between two boys.

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,640
'So who do you think is pretty?' one said.

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,240
'Donna Marshall?' said the other boy.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,600
My ears went - DING! - Because 
Donna's my best friend.

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,320
'Yes!' said the first boy.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,040
'Susie Carpenter?'

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,160
My ears went - DING! - Again, because that's me.

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,720
'Great legs...' began the first boy.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,640
I thought, 'That's a good start,  

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,840
but don't talk about the freckles! 
Please don't talk about the freckles.'

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,240
'... but I don't like the freckles.'

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,120
'Oh, no!' I thought. I wanted to run away and cry.  

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,120
'Perhaps that will wash my 
freckles away,' I thought.

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:04,800
Donna is pretty, of course. She has it all: pretty 
hair, blue eyes, nice teeth - and no freckles!  

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,880
Boys fall down at her feet 
when she walks past them.  

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,280
She can go out with any boy - and 
she goes out with a lot of them!  

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,240
When she gets bored with somebody, she says 
goodbye to him. Then she turns to the next boy.

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,000
That was Donna's life. A lot of young men, 
and they happily did everything for her.  

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,400
I only had freckles! I was 
very unhappy in those days.

28
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:49,840
But not now. Now I'm quite happy with my 
freckles. So what changed things? I'll tell you...

29
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,120
It was lunchtime in the Dining 
Room, and I was with Donna.  

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,640
Suddenly, Donna said, 'A boy 
over there is looking at us.'

31
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,240
'Looking at you, you mean,' I said. 'What boy?'

32
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
'I don't know,' she said. 'I 
never saw him before now.'

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,560
I started to turn my head.

34
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,320
'Don't look!' Donna said quickly. 'He'll 
see you! Look at him when he's not looking.'

35
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,440
'Donna, I have to look at him,' I said. 
'Or how will I know when he's not looking?  

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,960
What's wrong? Will he run away when he sees me?'

37
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,040
'OK, look at him,' said Donna. 'But be 
careful. We don't want him to think,  

38
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,920
"So they're interested in me!" 
Go and get a glass of water.'

39
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,520
'I've got some water,' I said.

40
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,080
'Go and get another glass!' she said.  

41
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,600
'You can look at him on the way. 
He's sitting alone, near the door.'

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:13,840
I went for some more water and looked at the boy. 
He smiled at me. I smiled back and he blushed.

43
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,600
When I got back to the table, Donna 
nearly pulled me down into my chair.  

44
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,560
'Do you know him?' she asked. 'His 
name's Jack,' I said. 'He came to  

45
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,120
the school at the beginning of term. 
We're in the same class for History.'

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,880
'He's got a nice face!' said 
Donna. Her eyes were excited.

47
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:49,120
Did he? Did Jack have a nice face? I thought 
about it. I said, 'But he's not handsome. Is he?'

48
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:58,240
'No,' said Donna. 'But he isn't handsome in 
a really nice way. Do you know him well?'

49
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,160
'Not very well,' I said. 'I say hello to him.'

50
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,280
'Who's he going out with?' asked Donna.

51
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,080
'Nobody!' I said. 'He only came 
here at the beginning of term!'

52
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:21,280
Donna's brain started to work - fast. 'You've 
got History last lesson today,' she said.  

53
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,560
'Talk to him after the lesson. 
Give me time, and I'll find you.'

54
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,320
I said, 'Wait a minute! Excuse me?  

55
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,840
Aren't you Donna Marshall? Aren't 
you going out with Steve Bridges?'

56
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,360
'Not really,' said Donna.

57
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,440
I said, 'Last week you said, 
"Steve's wonderful, Susie!'"

58
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,800
'That was last week,' said Donna. 
'I like Steve, of course, but...'

59
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,120
I knew two things: Donna was bored with Steve  

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:12,560
('Goodbye, Steve!'). And Jack was next, 
because... well... Donna always got her man.

61
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,960
So after the history lesson, I put my 
books in my bag slowly. And when Jack  

62
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,120
went past my table on his way out, 
I went after him. I said, 'Jack?'

63
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,680
He turned and saw me. He blushed again.

64
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,240
I thought, 'He's very shy.' 
I said, 'Hi, I'm Susie!'

65
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,200
'I know you are,' said Jack. 
'Did you want something?'

66
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,920
'Do you like it here?' I asked, because I 
couldn't think of anything more interesting.  

67
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,600
'Is it difficult at a big school 
when you don't know anybody?'

68
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,920
'It's OK,' he said. 'Everybody's 
friendly. And it smells right.'

69
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
'What?' I said.

70
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,240
Jack smiled - a nice smile! He said, 
'My last school was near a farm.  

71
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,560
The smell was bad! We had to shut 
the windows, summer and winter.'

72
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
'So you're a country boy?' I said.

73
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,400
'No,' he said. 'My school was in Basingstoke.'

74
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,240
'Oh, Basingstoke!' I said.

75
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,280
'You know it?' he said.

76
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,000
'No,' I said. 'Is it a nice place?'

77
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:49,280
'It's OK.' He looked at me strangely, 
but I couldn't stop now. Where was Donna?

78
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,920
I said, 'Are there any cinemas in Basingstoke?'

79
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,840
'Er, yes,' he said.

80
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,120
'Did you see the film -?' I began.

81
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,600
Then I saw Donna. She came to us 
and smiled. She said, 'Hi, Susie!'

82
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,360
I said, 'Hi! Donna, this is 
Jack. Jack, this is Donna.'

83
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,080
Donna gave him a big smile. Her smile 
usually makes men weak in the legs.

84
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,080
Jack put out his hand and said, 
'Hello, Donna. Nice to meet you.'

85
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,240
Usually makes men weak in 
the legs. But not this time!

86
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:38,000
After a minute, Donna tried again. She 
gave another smile and put her hand in  

87
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,360
Jack's hand. I thought, 'Why 
isn't he falling at her feet?'

88
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,920
I left them. She could do the work now.

89
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,360
Donna phoned me at six o'clock. She wasn't 
happy. She said, 'That Jack - really!'

90
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,880
'What's wrong with him?' I asked.

91
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,520
'I could only get about six 
words out of him!' she said.

92
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,280
'He was all right when he talked to 
me,' I said. 'Perhaps he was shy.'

93
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,560
'He's slow,' she said. 'I want to go 
out with him but he didn't ask me.'

94
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,560
I thought, 'Donna was alone with 
a boy for more than five minutes,  

95
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,360
and he didn't ask her out! What's wrong with her!'

96
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,840
I said, 'I think he's shy. He blushes easily.'

97
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,200
'I'll try something different 
next time,' said Donna.  

98
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
'What does he like to do? What doesn't he like?'

99
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,440
'I don't think he likes farms,' I said.

100
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,800
'Farms?' said Donna. 'Who 
wants to talk about farms?  

101
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,520
Does he like dancing? Does he like 
the cinema? You'll have to ask him.'

102
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,080
'Why don't you ask him?' I said.

103
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:12,400
Donna did this big sigh down the phone. She said, 
'Oh, Susie! You don't know anything about boys.'

104
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,720
She was right, I didn't. And it 
was because of the freckles.
 
 
 

105
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,520
CHAPTER TWO

106
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,840
Cats and Poems

107
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,040
Next day, when we had lunch in the 
'Dining Room'. Donna watched Jack all  

108
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:40,000
the time. When he was ready to leave, Donna 
said, 'Now, Susie! Go after him, quickly!'

109
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,760
'But I'm having my lunch, ' I said.

110
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,000
'Forget lunch!' she said. 'Food makes you fat.'

111
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,400
I said, 'OK, OK! I'm going!'

112
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,320
Can you think of a better friend than me? Do 
your friends go without their lunch for you?

113
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,480
I found Jack near the tennis 
courts. I said, 'Jack! Hi!'

114
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,440
'Hi, Susie,' said Jack, and he blushed again.

115
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,320
I said, 'So what do you like, Jack?'

116
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,760
'Pardon?' he said.

117
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,160
'Do you like sports? Tennis?' I said.

118
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,880
Jack laughed - a nice laugh! He said,  

119
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,680
'No, I'm not very good at sports. 
I like reading, or computer games.'

120
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,360
'Do you like dancing?' I asked.

121
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,840
'Sometimes,' he answered. 'When 
I'm dancing with the right girl.'

122
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,400
We didn't speak for a minute. Jack looked at me. 
'His eyes aren't brown, they're green,' I thought.

123
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,840
After a time, I said, 'What 
other things do you like?'

124
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,360
'Cats,' said Jack. 'We've got 
three. They're good for stress.'

125
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,120
I didn't understand. I said, 
'Cats give you stress?'

126
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,960
A nice laugh again. Jack said, 'No. They stop it.'  

127
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,480
He smiled at me for a minute. 
'And what does Susie like?'

128
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,640
I wasn't ready for this. I had 
to ask Jack questions. I said,  

129
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,120
'Oh, you know. Reading, music. I write poems -'

130
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,840
'You write poems?'

131
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,840
'Yes,' I said. 'When I was 
young, my school teacher told me,  

132
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,720
"That's a good poem, Susie!". After 
that, I never stopped writing them.'

133
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,720
Jack's eyes were open wide. He said, 
'That's strange! I write poems too!'

134
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,760
'A lot of people do, Jack,' I said. 'The 
library's got a lot of books of poems in it.'

135
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,720
Nice laugh Number Three. Jack said, 
'You'll have to show me yours one day.'

136
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,680
Conversation with Jack was 
easy, so I talked. And talked.  

137
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,800
Then I saw the time and 
said, 'Sorry, are you bored?'

138
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
'No, I'm not bored,' he said. 'I enjoyed 
listening.' His face went red again.  

139
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,680
He looked at the floor and said, 
'Can we do it again someday?'

140
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,920
I said, 'Yes, of course! I'll see you.'

141
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,840
'See you,' he said.

142
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,920
I was nearly late for my class. Donna 
wasn't happy. She said, 'Where were you?'

143
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,560
'With Jack,' I said.

144
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,320
'All this time?'

145
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,120
'It was a long conversation,' 
I said. 'He's interesting.'

146
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,240
But Donna didn't want to know that. She 
said, 'Tell me about him. What does he like?'

147
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,120
'He doesn't like sports,' I said. 
'He likes cats, he writes poems -'

148
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,480
'Poems?' said Donna.

149
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,720
'Yes,' I said. 'You know - 
poems - a lot of words...'

150
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,240
'OK, OK! I know about poems!' said Donna.

151
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,840
'And he likes dancing,' I told her.

152
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:40,320
Donna smiled. It wasn't a pretty smile. Cats and 
poems weren't very useful to her, but dancing...

153
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,440
'Does he?' she said. 'Now that's interesting!'

154
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,480
Next day, Donna wanted to look for Jack.  

155
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,600
She took me with her. We found 
him outside the English classroom.

156
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,800
Donna said, 'Hello, Jack!'

157
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,800
Jack said, 'Hello... er...?'

158
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,280
'Donna,' said Donna.

159
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,680
'Sorry!' he said. 'I can never remember names!'

160
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,040
Strange - Jack didn't blush 
when Donna talked to him.

161
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,520
Donna said, 'Susie tells me you like dancing.'

162
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,160
'Er... well..." said Jack.

163
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,480
'There's a disco at school on Friday 
night,' said Donna. 'Are you going to it?'

164
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,280
'Er -'

165
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,640
'I'll be there,' said Donna.

166
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,680
'Will you?' said Jack.

167
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
'I love dancing,' said Donna.

168
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
'Oh?' said Jack.

169
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,440
This wasn't easy for Donna. 'Perhaps I'll 
dance with you. Ask me nicely,' she said.

170
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,320
'That's very kind of you,' said Jack. 'But I think 
my parents are planning something for Friday.'

171
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,440
Was Donna angry on the walk home?  

172
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:14,400
She was! She said, 'Is it Jack, 
or is it me? Am I suddenly ugly?'

173
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,280
'No,' I answered. 'Donna, he's shy.'

174
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,160
'He's not shy with you!' she said.

175
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:29,200
'I'm not the beautiful, famous Donna!' 
I said. 'Listen, give him some time.'

176
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,760
'I can't,' she said.

177
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,080
'Why not?' I asked.

178
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,960
'I finished with Steve last night. Who 
am I going to go to the disco with?  

179
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,680
I can't stay at home when my friends are 
having a good time. You have to help me.'

180
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,880
'I do?' I said.

181
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,600
'Yes, you do,' she said.  

182
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:03,840
'Tomorrow, Jack will have to ask me to the disco. 
Say that to him. And you think I'll say yes.'

183
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,200
I said, 'Why don't you ask him? It's easier.'

184
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:18,240
'No!' cried Donna. 'That's no 
good. Perhaps he'll say no!'

185
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
'So what's the problem?' I asked.

186
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,880
'Well, then I'll be unhappy and 'he'll 
think, "Oh, she likes me!'" she said.

187
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,240
'But you do like him!' I said.

188
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,240
'Yes, but I don't want him to know 
that,' she said. 'Please, Susie!'

189
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,000
'All right,' I said.

190
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,200
You can't say no to Donna. When you say 
no, she's angry and unhappy for days!  

191
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,040
It's easier to say yes, OK.

192
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:03,040
I said, 'You don't usually try as hard as 
this, Donna. Why this time? Why with Jack?'

193
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:13,840
Donna sighed and said, 'I like to win.'
 
 
 

194
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,840
CHAPTER THREE

195
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,600
The Phone Call

196
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
When I got home, I went up to my room.  

197
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:33,280
I started my homework. After five minutes, I heard 
the phone. I thought, 'Donna! What is it now?  

198
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,640
Doesn't she like Jack now? Are 
the colour of his eyes wrong?'

199
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,760
But when I answered the phone, it wasn't Donna.

200
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,320
Somebody said, 'Can I talk to Susie, please?'

201
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,520
'You're talking to her,' I said.

202
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,840
'Oh, hi, Susie! It's Jack.'

203
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,600
Really? What did Jack want?

204
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,160
Jack said, 'I hope you aren't angry. I 
found your number in the phone book.'

205
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,000
'That's fine,' I said. 'Do you want 
to talk to me about something?'

206
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,480
Then I thought, 'Of course he wants to talk 
to me! He's on the phone! Why did I say that?'

207
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,320
Jack said, 'Yes. Er, I'd like your advice.'

208
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,480
This was new. People didn't 
usually ask for my advice.

209
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,280
I said, 'OK, what is it?'

210
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,720
He didn't speak for a minute.  

211
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:52,480
Then he said, 'There's a girl at school. I 
like her very much, but I can't tell her.  

212
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:03,840
I talked to her two or three times. I think 
she likes me. But am I right? How do I know?'

213
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,440
I thought, 'Donna! It has to 
be Donna. He does like her.'

214
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,320
I said, 'Do I know this person?'

215
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,480
'Er, yes,' said Jack.

216
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,760
I said, 'What's the problem? Tell her.'

217
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,320
'I tried,' he said. 'I can't say the words.  

218
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,360
I wrote some poems about her, 
but I didn't give them to her.'

219
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,960
'Give Donna a poem and she'll put it on her 
bedroom wall. Then she'll laugh at it,' I thought.

220
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:57,280
I said, 'Jack, don't be shy. The girl likes you 
very much. I know it. See her and tell her.'

221
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,840
'Can't I do it on the phone?' he said.

222
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,400
'No!' I said. 'You have to see her 
and tell her. Don't be afraid.'

223
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,200
'OK,' he said.

224
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,320
Jack wasn't happy about the idea. I 
could hear that, so I tried to help.  

225
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,840
I said, 'That disco - can't you go?'

226
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:32,640
Jack sighed. 'Yes, I can. I said 
all that about my parents because -'

227
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,280
I said, 'Ask her to go with you. Tomorrow. 
She'll say yes. I know she will.'

228
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,200
'Susie, I -'

229
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:51,280
'Sorry I have to go now,' I said. 'I'm really 
busy. See you tomorrow, and don't be afraid. OK?'

230
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,840
'OK,' he said. 'Thank you for your help. Goodbye!'

231
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,320
'Goodbye!' I said.

232
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,440
I put the phone down quickly, 
before I started to cry.  

233
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:16,400
'Oh, Jack!' I thought. 'Why Donna? Why is it 
always Donna? Why does she always get the boys?'

234
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,840
I didn't phone Donna then. I didn't tell her about 
Jack and the disco. I didn't want to talk to her.

235
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,680
Suddenly, I understood something.

236
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,000
When I went out with Donna, boys didn't see me.  

237
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:43,600
They looked at Donna and they talked to Donna. 
They smiled at Donna. And me? They didn't see me.

238
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:52,880
And Donna always wanted me to do things for her. 
Get this, Susie. Get that. Tell somebody this,  

239
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:00,880
Susie. Tell somebody that. Say sorry 
to him for me, Susie. And I did it!  

240
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,240
I did it because Donna was beautiful, and I...

241
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,320
...And I had freckles. It wasn't Donna,  

242
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,360
it was the freckles. Nobody looked past 
my freckles and saw the person under them.

243
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,160
I went back to my room and did my homework.  

244
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,480
You don't have to think about anything 
when you're doing homework.
 
 
 

245
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,000
CHAPTER FOUR

246
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,840
Freckles are Great!

247
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,840
Next morning I didn't tell 
Donna about Jack's phone call.  

248
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,960
I was quiet all morning, and I 
tried to stay away from everybody.  

249
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,200
I had History, but I left quickly after 
the lesson. I didn't want to talk to Jack.

250
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,440
At lunchtime, I went for a 
walk. I was unhappy. Why?  

251
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,440
I didn't really know. I bought some fruit 
from a shop. Then I sat down and ate it.

252
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,280
When I finished it, I looked at my watch. 
I had to go back. 'Donna will be happy now,  

253
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,080
because she's going to the disco with 
Jack,' I thought. 'She'll tell me  

254
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:31,840
every little thing about it. She'll be so 
happy, and she won't see my unhappy face.'

255
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,560
I walked back to school slowly.

256
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:44,080
And I saw Jack! He ran across the road and stopped 
in front of me. His face was red, and he was hot.

257
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,520
He said, 'Susie! I couldn't find you! I looked -'

258
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,080
'Well, I'm here now,' I said. 
'Was everything all right?'

259
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,720
'What?' he said.

260
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,640
'With Donna,' I said.

261
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,560
Jack looked at me strangely. 'Donna?' he said.

262
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,680
'You asked her to the disco,' I 
said. 'And she said yes. Right?'

263
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Jack opened and closed his 
mouth. Then he started laughing.

264
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,040
I said, 'What's funny?'

265
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:31,560
'You thought - I mean, when I spoke to 
you on the phone yesterday, you - and I -'  

266
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:42,640
Jack stopped, then started again. He said, 
'Susie, can I take you to the disco, please?'

267
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:50,400
'Are my ears playing games with me?' 
I thought. 'Did I hear him right?'

268
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
'Pardon?' I said.

269
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,160
Jack spoke slowly. 'Will you 
come to the disco with me?'

270
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,280
'But... Donna wants to go with you!' I said.

271
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,400
'And I want to go with you,' he said.

272
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,960
'W-wait!' I said. 'Is this right?  

273
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,840
Donna wants to go to the disco with 
you, but you want to go with me?'

274
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,160
'Yes,' he said.

275
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,560
'Why?' I said.

276
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:37,840
And Jack said, 'Because I like you 
very much. You're pretty... and funny.  

277
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:47,200
And you don't think I'm strange. You write 
poems too. And - and I love your freckles!'

278
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,920
'You do?' I said.

279
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,000
'Yes,' he said. 'They're lovely!'

280
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,000
'And you really want to go out with me?' I said.

281
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,040
'I really do,' he said.

282
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,480
'Can I think about it?' I asked.

283
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,880
'Of course! How much time do you want?' he said.

284
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,200
'Half a minute. Yes!' I said.

285
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,640
He laughed, and I laughed with him.

286
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,520
Did I walk to the classroom? 
Were my feet on the ground?  

287
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,560
Perhaps they were. Or did I fly? I don't know.

288
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,840
I thought, 'He likes me! He likes me! 
I'm wonderful, I'm beautiful, I'm great!'

289
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,840
And then I saw Donna.

290
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:47,840
I thought, 'Oh, no! What am I 
going to tell her? How? When?'

291
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,280
In the end, it was easy. When we 
'walked home after school, Donna said,  

292
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,840
'It's strange. Jack didn't 
ask me out. Did you tell him?'

293
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:09,520
She was angry with me. She didn't say, 
'It was your job, and you didn't do it'.  

294
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,840
But she thought it.

295
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,080
And now I was angry. I said, 
'No, Donna, I didn't tell him.'

296
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:29,840
Donna made an ugly face. 'Right!' she said. I'll 
never do anything for you! So don't ask me!'

297
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,040
'I didn't ask him because he's 
taking a girl to the disco,' I said.

298
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,520
'Who?' she asked.

299
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,520
'Me,' I said.

300
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,400
Donna stopped. She looked at 
me, and her mouth fell open.

301
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,760
'Pardon?'

302
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,560
And I enjoyed telling her. 'Yes,' I said. 
'He liked me, but he didn't tell me.  

303
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,840
He was too shy.' I smiled. 'He likes freckles.'

304
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,800
Donna said, 'But-but-but-!' Then 
she stopped and started again.  

305
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,600
'There was something strange about 
that boy. I knew it!' she said.

306
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,600
'Why?' I said. 'Because he wants to 
take me to the disco, and not you?'

307
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,760
'Oh, that's not important to me!' she said.  

308
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,840
'I didn't really want to go with him. It was 
only a game. I like playing games with boys.'

309
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
'Wrong!' I shouted. 'You wanted Jack!'

310
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,160
'No, I didn't!' she shouted.

311
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,000
'Yes, you did!'

312
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,960
Donna made an ugly face again. 'Well, go out with 
Jack!' she said. 'I hope you have a nice time.'

313
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,840
She said, 'nice time'. But she 
meant, 'I hope you break your legs'.

314
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,680
I said, 'Tell me, Donna. You're jealous! Right?'

315
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,920
'No, I'm not jealous!' she said. 
But she turned and walked away.

316
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:10,640
'Donna wants me to feel bad,' I thought. 'But I 
won't! Donna's not going to do that to me now.  

317
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,680
She knows something important, and I know it too.  

318
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:25,440
A beautiful face isn't everything! And I can't 
feel sorry for her because - because it's funny!'

319
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,040
I started laughing. And I laughed and laughed.

320
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,440
I did go to the disco with Jack, 
and we had a wonderful time.  

321
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,080
Now we're great friends. And he 
doesn't blush when he looks at me!

322
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:53,520
And Donna? Donna doesn't speak to me. When I try 
to talk to her, she walks away. But she'll talk to  

323
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:00,000
me again one day, because we are good friends, 
really. But things will be different then.

324
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:17,840
Oh, yes... and freckles are great!
 
 
 
 

325
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,417
- THE END -
