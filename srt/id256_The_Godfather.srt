CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,360
Wedding on Long Island

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,120
On the last Saturday in August, 1945,  

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:27,640
Miss Constanzia Corleone, daughter of 
Don Vito Corleone, married Carlo Rizzi.

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,400
Her father had invited hundreds 
of people to the wedding at his  

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,120
huge house on Long Island, just outside New York.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:44,640
As the guests arrived, Don Corleone welcomed them 
all, rich and poor, with an equal show of love.

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,120
Many of the guests had reason to be grateful 
to Don Corleone for their good luck in life,  

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,880
and they called him 'Godfather' to his face.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,200
Standing next to him as he welcomed 
the guests were two of his three sons,  

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,480
Santino - or Sonny, as he 
was called - was the eldest.

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,360
He was a tall, strong, good-looking 
man with thick brown hair.

13
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,560
He looked uncomfortable in his 
white shirt and black suit.

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,280
The second son, Fredo, was completely different.

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,640
He was weak-looking and pale, 
with sad dark eyes and thin lips.

16
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,160
The youngest son,  

17
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:37,400
Michael, was sitting at a table in the corner 
of the garden with his girlfriend, Kay.

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:44,840
There was a gentle, innocent quality to 
him, with his soft dark eyes and full lips,  

19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,320
but his army uniform suggested 
that this was not a weak man.

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,240
Just a quiet one.

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,760
He was embarrassed by all the singing and dancing,  

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,400
but he was quietly pleased 
that Kay was enjoying herself.

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,840
This was the first time 
that she had met his family.

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,600
'Who's that funny little fat man over there?' 
she asked, her eyes shining with excitement.

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,160
'He looks about sixty years old 
but he's dancing like a teenager.'

26
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,960
'That's Pete Clemenza,' Michael said.

27
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,880
'He's an old friend of my father's.'

28
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,360
'And what about him?' Kay looked at a large,  

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,640
ugly man who was sitting alone 
outside the house, talking to himself.

30
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,520
'He's very frightening.'

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,120
'That's Luca Brasi,' Michael smiled at Kay.

32
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,800
'He's waiting to speak to my father in private.'

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,720
'Yes, but who is he?'

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,280
'He helps my father sometimes,' Michael 
replied quietly, looking at his food.

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,840
Suddenly, the big man stood up 
and Kay looked away quickly,  

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,040
afraid that he was coming over to talk to her.

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,440
But another man came up to the table instead.

38
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,280
He had thin fair hair and blue eyes.

39
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,000
Michael stood up and the two 
men hugged each other warmly.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,120
'My brother, Tom Hagen, this is 
Kay Adams,' Michael finally said.

41
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,080
Tom Hagen shook Kay's hand, 
then whispered to Michael:

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
'My father wants to know why 
you don't go to see him.'

43
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:38,400
Michael sat down without speaking, and Tom walked 
away into the house, followed by Luca Brasi.

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,280
'If he's your brother,  

45
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,240
why does he have a different name?' 
Kay asked Michael when Tom had gone.

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:53,520
'When my brother Sonny was a boy,' Michael 
explained, 'he found Tom Hagen in the street.

47
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,840
Tom had no home, so my father took him 
in and he's been with us ever since.

48
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,520
He's a good lawyer.

49
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,920
Not a Sicilian, but I think 
he's going to be a Consigliori!

50
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,760
'What's that?'

51
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,240
'My father's chief adviser.

52
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,400
Very important to the family.' 
Suddenly, there came a loud,  

53
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,360
happy sound from the other side of the garden.

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,040
The music and singing stopped.

55
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,800
Connie, in her white wedding dress, left her 
husband and ran towards the gate screaming:

56
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,880
'Johnny!

57
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,128
Johnny!' She threw herself into 
the arms of a very handsome dark-  

58
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:40,280
haired man in a white suit, and 
covered his face with kisses.

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,920
Then she led him by the hand 
through a crowd of excited,  

60
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,480
screaming girls, to meet her new husband, Carlo.

61
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,400
Kay turned to Michael excitedly.

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,640
'You didn't tell me your family 
knew Johnny Fontane,' she said.

63
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
'Sure.

64
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,080
Do you want to meet him?' Michael smiled.

65
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,960
'My father helped him to become famous.'

66
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,760
'He did? How?'

67
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,920
At that moment, Johnny Fontane began to sing.

68
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,400
'Let's listen to the song,' Michael 
tried to change the subject.

69
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:22,080
'Please Michael,' Kay said impatiently, reaching 
across the table and squeezing his hand.

70
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,200
'Tell me.'

71
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,480
'Well, Johnny is my father's godson.

72
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:35,480
When Johnny was beginning to become popular, 
he had a problem with his boss, a band-leader.

73
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,160
Johnny wanted to leave the band, 
but this man wouldn't let him.

74
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,320
So Johnny asked my father to help.

75
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:49,520
My father went to see the band-leader 
and offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go.

76
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,400
He said no.

77
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,120
The next day my father went 
to see him with Luca Brasi.

78
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,240
One hour later, the band-leader let Johnny go.

79
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,200
For $1,000.' Kay looked confused.

80
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,840
'How did he do that?'

81
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,280
'My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

82
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,920
Luca held a gun to his head and my father told him  

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,960
that if he didn't agree to let Johnny 
go, Luca would blow his brains out.'

84
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,480
At first Kay didn't say anything.

85
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,800
She thought Michael was joking.

86
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,000
But Michael wasn't smiling.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,840
'That's a true story, Kay,' he said quietly.

88
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,000
Then he saw Kay beginning to look 
worried, a little frightened,  

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,440
so he squeezed her hand and added quickly:

90
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,400
'That's my family, Kay.

91
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,680
That's not me.'

92
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,640
'I don't know what to do, Godfather.' 
Johnny Fontane sat on the corner of the  

93
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,960
desk in Don Corleone's dark office 
and shook his head helplessly.

94
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,760
Don Corleone was sitting in his leather chair, 
listening carefully to his favourite godson.

95
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:08,840
He had, after all, travelled two thousand miles 
from California to be at his daughter's wedding.

96
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,560
'My voice is weak, 'Johnny went on.

97
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,640
'I can't sing as well as I used to.

98
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,320
There's a part in a film that I want.

99
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,600
It would be perfect for me.

100
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,960
If I had this part, I'd be a top star again.

101
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,760
But the boss of the film company, 
Jack Woltz, won't give me the part.

102
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,720
Can you help me?'

103
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,960
'Go and rest,' Don Corleone said.

104
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,640
His voice was soft, but there was a rough 
quality to it that made everybody listen.

105
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,600
It was a voice impossible to argue with.

106
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,080
Something to do with the way he 
spoke without moving his mouth.

107
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,960
'In a month, this man will 
give you what you want.'

108
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,600
'Too late,' Johnny looked 
at his godfather unhappily.

109
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,400
'They start filming in a week.'

110
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,480
Don Corleone stood up and put a 
fatherly arm around Johnny's shoulder.

111
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:18,640
'I'm going to make this man an offer he can't 
refuse,' he said, leading Johnny towards the door.

112
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,920
'Now, go and enjoy yourself 
He kissed Johnny on the cheek,  

113
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,600
shut the door and turned to Tom 
Hagen, who had heard everything.

114
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,160
'What are we going to do with your 
daughter's new husband?' Tom asked.

115
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,040
'Shall we give him anything important to do?'

116
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,360
'No,' Don Corleone replied.

117
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,640
'Give him something small.

118
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,000
A betting shop, maybe.

119
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,040
But never discuss the family business with him.'

120
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,800
'Virgil Sollozzo called, 'Tom went on.

121
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,400
'He wants to meet you next week.'

122
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,480
'We'll discuss that after you 
get back from California.'

123
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,720
Tom looked surprised.

124
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,320
'Why am I going to California?'

125
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,880
'I want you to help Johnny.

126
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,760
You're going to talk to this Jack Woltz.

127
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,080
I want you to go tonight.

128
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,320
And now, if there's no other business, 
I'd like to go to my daughter's wedding.'

129
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,520
With these words, Don Corleone left 
Tom alone in the office, went outside,  

130
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:38,280
took his daughter by the hand and danced with 
her to the slow, Sicilian music.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

131
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,680
CHAPTER TWO

132
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,000
The Greatest Racehorse in the World

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,760
Tom Hagen arrived in Hollywood 
early the next morning.

134
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:53,280
From the airport he went straight to his 
hotel, showered, shaved, and had breakfast.

135
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,480
Then he drove to the film company for his 
meeting with Jack Woltz at ten o'clock.

136
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,080
Jack Woltz was giving a birthday party for one  

137
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,200
of his young girl stars in 
front of a lot of reporters.

138
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,440
Tom waited patiently.

139
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,320
Finally, Woltz walked up to him.

140
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:19,800
He was a tall man with thick silver hair, 
expensive clothes and a hard, unfriendly face.

141
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,440
'OK, start talking,' he said to Tom.

142
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,080
'I'm a busy man.'

143
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,560
'I was sent by a friend of 
Johnny Fontane,' Tom said.

144
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,520
'He would be very grateful to you 
if you could do him a small favour.'

145
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,960
'I'm listening, 'Woltz 
said, busily signing papers.

146
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,520
'Give Johnny the part in that new 
war film you're going to make.'

147
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,120
Woltz stopped writing and laughed.

148
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,240
He took Tom by the arm, as if he was an 
old friend, and led him towards the door.

149
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:02,400
'And if I gave Johnny Fontane this part, what 
favour would your friend do for me?' he said.

150
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,320
'You have some problems with 
your workers,' Tom said.

151
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,920
'My friend could make these problems disappear.

152
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,920
You also have a top star who's taking drugs'.

153
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,480
But Jack Woltz had heard enough.

154
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,160
'Listen to me!' he shouted angrily.

155
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,640
'You tell your boss, whoever he is, that 
Johnny Fontane will never get that film.

156
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,240
You don't frighten me!'

157
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,560
'I'm a lawyer,' Tom said calmly.

158
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,000
'I'm not trying to frighten you.

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,600
I know all the lawyers in New York,' said 
Jack Woltz,' but I've never heard of you.

160
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,440
Who are you?'

161
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,440
I work for one special family,' Tom said.

162
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,960
'Now, you have my number.

163
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,720
I'll wait for your call.' He shook 
Woltz's hand and added, before leaving:

164
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,120
'By the way, I like your films very much.'

165
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,520
Tom was sure that, when Woltz realized 
who he worked for, he would call.

166
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,440
And he was right.

167
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,520
Late that afternoon, a car picked him up from the  

168
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,080
hotel and drove him out of the city 
to Jack Woltz's home in the country.

169
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,400
Woltz's house looked like something from a film.

170
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,920
It was a huge pink walled house 
surrounded by beautiful gardens,  

171
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,480
lakes and fields full of horses.

172
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,760
Woltz welcomed Tom like an old friend, 
gave him a drink and showed him around.

173
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,440
'Why didn't you tell me you worked 
for Corleone, Tom?' he asked.

174
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,280
'I don't like to use his name unless it's 
really necessary.' Woltz took Tom by the arm.

175
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,920
'Come with me, Tom,' he said.

176
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,040
'I want to show you something really beautiful.'

177
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,120
Woltz led Tom into a white building 
which was guarded by private detectives.

178
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,560
Inside the building there were rows of horses.

179
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:10,080
Woltz led Tom straight towards a beautiful 
horse with smooth black skin and a large,  

180
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,000
white, diamond-shaped mark between its eyes.

181
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,840
'You have an eye for beauty, don't 
you, Tom?' Woltz said proudly.

182
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,120
'This is Khartoum, the greatest 
racehorse in the world.

183
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,240
I bought him in England for $600,000.'

184
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,960
He looked lovingly into the animal's 
enormous dark eyes for a long time,  

185
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,800
talking to it softly like a 
lover, forgetting about Tom.

186
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,520
Tom coughed with embarrassment.

187
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,160
Woltz touched the horse one last 
time on the neck, then said to Tom:

188
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,480
'Let's go and have dinner.'

189
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,800
'Corleone is Johnny's godfather,' 
Tom began to explain at dinner.

190
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,440
Although there were only two people at the 
table, the food was served by three waiters.

191
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,400
'To Italians, that's very important.' 
I respect that,' Woltz said.

192
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,400
'Just tell him he can ask me anything he likes.

193
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,880
But not this.

194
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,960
This is one favour I can't give him.'

195
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:27,440
'He never asks a second favour when the first 
one is refused.' Tom gave Woltz a warning look.

196
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,280
'Understood?'

197
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,520
This made Woltz angry.

198
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,400
'No,' he said, pointing his 
finger across the table at Tom.

199
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,320
'You don't understand.

200
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,120
Johnny Fontane never gets that film.

201
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,080
The part is perfect for him.

202
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,160
It'd make him a big star.

203
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,840
But I'm not going to give it to him.

204
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:57,400
And do you know why?' He stood up and began 
to move slowly around the table towards Tom.

205
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,840
'I had a beautiful young actress.

206
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,840
She was going to be a star.

207
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,960
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her, 
singing lessons, acting lessons, dancing lessons.

208
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,960
Then Johnny Fontane came along 
and took her away from me.

209
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,400
I lost her.

210
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,640
He made me look stupid, and that's 
something I can never forgive.

211
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,560
That's why I'll make sure that 
Johnny Fontane never works in films.

212
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,880
Now, you get out of here!

213
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,120
And if your boss wants to frighten 
me, tell him I'm no band-leader!'

214
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,720
Tom waited until Woltz had finished.

215
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,280
'Thank you for the dinner,' he said quietly.

216
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,800
'Could your car take me to 
the airport now, please? Mr.

217
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,520
Corleone is a man who likes 
to hear bad news immediately.'

218
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,240
Then without another word he left the table,  

219
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,920
took his hat from one of the servants 
and walked quickly out of the room.

220
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,480
Jack Woltz was sleeping alone in his enormous bed.

221
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,440
For some reason, this morning 
he woke up earlier than usual.

222
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,600
The room was getting light.

223
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Everything was quiet.

224
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,400
But he could feel that there was something wrong.

225
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:25,240
He turned over and saw that there 
were wet red marks on his bedclothes.

226
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,760
His night-shirt felt sticky, and there 
was a horrible smell in the room.

227
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,600
He lifted the bedclothes off 
his body and looked down.

228
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,560
His nightshirt was covered in blood.

229
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,200
Without thinking, he sat up and pulled 
the bedclothes off his bed completely.

230
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,720
The shock of what he saw nearly killed him.

231
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,600
At first he couldn't breathe.

232
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,640
He felt sick.

233
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,960
Then, a moment later, he was 
filled with an animal fear.

234
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,440
He opened his mouth and screamed.

235
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,640
For there, at the bottom of his bed,  

236
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,240
was the beautiful black head of 
his favourite racehorse, Khartoum.

237
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,640
Somebody had cut it off during the night 
and put it in his bed while he was sleeping.

238
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,680
It was stuck to the bed in a thick 
cake of blood, its mouth open,  

239
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:27,280
it's huge round eyes staring at him 
like pieces of half-eaten fruit.

240
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Jack Woltz's screams woke all the servants.

241
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,040
Six hours later, Johnny Fontane 
received a phone call telling  

242
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:43,320
him that he had the part that he 
wanted in the film.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

243
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,920
CHAPTER THREE

244
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,960
Virgil Sollozzo

245
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,400
Virgil Sollozzo was excellent 
at killing people with a knife.

246
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,840
He was a strongly-built man with dark 
eyes and a wide, cruel mouth, but today  

247
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,120
he was trying to be polite and friendly.

248
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:10,840
He had an important favour to ask, which was why 
he had asked for this meeting with Don Corleone.

249
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,240
'Don Corleone,' he smiled warmly.

250
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,120
'I need money to help me start a 
new business in drugs,' he said.

251
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,120
'If you give me one million dollars, I can  

252
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,280
promise you between three and four 
million dollars in your first year.

253
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,920
After that, you'll get even more.'

254
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,840
Don Corleone said nothing at first.

255
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,920
He seemed to be thinking.

256
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,280
He looked around the room, at Sonny and Tom Hagen,  

257
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,760
and at Clemenza and Tessio, 
his two oldest friends.

258
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:55,560
They were all watching him quietly with 
serious faces, waiting to hear his reply.

259
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,720
Finally, he turned back to Sollozzo.

260
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,440
'Why do you come to me?' he 
asked in his usual rough whisper.

261
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,400
'I need a man who has important 
friends,' Sollozzo said,  

262
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,600
lowering his eyes respectfully towards the Don.

263
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,560
'And what about the Tattaglia 
family? How much will they get?'

264
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,200
Sollozzo looked surprised.

265
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,520
He didn't know that Don Corleone had 
discovered that he worked with the Tattaglias.

266
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,560
He nodded his congratulations 
in the direction of Tom Hagen,  

267
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:38,240
who had obviously done his homework, 
and turned back to Don Corleone.

268
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,080
'Don't worry,' he said.

269
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,200
'I'll pay the Tattaglias from my own money.'

270
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,160
Don Corleone didn't reply.

271
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:55,360
He stood up slowly, took a bottle from the table 
and politely offered Sollozzo some more wine.

272
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,000
Sollozzo watched with a worried look 
as the Don sat down next to him.

273
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Finally, Don Corleone spoke.

274
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,760
'I said that I would see you because 
I heard you were a serious man.

275
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,080
You are a man I should respect.

276
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,720
But I must refuse your offer.

277
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,440
I will give you my reasons.

278
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,240
It's true I have a lot of important 
friends in Government and the Law.

279
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,120
But they wouldn't be my friends if 
they knew my business was drugs.

280
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,840
Drugs is a dirty business.'

281
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,720
'But nobody will know,' Sollozzo said.

282
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:48,080
'I promise you the Tattaglias will 
make sure that nobody finds out.'

283
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Don Corleone opened his mouth to 
reply but, before he could speak,  

284
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,360
Sonny said: 'Are you saying that the 
Tattaglias can promise that they'll ...?'

285
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,600
He didn't finish his question.

286
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,480
He saw a cold look in his father's 
eye and stopped talking at once.

287
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,160
Don Corleone turned back to Sollozzo.

288
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:18,840
'I apologize for my children,' he said.' 
They talk when they should listen.

289
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,240
But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final.

290
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,960
I congratulate you on your new 
business, and I wish you luck.

291
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,600
Your business is different from mine.

292
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,880
We mustn't be enemies.

293
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,840
Thank you.'

294
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,600
Don Corleone got to his feet, 
and everybody stood up too.

295
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,360
Sollozzo was angry, but he hid 
his feelings from the others.

296
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,120
He politely shook Don Corleone's 
hand and walked out of the room.

297
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:00,720
Don Corleone waited for Tessio, Clemenza and 
Tom to leave the room, but called Sonny back.

298
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,280
He stared up into his son's eyes for a 
moment, then said in an angry whisper:  

299
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,880
'What's wrong with you? Has your brain gone soft?'

300
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,720
Sonny looked away, unable to 
look his father in the eye.

301
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,320
'I know you think this drugs 
business is a good idea.

302
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:28,520
I know you think it's the business of the 
future, and I'm just a stupid old-fashioned man.

303
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,200
But never tell anyone outside 
the family what you're thinking  

304
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,800
again.' Sonny looked surprised at 
first, and then a little angry.

305
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,320
But he was too afraid of his 
father to argue with him.

306
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,320
He lowered his head respectfully, 
turned round and left the room.

307
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:58,800
Don Corleone immediately called Tom Hagen: 
'Tell Luca Brasi to come in,' he said.

308
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,320
Brasi sat down alone in the 
office with Don Corleone.

309
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,760
He had the terrible, frightening face of a killer,  

310
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,520
an enormous body that looked 
as if it was made of rock.

311
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:19,520
But, as he looked at Don Corleone, his dark, 
unintelligent eyes were soft with respect.

312
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,840
He loved his Godfather.

313
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:28,440
And Don Corleone, knowing this, trusted 
Luca Brasi more than anyone he knew.

314
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,560
'I'm worried about Sollozzo,' Don Corleone said.

315
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:41,840
'I want you to find out what he's hiding, 
what he's got under his fingernails.

316
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,280
Do you understand? Go to the Tattaglias.

317
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:52,640
Pretend that you're not happy with our 
family and that you want to work for them.

318
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,360
Then tell me what you find out.'

319
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,440
Luca Brasi asked no questions.

320
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,520
He nodded once, lifted his 
mountainous body to its feet,  

321
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:12,680
and walked out of the room, proud to do 
whatever his Godfather asked him to do.

322
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,800
For the next few weeks, Luca 
Brasi went regularly to the  

323
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,320
night-dubs controlled by the Tattaglia family.

324
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,680
He made contact with Bruno Tattaglia, the 
youngest son and manager of the night-dubs.

325
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,800
He told Bruno he was dissatisfied 
with the Corleone family.

326
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,200
For a couple of months, nothing happened.

327
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,000
Then one night, a few days before Christmas,  

328
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,440
Bruno told Luca he had a friend who 
wanted a private meeting with him.

329
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,160
Who is he?' Luca wanted to know.

330
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,800
'Just a friend,' said Bruno.

331
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,080
'He wants to offer you something.

332
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,360
Can you meet him here, after the club closes?  

333
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,760
Four o'clock tomorrow morning?' Luca 
went back to his room and got ready.

334
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,840
He thought for a moment about 
calling the Godfather to tell  

335
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,520
him about the meeting, but decided not to.

336
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,200
Don Corleone never talked over the phone.

337
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,320
As well as this, his job was completely secret.

338
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,800
Not even Sonny or Tom Hagen knew what 
the Godfather had asked him to do.

339
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:31,040
So he took out a gun, hid it under 
his jacket, lay on the bed and waited.

340
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,800
Luca arrived at the night-club 
just before four in the morning.

341
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,080
The doorman had gone, but the door was open.

342
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:48,160
Inside, the club was dark and empty, 
except for one man standing behind the bar.

343
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,400
It was Bruno Tattaglia.

344
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,080
Luca walked across to the bar and sat down.

345
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,240
Bruno offered him a drink, 
but Luca shook his head.

346
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,520
Moments later, a second man in 
a dark coat and grey hat moved  

347
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,720
out of the shadows and stood 
next to Bruno behind the bar.

348
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:16,000
'Do you know who I am?' he said 
in Italian, his face in shadow.

349
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,120
'I know you,' Luca replied.

350
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,760
'You're Sollozzo.'

351
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,240
'We need a man like you,' said Sollozzo.

352
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
'Strong and dangerous.

353
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,320
I understand you're not happy 
with the Corleone family.

354
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,000
Do you want to join me?'

355
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
'If the money's good.'

356
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,120
'$50,000 to start with.'

357
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,000
Luca nodded slowly, pretending to think.

358
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,560
Sollozzo held out his hand.

359
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,600
'Do you agree?'

360
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,160
Luca looked at Sollozzo's 
hand but he didn't take it.

361
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,240
Instead he took out a cigarette 
and put it in his mouth.

362
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,640
Bruno moved forward with a lighter.

363
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,720
Luca rested his hands on the bar, 
bent forward and lit his cigarette.

364
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:16,680
Bruno put the lighter in his pocket, smiled at 
Luca and gently touched the back of Luca's hand.

365
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:25,240
Then suddenly, without warning, he took Luca's 
arm with his other hand and held it tight.

366
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:33,000
At the same moment, Sollozzo pulled out a knife 
and pushed it straight through Luca's hand.

367
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,400
Before Luca could move, a third man stepped out  

368
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,960
of the shadows behind him and threw 
a thin cord around his thick neck.

369
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,160
The cord pulled tight.

370
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,080
He tried to fight, but he couldn't get 
his hands up to the cord around his neck.

371
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,560
They had planned everything perfectly.

372
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,400
While Sollozzo and Bruno 
Tattaglia held one hand down, his  

373
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,440
other hand was pinned to the bar with the knife.

374
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,280
The cord pulled tighter and tighter,  

375
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:12,280
cutting into his throat until he finally 
stopped moving and fell slowly to the floor.

376
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:19,480
But Sollozzo, Tattaglia and the other man 
did not let him go for several more minutes.

377
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:28,120
They needed to be sure that Luca Brasi, the most 
dangerous man in the Corleone family, was dead.

378
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,600
Later on the same day, Tom 
Hagen came out of a large  

379
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,120
shop carrying Christmas presents for his children.

380
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,880
Sollozzo was standing in 
the street, waiting for him.

381
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,080
'Happy Christmas, Tom,' Sollozzo smiled.

382
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,840
Tom nodded nervously.

383
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,160
'I'm glad I met you,' Sollozzo 
continued in a friendly voice.

384
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,800
'I want to talk to you.'

385
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:00,280
'I haven't got time, 'Tom 
said, and began to walk away.

386
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,320
But two men stepped forward and stopped him.

387
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:11,240
'Make time, Consigliori,' Sollozzo 
said, suddenly less friendly.

388
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,760
'Get in the car.' Then, noticing 
the look of fear in Tom's eyes,  

389
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,480
added quickly: 'Don't be frightened.

390
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,400
If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already.

391
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,200
Trust me.'

392
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:32,080
Without a word, Tom got into the car.

393
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,760
Later that same afternoon, not knowing 
that Sollozzo had killed Luca Brasi and  

394
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:44,680
had kidnapped Tom Hagen, Don Corleone finished 
his work in the offices of his fruit company.

395
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,000
He put on his coat and said to Fredo,  

396
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,760
who was reading a newspaper: 'Tell 
Paulie Gatto to bring the car.

397
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,000
I want to go home.'

398
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,160
'I'll have to get it myself,' Fredo replied.

399
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,800
'Gatto's sick today.'

400
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,880
Don Corleone looked annoyed.

401
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,840
'That's the third time this month.

402
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,800
Maybe we'd better get another man for the job.'

403
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,120
Fredo jumped to his feet.

404
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,520
'No, I'll get the car.

405
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,040
It's OK,' he said.

406
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,120
'Paulie's a good boy.

407
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,920
If he says he's sick, he's sick.'

408
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:32,080
Don Corleone waited inside the door until 
he saw Fredo park the car just outside.

409
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,000
There was snow in the air and it was getting dark.

410
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,160
He stepped on to the pavement and 
was about to get into the car when  

411
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:45,040
he decided to buy some fruit from the 
market on the other side of the street.

412
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:52,160
He crossed the road and showed the fruit-seller 
the exact oranges and grapes that he wanted.

413
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:58,120
He was so busy choosing fruit that he didn't 
see two men in black hats and long black  

414
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:04,080
coats turn the corner and walk 
quickly along the street towards him.

415
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,240
He took the bag of fruit 
and paid the fruit-seller.

416
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,080
Then he heard the sound of 
the two men running wards him.

417
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:21,200
Without thinking, he dropped the bag of fruit 
and surprisingly quickly for a man of his age,  

418
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,640
back across the street towards his car.

419
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:32,120
He had just reached the car when the two men 
pulled guns out of their coats and began to fire.

420
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,600
Don Corleone was hit several times in the back.

421
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,920
Fredo, on hearing the sound of 
guns, jumped out of the car;  

422
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,840
he was shaking so much with fear that he 
dropped his gun before he could use it.

423
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,240
But his appearance was enough.

424
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,160
On seeing him, the two men 
stopped shooting and ran away.

425
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:01,000
Fredo looked down and saw his father's 
body lying in a pool of blood.

426
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,920
Unable to believe what had happened, he 
sat down in the road next to his father,  

427
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:13,960
pulled off his hat and began to 
cry like a baby.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

428
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,760
CHAPTER FOUR

429
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,560
Sicilian Message

430
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,160
Late that night, Michael and Kay 
were coming out of a theatre.

431
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,680
Although they were staying in New York,  

432
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:32,360
Michael had told his family that he was in 
New Hampshire, over a hundred miles away.

433
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:39,480
'If I told my family we were in New York, we 
would have to see them right away,' he told Kay.

434
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,880
'Then we wouldn't be able to be alone together.'

435
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,600
The night was freezing, and Michael and Kay held  

436
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,880
each other closely as they walked 
slowly along the crowded pavement.

437
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,640
'What do you want for Christmas?' he asked Kay.

438
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,840
Kay laughed and kissed his frozen cheek.

439
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,760
'Just you,' she said.

440
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,760
They walked a little further, 
then suddenly Kay stopped.

441
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:13,040
Mike,' she said, looking behind 
her, her face white with shock.

442
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,120
'What's the matter?' said Mike, confused.

443
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,880
She took his hand and led him back to 
a newspaper shop they had just passed.

444
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,440
She pointed to a newspaper.

445
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,840
Michael picked it up.

446
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:34,040
'VITO CORLEONE SHOT FIVE TIMES' 
he read on the front page.

447
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,360
Opening it, he saw a photograph of his father.

448
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,960
'KILLERS SHOOT UNDERWORLD BOSS'.

449
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:48,520
Without looking at Kay, he ran across the 
street to a public telephone and rang Sonny.

450
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,880
'Sonny?' he said.

451
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,160
'It's Michael.

452
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,200
Is he all right?'

453
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,200
'We don't know yet, but he's hit 
bad, Mikey,' his brother said.

454
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,480
'Where have you been? We've been worried.'

455
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,800
Michael suddenly felt guilty about 
lying to his family about New Hampshire.

456
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,120
'I called.

457
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,160
Didn't Tom tell you?'

458
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,240
'No.

459
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,040
But come home, Mikey.

460
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,720
You should be with Mama.

461
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,600
We need you.'

462
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,960
Michael put down the phone.

463
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,800
Kay, who had followed him across the road, 
looked at him with tears in her eyes.

464
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,080
Michael kissed her and hugged her tightly.

465
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,040
Then, stepping away from her, he said:'

466
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,400
Go back to the hotel, Kay.

467
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,480
I've got to go home.'

468
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,760
As soon as Sonny had put down the 
phone, there was a knock on the door.

469
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,000
'They say he's dead, Sonny,' 
said Pete Clemenza as he came in.

470
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,480
Sonny took him roughly by the collar 
and threw him against the wall.

471
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,080
'Take it easy,' Clemenza cried.

472
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,800
Sonny took a deep breath and took his hands away.

473
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,320
'I'm sorry,' he said.

474
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,960
And then asked:

475
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,000
'How's Paulie?'

476
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,840
'Paulie wasn't there.

477
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,880
He was sick.'

478
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,840
'What do you mean? How many 
times has he been sick?'

479
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,880
'I don't know, Sonny,' Clemenza 
said, half afraid, half confused.

480
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,120
'Three, maybe four times.'

481
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,400
'Listen.

482
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,880
I don't care how sick he is.

483
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,520
I want you to bring him to my father's house now.

484
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,240
Do you understand?'

485
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,000
After Clemenza had gone, Sonny looked at his wife,  

486
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,800
who was standing nervously in the 
doorway, holding a crying baby.

487
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,160
He hugged and kissed them 
both, trying to calm them down.

488
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,800
Trying to calm himself down.

489
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,200
Suddenly, the phone rang again.

490
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:57,960
The voice on the other end 
was very soft, very gentle:

491
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,280
'We have Tom Hagen,' the voice said.

492
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,840
'In about three hours we'll let him go.

493
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,200
He'll have a message for you.

494
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,720
Don't do anything stupid until 
you've heard what he has to say.

495
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,040
Your father's dead.

496
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,640
Let's all keep clear-headed about this, OK?'

497
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,120
'OK.' Although he felt like 
shouting, Sonny spoke quietly.

498
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,560
'I'll wait.'

499
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,000
He immediately left his house and crossed the 
private road to the one where his father lived.

500
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,920
He found his mother in the kitchen.

501
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,800
'Papa's hurt,' he told her.

502
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:48,680
'I don't know how bad.' His mother 
just said: 'I'll go and get ready.

503
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,640
I might be able to see him.' She 
didn't ask her son any questions.

504
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,440
A Sicilian woman was taught 
never to ask men questions.

505
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,640
Sonny took a mouthful of bread, went into 
his father's office and picked up the phone.

506
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:15,000
'Tessio? I want fifty good men here right away.' 
'What about Clemenza's people?' Tessio asked.

507
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,160
'No.

508
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,240
I don't want to use his men right now.'

509
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,720
Then he made a second call.

510
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,720
This time it was to a friend of his 
who worked for the telephone company.

511
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,400
'Farrell? I want you to do me a favour.

512
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,880
I want you to check two phone numbers for me.

513
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,040
Give me all the calls they made and 
received over the last three months.

514
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,080
It's very important.

515
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:49,240
Give me the information before midnight.' He gave 
him Paulie Gatto's and Pete Clemenza's numbers.

516
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,480
Then he made a third call.

517
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,360
He phoned Luca Brasi.

518
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,440
But this time there was no answer.

519
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,320
When Michael arrived, he found his 
father's house full of men he didn't know.

520
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,280
He went into the living-room, shook 
hands with a sad-looking Pete Clemenza,  

521
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,920
kissed Tom Hagen's wife on the cheek, then 
went into his father's corner-room office.

522
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,640
Sonny was sitting with Tessio, talking quietly.

523
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,720
When he saw Michael, he 
stood up and ran towards him.

524
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,800
'I'm really glad to see you,' he 
said, hugging his brother warmly.

525
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,720
'Mama's at the hospital with the old man.

526
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:40,400
He's going to be OK, thank God.' But then he 
saw Michael sit down, and he stopped smiling.

527
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,080
'What are you doing?' he said.

528
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:49,600
'I'm talking important business with 
Tessio.' 'Maybe I can help, 'Michael said.

529
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,160
'If you stay here, you'll hear things 
you shouldn't,' Sonny warned him.

530
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,960
'The old man will kill me if he finds out.'

531
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,720
Michael stared at his brother.

532
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,960
'He's my father too,' he said quietly.

533
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:11,080
'OK,' said Sonny, annoyed at 
Michael's refusal to leave.

534
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,160
'You want to hear? Then I'll tell you.

535
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,240
Whose head do we shoot off,  

536
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,920
Paulie's or Clemenza's? One of them 
betrayed the old man to Sollozzo.

537
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,480
Who do you think it was?'

538
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,800
If Sonny was hoping to shock 
Michael, he didn't succeed.

539
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,640
His younger brother just 
looked at him coldly and said:

540
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,840
'Not Clemenza.'

541
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:40,960
Sonny stared at his brother for a moment, 
then looked at Tessio with disbelief.

542
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,560
'I don't believe it.

543
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,640
The college boy's right.

544
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,320
It was Paulie.

545
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,520
I had their numbers checked.

546
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:54,160
While Paulie was sick, he got phone 
calls from Sollozzo's people.'

547
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,320
Michael got up and stood in front of his brother.

548
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,640
'Is there going to be a war, Sonny?' he said.

549
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,280
'Of course there is.

550
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,040
Unless the old man tells me different.

551
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,560
Sollozzo's a dead man.

552
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:15,920
I'm going to hit all five families if I have 
to The Tattaglias are going to eat dirt.'

553
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,920
'Wait, Sonny' Michael said with 
a look of warning in his eyes.

554
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,760
'This isn't how Papa would do it.'

555
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,800
Just then, they heard loud voices from outside 
the door, and the sound of people laughing.

556
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Sonny Michael and Tessio rushed out of 
the room and saw Tom Hagen standing at  

557
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,840
the front door, hugging his wife and smiling.

558
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:49,680
Sonny, Tom, Clemenza and Tessio sat 
in the Godfather's office, talking.

559
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,000
They were planning to kill Sollozzo, 
wondering where Luca Brasi was,  

560
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
thinking about what to do if the Godfather died.

561
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,320
Michael sat by the desk, listening to the 
conversation, but not permitted to speak.

562
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,560
There was a knock at the door, 
and Paulie Gatto came in.

563
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,480
He was blowing his nose, and looked very ill.

564
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,880
'There's a man at the gate,' 
Paulie said, looking at Sonny.

565
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,640
'He's got something for you.'

566
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,320
Sonny sent Tessio out to see what it was.

567
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,920
Then he smiled at Paulie.

568
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,080
'Are you OK, Paulie?' he asked.

569
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,480
'Why don't you go to the kitchen and get 
something to drink? You look terrible.'

570
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,640
When Paulie had gone, Sonny turned to Clemenza.

571
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,800
'I want you to kill him tomorrow,' he said.

572
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,960
'He betrayed the old man to Sollozzo.

573
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,960
I don't want to see him again.'

574
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,920
Clemenza hid his surprise and just nodded.

575
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,240
To him, it was just a job.

576
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,720
Then Tessio came into the room.

577
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,080
He was carrying something inside 
a large piece of brown paper.

578
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,040
He gave it to Sonny, and stepped back.

579
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,480
Sonny opened the paper.

580
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,440
Inside, there was Luca Brasi's jacket.

581
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,720
And inside the jacket, there was a dead fish.

582
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,880
Sonny looked up at Tessio, confused.

583
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,880
'What's this?' he asked.

584
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:30,280
'It's a Sicilian message,' Tessio said 
in his deep but strangely gentle voice.

585
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:39,560
'It means that Luca Brasi sleeps 
with the fishes.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

586
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,120
CHAPTER FIVE

587
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Seeds of Revenge

588
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,160
The next night, before going to 
visit his father in hospital,  

589
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,440
Michael had dinner with Kay in the hotel.

590
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,560
They didn't talk much.

591
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,800
Kay kept looking across the table 
at him, worried by his silence.

592
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:06,440
Finally, he put down his glass of wine, 
stood up and said: 'I have to go.'

593
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,240
'Can I come with you?' Kay 
said, staring at her food.

594
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,680
'There'll be policemen at the hospital,' 
Michael said, putting on his coat.

595
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,640
'Reporters too.

596
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,080
I don't want to get you mixed up in this.'

597
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,480
Kay looked at him sadly.

598
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,760
She understood that, since the shooting 
of his father, he was different.

599
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,520
He was more distant from her.

600
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,040
'When will I see you again?' she asked quietly.

601
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,160
Michael found it difficult 
to look her in the eyes.

602
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,800
'Go back to your parents 
and I'll call you,' he said.

603
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:55,720
But Kay repeated her question: 'When will I see 
you again?' This time, Michael looked at her.

604
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,840
'I don't know,' he said, touching 
her gently on the shoulder.

605
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:09,680
Then, without another word, he left her sitting 
alone at the table and walked towards the door.

606
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,920
When Michael got out of the taxi,  

607
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,680
he was surprised to see that the street 
outside the hospital was quiet and empty.

608
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,840
When he climbed the steps and 
went through the front door,  

609
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:26,720
he was even more surprised to find that 
there was nobody inside the hospital either.

610
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,760
'Where are Tessio's and Clemenza's men?'  

611
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,680
he thought nervously as he took 
the lift up to the fourth floor.

612
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,120
There was nobody outside his father's room.

613
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,280
Michael opened the door slowly and walked inside.

614
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,840
His father was lying in bed; 
glass bottles hung next to him.

615
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,880
As Michael stood by the bed and 
looked down at his sleeping father,  

616
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,960
he heard a noise behind him in the doorway.

617
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,760
He turned quickly.

618
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,920
It was only a nurse.

619
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,600
'What are you doing here?' she whispered angrily.

620
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,840
'I'm Michael Corleone.

621
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,720
This is my father.

622
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,400
There's nobody here.

623
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,520
What happened to the guards?'

624
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,600
'Your father had too many visitors.

625
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,160
The police came and made them 
all leave ten minutes ago.'

626
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,280
Michael thought quickly.

627
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,400
He picked up the phone by the bed and told Sonny 
to send some people to the hospital at once.

628
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,840
Then he told the nurse to help him 
move his father's bed to another room.

629
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,360
When she complained, he said:

630
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:38,480
'You know my father? Men 
are coming here to kill him.

631
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,080
You understand? Now help me, please.'

632
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,560
As Michael and the nurse were pushing 
the bed carefully through the narrow  

633
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,840
door of another room, they heard the 
sound of someone coming up the stairs.

634
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,480
Michael closed the door quietly 
and looked through the window.

635
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,360
He saw a man in a black hat and 
long black coat carrying flowers.

636
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:07,600
Michael didn't know who he was, but 
decided that he didn't look like a killer.

637
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,040
'Who are you?' he said, opening the door.

638
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,240
The man turned round, surprised.

639
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,240
'I am Enzo,' he said.

640
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:22,480
'The butcher.' 'Listen, Enzo,' Michael said.

641
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
'You'd better get out of here.

642
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,600
There's going to be trouble.'

643
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,680
Enzo lifted his head and 
looked at Michael proudly.

644
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,920
'If there is trouble, I stay here to help you.

645
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,280
For your father.'

646
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,200
Michael didn't argue.

647
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,480
He needed help.

648
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,520
'Go outside,' he told Enzo,' and 
stand in front of the hospital.

649
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:53,400
I'll be out in a minute.' He went back into 
the dark room and looked down at his father.

650
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:59,240
'It's all right, Papa,' he whispered, 
softly touching his father's grey hair.

651
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,800
'I'll take care of you now.'

652
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,800
He bent down to kiss his father's hand and,  

653
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,400
when he looked up, he saw a tear 
in the corner of his father's eye.

654
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,800
Michael found Enzo outside on the 
steps in front of the hospital.

655
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,280
He threw Enzo's flowers away, turned up the collar  

656
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:24,520
of Enzo's coat and told him to put his 
hand in his pocket as if he had a gun.

657
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,920
They waited nervously in the icy cold and dark.

658
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,920
A few minutes later, the silence was broken  

659
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,040
by the soft sound of an engine 
moving slowly along the street.

660
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,600
Michael and Enzo held their breath as a long black  

661
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,720
car appeared in front of the 
hospital gates and stopped.

662
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,360
Shadowy shapes of men in 
hats moved inside the car.

663
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,440
They seemed to be talking to each other.

664
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,160
Then the car moved quickly away.

665
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,000
Michael smiled at Enzo.

666
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,720
'You did well,' he said.

667
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,960
Enzo smiled and took out a packet of 
cigarettes, but his hands were shaking.

668
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,680
Michael lit a cigarette for him.

669
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,800
To his surprise, his own 
hands weren't shaking at all.

670
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,720
He felt completely calm.

671
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,960
Suddenly, there was the sound of police cars,  

672
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,760
and the street outside the 
hospital was filled with policemen.

673
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:32,640
'Good old Sonny,' Michael smiled as 
he walked down the steps to meet them.

674
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,720
What happened next took 
him completely by surprise.

675
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,160
Two policemen took him roughly by the 
arms while a third policeman searched him.

676
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:49,200
A huge police captain with a strong red 
face and white hair walked towards him.

677
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,280
'I thought I locked all you gangsters 
up,' he said angrily to Michael.

678
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,120
'Who are you?'

679
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:02,440
Michael looked up into the police 
captain's fiery eyes and said, unafraid:

680
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,120
'What happened to the men 
guarding my father, captain?'

681
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,920
'You little animal!' the captain shouted.

682
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,360
'Don't tell me my business!

683
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,640
Now, get out of here and stay 
away from this hospital!'

684
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:23,240
The policemen let go of Michael's 
arms, but Michael didn't move.

685
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:29,600
'I'm not going until you put some guards 
outside my father's room,' he said.

686
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:34,120
The captain shouted to his men: 'Take him away!'

687
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,920
Michael stared at him coldly.

688
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,120
'What's Sollozzo paying you 
to betray my father, captain?'

689
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,800
At this, the captain lost all control.

690
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,080
'Hold his arms!' he told the 
policemen behind Michael.

691
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:54,240
Then, as they held him, he 
hit Michael hard in the face.

692
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,760
Before he could hit Michael again, 
another car suddenly arrived.

693
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,880
It was Tom Hagen with a group 
of men to guard the Godfather.

694
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,720
Tom saw Michael's face covered in blood and said:  

695
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:17,200
'Do you want to report this?' Michael had trouble 
talking, but he managed to say: 'That's OK, Tom.

696
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:24,040
It was an accident.' As he spoke, he didn't 
take his eyes off the police captain.

697
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,960
He tried to smile.

698
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:31,240
He didn't want to show anyone how 
he really felt at that moment.

699
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:39,240
Seeds of revenge were growing 
in his icy heart.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

700
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,920
CHAPTER SIX

701
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,200
Nothing Personal

702
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,360
The entrance to the private road 
where the Corleone family lived  

703
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,600
was crowded with cars and men with guns.

704
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:58,280
As Michael and Clemenza got out of the car 
together and walked in, Tessio came to meet them.

705
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,200
'Why all the guns?' Clemenza asked.

706
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,720
'We'll need them,' Tessio said.

707
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:11,880
'After Sollozzo tried to kill the 
Don at the hospital, Sonny got angry.

708
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:17,160
We killed Bruno Tattaglia at 
four o'clock this morning.'

709
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:22,280
Inside the house, Sonny was 
in an excited, happy mood.

710
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,040
He held Michael's badly bruised 
face in his hands and laughed.

711
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,400
'Hey Mikey, you look beautiful!'

712
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,920
Michael pushed his brother's hands away and went 
to pour himself a drink to take away the pain.

713
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,000
'Hey, Tom,' Sonny said, 
turning to the Consigliori.

714
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,560
'Listen to this.

715
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,480
Sollozzo wants to talk.

716
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,920
He wants us to send Michael to hear 
his offer.' Tom looked worried.

717
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,200
Sonny was talking and laughing 
as if it was all a joke.

718
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:02,200
'Perhaps we should hear what Sollozzo has to 
say,' he said, 'We don't want another war.'

719
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,120
Sonny stopped smiling at once.

720
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,800
'No!' he said, suddenly angry.

721
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,120
'No more.

722
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,680
Not this time.

723
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,680
No more meetings.

724
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,400
No more Sollozzo tricks.

725
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,920
I want Sollozzo dead.

726
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,960
If not, we'll have a war!'

727
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,880
'You're taking things too personally,' 
Tom said, getting angry too.

728
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,080
'This is business.'

729
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,720
'I don't want your advice,' Sonny said.

730
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,400
'I just want you to help me win, all right?'

731
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,680
When everybody had calmed down,  

732
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,200
Tom explained to Sonny why he thought 
killing Sollozzo was a bad idea.

733
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,320
'Sollozzo's paying the police captain 
who hit Michael a lot of money.

734
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,400
His name's McCluskey.

735
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,120
He's agreed to be Sollozzo's 
bodyguard at the meeting.

736
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:02,920
Now you must understand, Sonny, that you 
can't kill Sollozzo while he's with McCluskey.

737
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,520
Nobody's ever shot a New York police captain.

738
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,040
It would be a disaster.

739
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,040
All the five families would come after you.

740
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,280
All our important friends would disappear.

741
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,640
We'd have no friends in the world.

742
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,880
We'd be finished!'

743
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:25,080
Sonny listened to Tom carefully, 
and finally agreed to wait.

744
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:32,800
But Michael, who had heard the whole conversation 
from his armchair said: 'We can't wait.'

745
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:39,520
Sonny and Tom stared at him in surprise, 
but Michael went on thoughtfully:  

746
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:47,120
'We've got to kill Sollozzo before he 
kills Papa.' Tom thought for a moment,  

747
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:52,640
and then said quietly: 'Mike's 
right.' 'But you just told me  

748
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:59,720
we can't kill him because of McCluskey!' 
Sonny said, waving one arm angrily at Tom.

749
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:06,080
'They want to have a meeting, right?' Michael 
began to take control of the conversation.

750
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,960
'Find out where it's going to be.

751
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:16,800
If Clemenza can think of a way of hiding a gun 
there, I'll kill them both.' There was a long  

752
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:23,280
silence as everybody looked at each other in 
disbelief at what they had heard Michael say.

753
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,200
Then Clemenza laughed, closely 
followed by Sonny and Tessio.

754
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,680
Only Tom looked serious.

755
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,800
He knew that Michael wasn't joking.

756
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,480
'Hey,' Sonny laughed, walking 
up and down in front of Michael,  

757
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,160
who sat strangely still in his armchair 
looking straight in front of him.

758
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,560
'What are you going to do? Nice college boy.

759
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:51,920
You want to kill a police captain because 
he hit you in the face? This is business.

760
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,920
You're taking it too personally.'

761
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,320
Tom smiled to himself.

762
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,880
He had used those exact words 
to Sonny minutes earlier.

763
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,240
Michael became angry.

764
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,360
'This is a policeman who's mixed up in drugs.

765
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,000
He's dishonest.' He turned to Tom.

766
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,240
'Listen, if he's killed, our friends in the 
newspapers will make a good story out of it.

767
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,440
Isn't that true, Tom?'

768
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:26,320
Tom looked at Michael thoughtfully for a 
second before saying: 'You might be right.'

769
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,440
'All right, all right!' Sonny held up his hands.

770
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,960
He gave Michael long, hard look,  

771
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,880
then shook his head as if he didn't 
want to hear what he was saying.

772
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,400
'OK, we'll do it.

773
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,680
Clemenza will teach you 
everything you need to know.

774
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,240
We'll take care of everything.

775
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:52,200
When it's over, things'll be very 
bad, but that'll be our problem.

776
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,280
You'll be out of it, Mikey.

777
00:55:54,280 --> 00:56:01,560
We'll make you disappear for a nice long holiday 
until things calm down.' He looked at Michael,  

778
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:09,040
and added in a quiet voice filled with respect 
for his younger brother: 'You can do it, Mikey.

779
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,800
I know you can.' Michael smiled.

780
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,560
He was beginning to feel a real Corleone at last.

781
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:23,960
'I learnt things from my father too,' he said.

782
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,520
Eventually, after a lot of nervous  

783
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:31,480
preparation, the meeting between 
Michael and Sollozzo was arranged.

784
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:36,640
At the last minute, Sonny was able to 
discover where it was going to take place:  

785
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,640
a small family restaurant in 
the Bronx called 'Louie's'.

786
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:48,800
Michael waited alone, as agreed with Sollozzo, 
outside Dempsey's restaurant on Broadway.

787
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:55,520
Finally, a large black car stopped in front of 
him, and Michael got into the passenger seat.

788
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,480
In the back seat sat Sollozzo 
and Captain McCluskey,  

789
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,600
although this evening the 
policeman was not in uniform.

790
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:10,000
Sollozzo put a friendly hand on Michael's 
shoulder and said: I'm glad you came, Mike.

791
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,840
We're going to solve all our problems tonight.'

792
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:22,760
'I don't want anyone to try to hurt my father 
again,' Michael replied in a quiet, cold voice.

793
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,560
'Don't worry,' Sollozzo said warmly.

794
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,360
'He'll be safe.

795
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,040
I promise.

796
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,680
But please keep an open mind when we talk.

797
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,040
I hope you're not a hothead 
like your brother, Sonny.

798
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,640
You can't talk business with him.' Just then,  

799
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:45,160
McCluskey moved forward in his 
seat and offered Michael his hand.

800
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,920
'You're a good boy,' he said 
in a strong, friendly voice.

801
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,760
'I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

802
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,760
Nothing personal, I hope.

803
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,280
I'm getting too old for my job, I guess.'

804
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:03,800
Without turning round, Michael shook 
the policeman's hand over his shoulder.

805
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,040
'And now I'm afraid I've got 
to search you,' McCluskey said.

806
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,960
'So turn round please, on your knees'.

807
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,600
Michael did as he was asked.

808
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:20,480
'He's clean,' McCluskey said at 
last, sitting back next to Sollozzo.

809
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,360
Michael slowly put his hat back on his head,  

810
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,120
and stared out of the window 
with a dead look in his eyes.

811
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,760
Half an hour later, McCluskey, 
Sollozzo and Michael were sitting  

812
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,080
at a small round table in the 
middle of a quiet restaurant.

813
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:41,840
'How's the Italian food here? 'McCluskey 
asked Sollozzo with real interest.

814
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,480
'Good,' Sollozzo replied.

815
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,960
'The best in the city.'

816
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,880
When the waiter had poured 
wine into their glasses,  

817
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,160
Sollozzo began to talk to Michael in Italian.

818
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,560
'I have great respect for your father,' he said.

819
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,840
'What happened between him 
and me is just business.

820
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,680
His thinking is old-fashioned.

821
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,360
Let's forget these disagreements.

822
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:15,720
I want peace.' Michael tried to reply in 
Italian, but he couldn't think of the words.

823
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,040
So he spoke English instead.

824
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:25,280
'You must promise me that no one 
will try to kill my father again.'

825
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,960
Sollozzo looked at Michael in wide-eyed innocence.

826
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,200
'You think too much of me,' he said.

827
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,800
'I'm the one in danger, not your father.

828
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,200
I'm not as clever as you think.

829
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,320
All I want is peace.'

830
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,520
Michael looked at McCluskey.

831
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:48,080
The policeman seemed more interested 
in his food than the conversation.

832
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:48,840
He turned back to

833
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:55,320
Sollozzo, thought for a moment, then 
said: 'I have to go 'to the bathroom.

834
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,040
Is that OK?'

835
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,360
'No problem,' said McCluskey.

836
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,800
But Sollozzo didn't like it.

837
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,640
When Michael stood up, he stopped 
him and searched him very carefully.

838
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:13,080
Finally satisfied that Michael wasn't 
carrying a gun, he sat down again.

839
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:18,720
'Don't take too long,' he said, 
staring at Michael moodily.

840
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,000
Michael found the gun hidden in the toilet.

841
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,080
Clemenza had done his job well.

842
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:29,360
He pushed the gun into the top of 
his trousers, buttoned his jacket,  

843
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:35,120
took a few deep breaths to calm himself 
down, and returned to the restaurant.

844
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:39,120
Sollozzo was sitting with his 
back to him, smoking a cigarette.

845
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:43,720
McCluskey looked at Michael out of the 
corner of his eye, but went on eating.

846
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,120
Sollozzo turned round.

847
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,640
Michael walked back to his chair and sat down.

848
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:56,000
Sollozzo began talking again in Italian, 
but Michael couldn't understand a word.

849
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,960
He wasn't listening.

850
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:04,440
All he could hear was the sound of his 
heart, the thunder of blood between his ears.

851
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,320
Somewhere behind the restaurant 
there was the sound of a train.

852
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,320
It was getting louder.

853
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,360
McCluskey went on eating greedily.

854
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:19,200
Sollozzo moved his face closer to Michael's 
to talk above the noise of the train.

855
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,120
Now was the moment.

856
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,520
Now!

857
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,200
Michael jumped to his feet, 
pulled the gun from his trousers,  

858
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,240
pointed it straight at Sollozzo's head and fired.

859
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,640
The bullet hit Sollozzo between the eyes.

860
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:39,920
McCluskey stared at Sollozzo in surprise, 
as if watching something far away.

861
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,320
He did not seem to realize his own danger.

862
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,920
His fork was half-way to his mouth.

863
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:51,360
He was just beginning to understand what 
was happening when Michael fired at him.

864
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,920
The shot was bad.

865
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,120
It hit McCluskey in the throat.

866
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:01,440
He dropped his fork, put his hands to his 
neck and began to cough up food and blood.

867
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:09,600
Very carefully, very coolly, Michael fired the 
next bullet straight into the policeman's brain.

868
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:17,360
McCluskey stared at Michael for a second then fell 
forward, his head hitting the table with a crash.

869
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,720
Michael turned away.

870
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,000
He let the gun fall from his hand 
and, looking straight in front of him,  

871
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,840
he walked quickly out of the 
restaurant, round the corner  

872
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:32,440
and into the car where Tessio was 
waiting to drive him away.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

873
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,280
CHAPTER SEVEN

874
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,560
Apollonia

875
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:43,720
After the shooting of Captain McCluskey, the 
police took revenge on all five New York families.

876
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:48,960
The Five Families War of 1946 had begun.

877
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,200
But Michael wasn't there.

878
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,080
He was hiding thousands of miles away, in Sicily.

879
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:03,360
He was staying with Don Tommasino, a friend 
of his father's and a Godfather himself.

880
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:08,120
In the evenings, Michael sat in a 
huge garden filled with flowers,  

881
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:12,920
drinking wine and hearing 
old stories about his family.

882
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:18,840
During the day, he walked in the Sicilian 
countryside, dressed in old clothes.

883
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:25,760
Two bodyguards, Fabrizio and Calo, went everywhere 
with him, carrying guns over their shoulders.

884
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,680
Michael often thought of Kay during 
these long walks in the white hot sun.

885
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:39,120
He felt sad and guilty that he had left 
America without saying goodbye to her.

886
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:43,240
One morning, seven months 
after arriving in Sicily,  

887
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:49,240
Michael decided to walk into the mountains 
past the hilltop town of Corleone.

888
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:53,720
He walked with his two bodyguards 
along dusty country roads,  

889
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:57,200
past fruit-trees and fields of flowers.

890
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:02,360
The hot, still air was rich 
with the smell of oranges.

891
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:07,880
Along the way, they met a group of 
girls and children picking flowers.

892
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,680
They stopped to watch them pass.

893
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:15,760
One girl in a simple dress with 
a basket over her arm stopped  

894
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,520
in front of Michael to pick a small pink flower.

895
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:25,720
Michael watched her, studying the way that 
her long, brown hair shone in the sunlight  

896
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,840
and hung around her face.

897
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:33,720
Suddenly, the girl lifted 
her head and looked at him.

898
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:41,240
She had large brown eyes, and her heart- 
shaped mouth was red with the juice of grapes.

899
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:45,480
Michael felt weak, as if hit by lightning.

900
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,080
He had never seen anyone so lovely.

901
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,440
The girl lowered her eyes with a shy smile,  

902
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:57,280
ran back to join her friends 
and disappeared down the road.

903
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,640
Fabrizio noticed the look on 
Michael's face and laughed.

904
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:05,920
'Let's go and find out who she is,' he suggested.

905
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:11,880
Michael agreed, and followed Fabrizio 
and Calo down a narrow path towards  

906
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:15,760
the village where the girls and children had gone.

907
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,480
In the village, they sat at 
a table outside a small cafe.

908
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:26,120
The owner of the cafe was a short man 
with white hair and a dark moustache.

909
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,520
He was a friendly man and 
he smiled as he served them,  

910
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:33,120
not worried at all by the fact 
that his customers carried guns.

911
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:43,160
When Fabrizio asked the cafe owner about the 
beautiful girl they had seen picking flowers,  

912
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:47,960
and described her to him, 
a strange thing happened.

913
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:56,000
The man stopped smiling, looked at the three 
men angrily, and disappeared inside the cafe.

914
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,480
Fabrizio followed him inside and, 
moments later, ran out looking nervous.

915
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,680
'Quick, we must go,' he said to Michael.

916
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,480
'He's really angry.

917
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,400
The girl's his daughter.'

918
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,880
But Michael didn't move.

919
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:18,600
He stared at Fabrizio and 
said: 'I want to speak to him.'

920
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:25,560
Fabrizio quickly drank some wine, picked up his 
gun and went inside to bring the man to Michael.

921
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:31,960
The cafe owner appeared with two 
young, strong-looking men at his side.

922
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,960
They were his sons.

923
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:39,560
He looked down at Michael without 
speaking, a hard look in his eye.

924
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:42,760
Michael spoke to him quietly.

925
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:46,840
'I'm sorry if I made you angry,' he said.

926
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,000
I'm an American hiding in Sicily.

927
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,360
My name's Michael.

928
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,520
You can tell the police, and make a lot of money.

929
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:03,040
But then your daughter would lose a 
father instead of getting a husband.

930
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:07,320
With your agreement, I would 
like to meet your daughter.

931
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,160
With all respect.'

932
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,880
The cafe owner's face softened.

933
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,600
He looked with interest at Michael,  

934
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:21,480
this young man with the strange mixture 
of softness and confidence in his voice.

935
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:27,480
He noticed that the two men with guns 
looked at this young man with great respect.

936
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:33,000
He was obviously important, and probably rich.

937
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,160
'Come on Sunday afternoon,' he said.

938
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:45,440
'My name is Vitelli and my house is up 
there in the hills, above the village.'

939
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:51,480
'And what's you daughter's name?' Michael 
said, standing up and shaking the man's hand.

940
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,440
'Apollonia, 'the cafe owner smiled.

941
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:04,800
That Sunday, Michael, dressed in his best clothes, 
brought presents for Apollonia and all her family.

942
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,520
He gave Apollonia some jewellery.

943
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:12,120
He began to visit the family 
home regularly after that.

944
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:18,280
One evening, at the dinner table, he noticed that 
she was wearing the jewellery he had given her.

945
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:22,320
It was her way of saying that she liked him.

946
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:27,000
He invited her for a walk in 
the country, and she agreed.

947
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,520
They walked side by side, but they 
were careful not to touch each other.

948
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,920
They were not alone.

949
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,880
All the women in Apollonia's family walked  

950
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:44,520
behind them, followed by Calo and 
Fabrizio, carrying their guns.

951
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:49,120
Two weeks later, Michael 
and Apollonia got married.

952
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:53,840
Compared to his sister's wedding to 
Carlo in New York two years earlier,  

953
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,880
it was a simple Sicilian wedding.

954
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:02,320
Apollonia wore white while all 
the other women wore black.

955
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:06,440
The villagers stood in the streets 
and threw flowers as the couple  

956
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:11,680
passed on foot from the church to 
Apollonia's house in the hills.

957
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:18,640
The wedding guests walked behind the couple and, 
behind the guests, there was a band of musicians.

958
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,200
The wedding party went on until midnight.

959
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,600
Then Michael took Apollonia away, and drove her  

960
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:32,120
to Don Tommasino's house 
outside Corleone.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

961
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,640
CHAPTER EIGHT

962
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:37,720
A Bridge Too Far

963
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:44,680
Two years after their wedding, Connie 
and Carlo Rizzi were not happily married.

964
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,520
Carlo drank a lot and saw other women.

965
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:54,200
Connie shouted at him all the 
time, and Carlo used to hit her.

966
01:09:54,200 --> 01:10:00,120
One day, Sonny visited his sister and 
saw her face was covered in bruises.

967
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:08,480
He became very angry and, although Connie tried 
to stop him, he rushed away to find Carlo.

968
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:13,120
He found Carlo sitting outside 
the betting shop where he worked.

969
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:17,320
Sonny jumped out of his car 
and ran quickly towards him.

970
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:25,120
Carlo tried to escape, but Sonny dived and caught 
him by the ankles, pulling him down with a crash.

971
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:32,920
Then, while Carlo was still on the ground, Sonny 
kicked and hit him, screaming at him all the time.

972
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,240
Carlo didn't try to fight.

973
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,320
He stayed on his knees and 
covered his head with his hands.

974
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,400
Finally, Sonny grew tired.

975
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,920
He looked down at Carlo's 
bruised and bloody body and said:

976
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:54,200
'If you ever touch my sister again, 
I'll kill you!' A few weeks later,  

977
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,240
the telephone rang in the 
kitchen of Don Corleone's house.

978
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,880
Sonny was called to the phone.

979
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,200
It was Connie, and she was crying.

980
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:09,000
Carlo had hit her badly, 
and she wanted to come home.

981
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:14,600
As he listened, Sonny's face 
went red and he began to shake.

982
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,440
'I'm coming right over,' he told his sister.

983
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,520
'Just wait there.'

984
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,920
'Please Sonny, don't ...' Connie began,  

985
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:28,880
but Sonny put down the phone and 
ran straight out of the house.

986
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:34,240
Tom Hagen tried to stop him, 
but Sonny refused to listen.

987
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:41,480
As Sonny drove quickly out of the gates, 
Tom told two bodyguards to follow him.

988
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:47,320
Between Long Island and the City of 
New York, there was a kind of bridge.

989
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:52,760
Before anyone could cross, they had 
to stop at the tollbooth and pay.

990
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,400
When Sonny arrived at the bridge, 
only one tollbooth was open.

991
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:01,360
He had to wait because another 
car was in front of him.

992
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:06,080
Sonny impatiently looked for 
some money in his jacket pocket.

993
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,520
The car in front of Sonny drove 
forward a little way and stopped.

994
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,120
Sonny drove up to the tollbooth.

995
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:20,440
He gave the man inside his money and tried to 
drive away, but the car was still in front of him.

996
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:25,160
The man in the tollbooth dropped the 
money and bent down to pick it up.

997
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,960
From the corner of his eye,  

998
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,600
Sonny noticed something moving in 
the empty tollbooth on his right.

999
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:37,560
He looked round and saw four men 
standing in the windows looking at him.

1000
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:44,120
At the same moment, two men got out of the 
car in front and began to walk towards him.

1001
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,800
They were carrying machine-guns.

1002
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,480
Sonny thought about driving 
backwards, but he was too late.

1003
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:58,400
In the second before anything happened, 
Sonny knew that he was a dead man.

1004
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,040
There was a sudden thunder of noise,  

1005
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:06,160
and bullets crashed through the 
windows of his car from all directions.

1006
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:11,920
Before Sonny could dive for cover, he was 
hit several times in the chest and head.

1007
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,120
But he was a strong man.

1008
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,880
He refused to die quietly.

1009
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:24,240
He pulled himself across the seat, opened the 
door and half jumped, half fell out of the car.

1010
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:29,640
He tried to pull his gun from his 
jacket, but bullets continued to hit him.

1011
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:34,240
At last, with a wild and angry look on his face,  

1012
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:39,760
he fell to the ground in a pool 
of blood and stopped moving.

1013
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:45,560
By the time the bodyguards that Tom had 
sent to follow him arrived, Sonny Corleone,  

1014
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:53,560
eldest son of Vito Corleone, was 
dead, and his killers were gone.

1015
01:13:53,560 --> 01:14:00,600
Later that night, Tom Hagen sat alone 
in Don Corleone's dark office, drinking.

1016
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,680
He couldn't believe that Sonny was dead.

1017
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,920
He heard the door behind him open and close.

1018
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:11,080
Turning round, he saw Don Corleone.

1019
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:16,080
He looked very old and tired as 
he walked stiffly across the room.

1020
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:21,440
He had lost weight, and his 
clothes hung loosely from his body.

1021
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:28,920
'Give me some wine,' he said as he lowered himself 
slowly into his favourite leather armchair.

1022
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:35,760
He waited while Tom poured him a 
drink, then half spoke, half whispered:

1023
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,080
'My wife was crying before she fell asleep.

1024
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:47,720
Outside my window, I saw Tessio and Clemenza 
coming to the house and it's midnight.

1025
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:55,000
So, Tom, I think you should tell your 
Don what everybody already knows.'

1026
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:01,360
'I was about to come up and tell you, 'Tom said.

1027
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:05,600
'But you needed a drink first.'

1028
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,320
'Yes,' Tom looked down, ashamed.

1029
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,840
'You've had your drink.

1030
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,360
You can tell me now.'

1031
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:20,360
Tom looked up, his eyes filled with tears.

1032
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:25,080
'They shot Sonny,' he said, his voice shaking.

1033
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,360
'He's dead.'

1034
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,440
Don Corleone closed his eyes.

1035
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:34,640
For a second he, too, seemed about to cry.

1036
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:39,680
But when he opened his eyes again, they were dry.

1037
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:45,040
'I want no revenge,' he said sadly.

1038
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:50,720
'I want you to arrange a meeting 
with the heads of the five families.

1039
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:54,920
This war stops now.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1040
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,560
CHAPTER NINE

1041
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,560
A Good American Wife

1042
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,880
In the first weeks of married life, 
Michael and Apollonia went for walks  

1043
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:13,000
in the hills and drove around the 
countryside in their small black car.

1044
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,880
But news of the wedding had 
reached Michael's enemies.

1045
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:22,840
Don Tommasino told Michael that it was 
too dangerous for him to leave the house.

1046
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:26,480
He put men with guns around 
the house to guard him,  

1047
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:32,680
and told Fabrizio and Calo to 
stay with Michael all the time.

1048
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:37,560
Although he was a prisoner in his 
home, Michael wasn't too unhappy.

1049
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,480
He had Apollonia.

1050
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:45,280
He spent the time teaching her how to 
speak English and how to drive the car.

1051
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:51,640
One morning, Don Tommasino came home 
to tell Michael that Sonny was dead.

1052
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,840
It wasn't safe for Michael to 
stay in the house any more.

1053
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:01,840
He had found a safe house outside Syracuse, 
and he would have to leave at once.

1054
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,600
Apollonia could live with 
her parents for a short time.

1055
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,320
She could join him later.

1056
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:15,840
The next morning, Michael stood at his bedroom 
window and saw Fabrizio sitting in a garden chair.

1057
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,160
'Get the car,' Michael called down.

1058
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,680
'I'm leaving in five minutes.'

1059
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,840
'Is your wife coming with you?' Fabrizio asked.

1060
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:31,680
'No, I want you to take her to her 
father's house until I'm safe.'

1061
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:35,880
Michael washed, then went downstairs 
to the kitchen, where he found.

1062
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,240
Calo having breakfast.

1063
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:41,560
'Where's Apollonia?' Michael asked.

1064
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:46,280
'She's in the car,' Calo 
said, his mouth full of bread.

1065
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,040
'You'll get a surprise.

1066
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,000
She's driving it alone.

1067
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,440
She'll make a good American wife.' 
Michael smiled and went outside.

1068
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:00,520
Apollonia was sitting in the 
car, her hands on the wheel.

1069
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:03,120
She laughed and waved at him.

1070
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:09,320
But Michael was annoyed to see Fabrizio 
about to disappear through the garden gates.

1071
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,800
'Fabrizio.

1072
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,080
Where are you going?' Michael called.

1073
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:20,880
Fabrizio looked over his shoulder at 
Michael, then continued to walk quickly away.

1074
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,840
Michael watched him go, confused at first.

1075
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,760
Then he looked at the car.

1076
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,680
Suddenly, without thinking, 
he realized there was danger.

1077
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,680
He shouted to Apollonia: 'No!

1078
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:38,200
No!' But she never heard him.

1079
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:42,800
There was a loud explosion and 
Michael was thrown to the ground.

1080
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:48,760
When he looked up, pieces of burning 
car were lying all over the garden.

1081
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:54,280
The bomb, which someone had intended 
for him, had killed his beautiful,  

1082
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:59,480
innocent wife instead.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1083
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,040
CHAPTER TEN

1084
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,520
No Revenge

1085
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:08,280
The secret meeting between the heads 
of the five New York families and all  

1086
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:14,480
the other important families in America 
took place in a large room above a bank.

1087
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:21,800
Everybody sat around a large table, each head 
with his Consigliori sitting close behind.

1088
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:28,720
Don Corleone, who had invited them all, 
was the first to stand up and speak.

1089
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:32,880
'How did things get so far?' he said.

1090
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:38,400
'It's so unnecessary.' He looked 
at the small man with dark,  

1091
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:43,760
oily hair and shadows under his 
eyes who was sitting opposite him.

1092
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,880
'Tattaglia, you've lost a son.

1093
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,720
I've lost a son too.

1094
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:57,360
Why can't we stop this foolish 
war now before more people die?'

1095
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:03,200
A handsome man with silver hair who sat 
at one end of the table began to speak.

1096
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,640
This was Barzini.

1097
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:10,240
'We all know Don Corleone 
is an honest man,' he said.

1098
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,680
'We can trust him.'

1099
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:16,120
'Yes,' Tattaglia said to Barzini.

1100
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:19,360
'He has many important friends.

1101
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:23,760
But he refused to share them with us.'

1102
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:30,560
'I only ever refused to help you once,' 
Don Corleone looked at Tattaglia.

1103
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,120
He was thinking about the meeting with Sollozzo.

1104
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:39,840
'I refused to help you because I 
don't like the drugs business.'

1105
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,040
'Times have changed,' Barzini said.

1106
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:47,960
'A man who refuses to help his 
friends is not a true friend.

1107
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:54,000
Don Corleone must share his important 
friends in Law and Government with us.

1108
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,760
We will pay him well for his help, of course.'

1109
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,920
The Godfathers talked for a long time.

1110
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:06,440
Finally Don Corleone said: 
'I'm a man you can trust.

1111
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:10,200
I'll do whatever I can for peace.'

1112
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,720
'Then we all agree,' Barzini smiled.

1113
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,920
'The drugs business will be 
permitted, but controlled.

1114
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:23,120
And Don Corleone will share 
his important friends with us.'

1115
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:32,200
'If Don Corleone promises not to take revenge 
on us for his son's death,' Tattaglia said.

1116
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:36,080
Don Corleone looked sadly at Tattaglia.

1117
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:41,560
'Is revenge going to bring 
your son back to you? Or my  

1118
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:47,680
boy to me? I promise, there will be no revenge.

1119
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:54,600
But only if my youngest son is 
permitted to come back safely.

1120
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:59,800
He has had to live abroad 
since that Sollozzo business.

1121
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,920
I want him home.

1122
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:07,320
But I warn you, if anything happens to my son - if  

1123
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:13,720
he mysteriously falls off the boat 
on his way home, or if he's hit by  

1124
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:21,280
lightning after he returns - then I will 
blame some of the people in this room.

1125
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:24,720
That, I will not forgive.

1126
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:34,120
But if my son is permitted to return safely to 
New York, then I promise, I will not be the one to  

1127
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:43,240
break the peace we have made here today.' At this, 
he stood up and opened his arms to Tattaglia.

1128
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:48,480
Tattaglia stood up too, and the 
two men walked around the table.

1129
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:53,080
They met behind Barzini's chair 
and hugged each other warmly.

1130
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:58,760
Then all the Godfathers in the room stood 
up and began to hug and kiss each other,  

1131
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:05,320
congratulating each other on 
the end of the war.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1132
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,080
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1133
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:10,360
Ghost from the Past

1134
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:14,360
One autumn afternoon, as Kay was walking home,  

1135
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:20,040
she saw a large black car parked outside 
the school where she was a teacher.

1136
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:28,280
Next to the car, there was a serious-looking man 
in a black hat and long black coat, watching her.

1137
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:32,640
Kay stopped as if she had seen a ghost.

1138
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,400
'Michael,' she said.

1139
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,240
'How long have you been back?'

1140
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:41,640
'About a year,' he said quietly.

1141
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:47,560
Then, walking slowly towards her, 
he said: 'It's good to see you Kay'

1142
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,880
They walked together through 
the park, hands in pockets,  

1143
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,440
a little shy with each other after so much time.

1144
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,400
'I'm working for my father 
now,' Michael explained.

1145
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,200
'He's been sick.

1146
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,240
Very sick.'

1147
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:06,880
'But you're not like him,' Kay replied.

1148
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,000
'I thought you weren't going to 
become a man like your father.'

1149
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,320
'As I've grown older, I've 
learnt to respect him more.

1150
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:20,240
He's just an ordinary man who 
loves his family, that's all.'

1151
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:24,640
'Ordinary men don't have 
other men killed,' Kay said.

1152
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:30,000
'Listen, Kay,' Michael stopped 
walking and looked her in the eyes.

1153
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,800
'In five years' time, my family 
will have no more problems.

1154
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,200
We'll be a lawful, respectable family.

1155
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,640
Trust me.

1156
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:43,240
That's all I can tell you about my business.'

1157
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:46,240
Kay's eyes filled with tears.

1158
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:49,560
'Michael, why did you come here?' she said.

1159
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:54,000
'What do you want with me after 
all this time? You didn't call.

1160
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,240
You didn't write ...'

1161
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,760
'I came here because I need you.

1162
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,480
I care for you.'

1163
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,360
'Please stop it.'

1164
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:09,640
But Michael went on: 'Because I want 
you to marry me.' Kay shook her head.

1165
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,680
'It's too late.'

1166
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:18,080
'I promise I'll do anything you ask,' 
Michael continued in a soft, calm voice.

1167
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,840
'Let's forget the last two years.

1168
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,760
What's important is that we have each other.

1169
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,880
That we have children.

1170
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,640
Kay, I need you.

1171
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,720
And I love you.'

1172
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:34,040
As Michael was speaking, Kay kept looking away.

1173
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,600
She didn't know what to say.

1174
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,560
Michael had changed.

1175
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,600
He was different now.

1176
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:44,880
There was something cold 
about him, something hard...

1177
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,360
But in the end, this didn't matter.

1178
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:53,760
Before she could answer him, the large 
black car drove up and stopped next to them.

1179
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,680
Michael opened the back door for her and waited.

1180
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:02,000
In her heart, Kay realized 
that she still loved him.

1181
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:09,040
Without a word, she stepped 
inside the car.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1182
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,920
CHAPTER TWELVE

1183
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,320
Many Changes

1184
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:17,680
As months turned into years, 
there were many changes.

1185
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:21,360
Michael and Kay got married and had two children.

1186
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:25,920
Connie and Carlo Rizzi moved with their 
children into a house on Long Island,  

1187
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,600
to be near the rest of the family.

1188
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,960
Fredo was sent to Las Vegas,  

1189
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:36,560
where the Corleones had bought one hotel 
and were planning to buy many more.

1190
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:41,080
Barzini was taking advantage of the 
peace between the five families,  

1191
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:46,680
and was beginning to take over a lot of 
the Corleone family business in New York.

1192
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:52,160
Tessio and Clemenza wanted to fight 
Barzini before he became too strong,  

1193
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:57,160
but Michael, who had spent long hours 
talking to Tom Hagen and his father,  

1194
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:01,560
learning the family business, 
told them to be patient.

1195
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:06,760
At first, Tessio and Clemenza didn't 
like taking orders from Michael.

1196
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:10,160
They tried to talk to Don Corleone instead.

1197
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:14,520
But the old man said: 'Do you trust me?'

1198
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:19,040
'Yes, Godfather,' Tessio and Clemenza replied.

1199
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:24,520
'Then be a friend to Michael 
He's head of the family now.

1200
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,560
Do as he says'

1201
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:30,640
One afternoon, Michael sat in the garden with  

1202
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:37,400
his father Don Corleone had put on a 
lot of weight and moved very slowly.

1203
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:41,680
He spent most of his time in the 
garden, looking after his plants,  

1204
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:47,240
or just sitting under a tree, drinking 
wine, thinking about the past.

1205
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:54,200
But his mind was still sharp Michael 
always came to him for advice.

1206
01:27:54,200 --> 01:28:01,320
'Be careful of Barzini,' he told 
Michael 'He'll move against you first.

1207
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:05,200
He'll arrange a meeting 
with someone that you trust.

1208
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,640
He'll promise you safety.

1209
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:11,880
But at that meeting, he'll kill you'.

1210
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:18,360
Don Corleone drank some red wine, and 
suddenly changed the subject 'Are you  

1211
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:22,640
happy with your wife and children?' he asked.

1212
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:26,400
'Very happy,' Michael said softly.

1213
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,280
He wanted to hear more about Barzini,  

1214
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:33,960
but he respected and loved his 
father too much to hurry him.

1215
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,680
'That's good,' said Don Corleone.

1216
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:43,760
He looked around the garden for a moment 
with a sad look in his eyes, then said:

1217
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:48,440
'I'm sorry I can't stop thinking about Barzini.

1218
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,840
It worries me.

1219
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:54,040
I always thought Sonny 
would be head of the family.

1220
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,480
I never wanted this for you.

1221
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:00,640
There just wasn't enough time.

1222
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:04,040
Michael gently touched his father's arm.

1223
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,920
'Don't worry, Father,' he said.

1224
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:09,120
'I'll take care of it.'

1225
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:14,120
Don Corleone nodded, smiled to 
himself, then looked suddenly  

1226
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:19,360
serious as if he had forgotten to 
tell Michael something important.

1227
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,760
'What's the matter, Father?' Michael asked.

1228
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:27,440
'Listen,' Don Corleone raised one finger.

1229
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:33,680
'Whoever comes to you with this 
Barzini meeting - he's the traitor.

1230
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,880
Don't forget that'.

1231
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:39,440
Then, standing with great difficulty, he touched  

1232
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:46,720
Michael lovingly on the cheek and walked 
slowly back to the house, out of the sun.

1233
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,880
One Sunday morning, while 
the women were at church,  

1234
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:55,480
Don Corleone was playing with his grandson 
among his tomato plants in the garden.

1235
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:59,000
As he tried to run away from the 
little boy who was chasing him,  

1236
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,800
he suddenly found it hard to breathe.

1237
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:06,320
It was as if the sun had come 
down very close to his head.

1238
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:11,840
He stopped running and started to cough 
as he tried to get air into his chest.

1239
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,040
The little boy laughed, thinking 
this was part of the game.

1240
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:22,920
Don Corleone bent forward, coughing 
more and more, and then he felt it:  

1241
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:27,040
an explosion of fire inside his chest.

1242
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:34,080
With a cry of pain, he fell back 
among his tomato plants, dead.

1243
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,520
All his life, people had tried to kill him.

1244
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:44,960
They had failed In the end, Don 
Vito Corleone died a natural death,  

1245
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:53,000
playing with his grandson in his garden 
on a peaceful Sunday morning.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1246
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,920
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1247
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,880
Traitor

1248
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:03,320
At the funeral, Michael sat with his family 
as people walked past, one by one, throwing  

1249
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:13,000
flowers on to his father's grave Michael studied 
their faces carefully Clemenza, Tessio, Enzo the  

1250
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:21,560
butcher, Johnny Fontane, all the people that his 
father had helped in his long and dangerous life.

1251
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,920
Some of his enemies were at the funeral too.

1252
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:30,200
Barzini threw a red rose on to the 
grave, and lowered his eyes respectfully  

1253
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:37,080
in Michael's direction Michael stared at 
him coldly as he turned and walked away.

1254
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:43,240
A few minutes later, Tessio walked up to 
Michael and whispered something in his ear  

1255
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:49,520
Michael stood up and walked away from the 
grave to hear what Tessio wanted to say.

1256
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:59,080
'Barzini wants to arrange a meeting,' Tessio 
said 'He says we can solve all our problems'

1257
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,080
'Did you talk to him?'

1258
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:04,160
'Yes I can arrange everything.

1259
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,520
Trust me'

1260
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:11,440
Michael looked at Tessio He 
had known him all his life.

1261
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,960
He had always been like an uncle 
to him But Michael remembered his  

1262
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:21,560
father's words - 'Whoever comes 
to you with this Barzini meeting,  

1263
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:27,600
he's the traitor' - and he felt 
a great sadness in his heart.

1264
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:34,560
'All right,' Michael said quietly, and he 
returned to his seat by his father's grave.

1265
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:39,640
He told Tom, who was sitting next to 
him, about his conversation with Tessio.

1266
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:46,680
Tom shook his head sadly 'I always 
thought it would be Clemenza,' he said.

1267
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:55,320
'No,' said Michael 'This is a clever 
move, and Tessio's cleverer than Clemenza.

1268
01:32:55,320 --> 01:33:00,800
But I'm going to wait I've decided 
to be godfather to Connie's baby,  

1269
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:07,240
and then I'm going to meet Barzini, Tattaglia 
and all the heads of the five families'

1270
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:14,120
He watched Tessio who was standing some distance 
away, shaking hands and talking with Barzini.

1271
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:20,440
He hadn't told Tom the whole truth 
Tom was not a Consigliori anymore,  

1272
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:23,760
so he didn't know everything 
in the way that he used to.

1273
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:30,680
The truth was that Michael had already 
decided to kill all his enemies.

1274
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:39,440
They were going to die on the day he stood 
as godfather to Connie's child.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1275
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,560
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1276
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:45,360
Michael Rizzi, Go in Peace

1277
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:51,680
As Michael walked into the church with Kay, 
Connie, Carlo and the rest of the family,  

1278
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:57,320
his men were all over New York, 
getting ready to kill his enemies.

1279
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:04,440
Pete Clemenza kissed his wife goodbye and left the 
house carrying a large flower-box under his arm.

1280
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:10,800
Michael's personal bodyguard, Albert Neri, 
was putting on a policeman's uniform.

1281
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,040
Clemenza's close friend, Rocco Lampone,  

1282
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:19,840
was sitting with his eyes closed in a 
large hotel, while a man gave him a shave.

1283
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:24,960
Two other men who worked for the family 
were checking their machine-guns in a small,  

1284
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:29,600
apartment room somewhere in 
a cheap part of the city.

1285
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:34,160
Kay stood in the church, Connie's 
baby sleeping in her arms.

1286
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:39,160
The priest spoke Latin and touched the 
baby's cheeks and mouth with water.

1287
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:43,720
Then he asked Michael: 'Do 
you believe in God the Father,  

1288
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:52,120
the Maker of Heaven and Earth? Do you believe 
in Jesus Christ?' Michael said: 'I do.'

1289
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:57,760
Albert Neri was standing on the pavement in 
his policeman's uniform He was talking to the  

1290
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:01,800
driver of a car which was parked 
in front of the Plaza Building,  

1291
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:08,160
trying to make him move away The driver 
shook his head and refused to move.

1292
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:15,280
Pete Clemenza was running up a lot of stairs 
in a dark hotel, the flower-box under his arm.

1293
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:21,160
His fat face was hot and red, 
and he was very short of breath.

1294
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,640
Rocco Lampone checked his face in the mirror,  

1295
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:30,640
paid the man in the hotel who had given him 
the shave, and calmly walked out of the door.

1296
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:33,920
The two men with machine-guns 
looked at each other and,  

1297
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:38,200
without a word, walked out of their apartment.

1298
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:42,000
The baby in Kay's arms woke up and began to cry.

1299
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,040
He didn't like the water on his face.

1300
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:51,800
Barzini appeared at the top of the steps 
of the Plaza Building with his bodyguard.

1301
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:56,960
Looking down, he saw his driver arguing 
with a policeman on the pavement,  

1302
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:01,680
so he sent his bodyguard down to 
find out what the problem was.

1303
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:07,760
Rocco Lampone waited near the desk in the 
hotel entrance, and smoked a cigarette.

1304
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,360
Pete Clemenza reached the top of the stairs and  

1305
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:16,760
rested against a wall outside a 
lift, completely out of breath.

1306
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:21,800
'Michael Francis Rizzi,' the 
priest spoke to the crying baby.

1307
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:26,960
'Do you refuse Satan, and 
everything that Satan does?'

1308
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,920
Clemenza waited outside the lift.

1309
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:35,280
Suddenly, the doors opened and a 
small, thin man with silver hair,  

1310
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:40,360
a red flower in the buttonhole of 
his expensive suit, stepped out.

1311
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:43,760
It was Cuneo, one of the New York Godfathers  

1312
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:48,240
who had been at the meeting with 
Don Corleone three years before.

1313
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:55,480
He stopped when he saw Clemenza, a look of 
confusion on his face Clemenza lifted his short,  

1314
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:59,600
fat leg and kicked Cuneo hard in the stomach.

1315
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,440
Cuneo fell backwards into the lift.

1316
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:07,680
Clemenza quickly opened his flower-box 
and took out a large shotgun.

1317
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:11,960
He pointed it at Cuneo and fired.

1318
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:18,520
'I do refuse Satan,' Michael spoke quietly 
to the priest, answering for the baby.

1319
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:23,520
'And everything that Satan 
does.' The baby went on crying.

1320
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:29,640
A man in a white suit walked past the 
desk where Rocco Lampone was waiting.

1321
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:32,640
He was on his way out of the hotel.

1322
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:37,160
This was Stracci, another New York Godfather.

1323
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:40,040
As he was half-way through the revolving doors,  

1324
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:44,920
Lampone ran from the desk and 
locked the door to stop it turning.

1325
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:47,600
Stracci was caught inside.

1326
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:51,240
He tried to push, but the doors wouldn't move.

1327
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,760
He hit the glass with his hands.

1328
01:37:53,760 --> 01:38:00,400
He turned round and found himself face to 
face with the end of Rocco Lampone's gun.

1329
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:06,040
He put his hands up and pressed himself 
against the door behind him Rocco fired  

1330
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:13,160
and the bullets crashed through the glass 
of the door straight into Stracci's heart.

1331
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:18,120
Philip Tattaglia had left his bodyguards 
outside in the street while he had a  

1332
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:23,720
secret meeting with his girlfriend in a 
small room in a cheap part of New York.

1333
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:27,000
This was his last mistake.

1334
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:33,280
As he was kissing her, the door burst open 
and two men with machine-guns rushed in.

1335
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:38,760
As Tattaglia looked around for his gun, 
the girl jumped to her feet and screamed.

1336
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:45,120
The gunmen opened fire and Tattaglia and 
the girl fell back in a shower of bullets.

1337
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:50,880
Then the gunmen left as suddenly as 
they had appeared, leaving behind them  

1338
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:58,560
a smoke-filled room and two dead bodies 
in a pile of torn and bloody bedclothes.

1339
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,520
The priest held a silver 
spoon above the baby's head,  

1340
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,480
and let drops of water fall on to the baby's face.

1341
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:12,860
'In Nomine Patris, et Filii, et 
Spintus Sancti,' the priest said...

1342
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:13,520
...

1343
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:19,160
Barzini's bodyguard ran down the steps of the 
Plaza Building and called to the policeman,  

1344
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:21,880
who was writing something in his notebook.

1345
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:28,360
The policeman put away his notebook, took 
out his handgun and shot the bodyguard dead.

1346
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:34,120
The driver of the car put up his hands but 
there was no pity in Albert Neri's heart.

1347
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:36,480
He killed him too.

1348
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:39,760
Barzini, who was halfway down the steps,  

1349
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:44,200
turned and began to walk quickly 
back up towards the building.

1350
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,280
He was a proud man.

1351
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:53,040
He never liked to run too fast for anything, 
not even when his life was in danger.

1352
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:57,320
This gave Neri the time that he 
needed to go down on one knee,  

1353
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:03,320
point his gun carefully up at Barzini, 
and shoot him three times in the back.

1354
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:10,080
Barzini stopped, as if in surprise, 
then fell backwards down the steps.

1355
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:14,560
Suddenly, inside the church, 
the baby stopped crying.

1356
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:18,640
'Michael Rizzi, go in peace,' the priest said.

1357
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:21,160
'And God go with you always.

1358
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:23,400
Amen.'

1359
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:27,080
'Amen,' Michael Corleone said softly,  

1360
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:37,560
and lowered his eyes knowing that, 
by now, all his enemies were dead.

1361
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,440
CHAPTER FIVETEEN

1362
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,640
Family Business

1363
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:47,920
As the family stood on the steps outside the 
church, Carlo Rizzi shook Michael's hand.

1364
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:53,240
'Thank you, Godfather, thank you,' he kept 
saying, tears of happiness in his eyes.

1365
01:40:54,640 --> 01:41:02,360
'I was pleased to do it,' Michael said, then 
added, without smiling, 'Now, Carlo, could you go  

1366
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:08,880
and wait for me in the house? I'm afraid we can't 
go with our families to visit Las Vegas today.

1367
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,960
We'll have to wait here for a couple of days.

1368
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:16,960
You can join Connie and your children then, OK?'

1369
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,360
'OK,' Carlo said.

1370
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:22,640
He knew better than to show he was unhappy.

1371
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:25,040
Michael had been very good to him.

1372
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:30,040
He had welcomed him into the family, 
he had been godfather to his son.

1373
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:33,040
He did whatever Michael wanted him to do.

1374
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,360
He never argued.

1375
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:39,440
When Carlo had gone, Michael 
kissed his wife and his sister,  

1376
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:42,560
and left them on the steps outside the church.

1377
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:46,320
He had more business to take care of.

1378
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:51,840
Tessio was ringing Barzini's office from 
the wall-phone in Tom Hagen's kitchen,  

1379
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:56,200
not knowing that Barzini was already dead.

1380
01:41:56,200 --> 01:42:01,720
'Tell Barzini we're on our 
way to Brooklyn,' he said.

1381
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:04,880
After the call, he turned to 
Tom, who was waiting for him,  

1382
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:11,360
and said: 'I hope Mike gets what 
he wants from the meeting tonight.'

1383
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:15,400
'I'm sure he will,' Tom nodded seriously.

1384
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:18,240
He followed Tessio out of the house.

1385
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:23,160
They were half-way across the street to Michael's 
house when they were stopped by a bodyguard.

1386
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:28,520
'The boss says he'll come in 
another car,' the man said.

1387
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:31,680
'He says you two can go before him.'

1388
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,920
Tessio looked worried.

1389
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:38,240
'He can't do that,' he said, turning to Tom.

1390
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:41,720
'That spoils all my arrangements.'

1391
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:46,160
Three more bodyguards appeared 
from nowhere and stood around him.

1392
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:56,360
Then Tom said gently: 'I can't go with you either, 
Tessio.' Tessio understood everything immediately.

1393
01:42:56,360 --> 01:43:00,880
He knew that he was going to die 
for trying to betray Michael.

1394
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,800
He looked at Tom sadly and said:

1395
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:07,760
'Tell Mike it was only business.

1396
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,280
I always liked him.'

1397
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:13,760
'He understands that,' Hagen nodded.

1398
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,320
Tessio paused for a second.

1399
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:19,320
He was a brave man, but he couldn't stop himself  

1400
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:23,120
from showing Tom a moment 
of plain, human weakness.

1401
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:27,800
'Tom, can you help me?' he asked.

1402
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:30,200
'As a friend?'

1403
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:33,000
Tom shook his head and looked away.

1404
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,960
He didn't want to show his 
feelings, but inside he felt sick.

1405
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:44,080
Tessio had always been the best 
soldier in the Corleone family.

1406
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:50,840
'I'm sorry, Tessio, I can't do 
that,' he said, and walked away.'

1407
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:54,800
Tom watched from his window as the 
four bodyguards led Tessio towards  

1408
01:43:54,800 --> 01:44:04,160
a waiting car and drove him away for his 
meeting, not with Barzini, but with death.

1409
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:10,800
Carlo Rizzi was sitting in his front room, making 
a phone-call, when something made him turn round.

1410
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,080
Michael was watching him from the doorway.

1411
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:18,760
Tom Hagen and a bodyguard were 
standing quietly behind him.

1412
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:25,480
Carlo saw the icy look in Michael's 
eyes, and he felt his whole body go weak.

1413
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:31,600
'Carlo, you have to answer 
for Sonny,' Michael said.

1414
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,520
Carlo didn't answer.

1415
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:37,320
He stood up, pretending not to understand.

1416
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:42,920
'You betrayed Sonny,' Michael 
continued in a cold, flat voice.

1417
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:48,040
'Did you really think you could 
fool a Corleone? You played a game,  

1418
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:53,080
didn't you? You made Sonny 
angry by hitting your own wife.

1419
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:56,360
You knew that he'd come to help her.'

1420
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:59,160
Carlo began to shake with fear.

1421
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:03,240
'I promise you, on my son's life, I'm innocent.

1422
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:07,160
Mike, don't do this to me, please!'

1423
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:10,840
But Michael calmly made him sit down next to him.

1424
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:17,680
'Barzini's dead,' he said quietly, not 
taking his eyes off Carlo's frightened face.

1425
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:20,240
'Philip Tattaglia's dead too.

1426
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:24,560
Cuneo, Stracci, they're all gone.

1427
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,680
Today, I'm taking care of all family business.

1428
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:30,800
So don't tell me you're innocent.

1429
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,280
Don't lie to me.'

1430
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:37,440
Carlo started to cry, but he didn't say anything.

1431
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:43,280
Tom Hagen gave him a drink, and Michael 
put a brotherly arm around his shoulder.

1432
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,960
'Don't be afraid,' he said.

1433
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:47,880
'I'm not going to kill you.

1434
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:49,760
You're my sister's husband.

1435
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,040
I'm your son's godfather.

1436
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:52,920
No.

1437
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:56,800
I'm going to throw you out of the family business.

1438
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:00,680
I'm putting you on a plane to 
Las Vegas to join your family.

1439
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:03,000
I want you to stay there.

1440
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,800
That's going to be your punishment.

1441
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:11,600
Now please, don't tell me you're innocent, 
because that insults my intelligence.

1442
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:14,120
It makes me very angry.

1443
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:15,840
Tell me what happened.

1444
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:19,440
Who killed Sonny? Barzini or Tattaglia?'

1445
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:26,280
Carlo stopped crying and looked 
up with a sudden feeling of hope.

1446
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:29,440
He saw Michael's eyes close to his.

1447
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:32,400
They looked warm and full of forgiveness.

1448
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:37,960
He swallowed the rest of his drink and smiled 
at Michael with a grateful look in his eyes.

1449
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:42,240
'It was Barzini,' he said quietly.

1450
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:43,720
'Good.

1451
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:47,640
Good,' Michael said, nodding to himself.

1452
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:50,920
He stood up and turned towards the window.

1453
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:54,360
'There's a car waiting for you outside,' he said.

1454
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:56,760
'It'll take you to the airport.

1455
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:59,840
I'll call Connie to tell her you're coming.'

1456
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,360
Carlo stood up and tried to speak.

1457
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:04,200
'Michael, please...'

1458
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:08,720
But Michael turned on him angrily, 
his eyes cold and hard again.

1459
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:11,880
'Get out of here,' he said.

1460
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:16,360
'I never want to see you again.'

1461
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:22,280
When Carlo left the house, he saw two men 
putting suitcases into the back of his car.

1462
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:26,760
He got into the passenger seat and 
waited for someone to drive him away.

1463
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:32,400
He didn't see Pete Clemenza sitting 
quietly behind him in the back seat.

1464
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:36,280
'Hello, Carlo,' Clemenza said.

1465
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,640
Before Carlo could turn round,  

1466
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:43,840
Clemenza threw a smooth thin cord 
around Carlo's neck and pulled hard.

1467
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,680
Carlo fought and tried to escape.

1468
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:50,480
His body jumped around like 
a fish on the end of a line.

1469
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:56,280
His foot crashed through the front window of 
the car, but Clemenza was too strong for him.

1470
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:00,080
He pulled the cord until 
it cut into Carlo's throat.

1471
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:04,520
A minute later, Carlo Rizzi was dead.

1472
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:11,520
Michael, who had watched it all from the front 
of the house, turned away, followed by Tom Hagen.

1473
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:15,800
He had taken care of all the 
family business in one day.

1474
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:20,720
The Corleones were now the 
strongest family in New York.

1475
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,760
He had reason to feel proud.

1476
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:29,800
When Connie heard that her husband was 
dead, she flew back at once to see Michael.

1477
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:33,000
She ran straight into his 
office and screamed at him:

1478
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,200
'You killed my husband!

1479
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:39,440
You waited until Papa died 
and then you killed him!

1480
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,120
You blamed him for Sonny.

1481
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:42,400
You always did.

1482
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:43,680
Everybody did.

1483
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:45,600
You never thought about me!

1484
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:48,280
What am I going to do?'

1485
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:51,040
Michael sat quietly at his desk.

1486
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:57,800
Kay tried to calm Connie down, but Connie pushed 
her away, ran around the desk and started to kick  

1487
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:04,840
and hit her brother, crying and screaming the 
whole time.' You stood godfather to our baby!

1488
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:06,720
You cold-hearted killer!

1489
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,840
You animal!

1490
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,080
You ...!'

1491
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:11,680
Michael didn't try to move away.

1492
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:14,800
He let Connie scream at him and hit him.

1493
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:22,080
Finally, she was taken away into another room, 
and Michael was left alone with Kay in the office.

1494
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:27,800
He walked around the room, feeling uncomfortable 
at the strange look Kay was giving him.

1495
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,680
She was shocked by what had happened.

1496
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:34,000
She was also a little afraid.

1497
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,200
'She's gone crazy,' Michael tried to explain.

1498
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:40,240
'Understandable, I guess.'

1499
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:43,440
Kay could hear Connie 
screaming from the next room.

1500
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:46,720
She looked her husband in the eye and said:

1501
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:49,440
'Michael, is it true?'

1502
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:55,040
'Don't ask me about my business, Kay,' he replied.

1503
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:58,120
'Is it true?' she repeated.

1504
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:00,720
Michael repeated his reply.

1505
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:05,960
When she asked him for the third time, 
he crashed his hand down on to the desk.

1506
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:08,720
'Enough!' he shouted.

1507
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:11,760
Kay lowered her eyes and bit her lip.

1508
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:14,080
Finally, Michael said:

1509
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,440
'All right.

1510
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:17,200
This one time.

1511
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:20,880
I'll let you ask me about my business.'

1512
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:24,480
'Is it true?' she whispered.

1513
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:26,480
Michael looked at Kay.

1514
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,080
He stood completely still.

1515
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:32,600
Then he shook his head and softly answered:

1516
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:34,280
'No.'

1517
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:38,120
Kay was so happy that she almost started crying.

1518
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:41,120
She ran up to her husband and hugged him.

1519
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:44,320
A few minutes later, she 
moved back and looked at him.

1520
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:48,480
'I guess we both need a 
drink,' she tried to laugh.

1521
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,960
She left the office to get a drink.

1522
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:54,600
She was about to take the two 
glasses back into the room when  

1523
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:58,800
she saw several men entering 
the office from another door.

1524
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,880
One of them was Pete Clemenza, the funny little  

1525
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:06,920
fat man she had first seen dancing at 
Connie's wedding many years before.

1526
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:10,520
She watched in silence as he lowered his head,  

1527
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:19,000
kissed Michael's hand and said, in a 
deep, respectful voice: 'Don Corleone.'

1528
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:25,240
Then someone gently closed the door, 
and Kay was left outside, alone.

1529
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:52,520
Her new life as the Godfather's 
wife had only just begun.
