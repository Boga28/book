00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,160
The Gift of the Magi

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,920
One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all.  

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,760
Della counted it three times. She was very careful 
with money and bought only the cheapest food. But  

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,840
she only had one dollar and eighty-seven 
cents. And the next day was Christmas.

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,080
There was nothing to do so she sat down and 
cried. Della lived in New York City in a poor,  

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,640
little apartment. The rent was $8 a week. The 
name on the front door of their flat was "Mr  

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,720
James Dillingham Young". In the past he earned 
$30 a week, but now he earned only $20 a week.  

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,560
When he came home after work Della always 
hugged him. And this was very good.

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,680
Della stopped crying and dried her face.  

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,640
She stood by the window and looked 
at a gray cat on the gray street.

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,040
"Tomorrow will be Christmas Day and I have 
only one dollar and eighty-seven cents  

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,120
to buy Jim a Christmas present," she thought. She 
wanted to buy him something fine and beautiful.  

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,400
She wanted to show him that she loved him a lot.

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,840
There was a small mirror on the 
wall and Della stood in front of it.  

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,400
Her eyes were bright. She pulled down her 
beautiful long hair. It went below her knees.

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,560
Now, the James Dillingham Youngs 
had two very special things.  

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,400
One was Jim's gold pocket watch. It 
belonged to his father and before that,  

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,480
to his grandfather. The other 
special thing was Della's hair.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,560
She put up her hair again. A tear or two 
fell on the old red carpet. Then she put  

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,640
on her old brown coat and her old brown hat and 
quickly went out with her eyes still shining.

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,920
She stopped in front of a door with a sign:  

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,040
Madame Sofronie, Hair Goods. Della 
opened the door and saw a big woman.

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,080
"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della.

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,640
"I buy hair," said Madame Sofronie. "Take 
your hat off and show me your hair."

25
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
Della's beautiful brown hair fell down.

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,800
"Twenty dollars," said Madame Sofronie and she 
touched the long hair with her expert hand.

27
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
"Cut it off, quickly! And give 
me the money," said Della.

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,960
During the next two hours Della went to 
many stores and looked for Jim's present.

29
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,960
She found it at last. It was 
perfect for Jim: a simple gold  

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,240
chain for his pocket watch. He was proud 
of his pocket watch but it had no chain.

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,240
The gold chain cost twenty-one dollars, 
and Della hurried home happily with it  

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,840
and the eighty-seven cents. When she got home 
she looked at her very short hair in the mirror.

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,200
"Oh dear, what can I do 
with my hair?" she thought.

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,680
She was very busy with her hair for the next 
forty minutes. Then she looked in the mirror  

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,320
again. She looked like a schoolboy 
with tiny curls all over her head.

36
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,760
What's Jim going to say when he sees me?"  

37
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,960
she thought. "But what could I do with 
one dollar and eighty-seven cents?"

38
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,400
At seven o'clock the coffee was ready 
and the frying pan was on the stove.

39
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Jim was never late. Della had 
the gold chain in her hand  

40
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,160
and she waited for him near the door. 
Then she heard his footsteps on the stairs  

41
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,880
and she was afraid for a moment. "I hope 
Jim still thinks I'm pretty," she thought.

42
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,520
The door opened and Jim came in. He was 
thin and serious. He needed a new overcoat  

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:04,640
and he had no gloves. Poor fellow, he was only 
twenty-two years old and he already had a family.

44
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,000
His eyes were fixed on Della. She could not 
understand the look on his face. He was not  

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,200
angry or surprised. He simply looked at her with a 
strange expression on his face. Della ran to him.

46
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,040
"Jim, darling," she cried. "Don't 
look at me that way. I sold my hair  

47
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:33,120
because I wanted to give you a present. My hair 
will be long again, it grows quickly. Oh, Jim,  

48
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,720
say 'Merry Christmas' and let's be 
happy! I have a beautiful gift for you."

49
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,280
"Did you cut off your hair?" asked Jim slowly.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,360
"Yes, I cut it off and sold it," said Della. 
"Don't you like me anymore? I'm still Della!"

51
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,440
Jim looked around the room.

52
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,120
"You cut your hair?" Jim 
said again, almost stupidly.

53
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,320
"Yes, I sold it because I love you so 
much, Jim. Shall I get dinner ready now?"

54
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,320
Jim put his arms around Della. Then he 
took a package from his overcoat pocket  

55
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,440
and threw it on the table.

56
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,400
"Don't worry about me, Della," he said. "I 
will always love you. It doesn't matter if  

57
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,280
your hair is short or long. But if you open the 
package, you'll see why I was strange before."

58
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,880
Della was excited and she 
quickly opened the package.  

59
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,120
She gave a little scream of happiness, 
but then she started crying.

60
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,560
There were The Combs-two beautiful, 
tortoise-shell combs with little jewels.  

61
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,520
They were the perfect color for 
her hair. When Della saw them  

62
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,960
the first time in a store window 
on Broadway, she wanted them.  

63
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,240
She knew they were expensive combs and now they 
were hers. But she did not have long hair anymore!

64
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,480
Della held The Combs in her 
hand and looked at them.  

65
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,240
She smiled lovingly at Jim and said, 
"My hair grows very fast, Jim!"

66
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,360
Then Della jumped up like 
a cat and cried, "Oh, oh!"

67
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,600
She showed Jim his beautiful gift.

68
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,080
"Isn't it splendid, Jim? I looked everywhere 
to find it. Now you'll look at your watch a  

69
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,280
hundred times a day. Give me your watch! 
Let's see how it looks on the new chain."

70
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Jim sat down and put his hands 
behind his head and smiled.

71
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,760
"Della," he said, "Let's put 
our Christmas presents away and  

72
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,040
keep them a while. They're too nice to use now.  

73
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:47,840
I sold my watch to get the money to buy you 
The Combs. And now, let's have dinner."
 
 
 
 

74
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,373
- THE END -
