00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,750
CHAPTER ONE
Earth's Crust

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,690
Earth is round, like an orange.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,850
Oranges have a skin and Earth has a skin,
too.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,530
We call this skin Earth's crust.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,520
Under the crust, there is very hot rock.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,460
Earth's crust has different pieces.

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,180
These pieces move very, very slowly.

8
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,870
Millions of years ago, the pieces moved and
made mountains.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:47,550
Under mountains, the crust is thick, but under
the ocean, it's thinner.

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:54,559
When two pieces of the crust move and meet,
there can be earthquakes.

11
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,889
A volcano is a hole in Earth's crust.

12
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:07,900
When a volcano erupts, hot rock flies out
from under the ground, and melted rock pours

13
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,159
out over the ground.

14
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,590
Volcanoes under the ocean sometimes make new
islands.

15
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:25,869
In 1963, a volcano in the Atlantic Ocean made
a new island called Surtsey.

16
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:31,540
There are many different rocks in Earth's
crust.

17
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,560
They are millions of years old.

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,580
The rocks are often different colors.

19
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:48,170
In the Painted Desert in Arizona in the USA,
you can see the different rocks.

20
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,689
CHAPTER TWO
Oceans

21
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:57,009
On Earth, there is more ocean than land.

22
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,880
The Pacific Ocean is the biggest ocean.

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,859
It's bigger than Africa!

24
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:09,979
Did you know that there are mountains and
valleys under the ocean?

25
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:16,099
Some of these mountains are bigger than the
biggest mountains on land.

26
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,459
In the deepest parts of the ocean, the water
is 10 kilometers deep.

27
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:28,340
The water in the ocean is always moving.

28
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,890
Waves hit the land and break the rocks.

29
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,120
Sometimes, big pieces of rock fall into the
ocean.

30
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:46,230
They leave big cliffs, like the beautiful
Uluwatu Cliffs in Bali in Indonesia.

31
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,130
Where the ocean is warm, we sometimes find
coral.

32
00:02:52,130 --> 00:03:00,879
Coral is made of millions of very small animals
that make hard covers around themselves.

33
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,790
When the animals die, the hard covers make
the coral reef.

34
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:15,400
The Great Barrier Reef near Australia is the
biggest coral reef in the world.

35
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,209
It's 2,600 kilometers long.

36
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:31,010
Sea turtles, dolphins, and many other amazing
animals live there.

37
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:37,620
In some places, where the coral reef is very
big, it comes out of the water.

38
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,860
It makes a small island.

39
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,610
CHAPTER THREE
Rivers and Waterfalls

40
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,520
Rivers usually begin as streams in mountains.

41
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,800
The water comes from rain or snow.

42
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,269
All rivers then go to the ocean.

43
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,939
Big rivers are very strong.

44
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:11,890
When the ground under a river is soft, the
river makes valleys.

45
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:19,420
When the ground under it is hard rock, there
are waterfalls or rapids.

46
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:27,610
One incredible waterfall is the Iguazu Falls
between Argentina and Brazil.

47
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:36,300
Iguazu means 'big water' in an old language
of South America.

48
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:43,450
There's more water in the River Amazon than
in any other river in the world.

49
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,270
It begins in the mountains in Peru and Ecuador.

50
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:55,360
Then it goes through the rainforest in Brazil,
and to the Atlantic Ocean.

51
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,280
There are no bridges on the Amazon.

52
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,600
First, the river goes through rainforest and
there are no roads.

53
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:13,120
Then, near the ocean, the river is very wide
so people can't build bridges.

54
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,070
They cross the river by boat.

55
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:26,570
The Amazon is the home of one of the longest
snakes, called anacondas.

56
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:32,580
Some grow to 9 meters long.

57
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,210
CHAPTER FOUR
Glaciers and Icebergs

58
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:45,930
The coldest places on Earth are in the highest
mountains, and at the North and South Poles.

59
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,960
Here, there are rivers made of ice.

60
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,780
They are called glaciers.

61
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,350
Glaciers begin when snow falls.

62
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:04,520
Mountain glaciers move very, very slowly down
the mountain.

63
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,410
When the ice melts, the water goes into rivers.

64
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:15,640
It can take thousands of years for the water
from a glacier to get to the ocean.

65
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:23,740
At the North and South Poles, where the glaciers
are near the ocean, very big pieces of ice

66
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,720
break off.

67
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,380
These are called icebergs.

68
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,340
Icebergs move slowly on the ocean.

69
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:41,120
Near the North Pole, Ilulissat is one of the
most incredible places on Earth - and one

70
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,210
of the coldest.

71
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,460
The glacier and icebergs here are very, very
big.

72
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:56,470
The glacier is about 40 kilometers long and
it moves slowly to the Arctic Ocean.

73
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:05,690
It moves about 30 meters every day.

74
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,150
Icebergs are dangerous for boats.

75
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:18,370
Most of the ice is under the water, so people
in boats can't see all the ice.

76
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,970
CHAPTER FIVE
Hot Water

77
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,700
Imagine you are in this park.

78
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:32,280
Suddenly, you hear a loud noise of water moving
very fast.

79
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,360
Then hot water and steam pour out of the ground.

80
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,000
You are looking at a geyser.

81
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,920
What makes a geyser?

82
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,460
When it rains or snows, the water goes into
the ground.

83
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,300
Deep under the ground, there is hot rock.

84
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,460
If rainwater touches a lot of hot rock, it
begins to boil.

85
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,880
Then there's a lot of steam.

86
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,740
Suddenly, the water can't stay under the ground.

87
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,780
It has to come out.

88
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:16,370
Geysers are very hot, so don't go near them!

89
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:24,380
These white cliffs look like they are made
of ice, but they are really made of rock.

90
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,810
Hot water came out of the ground and poured
down the mountain.

91
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:35,250
Then minerals in the water made these incredible
cliffs.

92
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,349
They look like waterfalls, but they never
move.

93
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:47,350
They are thousands of years old.

94
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:55,300
At the Jigokudani Monkey Park in Japan, hot
water from under the ground makes pools.

95
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:02,910
When the weather is cold, monkeys sit in the
warm water.

96
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,490
CHAPTER SIX
Mountains and Lakes

97
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:15,160
The biggest mountain chain in the world is
the Himalayas in Asia.

98
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:22,170
It began when two pieces of Earth's crust
met and moved up.

99
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:31,779
They began to move about 50 million years
ago - and they are moving now, very slowly.

100
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:38,500
The top of Mount Everest in the Himalayas
is the highest place on Earth - it's about

101
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,990
9 kilometers above the ocean.

102
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,959
Everest is very big and it's getting bigger.

103
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:55,389
The top of Everest goes up about 5 millimeters
every year, because Earth's crust is moving

104
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:59,550
all the time.

105
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,540
Near high mountains, there are often deep
lakes.

106
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,480
The deepest lake in the world is Lake Baikal
in Russia.

107
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,740
It's more than 1,600 meters deep.

108
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:20,020
Scientists are exploring the lake in small
submarines.

109
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:29,329
Lake Baikal began when pieces of Earth's crust
moved and made a deep hole.

110
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:34,980
Water from 330 rivers goes into Lake Baikal.

111
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:43,430
There's more water here than in all the Great
Lakes in North America!

112
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,839
CHAPTER SEVEN
Caves

113
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,440
Caves are incredible underground worlds.

114
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,010
Many people are interested in them.

115
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,050
What makes a cave?

116
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:04,819
Near the coast, ocean waves hit cliffs and
make holes.

117
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:11,830
In the mountains, the moving ice in a glacier
makes caves in the rock.

118
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:18,949
The most incredible caves are in soft rock
called limestone.

119
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:22,860
Rain falls on the limestone and makes holes.

120
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,320
Slowly, the holes grow bigger and make caves.

121
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,850
This takes thousands and thousands of years.

122
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:42,730
The Sarawak Chamber in Borneo is the biggest
cave in the world.

123
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,999
It's longer than ten big planes!

124
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:54,760
Caves are usually very wet because water comes
through the rock.

125
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:03,540
Slowly, the raindrops mix with minerals and
build incredible rock sculptures, called stalactites

126
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,060
and stalagmites.

127
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,240
Thousands of years ago, people lived in caves.

128
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,490
They didn't have books or paper, so they drew
pictures on the cave walls.

129
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:27,009
People drew this picture in a cave in France,
about 16,000 years ago.

130
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:31,379
CHAPTER EIGHT
Earthquakes and Tsunamis

131
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:41,060
Usually, Earth's crust moves very slowly - only
a few millimeters every year.

132
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:50,069
Sometimes, two pieces of the crust move suddenly
in different directions, and then there's

133
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,310
an earthquake.

134
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:59,009
Earthquakes are dangerous because buildings
sometimes fall down.

135
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:04,649
When there's an earthquake, people in buildings
go under a heavy table.

136
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:08,310
Or they stand between two rooms.

137
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:14,649
These are good ideas - they can help to keep
people safe.

138
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:18,100
There are earthquakes under the ocean, too.

139
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,759
Usually, they are small and not dangerous.

140
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:32,500
Sometimes an earthquake under the ocean makes
a giant wave called a tsunami.

141
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,959
Tsunamis can be very dangerous.

142
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,160
After a tsunami, there are often floods.

143
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,059
There's water everywhere.

144
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:48,750
Houses, cars, and trees are in the water.

145
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,470
The water isn't clean, so many people are
sick.

146
00:13:53,470 --> 00:14:00,550
In 2004, there was a very big tsunami in the
Indian Ocean.

147
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,170
Many people died.

148
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,820
CHAPTER NINE
Deserts

149
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:15,449
A desert is a dry place, with almost no rain.

150
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:20,040
About 20 percent (%) of the land on Earth
is desert.

151
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,940
What are deserts made of?

152
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:29,390
Some deserts are made of sand, and many deserts
are made of stones or rocks.

153
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:34,939
Deserts are usually hot, but not always.

154
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:38,689
Antarctica is a cold desert.

155
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:43,790
It doesn't rain often there, but there's lots
of ice.

156
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:50,279
The Sahara Desert in Africa is the biggest
hot desert on Earth.

157
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,950
It's bigger than Australia!

158
00:14:53,950 --> 00:15:04,100
The animals in the desert can live there because
they don't drink very often.

159
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,370
Camels can live for a week with no water.

160
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:14,760
In Bolivia in South America, there's a desert
made of salt.

161
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,540
It's called the Salar de Uyuni.

162
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:26,189
About 40,000 years ago, it was a saltwater
lake, but now the ground is hard and dry most

163
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:28,550
of the time.

164
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,759
Sometimes the ground looks like a big mirror.

165
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,579
Many people visit the Salar de Uyuni because
it's an incredible place.

166
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:44,820
There's even a hotel made of salt!

167
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,279
CHAPTER TEN
Erosion

168
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,740
Where are these rocks?

169
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,490
Are they on the moon?

170
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:58,740
No, they are in Cappadocia in Turkey.

171
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,009
They look like sculptures, but no one made
them.

172
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:07,319
Really, the windy weather made them.

173
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,459
These rocks are not very hard.

174
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:16,100
The wind blows on them and very slowly changes
them.

175
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:22,269
When the weather changes Earth in this way,
we call it erosion.

176
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:30,420
In the Colorado River in the USA, erosion
began about 20 million years ago.

177
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,320
The river moved over the rock and slowly broke
it.

178
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:41,480
Sun, cold weather, and wind broke the rock,
too.

179
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,480
All these things made the incredible deep
valley called the Grand Canyon.

180
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:56,130
Wind, rain, sun, and snow - the weather is
a part of Earth's story.

181
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,260
Sun and wind make deserts.

182
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,530
Glaciers move between mountains and make valleys.

183
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,610
Rain falls on limestone and makes caves...

184
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:15,020
This story began millions of years ago, and
it is still going on.

185
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,970
What an incredible story it is!

186
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,780
- THE END -
