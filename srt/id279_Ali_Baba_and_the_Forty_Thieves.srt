by Antoine Galland

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,240
OPEN SESAME

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,920
Ali Baba was a woodcutter.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,040
He was from Persia, in the Middle East.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:29,801
One day he was at work in the woods when he saw forty men on
forty black horses.

7
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:33,761
They stopped near a huge rock.

8
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:41,681
They had forty big, heavy, brown sacks on their backs.

9
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:47,761
Ali Baba watched the men as they got off their horses.

10
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:59,641
A tall man walked to the rock and said "Open Sesame." Ali
Baba looked and looked again...

11
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:04,841
Something amazing happened... the rock opened!

12
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:08,681
Behind the rock was a cave.

13
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:14,401
The forty men went into the cave with their sacks.

14
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:22,482
Later, when the men came out of the cave, they didn't have
their sacks.

15
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:30,962
"Close Sesame," said the tall man, and the rock closed!

16
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:36,762
The forty men got on their horses and went away.

17
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:39,802
Ali Baba went to the rock.

18
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:43,562
"Open Sesame," he said.

19
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:52,802
The rock opened... and inside the cave there were hundreds
of sacks and wooden boxes.

20
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:58,962
Ali Baba opened a sack and... it was full of diamonds!

21
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:06,202
He opened another sack and... it was full of gold coins!

22
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:11,523
He opened a box and... it was full of silver!

23
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:19,123
He opened another box and... it was full of beautiful
jewels!

24
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:23,763
"These forty men are thieves," thought Ali.

25
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:30,643
"I'm going to take some of these coins home for my wife!"

26
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:37,203
He put some gold coins into his bag and went out of the
cave.

27
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:40,443
"Close Sesame," he said.

28
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:43,843
The rock closed and he went home.

29
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:48,803
Ali Baba's wife, Nasreen, was in the kitchen.

30
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:57,123
Ali Baba told her about the forty thieves and the treasure
in the cave.

31
00:02:57,123 --> 00:03:02,284
"This is wonderful news," said Nasreen.

32
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:09,884
"Can we take more money and buy a new house and new
clothes?"

33
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:15,764
"Yes, but we mustn't tell anyone," said Ali.

34
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:21,084
"The forty thieves are very dangerous men."

35
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:27,284
Ali's brother, Cassim, was outside the kitchen.

36
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:29,524
He opened the door.

37
00:03:29,524 --> 00:03:35,364
"Tell me where the cave is!" he shouted.

38
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:43,084
"You must tell me or I'm going to go and look for it
myself!"

39
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:49,404
"No! Don't do that!" said Ali.

40
00:03:49,404 --> 00:04:05,405
"Go into the woods. There's a huge rock near the big baobab tree. The rock opens when you say "Open Sesame" and closes
when you say "Close Sesame".

41
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:15,885
Cassim went to the rock. "Open Sesame," he said. He went
into the cave and the rock closed.

42
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:24,325
"This is amazing," thought Cassim. "Gold, silver...
beautiful jewels!"

43
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:31,685
He had three big sacks with him and filled them with gold
and silver and jewels.

44
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:40,205
He stood in front of the rock and said "Open Wheat", but the
rock didn't open!

45
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:46,606
He said "Open Corn," but the rock didn't open!

46
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:51,926
"Oh! What is the right word?" he thought.

47
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:53,486
Cassim was angry.

48
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:57,606
He couldn't remember the word!

49
00:04:57,606 --> 00:05:02,566
He sat down to think, but suddenly he heard horses.

50
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:06,326
The forty thieves were outside the cave!

51
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:06,966
Look!

52
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:08,766
A horse!

53
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,526
Someone's in our cave!

54
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:18,606
"He can't have our treasure! He must die!" said the tall
man.

55
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:25,206
The next morning Cassim's wife, Zhila, went to Ali Baba.

56
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:34,526
"Cassim didn't come home last night! Do you know where he
is?" she asked.

57
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:38,767
Ali told Zhila about the cave.

58
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:49,447
"Please go to the cave! The thieves are dangerous men.
They'll kill him!" she said.

59
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:52,367
Ali went to the rock.

60
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:56,407
It was closed but he heard a noise.

61
00:05:56,407 --> 00:06:00,847
"Cassim, are you there?" he said.

62
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:06,727
"Yes, yes... I'm here. Help me! I'm hurt."

63
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:15,487
"Open Sesame," said Ali Baba and the rock opened.

64
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:20,527
Cassim was on the floor... he couldn't walk!

65
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:27,007
"The thieves said I must die but I didn't die!" he said.

66
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:37,768
"You didn't die but you're hurt! Let's go home now and the
doctor can come to the house later tonight."

67
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:43,368
The next afternoon the thieves went back to the cave.

68
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:49,688
"He isn't here!" said the tall man.

69
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:59,768
"We must find him. He was hurt! We must find the doctor who
helped him!"

70
00:06:59,768 --> 00:07:04,408
The tall man found the doctor's house.

71
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:06,368
He was angry.

72
00:07:06,368 --> 00:07:14,688
"Where's the man you helped yesterday? Where's his house?"
he asked.

73
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:18,208
"I don't know," said the doctor.

74
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:23,329
"It was dark and I couldn't see the road or the houses."

75
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:29,329
"Then take me to the house tonight when it's dark," said the
tall man.

76
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:42,569
The, doctor took the tall man to Ali's house later that
night and the tall man painted a white cross on the door.

77
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:49,569
"Now I know where Cassim and his family live," he thought.

78
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:56,089
"They must all die! And I've got a plan!"

79
00:07:56,089 --> 00:08:04,409
The tall man went to the market and bought thirty-nine big
oil pots.

80
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:11,810
"Put the pots on your horses then hide inside them" he told
the thieves.

81
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:23,410
"I'm going to Ali Baba's house and you'll be in the pots.
We'll kill them all tonight when they are asleep!"

82
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,130
That evening he went to Ali Baba's house.

83
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:42,010
"Good evening. I'm an oil merchant from India and I'm very tired," he said "Have you got a room where I can sleep and a
place for my horses?"

84
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,850
"Of course! Welcome to my home," said Ali.

85
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,010
Zhila was in the kitchen with Nasreen.

86
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:57,650
"That man isn't Indian; he's Persian," said Zhila.

87
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:05,931
"I don't like him. Let's go and look at the pots on his
horses."

88
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:10,251
They went out of the house into the garden.

89
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:16,851
There were lots of stars in the sky and everything was very
quiet.

90
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:26,131
Suddenly they heard a man's voice: "When are we going to
kill Cassim and AliBaba and their wives?"

91
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"When they're asleep," said another voice.

92
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
The women looked at the pots on the horses.

93
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
Thirty-nine pots in their garden... thirty-nine men in the
pots, and one man in the house...

94
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
The Forty Thieves!

95
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"Quickly!" said Zhila.

96
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"Open the gate."

97
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
Nasreen opened the gate.

98
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"Shoo, shoo, go away! Shoo, shoo, go away!" they shouted at
the horses.

99
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
The horses ran out of the garden.

100
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
They ran and they ran and they ran.

101
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
They ran into the desert and never came back.

102
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
The tall man went into the garden when everyone was
sleeping.

103
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
His horses weren't there!

104
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
His pots weren't there!

105
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
His men weren't there!

106
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
He ran out of the garden, he ran into the desert, but he
couldn't see his horses or his men.

107
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
He ran and he ran and he ran and he never came back.

108
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
In the morning Cassim and Ali Baba woke up early and went
into the garden.

109
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"This is very strange," said Ali.

110
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
The oil merchant isn't here, and his horses aren't here!

111
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
Where are they?"

112
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"You men are very silly," said Nasreen.

113
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"Yes, very silly," said Zhila.

114
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"The oil merchant from India wasn't an oil merchant from
India."

115
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"No," said Nasreen.

116
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"He was the leader of the forty thieves!"

117
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"Where are the forty thieves now?" said Cassim.

118
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"They ran into the desert, and let's hope they'll never come
back!" said Zhila.

119
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"Tomorrow you can go and get the treasure and we'll give
some to everyone in the village!"

120
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
The next day Cassim and Ali Baba went back to the rock with
ten grey donkeys.

121
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"Open Wheat," said Cassim.

122
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"No, silly! Don't you remember? It's not Wheat. It's
Sesame!" said Ali Baba.

123
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"Of course, the word is "Sesame". Open Sesame," said Cassim.

124
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
The rock opened and they put all the wooden boxes and sacks
of treasure on the donkeys.

125
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
Then they went back to the village and gave the treasure to
the poor villagers.

126
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,131
"Thank you, Nasreen and Zhila" said the villagers.

127
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,171
"You're very clever women!"
