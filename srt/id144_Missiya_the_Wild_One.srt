1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,760
Childhood is a time of innocence, when life is 
simple and uncomplicated. Children, watching the  

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,480
comings and goings of adults, often see things 
that they don't understand until years later,  

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,240
when they are adults themselves 
and know the ways of the world.

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:43,840
And the ways of the world 
are sometimes rather sad...

5
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,600
There is still talk about her in 
the village, all these years later.  

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,920
She did not come back after she went 
away so suddenly that morning ...  

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,840
no one really cared to find out what happened to 
her. But they did not forget her. Even recently  

8
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,640
an old man in the village said her name, 
Missiya, with sadness in his voice.

9
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:31,760
And the village never again knew anyone quite like 
her. They remembered her not so much for her good  

10
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:40,640
looks as for her boldness. She was good-looking, 
though. But in those days there was no way a  

11
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,000
good-looking girl could escape from village 
life and make an exciting future for herself.  

12
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,160
What could Missiya do, except sell 
her good looks while she was young?  

13
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,000
Selling them for so little - almost nothing.

14
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,880
Every time I go back home to the 
village I see Missiya in my mind.  

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,840
She had brown skin which shone with good 
health, and a beautiful, strong body.  

16
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:20,400
She moved beautifully too. She used to carry 
a full pot of water on her hip and use her  

17
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,880
other hand to pick a fruit or a branch off 
a tree for firewood. She was full of fun.  

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,760
She ran when there was no need to run, 
smiled all the time and laughed often.

19
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,360
The women envied her, and felt jealous 
of the way men watched her lovely body.

20
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,080
Missiya never married. She never wanted to be 
like other village girls, who spent time getting  

21
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:58,080
to know boys, walking in the fields, talking of 
love, and making careful plans for the future.  

22
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,760
Missiya's house was usually full of men, 
and her parents did not mind her free and  

23
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,120
easy ways with the young men - and older 
ones - who crowded into that little house.  

24
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,640
No surprise, then, that before she was 
sixteen, people were already talking about her!

25
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:29,600
As a child I couldn't take my eyes off her. She 
had a pair of eyes which seemed enormous to me.  

26
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:38,480
Her smiling lips were full and red with betel 
juice. She used to laugh at the way I watched her,  

27
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:47,040
wide-eyed. Under her breath and still smiling, 
she used to whisper something which I knew was  

28
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:55,120
not meant for my child's ears. But there was no 
harm in her - it was her nature, her love of life!

29
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:05,840
But there were things I did not understand about 
her. Sometimes she was my friend. On some days  

30
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,120
when I saw her, she used to greet me cheerfully, 
take my hand in hers and take me into the woods  

31
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,600
to pick fruit, show me the animals and birds 
and a thousand secrets that lay hidden there.  

32
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,840
But there were days when she pretended not to see 
me and looked away, as she hurried into the woods.  

33
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,960
That always made me sad and I felt a warm tear 
roll down my face. At those times I used to  

34
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,240
look away too, pretending to look at a wild 
flower or watch some insects on the ground.

35
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,680
I knew she did not want me around, and I 
wanted her to think that it did not matter.  

36
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,600
But it did. It did.

37
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,040
I did not understand the way my 
mother felt about her, either.  

38
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,240
As I grew a year or two older, she told 
me not to go into the woods with Missiya.  

39
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:16,000
Suddenly one hot afternoon mother called me from 
the garden and said, very firmly, 'You must not  

40
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,920
see Missiya again. You're not a child any longer 
- you must stop bothering her to play with you.'

41
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,920
I couldn't understand why. I didn't say anything.  

42
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,200
I stood by my mother and looked 
out of that sun-filled room.  

43
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,320
In the garden I saw the purple bougainvillea 
and the bright yellow hibiscus flowers.  

44
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:47,840
I wanted to be out there playing with Missiya. 
There was no one to play with except Missiya.  

45
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,160
And now my mother was telling 
me I must not play with her!

46
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,040
'Then who will make me a mud house when 
it rains?' I asked my mother, confused.

47
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,760
Mother knew me. She heard the 
anxiety in my voice and said quietly,  

48
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,400
without even lifting her eyes from 
the book she was reading, 'I will.'

49
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,840
Missiya did not miss me. She did not care at 
all that she had ended a handful of my dreams.  

50
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,000
She continued to laugh her way through the days,  

51
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,760
the months. She became more beautiful as the years 
passed and her lovely body became more rounded.  

52
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,800
There was a bolder look in her eyes and a wildness 
in her movements that drove the men crazy.

53
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,240
There were violent arguments in 
the village. Like the night when  

54
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,640
old Appuhamy's wife went to search for him 
and found him inside Missiya's house, drunk.  

55
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:59,280
The whole village gathered to watch and cheer, 
although it was well past midnight. All the women  

56
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:08,400
cursed Missiya, and the men watched her with a new 
interest. Missiya did not show the least concern.  

57
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,840
She spat an enormous mouthful of betel juice 
towards them and disappeared into the night.

58
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,320
They said that she was a witch. But by now I 
was old enough to know that she was no witch.  

59
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:33,360
She was human and soon enough I knew what she 
was. I began to understand what those trips  

60
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:41,200
into the woods meant. I knew the meaning of 
those violent arguments. I knew why some women  

61
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:49,200
hated her and cursed her. I began to understand 
why women like my mother wanted to protect their  

62
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,520
daughters from her influence and 
their sons from her clever tricks.

63
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:03,040
But Missiya herself was one of the world's 
lucky ones. She didn't care what anyone said.  

64
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:11,120
She didn't care what happened to anyone. She cared 
only about one person in the whole world and that  

65
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:20,640
was herself. Perhaps, in a way, that did make 
her a witch. At least she was not quite human.

66
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,840
That thoughtless confidence of hers couldn't 
last, however. Almost ten years later,  

67
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,760
she came to live in a dark little hut that 
stood just beyond the end of our garden.  

68
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,720
By then she had begun to lose the freshness 
of her young beauty and her carefree ways.  

69
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,080
At twenty-five she was an adult woman, a 
good-looking woman, and an inviting one.  

70
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,800
She lived alone because her parents had 
died, but nothing else had changed with her.  

71
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,160
The village still hated her and loved 
her. The men still came to her by night.  

72
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,720
During the day she worked, making baskets. 
Day or night, she appeared not to care how  

73
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,720
the next meal came to her, what happened to 
her, or what she would do when she grew old.

74
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,760
When I met her for the first 
time after many years away,  

75
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,840
I was shy. She smiled at me as 
I walked past her little house.

76
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,880
'Well, well, how you've grown!' 
she said with her usual bold smile.

77
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:48,400
I said something in reply and hurried away. In the 
rapid look I gave her, I saw the heaviness of her  

78
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:55,440
body, and wondered if she was getting fat. There 
was something about her that seemed different.  

79
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:04,960
I looked back and saw her watching me. She had a 
look of catlike happiness on her face that day.

80
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,880
'Has she met some man and married him?' I 
wondered as I walked towards my parents' home.  

81
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,840
But soon enough I knew she was not married.  

82
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,840
The village now felt sorry for her - she 
was a woman growing old before her time.  

83
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,000
The men did not come to her for 
their pleasures as much as before.  

84
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,520
The village was moving into the modern world 
- just two miles away there was now a cinema,  

85
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,800
and after the late-night showing there were women 
available there too. So Missiya was finding it  

86
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,920
hard to earn enough money even for food. The 
village talked and laughed unkindly about her:  

87
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,840
how poor she was, how little she had. Her 
clothes were unwashed, her habits dirty.

88
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,680
It seemed that the world's oldest 
profession did not pay very well.

89
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,920
The morning it happened started like any other.  

90
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,640
The sun shone and the raindrops danced on the wet 
grass. I walked down to the edge of the garden,  

91
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,800
reliving the pleasures of my childhood. 
These trips back to the village filled me  

92
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:34,000
with confused thoughts - a wish for past days, 
past magic, when the world and I were young...

93
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,960
The old tree where I had sat in the shade,  

94
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,240
and cried desperate tears over some 
young sadness or other, was still there.  

95
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,600
So was the dead tree trunk where my friends and I 
had sat on so many golden evenings and watched the  

96
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:59,120
sun go down. The voices from the past whispered 
in my ear, some long gone from my life...

97
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,040
The cool air was still so 
well-known and dear to me.  

98
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,800
And the morning sun gave a silver touch 
to the rice field spread out at my feet.

99
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,720
I stopped with a start when 
I saw the two policemen.  

100
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:25,200
They looked towards our house and then looked 
away. I took a step backwards and watched them.  

101
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,600
They spoke to each other and entered the 
large shed in which the hay was stored.

102
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,240
It was early morning. There 
was no one else around.

103
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:46,880
And quietly the village began to wake up. 
First, the old businessman, the Mudalali,  

104
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,840
clearing his throat and walking to the 
corner to get his morning newspaper.  

105
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,360
He was followed by the young man who worked 
in the tea shop. Then the women appeared,  

106
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,840
wanting to know what was happening. Suddenly 
there was a crowd, and excitement in the air.  

107
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,400
And then the policemen brought out the 
terrible bundle from inside the building.  

108
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,000
I shut my eyes and turned away.

109
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:26,720
It was such a tiny bundle, a helpless little 
thing, killed by its own mother and hidden in the  

110
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:36,960
hay. It had no father who would accept it as his 
child. So it had to die. A fatherless baby in that  

111
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:43,600
little village was a terrible thing, and women 
like its mother were cursed, perhaps even killed.

112
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,840
In that lovely little village,  

113
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,040
with its sunny green fields and blue 
hills, there was no room for that child.

114
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,080
And then they brought out the mother. She didn't 
hide her head guiltily, as they wanted her to.  

115
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,800
She still held her head high, 
and looked straight at all of us.  

116
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,640
I hid behind a tree and watched her - 
I still couldn't take my eyes off her.  

117
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:30,880
She looked at the silent crowd and then she 
noticed me. She smiled at me, bold and direct,  

118
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:40,640
as always. I shut my eyes. She didn't care that 
I gave her no answering smile. She turned to  

119
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:47,840
the crowd with the same bold smile, and spat an 
enormous mouthful of betel juice towards them.

120
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:57,840
And then she went away with the policemen.
 

121
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,028
- THE END -
