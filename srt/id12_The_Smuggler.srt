00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,160
CHAPTER ONE
A Man in a Hurry

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,240
Emil Harker was a rich man.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,110
But this particular Tuesday evening, he was
a worried man.

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,010
He was more worried than he had ever been
in his life.

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,520
Harker was sitting at a desk in his office.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,300
His office was in a small forest hut.

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,820
Harker sat at his desk and looked at the piece
of paper in front of him.

8
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,760
There was something written on the piece of
paper - a short poem.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,260
Harker had written the poem himself.

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,080
It was not a very good poem, but then Harker
was not a poet, and he had written the poem

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,299
in a hurry.

12
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,860
He hadn't got much time left.

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,549
About an hour earlier, the phone had rung
in the hut.

14
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:59,970
Harker had answered it.

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,850
'Harker?' said a voice.

16
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,379
Harker recognized the voice.

17
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,770
'Ezra,' said Harker.

18
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,430
'What do you want?'

19
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,900
'Where is it?' asked Ezra.

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,140
'Where is what?' asked Harker.

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,370
'You know,' said Ezra.

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,130
'I don't know,' said Harker.

23
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,300
'Stop playing games,' said Ezra.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,170
'I'm not playing games,' said Harker.

25
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,050
'Oh yes you are,' said the voice.

26
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,230
'I'm coming to see you.'

27
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,670
'Now look,' began Harker.

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,380
But Ezra had put the phone down.

29
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,930
It was then that Harker wrote the poem.

30
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,700
He sat at his desk and wrote fast.

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,920
He tore up two or three pieces of paper before
he was satisfied.

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,870
At last the poem was finished.

33
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,730
Harker folded the paper and wrote across the
front:

34
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,800
To John Samuel Fame - please read carefully.

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,590
Harker put his pen in his pocket and looked
at his watch.

36
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,490
It was half past nine.

37
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,110
Without warning, the hut door opened.

38
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,780
A tall man with a pale face and a moustache
stood in the doorway.

39
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,950
Behind him were two other men who carried
guns.

40
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,680
Harker stood up.

41
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,409
'Now just a minute Ezra,' he said, 'Let's
talk.'

42
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:21,540
'You're the one who's going to talk,' said
Ezra.

43
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,540
'Where is it?'

44
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,990
'I've told you,' said Harker, 'I don't know
what you're talking about.'

45
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,780
'Hold his arms,' shouted Ezra to the two men.

46
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,400
The men moved fast across the room and got
hold of Harker.

47
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,459
Ezra walked over to the desk.

48
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,480
He saw the folded piece of paper and picked
it up.

49
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,030
He looked at it, then unfolded it and read
the poem.

50
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,890
'What's this?' he said.

51
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,410
Harker said nothing.

52
00:02:50,410 --> 00:03:08,640
He was sweating.

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,690
CHAPTER TWO
At the Frontier

54
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,170
Harker wasn't the only person who had an important
phone call that Tuesday evening.

55
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,310
At ten o'clock, the phone rang in the customs
shed at the frontier.

56
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,510
The phone rang three times and then one of
the two customs officers in the shed answered

57
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,849
it.

58
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,200
'Hello.

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,660
Frontier Customs here,' he said.

60
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,070
'Hello,' said a voice, 'Inspector Roland here.'

61
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,790
'Hello, Inspector,' said the customs officer,
'what can I do for you?'

62
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,250
'Do you know a man called John Samuel Fame?'
asked the Inspector.

63
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,390
'Yes,' said the customs officer, 'he crosses
the frontier a lot.

64
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,290
Perhaps two or three times a week.

65
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,629
He's a businessman.'

66
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:55,590
'That's what he says,' said the Inspector.

67
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,480
'Do you know him?' said the customs officer.

68
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,350
'Very well,' said the Inspector.

69
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,980
'What do you want me to do about him?' asked
the customs officer.

70
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,530
'Watch him,' said the Inspector.

71
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,330
'Search his car.'

72
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,860
The customs officer, whose name was Silver,
put down the phone.

73
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,600
Silver was a thin man with a high forehead
and large ears.

74
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,579
He crossed the room and sat down on a chair
by the window.

75
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:27,449
'Who was that?' asked Rank, the other customs
officer.

76
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,969
Rank was a much fatter man than Silver, with
a small moustache.

77
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:33,819
'Inspector Roland,' said Silver.

78
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:37,919
'What did he want?' asked Rank.

79
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,659
Rank was sitting on a chair with his legs
up on a table, reading a newspaper.

80
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:46,789
'He asked me about John Samuel Fame,' said
Silver.

81
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:49,479
'Who?' asked Rank.

82
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:55,839
'John Samuel Fame,' repeated Silver, 'the
businessman who crosses the frontier two or

83
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,419
three times a week.

84
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,819
He always drives a smart grey car.'

85
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,449
'Oh yes,' said Rank.

86
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,530
'What about him?'

87
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:10,460
'Inspector Roland told us to watch him,' said
Silver, 'and search his car.'

88
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,710
'Why?'

89
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,710
asked Rank.

90
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,139
'The Inspector didn't say,' said Silver.

91
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,300
'Oh,' said Rank, and turned over a page of
his newspaper.

92
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,430
Silver opened a large exercise book that was
lying on the wooden table in front of him

93
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,430
and began to write in it.

94
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:34,159
A fly landed on Rank's head and crawled down
his forehead and nose.

95
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:37,610
Rank brushed it off and went on reading the
newspaper.

96
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,099
The clock on the wall behind him ticked loudly
and the fly crawled across the lightshade

97
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:44,729
over his head.

98
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,770
Just then, both customs officers heard a car.

99
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,839
Silver looked up and stopped writing, and
the guard outside moved out into the middle

100
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,139
of the road.

101
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,960
The car came round the corner and stopped
beside the guard.

102
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,150
The guard told the driver to get out.

103
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,590
The driver switched off the engine and the
headlights, got out, and followed the guard

104
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,759
up the wooden steps of the customs hut.

105
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,800
The guard opened the door for him and the
man went inside.

106
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,199
Silver, the thin customs officer, looked up.

107
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,000
John Samuel Fame was standing in front of
him.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,250
Fame was wearing a smart dark suit and an
open-necked shirt.

109
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,419
He was a tall thin man - and rather good-looking.

110
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,809
'It's me again,' said John Samuel Fame.

111
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:39,279
'Your passport, please,' said Silver without
smiling.

112
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,240
Fame gave his passport to Silver.

113
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,690
Silver opened it and turned over the pages,
while Rank went on reading the newspaper.

114
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,729
Fame stood the other side of the table and
waited.

115
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:55,419
'Are you John Samuel Fame?' asked Silver.

116
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:58,460
'Yes, you know I am,' said Fame smiling.

117
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,710
'And are you a businessman?' asked Silver.

118
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,379
'Yes, of course!' said Fame.

119
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,520
'Why are you crossing the frontier?' asked
Silver.

120
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,840
'On business, as usual,' said Fame.

121
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,279
'How long are you going to stay here?'

122
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,279
asked Silver.

123
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,050
'Two days, as usual,' said Fame.

124
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,529
'What is all this...?'

125
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:23,509
'Have you anything to declare?' asked Silver.

126
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,210
'Nothing,' said Fame.

127
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,099
'Have you got any luggage?'

128
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,810
asked Silver.

129
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,229
'One suitcase,' said Fame.

130
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,059
Silver turned to the fat customs officer.

131
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:39,460
'Go and have a look in his car,' he said.

132
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,479
Rank nodded, folded the newspaper, and went
outside.

133
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:44,839
Fame followed him.

134
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,809
'Where's the case?' asked Rank

135
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:50,539
'In the boot,' said Fame.

136
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,429
'Let's have a look,' said Rank.

137
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:57,080
Fame opened the boot and pulled out the case.

138
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,189
'Open the case,' said Rank.

139
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,029
Fame opened it.

140
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:07,180
Rank put his fat hands inside the case and
felt among the clothes.

141
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,559
He pulled out a thick brown bottle.

142
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,059
'What's this?' he asked Fame.

143
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,870
'Medicine,' said Fame, and laughed.

144
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,509
'Hm,' said Rank, and put the bottle back.

145
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:24,750
Then Rank looked inside the car, and under
the car and on the roof.

146
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,749
Fame stood and watched him.

147
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:28,560
Rank found nothing.

148
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,870
'Follow me,' Rank said to Fame, and the two
men went back into the customs shed.

149
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,190
'He hasn't got anything,' said Rank to Silver.

150
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,200
'Right, Mr Fame,' said Silver.

151
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,520
'You can go.

152
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,650
Goodnight.'

153
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,450
'Goodnight,' said Fame.

154
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,700
He went out and shut the door, walked down
the steps, and over to his car.

155
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,950
He got in and shut the door.

156
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,020
The guard walked over to the pole across the
road, and lifted it up.

157
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,320
Fame started the car and drove off.

158
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,390
The guard lowered the pole and watched Fame's
car disappearing into the distance.

159
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,820
Inside the customs hut, Rank, the fat customs
officer, picked up his newspaper again and

160
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:38,410
went on reading.

161
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:44,950
CHAPTER THREE
Strange Meeting

162
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,820
John Samuel Fame drove very fast along the
white road.

163
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,900
There was a full moon and there were no clouds
so he could see clearly, even without the

164
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,010
headlights.

165
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,820
The road was straight and flat and empty.

166
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,750
Fame looked at his watch.

167
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:05,320
The time was half past ten and Harker had
told him to be there at ten o'clock.

168
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,860
Fame realized he was already half an hour
late for his appointments He knew that Harker

169
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:15,320
would be angry with him, because Harker didn't
like people who were late for appointments.

170
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,380
John Samuel Fame accelerated and the car roared
forward down the white road.

171
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,660
After about ten minutes, Fame saw the turning
to Harker's hut.

172
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,580
Fame turned left and drove up a hill.

173
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,820
'When you get to the top,' Harker had said,
'stop the car on the edge of the wood and

174
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,780
walk until you reach the hut.'

175
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,190
Fame stopped the car and walked into the wood.

176
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:45,420
In the moonlight, it was easy to see his way,
and he walked quietly between the trees.

177
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,520
After about three minutes, he saw the hut.

178
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,000
There was a light on inside and Fame saw Harker's
car parked outside.

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,590
'When you get to the hut,' Harker had said,
'whistle three times and wait for an answer.'

180
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:05,660
Fame whistled, once, twice, three times, and
waited.

181
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,360
There was no answer.

182
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,650
He whistled again.

183
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,430
There was still no answer.

184
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,870
Where was Harker?

185
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,790
What was wrong?

186
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,050
Fame whistled again.

187
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,980
Still no answer.

188
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,600
Something was wrong.

189
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,160
Fame carefully walked towards the hut.

190
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,200
Silently, he reached the door.

191
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,940
It was half-open.

192
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,730
Fame pushed the door right open and went inside.

193
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,320
There was no one there.

194
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,520
In the middle of the room was a chair and
a desk with a lamp on it.

195
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,330
There were some books and papers on the desk
too.

196
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,710
In one corner of the room was a small black
cupboard.

197
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:50,620
The cupboard door was open and there were
some cups and glasses inside.

198
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,590
On one wall, there was a photograph of a young
man on a horse.

199
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,310
Next to the photograph, there was a large
map.

200
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,850
Fame crossed over to the desk.

201
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:05,800
A green pen and a small notebook were on the
desk, among the books and papers.

202
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,570
Fame recognized them.

203
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,960
They belonged to Harker, but where was Harker?

204
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,800
Fame was three-quarters of an hour late, so
perhaps Harker had gone.

205
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:22,570
But Harker's car was still there and his pen
and his notebook were still on the desk.

206
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,370
Suddenly Fame noticed the shadow.

207
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,700
It was moving backwards and forwards across
the opposite wall.

208
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,920
Fame looked up.

209
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,190
Hanging from the ceiling of the hut, just
to the left of the door, was a man.

210
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,930
He was swinging from the end of a rope.

211
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:56,410
It was Harker.

212
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,410
CHAPTER FOUR
A Narrow Escape

213
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,170
Fame stood still, looking at the swinging
man.

214
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,670
Below him, a chair lay on its side on the
floor.

215
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,720
So, thought Fame, Harker had stood on the
chair, tied the rope to the roof, tightened

216
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,660
the rope around his neck and jumped.

217
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,790
Fame picked the chair up, put it underneath
the swinging man, and climbed up on it.

218
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,020
He put out his hands and felt Harker's body.

219
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,870
Harker was still warm - he hadn't been dead
long.

220
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,880
Fame took a small knife out of one of his
coat pockets and putting one arm round Harker's

221
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,300
body, cut the rope.

222
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,990
Harker was a heavy man and Fame couldn't hold
him.

223
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,170
Harker, Fame, and the chair fell to the floor.

224
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,820
Fame got up and looked at Harker.

225
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,790
Then he knelt down and loosened the rope round
Harker's neck.

226
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,470
Then Fame saw some blood on Harker's shirt.

227
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,620
He lifted up the shirt and looked underneath.

228
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,010
There wasn't a mark on Harker's body.

229
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,779
The blood on Harker's shirt wasn't Harker's
blood.

230
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:07,180
Someone had been in that room before Fame.

231
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,350
Someone had fought with Harker.

232
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,570
Fame looked round the room.

233
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,510
Fame noticed a broken bottle on the floor
near the door, which he hadn't seen before.

234
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,840
The bottle had broken into three pieces and
the three pieces lay on the floor near the

235
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,510
door.

236
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,600
Someone had attacked Harker.

237
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,920
Harker hadn't hanged himself.

238
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,640
Some men had been in the hut before Fame.

239
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,210
They had fought with Harker, and then they
had hanged him.

240
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,110
Fame began to look through Harker's pockets
but they were empty.

241
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,680
Someone had already gone through Harker's
pockets and taken everything.

242
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,250
Fame looked round the room again.

243
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,460
Then he saw the bit of paper lying on the
floor, near Harker's desk.

244
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,150
Fame picked it up.

245
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,660
There was writing on the paper - Harker's
writing.

246
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,570
Fame looked at the writing but he could not
understand it.

247
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,810
It was a poem.

248
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,650
So Harker had written a poem.

249
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,330
But why?

250
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,750
Harker wasn't a poet.

251
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,050
He didn't even read poetry.

252
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:15,390
Harker was a clever man, a tough man, but
he was interested in money, not in poetry.

253
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,690
He read newspapers, he didn't read poetry.

254
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:25,070
Fame was about to put the poem in his pocket,
when he saw what was written on the front:

255
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,770
To John Samuel Fame - please read carefully.

256
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,529
So it was a message - a message for him.

257
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:40,440
Fame read the poem carefully but he still
did not understand it.

258
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,670
Do not walk easy roads.

259
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,740
Tall men strain under heavy loads.

260
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,990
They bend beneath the weight, get tired beneath
the load

261
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,540
They go in pain and hate they wander down
that road,

262
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:05,710
But then against the wall they stand and near
one rock they rest their hand.

263
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,860
Emil Harker

264
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,940
Just as Fame was finishing the poem, he heard
voices.

265
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,250
Men's voices.

266
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,940
The men were coming towards the door.

267
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,160
Fame just had time to get to the window, raise
it silently and get through before the men

268
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,880
reached the hut.

269
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,120
He landed on his feet and leant against the
outside wall of the hut.

270
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,070
He listened.

271
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:35,360
He could hear the two voices, one deep and
strong, the other high and nervous, with an

272
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,160
Italian accent.

273
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,850
'Someone's been here,' said the man with the
high voice.

274
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,180
'Someone's been here and cut him down.'

275
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,550
'Where's the piece of paper with the poem
on it?' said the other man, with the deep

276
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,550
voice.

277
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,200
'I don't know,' said the first man.

278
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,680
I can't see it.

279
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,990
I'm sure I must have dropped it on the floor.'

280
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,580
There was silence for a moment.

281
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,709
'It's not here,' said the man with the high
voice.

282
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:11,060
'Someone's been here and taken it,' said the
man with the deep voice.

283
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,189
'The window!'

284
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:15,839
shouted one of the men suddenly.

285
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,480
Fame didn't wait.

286
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,559
He ran through the trees and towards his car.

287
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,039
When he reached the car, he took the keys
out of his coat pocket.

288
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,309
Behind him, Fame could hear the shouts of
the two men running from the hut.

289
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:35,460
Fame unlocked the car door, jumped in and
started the car.

290
00:17:35,460 --> 00:18:09,440
As the car roared away down the hill in the
moonlight, Fame heard the sound of guns.

291
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,999
CHAPTER FIVE
A Night in Darna

292
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:19,490
Fame didn't stop until he reached the town
of Darna.

293
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,809
It was after midnight when he stopped the
car outside the Garden Hotel.

294
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:27,850
Fame always stayed at the Garden Hotel when
he went to Darna.

295
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,090
There was a light on in the hotel entrance
but the door was shut.

296
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,820
Fame rang the bell and waited.

297
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:39,789
After a minute, the door was opened a little
and an old man put his head round.

298
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:41,870
It was the night porter at the Garden Hotel.

299
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,120
He'd worked there for years.

300
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,120
'Hello, Mr Fame,' said the porter smiling.

301
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,690
'You're late.'

302
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,910
'Yes,' said Fame, 'I had a bad journey.'

303
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,110
'Oh, I'm sorry,' said the porter.

304
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,120
'But your room's ready.'

305
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,460
'Good,' said Fame, 'I'm tired.'

306
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,539
The porter took Fame's case and led Fame into
the hotel.

307
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:10,320
Fame's room was number 18 on the first floor.

308
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,480
Fame had stayed there before.

309
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,080
It was a nice room with a view over the lake.

310
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,049
But tonight Fame wasn't interested in the
view.

311
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:24,529
When the porter left him, Fame sat in a chair
by the window, thinking.

312
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:25,529
Harker was dead.

313
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:26,970
That was certain.

314
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,129
And Harker had been murdered.

315
00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:29,640
That, too, was certain.

316
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,860
He had probably been murdered by the two men
at the hut.

317
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,720
They had killed him and then hung his body
from the ceiling.

318
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,909
They had wanted people to think Harker had
killed himself.

319
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:43,429
But Fame knew better.

320
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:45,250
Why had they killed him?

321
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,890
And why had they returned to search for that
piece of paper?

322
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,990
The piece of paper was addressed to him.

323
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,809
Fame took it out of his pocket, unfolded it
and read the poem again:

324
00:19:57,809 --> 00:19:58,950
Great men

325
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,299
Do not walk easy roads.

326
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:03,289
Tall men

327
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,409
Strain under heavy loads.

328
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:07,789
They bend beneath the weight,

329
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,389
get tired beneath the load.

330
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:12,879
They go in pain and hate

331
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,769
They wander down that road,

332
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:18,889
But then against the wall they stand

333
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:25,779
and near one rock they rest their hand Emil
Harker

334
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:29,509
What was the message hidden in this strange
poem?

335
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:33,539
Harker wanted Fame to understand the message
but he didn't want the other men to understand

336
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,210
it.

337
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,909
Fame tried to think about Harker.

338
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:44,239
Harker was rich, he was a smuggler, he was
powerful, and he was Fame's boss.

339
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,179
Harker had many enemies.

340
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:48,210
Probably he had many secrets.

341
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,260
Now he was dead - murdered.

342
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,570
What was Fame to do?

343
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,150
He couldn't go to the police.

344
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,309
The police were no friends of Harker's or
Fame's.

345
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:01,950
He couldn't go back across the frontier, not
yet.

346
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,190
Fame had a job to do.

347
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,960
He decided to ring Zara.

348
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,789
There was a telephone on a small white table
next to the bed.

349
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:13,390
Fame rang Zara's number and waited.

350
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,850
'Hello,' said Zara.

351
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,940
'Zara?' said Fame.

352
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,110
'Who's that?' said the voice.

353
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,000
'It's me,' said Fame, 'Fame.'

354
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,440
'Fame,' said the voice.

355
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,850
'What are you ringing at this time for?'

356
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:33,840
'I'm sorry, Zara,' said Fame, 'but I've got
to see you very soon.

357
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,650
Harker's dead.'

358
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,970
'Dead!' said Zara.

359
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,769
She sounded shocked.

360
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:42,820
'Yes,' said Fame.

361
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,120
'Look, can you come over here first thing
in the morning?

362
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,149
I'm at the Garden Hotel.

363
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:51,119
I'll meet you on the terrace at half past
eight.

364
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,200
OK?'

365
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,190
'OK,' said Zara, 'see you then.'

366
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:01,320
'Goodbye,' said Fame, and he put the phone
down.

367
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,489
Fame undressed and got into bed.

368
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,210
Next to the bed on the small white table was
a radio.

369
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,129
Fame turned on the radio to listen to the
news.

370
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:16,700
'The golden head of the Pharaoh Chefren IV,
which was stolen from the Darna Municipal

371
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,919
Museum yesterday evening, is still missing.

372
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,200
The police under Inspector Francis Roland
are still looking for the head.'

373
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,149
Fame smiled.

374
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:32,090
He hadn't heard about the stolen head, but
he knew Inspector Roland.

375
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:47,879
Fame turned off the radio and was asleep within
a few minutes.

376
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:52,860
CHAPTER SIX
On the Terrace

377
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,710
The next morning Fame was awake early.

378
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:01,480
The first thing he did was to make a copy
of the poem and then he went downstairs.

379
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,610
It was getting light and people were beginning
to move in the streets.

380
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,389
Fame went out onto the terrace.

381
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:10,519
Zara arrived an hour later.

382
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:14,830
She was looking very pretty in a light blue
dress and a dark blue headscarf.

383
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,700
'Hello, Zara,' said Fame.

384
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
'Hello, Fame,' said Zara.

385
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,289
'Sit down,' said Fame.

386
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:27,140
When they had both sat down, Fame called the
waiter and ordered two coffees.

387
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,190
'Well,' said Zara, 'so Harker's dead.'

388
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,869
'Yes,' said Fame.

389
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:37,070
And he told her what had happened.

390
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,639
He told Zara how he had found Harker hanging,
how the two men had then arrived and looked

391
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:47,309
for the piece of paper, how he had escaped
and spent the night at the hotel.

392
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:51,259
'And where's the poem?' said Zara, when Fame
had finished.

393
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:53,950
'Here,' said Fame.

394
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,629
He handed her the piece of paper and Zara
read the poem.

395
00:23:57,629 --> 00:24:01,740
'There's a message hidden in the poem,' said
Zara.

396
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,900
'I know there is,' said Fame, 'but what is
the message?'

397
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:11,270
'I don't know,' said Zara, 'but we can find
out.'

398
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,850
It'll take time,' said Fame.

399
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:17,330
'And before we try and find out the answer,
what are we going to do next, now that Harker's

400
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,409
dead?'

401
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:21,809
'Well,' said Zara, 'the business can go on.

402
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:24,840
Don's waiting for you and the car in the hide-out
as usual.'

403
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:31,299
'Yes, but who'll be the boss now that Harker's
dead?' asked Fame.

404
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:32,299
'Ezra?'

405
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:35,040
'Not Ezra,' said Zara.

406
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,750
'That's something I was going to tell you.

407
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,739
Ezra and Harker had an argument last week
and Ezra left the gang.

408
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:44,289
He's working on his own now.'

409
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:46,590
'I see,' said Fame.

410
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,740
'Who's in charge then?'

411
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,970
'I am,' said Zara, smiling.

412
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,940
'You?' said Fame.

413
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,999
'Yes,' said Zara, 'why not?

414
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:59,080
Or don't you think a woman can lead a gang?'

415
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,840
'Well,' said Fame, 'I don't know...'

416
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,809
'Anyway,' said Zara, I'm the new boss, so
I give the orders.

417
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,570
And I want you to keep your appointment with
Don this morning.

418
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,529
Where's the car?'

419
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:14,070
'Outside,' said Fame.

420
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,289
Just then, the waiter came back with the two
coffees and put them down on the table.

421
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:20,779
Fame paid the waiter and he went away.

422
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:26,100
'Why did Harker and Ezra quarrel?' asked Fame.

423
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,989
'Ezra never liked Harker,' said Zara, 'and
then last week they argued over a job.'

424
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,009
'What job?' asked Fame.

425
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:37,850
'I don't know,' said Zara, 'but I think it
was something important.

426
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,600
Ezra shouted at Harker and Harker told him
to get out.'

427
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,059
'I see,' said Fame.

428
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:46,460
He was quiet for a moment.

429
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:52,059
'You don't think,' Fame asked suddenly, 'that
Ezra might have killed Harker, do you?'

430
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:53,970
'I don't know,' replied Zara.

431
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,350
'It's possible.'

432
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,610
Fame and Zara were the only two people on
the terrace.

433
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:05,350
It was already quite hot and most people were
indoors, eating their breakfast in the shade.

434
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:09,309
Then another waiter came out of the hotel
and came up to Fame.

435
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:14,940
The other waiter was a bald-headed man with
a scar on his left cheek.

436
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,909
'Telephone call for you, Mr Fame,' he said.

437
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:20,100
'Thanks,' said Fame.

438
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,769
'Excuse me a minute, Zara.'

439
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:23,080
'Of course,' said Zara.

440
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,399
'I'll wait here.'

441
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:28,639
Fame crossed the terrace and went into the
hotel.

442
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:31,369
The phone was lying on the desk in the hall.

443
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:32,639
Fame picked it up.

444
00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:35,600
'Hello,' he said.

445
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,059
No answer.

446
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:40,330
'Hello?' said Fame again.

447
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,580
Still no answer.

448
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,149
'Hello, who is it?' asked Fame.

449
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:48,820
Then he heard the phone put down on the other
end.

450
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,090
What was going on?

451
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,940
Fame put his phone down and went back onto
the terrace.

452
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,249
Zara wasn't there, nor was the bald-headed
waiter.

453
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:01,269
Fame began to sweat.

454
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:02,429
'Waiter!'

455
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:04,760
shouted Fame.

456
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,929
'Waiter!'

457
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:08,809
The waiter who had brought the coffee came
out of the hotel.

458
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:10,989
'Yes sir?' he said.

459
00:27:10,989 --> 00:27:13,580
'Where's the other waiter?' asked Fame.

460
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,119
'What do you mean?' said the waiter.

461
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:18,679
'I'm the only waiter on duty at the moment.'

462
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,369
'A bald man,' said Fame, 'with a scar on his
left cheek.'

463
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:25,820
A bald man with a scar,' said the waiter.

464
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,269
We haven't got a waiter who looks like that,
sir.'

465
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:31,399
Fame didn't wait to hear any more.

466
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:35,330
A car was starting up on the other side of
the garden wall.

467
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,220
Fame ran to the edge of the terrace, jumped
over the wall and down onto the pavement below.

468
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:46,249
A long black American car was pulling away
from the pavement and Fame could see the driver.

469
00:27:46,249 --> 00:28:14,590
It was the bald-headed waiter.

470
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,639
CHAPTER SEVEN
Keeping an Appointment

471
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:22,019
Fame ran across the street and jumped into
his own car.

472
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:26,070
He started the engine and accelerated away
from the pavement.

473
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,090
The American car was turning into the main
road that went out of the town and into the

474
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,320
hills.

475
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,659
Fame followed it.

476
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:37,140
As long as they were in the town, Fame kept
close to the American car.

477
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:42,710
But when the two cars had left the town and
were on the hill road, the American car moved

478
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,799
further ahead.

479
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,190
Fame could just read the car number, ZX 425.

480
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:54,249
He wrote it with his finger on the dust of
the window.

481
00:28:54,249 --> 00:29:00,370
Then after another minute, Fame could no longer
see the American car, but he kept going.

482
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:05,850
He was driving in the hills above Darna, looking
down over the town and the lake.

483
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,590
Fame knew the road well.

484
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,379
He took it each time he came to Darna.

485
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:15,019
The road to Don's hideout turned off this
road a few miles ahead.

486
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:20,490
Well, Zara had told him to go and see Don,
and at least he would get help there.

487
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,840
Don was a member of their gang.

488
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,629
Fame drove on as fast as he could.

489
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:31,479
He was just coming round a long left hand
bend when he saw a girl in a blue dress standing

490
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,899
at the side of the road and waving at him.

491
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,119
It was Zara.

492
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,530
Fame put on the brakes and the car stopped.

493
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:42,230
'Get in!' he shouted.

494
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,460
Zara got in.

495
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,499
She looked pale and worried and her right
cheek was bleeding.

496
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:49,690
'Are you all right?' said Fame.

497
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,739
'Yes,' said Zara, 'but he's got the poem.'

498
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:56,869
'Don't worry,' said Fame, 'I've got a copy
of the poem.

499
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:58,249
What happened?'

500
00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:02,970
'Well,' said Zara, 'as soon as you'd gone
in to answer the phone, the bald-headed waiter

501
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,720
came over to our table.

502
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,100
I thought he was going to take my coffee cup.

503
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,749
But he suddenly held me tightly and put his
hand over my mouth.

504
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:14,480
I tried to escape but he was very strong and
had a gun.

505
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,369
In the car he took the poem from me and then
he left me on the side of the road.'

506
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:20,899
'Well,' said Fame.

507
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:23,269
'I've got the car number.'

508
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:25,769
'And he's got the poem,' said Zara.

509
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:28,799
'Don't worry,' said Fame, 'I've got a copy.'

510
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,129
'Oh yes,' said Zara, 'I forgot.'

511
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:34,129
She looked at him.

512
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:35,900
'Where are we going now?'

513
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,900
she asked.

514
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,730
'We're going to Don's,' said Fame.

515
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,629
'We're going to keep that appointment.'

516
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:47,979
Fame and Zara drove slowly up the road until
they came to the turning to Don's hideout.

517
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:52,739
The sun was now high in the sky and the day
was very hot.

518
00:30:52,739 --> 00:30:55,609
Fame turned the car into the narrow dusty
road.

519
00:30:55,609 --> 00:31:00,250
Then the road went down to a small valley
and crossed a dried-up stream.

520
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:06,570
Three or four goats were trying to reach the
few dusty leaves of an old white tree.

521
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:11,229
Fame sounded his horn twice so that Don would
know Fame had arrived.

522
00:31:11,229 --> 00:31:14,559
Then he turned in at an open gate.

523
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,129
They were in a small yard.

524
00:31:16,129 --> 00:31:18,899
To the left was a long brown shed.

525
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:22,539
To the right was a small flat-roofed house.

526
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:25,359
Some chickens ran across the yard and behind
the shed.

527
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:30,649
A fat man with a short black beard and a blue
apron came out of the shed as Fame stopped

528
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:31,669
the car.

529
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:34,440
'Hello, Don,' said Fame.

530
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:41,139
'Hello, Fame,' said Don, and seeing Zara,
he added, 'Hello, Zara.'

531
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:42,809
'Hello,' said Zara.

532
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:46,320
'We've got a lot to talk about, Don,' said
Fame.

533
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,960
'Go in and sit down,' said Don.

534
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,779
'I'll follow you.'

535
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:53,179
He spoke slowly and smiled.

536
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:58,229
When he smiled, he showed a row of shining
white teeth.

537
00:31:58,229 --> 00:32:01,830
Fame and Zara got out of the car and went
into the house.

538
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,490
Don drove the car into the shed.

539
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,760
Inside the house, it was dark and cool.

540
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,389
The shutters were closed and there was a large
wooden table in the middle of the room.

541
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:16,590
There was a rocking chair in one corner and
several stools.

542
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:21,740
Zara sat down in the rocking chair and Fame
sat down on one of the stools.

543
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,190
Don came in from the yard and joined them.

544
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,379
He gave Fame his car keys and he sat down
on a stool.

545
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,789
He took a cigar and a box of matches from
his apron pocket.

546
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:36,039
He put the cigar in his mouth, struck a match
and lit the cigar.

547
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:43,200
'Well,' he said, sending a cloud of smoke
up to the ceiling, 'what's the news?'

548
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,599
'Harker's dead,' said Fame.

549
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,190
Don nearly dropped his cigar.

550
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:54,220
He opened his mouth to speak, but before he
could speak, two cars came roaring into the

551
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,580
yard.

552
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,340
Some men dressed in black jumped out of the
cars and ran towards the house.

553
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,259
They were policemen.

554
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:04,010
The leading man was not dressed in black.

555
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,570
Fame recognized him.

556
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:27,399
It was Inspector Roland.

557
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:29,701
CHAPTER EIGHT
Inspector Roland

558
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:35,529
Well, well,' said Inspector Roland, coming
into the room.

559
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:37,059
'Mr Fame.'

560
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:40,370
'Hello, Inspector,' said Fame, 'what can we
do for you?'

561
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,799
'You can stay where you are,' said the Inspector.

562
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,529
There were four policemen with the Inspector
and one of them was a very tall man.

563
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,340
He was holding a large gun.

564
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,350
He stood by the door and kept the gun pointing
at Fame, Zara, and Don.

565
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:59,869
'Excuse me, Inspector,' said Don, 'but this
is my house.'

566
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:03,440
'Shut up,' said Inspector Roland.

567
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,749
The other three policemen began to search
the place.

568
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:10,700
One of them crossed the yard to the shed,
one of them walked round the yard, and the

569
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,740
other began searching Don's house.

570
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,780
The tall man stayed by the door pointing the
large gun.

571
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,750
A clock on the wall above the rocking chair
ticked loudly.

572
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,760
Fame looked at Zara, Zara looked at Fame.

573
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,600
They both looked at Don.

574
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,690
All three looked at the Inspector and the
man with the gun.

575
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,190
Nobody said anything.

576
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:38,630
Everything was silent in the house, except
for the clock.

577
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,179
After a few minutes, Fame spoke to the Inspector.

578
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:45,920
'What are they looking for?' he asked.

579
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
No answer.

580
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,570
'What are they looking for, Inspector?'

581
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,710
Fame asked again.

582
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,380
'Shut up,' said the Inspector.

583
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,040
'All right,' said Fame and he was silent.

584
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,310
For half an hour, they sat in the cool room.

585
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,610
Zara looked straight ahead of her.

586
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:09,590
Don finished one cigar and lit another one,
and Fame tapped his fingers on the wooden

587
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,650
table.

588
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,350
'Don't do that!' said the Inspector suddenly.

589
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,430
'Don't do what?' asked Fame.

590
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:21,050
'Don't tap your fingers on the table,' said
the Inspector.

591
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:25,690
'Sorry,' said Fame and stopped tapping.

592
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,850
Just then, one of the men came in from the
yard.

593
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:28,850
'Inspector!'

594
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,270
shouted the policeman.

595
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,260
'There are two cars in the shed,' said the
man.

596
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,290
'Shall I search them?'

597
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:40,410
'I'll search them myself,' said the Inspector
and he went out with the man.

598
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,910
Fame looked at Don and raised his eyebrows.

599
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:45,120
Don shook his head.

600
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,760
The very tall policeman with the gun looked
suspiciously for Don to Fame, and his finger

601
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,930
tightened on the gun.

602
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:57,880
Don smoked his cigar and looked straight ahead
of him, while Fame looked at the ceiling.

603
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,130
Zara just smiled.

604
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:04,240
'What are you smiling at?' said Fame to Zara.

605
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,190
'Nothing,' said Zara.

606
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,100
'Nothing?' asked Fame.

607
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,430
'I was thinking,' said Zara.

608
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,470
'What about?' asked Fame.

609
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:17,330
'Life,' said Zara smiling.

610
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:22,080
Nobody talked or moved again until Inspector
Roland came back a few minutes later.

611
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,370
'The boot of one of the cars is locked,' said
the Inspector.

612
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,750
'Who's got the key?'

613
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,960
'I have,' said Fame.

614
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,100
'Give it to me,' said the Inspector.

615
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:37,150
Fame gave him the key and the Inspector went
outside again.

616
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,220
In a few minutes, he was back.

617
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,290
He called the other three policemen and they
all hurried into the room.

618
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:48,760
The Inspector and all the policemen stood
and looked at Don, Fame and Zara.

619
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,690
Suddenly the Inspector walked across the room
and hit Fame across the face.

620
00:36:53,690 --> 00:37:09,470
'Now,' said the Inspector, 'let's talk.'

621
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:15,420
CHAPTER NINE
The Photograph

622
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,630
'What did you do that for?' asked Fame.

623
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,160
The Inspector smiled.

624
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,960
'I just wanted to wake you up,' he said.

625
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,660
'I was awake already,' said Fame.

626
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,590
The Inspector stopped smiling.

627
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,240
'I'm not here to waste my time,' said Inspector
Roland.

628
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,650
'I'm looking for something.'

629
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,400
'We noticed that,' said Don.

630
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,850
'You know what I'm looking for, don't you?'
said the Inspector, turning to Don.

631
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,790
'No, I don't,' said Don.

632
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,230
'Don't lie to me,' said the Inspector.

633
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,170
'I'm not lying,' said Don.

634
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,350
'What are you looking for?'

635
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,040
The Inspector looked hard at Don.

636
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,610
Then he turned to one of the policemen.

637
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,900
'Have you got the newspaper?' asked Inspector
Roland.

638
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:02,380
'Here it is, Inspector,' answered the policeman,
taking a newspaper from his pocket and handing

639
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,860
it to the Inspector.

640
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,170
'Yesterday's paper,' said the Inspector.

641
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,170
'Listen.'

642
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,280
And the Inspector began to read:

643
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,260
Famous Treasure Stolen From Museum

644
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,190
DARNA, Tuesday.

645
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:22,430
Late yesterday, it was discovered that the
museum's most valuable treasure, 3,000-year-old

646
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:27,850
Egyptian gold head of the Pharoah, Chefren
IV, was missing.

647
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:34,150
The Director of the Museum, Professor K. Tan
said he had no idea how the head was stolen.

648
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:39,000
The head, which is the museum's treasure,
only arrived there last week.

649
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,260
The Darna Police, under Inspector Francis
Roland are investigating the crime

650
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,790
The Inspector stopped reading and looked up.

651
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,270
'I heard about that,' said Fame.

652
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,010
'When?' asked the Inspector sharply.

653
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:58,470
'Yesterday evening,' said Fame, 'on the radio.'

654
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,750
He smiled.

655
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,220
So did Zara.

656
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,700
Don laughed.

657
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,230
The Inspector looked annoyed.

658
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:07,170
'Don't waste my time,' said the Inspector.

659
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,260
'What do you know about the head?'

660
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,470
'Nothing,' said Fame.

661
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,240
'Is that what you're looking for?'

662
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,530
'Perhaps,' said the Inspector.

663
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,430
Fame laughed.

664
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,340
'Look, Inspector,' he said, 'I didn't steal
that head.

665
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,840
Nor did he.'

666
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,180
He pointed at Don.

667
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,180
'Nor did she.'

668
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,400
He pointed at Zara.

669
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,680
'None of us stole it.

670
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,730
You're wasting your time.'

671
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,880
'I'm not so sure,' said the Inspector.

672
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,760
'Look at this.'

673
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,230
He handed Fame a photograph.

674
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,630
Fame looked at it.

675
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,060
The photograph had been taken inside the museum.

676
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,790
It showed a group of men standing round the
golden head of Chefren IV.

677
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,650
The men were all holding glasses and smiling.

678
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:54,330
'A lot of important people came to the museum
last week,' said the Inspector.

679
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:58,510
'There was a reception to celebrate the arrival
of the Pharaoh's head.

680
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,200
That photograph was taken at the reception.'

681
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,030
'I see,' said Fame.

682
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:09,870
'Now look very closely at the men in the photograph,'
said Inspector Roland.

683
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:14,530
Fame looked - a group of happy smiling men
at a party.

684
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,300
Fame didn't recognize any of the men at first.

685
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,570
Then he looked more closely.

686
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,580
There was a man on the left, half hidden by
the man in front.

687
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,850
It was Harker.

688
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,880
'Do you recognize anybody?' asked the Inspector.

689
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,090
'Yes,' said Fame.

690
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,910
'Who?' asked the Inspector.

691
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,310
'The man on the left,' said Fame.

692
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,590
'It's Harker.'

693
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:39,010
'Exactly,' said Inspector Roland, 'Harker.'

694
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,100
'OK,' said Fame, 'so Harker was at the reception.

695
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,930
What does that prove?'

696
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,540
'Look at the back of the photograph,' said
the Inspector.

697
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,010
Fame looked.

698
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,760
On the back of the photograph was written:

699
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,850
C 304 Monday

700
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,370
It was Harker's writing.

701
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:00,970
'Do you recognize the writing?' asked the
Inspector.

702
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,790
'No,' said Fame.

703
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,690
'Don't you?' said the Inspector.

704
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,220
'Well I'll tell you whose writing it is.

705
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,220
It's Harker's.'

706
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,840
'How do you know?' asked Fame.

707
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,810
We found the photograph in Harker's house,'
said Inspector Roland.

708
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,540
'And we are sure that the writing on the back
of the photograph is Harker's writing.'

709
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,820
'What were you doing in his house?' asked
Fame.

710
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,030
'Searching it,' said the Inspector.

711
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,030
'Why?'

712
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,030
asked Fame.

713
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,990
'We had a phone call,' said the Inspector.

714
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,370
'Someone told us to go to Harker's house.

715
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:34,010
They said we'd find something interesting.'

716
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,020
Fame was thinking fast.

717
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:41,340
So Harker had stolen the golden head, or arranged
for someone to steal it.

718
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,210
Someone had told Inspector Roland.

719
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,070
Someone who didn't like Harker.

720
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:50,250
Now Inspector Roland suspected Fame, Don and
Zara because they all worked for Harker.

721
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,130
But did the Inspector know that Harker was
dead?

722
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,320
'Have you got Harker?'

723
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,930
Fame asked the Inspector suddenly.

724
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,570
'Not yet,' said Inspector Roland, 'but we'll
get him soon.

725
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,880
Anyway we've got you.'

726
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,720
So the Inspector didn't know that Harker was
dead.

727
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,090
Good, thought Fame.

728
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,050
He had an idea.

729
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,410
'Inspector Roland,' Fame said.

730
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,920
'You're quite right.

731
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,950
You've got us.

732
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,530
But we don't know anything about the head.

733
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,540
Harker planned this on his own.'

734
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:26,140
Inspector Roland looked at Fame, then at Don,
then at Zara.

735
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:30,200
'It's quite true, Inspector,' said Zara, 'we
know nothing about this business.'

736
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,030
'In fact,' said Fame, 'Harker should have
told us about the head, but he didn't.

737
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,540
We don't like that.

738
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,100
I'm going to suggest an arrangement with you.'

739
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,520
'What kind of arrangement?' asked Inspector
Roland.

740
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,180
'You let us go,' said Fame, 'and we'll get
Harker for you.'

741
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,100
Inspector Roland laughed and so did the policemen.

742
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,870
'I can't do that,' said the Inspector.

743
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:58,620
'If I let you go, you'll leave the country
tonight with Harker and the head.'

744
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,220
'Look,' said Fame, 'I'll tell you what I'll
do.

745
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,650
Don here can stay with you, as a hostages.

746
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:09,980
Let me and Zara go and we'll get Harker for
you.'

747
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,550
There was silence in the room.

748
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,780
Inspector Roland was thinking.

749
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,040
Use a thief to catch a thief, thought the
Inspector.

750
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,960
Not a bad idea.

751
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,090
Fame and Zara would get Harker for him, and
then he, Inspector Roland, could get Harker

752
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,600
and Fame and Zara.

753
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,370
Not a bad idea at all.

754
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:54,310
'OK,' said Inspector Roland.

755
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:59,520
CHAPTER TEN
Room 304

756
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,500
Inspector Roland accepted the arrangement
and his men took Don back to the town.

757
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,020
Fame and Zara took one of the two cars from
Don's shed.

758
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,750
Now they were driving back along the hill
road towards Darna.

759
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,970
'Hungry?'

760
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:16,150
Fame asked Zara, as they began to drive down
to the town.

761
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,870
'Yes,' said Zara.

762
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:19,100
'Right,' said Fame.

763
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,480
'I know somewhere nice where we can eat.'

764
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,120
They could see the lake now.

765
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,020
The early afternoon sun was shining on the
little boats.

766
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:32,070
Near the bottom of the hill, Fame turned the
car off the main road and drove towards the

767
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,260
lake.

768
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,890
By the lake, there was a little restaurant.

769
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:40,230
The restaurant had a garden beside the lake,
and there were tables and chairs in the garden.

770
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:44,000
People were eating their lunch at the tables.

771
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,910
Fame turned the car into the little car park
by the entrance and stopped.

772
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:51,600
'Come on, Zara,' he said.

773
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,620
'Let's go.'

774
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,180
But Zara didn't move.

775
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,640
She was staring at the car parked next to
them.

776
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,530
'What is it?' asked Fame.

777
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:04,460
'Look at the number,' said Zara.

778
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,950
Fame looked.

779
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,790
ZX 425.

780
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,230
Of course!

781
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:15,030
It was the car in which Zara had been taken
away earlier that day.

782
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,780
'What shall we do?' asked Zara.

783
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,730
'Go and eat,' said Fame.

784
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:20,110
'We're both hungry.'

785
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:24,230
'What about our bald-headed friend?' asked
Zara.

786
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:26,710
'He won't dare do anything in public,' said
Fame.

787
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,670
'Come on.'

788
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,470
So they both went into the garden and sat
down at a table by the edge of the lake and

789
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,260
ordered a meal.

790
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,600
'Can you see him?' asked Fame, as they were
eating.

791
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,830
'Who?' asked Zara.

792
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:42,520
'Our bald-headed friend,' said Fame.

793
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,780
'No,' said Zara, 'he must be inside.'

794
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,660
Both Zara and Fame were very hungry and they
ate a lot.

795
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:56,280
'Well, what are we going to do next?' asked
Fame, as they were drinking coffee.

796
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,760
'You tell me,' said Zara.

797
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,420
'I thought you were the boss,' said Fame.

798
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,220
'I am,' said Zara, smiling, 'but this is your
plan.'

799
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,050
'OK,' said Fame.

800
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:10,620
'Do you remember what was written on the back
of that photograph?'

801
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:16,980
'A letter and a number and a day,' said Zara.
'C...'

802
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,520
'C 304 Monday,' said Fame.

803
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,920
'What does that mean?' asked Zara.

804
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,310
'Well, first of all,' said Fame, 'what happened
on Monday?'

805
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:30,070
'Lots of things,' said Zara.

806
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:33,340
'One particular thing happened,' said Fame.

807
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,340
'Think.'

808
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,340
Zara thought.

809
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,980
'Oh yes,' she said, 'the golden head was stolen.'

810
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,790
'Exactly,' said Fame.

811
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:43,540
And the golden head is supposed to be the
head of the Pharaoh Chef...'

812
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:47,140
'C for Chefren,' said Zara excitedly.

813
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,370
'Exactly,' said Fame again.

814
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:52,960
'The golden head of the Pharaoh which was
stolen.'

815
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,720
'But what about 304?' asked Zara.

816
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,670
'I'm not sure,' said Fame, 'but I can guess.'

817
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,090
'What's your guess?' asked Zara.

818
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:05,010
'I think it's a room number,' said Fame.

819
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:09,970
A room number in a hotel and I only know one
hotel which has so many rooms.'

820
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,640
'Which hotel is that?' asked Zara.

821
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,130
'The Imperial Hotel,' replied Fame.

822
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:19,150
'Ssh!' said Zara suddenly.

823
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:23,100
She was looking past Fame towards the restaurant
building.

824
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,400
Fame turned and looked too.

825
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,180
The baldheaded 'waiter' was coming out into
the garden with two other men.

826
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,460
One of the men was tall and dark and dressed
in a white suit.

827
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,910
He looked Italian.

828
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:37,550
The other man was much shorter and rather
fat.

829
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:42,630
They didn't notice Fame and Zara, but went
and sat down at another table, half hidden

830
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,690
by a tree.

831
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:46,350
'They didn't see us,' said Zara.

832
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:51,490
'But we saw them,' said Fame, 'and we can
watch them closely from here.

833
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,030
Another cup of coffee?'

834
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,770
'Yes please,' said Zara.

835
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,600
And Fame poured Zara another cup of coffee.

836
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:03,070
'Shall we go to the Imperial Hotel?' asked
Zara after a few minutes.

837
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:06,210
'Yes,' said Fame, 'but there's no hurry.

838
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:12,490
I'd like to watch those three men over there
and see what they do.'

839
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:17,270
So Zara and Fame sat in the afternoon sun
by the side of the lake drinking their coffee

840
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,120
and watching the three men.

841
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,250
Zara suddenly turned to Fame and touched his
arm.

842
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:27,560
The bald man and his two friends had finished
their lunch and were crossing the garden towards

843
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,430
the car park.

844
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:32,280
Fame made a sign to Zara to sit still.

845
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,920
They both watched the three men get into their
car and drive slowly off.

846
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,100
Fame paid the bill and he and Zara got into
their car.

847
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,040
They followed the other car into Darna.

848
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,290
When the car reached the town, it turned into
the market and followed the narrow streets

849
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:53,340
down to the main square - Parliament Square.

850
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:58,000
In Parliament Square, the car turned right
and followed a wide street towards the richer

851
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,440
part of town.

852
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,550
This part of town was called The Park, because
of the large public park in the middle of

853
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,550
it.

854
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,110
Along one side of the park, there was an avenue.

855
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:15,180
The avenue was full of hotels, and the largest
of the hotels was The Imperial.

856
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:19,320
The car with the three men in it stopped outside
The Imperial.

857
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:24,380
Fame stopped a little way behind them, in
the shade of some trees.

858
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,780
'Well,' he said to Zara, 'that's interesting.

859
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,480
The Imperial Hotel.'

860
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,320
'Are you going in?' asked Zara.

861
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,700
'Of course,' said Fame, 'but I want you to
stay here.'

862
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,700
'Why?'

863
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,920
asked Zara.

864
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,690
'In case anything happens,' said Fame.

865
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,550
'OK,' said Zara.

866
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,790
'Good luck.'

867
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:50,450
'Thanks,' said Fame and went into the hotel.

868
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:52,710
He went straight up to the reception desk.

869
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:58,050
'Is the gentleman in Room 304 in?' he asked
the porter.

870
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:00,320
The porter looked at the rows of keys behind
him.

871
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,440
'No sir,' he said, 'not yet.

872
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,700
But his friends have just arrived.

873
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,950
They are all up in Room 303, if you want to
go and join them.'

874
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:11,390
Fame hesitated.

875
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:17,510
So the bald-headed man and his two friends
were staying in Room 303, next to Room 304.

876
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:21,190
Who was staying in Room 304?

877
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:23,000
Fame decided to wait.

878
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,190
'No,' said Fame, 'I'll wait here.'

879
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:31,400
Fame went and sat in the far corner of the
foyer, just behind a pillar.

880
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,160
From here, he could see everyone who came
in without being seen.

881
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:41,250
He had been waiting for about five minutes,
when a tall man with a fat pale face and moustache

882
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,750
came in.

883
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,940
Fame knew him immediately.

884
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,990
It was Ezra.

885
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,720
Ezra went up to the desk.

886
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,260
The porter said something and pointed in Fame's
direction.

887
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,130
Fame turned and walked fast out of the foyer
and into the coffee lounge.

888
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,310
He knew the hotel well.

889
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:02,450
At the end of the coffee lounge were some
stairs, which led down to a side door; on

890
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,160
the other side of the door was the street.

891
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,600
'Well,' said Zara as Fame climbed into the
car beside her, 'you weren't long.

892
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,500
Did you find out anything?'

893
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:39,870
'Yes,' said Fame, 'the man staying in Room
304 is Ezra.'

894
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:44,060
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Return Journey

895
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,520
At ten o'clock the next morning, Fame was
driving towards the frontier.

896
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,400
He had left Zara in Darna.

897
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,970
Whatever else happened, it was important for
Fame to attend to his business.

898
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:58,710
This had always been Harker's first rule:
'Keep the business going.

899
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,670
The business must go on.

900
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,260
Business first.'

901
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:08,230
And so Fame crossed the frontier three times
a week, every week of the year on business.

902
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:12,330
Nobody outside Harker's gang knew what that
business was.

903
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:15,470
Even Inspector Roland didn't know, although
he wanted to know.

904
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:19,160
And he had often tried to find out.

905
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,970
At the frontier post, the two customs officers
Silver and Rank were busy.

906
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:27,790
Earlier that morning, they had caught two
men trying to smuggle a large amount of money

907
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,920
across the border.

908
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,710
Silver was writing his report about the smugglers,
when the phone rang.

909
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,370
He picked up the phone.

910
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:38,430
'Hello,' he said, 'Frontier.

911
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:39,820
Silver speaking.'

912
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,060
'Inspector Roland here,' said the voice on
the other end.

913
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:47,100
'Oh hello, Inspector,' said Silver, 'what
can I do for you?'

914
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,370
'Keep your eyes open,' said the Inspector.

915
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,700
'Who for?' asked Silver.

916
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,670
'John Samuel Fame,' said the Inspector.

917
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,690
'Him again?' asked Silver.

918
00:52:58,690 --> 00:52:59,690
'Yes,' said the Inspector.

919
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:02,520
'If he comes through, search his car very
carefully.'

920
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,550
'What are you looking for?' asked Silver.

921
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:09,970
'The golden head of Chefren IV,' said the
Inspector.

922
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,260
Silver whistled.

923
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,860
'Did Fame steal the head?' he asked.

924
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,480
'I don't know,' said the Inspector, 'perhaps.

925
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,410
Anyway, keep your eyes open and search his
car.'

926
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:24,640
'Of course, Inspector,' said Silver.

927
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,040
When Fame arrived at the frontier post about
half an hour later, Silver and Rank were waiting

928
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,040
for him.

929
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,230
'Good morning, Mr Fame,' said Rank.

930
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:34,250
'Going home?'

931
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,860
'Yes,' said Fame.

932
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,360
Anything to declare?' asked Silver.

933
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,860
'Nothing,' said Fame.

934
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:44,470
'We'd like to have a look at your car,' said
Rank.

935
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:46,360
'OK,' said Fame.

936
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,070
And he smiled.

937
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:52,790
For the next hour, Rank and Silver searched
Fame's car.

938
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:57,210
They searched every part of the car twice
and they even took up the carpet inside the

939
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:58,230
car.

940
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:01,640
But they found nothing - or, almost nothing.

941
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:07,290
'Have you had a crash?' asked Rank, pointing
to the side of the car.

942
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:12,370
There was a scratch above one of the wheels
and someone had tried to paint over it.

943
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,680
'No,' said Fame.

944
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,260
'Well, I don't remember this mark before,'
said Rank.

945
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:21,560
'That scratch has always been there,' said
Fame quickly.

946
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,040
Rank looked at Fame.

947
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,030
'All right, Mr Fame, you can go now.

948
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,220
Everything's in order.'

949
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:31,230
'Thank you,' said Fame, 'I'm glad you're satisfied.

950
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,620
See you tomorrow.'

951
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,310
'Are you coming back tomorrow?'

952
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,460
'Oh yes,' said Fame.

953
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,160
'Don't forget to search my car will you?'

954
00:54:39,160 --> 00:55:13,830
And he drove off in a cloud 
of dust.

955
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,380
CHAPTER TWELVE
Ambush

956
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:22,610
Less than twenty-four hours later, Fame was
back at the frontier.

957
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:27,810
Once again, his car was thoroughly searched,
but once again Rank and Silver found nothing.

958
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:31,830
They did not even find the scratch on Fame's
car.

959
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,270
Fame told them he had covered it with paint.

960
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:38,270
Fame left the frontier and drove towards Darna.

961
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:41,670
He was in no hurry and he decided to stop
for a coffee on the way.

962
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:45,310
He knew a small cafe nearby.

963
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:48,550
Fame parked his car outside the cafe and went
in.

964
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:51,970
He ordered a coffee and sat down at a small
table.

965
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:57,080
A radio was playing and Fame sat there listening
to the music.

966
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,700
The cafe was almost empty.

967
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:04,700
The music on the radio stopped and a voice
started to read the news.

968
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,860
Fame had been out of the country for a day.

969
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,990
He was interested in what had happened while
he had been away.

970
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:14,100
Suddenly Fame sat up straight in his chair.

971
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,570
The news on the radio was about Harker.

972
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:21,360
The radio said that the police had just found
the body of a man called Harker.

973
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,930
Fame listened.

974
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:26,660
The news said that Harker's body had been
found in a hut in the forest.

975
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,510
The police thought that Harker had been murdered.

976
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:33,980
Fame finished his coffee quickly and left
the cafe.

977
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:37,560
So now, Inspector Roland knew that Harker
was dead.

978
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:42,110
Don was still a hostage and now the Inspector
would be looking for Fame.

979
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:45,520
Fame decided to drive straight to Zara's house.

980
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,580
So he hurried over to his car, got in and
drove off towards Darna.

981
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,230
It was a beautiful day without a cloud in
the sky.

982
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:58,930
A slight wind moved the tops of the cypress
trees along the straight white road.

983
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:02,870
Fame began to forget his worries as he drove
along under the cypress trees in the morning

984
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:04,950
sun.

985
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:09,400
Fame didn't notice that there was a big blue
car behind him.

986
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,080
The blue car followed Fame for about a kilometer
along the road.

987
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:18,070
Then, just before the road began to climb
into the hills, the blue car pulled out and

988
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:22,990
accelerated past Fame and disappeared round
the bend in front.

989
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:27,560
Fame saw the blue car go past him, but he
was only half - looking at the road.

990
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,440
Above him, hanging in the sky, was a golden
eagle.

991
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:37,400
The eagle was hardly moving - its wings were
spread and still.

992
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,190
Fame slowed the car down and watched.

993
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:45,330
Suddenly the eagle dived towards the ground
and disappeared behind the cypress trees.

994
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:48,150
Then there was a scream of a small animal.

995
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:52,280
The eagle had caught something - a hare perhaps,
or a rat.

996
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,180
Fame drove on.

997
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,790
The road was now climbing and turning through
the hills.

998
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:03,350
On the other side of the hills was the valley
and the lake and the town of Darna.

999
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:07,290
Near the highest point of the road, Fame saw
a sign at the side of the road as he came

1000
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:09,130
round a comer.

1001
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:14,220
The sign had one word written on it: SLOW.

1002
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,320
Fame slowed down.

1003
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,230
Someone must be working on the road, mending
it.

1004
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,520
Fame couldn't see anybody.

1005
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,970
The ground on the left side of the road climbed
steeply to some trees; on the right, it fell

1006
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:28,230
steeply into the valley.

1007
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:33,870
The road itself was narrower than anywhere
else between the frontier and Darna.

1008
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:36,170
Suddenly Fame heard a shot.

1009
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:39,130
There was a loud noise very close to him and
then another.

1010
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,800
Someone was shooting at Fame's car.

1011
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,640
Fame tried to accelerate but the car was out
of control.

1012
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,880
Fame tried to keep the car on the road.

1013
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,790
Bullets were hitting the car from all sides.

1014
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:55,700
Then there was a loud crack, and the windscreen
broke into hundreds of pieces of glass.

1015
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,120
Fame could see nothing.

1016
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:02,360
Fame put the brakes on as hard as he could
and felt the car slide to the left, then to

1017
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,530
the right.

1018
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:07,250
Then the car turned a complete circle and
stopped.

1019
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,310
Fame opened the door and ran.

1020
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,980
Then the shooting stopped.

1021
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:15,400
Fame jumped over the edge of the road and
rolled down the slope.

1022
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,420
Over and over he went until he reached the
bottom.

1023
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,930
There were some bushes at the bottom of the
slope and Fame pulled himself into the middle

1024
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,070
of them.

1025
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:27,140
He lay there, breathing heavily.

1026
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:30,040
From above him, Fame heard a voice.

1027
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,460
It was Ezra's voice.

1028
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:37,690
'All right, Fame, we've got you,' shouted
Ezra.

1029
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:51,440
'Come out of those bushes with your hands
up.'

1030
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,570
CHAPTER THIRTTEN
Another Journey

1031
00:59:56,570 --> 01:00:01,560
Fame got up, put his hands above his head,
and came out of the bushes.

1032
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,360
He looked up.

1033
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,540
Ezra was looking down at him from the top
of the slope.

1034
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:10,470
Next to Ezra was the bald-headed 'waiter'
with the scar.

1035
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:13,270
There were also two other men.

1036
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:16,810
Fame and Zara had seen these two men at the
lakeside restaurant.

1037
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:20,460
One was tall and dark, the other was short
and fat.

1038
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:25,670
'Well, Fame,' said Ezra, 'nice to see you
again.'

1039
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:27,100
Fame said nothing.

1040
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:31,200
'Go down and search him, boys,' said Ezra.

1041
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,230
The tall dark man and the short fat man came
down the slope towards Fame, while the bald-headed

1042
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:38,740
man pointed his gun at him.

1043
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:42,710
Fame kept his hands up while the two men searched
his pockets.

1044
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:47,380
'He hasn't got a gun, Boss,' said the tall
dark man.

1045
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:50,750
Fame recognized the voice; he had heard it
somewhere.

1046
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,470
It was a high voice with an Italian accent.

1047
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:57,240
'OK, Guido,' said Ezra, 'tie his hands.'

1048
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:03,290
Guido took a piece of rope from his jacket
pocket and tied Fame's hands behind his back.

1049
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:08,890
Then he and the fat man pushed Fame back up
the slope towards the road.

1050
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:11,650
Fame's car was right in the middle of the
road.

1051
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:17,770
Broken glass from the windscreen lay all-round
the car, and one of the tyres was flat.

1052
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:23,130
'Skull,' said Ezra to the bald man, 'you stay
with his car.

1053
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:25,480
Change the wheel and knock out the rest of
the glass.

1054
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,290
Then follow us.'

1055
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:31,010
'Right, Boss,' said Skull.

1056
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,490
Ezra turned to Fame.

1057
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:35,360
'You're coming along with us,' he said.

1058
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,770
'I've got a few things to ask you.'

1059
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:40,550
Ezra turned and crossed the road.

1060
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:44,990
Guido and the fat man pushed Fame along behind
him.

1061
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:49,850
Ezra walked a little way up the white road
and then turned off down a lane.

1062
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:55,370
The branches of the trees hung low, shutting
out the sun and making the lane dark.

1063
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:58,770
A big blue car was parked there.

1064
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,490
Fame recognized it.

1065
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:05,160
It was the car that had passed him earlier
while he was watching the eagle.

1066
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,460
'Put him in the back, Robert,' said Ezra to
the short fat man.

1067
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:12,000
Robert pushed Fame into the back of the car.

1068
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,400
Then Robert sat on one side of Fame and Guido
sat on the other side.

1069
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,880
Ezra got into the driver's seat and started
the car.

1070
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:24,270
The car moved slowly forward, down the dark
lane under the low hanging trees to the main

1071
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:26,180
road.

1072
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:29,190
Ezra turned left and drove towards Darna.

1073
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:33,720
Looking back, Fame saw that Skull had got
his car to the side of the road and was changing

1074
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,850
the wheel.

1075
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:38,760
They drove steadily towards Darna.

1076
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,760
Ezra didn't seem in a hurry.

1077
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:45,130
A few miles out of Darna, Ezra turned onto
a small road.

1078
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:46,130
Fame knew this road.

1079
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,570
It also led into Darna.

1080
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:51,600
There was less chance of meeting any police
cars on this road.

1081
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:58,550
'Well, Fame,' Ezra said, after a few minutes,
'so you and I are enemies now.'

1082
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,490
Fame said nothing.

1083
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:03,010
'And Harker's dead,' said Ezra.

1084
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:07,330
'So I heard on the radio,' said Fame.

1085
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,340
Ezra looked at Fame in the driving mirror.

1086
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,440
Then he laughed.

1087
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,080
'You heard about Harker's death on the radio,
did you?' said Ezra.

1088
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,410
'Yes,' said Fame.

1089
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:18,180
'It's a bad business.'

1090
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:22,720
A very bad business,' said Ezra and laughed
again.

1091
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,900
Fame looked out of the window.

1092
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,500
They had reached Darna.

1093
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,740
Ezra turned the car into a narrow lane.

1094
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:32,380
The car bumped down the lane until it came
to the last house.

1095
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:33,380
Ezra stopped the car.

1096
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:38,540
'Take him out,' said Ezra to the two men,
'and take him inside.'

1097
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:43,350
'Which room shall we put him in, Boss?' asked
Robert, the fat man.

1098
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:47,510
This was the first time he had spoken, and
Fame recognized the voice immediately.

1099
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:51,320
It was the voice he had heard in Harker's
hut two days ago when he had discovered Harker's

1100
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,710
body.

1101
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,950
And that's where he had heard Guide's voice
too.

1102
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:56,340
Now Fame remembered.

1103
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,980
Guide's voice had an Italian accent.

1104
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,560
Robert's voice was strong and deep.

1105
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,640
'Put him in the cellar, Robert,' said Ezra.

1106
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,560
'We don't want to make him too comfortable,
do we?'

1107
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:22,620
And Ezra laughed again.

1108
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:27,320
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Ezra's Place

1109
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,970
The cellar was not a comfortable room.

1110
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:32,290
It was dark and small.

1111
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:35,840
Guido and Robert pushed Fame inside and locked
the door.

1112
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,120
Fame was alone.

1113
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:43,570
Hundreds of questions raced through Fame's
mind, as he stood in that small dark cellar.

1114
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:45,170
What did Ezra want?

1115
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:46,780
What was Ezra going to do with him?

1116
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,420
What was Zara doing?

1117
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:50,500
Where was Don?

1118
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,120
What was Inspector Roland doing?

1119
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,390
Where was the golden head?

1120
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,050
What did that poem mean?

1121
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:00,310
Fame wanted answers to all these questions.

1122
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:02,570
The door opened and Guido came in.

1123
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:05,619
'The Boss wants to see you,' he said.

1124
01:05:05,619 --> 01:05:06,619
'Upstairs.'

1125
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:10,560
Guido pushed Fame out of the cellar and up
some stone steps.

1126
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,010
At the top of the steps was a door.

1127
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,360
Guido knocked.

1128
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,410
'Come in,' said a voice.

1129
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:22,300
Guido opened the door and pushed Fame inside.

1130
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,619
Fame found himself in a large comfortable
room.

1131
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:29,480
Ezra was sitting behind a large desk with
his back to a large window.

1132
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,600
The window opened out onto a balcony.

1133
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:37,530
On the floor of the room, there was a Persian
carpet and on the walls, there were tall bookshelves

1134
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,380
full of books.

1135
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:42,480
On Ezra's desk, there was a photograph.

1136
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,230
Fame saw that it was the same photograph Inspector
Roland had showed him - the photograph taken

1137
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:49,220
at the museum reception.

1138
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:54,770
'Sit down,' said Ezra, pointing to a chair
in front of the desk.

1139
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:55,770
Fame sat down.

1140
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:58,510
Guido left the room.

1141
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:04,250
'Cigar?' asked Ezra, opening a box of cigars
and holding the box out to Fame.

1142
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,050
'My hands are tied,' said Fame.

1143
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:10,160
'Of course,' said Ezra, 'how stupid of me.

1144
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,910
Guido!' he shouted.

1145
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:15,081
Guido, who had been waiting outside, came
in.

1146
01:06:15,081 --> 01:06:19,310
'Untie his hands,' ordered Ezra.

1147
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:21,400
Guido untied Fame's hands.

1148
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,190
'You may go,' said Ezra to Guido.

1149
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,260
Guido left the room.

1150
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:29,640
'Cigar?' said Ezra again.

1151
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:32,440
'Thank you,' said Fame and took one.

1152
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,960
'Light?' asked Ezra, picking up a cigarette
lighter from the desk and holding it out to

1153
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:37,960
Fame.

1154
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:43,700
'Thank you,' said Fame, leaning forward with
the cigar in his mouth.

1155
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,100
Ezra lit Fame's cigar and sat back in his
chair.

1156
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:51,510
There was a silence while both men smoked
their cigars.

1157
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:56,290
'Now,' said Ezra, after the silence, 'where
is it?'

1158
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:58,570
'Where's what?' asked Fame.

1159
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:00,230
You know,' said Ezra.

1160
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:02,430
'I don't know,' said Fame.

1161
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:05,160
'The head,' said Ezra.

1162
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,880
'Oh, the head,' said Fame.

1163
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,640
'Yes,' said Ezra, 'the head.

1164
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:13,090
The golden head - the golden Egyptian head
from the museum.'

1165
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:16,230
'I don't know,' said Fame, 'I didn't steal
it.'

1166
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:19,630
'I know,' said Ezra, 'I know you didn't steal
it.

1167
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:20,630
Harker stole it.

1168
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:23,010
But you know where it is, don't you?'

1169
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:26,510
'No,' said Fame, 'I don't.'

1170
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:30,150
Ezra took the cigar from his mouth and looked
hard at Fame.

1171
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:33,190
Then he blew some smoke straight into Fame's
face.

1172
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:37,430
'Now, Fame,' he said, 'don't be stupid.'

1173
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,030
'I'm not being stupid,' said Fame.

1174
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:42,760
'I've no idea where the golden head is.'

1175
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:47,200
Ezra put his left hand into his jacket pocket
and pulled out a piece of paper.

1176
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,460
He pushed it across the desk to Fame.

1177
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:53,650
'Have you seen that before?' asked Ezra.

1178
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:56,490
'Yes,' said Fame.

1179
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,900
It was the poem Harker had written to Fame
before he was killed.

1180
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,060
'What does the poem mean?' asked Ezra.

1181
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,200
'I've no idea,' said Fame.

1182
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,510
'Read it aloud,' said Ezra.

1183
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:10,450
So Fame read the poem aloud.

1184
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:15,660
'Well, what does it mean?' asked Ezra again,
when Fame had finished reading the poem.

1185
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:20,040
'I don't know,' said Fame, 'I don't understand
it.'

1186
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,630
Ezra pressed a little button on his desk.

1187
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:25,521
The door behind Fame opened, and Guido and
Robert came in.

1188
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:30,870
'Tie him up again,' said Ezra, pointing to
Fame.

1189
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:35,600
Guido held Fame's hands, pulled them behind
his back, and tied them with the same piece

1190
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,250
of rope.

1191
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:40,609
Robert knocked the cigar out of Fame's mouth.

1192
01:08:40,609 --> 01:08:43,089
Ezra stood up and walked over to the window.

1193
01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:44,940
He turned round and looked at Fame.

1194
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:50,779
'I've been gentle with you so far,' said Ezra,
'but I'm getting a little impatient.'

1195
01:08:50,779 --> 01:08:54,150
'But I don't know any...' began Fame.

1196
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:56,580
'You listen to me,' said Ezra.

1197
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:57,880
He was suddenly angry.

1198
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,120
'Harker and I planned to steal the golden
head together.

1199
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,069
We planned it.

1200
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:06,870
Harker wanted the golden head and I said I'd
help him steal it.

1201
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:08,440
We planned the robbery together.

1202
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:14,140
I agreed to steal the head for Harker and
take it to my room in the Imperial Hotel.

1203
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,770
But we argued.

1204
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:17,690
Harker and I had an argument.

1205
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:23,670
Harker got that head by himself - he got there
before me.'

1206
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:26,100
Ezra paused and wiped his hand over his mouth.

1207
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:30,359
At last, he was telling Fame what had really
happened.

1208
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:33,700
Fame stared at Ezra, waiting for Ezra to continue
his story.

1209
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:38,529
'When I discovered that Harker had stolen
the head; by himself,' continued Ezra, 'I

1210
01:09:38,529 --> 01:09:39,529
was angry.

1211
01:09:39,529 --> 01:09:40,529
Very angry.

1212
01:09:40,529 --> 01:09:44,400
I went to Harker's hut in the forest and we
argued.

1213
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,580
He wouldn't tell me where he had hidden the
head of the Pharaoh.'

1214
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:50,420
'So you killed him,' said Fame simply.

1215
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:53,730
'Shut up,' said Ezra, 'I haven't finished
yet.

1216
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:57,290
We killed Harker, but only after, we had argued.

1217
01:09:57,290 --> 01:10:00,940
I found this poem on Harker's desk, addressed
to you.

1218
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,810
I asked him what it meant.

1219
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:05,060
He wouldn't tell me, but I knew it was important.

1220
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:10,040
I knew that there was a message hidden in
the poem - about the head.

1221
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,650
Harker said that you would understand the
poem.

1222
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:13,650
We argued.

1223
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:15,580
I lost my temper and we killed him.'

1224
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:19,130
'Who do you mean by "we"?' asked Fame.

1225
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:21,510
'Guido, Robert and myself, of course,' said
Ezra.

1226
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:25,540
'We killed Harker, hung him up and then we
left the hut quickly.'

1227
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:29,880
'Why didn't you take the poem with you?' asked
Fame.

1228
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,450
Ezra looked at Robert, who was standing behind
Fame.

1229
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:38,900
'That fool Robert,' said Ezra, 'had the poem,
but he must have dropped it as we were leaving.

1230
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:43,310
When we realized we had lost the poem, Robert
and Guido hurried back to Harker's hut to

1231
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:45,670
look for the piece of paper with the poem
on it.

1232
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:48,170
But instead of finding the poem, they found
you.

1233
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:51,440
And you escaped with the poem.'

1234
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,690
Ezra paused.

1235
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:56,310
He was now red in the face and breathing hard.

1236
01:10:56,310 --> 01:11:01,630
Fame sat still in his chair, and Guido and
Robert stood behind him.

1237
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:04,270
Outside the house, a car stopped.

1238
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:07,940
Fame heard the sound and realized that it
was his car.

1239
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:10,130
Skull had returned.

1240
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:11,390
Then Fame spoke.

1241
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:13,990
'Now you have the poem,' said Fame.

1242
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,630
'Why do you need me?'

1243
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:20,280
'We need you,' said Ezra to Fame, 'because
you understand the poem.

1244
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,740
I'll give you one more chance to tell me what
the poem means.

1245
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:25,210
Where is the golden head?

1246
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:28,000
What does the poem say?'

1247
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,090
Fame said nothing.

1248
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:33,690
'What does the poem say?' asked Ezra again.

1249
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,920
Fame still said nothing.

1250
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:51,610
Then Robert hit him.

1251
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:56,070
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Escape

1252
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:59,540
Fame didn't remember afterwards how many times
they hit him.

1253
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:02,620
He heard Ezra's voice asking the same question.

1254
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,430
But he said nothing.

1255
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:05,540
Ezra was very angry.

1256
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,770
He started shouting.

1257
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:09,170
'Take him back to the cellar!'

1258
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:10,170
shouted Ezra.

1259
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:11,260
'Leave him there for the night!

1260
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,370
Bring him back here in the morning!

1261
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:15,920
Take him away!'

1262
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,430
So Fame was taken out and carried down the
steps to the cellar.

1263
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:23,690
Guido and Robert threw him inside and locked
the door.

1264
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:26,050
For a long time, Fame lay on the cellar floor.

1265
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:30,980
There were several cuts on his head, and his
back and shoulders ached.

1266
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:33,690
Fame fell asleep.

1267
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:36,000
It was early evening when he finally woke.

1268
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,940
With difficulty, Fame stood up and walked
towards the window.

1269
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:44,270
His face and shoulders still ached and there
was dry blood on his shirt.

1270
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:47,230
But he felt quite calm and his head was very
clear.

1271
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:50,910
Fame thought about Ezra's story.

1272
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:54,750
He now knew for certain who had killed Harker
and why.

1273
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:59,480
Ezra and his men had killed Harker, because
Harker had stolen the golden head.

1274
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:03,450
Harker had stolen the head, without telling
Ezra where he had hidden it.

1275
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:09,790
If Fame could understand the poem, he could
learn where Harker had hidden the golden head.

1276
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:12,520
Fame had to learn the meaning of the poem.

1277
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:16,630
But first he must untie his hands and escape
from Ezra.

1278
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:18,910
Fame looked round the cellar.

1279
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:23,250
In one corner, there were a few broken chairs
and some wooden boxes.

1280
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:26,620
Near the boxes was an old iron bed.

1281
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:28,260
Fame walked across the cellar to the bed.

1282
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:32,890
He knelt on the stone floor with his back
to the bed.

1283
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:37,220
Then he moved his arms against the side of
the bed until the rope around his hands was

1284
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:40,860
right against the sharp comer of the iron
frame.

1285
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:47,380
Then Fame began to rub the rope against the
frame, slowly at first, then faster.

1286
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:51,130
After about five minutes, the rope began to
break.

1287
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:55,000
Fame rubbed harder and a moment later, the
rope broke.

1288
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,400
His hands were free.

1289
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,270
Slowly Fame moved his arms round to the front.

1290
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:04,770
His fingers were so stiff that he could hardly
move them, and there were deep white marks

1291
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:07,989
on his wrists where the ropes had been.

1292
01:14:07,989 --> 01:14:11,960
Fame picked up one of the broken chairs and
carried it over to the window.

1293
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:16,420
He put the chair against the wall under the
window, and stood rather unsteadily on it.

1294
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:19,190
Now he could see through the window.

1295
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:20,400
He was looking into a yard.

1296
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,160
In the middle of the yard was his car.

1297
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,739
Someone had mended the windscreen.

1298
01:14:25,739 --> 01:14:30,610
Skull, the baldheaded man, was standing beside
the car.

1299
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:32,540
It was now nearly dark.

1300
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:38,510
The sun had gone and Fame could hear the evening
noises beginning - insects, children playing,

1301
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:41,960
and the noise of plates as someone prepared
supper.

1302
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,730
Fame decided to wait until it was completely
dark.

1303
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:47,440
He looked at the window.

1304
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:51,460
It was small but it was the only way out of
the cellar.

1305
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:56,050
The window had a wooden frame and wire had
been nailed to the frame.

1306
01:14:56,050 --> 01:15:01,180
Fame got down from the chair and felt on the
floor for a tool to pull off the wire.

1307
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:05,239
In the darkness, his hands felt something
cold and hard.

1308
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:08,330
It was a large bent nail.

1309
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:10,880
Fame got back on the chair and looked out
again.

1310
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,340
Skull had disappeared.

1311
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:18,630
Very gently, Fame pushed the nail under the
wire and began to pull the wire away from

1312
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:20,320
the frame.

1313
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:25,180
It was slow work but after about quarter of
an hour, Fame had pulled one corner of the

1314
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,540
wire back from the frame.

1315
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,880
Fame worked on.

1316
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,940
It was not completely dark.

1317
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:34,800
There was one dim light in the yard.

1318
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,690
Someone came out of a door and crossed the
yard.

1319
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:40,630
Fame saw his face as he passed under the light.

1320
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:42,920
It was Ezra.

1321
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,210
It took Fame about an hour to pull off the
wire.

1322
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:49,711
Once he heard footsteps coming up to the cellar
door, but nobody came in.

1323
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:54,920
Then Fame could hear laughter from one of
the rooms across the yard.

1324
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,670
Ezra and his men must be having supper.

1325
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:03,090
When Fame had removed the wire, he put his
head through the window and looked out.

1326
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:05,320
There was no one in the yard.

1327
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,710
He pulled his head back in and waited a moment.

1328
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,070
All was quiet.

1329
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:13,430
He started to go through the window but it
wasn't easy.

1330
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:15,150
The window was small.

1331
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:23,700
But Fame pushed and turned his body until
at last he was through the window.

1332
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:26,590
As soon as he was in the yard, Fame went to
his car.

1333
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:29,270
He looked inside.

1334
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:32,210
To his surprise, Skull had left the keys in
the car.

1335
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:37,480
Fame was about to get in, when a door opened
and two men came into the yard.

1336
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,630
Fame dropped down and lay flat on the ground
beside the car.

1337
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:48,000
'Well now,' said a voice, 'I think it's time
we asked our friend Fame some more questions.'

1338
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,020
It was Ezra's voice.

1339
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,850
'Shall I go and get him, Boss?'

1340
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,820
It was Guide's voice.

1341
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,040
'OK,' said Ezra.

1342
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,170
'Bring him up to my room.'

1343
01:16:57,170 --> 01:17:00,670
'Right, Boss,' said Guido.

1344
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:03,250
Both men moved away.

1345
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,930
Fame did not wait.

1346
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:08,750
He jumped into the car, turned the key to
start the engine and accelerated out of the

1347
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,170
yard.

1348
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:11,980
There were shouts behind him.

1349
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:16,440
Looking in the mirror, Fame saw that both
Ezra and Guido, the Italian, were running.

1350
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:19,640
Fame accelerated down the narrow street.

1351
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:24,200
He was in a poor part of town, where all the
streets were narrow and badly lit.

1352
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,630
There was no traffic and there were few people
in the streets.

1353
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:32,450
Fame looked in the mirror again and saw that
the big blue car was following him.

1354
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:36,710
Ezra was driving the blue car and Guido was
sitting beside him.

1355
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:39,960
Fame drove fast but he didn't know the streets.

1356
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,760
Ezra did.

1357
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,220
Slowly the blue car came nearer to him.

1358
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:47,900
Fame turned his car into another sloping narrow
street.

1359
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:51,110
Both cars were going very fast.

1360
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,570
Suddenly Fame saw that there was a wall ahead.

1361
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:55,340
The street had no exit.

1362
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:58,020
There was no way out.

1363
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,920
Fame put on the brakes to stop the car.

1364
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,610
The tyres screamed on the dry road and the
car moved wildly from left to right and then

1365
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:06,870
came to a stop.

1366
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:10,600
Fame pulled the keys out of the car and jumped
out.

1367
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,410
To his left, there was an opening in the wall.

1368
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:15,510
Beyond it was another street.

1369
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:33,270
Fame ran through the opening.

1370
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:37,860
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Trapped!

1371
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:43,180
In front of Fame was a high wall; behind him
were Ezra and Guido.

1372
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:46,120
Fame could hear Ezra and Guido shouting behind
him.

1373
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:50,770
They were following him through the opening
and down the narrow street.

1374
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:54,440
Fame turned right suddenly and ran back down
a very small path.

1375
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:59,820
There were no lights at all in the path and
once he fell over a broken box lying against

1376
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:01,940
the wall.

1377
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:06,360
At the end of the path, there were some steps,
which dropped into the darkness.

1378
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:10,660
As Fame ran down the steps, he fell over onto
the stone pavement at the bottom.

1379
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:14,870
By now, Ezra and Guido had reached the top
of the steps.

1380
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:18,920
Fame couldn't see them, but he could hear
them shouting to each other.

1381
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,000
Fame got up and ran on.

1382
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,960
He couldn't see anything in front of him and
there was a sharp pain in his left leg, but

1383
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,590
he had to keep going.

1384
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:31,880
After about another ten metres, he suddenly
saw the black shape of a wall in front of

1385
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,900
him.

1386
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:37,290
He saw the wall too late and ran straight
into it.

1387
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:38,840
Fame was trapped.

1388
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,510
There was no way that he could escape.

1389
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:45,500
On one side of him was a high wall; on the
other side were Ezra and Guido.

1390
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:51,250
The wall was too high to climb, and Fame could
find no door or window that led through it.

1391
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:54,290
He turned to face Ezra and Guido.

1392
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:58,770
He could hear them both breathing, only a
few metres away.

1393
01:19:58,770 --> 01:19:59,820
'Fame!

1394
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:01,380
Where are you?'

1395
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,500
called Ezra.

1396
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,380
'We're coming to get you,' said Guido.

1397
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:07,719
'You can't escape now.'

1398
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:10,860
So far, Ezra and Guido hadn't seen Fame.

1399
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:14,540
They were both coming forward very slowly
towards the wall.

1400
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:16,190
Fame moved a little to his left.

1401
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:20,500
As he did so, he felt a piece of metal in
the wall.

1402
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,010
It was a door handle.

1403
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:27,520
Very gently, Fame turned the handle and silently
opened the door.

1404
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,950
He opened the door wide enough to slip through.

1405
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:35,670
Then, quick as a cat, he closed the door behind
him and felt to see if there was a key.

1406
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:39,980
There was a large key and Fame turned it to
lock the door.

1407
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:43,990
He heard an angry shout from Ezra, on the
other side of the wall.

1408
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:46,730
Fame had escaped.

1409
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:48,460
Fame seemed to be in a garden.

1410
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:52,420
There was a smell of lemons and he could just
see the shape of a large bush to the left

1411
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:53,860
of the door.

1412
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:58,920
In the distance, there was a light and Fame
began to move slowly towards it.

1413
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,710
He was walking on soft earth and the smell
of lemons was very strong.

1414
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:07,840
The light was coming from the window of a
house, and Fame could see the dark shape of

1415
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,239
the building against the sky.

1416
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:15,850
He walked carefully on until he had reached
the side of the house just below the window.

1417
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:19,080
There was a pile of boxes directly under the
window.

1418
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,890
Fame reached up to pull himself on top of
the pile so that he could look through the

1419
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:24,630
window.

1420
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:28,840
As he was pulling himself up, Fame knocked
one of the boxes with his knee.

1421
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:34,780
The whole pile of boxes fell to the ground
and Fame fell with them.

1422
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:38,630
Almost immediately, Fame heard voices coming
towards him.

1423
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:42,940
Suddenly someone shone a torch on Fame as
he lay among the broken boxes.

1424
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:45,690
Then Fame heard a voice that he knew very
well.

1425
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:48,670
'Well, Mr Fame,' said the voice.

1426
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,470
'What a surprise to see you.

1427
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:54,750
Welcome to police headquarters.'

1428
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:57,780
Fame looked up from the pile of boxes on the
ground.

1429
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:29,730
Looking down at him was Inspector Roland.

1430
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:33,650
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Plans

1431
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:35,320
Fame picked himself up.

1432
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:39,150
'Hello, Inspector,' he said, 'I've come to
see you.'

1433
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:41,860
'So I see,' said Inspector Roland.

1434
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:42,860
'Are you staying?'

1435
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:46,340
'If you want me to,' said Fame.

1436
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:47,710
Inspector Roland smiled.

1437
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:51,090
'You're staying,' said the Inspector.

1438
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:56,219
And two policemen took Fame by the arms and
led him into the police headquarters.

1439
01:22:56,219 --> 01:23:00,480
Fame was led into a large room with a lot
of maps on one wall and a very large painting

1440
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,730
of the president on the opposite wall.

1441
01:23:02,730 --> 01:23:06,400
In the middle of the room was a long table
with eight chairs round it.

1442
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:11,610
'Sit down, Fame,' said Inspector Roland pointing
to one of the chairs.

1443
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:12,610
Fame sat down.

1444
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:14,170
So did the others.

1445
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:19,170
Apart from Inspector Roland, there were three
other people in the room - two policemen and

1446
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:21,230
a woman holding a notebook.

1447
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:24,820
'Well,' said Inspector Roland cheerfully,
looking at Fame.

1448
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,830
'And where have you been?'

1449
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:28,510
'Here and there,' said Fame.

1450
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:31,200
'Doing what?' asked the Inspector.

1451
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,910
'Thinking,' said Fame.

1452
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:35,380
'Did you find Harker?' asked the Inspector.

1453
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:37,690
'Harker's dead,' said Fame.

1454
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:39,710
'I know,' said Inspector Roland.

1455
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:41,340
'Did you kill him?'

1456
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,730
'No,' said Fame, 'but I know who did.

1457
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:45,730
Ezra.

1458
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:48,540
Ezra and his men killed Harker.'

1459
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:49,620
There was a silence.

1460
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:56,890
'Do you want to tell us what happened?' said
the Inspector.

1461
01:23:56,890 --> 01:23:59,940
Fame began to tell the Inspector what had
happened.

1462
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:03,940
He told Inspector Roland about the hut in
the forest, the argument between Harker and

1463
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:08,070
Ezra, and about Harker's plan to steal the
golden head.

1464
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:12,650
He told the Inspector how Harker had stolen
the head and how Ezra, Guido and Robert had

1465
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:15,230
killed him.

1466
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:17,800
Inspector Roland listened to Fame's story.

1467
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:22,170
Then Fame told the Inspector how Ezra and
his men had captured him and asked him many

1468
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:23,270
questions.

1469
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:25,680
Fame explained how he had escaped from Ezra.

1470
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:29,570
'I see,' said Inspector Roland when Fame had
finished.

1471
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:34,260
'Very interesting, but there's something else
I'd like to know - something you haven't told

1472
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:35,260
me.'

1473
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:36,850
'What's that?' asked Fame.

1474
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:37,989
'Where the head is.

1475
01:24:37,989 --> 01:24:39,610
The golden head.

1476
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:43,790
Where is the golden head of the Pharaoh, stolen
from the museum by Harker?'

1477
01:24:43,790 --> 01:24:47,480
'I don't know where it is,' said Fame.

1478
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,830
Inspector Roland leant forward.

1479
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:52,390
'Look, Fame,' he said, 'you're an intelligent
man.

1480
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:54,239
I'm an intelligent man.

1481
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:55,700
Let's not play games.'

1482
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:58,800
'What do you mean?' said Fame.

1483
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:03,430
'Listen,' said the Inspector, 'I know you
worked for Harker and I know Ezra worked for

1484
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:04,430
Harker.

1485
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:06,340
Harker had a gang, didn't he?'

1486
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:07,630
'Yes,' said Fame.

1487
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:12,219
'Now I've been trying to catch Harker and
his gang for a long time.

1488
01:25:12,219 --> 01:25:16,870
You and he and the gang have been smuggling
for years, haven't you?'

1489
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:18,170
'Well...' said Fame.

1490
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:20,170
'Yes you have,' said the Inspector.

1491
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,500
'I know you have.

1492
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,920
But I don't know what you've been smuggling.

1493
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,770
But if you don't help me, you and your friends
are going to go to prison.'

1494
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:30,410
'What for?' asked Fame.

1495
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:34,380
'For stealing the golden head of the Pharaoh
Chefren IV.'

1496
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:36,300
'But...' began Fame.

1497
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:39,260
'You could never prove that we stole the head.

1498
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:40,540
You know we didn't steal it.

1499
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:42,980
I've told you that Harker stole the head.'

1500
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:47,290
'I think I could prove that you stole the
head,' said Inspector Roland.

1501
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:50,190
'There's a lot of evidences against you.'

1502
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:51,660
Fame was silent.

1503
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:52,660
It was true.

1504
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:55,010
There was a lot of evidence against him.

1505
01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:57,140
He was Harker's most important man.

1506
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:59,190
He had the mysterious poem.

1507
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:03,940
He had had an appointment with Harker the
night Harker was killed...

1508
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:07,980
Inspector Roland took a piece of paper off
the desk and showed it to Fame.

1509
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:11,020
Fame immediately recognized what was written
on the paper.

1510
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:12,620
It was Harker's poem.

1511
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:15,980
'Where did you get this?' asked Fame.

1512
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:18,390
'From your friend,' said Inspector Roland.

1513
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:20,640
'Which friend?' asked Fame.

1514
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,469
'Your girlfriend,' said the Inspector.

1515
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:26,760
'Zara?' asked Fame, amazed.

1516
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,360
'Zara,' said the Inspector.

1517
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:33,760
As he spoke, the Inspector picked up a small
silver bell from the table and rang it.

1518
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:57,480
Almost immediately, the door opened and Zara
and Don came in, followed by a policeman.

1519
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,580
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
The Poem

1520
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:03,930
'Zara!' said Fame.

1521
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:05,989
'Hello, Fame,' said Zara.

1522
01:27:05,989 --> 01:27:08,489
'Hello, Fame,' said Don.

1523
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:10,890
'Hello, Don,' said Fame.

1524
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:16,260
'Well,' said Inspector Roland, 'now you've
all met, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

1525
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:21,110
I'm going to leave you in this room with two
of my men to guard you, and...' he held up

1526
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:24,590
Harker's poem, 'with this piece of paper.

1527
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:29,150
Now, I'll give you until morning to tell me
the meaning of this poem.

1528
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:33,340
If you work it out and tell me where the golden
head is hidden, you'll be free.

1529
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:38,390
If you don't work it out, you'll be charged
with stealing the golden head of the Pharaoh

1530
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:39,390
Chefren IV.'

1531
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:42,010
'But we didn't steal it,' said Zara.

1532
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:46,620
'There's a lot of evidence against you,' said
Inspector Roland, smiling.

1533
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:51,110
Then he left the room while the two policemen
stayed behind.

1534
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:55,080
Zara, Fame and Don looked at each other.

1535
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:58,500
'Well,' said Zara, 'let's have a look at the
poem.'

1536
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:01,010
Fame picked up the piece of paper.

1537
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:03,060
Fame read it out:

1538
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:04,060
Great men

1539
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:06,570
Do not walk easy roads.

1540
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:07,870
Tall men

1541
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:09,739
Strain under heavy loads.

1542
01:28:09,739 --> 01:28:12,040
They bend beneath the weight,

1543
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,250
Get tired beneath the load.

1544
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:17,000
They go in pain and hate.

1545
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,060
They wander down that road,

1546
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:22,030
But then against the watt they stand

1547
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:26,910
And near one rock, they rest their hand.

1548
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:30,090
When Fame had read the poem, he looked at
Don and Zara.

1549
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:31,620
'Well?' he asked.

1550
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:33,120
'It's nonsense,' said Don.

1551
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,620
'It doesn't mean anything.'

1552
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,300
'It's a poem,' said Zara.

1553
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:37,620
'It means a lot.'

1554
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,650
'It's more than a poem,' said Fame.

1555
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:41,070
'There's a message in it.'

1556
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:43,230
'What message?' asked Don.

1557
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:45,350
'I don't know,' said Fame.

1558
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:47,560
'Let's try and find out.'

1559
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:48,890
'How?' asked Zara.

1560
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:50,219
'Well,' said Fame.

1561
01:28:50,219 --> 01:28:54,470
'Let's look at the letters at the beginning
of each line.'

1562
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:58,200
Fame took another piece of paper from his
pocket and wrote down the letters at the beginning

1563
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:01,210
of each line.

1564
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:03,650
GDTSTGTTBA

1565
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:08,300
'What does that spell?' asked Don.

1566
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:09,969
'Nothing,' said Zara.

1567
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:13,600
'Let's try the letters the other way round,'
said Fame.

1568
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,500
'How do you mean?' said Don.

1569
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:22,370
'Like this,' said Fame, and he wrote the letters
backwards:

1570
01:29:22,370 --> 01:29:25,240
ABTTGTSTDG

1571
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:30,590
'What does that spell?' asked Don.

1572
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:32,530
'Nothing,' said Zara.

1573
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:35,190
'OK,' said Fame, 'let's try something else.

1574
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:40,610
Let's take the first letter of the first line,
and the last letter of the second line...

1575
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:41,610
and soon...'

1576
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:44,700
'How do you mean?' asked Don.

1577
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:49,610
'Like this,' said Fame, and he wrote down:

1578
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:51,969
GSTSTDTDBD

1579
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:56,910
'What does that spell?' asked Don.

1580
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:58,940
'Nothing,' said Zara.

1581
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:03,160
'Try the letters the other way round,' said
Fame.

1582
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:08,290
And this time Don wrote them down:

1583
01:30:08,290 --> 01:30:12,030
DBDTDTSTSG

1584
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:14,560
'It still doesn't spell anything,' said Zara.

1585
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,800
'I know,' said Fame.

1586
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,030
'It's nonsense,' said Don.

1587
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:21,730
Fame shook his head.

1588
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:25,640
The two policemen were watching them from
the other end of the room.

1589
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:29,160
'I've got an idea,' said Zara suddenly.

1590
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:35,600
'Take the first letter of the first line and
the second letter of the second line, and

1591
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:36,600
so on.'

1592
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,110
'How do you mean?' asked Don.

1593
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:40,780
'Like this,' said Zara.

1594
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:43,960
'Fame, what's the first letter of the first
line?'

1595
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,550
'G,' said Fame.

1596
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:49,210
'And the second letter of the second line?'
asked Zara.

1597
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:50,410
'O,' said Fame.

1598
01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:53,130
'And the third letter of the third line?'

1599
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:54,130
'L.'

1600
01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:56,300
'And the fourth letter of the fourth line?'

1601
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:57,300
'A.'

1602
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,239
'And the fifth letter of the fifth line?'

1603
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:01,630
'B.'

1604
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:04,180
'And the sixth letter of the sixth line?'

1605
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:05,380
'R.'

1606
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:07,680
'And the seventh letter of the seventh line?'

1607
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:08,680
'I.'

1608
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,670
'And the eighth letter of the eighth line?'

1609
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:11,940
'D,' said Fame.

1610
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:14,890
'And the ninth letter of the ninth line?'

1611
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:15,989
'G.'

1612
01:31:15,989 --> 01:31:18,400
'And the tenth letter of the tenth line?'

1613
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,370
'E,' said Fame.

1614
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:23,450
'What does that spell?' asked Don.

1615
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:24,850
He was laughing.

1616
01:31:24,850 --> 01:31:31,030
'Let's see,' said Fame.

1617
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:35,590
GOLABRIDGE

1618
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:37,380
Fame looked at Zara.

1619
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:38,489
She was looking at Fame.

1620
01:31:38,489 --> 01:31:42,520
She was going to shout but Fame stopped Zara
from shouting.

1621
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:46,520
They had discovered the message hidden in
the poem, but Fame didn't want the policemen

1622
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,930
to know.

1623
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:49,280
Fame made a sign.

1624
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:54,590
'Oh dear, it doesn't spell anything,' he said
loudly.

1625
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:56,570
He looked at the two policemen.

1626
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:58,530
They weren't even looking.

1627
01:31:58,530 --> 01:32:01,719
'Gola Bridge,' whispered Zara.

1628
01:32:01,719 --> 01:32:05,660
'So that's the message in the poem.'

1629
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:12,580
'Gola Bridge,' whispered Don, 'of course,
the bridge over the River Gola, not far from

1630
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:14,610
my hideout.'

1631
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:19,469
'So that's where the head's hidden,' whispered
Fame.

1632
01:32:19,469 --> 01:32:21,739
Fame looked at the policemen again.

1633
01:32:21,739 --> 01:32:25,239
One of them was looking out of the window
and the other was yawning.

1634
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:27,190
Fame looked at Zara.

1635
01:32:27,190 --> 01:32:28,590
Zara nodded.

1636
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:31,460
She understood what Fame wanted to do next.

1637
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:33,000
She coughed.

1638
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
The two policemen looked at her.

1639
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,660
'Excuse me,' said Zara.

1640
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:41,450
'What do you want?' asked one of the policemen.

1641
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:43,820
'I'd like a drink of water,' said Zara.

1642
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:44,920
'I'm thirsty.'

1643
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:47,280
'All right,' said the policeman.

1644
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,719
'I'll get you a drink of water.'

1645
01:32:49,719 --> 01:32:53,110
And he went out of the room to get a glass
of water for Zara.

1646
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:56,320
There was now only one policeman in the room.

1647
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,770
'Excuse me,' said Fame to the policeman.

1648
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:01,780
'What do you want?' said the policeman.

1649
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:04,060
'We want some help,' said Fame.

1650
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:06,850
'What with?' asked the policeman.

1651
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:09,040
'This poem,' said Fame.

1652
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:13,260
'What's the difficulty?' asked the policeman,
coming over to Fame.

1653
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:19,220
'Is this letter a G or a Y?' asked Fame.

1654
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:22,050
The policeman bent over the bit of paper.

1655
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:25,840
Very quickly, Don moved behind the policeman
and hit him hard on the back of the head with

1656
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,280
his open hand.

1657
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,100
The policeman fell onto the floor.

1658
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:33,290
'Quick,' said Don, 'the other policeman will
be back soon.'

1659
01:33:33,290 --> 01:33:38,810
Don stood behind the door and Fame and Zara
stood in front of the fallen policeman.

1660
01:33:38,810 --> 01:33:42,710
The door opened and the other policeman came
in, carrying a glass of water.

1661
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:46,910
'I've brought you your...' said the policeman.

1662
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:49,200
But he didn't finish the sentence.

1663
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,180
Don held him from behind and hit him.

1664
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:54,320
The glass dropped onto the carpet.

1665
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,930
Don caught the policeman as he fell.

1666
01:33:56,930 --> 01:34:00,210
'Into the garden,' said Fame to Don and Zara.

1667
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:04,000
They opened the door into the garden and went
out.

1668
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:25,170
Behind them on the table lay the piece of
paper with 'GOLABRIDGE' written on it.

1669
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:29,500
CHAPTER NINETEEN
The Search

1670
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:35,110
Fame led Zara and Don back through the garden
to the door in the wall and out into the street.

1671
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:38,710
They walked back quietly to where Fame had
left his car.

1672
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:42,130
The moon had come up, lighting the paths and
the streets.

1673
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:44,750
There was no sign of Ezra or Guido.

1674
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:47,020
There was no sign of their car either.

1675
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:49,150
But Fame's car was still there.

1676
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:53,340
Zara, Don and Fame got into the car quickly.

1677
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:58,910
Fame backed the car up the narrow street,
turned, and drove out of Darna.

1678
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:00,810
Zara and Don didn't ask where they were going.

1679
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:03,540
They knew where they were going.

1680
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:07,290
The moon was shining brightly and it was a
warm night.

1681
01:35:07,290 --> 01:35:10,850
Fame drove fast through the empty streets
and into the country.

1682
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:15,199
They passed the turn to Don's hideout and
then Fame turned the car off the main road

1683
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:17,260
and down a lane.

1684
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:21,080
After about two kilometres, they heard the
sound of running water.

1685
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:25,430
It was the sound of the Gola river running
down to Lake Darna.

1686
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:29,280
Fame stopped the car before the bridge and
the three of them looked out.

1687
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:33,469
They could see the huge black shape of the
Gola Bridge in front of them.

1688
01:35:33,469 --> 01:35:37,489
Above them on one side of the road, was a
steep hill.

1689
01:35:37,489 --> 01:35:40,660
On the other side, was a steep drop down to
the river.

1690
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:42,969
'We're here,' said Fame.

1691
01:35:42,969 --> 01:35:44,680
They looked at the bridge.

1692
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:49,280
'Where do we begin the search?' asked Zara,
'The bridge is so big.'

1693
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:54,239
'I don't think the head is hidden on the bridge
at all,' said Fame.

1694
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:57,390
'Where is it hidden then?' asked Don.

1695
01:35:57,390 --> 01:36:00,230
'Look at the poem again,' said Fame.

1696
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:01,880
He took the poem out of his pocket.

1697
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:04,890
Then he got a torch from the car and switched
it on.

1698
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:07,340
They all looked at the poem.

1699
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:10,489
'Right,' said Fame, 'listen.

1700
01:36:10,489 --> 01:36:14,739
Zara discovered the most important thing:
the words "Gola Bridge".

1701
01:36:14,739 --> 01:36:19,160
But the bridge is very big and there's nowhere
very safe to hide the head.

1702
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:22,860
I think the head is somewhere very near the
bridge.

1703
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,400
Now there are some clues in the poem.

1704
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,400
Listen:

1705
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,930
'"Great men Do not walk easy roads."'

1706
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:32,350
'What does that mean?' asked Don.

1707
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:36,620
'You know the old quarry up there on the hillside,
don't you?' asked Fame.

1708
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:39,239
'Of course I do,' replied Don.

1709
01:36:39,239 --> 01:36:41,980
'My father used to work in the quarry.'

1710
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:46,870
'Well,' said Fame, 'the path to the quarry
is rough and difficult, isn't it?'

1711
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:49,380
'Yes, it is,' Don agreed.

1712
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:53,810
'And the workers who went up and down to the
quarry carried heavy loads, didn't they?'

1713
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:54,810
asked Fame.

1714
01:36:54,810 --> 01:37:00,380
'That's in the fourth line of the poem: "Strain
under heavy loads.'"

1715
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:04,260
'Then the Pharaoh's head must be hidden in
the quarry,' said Zara.

1716
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:08,850
'Yes, it must be hidden very near the quarry,'
replied Fame.

1717
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:11,199
'But listen to the last two lines of the poem.

1718
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:13,810
There are two more clues in the poem:

1719
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:22,340
"But then against the wall they stand And
near one rock, they rest their hand.'"

1720
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,180
Fame looked up at the others.

1721
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:28,480
They were all silent for a moment and then
Don shouted out.

1722
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:33,070
'I know what the last two lines of the poem
mean,' he shouted.

1723
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:36,530
'The wall is the wall of the quarry.

1724
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:40,920
When you get to the quarry, you come to the
quarry wall, don't you?'

1725
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,140
'Yes, you do,' said Zara.

1726
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:47,330
'And next to the quarry wall there is a large
rock,' said Don.

1727
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:51,520
'In the rock there is a small cave.'

1728
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,280
Don looked at Zara and then at Fame.

1729
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,270
They all smiled.

1730
01:37:56,270 --> 01:38:01,600
So the Pharaoh's head was hidden in the rock,
next to the quarry wall.

1731
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,989
They got out of the car and walked up the
narrow path to the quarry.

1732
01:38:05,989 --> 01:38:09,220
The moon threw the shadows of the bushes across
the path.

1733
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:11,430
It was very quiet.

1734
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:14,750
When they got to the quarry, they walked to
the quarry wall.

1735
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:18,530
They could see the shape of a large rock by
the wall.

1736
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:22,610
'Come on,' said Fame and began to climb up
the side of the rock.

1737
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:25,130
Don and Zara followed him.

1738
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:27,450
The rock was quite easy to climb.

1739
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:30,610
Near the top of the rock was a small cave.

1740
01:38:30,610 --> 01:38:33,110
Fame flashed the torch in the darkness.

1741
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:35,030
Something shone.

1742
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:37,930
Fame ran forward and picked up something.

1743
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:40,080
It was the golden head of the Pharaoh.

1744
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,969
'What are you going to do with it?' asked
Don.

1745
01:38:42,969 --> 01:38:46,800
'Send it to Inspector Roland, of course,'
said Fame.

1746
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,070
'He wants the head.

1747
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:49,170
We don't want it.

1748
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:52,440
We just want to continue with our usual business.

1749
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:55,620
Yes, we'll send the head to Inspector Roland.'

1750
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:59,820
'Oh no, you won't,' said a voice.

1751
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:03,870
It was Ezra, standing just below the rock
with a gun in his hand.

1752
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:08,890
With him were Guido the Italian, fat Robert,
and Skull.

1753
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:24,760
They all had guns.

1754
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:27,110
CHAPTER TWENTY
Shot Dead

1755
01:39:27,110 --> 01:39:31,140
'Come down,' said Ezra.

1756
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:34,440
Fame, Zara and Don came down, carrying the
head.

1757
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:39,500
'I'll take that,' said Ezra, pointing to the
golden head.

1758
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:42,770
Fame gave the head to Ezra, and Ezra smiled.

1759
01:39:42,770 --> 01:39:45,190
'At last,' said Ezra.

1760
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:47,580
'Very clever,' said Fame.

1761
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:50,920
'Yes, it was quite clever, wasn't it?' said
Ezra.

1762
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,940
'We simply followed you here.'

1763
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:54,590
'How?' asked Fame.

1764
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:58,050
'I knew you'd come back to your car,' said
Ezra.

1765
01:39:58,050 --> 01:40:01,719
'We simply waited round the corner until you
did come back.

1766
01:40:01,719 --> 01:40:05,870
Then we drove behind you, parked the car a
little way from the bridge and walked.

1767
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:10,050
We could hear you up by the quarry, so we
followed you up the quarry path.'

1768
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:14,100
'And now, here you are,' said Fame.

1769
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:15,850
'Exactly,' said Ezra.

1770
01:40:15,850 --> 01:40:20,270
'What are you going to do with us?' asked
Fame.

1771
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:27,340
'Well,' said Ezra, 'we don't really need you
anymore, so I think we'll send you on a journey.'

1772
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:30,170
'A journey?' asked Don.

1773
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:31,640
'Yes,' said Ezra.

1774
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,780
'Come with us.'

1775
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:37,220
He pointed with his gun to the path from the
quarry down to the road.

1776
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:40,030
'That way,' he said.

1777
01:40:40,030 --> 01:40:45,320
So Fame, Don, and Zara walked back down the
path followed by Ezra and his men with their

1778
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:46,449
guns.

1779
01:40:46,449 --> 01:40:47,780
When they reached the road,

1780
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:51,630
Fame's car was still parked on the road facing
the bridge.

1781
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:53,410
Ezra whispered something to Guido.

1782
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:57,989
Guido got into Fame's car and turned it across
the road.

1783
01:40:57,989 --> 01:41:02,820
Fame's car now faced the edge of the slope
that dropped steeply down to the river.

1784
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:08,970
'Now,' said Ezra, 'you three are all going
to get into your car, and then you Fame, are

1785
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:11,690
going to drive it over the slope and into
the river.

1786
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:15,660
I hope you can swim, because if not, there'll
be a little accident.'

1787
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:22,590
Ezra smiled; the Italian smiled; Robert smiled;
even Skull smiled.

1788
01:41:22,590 --> 01:41:25,870
Fame, Zara, and Don, didn't smile.

1789
01:41:25,870 --> 01:41:30,290
'Come on,' said Ezra, 'get into the car.'

1790
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:31,980
Fame opened the door slowly.

1791
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:36,230
'Why don't you let us go?' he asked Ezra.

1792
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:39,520
'Because I don't like you,' said Ezra.

1793
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,300
'Get in!'

1794
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:45,050
Fame got into his car and so did Zara and
Don.

1795
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:48,740
In front of them was the steep drop down to
the river.

1796
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:52,320
'Now start the car,' said Ezra.

1797
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,830
Fame started the car.

1798
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:56,380
Below them lay the river.

1799
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:58,780
The moon was reflected in the river.

1800
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:02,370
'Goodbye,' said Ezra, waving at them and smiling.

1801
01:42:02,370 --> 01:42:04,640
'Have a safe...'

1802
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:07,070
But Ezra never finished his sentence.

1803
01:42:07,070 --> 01:42:10,450
Suddenly, there was the sound of a gun up
the lane.

1804
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:13,810
Ezra stood with his mouth open, and one arm
in the air.

1805
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:16,780
Then he turned slowly and fell.

1806
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:20,910
Fame looked down the lane and saw three men
running towards the car.

1807
01:42:20,910 --> 01:42:23,560
Fame recognized the man who was carrying the
gun.

1808
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:26,090
It was Inspector Roland.

1809
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:27,710
Fame did not wait.

1810
01:42:27,710 --> 01:42:32,340
He turned his car back onto the road and accelerated
towards the bridge.

1811
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:36,550
Inspector Roland saw the car race across the
Gola Bridge and disappear.

1812
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:41,980
The Inspector bent down beside the body of
Ezra and quietly picked up the golden head

1813
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:44,330
of the Pharaoh Chefren IV.

1814
01:42:44,330 --> 01:42:47,600
His men were taking away Guido, Robert and
Skull.

1815
01:42:47,600 --> 01:43:13,480
'Well,' said the Inspector to the Pharaoh,
'welcome back.'

1816
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:19,440
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
A Long Time Later

1817
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,510
It was five years later.

1818
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:25,090
Chief Inspector Roland was abroad, on holiday.

1819
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:29,440
He was staying in a small fishing town beside
the sea.

1820
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:33,770
One evening, he was sitting at a cafe table
on the pavement, drinking a cup of coffee

1821
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:35,270
and smoking a cigarette.

1822
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:39,280
He leant back and blew a puff of cigarette
smoke into the sky.

1823
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:42,860
It was a beautiful warm night with a full
moon.

1824
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:45,739
The sky was full of stars.

1825
01:43:45,739 --> 01:43:48,610
He felt very happy.

1826
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:51,150
Inspector Roland shut his eyes...

1827
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:55,290
'Inspector Roland!' said a voice.

1828
01:43:55,290 --> 01:43:58,560
The Inspector opened his eyes.

1829
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,860
Someone was calling him.

1830
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:05,280
Standing on the other side of the cafe table
was John Samuel Fame.

1831
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,760
There was a woman beside him.

1832
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,110
It was Zara.

1833
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:10,370
Inspector Roland stood up.

1834
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:13,920
'Fame,' he said, 'and Zara.'

1835
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:16,170
'Hello, Inspector,' said Zara.

1836
01:44:16,170 --> 01:44:18,800
'Sit down,' said Inspector Roland.

1837
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,290
Please sit down.'

1838
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:26,840
So Fame and Zara sat down, and Inspector Roland
ordered two more coffees, and they talked.

1839
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:32,320
They talked for a long time - into the early
morning - like old friends.

1840
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:37,160
Inspector Roland told them about the golden
head, which was now safe in the Darna museum,

1841
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:42,850
and about Guido and Robert and Skull, just
out of prison and now leading honest lives.

1842
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:47,850
The Inspector told them about Harker and Ezra,
buried side by side in the hill cemetery above

1843
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:49,450
Darna.

1844
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:53,940
Fame and Zara told the Inspector about their
marriage, about their two children, about

1845
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:59,690
their house and garden and their happiness
together.

1846
01:44:59,690 --> 01:45:02,460
It was one o'clock in the morning when Fame
looked at his watch.

1847
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:05,719
'We must go,' he said to Zara.

1848
01:45:05,719 --> 01:45:07,239
'I'm tired.'

1849
01:45:07,239 --> 01:45:08,710
They both stood up.

1850
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:14,430
'Goodbye, Inspector,' said Fame, shaking hands,
'it's been wonderful meeting you again.'

1851
01:45:14,430 --> 01:45:16,840
'I've enjoyed it,' said the Inspector smiling.

1852
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:18,140
'Goodbye, Zara.'

1853
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:20,480
'Goodbye, Inspector,' said Zara.

1854
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,320
And she smiled.

1855
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,670
They turned and started to walk down the street.

1856
01:45:25,670 --> 01:45:27,490
Inspector Roland watched them.

1857
01:45:27,490 --> 01:45:29,260
Then he remembered.

1858
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:32,570
'Fame!' he shouted.

1859
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:34,440
Fame stopped and turned.

1860
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:36,400
'Yes?' he said.

1861
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,070
'One question,' said the Inspector.

1862
01:45:39,070 --> 01:45:44,810
'What were you smuggling all those years,
when you worked for Harker?'

1863
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:46,660
There was a silence.

1864
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:48,160
Fame looked at Zara.

1865
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:49,570
She nodded.

1866
01:45:49,570 --> 01:45:51,480
Fame turned to the Inspector again.

1867
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:53,260
'Cars,' he said.

1868
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:59,200
The Inspector stood with his mouth open.

1869
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:02,870
'Cars!' he said, amazed.

1870
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:04,710
'Yes,' said Fame, 'cars.'

1871
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:08,820
'But,' said the Inspector, 'you only had one
car.'

1872
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:12,530
'That's what you thought,' said Fame, smiling.

1873
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:18,220
'You mean that every time you crossed the
frontier you were driving a different car?'

1874
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:19,390
asked the Inspector.

1875
01:46:19,390 --> 01:46:21,040
'That's right,' said Fame.

1876
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:25,070
'The number plate was always the same and
the colour and type of car was always the

1877
01:46:25,070 --> 01:46:28,239
same, but it was a different car each time.'

1878
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:31,400
'But how...?' said the Inspector.

1879
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:32,530
'Why...?'

1880
01:46:32,530 --> 01:46:34,770
He was speechless.

1881
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:37,250
'Very simple,' said Fame.

1882
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:42,840
'On my side of the frontier, we made cars;
on your side of the frontier you needed cars.

1883
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:48,620
On my side of the frontier, cars were cheap;
on your side of the frontier, cars were expensive.

1884
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:52,700
So, I drove a new car from my country into
your country.

1885
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:56,040
I told the customs it was my car.

1886
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:59,920
When I got to Don's hideout, Don took the
new car.

1887
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:05,730
Then he gave me a secondhand car same color,
same type as a new car and I drove back to

1888
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:07,580
my country.

1889
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:12,660
Each time I came into your country, I was
in a new car but the car's number was the

1890
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:13,940
same.

1891
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:19,650
So we made a lot of money; we paid no tax
and we sold the new cars for a good price.

1892
01:47:19,650 --> 01:47:21,720
And nobody guessed.

1893
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:27,430
You all looked inside the car; you didn't
look at the car itself...'

1894
01:47:27,430 --> 01:47:29,260
There was a silence.

1895
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:35,420
'Well,' said the Inspector, 'I don't know
what to say.'

1896
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:37,420
'Say nothing,' said Fame.

1897
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:41,199
'It was all a long time ago.'

1898
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:56,460
And turning, Fame took Zara by the hand and
walked away.

1899
01:47:56,460 --> 01:48:10,429
- THE END -
