CHAPTER ONE
The Memento 

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,520
The window of Miss D'Armande's 
room looked out onto Broadway  

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:18,880
and its theatres. But Lynette D'Armande turned 
her chair round and sat with her back to Broadway.  

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:29,840
She was an actress, and needed the Broadway 
theatres, but Broadway did not need her.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,760
She was staying in the Hotel Thalia. 
Actors go there to rest for the summer  

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,160
and then try to get work for the autumn 
when the little theatres open again.  

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,160
Miss D'Armande's room in this hotel was a 
small one, but in it there were many mementoes  

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,560
of her days in the theatre, and there were 
also pictures of some of her best friends.  

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,240
She looked at one of these 
pictures now, and smiled at it.

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,160
'I'd like to know where Lee 
is now,' she said to herself.

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,800
She was looking at a picture of Miss 
Rosalie Ray, a very beautiful young woman.  

12
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:32,080
In the picture, Miss Ray was wearing a very short 
skirt and she was sitting on a swing. Every night  

13
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:39,840
in the theatre she went high in the air on 
her swing, over the heads of all the people.

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,080
When she did this, all the men in the 
theatre got very excited and stood up.  

15
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,040
This was because, when her long 
beautiful legs were high in the air,  

16
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,360
her yellow garter flew off and 
fell down to the men below.  

17
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,440
She did this every evening, and every evening 
a hundred hands went up to catch the garter.  

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:23,680
She did other things. She sang, she danced, but 
when she got onto her swing, all the men stood up.  

19
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,800
Miss Ray did not have to try very 
hard to find work in the theatre.

20
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,040
After two years of this, 
Miss D'Armande remembered,  

21
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,560
Miss Ray suddenly left the theatre 
and went to live in the country.

22
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:52,160
And seventeen minutes after Miss D'Armande 
said, 'I'd like to know where Lee is now',  

23
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,040
somebody knocked on the door.

24
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,320
It was, of course, Rosalie Ray.

25
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:12,640
'Come in,' Miss D'Armande called, and Miss 
Ray came in. Yes, it was Rosalie. She took  

26
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,680
off her hat, and Miss D'Armande could see 
that she looked very tired and unhappy.

27
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,280
'I've got the room above you,'  

28
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,680
Rosalie said. 'They told me at the 
desk downstairs that you were here.'

29
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:39,200
'I've been here since the end of April,' 
Lynnette replied. 'I begin work again next week,  

30
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:48,480
out in a small town. But you left the theatre 
three months ago, Lee. Why are you here?'

31
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:59,760
'I'll tell you, Lynn, but give me a drink first.' 
Miss D'Armande passed a bottle to her friend.

32
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,200
'Ah, that's good!' said Rosalie. 
'My first drink for three months.  

33
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,040
Yes, Lynn, I left the theatre 
because I was tired of the life,  

34
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,960
and because I was tired of men - 
well, the men who come to the theatre.  

35
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,320
You know we have to fight them off all the time.  

36
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:39,120
They're animals! They ask you to go out with them, 
they buy you a drink or two - and then they think  

37
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:49,200
that they can do what they want! It's terrible! 
And we work hard, we get very little money for it,  

38
00:04:50,320 --> 00:05:01,200
we wait to get to the top - and it never happens. 
But most of all, I left because of the men.

39
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,840
'Well, I saved two hundred dollars and 
when summer came, I left the theatre  

40
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:21,040
and went to a little village by the sea on Long 
Island. I planned to stay there for the summer,  

41
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,680
and then learn how to be a better actress.

42
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,920
'But there was another person who was staying in 
the same house - the Reverend Arthur Lyle. Yes,  

43
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,240
Lynn, a man of the church! When 
I saw him for the first time,  

44
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,040
I fell in love with him at once. He was 
a fine man and he had a wonderful voice!

45
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,480
'Well, it's only a short story, Lynn. 
A month later we decided to marry.  

46
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,840
We planned to live in a little house near 
the church, with lots of flowers and animals.

47
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,480
'No, I didn't tell him that I was an actress.  

48
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,840
I wanted to forget it and 
to put that life behind me.

49
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:32,320
'Oh, I was happy! I went to church, I helped the 
women in the village. Arthur and I went for long  

50
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:42,240
walks - and that little village was the best place 
in the world. I wanted to live there forever...

51
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,120
'But one morning, the old woman who worked 
in the house began to talk about Arthur.  

52
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,640
She thought that he was wonderful, too.  

53
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,600
But then she told me that Arthur was in love 
once before, and that it ended unhappily.  

54
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,840
She said that, in his desk, he kept a memento 
- something which belonged to the girl.  

55
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,480
Sometimes he took it out and looked at it. But she 
didn't know what it was - and his desk was locked.

56
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,320
'That afternoon I asked him about it.

57
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,960
"Ida," he said, (of course, 
I used my real name there)  

58
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,360
"it was before I knew you, and I never met 
her. It was different from my love for you."

59
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,320
"Was she beautiful?" I asked.

60
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,360
"She was very beautiful," replied Arthur.

61
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,320
"Did you see her often?"

62
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,240
"About ten times," he said.

63
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,520
"And this memento - did she send it to you?"

64
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,400
"It came to me from her," he said.

65
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,200
"Why did you never meet her?" I asked.

66
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:20,240
"She was far above me," he answered. "But, 
Ida, it's finished. You're not angry, are you?"

67
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:29,520
"Why, no. I love you ten times 
more than before." And I did, Lynn.  

68
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,920
Can you understand that? What 
a beautiful love that was!  

69
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:46,400
He never met her, never spoke to her, but 
he loved her, and wanted nothing from her.  

70
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,840
He was different from other men, 
I thought - a really good man!

71
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,240
'About four o'clock that afternoon, Arthur 
had to go out. The door of his room was open,  

72
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,280
his desk was unlocked, and I 
decided to look at this memento.  

73
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:20,000
I opened the desk and slowly I 
took out the box and opened it.

74
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:30,720
'I took one look at that memento, and then 
I went to my room and packed my suitcase.  

75
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:43,760
My wonderful Arthur, this really good man, 
was no different from all the other men!'

76
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,000
'But, Lee, what was in the 
box?' Miss D'Armande asked.

77
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,960
'It was one of my yellow 
garters!' cried Miss Ray.
 
 
 
 

78
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,568
- THE END -
