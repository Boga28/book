CHAPTER ONE
Salem

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,190
Salem is a beautiful American town in Massachusetts,
USA.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:16,059
Naumkeag, ''City of Peace", is its Indian
name.

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:23,279
But it is also called the "Witch City" because
of the witch hangings of 1692.

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,650
There are seven historical witch museums in
Salem.

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:35,340
They all have a lot of information on the
witches and hangings of 1692.

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,000
Kelly and Megan Connor are two sisters.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,180
They come from San Francisco, California.

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:49,330
The Connor family now lives in Salem because
Mr Connor teaches French at the University

10
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,420
of Boston.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,600
Kelly is fourteen and Megan is thirteen.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,030
They go to Salem Middle School and they like
it.

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,670
Kelly has red hair and blue eyes.

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,930
She's tall and plays basketball for the school
team.

15
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,140
Megan has fair hair and blue eyes.

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,579
She is a champion swimmer.

17
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:16,229
She is a member of the Salem Swimming Team.

18
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:23,240
It's Friday, October 28, and Halloween is
on Monday, October 31.

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,170
Kelly and Megan are very excited because they
love Halloween.

20
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,000
This is their first Halloween in Salem, the
"Witch City."

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,130
"I think about Halloween all the time," says
I Megan.

22
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,130
"Me too!"

23
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,409
says Kelly.

24
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:43,619
"We must buy a pumpkin and make a jack o'lantern,"
says their mother.

25
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:44,880
"Now finish your breakfast.

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,049
It's late!

27
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,770
School starts in twenty minutes."

28
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,560
The girls eat their eggs and drink their milk.

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,679
Then they go upstairs to brush their teeth.

30
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:00,179
They're ready at quarter past eight.

31
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:01,659
"Goodbye, mom!

32
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:06,340
Don't forget to buy the pumpkin!"

33
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,340
"OK!

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,980
Goodbye girls!"

35
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,050
Kelly and Megan always walk to school.

36
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,489
They meet their friends Susan Garcia, Nick
Lee and Bill Goldberg.

37
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:23,200
"I'm so excited about Halloween," says Susan.

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,590
Susan is Hispano-American.

39
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,000
She is 13 years old and has long black hair.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,659
"This is the first time we can have a party
without our parents!"

41
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:38,939
"We must find a place to have the party,"
says Nick.

42
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,299
He is 14 years old and he's a good cook.

43
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:45,310
His parents have a Chinese restaurant in Salem.

44
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,310
"Let's see!" says Bill.

45
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,040
"I can ask my grandmother."

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,019
Bill Goldberg is a handsome boy of 14.

47
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,599
His favorite school subject is science.

48
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,819
He lives with his grandmother.

49
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:03,269
"Susan, do you have a scary costume for Halloween?"
asks Kelly.

50
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:04,439
"It's a surprise!

51
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,640
I can't tell you," says Susan.

52
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,930
"Do you believe in ghosts?"

53
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,379
Bill asks.

54
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,300
"Yes!" they all say.

55
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,329
"Oh, I don't!" says Bill.

56
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,750
"Science can explain everything."

57
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,049
"Really?" says Nick.

58
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,790
"A lot of strange things happen on Halloween
night.

59
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,500
My grandparents come from China.

60
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,129
They believe in ghosts and evil spirits too."

61
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,579
Bill laughs.

62
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,480
"Do you remember the story of the old woman
in the cemetery..."

63
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,540
"Oh, Nick, please don't tell us again!"

64
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,299
says Bill.

65
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,750
Nick smiles mysteriously.

66
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:56,269
It's 8.30 a.m. and the school bell is ringing.

67
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:05,920
CHAPTER TWO
THE WITCH MUSEUM

68
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,730
School finishes at 3.30 p.m. Kelly and Megan
meet their friends outside.

69
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,560
"Do you have any ideas for our Halloween party?"

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Kelly asks.

71
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,680
"No, I don't," says Susan.

72
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,190
"I have an idea," says Megan.

73
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,389
"Let's visit one of the Salem Witch Museums!

74
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,500
We can get many ideas from there."

75
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,810
"That's a good idea!" says Susan.

76
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,970
"There are a lot of scary things there.

77
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,770
Remember, Salem is the 'Witch City'.

78
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,490
At the museum there are pictures of the witch
hangings.

79
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,150
There are also the names of the Salem witches
of 1692.

80
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,180
We can read about their terrible magic."

81
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,350
"Oh, how exciting!"

82
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,330
say Megan and Kelly.

83
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,270
"Let's go," says Susan.

84
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,160
The girls call Nick and Bill.

85
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,220
Together the five friends go to the museum.

86
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,000
When they arrive it's late.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,860
"How many tickets do you want?" asks the attendant.

88
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,700
"Five tickets, please," says Bill.

89
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,240
"That's $10.

90
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,710
Remember, the museum closes at 5 p.m.

91
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,330
You only have half an hour."

92
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,360
The five friends walk around the museum.

93
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,800
They look at the interesting exhibits.

94
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,410
"Look, here are the names of the witches of
1692... and here are the pictures of the hangings,"

95
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,410
says Nick.

96
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,889
"Look at this rope!" says Bill.

97
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:35,319
"How scary!"

98
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,800
say the girls.

99
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,320
"I'm going upstairs," says Megan.

100
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,330
"Be careful," says Kelly.

101
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:52,060
Megan laughs, "I'm not afraid of witches or
ghosts."

102
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,620
There are no visitors upstairs.

103
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,789
There is a sweet smell of roses in the air.

104
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:02,260
Megan walks around and looks at everything.

105
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,460
Then she sees an old lady.

106
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,319
She has a long black dress with small black
buttons.

107
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,240
Her skin is very white and her lips are very
red.

108
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,129
There is a strange red mark around her neck.

109
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,479
She smiles at Megan.

110
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,860
Megan smiles too, but she is nervous.

111
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,870
Suddenly the air is very cold.

112
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,530
"How strange," she thinks.

113
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:43,160
"I want to go downstairs."

114
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,620
When Kelly sees her, she asks, "What's upstairs?"

115
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,740
"Oh, some interesting exhibits," answers Megan.

116
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,490
"The museum closes in five minutes," says
the attendant.

117
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:02,949
Susan buys a book called Salem and the Witches
of 1692.

118
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:05,650
The three girls walk to the front door.

119
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,500
"Is there anyone still upstairs?" asks the
attendant.

120
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,300
"Yes," says Megan.

121
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,229
"There's an old lady."

122
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:16,410
"Really!" says the attendant.

123
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,069
"That's strange.

124
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:21,800
You are the only visitors in the museum this
afternoon.

125
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,250
There aren't many visitors here on Fridays."

126
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,990
"There is an old lady upstairs," says Megan.

127
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,199
"I'm going upstairs to see," says the attendant.

128
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,159
After a few minutes he returns.

129
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:40,190
His face is red and he says, "Is this a joke?

130
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:46,830
There's no one upstairs... and the only door
of the museum is this front door."

131
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,189
Megan's friends look at her.

132
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:50,909
She is silent.

133
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:54,340
Then she says, "Let's look outside."

134
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,319
They run out of the museum and look outside.

135
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,009
There's no one in the street, only a black
cat.

136
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:08,050
After this strange experience they walk home.

137
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:15,080
"Now I have a lot of ideas for our Halloween
party," says Kelly.

138
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,440
"Yes, I do too," says Susan.

139
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,599
"You're very quiet, Megan," says Bill.

140
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:34,190
"I'm thinking about the old lady at the museum."

141
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:42,310
CHAPTER THREE
September 22, 1692

142
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,600
There is no school on Saturday.

143
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,920
It is a cloudy autumn day.

144
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,779
Autumn is usually a beautiful season in Salem.

145
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:58,050
The leaves on the trees are yellow, red and
orange.

146
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,110
Mr and Mrs Connor have a big orange pumpkin.

147
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,110
They are making a jack o'lantern.

148
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:10,670
"When it's finished we can put it in front
of the window," says Mr Connor.

149
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,250
"Are you girls ready for Halloween?"

150
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,870
"No, Dad.

151
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,890
We must find a place for the party," says
Kelly.

152
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,149
"We must make our costumes too," says Megan.

153
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:25,800
"Today is a perfect day to do many things,"
says Mrs Connor.

154
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,070
"Finish your homework this morning.

155
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,390
Then you can look for a place for the party
this afternoon."

156
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,910
"I can start my science homework," says Megan.

157
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,110
"I must study English," says Kelly.

158
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,089
"I have a test on Wednesday."

159
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:44,820
They go to their room and study until noon.

160
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,640
Then the phone rings.

161
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,560
"Hello!

162
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
This is Bill.

163
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,720
I have a place for our party."

164
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
"Really!

165
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
That's great!

166
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Where is it?"

167
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
says Kelly.

168
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,380
"It's a surprise.

169
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,769
Meet me and Nick in front of the school at
1.30 p.m.

170
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:07,430
We can go together."

171
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,430
"OK.

172
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,649
At half past one then," says Kelly.

173
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:16,170
The five friends meet in front of their school.

174
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,070
They are very excited.

175
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,990
"Where is the place?" asks Susan.

176
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,910
"Follow me," says Bill.

177
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,839
"My grandmother knows this place.

178
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,149
It is the best place for a spooky Halloween
party."

179
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:33,899
They walk past the park, past the tennis courts
and past the church.

180
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,000
Then they walk down a country road.

181
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,399
At the end of the road they see an old cemetery.

182
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,440
"This is the oldest cemetery in Salem," says
Bill.

183
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,500
They enter the old cemetery.

184
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,700
"Look at the dates on the tombstones.

185
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,950
This one says September 22, 1692," says Megan.

186
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:02,160
"This one says September 22, 1692, too," says
Kelly.

187
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,600
"Here's another tombstone with the same date,
September 22, 1692," says Nick.

188
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,610
They look at a lot of tombstones.

189
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,640
"These are probably the tombstones of the
Salem witches," says Bill.

190
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,800
"How spooky!

191
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,540
Let's go now!"

192
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,620
says Susan.

193
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,160
The five friends run to the country road.

194
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,690
Then they walk for a few minutes.

195
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:32,269
At the end of the road they see an old, abandoned
house.

196
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:34,700
It is near a forest.

197
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,240
There is a rose bush near the door.

198
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,220
"This is the house for our party," says Bill.

199
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,329
His friends are very surprised.

200
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,779
They look at the house.

201
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:46,779
"Wow!

202
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,920
Is this a haunted house?"

203
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,570
Nick asks.

204
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,160
Bill laughs.

205
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,220
"This is a very old house from the 1650s.

206
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,240
Poor people sometimes live in it but then
they go away.

207
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,780
It's abandoned.

208
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,040
There is no electricity."

209
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,550
"Why is it abandoned?" asks Nick.

210
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,610
"They say strange things happen here.

211
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,370
It's the perfect place for a spooky party.

212
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,100
Remember, ghosts don't exist," Bill says.

213
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,670
"Are you sure?" asks Kelly.

214
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,010
The five friends look at each other.

215
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:35,430
"There is something strange about this place,"
says Nick.

216
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:46,199
CHAPTER FOUR
The Abandoned House

217
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:54,100
Megan looks at the old house and says, "Look
at the writing above the door:

218
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:03,630
HOME OF ABIGAIL CROSS OCTOBER 31, 1627 - SEPTEMBER
22, 1692

219
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,950
Who is Abigail Cross?

220
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:13,320
Look at the date: September 22, 1692.

221
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,230
Do you remember the tombstones?

222
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,380
Many of them have the same date."

223
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,060
"You're right," says Susan.

224
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:28,460
"Let me look in my new book, Salem and the
Witches of 1692."

225
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,410
After a few minutes Susan says, "Oh, no!

226
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,910
Abigail Cross is a witch.

227
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,260
Her name is in this book.

228
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,850
I don't like this old house."

229
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,579
"Let's find another place for the party,"
says Kelly.

230
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,149
"You girls are silly!

231
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:49,070
This is perfect!" says Bill.

232
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,449
"Come on!

233
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:53,829
Follow me!"

234
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:56,940
Bill is the first to enter the house.

235
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,560
Nick and the girls follow.

236
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,639
It is very cold inside.

237
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,390
There is a big room with an old table, chairs
and a cupboard.

238
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,089
On the wall there is an old portrait of a
woman.

239
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:15,030
She is wearing a long black dress.

240
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,160
She has a red rose in her hand.

241
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,430
Her eyes are dark and evil.

242
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,170
"This portrait is very old.

243
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,980
There's a date at the bottom.

244
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:34,340
It says June 1659," says Megan.

245
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,970
"It's probably a portrait of Abigail Cross,"
says Nick.

246
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,740
"She's looking at us and she's... smiling!"
says Megan.

247
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,190
"What an evil smile!" says Susan.

248
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,440
"Everything here is so old and scary," says
Kelly.

249
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,279
"I like it," says Nick.

250
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,200
"We can make spooky decorations and light
candles.

251
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,709
I can bring my portable radio for music."

252
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:03,529
"First we must clean this house.

253
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:07,410
Then we can make the decorations," says Susan.

254
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,560
Nick and Bill go to buy some cleaning products.

255
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,360
The girls talk about the party.

256
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,910
"How many chairs are there?" asks Kelly.

257
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,600
"There are eight chairs," answers Megan.

258
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,560
"We must bring chairs from home.

259
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,110
Fifteen of our friends are coming to the party,"
says Susan.

260
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,240
"I want to look at the old kitchen."

261
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,279
"I want to look at the other rooms," says
Megan.

262
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,900
She walks down a long corridor.

263
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,459
She finds three rooms with some old furniture.

264
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:48,970
Then she opens a small door and enters a dark
bedroom.

265
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:54,839
There is a sweet smell of roses.

266
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,910
She sees a long black dress with small black
buttons on a big bed.

267
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:06,190
On the floor she sees a pair of old black
boots.

268
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,410
They are wet!

269
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,120
She looks outside the window.

270
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,589
It is raining.

271
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,589
She looks in an old mirror.

272
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:19,660
Someone in the mirror is looking at her!

273
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,170
Megan is afraid.

274
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,420
She wants to leave the room but her legs can't
move.

275
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,540
She wants to call Kelly and Susan.

276
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,360
But she has no voice.

277
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,750
Suddenly Kelly calls her.

278
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,110
"Megan, what are you doing?"

279
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,580
Megan can't answer.

280
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,290
Kelly and Susan run to the bedroom.

281
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,269
"Megan, what's happening?"

282
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,810
Megan's face is white.

283
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,860
She points to the black dress and the wet
boots.

284
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,089
The girls are very surprised.

285
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:56,910
"Do you remember the old lady at the museum?"

286
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,910
Megan whispers.

287
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,769
"This is her dress and those are her boots.

288
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:03,870
Look, they're wet!"

289
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,520
"Are you sure that old lady exists?

290
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,730
Maybe it's your imagination," says Kelly.

291
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,950
Megan is angry.

292
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,000
"It's not my imagination.

293
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,040
This is Abigail Cross' house and these are
her clothes.

294
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,590
Abigail Cross is here!"

295
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,600
"Abigail Cross is dead!"

296
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,840
"But her ghost isn't!"

297
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,130
CHAPTER FIVE
Halloween Costumes

298
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:45,360
Megan, Kelly and Susan go back to the big
room.

299
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,730
They look at the old portrait.

300
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,330
They don't like it.

301
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,900
Soon the boys arrive with some cleaning products
and a broom.

302
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,320
The girls say, "Abigail Cross' dress and boots
are in the bedroom!"

303
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,600
"Someone wants to scare us," says Bill.

304
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,840
"The door of the house is always open.

305
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,440
Anyone can enter.

306
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,080
This is a very old house.

307
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,440
Old houses have old clothes!"

308
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,760
Nick is very quiet.

309
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,030
Then he says, "This is exciting.

310
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,800
On Monday we can tell our friends about this
place!

311
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,640
Maybe we can see a ghost!"

312
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
"Ghosts!

313
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,950
How silly!

314
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,210
Come on, let's start cleaning," says Bill.

315
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,990
They clean the windows, the table and the
chairs.

316
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,400
"It's 5 p.m.

317
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,920
It's time to go home," says Nick.

318
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,380
"I help my parents at the restaurant.

319
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,120
The restaurant is always full on Saturdays.

320
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,870
We can return tomorrow for the decorations."

321
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,510
"We must also talk about the games for the
party," says Susan.

322
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:55,150
"OK, let's meet here tomorrow at 1 p.m." says
Bill.

323
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,530
Everyone goes home.

324
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:03,050
After dinner Mrs Connor makes Halloween cookies
and pumpkin pies.

325
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:07,390
Mr Connor puts the jack o'lantern in front
of the window.

326
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,900
Kelly and Megan go to their room.

327
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,320
They want to make their Halloween costumes.

328
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,540
"Do you think Abigail Cross is a ghost?" asks
Kelly.

329
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,970
"I'm very confused.

330
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,130
I don't know, but that house is... evil."

331
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,560
"I don't want to be afraid," says Kelly.

332
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,980
"I want to have fun at the Halloween party."

333
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,200
"You're right.

334
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,110
Let's not talk about ghosts," says Megan.

335
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,240
The girls start making their Halloween costumes.

336
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,090
"I want to be an alien," says Megan.

337
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,780
"Look at my green mask!"

338
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,170
"It's nice.

339
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,170
I like it.

340
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,600
But what can I be?"

341
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,100
Kelly thinks for a long time.

342
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,560
Then she says, "I want to be Abigail Cross,
the witch."

343
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
"No, Kelly, don't do it!"

344
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
says Megan.

345
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
"Why not?

346
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,860
It's an easy costume.

347
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,240
I can wear mom's long black dress.

348
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,911
Then I can buy a mask and a wig.

349
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,040
I have a pair of old black boots.

350
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,230
I want to scare everyone," Kelly laughs.

351
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,110
"Aren't you afraid?" asks Megan.

352
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,970
"No, it's just a Halloween costume," says
Kelly.

353
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,650
"Remember, our costumes are a secret.

354
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,850
Don't tell anyone!"

355
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:25,290
On Sunday afternoon the five friends meet
at the abandoned house.

356
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,090
When they enter they look at the portrait.

357
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,850
The woman has the same evil smile.

358
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,220
But there is something different in the portrait.

359
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,100
Megan sees it.

360
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,910
She turns on her torch and says, "Look at
the woman in the portrait.

361
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,410
She has a red mark around her neck."

362
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,280
"You're right," says Nick.

363
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,740
They all look at the portrait.

364
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,460
"What does it mean?"

365
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,160
"It's your imagination," says Bill.

366
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,410
"You can see the red mark because you have
a torch.

367
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:00,560
Who wants to go downstairs and see the basement?"
asks Bill.

368
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,090
"We can use the basement for scary games."

369
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,090
"You boys can go to the basement," says Susan.

370
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:12,420
"We want to move the old table to the center
of the room."

371
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,940
Megan goes to the dark bedroom.

372
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,840
She opens the door and looks inside.

373
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,780
The black dress and the black boots are still
there.

374
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,290
She shuts the door quickly.

375
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,810
Her heart is beating fast.

376
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:42,280
When the boys return they say, "There is nothing
in the basement, only some old barrels."

377
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,710
CHAPTER SIX
Mysterious Names

378
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,620
The girls look at the floor.

379
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,660
"This floor is very dirty.

380
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,160
It is made of stone and it's difficult to
clean.

381
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,320
Let's wash it with hot water and detergent,"
says Susan.

382
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:08,650
So, Susan and Kelly wash the stone floor.

383
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,890
Suddenly Susan stops washing.

384
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,350
She looks at the stones and says, "I can't
believe this.

385
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,850
There are names on these stones!"

386
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,660
Her friends come and look.

387
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,360
"One name is George Johnson.

388
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,680
Then there's Rebecca Putnam and Sarah Morely."

389
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,830
"This is very strange," says Bill.

390
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,540
"Look at the other names."

391
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,290
He reads them and then he counts them.

392
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,850
"There are 20.

393
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,620
This is a mystery.

394
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,760
Who wrote them?

395
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,970
What do they mean?"

396
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,790
"Can you repeat the names?

397
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:52,290
Perhaps I can find them in my book," says
Susan.

398
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,660
Bill tells her the names.

399
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,220
She finds all of them in her book.

400
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,380
"How spooky!

401
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,460
These are the names of the twenty witches
of the hangings of 1692.

402
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,500
There are seven men and thirteen women.

403
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,950
Look at this page:

404
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,240
THE SALEM WITCH HANGINGS OF 1692

405
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,920
June 10 - one hanging

406
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,730
July 19 - five hangings

407
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,470
August 19 - five hangings

408
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,110
September 19 - one hanging

409
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,840
September 22 - eight hangings."

410
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,130
"What can we do?" asks Kelly.

411
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,530
"Nothing," says Bill.

412
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,340
"Are you afraid of names on stones?"

413
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,510
"But these are not the names of ordinary people.

414
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:48,810
These are the names of twenty witches," says
Megan.

415
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,930
"Witches have magic powers."

416
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,280
"We can show our friends at the party.

417
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,410
We can scare them," says Nick laughing.

418
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,900
"That's a great idea.

419
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,960
This Halloween party is exciting!" says Bill.

420
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,730
"Let's put the decorations on the walls.

421
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,540
There are bats, spiders and pumpkins!"

422
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,880
"Who wants to bring the food and drinks?"
asks Nick.

423
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,870
"Megan and I can bring pumpkin pies and Halloween
cookies," says Kelly.

424
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,840
"I can bring apple pies, popcorn and sweets,"
says Susan.

425
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,500
"Let me bring drinks and candles," says Bill.

426
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,340
"Then I can bring paper plates, paper cups
and a paper tablecloth.

427
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,820
I can also bring some chairs," says Nick.

428
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,790
"Don't forget your portable radio, Nick,"
says Kelly.

429
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,790
"OK.

430
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,640
So, everything is ready for the party," says
Bill.

431
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,380
"We must be here at 8 o'clock to prepare things.

432
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,560
The party starts at 9 p.m."

433
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:55,010
It's Monday, 31 October - Halloween!

434
00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:00,980
There are Halloween decorations in the homes,
in the shops and in the classrooms.

435
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:07,160
When school finishes, Kelly buys a wig and
a mask of an old lady.

436
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,030
That evening Kelly and Megan put on their
costumes.

437
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:18,950
When Mrs Connor sees them she says, "What
wonderful costumes - a green alien and an

438
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,250
old lady!"

439
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,340
"I'm not an ordinary old lady.

440
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,720
I'm a Salem witch and the year is 1692!" says
Kelly.

441
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,530
"Wow!" says Mr Connor.

442
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,170
"Where is the party?"

443
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,770
"It's at the abandoned house near the old
cemetery."

444
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,110
"That's exciting!

445
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,220
Have fun!" says Mr Connor.

446
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,670
"Goodbye girls!

447
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:50,010
Have fun!" says Mrs Connor.

448
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:59,120
CHAPTER SEVEN
The House of Horrors

449
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,250
The five friends meet at eight that evening.

450
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,920
Everyone has a scary costume.

451
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,100
Bill is a vampire.

452
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,690
Nick is a skeleton.

453
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,360
Susan is a ghost.

454
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:22,130
When they see Kelly's costume they laugh and
say, "Good evening, Mrs Abigail Cross!"

455
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,390
They cover the old table with a paper tablecloth.

456
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,450
Then they put the food and drinks on the table.

457
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:39,610
They light the candles because there is no
electricity.

458
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,730
Nick turns on his portable radio.

459
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,100
Megan goes to the dark bedroom.

460
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,240
She opens the door and looks inside.

461
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,380
The black dress and black boots are not there.

462
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,850
She is afraid, but she says nothing to her
friends.

463
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,830
Soon their friends arrive.

464
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,030
They all have scary costumes and masks.

465
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,980
"Is this a haunted house?

466
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,790
It's very spooky," they say.

467
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,170
No one answers.

468
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,920
Some boys and girls dance.

469
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,450
Others eat, talk and laugh.

470
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,040
Several hours pass.

471
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Everyone is happy.

472
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,910
"It's a great party," they say.

473
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:34,520
"It's time for the treasure hunt," says Bill.

474
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,020
"You all have different maps.

475
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,930
Let's start."

476
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,610
Everyone starts in a different room.

477
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:48,070
Some start in the kitchen, others start in
the bedrooms.

478
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,910
Kelly takes her torch and goes downstairs
to the basement.

479
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,790
She looks inside a big barrel.

480
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:00,580
It is very dark and Kelly is in the basement
alone.

481
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:08,180
Suddenly there is a sweet smell of roses.

482
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,760
She turns on her torch and she is terrified.

483
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,230
The old lady from the museum is standing by
the barrel!

484
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,460
"You are not Abigail Cross.

485
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,490
I am Abigail Cross.

486
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,750
Tonight is Halloween and you are in my house.

487
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:29,380
On this night we spirits look for young bodies.

488
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,480
When we find a young body we can live again.

489
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,650
At midnight my spirit enters your body.

490
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:41,960
You must die so that I can live!"

491
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,250
Kelly's heart is beating fast.

492
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,380
Her legs can't move.

493
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,030
She has no voice.

494
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:55,210
Abigail Cross touches Kelly with her cold
hand.

495
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,980
She takes off Kelly's mask and wig.

496
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,970
"Your bed is in the barrel.

497
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,970
You are tired.

498
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,630
You must sleep... forever."

499
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,360
Kelly obeys.

500
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,370
She goes to sleep inside the barrel.

501
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,470
Abigail puts on Kelly's mask and wig.

502
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:25,450
She goes upstairs to the party.

503
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:30,720
At half past eleven Nick says, "It's almost
midnight.

504
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,570
Let's sit down and take off our masks.

505
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,950
We want to see the person behind the mask!"

506
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,380
Nick asks, "Who is the alien?"

507
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,920
The alien takes off her mask.

508
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,789
"It's Megan!"

509
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:45,840
Everyone laughs.

510
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,590
"And who is the ghost?

511
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,090
It's Susan!"

512
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:55,280
"Who is the old lady?" asks Bill.

513
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,490
The old lady takes off her mask.

514
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,160
Everyone screams.

515
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,690
It's Abigail Cross' ghost!

516
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,920
Her face is white and her eyes are red.

517
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,690
She has a red mark around her neck.

518
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,260
She laughs and her teeth are black.

519
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,760
Everyone is terrified.

520
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,530
Bill looks at her and says, "That's Kelly's
costume.

521
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,530
Where is Kelly?"

522
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,810
"I am Kelly.

523
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,950
At midnight my spirit enters her body.

524
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,400
Remember, I am a witch."

525
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,640
Everyone wants to run away.

526
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,790
They go to the door but they cannot open it.

527
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:40,800
There are the horrible faces of the other
ghosts outside the windows.

528
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,190
The ghosts are looking inside.

529
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,350
"Who are these people?" asks Bill.

530
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,510
"Ha, ha!

531
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:52,730
They are the witches of the hangings of 1692.

532
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,430
Look at the red mark on my neck.

533
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,230
This is the mark of the rope.

534
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:03,130
Twenty witches for twenty young bodies.

535
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,960
Now you are in my house.

536
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,080
This is the house of horrors.

537
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,600
No one leaves this house alive.

538
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,420
At midnight our spirits enter your bodies.

539
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,110
We want to live again.

540
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:25,130
We want to bring evil to Salem," says Abigail
Cross.

541
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,760
"Where is Kelly?" asks Bill.

542
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,700
"Look at the portrait on the wall," laughs
the witch.

543
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,220
Everyone looks at the portrait.

544
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,570
They see Kelly's face!

545
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:43,360
Her lips are red and there is a red mark around
her neck.

546
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,210
"This is our party, not yours!"

547
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,210
screams the witch.

548
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,210
CHAPTER EIGHT
Fire!

549
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,210
Suddenly the decorations on the wall start
moving.

550
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,210
The bats are flying around the room.

551
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,210
They are making strange noises.

552
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,210
"No!"

553
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,210
screams a girl.

554
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,210
"There's a bat in my hair."

555
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,210
"Help!"

556
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,210
screams a boy.

557
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,210
"This bat is a vampire!"

558
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,210
Slowly the ghosts enter the house.

559
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,210
They penetrate the walls.

560
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,210
They are really spooky.

561
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,210
They move around their victims.

562
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,210
Megan and Susan are terrified and say, "They're
waiting for midnight!

563
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,210
Do you remember the twenty names on the floor?

564
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,210
These are their ghosts!"

565
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,210
"We must find Kelly," says Megan.

566
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,210
A candle on the table falls.

567
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,210
The paper tablecloth is burning.

568
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,210
"Fire!

569
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,210
We must get out of here!" says Bill.

570
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,210
''Oh, no!

571
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,210
It's a big fire!" says Susan.

572
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,210
"We can't open the door," says Nick.

573
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,210
"It's five to midnight.

574
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,210
At midnight the ghosts take our bodies.

575
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,210
What can we do?"

576
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,210
"I must find Kelly," says Bill.

577
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,210
He takes his torch and runs to the basement.

578
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,210
He looks in all the barrels.

579
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,210
Finally he sees Kelly.

580
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,210
She is sleeping.

581
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,210
"Kelly, Kelly!" says Bill.

582
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,210
"Wake up!

583
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,210
Wake up!"

584
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,210
Kelly does not wake up.

585
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,210
"Kelly!" says Bill.

586
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,210
"Kelly!"

587
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,210
Bill takes Kelly in his arms and carries her
upstairs.

588
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,210
It's two minutes to midnight.

589
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,210
There is fire everywhere.

590
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,210
The room is full of black smoke.

591
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,210
Everyone is terrified.

592
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,210
Bats and spiders are flying in the air.

593
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,210
The ghosts are waiting for midnight.

594
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,210
No one can open the door or the windows.

595
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,210
Suddenly the portrait is burning.

596
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,210
The fire is destroying the evil spirit.

597
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,210
"Look!"

598
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,210
exclaims Megan.

599
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,210
"Abigail Cross is burning!"

600
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,210
"Yes," says Nick, "and the other ghosts are
burning too!"

601
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,210
"Look, the door is opening," says Bill.

602
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,210
"Quick, let's go!"

603
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,210
Everyone runs outside.

604
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,210
Bill carries Kelly outside.

605
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,210
"Is everyone here?"

606
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,210
asks Nick.

607
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,210
He counts.

608
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,210
There are twenty people.

609
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,210
The fire destroys the house and the evil ghosts
inside.

610
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,210
Terrible noises come from the house.

611
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,210
"This is the scariest Halloween party of my
life," says one of the boys.

612
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,210
Megan and Bill are waking up Kelly.

613
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,210
She is still sleeping.

614
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,210
But no one can wake her up.

615
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,210
"Is she in a coma?" asks Megan.

616
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,210
"I don't know," answers Bill.

617
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,210
Everyone is standing near Kelly.

618
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,210
"Oh, Kelly, please wake up," says Megan.

619
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,210
Suddenly it starts raining.

620
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,210
There is thunder and lightning.

621
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,210
Kelly moves her head.

622
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,210
"Where am I?" she asks.

623
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,210
“Oh, Kelly!

624
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,210
You're OK!

625
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,210
I'm so happy," says Megan.

626
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,210
"What's happening?" asks Kelly.

627
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,210
Bill smiles and explains everything to her.

628
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,210
"Do you believe in ghosts now?" asks Nick.

629
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,210
Bill looks at him and slowly says, "Well...
yes."

630
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,210
Then they all go home.

631
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,210
Kelly has some strange dreams that night.

632
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,210
The next morning she wakes up early.

633
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,210
Megan is still sleeping.

634
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,210
She is happy to be home.

635
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,210
She gets up and goes to the bathroom.

636
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,210
She looks in the mirror and cannot believe
her eyes.

637
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,210
What can she see?

638
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,210
A red mark around her neck.

639
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,210
A mysterious voice in the mirror says, "When
you play with fire, Kelly, you burn your fingers!"

640
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:21,212
- THE END -
