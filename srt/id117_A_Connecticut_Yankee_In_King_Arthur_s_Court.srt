00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,130
CHAPTER ONE
King Arthur's Court

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,900
I was at Warwick Castle in England when I
met a stranger.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,570
He told me many stories about the past.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,440
I liked them very much.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,209
Then we saw some very old armour.

6
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:19,699
There was a bullet hole in the armour.

7
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,589
"This hole is later.

8
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:29,099
It comes after the invention of firearms,"
said the guide.

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:36,020
"I did it," said the stranger, and smiled.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,760
I was very surprised.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,580
The stranger was staying at my hotel.

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,280
He came to my room and gave me a manuscript.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,810
His name was Hank Morgan.

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:57,150
This is his story.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,110
I was in my factory in Connecticut.

16
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:06,150
A worker hit me on the head and I fell down.

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:13,470
I woke up under a tree and saw a strange man
in armour on a horse.

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,890
He said I was his prisoner.

19
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,819
His name was Sir Kay.

20
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,929
I went with him to a village.

21
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:26,689
He said it was Camelot.

22
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,509
I was sure it was a lunatic asylum.

23
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:34,100
I thought all the people were mad.

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,280
They all looked at my clothes.

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,390
They thought I was strange.

26
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,990
I started to talk to a page.

27
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,959
His name was Clarence.

28
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,369
"Where am I?"

29
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:51,810
I asked.

30
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,700
"King Arthur's Court, in the year 513," he
answered.

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,810
"You are a prisoner.

32
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,060
They are going to kill you.

33
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,359
But I will come and visit you in prison."

34
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:12,510
Then some people took me to the King at his
round table.

35
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:19,170
There were lots of knights sitting round the
table eating.

36
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,750
Lots of people served them food.

37
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,780
Beautiful ladies watched from a balcony.

38
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,780
Musicians played on another balcony.

39
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,330
The room was very big and made of stone.

40
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,880
The knights' and ladies' clothes were beautiful.

41
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,200
An old man stood up and told a story.

42
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Everyone was bored and fell asleep.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,880
The old man was Merlin.

44
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,620
Then Sir Kay told the story of my capture.

45
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,470
He told a lot of lies and said I was very
dangerous.

46
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,820
He presented me to Queen Guenever.

47
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,340
He said my clothes were magic.

48
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,130
They took away my clothes and then put me
in prison.

49
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:20,460
I fell asleep.

50
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,820
When I woke up, I thought it was all a dream.

51
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:32,090
Then I realized it was true: I was a prisoner
at King Arthur's court.

52
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,130
Clarence came to visit me.

53
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,750
"Help me to escape," I said to him.

54
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,880
"I can't," he answered.

55
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,970
"There are lots of guards.

56
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,410
And Merlin has put a spell on this prison.

57
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,920
No one can escape.

58
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,740
Tomorrow at noon they are going to burn you."

59
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:02,260
I was very miserable but I had an idea.

60
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,350
"I am not afraid," I said.

61
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,010
"I am a very powerful magician.

62
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,780
Is today the 20th of June?"

63
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,900
"Yes, it is," said Clarence.

64
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:27,440
"Then go and tell the king that if he burns
me, tomorrow the world will end in darkness.

65
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,480
I'll end light and warmth.

66
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,220
Everyone will die."

67
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:44,620
I knew from my studies that on 21st June 513
there was a total solar eclipse.

68
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:52,660
That was my magic: to make the sun disappear!

69
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:58,389
The next day they came to get me and tied
me to a big tree.

70
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,180
People sat to watch all around.

71
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,570
Everyone wanted to see.

72
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,120
I was afraid.

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,440
And if my calculations were wrong?

74
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,840
Then everyone looked up.

75
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,370
The eclipse was beginning!

76
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,520
"Burn him," shouted Merlin.

77
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,060
"Stop!"

78
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,240
shouted King Arthur.

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,730
"Have mercy!

80
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,740
Do not destroy the sun.

81
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,400
What do you want?

82
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,230
I can give you anything!"

83
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:45,790
I said I wanted to be his minister and help
him, and he agreed.

84
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:52,230
The solar eclipse was now total, everything
was dark.

85
00:05:52,230 --> 00:06:00,550
So I pointed to the sun and shouted, "Pass
away and do not harm us!"

86
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:08,060
The sun started to come out again and everyone
was happy.

87
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,470
I became the first minister and the most powerful
man in Camelot.

88
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,090
Clarence was my assistant.

89
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:26,700
I had beautiful but very uncomfortable clothes
and the best rooms after the king.

90
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,780
People came from all over the country to see
me.

91
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:41,430
I was famous, but they wanted another piece
of powerful magic from me.

92
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,000
Merlin was in prison.

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,860
He was my enemy, so I said I wanted to explode
his tower with fire from the sky.

94
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:59,820
His tower was an old Roman one and very solid.

95
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:07,690
One stormy night I filled it with gunpowder
and attached a metal stick to it.

96
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:16,010
Then I told everyone to gather, and we watched
as the lightning hit the tower and it exploded.

97
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,290
Everyone was afraid.

98
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,200
They thought I was a very powerful magician.

99
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:30,620
As time passed, I realized that the people
in Camelot were like children.

100
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,110
They were very simple.

101
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,320
They couldn't read or write and they were
not logical.

102
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,150
They believed everything they heard.

103
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,551
I started to open secret schools and a secret
military academy.

104
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:52,639
I put down telephone wires to have telephones.

105
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,730
I wanted to create newspapers.

106
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,699
I taught Clarence to be a journalist.

107
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:05,250
The king and the nobles believed they were
better than me because I was not noble, but

108
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,979
they respected my intelligence.

109
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:15,139
I thought I was better than them because I
was intelligent, but I liked them.

110
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:22,979
No one admitted all this and we got on very
well.

111
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:28,639
After four years, King Arthur was very happy
with my work.

112
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,399
He was richer because I managed his money
well.

113
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,760
I also distributed it better, and the people
of Camelot were happier.

114
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,490
They started to call me 'The Boss'.

115
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,810
I liked it.

116
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,710
The main entertainment at Camelot was jousting.

117
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,200
Hundreds of knights took part and many were
injured.

118
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,070
Sometimes the knights went to save princesses
from dragons.

119
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:05,360
They believed in dragons and giants.

120
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,350
One day a girl came to Camelot.

121
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:13,350
Her name was Alisande la Carteloise.

122
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:19,610
She said her mistress and forty-four girls,
many of whom were princesses, were captive

123
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,060
in a castle.

124
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,940
The guards were three huge men with four arms
and one eye.

125
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,990
At Camelot, they decided I had to rescue them.

126
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:40,350
I decided it was time for a holiday so I agreed.

127
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,990
I asked Alisande questions.

128
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,600
She couldn't tell me anything.

129
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,779
"Where is the castle?"

130
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:53,420
"Many miles away," she answered.

131
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,120
"How many," I asked.

132
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,180
"I don't know," she said.

133
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,440
"They all look the same."

134
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,380
I got up early and had breakfast.

135
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,540
Then I put on my armour.

136
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,250
It took a very long time.

137
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,530
There were many pieces and I couldn't move
or do anything.

138
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:23,370
They had to carry me out and lift me onto
the horse.

139
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,100
I felt like a ship going to sea.

140
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,440
Then Alisande climbed onto the horse behind
me.

141
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,120
She had to show me the way to the castle.

142
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,540
We started out and everyone waved good bye
to us.

143
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:50,420
CHAPTER TWO
Freemen!

144
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,170
We were immediately in the countryside.

145
00:10:53,170 --> 00:11:01,850
It was lovely and pleasant, very green, there
were a lot of trees, fields and rivers.

146
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,870
Then it started to get hot.

147
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,680
Sweat ran into my eyes.

148
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,440
My armour got heavier and heavier.

149
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:18,460
Finally, Alisande took off my helmet, filled
it with water and poured it into my armour.

150
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,340
I felt better.

151
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,910
Alisande never stopped talking.

152
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:30,370
I told her to take a rest and not use up all
the air.

153
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,800
Night approached.

154
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,860
It got dark fast.

155
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,930
I found a place for Alisande to sleep and
then one for me.

156
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:47,320
It got very cold, and lots of insects climbed
inside my armour.

157
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,420
I couldn't sleep.

158
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:56,200
In the morning, I was cold, tired and hungry.

159
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,080
Sandy was bright and fresh.

160
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,430
We set off.

161
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:08,470
Suddenly we met a group of poor, ragged people.

162
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:14,269
I had breakfast with them and saw they were
very happy.

163
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:17,230
They were Freemen.

164
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,710
They were farmers and artisans, about seven
tenths of the population.

165
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:29,710
They were the only useful part of the population
but they could do nothing without the permission

166
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,320
of their lords or the church.

167
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,130
They couldn't sell anything without paying
tax.

168
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:43,589
They had to give part of their produce to
the lords and bishops and work for them.

169
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:51,950
These men were free, but they were repairing
the bishop's roads as part of their duty.

170
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:59,350
I asked them: 'If you had a vote tomorrow,
would you vote for a king?'

171
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,140
They didn't understand, except for one man.

172
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:11,900
He said, in a nation with a vote there are
no kings or bishops.

173
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:18,430
I decided to send him to my Man Factory, a
school where Clarence was teaching people

174
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,010
to read and write.

175
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,610
I gave the men three pennies for my breakfast.

176
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,779
It was a lot of money but they deserved it.

177
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,590
Then I lit my pipe.

178
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:41,880
The next day we were crossing a meadow when
Sandy shouted, "Defend yourself!

179
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,430
Danger!"

180
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,660
Six armed knights were in the shade of a tree.

181
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,880
They attacked me.

182
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,960
I lit my pipe.

183
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,250
They suddenly stopped.

184
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,270
Sandy said they thought I was a dragon.

185
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:08,340
Then she told them to go to King Arthur's
court and surrender, becoming my knights.

186
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,290
Sandy told me the story of the knights.

187
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,120
It was very long.

188
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,310
While she was speaking, I remembered the girl
I loved in Connecticut and I was sad.

189
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:26,720
But then we saw a big castle.

190
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,750
Outside the castle, I met one of my knights.

191
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,850
He was my soap missionary.

192
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,089
He went about selling soap because I wanted
a cleaner country.

193
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:43,380
He didn't manage to sell soap in that castle
because someone died while they were using

194
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,300
it.

195
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,800
He told me the owner was Morgan le Fay, King
Arthur's sister.

196
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,330
Her husband was King Uriens.

197
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:59,529
Their kingdom was so small you could stand
in the middle of it and throw a brick into

198
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:02,670
the next kingdom.

199
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:09,959
Morgan le Fay had a terrible reputation, but
at first, she seemed very kind.

200
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,350
She invited us to have dinner.

201
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:19,160
Then a page touched her and she stabbed him.

202
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,160
She was very bad!

203
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,340
Sandy told her I was 'The Boss' and she was
very frightened of me.

204
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,070
I heard a terrible sound and asked to see
where it came from.

205
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:40,000
As I entered the cell, I saw something I would
never forget.

206
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,250
A young giant of a man was stretched on a
rack.

207
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,320
A poor young woman with a baby was in a corner.

208
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,620
The man had killed a deer, a terrible crime.

209
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,760
I told Morgan to free him and leave me with
the family.

210
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,950
The wife wanted the man to confess.

211
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:10,180
Then Morgan would execute him quickly and
stop his suffering.

212
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:16,120
The man refused because the confession would
give Morgan the right to take away all property

213
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,440
from his wife and leave her with nothing.

214
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:27,019
I thought: "This is a real man, a heart of
gold".

215
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,550
I asked to see her prisoners.

216
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,019
It was terrible.

217
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:38,480
Some were there so long they had gone mad.

218
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,040
A young bride and her husband, separated by
their lord on their wedding night, now didn't

219
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,930
recognize each other.

220
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,190
Morgan le Fay didn't even know who some of
them were.

221
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,510
An old man in his cell could see his home.

222
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,440
He had a wife and five children.

223
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:04,870
Over the years, he had seen five funerals
but he didn't know which member of his family

224
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,750
was still alive.

225
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:12,819
I set all Morgan's prisoners free, except
for one noble.

226
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:15,799
I didn't care about him.

227
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:21,980
The next morning I was very happy to leave
the castle.

228
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,270
Sandy kept telling me stories.

229
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,760
I met my toothbrush missionary.

230
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,600
He was very angry with my stove polish missionary.

231
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,900
Of course, there were no stoves yet, but I
wanted to prepare people for them and teach

232
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,720
them about keeping a tidy home.

233
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,220
We had another chance meeting, with the old
man who had watched the funerals from Morgan's

234
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,120
prison.

235
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,419
He was with his whole family now.

236
00:17:55,419 --> 00:18:00,080
The funerals had been false, a torture invented
by Morgan.

237
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,870
I was happy for him.

238
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,080
Suddenly Sandy said, "The castle!

239
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Look!"

240
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,159
"It isn't a castle, it's a pigsty!"

241
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,170
I said to Sandy.

242
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:22,780
"It wasn't enchanted before," she said.

243
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:31,940
Sandy really believed she saw a castle with
monster guards and captive princesses inside.

244
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:39,600
So I paid the men who guarded the pigs to
go away and rescued the "ladies".

245
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:47,040
Sandy embraced the pigs, believing they were
princesses.

246
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,679
The next day we met some pilgrims on the road.

247
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:59,650
They were going to the Valley of Holiness,
a place with a miraculous stream of water.

248
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,570
Suddenly we saw a terrible sight.

249
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,970
A group of slaves.

250
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,410
Their clothes were dirty and torn.

251
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,880
Their faces were grey.

252
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,280
They were injured from the chains.

253
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,981
A girl fell, and the guards hit her.

254
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:26,000
Then her new owner arrived to take her baby
and her away.

255
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,200
She cried, and a man tried to embrace her,
it was her husband.

256
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,000
They were separated.

257
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,140
They would never see each other again.

258
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,990
I still feel terrible when I think about that
scene today.

259
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,620
I will never forget it.

260
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:53,450
We arrived at a pub where I met a knight I
knew.

261
00:19:53,450 --> 00:20:01,549
He was my "stove pipe" hat missionary: he
wore armour with a hat instead of a helmet.

262
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:08,690
He said there was a terrible problem in the
Valley of Holiness: the water had stopped!

263
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:15,200
Merlin was there now, he was trying to make
the water come back with magic.

264
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:27,760
I sent a message to Clarence: Send me pipes,
extensions and two trained assistants.

265
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,660
CHAPTER THREE
The Holy Fountain

266
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,380
We travelled quickly with the pilgrims and
arrived in the Valley of Holiness before sunset.

267
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,370
All the people there were sad.

268
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,210
I met the abbot.

269
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,240
"Hurry my son!" he said.

270
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,480
"Save our valley or we will lose two hundred
years of work.

271
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,429
But do not use the devil's magic!"

272
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:01,630
"I use only God's work," I said.

273
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,150
"But what about Merlin?"

274
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,370
"He promised too.

275
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,620
But please, try immediately," answered the
abbot.

276
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,690
"I can't," I said.

277
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,740
"It is not fair.

278
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,669
I must wait until Merlin stops."

279
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:23,530
I asked to see the well.

280
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:28,650
I made an inspection and realized that the
well probably had a leak.

281
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:34,270
I went down the well and saw there was a big
hole at the bottom.

282
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:40,350
That was the problem, but I had to wait for
Merlin to stop.

283
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,720
The next day I decided to visit some hermits.

284
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,110
They were all very dirty and very strange.

285
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,690
One had chains.

286
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,900
One was naked and black with dirt.

287
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,830
One stood on a pillar and moved up and down.

288
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:04,360
Eventually I attached a sewing machine to
him and made shirts.

289
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,970
It made a lot of money.

290
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:15,500
Soon Merlin decided to give in, so with my
assistants I repaired the well and put in

291
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,670
a pump.

292
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:22,160
Then we made a tunnel for the water to flow
outside too.

293
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,080
I put down some fireworks.

294
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,760
I called everyone and started the miracle.

295
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:35,950
I said very big, strange, invented words.

296
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,060
Everyone thought they were magic.

297
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:49,190
Then I lit the fireworks, and the water started
to flow it was a huge miracle!

298
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,580
Soon after, I asked if the monks wanted a
bath.

299
00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:00,120
They were horrified: baths were forbidden
because people having baths stopped the water

300
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,190
in the past.

301
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:07,730
But I told them it was a different problem
that stopped the water, not the bath.

302
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:13,450
They were very happy and loved the swimming
pool I built for them to wash in.

303
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:22,750
One day I was walking in the valley when I
heard a voice in a cave.

304
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,340
It was one of my telephone operators!

305
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:32,200
I asked to speak to Camelot and learned that
the King and the Court were coming to visit

306
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,000
the Valley.

307
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:43,360
When I returned to the monastery, I had a
horrible surprise: a new giant magician!

308
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,289
He said he knew what everyone was doing: the
Emperor of the East, the Supreme Lord of Inde

309
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:53,570
and others.

310
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,360
Everyone believed him and was very surprised.

311
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,299
I asked:

312
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:03,049
"What is my right hand doing?"

313
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,960
He didn't know!

314
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,460
He was very worried.

315
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,120
No one had ever asked that sort of simple
question before.

316
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,190
Then I asked, "What is the king doing?"

317
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,770
He answered, "He is sleeping in the palace."

318
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,400
Everyone was amazed, but I answered.

319
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,880
"He isn't!

320
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,350
He is travelling by horse!

321
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,340
He will be here in three days!"

322
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:40,000
No one believed me, but I checked every day
with my telephone operators, and when the

323
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,840
king was arriving, I announced this to the
abbot: people immediately stopped believing

324
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,370
the false magician and believed me again.

325
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:58,650
It is not difficult to be a successful magician
in King Arthur's time, but it is hard work

326
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,940
and you can't rest!

327
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:07,170
When the King arrived, he told me about his
new army.

328
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,470
I was not happy.

329
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:14,130
I had a military school and I wanted to make
my students officers.

330
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:20,650
But when we had an examination of the candidates,
the nobles did not accept my men.

331
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:26,400
They only accepted other nobles, who were
stupid and ignorant.

332
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,940
My men were very well prepared but they were
not noble.

333
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,179
Another problem with these people and their
strange ideas!

334
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:46,210
I had another idea: a new regiment consisting
only of nobles, to keep them happy.

335
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,200
And then the rest of the army made up of my
soldiers, the real army.

336
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,289
Everyone was happy.

337
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:59,740
I decided to go on a trip through the kingdom
to see the general conditions.

338
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,140
The King wanted to come too, and told me to
wait.

339
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,620
He had to do his ceremony.

340
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,820
He touched the sick and cured them.

341
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,770
Often it worked.

342
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:18,590
People were convinced his touch was magic,
and their belief made them better.

343
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,560
The king did his best, he was a good man.

344
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:28,200
The ceremony was very long and I was bored.

345
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,400
He touched every sick person and gave them
a coin.

346
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,900
I decided to stop the gold coins and made
copper ones.

347
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,750
This saved the kingdom a lot of money.

348
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:48,169
During the touching ceremony, I saw another
of my innovations, a newspaper!

349
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:52,820
I was very happy with the result.

350
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:59,110
It wasn't perfect, and I wanted to improve
it, but it was good enough and everyone was

351
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,600
amazed by it.

352
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,350
I was as proud of it as a mother of her new
baby.

353
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:14,140
I suggested the king tell Queen Guenever of
our departure but he was sad.

354
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:22,409
"When Sir Launcelot is here, the Queen doesn't
notice if I arrive or depart," he said.

355
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:24,080
I was sorry for him.

356
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:31,720
I thought the Queen was beautiful but not
very intelligent.

357
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:39,850
Later that evening I helped the king to dress
himself as a peasant, ready for our journey

358
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,150
into his kingdom.

359
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:49,380
I cut his hair short: nobles had long hair
cut short at the front, the peasants had short

360
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,520
hair, and the slaves had long hair.

361
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,529
I cut his hair like a peasant and gave him
a long, simple tunic.

362
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:03,330
We left early in the morning.

363
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,600
On the road, some noble people passed.

364
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,120
I had to tell the king to bow to them.

365
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,710
He didn't know how to behave.

366
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:18,559
He wasn't good at bowing and one of the nobles
tried to hit him.

367
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,360
I stepped in and he whipped me instead.

368
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,210
Next, we met two knights.

369
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,350
The king did not move off the road.

370
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:34,910
He didn't understand that peasants had no
rights, he believed the knights would ride

371
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,900
round him.

372
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,970
They didn't.

373
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:42,330
They insulted the king who answered.

374
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,289
This made them furious.

375
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:49,640
To save the situation I insulted them more.

376
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:57,730
They turned and started to attack us, so I
threw some dynamite at them and they exploded!

377
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,299
The king thought it was magic.

378
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:03,230
I told him I could not repeat it another time.

379
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,580
He said:

380
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,679
"You must read my thoughts and stop me before
I make mistakes."

381
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,970
"I can't," I answered.

382
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,590
He was amazed.

383
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:20,980
"But Merlin can!" he said.

384
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,530
I realized I had made a mistake.

385
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,610
I said:

386
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,660
"Merlin can see a few minutes into the future.

387
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:34,120
I can see centuries into the future.

388
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,049
I don't bother with small prophecy like Merlin."

389
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:42,370
He was convinced.

390
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:52,429
CHAPTER FOUR
The Yankee and the King

391
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:58,250
On the morning of the fourth day, when the
sun was coming up, I decided to drill the

392
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,740
king.

393
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:05,350
"Sir," I said, "you are too like a soldier,
a lord.

394
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,429
This is not good.

395
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:12,860
You must try to look poor and miserable."

396
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:17,350
The king tried to walk like a poor peasant
but he was not convincing.

397
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,390
He had too much spirit.

398
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:27,730
I said to him: "What will you say when we
ask for hospitality in a house?"

399
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,320
"Varlet, give me what you have!"

400
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,520
answered the king.

401
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,929
"No, you cannot say "varlet", you are not
a lord!"

402
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:40,020
I answered.

403
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,710
"You must say "brother"."

404
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:47,370
The king tried his best.

405
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,559
"Give me the sack," he said.

406
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:56,510
"I must try to stoop under weights that are
not honourable."

407
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,179
He tried, but it was very difficult for him
to stoop.

408
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,330
I thought about work.

409
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:08,510
I thought about the people who believe that
a day of intellectual work is hard.

410
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:13,110
They don't understand that work is physical.

411
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:21,510
It is silly to pay higher wages to intellectuals
than to people who work with their bodies.

412
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,760
We saw a very small, poor house in the distance.

413
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,929
We arrived in the middle of the afternoon.

414
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,649
There was no sign of life.

415
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:36,340
Everything looked ruined and there was no
living thing.

416
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:43,360
We pushed the door open and saw some forms
in the dark.

417
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,340
One sat up.

418
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,090
"Have mercy!"

419
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,110
cried a woman.

420
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,890
"They have taken everything.

421
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,149
There is nothing here."

422
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:59,970
"I do not want anything, poor woman," I said.

423
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:04,270
"Then you are not a priest or a lord?"

424
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,530
she asked.

425
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:10,630
"No, I am a stranger," I replied.

426
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,940
"Let me come in and help you.

427
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,600
You are sick and in trouble," I said.

428
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,320
"Go away," she said.

429
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,640
"We are in trouble with the lord and the church
and we have the smallpox.

430
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,529
You must go away."

431
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:35,740
I told the king to go away, but he refused.

432
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:41,529
"The king does not know fear, and has no trouble
with the church.

433
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:47,510
I must stay and help, it is the duty of a
knight," he said.

434
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,669
We gave the woman water.

435
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:58,130
"Please, go up that ladder and tell me what
you see," said the woman.

436
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:03,740
The king went up the ladder, which led to
another part of the little hut.

437
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,650
On his way, he noticed a man.

438
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:13,179
"Is that your husband sleeping?" he asked.

439
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:18,120
"No, he died three hours ago.

440
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,059
Now he is at peace," said the woman.

441
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:29,899
The king climbed the ladder and came back
with a poor girl of fifteen.

442
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:31,360
She was dying.

443
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,230
He said there was another girl, who was already
dead.

444
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:42,730
He lay the girl next to the woman who sat
with her until she died.

445
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:48,670
I brought the other child to lie next to her.

446
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,809
The woman told us her story.

447
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:59,039
They were persecuted by the lord and the church
who made them work and took all their property.

448
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,810
They had nothing to eat, and their three sons
were unjustly in prison for a theft they had

449
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,429
not committed.

450
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:09,429
Then they got smallpox.

451
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:14,200
At midnight, they were all dead.

452
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,659
We continued our journey and came to a small
house.

453
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:23,049
We asked for hospitality and the couple who
lived there was kind.

454
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:30,000
I spoke to the man and discovered that he
did not like the injustice of the country's

455
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,179
laws.

456
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:34,210
I liked him.

457
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:41,049
We stayed for some days with the man whose
name was Marco, and his wife Phyllis.

458
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:46,859
I said the king was a farmer and I was his
assistant.

459
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:51,720
One day I decided to have a special lunch
at Marco's house.

460
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:58,680
I invited a lot of people, all the craftsmen
of the town.

461
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,529
Marco was terrified by the cost, which was
too much for him.

462
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:05,809
I paid for everything.

463
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:09,500
Everyone thought I was very rich.

464
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,270
At the lunch, I tried to explain economics
to the men.

465
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:22,880
I told them that in my part of the country,
people earned less but everything cost less.

466
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,759
So in my part of the country people were better
off.

467
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,440
They couldn't understand.

468
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,249
"But we earn double what you earn.

469
00:35:33,249 --> 00:35:35,329
This is better!"

470
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:36,739
insisted one man.

471
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:42,220
"But we pay less than half of what you pay.

472
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:48,730
Therefore we have more money and can buy more
things," I replied.

473
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:54,059
They could not understand the idea, which
was new to them, and I could not explain it

474
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,299
to them.

475
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:59,099
I was very disappointed.

476
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,299
So I tried another subject.

477
00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:07,960
I talked about crime and punishment, and I
said they were committing crimes by earning

478
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,519
more than was allowed by their lord.

479
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:13,260
This was a mistake.

480
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:18,250
I thought we could laugh about it but they
were terrified.

481
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:23,099
They didn't know me and they were worried
that I wanted to report them.

482
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:29,180
The king started talking about farming, but
he knew nothing about it.

483
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,469
The men started to say that he was mad.

484
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:38,670
"One wants to betray us and the other is mad!"

485
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,069
they shouted.

486
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:48,769
A fight started and the king was delighted,
but I made him escape.

487
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:50,950
We were in danger!

488
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:56,340
We ran to the woods and hid in a tree, but
the people found us and wanted to kill us.

489
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:02,859
Luckily, a noble arrived and saved us.

490
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:08,459
He took us with him to a nearby town where
he had business.

491
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:11,799
Then we had another terrible surprise.

492
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:16,020
He took us to the market and sold us as slaves.

493
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:21,789
He sold the king for seven dollars and me
for nine.

494
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:22,789
I was offended.

495
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:27,180
I was worth at least fifteen and the king
twelve.

496
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:34,910
We were chained to the slaves by the master
who was hard and cruel.

497
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:39,309
We got lost in the snow and five people died.

498
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:45,660
Then a woman arrived screaming and tried to
find protection with us.

499
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,300
The people in her village said she was a witch
and wanted to burn her.

500
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,130
Our slave master helped them.

501
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,999
We could not help her.

502
00:37:55,999 --> 00:38:04,269
Our master was angry about the dead slaves
and revenged himself on this poor woman.

503
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:07,390
Then we saw a procession.

504
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:12,339
A young girl of eighteen was sitting on a
coffin in a cart.

505
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:13,339
She had a baby.

506
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:19,509
With her was a priest who told her story.

507
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:22,250
She was a young wife and mother.

508
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:27,450
Then the army took her husband away to be
a soldier.

509
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:32,280
She had no work and was starving with her
baby.

510
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,450
So she stole a small piece of linen.

511
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:38,970
The judge decided to hang her.

512
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:45,410
The owner of the linen felt so bad he committed
suicide.

513
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:53,469
She cried and held her baby, but the priest,
who was very kind to her, made a speech against

514
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:58,930
the laws and the sentence, and promised to
look after the baby.

515
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:07,089
There was gratitude in her face when she died.

516
00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:14,869
CHAPTER FIVE
War!

517
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:17,319
I had a plan to escape.

518
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:25,420
I had to wait for many weeks, but in London,
my chance finally came.

519
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,070
Immediately things went wrong.

520
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:31,209
I couldn't get the king's chains off!

521
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:33,859
The slave master interrupted me.

522
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:39,869
When he went outside, I followed him and attacked
him in the dark.

523
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:42,950
But the police arrested me and put me in jail.

524
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,160
I said that I was a noble's servant.

525
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,779
They were afraid of the nobles and let me
go.

526
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:55,900
Then I discovered that the other slaves had
killed the slave master.

527
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,960
They were all in prison, condemned to death!

528
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:09,759
I found a telegraph station and sent a message
to Clarence - Send knights to save the King

529
00:40:09,759 --> 00:40:13,849
and I, they want to hang us!

530
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:16,180
Tomorrow!

531
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,049
Everyone in London was looking for me.

532
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:23,279
They took the slaves about London to recognize
me.

533
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:26,430
Unfortunately, one of them saw me.

534
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:31,339
They took me to the other slaves and decided
to hang us that day.

535
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:35,799
The knights would never arrive in time.

536
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:39,039
It was too late.

537
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,559
They took us to the execution place.

538
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,369
The King tried to say who he was, but everyone
laughed at him.

539
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:51,059
They started to hang the slaves.

540
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:55,519
Then they started to put the rope round the
king's neck.

541
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,349
It was dreadful.

542
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:01,180
I couldn't move.

543
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:05,349
Suddenly a grand sight!

544
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:11,609
Five hundred knights in armour - on bicycles!

545
00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:15,680
Sir Launcelot and the knights saved the king.

546
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,019
Clarence was very happy.

547
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:22,190
"What a surprise, eh?" he said.

548
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:27,779
"The boys practised for a long time!"

549
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:31,599
Soon I was home again in Camelot.

550
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,400
I had to fight Sir Sagramor in a tournament.

551
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,599
Everyone came to see it.

552
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,819
The knights all supported Sir Sagramor.

553
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:44,740
Merlin did some magic to protect him.

554
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,920
I only had Clarence to support me.

555
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,079
We started the fight.

556
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,660
Sir Sagramor was in full armour but I was
wearing light clothes.

557
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:03,230
Everyone thought I was ridiculous, but I could
move fast and avoid him.

558
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,460
He couldn't catch me.

559
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,190
He got very angry and wanted to kill me.

560
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,390
I used my lasso.

561
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:17,089
They didn't know about cowboys and were amazed.

562
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:22,940
I pulled Sir Sagramor off his horse and won
the fight.

563
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,859
But Merlin stole my lasso and Sir Sagramor
wanted to fight again.

564
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:32,259
I shot him with a gun.

565
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,069
Everyone was shocked.

566
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:36,279
They thought it was magic.

567
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:42,579
The knights were angry Five hundred of them
attacked me all at once.

568
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:48,059
I shot some and the others escaped.

569
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:50,420
Everyone was afraid of me.

570
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,920
For three years, I improved the country.

571
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,119
It was happy, civilised, with more money.

572
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,220
Slavery was illegal.

573
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:07,549
I wanted a republic but decided to wait until
King Arthur died.

574
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:12,349
Then one day my child got sick!

575
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:14,099
I was married to Sandy.

576
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:21,849
I had married her because it was polite, but
then I realized I loved her.

577
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,400
I was totally happy with her.

578
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,369
We had a daughter.

579
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:29,109
Now she was sick.

580
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:35,829
Sir Launcelot, a very kind man, helped Sandy
and I to look after her.

581
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:44,529
Then we decided to take her to the sea for
her health and sailed to France.

582
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:50,619
When there was no news I sailed back - everything
was a disaster.

583
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:58,809
Clarence explained that the king was dead,
Guenever was a nun, the knights were fighting

584
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:01,959
and the Church wanted to dominate the land.

585
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:04,309
We had to fight!

586
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:07,809
It was time for the revolution!

587
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:11,789
We declared a republic, and the knights came
to fight us.

588
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:17,759
We hid in a cave and put dynamite everywhere.

589
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:25,049
There were only fifty-four of us, and twenty
five thousand of them, but when they attacked,

590
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:30,529
we electrocuted them and then made them explode.

591
00:44:30,529 --> 00:44:33,130
We won!

592
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:35,769
Postscript by Clarence

593
00:44:35,769 --> 00:44:39,940
I must finish the story.

594
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,219
The Boss made a mistake.

595
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:49,279
He went to offer help to some injured knights
but one of them recognized him and stabbed

596
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,039
him.

597
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:56,499
Then we realized that our cook was Merlin
in disguise.

598
00:44:56,499 --> 00:45:02,339
Merlin did some terrible magic and now The
Boss is sleeping.

599
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:08,109
He will never wake again.

600
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:09,739
Final Postscript by Mark Twain

601
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:13,799
At dawn I stopped reading.

602
00:45:13,799 --> 00:45:18,269
I went to the stranger's room and knocked
on the door.

603
00:45:18,269 --> 00:45:21,609
There was no answer.

604
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:23,040
He was delirious.

605
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,280
He spoke.

606
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,750
"Sandy, is that you?

607
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:35,269
At last, now I can go back to you and our
daughter!

608
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:39,239
It was terrible without you!

609
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,760
I am in the wrong century.

610
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,760
A trumpet!

611
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,449
It is the King!..."

612
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:52,369
He never finished his sentence.

613
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:52,869
- THE END -
