CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,280
The Bet

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Professor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen's 
appearance was as strange as his name.  

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,760
He was thin with the thin shoulders of a 
student and his face was extremely pale.  

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,240
His eyes were the eyes of a man who studies 
little things. They were always half-closed  

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,840
in concentration. Although he wore thick 
glasses you could see that his eyes were blue.  

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,520
But his strangest feature was his abnormally 
large forehead, on top of which sat a crown  

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,480
of yellow hair. Together all these things gave 
him a bizarre, almost grotesque personality.

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,800
Professor Van Dusen's family came from Germany. 
Many of his ancestors had been famous scientists;  

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:01,120
he was the logical result, the mastermind. And 
logic was his passion. He believed that two and  

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,520
two always equal four, except in unusual 
cases, when they may equal three or Five.  

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,920
He believed that all things 
that start must go somewhere,  

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,360
and he was able to concentrate all the mental 
force of his ancestors to solve any problem.

14
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,320
The public knew Van Dusen as The Thinking Machine 
and perhaps this phrase described him best of all.  

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,720
He spent all his time in his small 
laboratory where he invented brilliant  

16
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,480
theories that shocked scientists and 
had a profound effect on the world.

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,960
The Thinking Machine didn't have many 
visitors. When people did come to see  

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,360
him they were usually scientists. Two of these 
men, Dr Charles Ransome and Alfred Fielding  

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,840
visited him one evening to discuss some theory 
(what it was exactly is of no importance).

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,520
"That is impossible," said Dr Ransome.

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,360
"Nothing is impossible," 
said The Thinking Machine.  

22
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,160
"The mind is master of all things. When science 
understands this, it will be a great day."

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
"What about the airship?" asked Dr Ransome.

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,280
"That's not impossible at all," said The 
Thinking Machine. "It will be invented soon.  

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,240
I would do it myself, but 
unfortunately I'm too busy."

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,160
Dr Ransome laughed.

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,280
"I've heard you say things like that before," 
he said. "But they mean nothing. The mind may be  

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,800
master of the material world, but there are some 
problems that cannot be solved by thought alone."

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,240
"Give me an example," 
demanded The Thinking Machine.

30
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,240
Dr Ransome thought for a moment as he smoked.

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,520
"Well, what about the walls of a prison?" 
he replied. "No man can escape from a  

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,560
cell just by thinking about it. If he 
could, there would be no prisoners."  

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,920
He continued. "Let's imagine a case. A cell 
for prisoners who are condemned to death.  

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,240
These men will do anything to try to escape. 
Imagine you were in that cell. Could you escape?"

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,880
"Certainly," said The Thinking Machine.

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,240
"Of course," said Mr Fielding, "you 
could destroy the cell with an explosive,  

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,760
but if you are a prisoner inside 
the cell you can't have that."

38
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,320
"I don't need an explosive," 
said The Thinking Machine.  

39
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,560
"I would be just like any other prisoner and 
I would still be able to leave the cell."

40
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,680
"You could escape only if you entered 
it with tools," said Dr Ransome.

41
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,960
The Thinking Machine was visibly irritated.

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,480
"Lock me in any cell in any prison anywhere 
at any time, wearing only normal clothes, and  

43
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,680
I'll escape in a week," he declared. Dr Ransome 
was interested. Mr. Fielding lit a new cigar.

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,760
"You're saying that you could escape from the 
cell just by thinking about it?" Ransome asked.

45
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,800
"I could get out."

46
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
"Are you serious?"

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
"Certainly, I'm serious."

48
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Dr Ransome and Mr Fielding 
were silent for a long time.

49
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,640
"Would you like to try it?" 
asked Mr Fielding finally.

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,240
"Certainly," said Professor 
Van Dusen and added ironically,  

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,120
"I have done more ridiculous things than that 
to convince men of less important facts."

52
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,160
Of course it was an absurd thing 
but they decided it at that moment.

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,920
"To begin now." said Dr Ransome.

54
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,760
"I'd prefer tomorrow," said The 
Thinking Machine, "because..."

55
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,800
"No, now!" said Mr Fielding. "You 
will be locked in a cell with no  

56
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,960
chance to communicate with 
friends. You will receive exactly  

57
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,960
the same attention as a real prisoner, a man 
condemned to death. Do you still agree to do it?"

58
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,760
"All right. Now, if you want," 
said The Thinking Machine,  

59
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,280
and he stood up. "The 
death-cell in Chisholm Prison?"

60
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,640
"Fine."

61
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,400
"And what will you wear?"

62
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,400
"Very little," said The Thinking Machine. 
"Shoes, long socks, trousers and a shirt."

63
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
"The guards will search you, of course."

64
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,640
"They must treat me like any other 
prisoner," said The Thinking Machine.

65
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,520
And so they made the arrangements. They had to 
obtain permission for the experiment but all three  

66
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,000
of them wore important men and everything 
was finalized with a few telephone calls.  

67
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,200
The prison governors could not understand 
why Professor Van Dusen wanted to do it.  

68
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,400
But one thing was certain. They had 
never had such an important prisoner.

69
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,520
The Thinking Machine dressed himself in the 
clothes that he was going to wear in prison,  

70
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,800
and called his housekeeper.

71
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,640
"Martha," he said, "it is now twenty-seven 
minutes past nine. I am going away.  

72
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,080
One week from tonight at half-past 
nine, these gentlemen and one or two  

73
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,800
others will have dinner with me here. 
Remember Dr Ransome likes carrots."

74
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,880
A driver took the three men to Chisholm Prison.  

75
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,920
The warden was waiting for them. He understood 
only that Professor Van Dusen was going to be his  

76
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,160
prisoner for one week. He was not a criminal, but 
he must be treated just like any other prisoner.

77
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,840
"Search him," said Dr Ransome.

78
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,880
The guards searched The Thinking 
Machine but they didn't find anything.  

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
The pockets of his trousers were empty 
and his shirt didn't have any pockets.  

80
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,880
They took off his shoes and socks 
and looked inside them. Nothing.

81
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,160
Dr Ransome regarded Van Dusen's 
weak body and his colorless face.  

82
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
He was suddenly sorry about his idea.

83
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,840
"Are you sure you want to do this?" he asked.

84
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,480
"Would you believe me if I didn't do 
it?" The Thinking Machine replied.

85
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:53,760
"No."

86
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,680
"All right, I'll do it."

87
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,920
Ransome didn't like the arrogance in Van Dusen's 
voice. His sympathy for the man disappeared. He  

88
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,760
decided that the experiment was a good thing. 
It would teach The Thinking Machine a lesson.

89
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,040
"Will it be possible for him to communicate 
with anyone outside the prison?" he asked.

90
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,640
"No. It will be absolutely impossible," said the 
warden. "He will not have anything to write with."

91
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,480
"And the guards, will they send messages for him?"

92
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,240
"Not one word," said the warden.  

93
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,440
"They will tell me anything he says and 
they will give me anything he gives them."

94
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
"Good," said Mr Fielding.

95
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
"Of course if he does not escape 
in a week," said Dr Ransome,  

96
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,000
"and asks to leave, you will let him go?"

97
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,480
"I understand," said the warden.

98
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,520
Then The Thinking Machine spoke.

99
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,120
"I have three requests," he said, "I 
would like some toothpaste and also  

100
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,600
one five-dollar and two ten- dollar bills"

101
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,560
"Could he bribe your guards 
for twenty-five dollars?"

102
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,360
Not even for twenty-five hundred dollars."

103
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,240
"In that case, give him the 
money," said Mr Fielding.

104
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,840
"And what is the third request?" asked Dr Ransome.

105
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,560
"Could somebody clean my shoes?"

106
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,000
The three men looked very surprised. This 
last request seemed completely absurd,  

107
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,960
but they agreed to it anyway. After this, 
they took The Thinking Machine to his cell.  

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,080
They walked down a long corridor 
and stopped at the third steel door.

109
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,680
"Here is Cell 13," said the warden. "This 
is where condemned killers are kept.  

110
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,360
No one can leave it without my permission. 
No one in it can communicate with anyone  

111
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,160
outside. It is very near my office and I 
can hear any noise that comes from it."

112
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,480
"Is this cell all right, gentlemen?" 
asked The Thinking Machine.

113
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,200
"Yes, it's perfect," replied 
Fielding and Ransome together.

114
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,720
The guard opened the door and The Thinking 
Machine walked into the dark room.  

115
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,800
No sooner was he inside than 
the warden closed the door  

116
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,920
and locked it with a double lock. Ransome 
heard a noise from inside the cell.

117
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,440
"What is that noise?" he asked through the bars.

118
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,680
"Rats - the cell is full of rats," 
replied The Thinking Machine.

119
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,680
The three men said goodnight and were turning 
to go when The Thinking Machine called:

120
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
"What time is it exactly, warden?"

121
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,880
"Seventeen minutes past eleven."

122
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,640
"Thanks. I will see you all 
in your office at half-past  

123
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
eight one week from this evening," 
said The Thinking Machine.

124
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,200
"And if you do not?"

125
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,840
"There is no possibility of that."
 
 

126
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,960
CHAPTER TWO

127
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,200
Chisholm Prison

128
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,880
Chisholm prison was a large building. It was 
four floors high and stood in the centre of a  

129
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,040
large open space. The wall around it was 
six metres high and impossible to climb.  

130
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,240
Even if a man managed to escape from his 
cell, he could not pass over the wall.

131
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,400
The yard around the building was eight metres 
wide on all sides. This was the distance from  

132
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,160
the prison building to the wall. During the 
day, prisoners used the yard to do exercises.  

133
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,440
But it was not for those prisoners in Cell 13.

134
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,160
There were always four armed guards in the 
yard, one for each side of the building.

135
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,480
At night strong lights 
illuminated the yard and the wall.  

136
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,000
The wires that carried electricity to these 
lights ran up the walls of the building.

137
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,960
The Thinking Machine saw and 
understood all these things.  

138
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:04,160
He had to stand on his bed to see out of the 
small barred window. It was the morning after  

139
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,280
his incarceration. He soon realised that 
somewhere on the other side of the wall  

140
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,600
there was a river because he could hear the 
sound of a boat and saw a river bird in the sky.  

141
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,760
From the same direction he heard the sound 
of children playing baseball, so he knew  

142
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,840
that there was a children's playground 
between the prison wall and the river.

143
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,600
No man had ever escaped from Chisholm 
Prison and it was easy to see why.  

144
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,880
The walls of the cell were perfectly solid 
and the bars on the window were new. And in  

145
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,080
any case the window itself was 
too small to escape through.

146
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,920
But this didn't discourage The Thinking Machine.  

147
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,600
He looked up at the light and saw how the wire 
went from it to the wall of the prison building.  

148
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,160
He realised that the wire passed near the 
window of his cell. That could be useful.

149
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,360
Cell 13 was on the same 
floor as the prison offices.  

150
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,440
The Thinking Machine couldn't see the ground 
through the window of his cell. However,  

151
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:19,520
there were only four steps up to the office floor. 
Therefore the cell must be near the ground. Good.

152
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,440
The Thinking Machine remembered how he had come to 
the cell. First there was the outside guard's room  

153
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,960
which formed part of the wall, next to the prison 
gates. There was always one guard at these gates  

154
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,840
who let people come into the prison and then 
let them out again when the warden told him to.  

155
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,320
The warden's office was in the prison building. 
From the yard you had to pass through a solid  

156
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,080
steel door to get to it. The door had only 
one small hole in it to see who was there.  

157
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,400
Then between the office and Cell 13 there 
was a heavy wooden door and two steel doors  

158
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,840
in the corridors of the prison. Then, of 
course, there was the door of Cell 13.

159
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:09,280
"There are seven doors between Cell 13 and 
freedom," thought The Thinking Machine. "It  

160
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:15,760
will not be easy. But there are advantages. I 
am alone here. Nobody looks at what I am doing.

161
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,680
There is one guard who brings my food three 
times a day, at six o'clock in the morning,  

162
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,800
at noon, then again at six in the afternoon.

163
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,120
And then there is the inspection 
at nine o'clock. But that is all."

164
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,280
There was nothing, absolutely nothing in his 
cell except a bed that was strongly made and  

165
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:44,000
impossible to dismantle. There was no chair, 
no table, no cup or fork or spoon. Nothing.  

166
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,480
The guard watched him while he ate and took away 
his plate and spoon as soon as he had finished.

167
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,240
The Thinking Machine considered all these facts 
very carefully. Then he began an examination  

168
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,680
of his cell. He examined the stones in the 
walls and roof and the cement between them.  

169
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,760
He walked over the floor many times but it was  

170
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,560
solid cement. After the examination he sat 
on his bed and thought for a long time.  

171
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,000
Because Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van 
Dusen had something to think about.

172
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,960
Suddenly, he was disturbed by a rat which 
ran across his foot and disappeared into a  

173
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,720
dark corner of the cell. The Thinking 
Machine looked hard into the corner.  

174
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,200
After some time he saw several pairs 
of yellow eyes looking back at him.

175
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,720
Then for the first time The Thinking Machine 
noticed the bottom of his cell door. There was  

176
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,920
a space of about five centimeters between the 
steel bar and the floor. The Thinking Machine  

177
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,320
walked into the corner where the rats were, but 
he continued to look at the door. The rats were  

178
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,720
afraid and tried to escape. There was the sound of 
running feet and several squeaks and then silence.

179
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,040
None of the rats had gone out the 
door, yet the cell was now empty.  

180
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,560
Therefore there must be another way out 
of the cell, even if it was very small.  

181
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,360
He got down on his hands and knees and began 
to look for the opening. Finally he found it.  

182
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:36,400
It was a small circular hole in the floor about 
four centimeters in diameter. "So this is how  

183
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:43,920
the rats escaped. Interesting." He put his hand 
in the hole. It seemed to be an old drainpipe.

184
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,240
The Thinking Machine sat on 
the bed and thought for an  

185
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,080
hour. Then he looked once 
more outside his cell window.  

186
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,040
One of the outside guards stood directly opposite, 
beside the wall. He was looking at the window of  

187
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,680
Cell 13 when The Thinking Machine's large head 
appeared. But the Professor didn't see the guard.

188
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,600
At twelve o'clock the Cell 13 guard 
brought The Thinking Machine his food.  

189
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,680
It was horrible but The 
Thinking Machine didn't mind.  

190
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,480
He wasn't interested in food. He spoke 
to the guard, who watched him as he ate.

191
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,560
"Have they made any modifications here in the 
last few years?" asked The Thinking Machine.

192
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,360
"Not really," said the guard. "They 
built the new wall four years ago."

193
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,400
"Have they done anything to the prison building?"

194
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,120
"Well, they painted the outside. And  

195
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,560
then seven years ago they had a 
new plumbing system installed."

196
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,880
"Ah, I see," said the prisoner. 
"How far is the river over there?"

197
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,840
"About a hundred metres. The boys have a 
baseball ground between the wall and the river."

198
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,560
The Thinking Machine had nothing more to 
say, but when the guard was ready to go  

199
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,560
he asked for some water.

200
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,920
"I get very thirsty here," he explained. 
"Could I have some water in a cup please?"

201
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,240
"I'll ask the warden," replied 
the guard, and he went away.

202
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,680
Half an hour later he returned with a small cup.

203
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,400
"The warden says you may keep 
this cup," he told the prisoner.  

204
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,080
"But you must show it to me when I ask for it. 
If you break it, I won't give you another one."

205
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,680
"Thank you," said The Thinking 
Machine. "I won't break it."

206
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,480
Two hours later the same guard 
was passing the door of Cell 13.  

207
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,880
He heard a noise and stopped. The Thinking 
Machine was on his hands and knees  

208
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,720
in a corner of the cell. There was the sound 
of several squeaks. The guard watched him.

209
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,160
"Ah, I've got you," he heard the prisoner say.

210
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
"What have you got?" said the guard.

211
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,440
"One of these rats," he replied. "See?" The 
guard saw a rat in The Thinking Machine's hands.  

212
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,800
The prisoner carried it towards the 
light. "It's a water rat," he said.

213
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,760
"Haven't you got anything better to 
do than catch rats?" asked the guard.

214
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,120
"It's terrible that there 
are rats in this prison,"  

215
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,080
said The Thinking Machine. "Take this one away and 
kill it. There are many more where it came from."

216
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,240
The guard took the rat and killed it. Later 
he told the warden about the incident,  

217
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,000
but the warden only smiled.

218
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,440
Later that afternoon the armed guard in the yard 
outside Cell 13 saw the prisoner look out and  

219
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,960
put a hand through the bars of the window. 
Something white fell slowly to the ground.  

220
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,160
It was a roll of linen from a shirt, 
and wrapped around it was a five-dollar  

221
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,440
bill. The guard looked up at the window 
again but the face was no longer there.

222
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,880
With a smile he took the cloth and the 
five-dollar bill to the warden's office.  

223
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,600
There was something written on the outside 
of the cloth in strange ink. It said:

224
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,800
"Please deliver to Dr Charles Ransome."

225
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,200
"Ha!" said the warden, "His 
first plan of escape has  

226
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,320
failed. But why did he address it to Dr Ransome?"

227
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,040
"And where did he get the pen and 
ink to write with?" added the guard.

228
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,920
The warden looked at the guard and 
the guard looked at the warden.  

229
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,840
There was no easy solution to the mystery. 
The warden studied the writing carefully.

230
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,560
"Well, let's see what he 
wanted to say to Dr Ransome,"  

231
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,840
he said. He unrolled the second piece of linen.

232
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:40,080
"Well, if that - what - what do you think 
of that?" he asked, extremely confused.

233
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
The guard took the piece of linen and read:

234
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:52,000
"Epa cseot d'net niiy awe htto n'si sih. T."
 
 

235
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,920
CHAPTER THREE

236
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,600
A Message from Cell 13

237
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,840
The warden spent an hour trying 
to discover what the message was.  

238
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,720
Why did his prisoner want to talk to Dr Ransome? 
And where had he got the materials to write?  

239
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,480
He examined the linen again. It was a part of 
a white shirt. But what had he written with?  

240
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,720
The warden knew that the prisoner didn't 
have a pen or a pencil. So what had he  

241
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,920
used? The warden decided to investigate. The 
Thinking Machine was his prisoner. "If this  

242
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,040
man is trying to escape by sending coded 
messages," he thought, "I will stop him."

243
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,920
The warden returned to Cell 13. He found 
The Thinking Machine on his hands and knees.  

244
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,320
He was catching rats. The prisoner heard 
the warden and turned to him quickly.

245
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,560
"It's terrible," he said. "These 
rats. There are hundreds of them."

246
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,400
"Other men can live with them," said the warden. 
"Give me your shirt. Here is another one."

247
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,760
"Why?" demanded The Thinking Machine.

248
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,400
"You have attempted to communicate with 
Dr Ransome," said the warden, angrily.  

249
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,640
"As the warden of this prison, I must stop you." 
The Thinking Machine was silent for a moment.

250
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,720
"All right," he said, finally. "Here. Take it."

251
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,960
The warden smiled. The prisoner 
stood up and took off his shirt.  

252
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,640
He gave it to the warden. In exchange, 
the warden gave him a blue prison shirt.  

253
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,560
The warden looked at The Thinking Machine's 
white shirt. He compared the pieces of linen  

254
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,880
he had with the shirt. It was torn in two 
places. The Thinking Machine watched him.

255
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,920
"Did the guard give you those?" he asked.

256
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,160
"Yes, he did," said the warden. "And that 
is the end of your first attempt to escape."  

257
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,040
The Thinking Machine watched the 
warden as he looked at the shirt.  

258
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,920
He saw that there were only two 
pieces missing from it. He smiled.

259
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,840
"What did you write this 
message with?" asked the warden.

260
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,400
"I'm afraid you must discover 
that!" The Thinking Machine said.

261
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,640
The warden became angry but he didn't 
say anything more. He made a very  

262
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,440
careful inspection of the cell and the prisoner, 
but he found nothing. Nothing that The Thinking  

263
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,680
Machine could use as a pen. And the liquid that he 
had used to write the message was also a mystery.  

264
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,200
Finally the warden went out of the cell. He 
took The Thinking Machine's shirt with him.

265
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,800
"Well, he won't escape by writing 
messages on a shirt," the warden thought.

266
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,840
On the third day of his incarceration The 
Thinking Machine tried to bribe the guard  

267
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,040
so that he could escape. The guard brought 
his food and waited outside the cell door.

268
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,960
"The drainpipes of the prison go to the river, 
don't they?" The Thinking Machine asked.

269
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,760
"Yes," said the guard.

270
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,400
"I imagine they are very small?"

271
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,000
"Yes. They are too small to escape through."

272
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,920
There was silence. The Thinking Machine 
finished his food. Then he said:

273
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,040
"You know I'm not a criminal, don't you?"

274
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,160
"Yes."

275
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,080
"And I can leave the prison if I want to?"

276
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,480
"Yes."

277
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,640
"Well, when I came here I 
believed I could escape,"  

278
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,160
said the prisoner. "Will you help 
me if I give you some money?"

279
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,640
The guard was an honest man.

280
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,960
"No," he said.

281
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,320
"Five hundred dollars," said The 
Thinking Machine. "I am not a criminal."

282
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,720
"No," said the guard.

283
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,160
"A thousand?"

284
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,360
"No. If you gave me ten thousand 
dollars, I couldn't get you out.  

285
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,360
To get out you have to pass through seven 
doors and I only have the keys to two."

286
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,840
The guard ran to the warden's office 
and told him about the prisoner's offer.

287
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,880
"Plan number two fails," said the warden and 
smiled. "First a message and then a bribe."

288
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,840
At six o'clock, the guard went to Cell 13 
again to bring food to The Thinking Machine.  

289
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,880
He stopped in the corridor. There was 
a noise coming from inside the cell.  

290
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,000
The guard walked very quietly to the cell door. 
Through the bars he saw The Thinking Machine at  

291
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,840
the window. He was trying to cut through 
the iron bars of the window with a file.

292
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,800
The guard went back to the 
office and told the warden.  

293
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,400
The two men went back to Cell 13, walking 
very quietly. The warden looked into the  

294
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,960
cell and saw The Thinking Machine still 
at the window. He entered the cell.

295
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,920
The Thinking Machine turned round and jumped onto 
the floor. He tried to hide the file in his hand.

296
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,000
"Give it to me," said the warden.

297
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,280
"No," said the prisoner. 
There was anger in his voice.

298
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,880
"Come on. Give it to me."

299
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,800
"No," repeated The Thinking Machine.

300
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,840
"Very well. Search him," 
said the warden to the guard.

301
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,720
The guard searched The Thinking Machine. After 
some minutes he found a piece of steel about five  

302
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,160
centimeters long in the prisoner's trousers. 
A few minutes later he found another piece.  

303
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,760
The guard gave the pieces of steel to 
the warden. The warden looked at them.

304
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,320
"You couldn't cut through the bars 
on the window with these," he said.

305
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,760
"Yes I could," said The Thinking Machine.

306
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,280
"In six months perhaps," said the warden, smiling.

307
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,320
"Just wait, you'll see," 
said The Thinking Machine.

308
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,840
Once more the guard searched the cell. But 
once more they found nothing. The warden  

309
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,800
stood on the bed and looked at the bars of 
the window. He took the bars in his hand  

310
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,960
and tried to move them. They were immovable. 
He smiled and then got down from the bed.

311
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,840
"Forget it, Professor, you will 
never escape from here," he said.

312
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,400
The Thinking Machine said nothing. He just 
sat on the bed with his head in his hands.  

313
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,120
The warden and the guard went out 
of the cell and closed the door.

314
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,360
"He is mad to try and escape," said the warden,  

315
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,240
"but he is very clever. I would like to know 
what he used to write that coded message."

316
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,000
It was four o'clock the next morning when 
a terrible scream resounded through the  

317
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,960
prison. It came from a cell near the centre of the 
building, a sound full of horror and great fear.  

318
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,880
The warden heard it and ran with three of his men 
into the long corridor that went to Cell 13.
 
 

319
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,560
CHAPTER FOUR

320
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,800
A Strange Voice

321
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,080
As they ran they heard the scream again. The white  

322
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,440
faces of prisoners appeared at 
cell doors. They were afraid.

323
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,680
"It's that crazy man in Cell 13." the warden said.

324
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,040
He stopped and looked into the 
cell. "That crazy man in Cell  

325
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,680
13" was sleeping comfortably in his 
bed. They heard the scream again.  

326
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,600
It was coming from somewhere above. The warden 
and the guards went upstairs. There they found  

327
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,960
a man in Cell 43, directly above Cell 13. He was 
sitting in the corner of his cell like a child.

328
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,040
"What's wrong?" demanded the warden.

329
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,640
"Thank God you've come!' said the prisoner.

330
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,960
"What is it?" demanded the warden again.

331
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,840
He opened the door and went into Cell 43. 
The prisoner's face was white with terror.

332
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,440
"Take me out of this cell, 
please take me out," he said.

333
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,360
"What is it?" asked the warden.

334
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,840
"I heard something - something."

335
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,520
"What did you hear?"

336
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,560
"I can't tell you," said the prisoner. "Please  

337
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,080
take me out of this cell - put me 
anywhere - but take me out of here."

338
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,280
"Who is this man?" the warden asked the guard.

339
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,920
"His name is Joseph Ballard," the guard replied.

340
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,360
"And what is his crime?"

341
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,200
"They say he killed a woman with acid."

342
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,040
"But they can't prove it," said the 
prisoner. "They can't prove it!"  

343
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,960
The warden was silent for a minute.

344
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,400
"Listen to me, Ballard," he said, finally.  

345
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,880
"If you heard something, I want 
to know what it was. Now tell me."

346
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,080
"I can't tell you." Ballard was 
crying now. "Where did it come from?"

347
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,160
"I don't know. Everywhere 
- nowhere. I don't know."

348
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,840
"Was it a voice?"

349
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,840
"I can't tell you," said the prisoner. "You 
must tell me," said the warden, angrily.

350
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,080
"It was a voice - but - but - it 
wasn't human," said the prisoner.

351
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,280
"A voice, but not human?" repeated 
the warden. He was confused.

352
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,560
"It was strange and very far away, like a ghost."

353
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,720
"Did it come from inside or outside the prison?"

354
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,000
"It didn't come from anywhere. It was here, 
there, everywhere. I heard it. I heard it!"

355
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,280
For an hour the warden tried to get 
the story, but Ballard became silent  

356
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,720
and didn't say anything more. Finally the 
warden went away. He was very confused.  

357
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:22,160
Ballard sat at his cell door until morning, 
his white face staring through the bars.

358
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,360
It was the fourth day of The 
Thinking Machine's incarceration.  

359
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,800
He stood at his cell window and threw 
another piece of linen to the guard outside.  

360
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:38,160
And once more the guard took it to the warden. 
The warden read the message on it. It said:

361
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,400
"Only three days more."

362
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,760
The warden was not surprised by the message.  

363
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,840
He knew The Thinking Machine meant that there 
were only three days more before he escaped.

364
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:55,600
"But how did he write it?" the warden thought. 
"Where did he find another piece of linen?  

365
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:02,640
Where? How?" He looked at the linen. It 
was white, like the material from a shirt.  

366
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,880
He took The Thinking Machine's shirt and put the 
two original pieces of linen on the torn places.  

367
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,720
The third piece was completely superfluous. But 
it was the same material. "Where did he get it?  

368
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,400
And where - where does he 
get anything to write with?"

369
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,080
Later on the fourth day The Thinking Machine 
spoke to the guard outside his window.

370
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,960
"What day of the month is it?" he asked.

371
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,840
"The fifteenth."

372
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,480
The Thinking Machine made a mental 
astronomical calculation. "Good," he thought.  

373
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,000
"Tonight the moon will not rise before nine 
o'clock." Then he asked another question.

374
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,960
"Who looks after the big lights on the roof?"

375
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,440
"An electrician from the company."

376
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,560
"You have no electricians in the building?"

377
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:52,800
"No."

378
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,840
At the end of the afternoon,  

379
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,440
just before he finished work, the outside 
guard saw The Thinking Machine's head again  

380
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,760
at the window. He had something in his hand which 
he threw to the ground. It was a five-dollar bill.

381
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,280
"That's for you," said the prisoner.

382
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,160
Once again, the guard took it to the warden.

383
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,320
"He said it was for me."

384
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:24,080
"I imagine it's a present from him. I think you 
can accept it," said the warden. Then suddenly he  

385
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:31,200
stopped. "Wait a minute. When the professor went 
into the cell he had one five-dollar bill and two  

386
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,840
ten-dollar bills. There was a five-dollar bill 
with the first message. I have it here. But now  

387
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:44,480
he has given you another five- dollar bill. It's 
impossible. He has only two ten-dollar bills."

388
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,760
"Perhaps somebody changed a ten-dollar 
bill for him," said the guard.

389
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,240
"Perhaps. But tonight we are going to search Cell  

390
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,600
13 again. We are going to search it as 
no cell has ever been searched before."

391
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,080
So that night at three o'clock in the morning 
the warden and his guards searched The Thinking  

392
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,320
Machine's cell again. The warden found the 
hole in the floor. He put his hand into it.  

393
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:20,160
There was something there. He pulled it out. A 
dead rat. He threw it to the floor in disgust.  

394
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,800
But he continued the search. Once more he examined 
the bars on the window but found them to be solid.  

395
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,960
He then examined The Thinking Machine's 
clothes. In his trousers he found some money.

396
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,240
"Five one-dollar bills!" said the 
warden. He was very surprised.

397
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
"That's right," said the prisoner.

398
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,280
"But the... you had two tens 
and a five... how do you do it?"

399
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,480
"That's my business," said The Thinking Machine.

400
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,320
"Did any of my men change this money for you?"

401
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,560
"No."

402
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,240
"Well, do you make it?" asked the warden.

403
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,600
"That's my business," said the prisoner again.

404
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,760
The warden was very angry. He left 
the cell and went back to bed.

405
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,560
About an hour later he heard the scream 
again. He got up and ran immediately to  

406
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,400
Cell 43, where he saw Ballard, his face 
pressed against the bars of the door.

407
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:24,240
"Take me out, take me out," he screamed. "I did 
it. I did it. I killed her. Take me out of here."

408
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,840
"Was it the voice again?" asked the warden.

409
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
"Yes," said Ballard.

410
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,120
"What did it say?"

411
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,840
"Acid - acid - acid!" said the prisoner. "It knew.  

412
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,720
I threw the acid in the woman's 
face and killed her. Oh!"

413
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:47,840
"Acid?" repeated the warden, 
more confused than ever.

414
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,280
CHAPTER FIVE

415
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,760
Countdown to Freedom

416
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,880
On the fifth day of The Thinking 
Machine's incarceration,  

417
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:03,600
the warden looked tired. He wanted this 
thing to finish. He wanted his confusion  

418
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,960
to end. But that day The Thinking Machine 
threw another piece of linen to the guard.  

419
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:17,280
It said "Only two days more". This time 
there was a silver half-dollar with it.

420
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,520
Now the warden knew - he knew that the man 
in Cell 13 didn't have any half-dollars - he  

421
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,320
couldn't have any half-dollars. Just as 
he couldn't have pen and ink and linen.  

422
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,520
But he did have them. It was a fact, not a theory. 
And that is why the warden looked so tired.

423
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:46,240
Then there was the voice that Ballard had heard. 
The word acid. It didn't mean anything, of course.  

424
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,120
Ballard was obviously mad. But 
there were so many things that  

425
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,640
"didn't mean anything" now that The 
Thinking Machine was in the prison.

426
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,840
On the sixth day, the warden received 
a letter from Dr Ransome. It said:
 
 

427
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,240
Dear Sir.

428
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,040
Mr Fielding and I will meet you 
in your office tomorrow evening.  

429
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,280
If Professor Van Dasen has not escaped - and we  

430
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,880
believe he has not because we have not received 
a letter from him - we will meet him there too.

431
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,360
Yours, Dr Ransome.
 
 

432
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,240
That day The Thinking Machine had 
three more messages for the warden.  

433
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:34,560
They were written on the same linen and referred 
to the meeting with Dr Ransome and Mr Fielding.

434
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,560
On the afternoon of the seventh day the 
warden passed Cell 13 and looked in.  

435
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:48,000
The Thinking Machine was sleeping on his bed. 
Everything in the cell was completely normal.  

436
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,720
"He cannot escape between now and half-past 
eight this evening," the warden thought.

437
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:00,080
That evening after six o'clock he saw the guard. 
"Is everything all right in Cell 13?" he asked.  

438
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:08,320
"Yes sir," replied the guard. "But he didn't 
eat much today." The warden was feeling happy  

439
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,840
when he met Dr Ransome and Mr Fielding that 
evening, at seven o'clock. He wanted to show  

440
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:19,680
them The Thinking Machine's messages. He wanted 
to tell them about the events of the week. But  

441
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,960
before he could speak, the guard from the river 
side of the prison yard came into the office.

442
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,200
"The light on my side of the yard is broken," 
the guard said. Oh no. Another problem,"  

443
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,920
said the warden. The guard 
returned to his post in the dark.  

444
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,120
The warden called the electric light company.

445
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:47,600
"Hello. This is Chisholm Prison," he said 
into the phone. "One of our lights is broken.

446
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:54,880
Could you send four men here to repair it? Thank 
you. Goodbye." The warden went out into the yard.  

447
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:01,200
While Dr Ransome and Mr Fielding were waiting, the 
guard from the prison gate came into the office.  

448
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,200
In his hand was a letter. Dr 
Ransome looked at the letter.

449
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,520
"Incredible!" he said. "What is it?" asked 
Mr Fielding. The doctor gave him the letter.  

450
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,560
Fielding looked at it. "It's a coincidence. It 
must be," he said. It was almost eight o'clock  

451
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,240
when the warden returned to his office.

452
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,600
"The electricians have arrived," he said. 
"They are working on the light now."

453
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,560
The warden telephoned the guard at the prison 
gate. "How many electricians came in?" he asked.  

454
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,520
"Four," was the reply.

455
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,640
"All right. You must be certain that 
only four men go out of the prison,"  

456
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,320
said the warden. He put down 
the phone and took the letter.

457
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,520
"My God! It's not possible," he said, shocked.

458
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,960
"What is it?" asked Mr Fielding.

459
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,960
"It's a letter from Cell 13," said 
the warden. "An invitation to dinner!"

460
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,680
"What?" said Ransome.

461
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,120
The three men were silent for a long 
time. Finally the warden called a guard.

462
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,880
"Go down to Cell 13 immediately," he said, 
"and see if the Professor is still there."

463
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,240
The guard ran down the corridor. Dr Ransome 
and Mr Fielding examined the letter.

464
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,600
"It's Van Dusen's handwriting; 
there's no doubt about that,"  

465
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,720
said Dr Ransome. "I've seen too much of it."

466
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,160
At that moment the telephone rang again.  

467
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,600
It was the guard at the prison gate. 
There were two newspaper reporters  

468
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,920
and they wanted to see the warden. The 
warden told the guard to let them come in.

469
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,520
"It's impossible," he said. "Professor 
Van Dusen must be in Cell 13."

470
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,360
Then the guard returned.

471
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,240
"He's still in his cell, sir," he 
said. "I saw him. He's sleeping."

472
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:04,000
"There. I told you." said the warden. "But if he 
is still in his cell how did he send the letter?"

473
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,240
There was a knock at the door.

474
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,360
"It's the reporters," said the warden. "Come in."

475
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,400
The door opened and the two men entered.

476
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:24,720
"Good evening, gentlemen," said one. It was 
Hutchinson Hatch. The warden knew him well.

477
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,640
Then the second man came in.

478
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,160
"Well, I'm here," he said. 
It was The Thinking Machine.

479
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,080
The warden sat with his 
mouth open. He was paralyzed.

480
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:43,600
"How - how - how did you do 
it?" asked the warden, finally.

481
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,520
"Let's go back to the cell," 
said The Thinking Machine.

482
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,000
The men walked down the 
corridor to the door of Cell 13.

483
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,240
"Look inside," said The Thinking Machine.

484
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,680
The warden looked inside. Everything 
looked normal and there - there on  

485
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,080
the bed was the figure of The Thinking 
Machine. Certainly! There was his yellow  

486
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:10,080
hair! The warden looked again at the man 
beside him. "I must be mad," he thought.

487
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,320
Then he unlocked the cell door and 
The Thinking Machine went inside.

488
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,240
"Look here," he said.

489
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,040
He put his foot on the steel bars at the bottom 
of the cell door and three of them fell out.

490
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,240
"And here, too," The Thinking 
Machine stood on his bed  

491
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,560
and put his hand to the bars on 
the window. All of them came out.

492
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,640
"So what's this in the bed?" asked the warden.

493
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,720
"It's a wig," The Thinking Machine 
replied. "Take the cover off."

494
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:54,880
The warden did this. Under it was a coil of 
strong rope about ten metres long, a knife,  

495
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:02,320
three files, three metres of electric wire, 
a pair of steel pliers, a hammer and a pistol

496
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:07,760
"How did you do it?" asked the warden. "You 
gentlemen have an invitation to dinner with  

497
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,560
me at half-past nine," said The Thinking 
Machine. "Come on, or we shall be late."

498
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,320
"But how did you do it?" the warden insisted.

499
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,000
"You cannot hold a man in 
prison who can use his brain,"  

500
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,120
replied The Thinking Machine. 
"Come on, or we shall be late."
 
 

501
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,840
CHAPTER SIX

502
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,680
How Did He Do It?

503
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,360
When dinner was finished The Thinking 
Machine turned to Dr Ransome.

504
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,800
"Well, do you believe me now?" he asked.

505
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,640
"Yes I do," replied Dr Ransome.

506
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,520
There was a long silence. Like all the other 
guests, Ransome was waiting for the explanation.

507
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,320
"So, tell us how you did 
it," said Fielding, finally.

508
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,200
The Thinking Machine began the story.

509
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,760
"The agreement was to go into 
a cell in Chisholm Prison  

510
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,240
with nothing but the necessary clothes 
and to leave that cell within seven days.  

511
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,520
I didn't know Chisholm Prison. When I went into 
the cell I asked for three things: toothpaste, two  

512
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,320
ten-dollar bills and one five-dollar bill and to 
have my shoes blacked. You agreed to these things.

513
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,680
"I knew that there was nothing useful 
in the cell, so I had to use these three  

514
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,280
innocent things to help me escape. But anything 
is dangerous in the hands of a man like me.

515
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,800
"The first night I did two things. I slept 
and I ran after rats. You gentlemen thought  

516
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,360
I wanted time to organize an escape 
with assistance from outside the prison.  

517
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,960
But this was not true. I knew I could 
communicate with anyone I wanted to at any time."

518
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,080
The warden looked at him for a moment. 
The Thinking Machine continued.

519
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,160
"The guard woke me up at six o'clock the next 
morning. He brought me my breakfast. He told  

520
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:08,000
me lunch was at twelve o'clock and dinner 
was at six. I knew that between these times  

521
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,920
I was alone. So after breakfast I examined 
the outside area from my cell window.  

522
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,000
I saw that it was impossible to get over the 
wall. But I knew that on the other side of the  

523
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,040
wall there was a river and also a playground. The 
guard confirmed it. So I knew one important thing.  

524
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,440
A person could come near the prison on that side 
without attracting the attention of the guards.

525
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,680
"But there was something 
even more important. I saw  

526
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,400
a wire which went to the light on the prison roof.  

527
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:47,600
It was very near my cell window. I knew then that 
if it was necessary I could cut off that light.

528
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,360
"Then I thought about escaping 
through the prison building.  

529
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,840
I remembered the way to my cell. 
I knew that was the only way out.  

530
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,960
There were seven doors between my cell 
and the outside. It was too difficult."

531
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,800
The Thinking Machine stopped for a 
moment. Dr Ransome lit a new cigar.  

532
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,160
For several minutes there was silence. 
Then The Thinking Machine continued.

533
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:19,520
"When I was thinking about these things a rat 
ran across my foot. It gave me a new idea. I  

534
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,520
saw there were at least six rats in the cell. But 
they didn't come from under the door. I ran after  

535
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,840
them and they disappeared. But they didn't go out 
of the door. So I knew there was another way out.

536
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:38,400
"I looked for this other way and found it. It was 
a hole in the floor. It went to an old drainpipe.  

537
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,440
Obviously the rats came this way. But where did 
they come from? Drainpipes normally go outside  

538
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:52,160
the prison. This one probably went to the river 
or near it. So the rats came from that direction.

539
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,960
"When the guard came with my lunch he told me 
two important things. One was that there was a  

540
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,960
new plumbing system in the prison. The other was 
that the river was only a hundred metres away.  

541
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:12,000
So I knew that the pipe in my cell was part of 
an old system. And I knew it went to the river.  

542
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,160
The other end of the pipe 
was outside the prison walls.

543
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,440
"But before I could start work, I 
knew I had to distract the warden.  

544
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,480
I wanted him to think that I was trying to 
communicate with you, Dr Ransome. So I took  

545
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,320
two pieces of linen from my shirt and wrote a 
message on them. Do you have the message, warden?"

546
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,360
"Yes." The warden looked at the codec 
message. "But what does it mean?" he asked.  

547
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,960
"Read it from right to left, beginning 
with the T" said The Thinking Machine.  

548
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,040
"Don't consider the division into words."

549
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,920
The warden read the message.

550
00:46:49,440 --> 00:47:00,800
"T-h-i-s," he began, "is not the way I 
intend to escape." The warden smiled.  

551
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,720
"But what did you write it with?"

552
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,840
"This," said The Thinking Machine. 
He put his foot on the table.  

553
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,800
On it was the shoe that he wore in 
prison. But the polish was gone.

554
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,000
"The shoe polish, mixed with some water,  

555
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,840
was my ink," said The Thinking Machine, "and 
the metal end of the shoe lace was a good pen."

556
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,520
The warden laughed. "Continue," he said.

557
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,760
"After the message the warden wanted to search 
my cell. This was good. I wanted him to search  

558
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,280
my cell very often. I thought, 'He won't find 
anything so he will stop and leave me alone.'

559
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,440
"The warden took my shirt away 
and gave me a prison shirt.

560
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,960
Without my white shirt I 
couldn't write any more messages.  

561
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,760
But I had another piece of 
the same shirt in my mouth."

562
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,000
"Where did it come from?" asked 
the warden. "I saw that there  

563
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,600
were only two pieces cut from the 
shirt. And I had both of them."

564
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,280
"You forget that shirts like mine have three 
layers of linen," The Thinking Machine replied.  

565
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,840
"I took out the inside one. You didn't notice it.

566
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:13,440
"Now that the warden was busy, I started to work 
on my real escape plan. I knew that the pipe  

567
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:20,160
from my cell went to the playground outside the 
prison. It is a place where boys play baseball.  

568
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,440
I knew many of the boys there. I knew that 
the rats came into my cell from out there.  

569
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,600
Perhaps it was possible for me to communicate 
with someone outside. I could use the rats.

570
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,600
"The first thing I needed was a long 
thread. So I used the thread from my socks."  

571
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:44,400
He pulled up his trouser-legs. The strong thread 
at the top of his long socks was not there.

572
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:51,760
"Then on one half of my last piece of linen I 
wrote a message for Hutchinson Hatch. He is a  

573
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,840
friend and often helps me. I knew he would help me 
this time. It was a great story for his newspaper.  

574
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,200
I tied a ten-dollar bill to the letter 
to attract attention. People always find  

575
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,720
money. I wrote on the linen: 'If you find 
this message give it to Hutchinson Hatch.  

576
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,520
He will give you another ten dollars for the 
information.' Then I wrote instructions for Hatch.

577
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,440
"I had to get this note outside the prison. 
There were two ways but the best way  

578
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:25,360
was the rats. I took one of them. I tied 
the linen and the money to one of its legs  

579
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,560
and tied my thread to another. 
Then I put it in the pipe.

580
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,800
"From the moment the rat disappeared into that 
dirty pipe I was nervous. The thread could break.  

581
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:41,840
Anything could happen. I waited. I was holding the 
thread and I saw that it became gradually shorter.  

582
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,160
Finally there was only about 
one metre of thread in my hand.  

583
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,960
I knew that the rat was outside the prison. 
But would Hatch receive the message?

584
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,200
"I had to wait. I decided to try some other 
man oeuvres. This was to confuse the warden  

585
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,800
more. I tried to bribe the guard. I tried to 
cut through the bars on my cell window. The  

586
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:09,040
warden became very angry. He took the bars in his 
hands to see if they were solid. They were - then.

587
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,440
"That night I didn't sleep. The thread was 
tied to my hand. I waited for the signal from  

588
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:21,680
outside. I thought. 'If Hatch has received 
the message, and if he finds the drainpipe,  

589
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:27,520
he will pull the thread.' At half-past three in 
the morning I felt something pull the thread."

590
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,440
The Thinking Machine turned to Hutchinson Hatch.

591
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,720
"Now you can explain what you did," he said.

592
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,440
"A small boy brought the linen message to me. 
I gave the boy another ten dollars. I got some  

593
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,280
string and then some wire. I went with the boy 
to the playground. I looked for the end of the  

594
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:54,640
drainpipe for an hour. Then finally I found it. It 
was about thirty centimeters in diameter. I took  

595
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:02,080
the end of the thread and pulled it three times. 
The Professor pulled twice to reply. Quickly I  

596
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:08,640
tied my string to the Professor's thread. Then I 
tied the wire to the string. Professor Van Dusen  

597
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:15,360
began to pull it all into his cell. The wire was 
the most important because it could not break. The  

598
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:22,240
thread was too weak. It could break easily. With 
the wire I could transport things to the cell."

599
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:28,000
"Yes," continued The Thinking Machine. "I was 
very happy when the wire arrived in the cell.  

600
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,400
Then we tried another experiment. I 
spoke to Mr Hatch through the pipe.  

601
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:38,960
He heard me but it was not easy for him to 
understand me. I wanted some nitric- acid and  

602
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,880
I had to repeat the word 'acid' several times. 
Then I heard a scream from the cell above me.

603
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,440
"With the wire it was easy to 
transport things to my cell.  

604
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:55,120
And it was also easy to hide them. I could 
put them into the pipe. You, Mr Warden,  

605
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:01,360
found the pipe but you could not find the wire. 
Your hands are too big. My fingers are longer  

606
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:08,000
and thinner so it was easy for me. In addition I 
put a dead rat in the pipe. You pulled it out."

607
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
"I remember," said the warden.

608
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,960
"The rat was there to stop you investigating 
the pipe," said The Thinking Machine.

609
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,480
"That night Mr Hatch could not send 
me anything useful. But he did send  

610
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,760
me change for ten dollars as a test. The 
next clay I continued to work on my plan.

611
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:33,280
"For this it was necessary that the guard outside 
saw me often at my cell window. To attract his  

612
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,520
attention I threw messages to him. I stood at my 
cell window for hours. Sometimes I spoke to him.  

613
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,280
He told me that there were no 
electricians inside the prison.  

614
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,600
If there was a problem with the lights 
they had to call the light company.

615
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,520
"This was perfect for my escape plan. There 
was only one more thing to do before I escaped.  

616
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,840
Once again I spoke to Mr Hatch through the pipe. 
It was the fourth night of my incarceration.  

617
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,680
Again Mr Hatch could not understand me. 
Again I repeated the word 'acid' three times.  

618
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:11,040
It was this that made the prisoner above 
me confess to murder. The guard told me the  

619
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,320
next day. The prisoner heard strange voices 
through the pipe. He thought it was a ghost.

620
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,560
"With nitric acid it was very easy to cut 
the bars of the window. But it was a long  

621
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:28,560
process. The outside guard saw me standing at 
my window. He didn't know what I was doing.  

622
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,440
As he watched me I cut the bars with 
a piece of wire covered with acid.  

623
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:39,280
On the night of my escape I used the same acid 
to cut the electric wire that went to the lights.  

624
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,400
The yard outside my window was 
completely dark. It was easy to escape.

625
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:51,760
"I also had a wig from Mr Hatch. It was the same 
color as my hair. Yellow. I put it in the bed with  

626
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,400
some other things that Hatch sent me. When the 
guard passed the door he thought I was sleeping."

627
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,280
"But how did you get outside the 
prison gate," asked the warden.

628
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,880
"It was simple," The Thinking Machine replied. 
"As I said. I cut the wire to the lights before  

629
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,240
the guards turned on the current. When they turned 
on the current, the light on my side of the yard  

630
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:18,880
didn't work. The outside guard went to your office 
to tell you and I escaped through my cell window.  

631
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,840
I stayed in the shadows until the four 
electricians arrived. Mr Hatch was one of them.

632
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,840
"When I saw him he gave me some 
workman's clothes to put on.  

633
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:35,200
You, Mr Warden, were standing only three metres 
away. Then Mr Hatch called me - as a workman - and  

634
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,240
together we went out of the gate to get something 
from the van. The guard at the gate knew that  

635
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:45,600
there were four workers in the yard. He saw that 
we were workers so he let us go out of the prison.  

636
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,840
Then we changed clothes and came back in. We went 
to your office and asked to see you. That's all."

637
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,400
"And the letter of invitation?" asked Ransome.

638
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,600
"I wrote it in my cell with Mr Hatch's pen,"  

639
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,840
said The Thinking Machine. "Then I sent it 
through the pipe and Mr Hatch posted it."

640
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,280
There was silence for several minutes. 
Dr Ransome was the first to speak.

641
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,960
"Incredible!" he said. "Absolutely brilliant!"

642
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,840
But Mr Fielding had two more questions.

643
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,600
"And what was the toothpaste for?" he asked.

644
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,360
"For brushing my teeth."

645
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,640
"Why did Mr Hatch come with the electricians?"

646
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,520
"His father is the manager of the 
company," said The Thinking Machine.

647
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,240
"But what if there was no Mr 
Hatch outside to help you?"

648
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,320
"Every prisoner has at least one 
friend who will help him if he can."

649
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,600
"What if there was no old drainpipe 
in your cell," asked the warden.

650
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,280
"There were another two ways to 
escape," said The Thinking Machine.

651
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:56,960
Ten minutes later the telephone 
rang. It was for the warden.

652
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:04,640
"Is the light working now?" asked the warden 
through the phone. "Good. The wire was cut  

653
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:13,200
beside Cell 13? Yes I know. What's that? There 
are too many electricians. Two went out of the  

654
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:19,600
prison and there are three still inside. But 
only four men came from the light company."

655
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,120
The warden turned to the others, confused.

656
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,760
"The guard says that he saw four 
electricians come into the prison.  

657
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,800
Two went out again. But there are 
still three men inside," he said.

658
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,680
"Don't you remember? I was the extra 
man," said The Thinking Machine.

659
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,000
"Oh," said the warden.  

660
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:57,840
"I see." He turned back to the phone. "You can 
let the fifth man go. He's all right."
 
 
 
 

661
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,357
- THE END -
