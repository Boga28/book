CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,049
Death to the King

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,390
The news came one Saturday morning from a
young woman who sounded very upset and spoke

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,860
with a strong foreign accent.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,140
"Yes, hello, police?

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,140
You must come.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,900
He is dead!

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,449
His skin is cold and there is blood all over
the floor.

9
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,939
You must come here as soon as possible, please!"

10
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:31,269
Detective Inspector Evans had just arrived
at the office and was listening to a recording

11
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:33,809
of the telephone call.

12
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,829
There was always a lot of crime in London
on a Friday night, but he was not prepared

13
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,989
for what he was about to hear.

14
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:46,940
The operator was very calm and asked for the
woman's name and location.

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,309
She was calling from a mobile phone.

16
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:52,120
"My name is Helena Kowalska.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,940
I have just come to work...

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,550
I am the cleaner at a nightclub called 'Lust'
in Charing Cross.

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,860
I am sorry, but my English is not very good.

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,150
When will you be here?"

21
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,950
"We'll send someone over as soon as we can,
Mrs Kowalska," the operator replied.

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,590
"Please stay where you are and let me take
some more information.

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,750
Do you know who the dead person is?"

24
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,890
"Of course!"

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,030
she exclaimed.

26
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,440
"It is the big boss.

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,380
He has shot himself.

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,990
The gun is still in his hand."

29
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,590
Inspector Evans could not believe his ears.

30
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,229
"The big boss?" he repeated after the recording
had ended.

31
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:36,460
"Does that mean what I think it means?"

32
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,460
Some people were nodding their heads in answer;
others shrugged.

33
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,890
Could Stanley Cooper really be dead?

34
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:52,120
Stanley Cooper was not only the owner of Lust,
but a notorious crime lord who ran a large

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,100
chain of bars and nightclubs in London's West
End.

36
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,430
He also owned a dog track in Walthamstow.

37
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,490
The Metropolitan Police called him the "King
of the Underworld" because they believed that

38
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,340
he and his gangsters were responsible for
much of the violence in the area.

39
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,129
Unfortunately for them, they had no solid
proof.

40
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:19,540
"The call came in less than twenty minutes
ago," said a deep female voice.

41
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,670
"The forensics team are already on their way
to examine the crime scene.

42
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,140
Evans, you should go and join them.

43
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,720
Something tells me that Cooper didn't kill
himself, and if I'm right, this is going to

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,030
be your case."

45
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,930
It was Superintendent Fisher, the officer
in charge of the station.

46
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,459
She was a very powerful woman, and everything
she said sounded like an order.

47
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:48,650
"Yes, ma'am," replied Inspector Evans.

48
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,970
"I'll take Sandra with me, if that's okay.

49
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,340
We've both been working on cases involving
Cooper's gang lately."

50
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:01,640
"That was going to be my next suggestion,
Evans," the superintendent growled.

51
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,020
"I want you to treat this death as suspicious
from the start.

52
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,440
Don't leave any stone unturned when you're
down there."

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,620
"Of course not, ma'am."

54
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,020
"Where is Checchino, anyway?

55
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,590
It's not like her to be late.

56
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,590
Find her and get going!"

57
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,840
"Right away, ma'am," the inspector said and
left the room.

58
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,709
Detective Inspector Sandra Checchino was sitting
in the staff kitchen when Inspector Evans

59
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,290
burst into the room.

60
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,230
"Ah, Sandra, there you are!"

61
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,409
She looked up from her large cup of coffee
in surprise.

62
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:38,040
"Oh, it looks like someone had a long night
last night!"

63
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,159
Evans said in a friendly tone.

64
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,069
Inspector Checchino smiled weakly.

65
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:44,939
"Yes, you could say that, Gary.

66
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:47,610
I just haven't had time to put on any make-up."

67
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,480
"Never mind, you look no worse without it,"
he joked.

68
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,200
"Anyway, you've just missed some important
news.

69
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,700
You'll never believe what happened last night!"

70
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,200
Inspector Checchino waited for him to continue.

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,280
"We've got to go and see our friend Stanley
Cooper!" he said.

72
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,140
"Oh, no, not again!"

73
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,870
she groaned and looked back down at her coffee.

74
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,159
"That man never cooperates.

75
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,320
He won't tell us anything.

76
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,470
What have he and his thugs done this time?"

77
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,509
"That's what we have to find out," DI Evans
replied mysteriously.

78
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:30,890
"But you are right about one thing: Cooper
definitely won't be telling us anything today,

79
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,440
that's for sure.

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,350
He's been found dead in his office at Lust.

81
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,910
It looks like suicide."

82
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,830
Inspector Checchino opened her eyes wide.

83
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,540
"Mamma mia!" she said in a parody of her Italian
relatives.

84
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,330
"Stanley Cooper's dead?

85
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,729
We should get going right away."

86
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:56,680
She quickly drank what was left of her coffee,
which was still rather hot, and walked out

87
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,600
of the kitchen with Inspector Evans.

88
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,100
The nightclub looked like a small building
from the outside.

89
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,120
The entrance was between two bars on a narrow
side street of Charing Cross Road.

90
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,730
Large, colourful posters on the door advertised
which disc jockeys were playing on which nights,

91
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:22,750
and red neon lights above the door spelt out
in elaborate letters the word "Lust".

92
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:28,389
"This would be a nice place for a first date,"
Inspector Evans said, smiling at Inspector

93
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:29,680
Checchino.

94
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,690
"Look, we missed DJs Mad Daddy and Divine
Lickz last night!"

95
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,730
"You and your jokes," she replied flatly.

96
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,220
"I think we're both a bit too old for places
like these, don't you?"

97
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,710
"I certainly am, but you're still young, free
and single, Sandra.

98
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,900
You'd quickly find yourself a date in a place
like this."

99
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,210
"Don't make me laugh.

100
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,639
I'm thirty-five next month.

101
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,139
And we meet enough thugs at work - I don't
want to date one as well."

102
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,430
"Lust is very exclusive," said Inspector Evans.

103
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,310
"Well, it is if you compare it to Cooper's
other bars, at least..."

104
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,970
The uniformed policeman who was guarding the
entrance smiled and let the pair inside.

105
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,970
They walked down the stairs, past the cloakroom
and into the bar area.

106
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,760
The air was heavy with the smell of alcohol,
and the floor was littered with empty bottles

107
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,560
and cigarette stubs.

108
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,789
It was quite sticky underfoot.

109
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:32,910
The large, pink leather sofas against the
walls looked very out of place in the daylight

110
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,590
that shone through the tall windows.

111
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,449
"Nice decor," Inspector Checchino whispered
sarcastically.

112
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:47,740
A young woman wearing jeans and a jumper was
sitting on one of the silver and red bar stools.

113
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,729
She did not notice the two police officers
entering the room, because she was busy talking

114
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:55,840
on her mobile phone in a loud voice.

115
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,760
"That must be the cleaner," said Inspector
Evans, who spoke a few words of Polish.

116
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,370
"We'll talk to her later.

117
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,020
Come on, let's go and see our man."

118
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,510
Although she was an experienced investigator,
Inspector Checchino always felt a sense of

119
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:17,120
dread before seeing dead bodies, and today
was no exception.

120
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Her colleague, on the other hand, seemed to
be nothing but happy about Stanley Cooper's

121
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
death.

122
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,099
The forensics team were busy taking photographs
when Inspectors Evans and Checchino entered

123
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,710
the office.

124
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,900
"It's really true, then, the King has snuffed
it?"

125
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,110
Inspector Evans asked.

126
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,530
Near the back of the office, a man's head
appeared from behind the desk and grinned.

127
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,639
"A single shot to the brain," he said as he
stood up.

128
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,139
It was Vash Singh, one of the forensics experts.

129
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,050
His thick glasses made his eyes look as large
as saucers.

130
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,379
"There's no sign of a struggle at all," he
said.

131
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:59,159
"Just look around this room; you can see for
yourselves how tidy it is."

132
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,789
The office looked completely normal - apart
from the two legs that were sticking out from

133
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:06,190
behind the desk.

134
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,350
Inspector Evans walked up to look at the rest
of the body.

135
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:16,349
"Hmm, it's certainly less tidy at this end
of the room, that's for sure," he said solemnly.

136
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:20,220
Stanley Cooper's body was lying face up in
a pool of blood.

137
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,110
His mouth was open, and his arms were resting
on either side of his fat chest.

138
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,460
The inspector's eyes moved directly to the
gun in the man's left hand.

139
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,789
"So, what do you think, Vash?

140
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,100
Is it really possible that he shot himself?"

141
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,219
"I'd say so, Gary," he replied.

142
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:43,839
"It does look like suicide, but we still can't
rule out murder.

143
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,710
There'll have to be a full ballistic analysis.

144
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,080
We can only guess the facts until then."

145
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,820
"Does it look like the body's been moved at
all?"

146
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,080
Vash shook his head.

147
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,290
"There's a lot of blood here, but it's all
in one place," he said.

148
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,500
Inspector Checchino walked over from the doorway
and looked at the body.

149
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,310
The dead man had short, grey hair and a big
moustache that sat above his top lip like

150
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,930
a lazy caterpillar.

151
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:16,300
Even dead, he still has the same arrogant
expression on his face, she thought.

152
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,070
"Do you have any idea when this happened?"

153
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,270
she asked.

154
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,910
Vash pushed his glasses up his nose and explained
that the body had already been a little stiff

155
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,930
when they had arrived just after ten o'clock.

156
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,649
They had also measured the temperature.

157
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:35,540
"I'd say he died between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m.,"
he concluded.

158
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,610
"And you've found nothing unusual at all?"

159
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,610
she continued.

160
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,810
Vash shrugged.

161
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,810
"I wouldn't expect his arms to be in that
position if he shot himself," he said, "but

162
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,930
on the other hand, it's not impossible."

163
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:53,050
"Well, you've been trying to bring this man
to justice for a long time, Sandra," said

164
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,329
Inspector Evans.

165
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:59,209
"It looks to me like someone may have helped
you out."

166
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:04,230
"Maybe," she said quietly, staring at the
dead man's arms.

167
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,890
Then one of the other forensics experts said
that there was something interesting about

168
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:14,750
Cooper's shirt: she had noticed a small amount
of lipstick on the collar when she was taking

169
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,779
photographs of the body.

170
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:22,180
Inspector Checchino was examining a computer
monitor in the corner of the office.

171
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,780
It showed sixteen small pictures of the main
rooms in the nightclub from different angles,

172
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,269
including the office they were standing in.

173
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:33,589
It also showed two more pictures of the street
outside.

174
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:38,550
"There should be a lot of evidence on this,
Gary," she said, pointing at the security

175
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,800
camera footage.

176
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,279
Inspector Evans looked at the screen and scratched
his head.

177
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,829
"Hmm," he replied slowly.

178
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:51,350
"There might have been if someone hadn't switched
it off.

179
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:57,360
Look, it's not recording."

180
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,470
CHAPTER TWO

181
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,470
Find the Woman

182
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,810
"Sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs Kowalska,"
Inspector Evans began.

183
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,950
"Could you begin by telling us what the nightclub
was like when you came to work this morning?"

184
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,910
"Everything looked normal," she replied, looking
him in the eye.

185
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,770
"The doors were locked, and the lights were
off.

186
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,770
The sign outside was still turned on, but
that happens quite often."

187
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,889
"Is there an alarm system fitted here?" he
asked.

188
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:29,740
Inspector Checchino was noting down the information
and looked up at the cleaner when she did

189
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,100
not reply.

190
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,670
"Do you have an alarm?"

191
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,670
Evans repeated.

192
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,670
"Yes.

193
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,260
Sorry, I do not understand everything you
say," Helena said.

194
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,740
"The alarm was turned off when I arrived.

195
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,600
I thought that the big boss was here, or the
manager.

196
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,480
They sometimes stay in the office and play
poker until the morning."

197
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,240
"I see.

198
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,930
Can you tell me the manager's name, please?"

199
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,300
"Omar Omari," the cleaner smiled.

200
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,660
"He is such a charming man, Inspector.

201
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,920
He is always very friendly to me."

202
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,000
"How many other people work here at the club?"

203
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,450
"I'm not sure.

204
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,790
I do not know most of them personally," Helena
replied slowly.

205
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,410
"There is a list of names and telephone numbers
on the notice board.

206
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,589
I can give you a copy."

207
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:21,290
"That would be very helpful, thank you," he
said.

208
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,240
"It would also help us a great deal if you
could answer a few more questions."

209
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,589
The cleaner sighed a little and looked at
her watch.

210
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:32,279
"I must do some work," she complained.

211
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,880
"I have two more places to go to this morning."

212
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,279
"I'll try to be brief, Mrs Kowalska.

213
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,930
Have you heard of any arguments involving
Stanley Cooper recently?"

214
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,839
The young lady shook her head.

215
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:49,300
"I do not see the big boss often.

216
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,480
And when I do, he does not tell me anything
like that."

217
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,899
"I see, but maybe you've heard other people
talking about him?"

218
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,720
"You should talk to Omar," she replied.

219
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,500
"He knows much more about his private life.

220
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,090
In fact, he sometimes complains that he is
too - hmm, what is the word?

221
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,730
- too involved in it."

222
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,320
Inspector Evans paused and looked across at
his colleague.

223
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,960
"I didn't necessarily mean his private life,
Mrs Kowalska.

224
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,720
Do you know anything about any business deals,
for example?

225
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,610
Or have you heard any rumours involving other
gangs?"

226
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,910
"Gangs?"

227
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,060
she repeated, shocked.

228
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060
"Oh no!

229
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,949
I am sorry, I really have nothing to do with
any of that.

230
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:39,180
I'm just the cleaner here."

231
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,870
The police had been knocking for five minutes
when Omar Omari finally opened the front door

232
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,470
to his apartment in North London.

233
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:52,769
His wild, curly hair was hanging over his
eyes, and he was only half dressed.

234
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:57,899
He did not seem at all surprised by the news
of his boss's death.

235
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:03,751
"So the dirty old swine is dead?" he laughed.

236
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:05,089
"He had that coming."

237
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:10,060
"Please take this seriously, Mr Omari," Inspector
Checchino said sternly.

238
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,730
"We're talking about a man's life - and possibly
a very serious crime."

239
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,640
"What do you mean by 'possibly'?" he asked.

240
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,130
"We're still trying to find out exactly what
happened last night," she said calmly.

241
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,709
"May we come inside?"

242
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,640
"Why, of course.

243
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,209
Do come on in, Officers," the man said with
exaggerated politeness.

244
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:34,730
"Take a seat in the lounge and I'll be right
with you."

245
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:42,180
The pair sat down on an old, blue futon that
was covered in large stains.

246
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,540
Omar came back a minute later wearing a white
T-shirt.

247
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,350
He was also carrying a rolled-up pair of socks
which he put on as the police began their

248
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,350
interview.

249
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,800
"Could you begin by telling us when you left
work last night, Mr Omari?"

250
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,730
Inspector Checchino asked in a tolerant voice.

251
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,170
"Yes, it was a really busy night and I stayed
until the end.

252
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,570
We had some great DJs playing - Mad Daddy
was there, you know - so it was an important

253
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,860
event for us all.

254
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,579
It went really well."

255
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:17,520
He brushed his hair away from his eyes and
looked at the two inspectors, who both seemed

256
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,839
to be expecting him to say more.

257
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,300
"Oh, I was there until about 4:30, I suppose,"
he finally answered.

258
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,650
Inspector Checchino wrote down the information.

259
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,050
"Did anybody see you leave?"

260
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,050
she asked.

261
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,810
"At that time in the morning?

262
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,860
No.

263
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,370
At least, nobody I know.

264
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,660
I got the night bus back up here."

265
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,029
"Hmm.

266
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:47,490
Well, what can you tell us about Stanley Cooper
- was he alone when you left the club?"

267
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,649
"No.

268
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:54,620
A man called Bruno Tartufo was in the office
with him all night," he explained.

269
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,589
"He's the boss's right-hand man.

270
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,019
They're almost always together, and he was
still there when I left."

271
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:08,709
"And apart from yourself, Mr Omari, how many
people have access to Mr Cooper's office?"

272
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:11,149
Inspector Checchino asked.

273
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:13,160
Omar did not flinch.

274
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,509
"I only go in there when I'm invited.

275
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:21,139
Normally I work in my own office across the
hall, but I know some people who don't have

276
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:24,450
to wait for an invitation, if you know what
I mean."

277
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:29,470
The young man grinned at the two inspectors
with perfect white teeth.

278
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,540
They looked back at him expressionlessly,
not understanding what was so amusing.

279
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,670
"Well, it's what they always say at the start
of a police investigation, isn't it?

280
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,440
Cherchez la femme!

281
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,480
And I can tell you right away that Cooper
had a young lady friend: a Miss Kim Watt.

282
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,589
She had him wrapped around her little finger"

283
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:52,449
"Kim Watt?"

284
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,470
repeated Inspector Checchino.

285
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:00,140
"Yes, Kim Watt the Kumquat, I call her - a
fruity little thing.

286
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,829
She manages Cooper's dog track in Walthamstow.

287
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:06,870
But I've seen her in Lust quite a lot lately,
too.

288
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,230
She always comes to the bar as soon as she
arrives and pours herself a gin and tonic,

289
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,270
the little madam."

290
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,230
"Did you see her at the club last night?"

291
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,230
Omar shook his head and brushed back his hair
again.

292
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:26,160
"Who else would Mr Cooper let into his office?"
asked the inspector, who suddenly felt there

293
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,539
was something strangely attractive about the
club manager.

294
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:32,220
"Just his idiot henchmen, I guess.

295
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,480
They do everything for Cooper, and they have
keys to all of his bars and clubs.

296
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,740
Faithful as dogs, they are - and just as stupid."

297
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,590
Inspector Evans laughed a little and took
down the men's names.

298
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:52,611
"Now then," he continued, "has anything happened
lately that could have made Stanley Cooper

299
00:17:52,611 --> 00:17:54,760
someone's enemy?"

300
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,090
"Lots!"

301
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,169
Omar exclaimed.

302
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:00,990
"And you're asking the right person, let me
tell you!

303
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,450
He tried to get me involved in some of his
'business activities' outside the nightclub,

304
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,330
but I didn't want to have anything to do with
it."

305
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:16,540
"Is that what Helena Kowalska meant when she
said that you knew about his private life?"

306
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,850
Inspector Checchino wondered aloud.

307
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:25,190
"Ah, Helena," sighed Omar, "She doesn't know
the half of it.

308
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,120
But yes, I've told her some things in private.

309
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,170
The boss wanted me to 'take a message to a
client' in Walthamstow.

310
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,260
I'm not paid to go on dangerous missions like
that, though!"

311
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:43,150
"One last thing, Mr Omari," said Inspector
Evans towards the end of the interview.

312
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,600
"Do you know how to operate the security camera
system at Lust?"

313
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,400
"Of course," he replied.

314
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,980
"I'm the manager there, aren't I?

315
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,730
Actually, I don't have to do very much at
all.

316
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,260
It runs automatically, you see.

317
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,549
The cameras are connected to a computer that
saves the videos for a month, and then they're

318
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,549
deleted."

319
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:09,110
"Someone stopped the computer from recording
last night," the inspector explained.

320
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,140
"Have you any idea who that might have been?"

321
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,090
Omar blinked at him.

322
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,090
"No.

323
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,360
But it seems like a sensible thing to do if
you're going to commit a crime, doesn't it?"

324
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,870
he said dryly.

325
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,530
"Is it possible that there's another copy
of the videos somewhere?"

326
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,830
Inspector Evans continued.

327
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:35,120
"For example, is the footage sent to another
company, or to Mr Cooper's home computer?"

328
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,590
"Nope," said Omar simply.

329
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,470
"His house is the one place that is totally
secure.

330
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,809
Bad Manor Park.

331
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:46,130
I've heard that it's like Fort Knox there!"

332
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,340
"Bruno Tartufo!"

333
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,450
repeated Inspector Evans after they left the
apartment.

334
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,299
"This isn't the first time we've heard that
name lately."

335
00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:00,200
The Metropolitan Police were trying to fight
the sale of cocaine in and around the West

336
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,240
End, and several unimportant members of a
drugs ring had mentioned Tartufo.

337
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,120
"Another fine Italian citizen in the city
of London," said Inspector Checchino ironically.

338
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,510
"We're not related, before you say anything."

339
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:20,510
Inspector Evans was more interested in finding
Tartufo than making jokes.

340
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,770
He radioed the station.

341
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,280
"I need addresses for Bruno Tartufo and Kim
Watt," he said.

342
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,820
"And make sure that the family liaison officer
reaches Stanley Cooper's daughter before the

343
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,780
Polish cleaner starts to gossip!"

344
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,360
Later that day, towards the midafternoon,
the two detectives drove to an elegant town

345
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,200
house in Chelsea.

346
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,610
It was the address of the third and last Kim
Watt in central London.

347
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:51,679
The first two had said that they did not know
anything about anyone called Stanley Cooper,

348
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:59,110
The pair had also tried to speak to Bruno
Tartufo, but there was nobody home, Inspector

349
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:04,210
Evans walked up the three white marble steps
leading to the large, black front door, rang

350
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,510
the bell and waited.

351
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,370
The voice that eventually came through the
intercom was as sweet as honey.

352
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:18,039
"Hello?" she asked, her voice almost seductive,
"Who's there?"

353
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:25,090
"Police, ma'am," replied the inspector with
a small smile, "Please open up!"

354
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:29,039
The first thing the police saw on the other
side of the door was a tall redhead with a

355
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,440
surprised expression on her face.

356
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,340
Her lips were painted bright red, Moments
later; a short man with a thin moustache entered

357
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,059
the hallway and stood next to her.

358
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:45,210
He looked at the police and put his arm around
the woman, "Miss Watt?"

359
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,340
Inspector Evans began, "Yes?"

360
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,690
"We've come to talk to you about Stanley Cooper,
May we come inside for a moment?"

361
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,730
"Hah!

362
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,279
You've caught him at last, have you?"

363
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,590
joked the small man in an unmistakably Italian
accent.

364
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,570
"Bruno, be quiet!"

365
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,279
Kim hissed,

366
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,740
"Ah, and you must be Mr Tartufo!"

367
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:15,400
the inspector smiled, "We have a lot to discuss."

368
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,110
CHAPTER THREE

369
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,600
A Headless Organization

370
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:25,610
After over an hour of interviews, Inspectors
Evans and Checchino left Kim Watt's house

371
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,659
in Chelsea and set off back to the station.

372
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:31,580
They talked about their impressions on the
way.

373
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:36,929
"I never thought the notorious Bruno Tartufo
would be such a short man!"

374
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:38,659
began Inspector Evans.

375
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:42,470
"Even you're taller than him, Sandra!"

376
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,490
She gave a little laugh, but kept her eyes
fixed on the road.

377
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,100
"Don't be fooled," she said, "small people
can be dangerous."

378
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,220
"I didn't like the way he was staring at Kim
whenever she spoke," her colleague continued.

379
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,410
"He was intimidating her.

380
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,960
Do you think she was telling the truth?"

381
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,040
"People like her are never honest about everything,
Gary," she replied, "but she did take the

382
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,850
news about Cooper very badly."

383
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:13,630
"For a few moments, maybe, then she was perfectly
normal again.

384
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:19,179
I know she says she was at the dog track in
Walthamstow all evening, but that closed just

385
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:22,570
after midnight, and she has no alibi for the
time of the shooting."

386
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,289
"Not many people will have an alibi that they
can prove, Gary.

387
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,150
After all, it was between five and six o'clock
in the morning.

388
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,370
I'm sure that you and I were asleep like most
other people in London, but nobody can prove

389
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,149
that either, can they?"

390
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,330
Inspector Evans turned to his colleague and
grinned.

391
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,780
"Only because you've turned me down so often,
Sandra.

392
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,620
I know better than to ask you out on a Friday
night now."

393
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,650
Inspector Checchino laughed in amusement.

394
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,610
"Oh, come off it!

395
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,309
You're a good friend, but we tried that once,
if you remember.

396
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,510
It would never work."

397
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,780
"I know, I know," he said.

398
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,240
"You can't blame me for trying, though."

399
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,220
There was a short pause in the conversation.

400
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,789
"What about Bruno?" he asked.

401
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:09,600
Inspector Checchino frowned.

402
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,470
"Hmm, yes, what about him?"

403
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,470
she agreed.

404
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,539
"He didn't appear at all shocked by the news.

405
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:23,090
And I find it very suspicious that he says
he left the nightclub at exactly 5 a.m., don't

406
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,090
you?"

407
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,220
The car came to a halt at some red traffic
lights, and she looked Inspector Evans in

408
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,549
the eye.

409
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:34,730
"Moments before Cooper was killed," he agreed,
scratching his chin.

410
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,970
"But Bruno says that his boss was expecting
a visitor and that he wanted to be alone when

411
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,919
that person arrived.

412
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,630
That's why he left the club at that time."

413
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,630
"So he says, yes," sighed Inspector Checchino.

414
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,650
"I don't believe that story for a second.

415
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,390
It's very convenient for Bruno, isn't it?"

416
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,570
Inspector Evans nodded slowly.

417
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,510
"It is, yes.

418
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,950
But it could be convenient for us that we
found him at Kim Watt's house today.

419
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,279
According to Omar, she was going out with
Cooper, wasn't she?

420
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,840
So, what do you think she was doing with Bruno
on a Saturday afternoon?"

421
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,210
Back at the police station, the two detectives
met Superintendent Fisher to discuss their

422
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,299
findings.

423
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:25,070
She listened to everything they had to say,
but she was not interested in the smaller

424
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:31,380
details: her favourite football club Arsenal
was playing at 5:30 p.m., and she was planning

425
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,020
to watch the game from start to finish.

426
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,870
"Let's be realistic," she said.

427
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,679
"Although it's very likely, we still don't
have any solid proof that Cooper didn't kill

428
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,149
himself.

429
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:48,010
And it won't be hard to find a lot of people
who had a good reason to want that man dead.

430
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,610
I'm sure even you two are pleased that he's
gone."

431
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,529
"You're right, ma'am," said Inspector Evans.

432
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:59,250
"And although we've collected some statements
from the people nearest to him today, it will

433
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:04,130
take a few days to compare what they've said
against whatever evidence there is."

434
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,710
"Right," she said.

435
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:11,020
"So let's call it a day and enjoy what's left
of the weekend."

436
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,440
Inspector Checchino remained quiet and followed
Inspector Evans out of the superintendent's

437
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,149
office.

438
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:24,039
On Monday morning, Inspector Checchino arrived
at work a good hour before Inspector Evans.

439
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:28,460
She had not been able to sleep well, and she
wanted to see what developments had taken

440
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,830
place over the weekend.

441
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,179
An incident room had been set up at the station
to collect all the information related to

442
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,700
Stanley Cooper's death.

443
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,529
The inspector was in there reading through
the reports when her colleague finally turned

444
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:42,740
up.

445
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,919
"So, have you heard?"

446
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:47,309
she asked her colleague, her face red with
anger.

447
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:49,210
"Good morning, Sandra!

448
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,260
Nice to see you, too," he said ironically.

449
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,190
"It's not like you to be here before me on
a Monday."

450
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,840
"Sorry.

451
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,649
Good morning, Gary," she smiled.

452
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:00,169
"Well, have you?"

453
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:02,100
"Obviously not.

454
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,820
What have you got for me?"

455
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,659
"To begin with, there was an arson attack
at Lust late last night.

456
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:14,529
The fire brigade think that someone broke
a window and set fire to a can of petrol.

457
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:18,789
You saw all the soft furniture in there: it
went up like a match.

458
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:20,919
The fire's destroyed everything inside."

459
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:21,919
"What?!

460
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,890
How did that happen?

461
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,950
Didn't we have an officer guarding the club
all weekend?"

462
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:33,409
"Only until the club manager locked up after
the forensics team had finished investigating

463
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,450
the scene," Inspector Checchino explained.

464
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,159
"That was on Saturday evening."

465
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,640
"I see," Inspector Evans said.

466
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,679
"And do you have any idea why someone might
want to burn down one of Cooper's clubs?"

467
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,710
"Well, it was too late to destroy the evidence.

468
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,580
My first thought was that Omar Omari might
have had something to do with it, but then

469
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,540
I read these."

470
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,830
She passed Inspector Evans a pile of paper.

471
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:08,190
"Three people in the north of the city have
reported the theft of their greyhounds.

472
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,539
Altogether we have six expensive racing dogs
to find."

473
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:16,110
"Why should we care about some kidnapped dogs?"
he asked.

474
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,549
Then he remembered.

475
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:22,929
"I suppose I don't need to ask what connects
these animals to Stanley Cooper, should I?"

476
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:26,309
"Probably not, no," said Inspector Checchino.

477
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:29,799
"The owners race them at Cooper's track in
Walthamstow.

478
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:34,460
And, as we learnt on Saturday, Kim Watt is
the manager there."

479
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,549
"What do we know about the owners - are they
friends?"

480
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,149
"One of them is Kim's brother.

481
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:44,020
The other two were close friends of Cooper's.

482
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,820
And when I say 'friends', I mean that both
were in his gang."

483
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,299
"Ah.

484
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:55,340
But why would someone target the dogs and
not the people?" asked DI Evans.

485
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:00,799
"Well, for a start, each greyhound is worth
at least 40,000 pound's.

486
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,700
And all six are meant to be racing at an event
tonight, so it will be very bad for business

487
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,630
if they aren't there."

488
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:13,659
"Sorry if I'm being a bit slow," he replied,
"but what do these dogs have to do with the

489
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:15,529
fire at Lust?

490
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:17,960
What's the connection?"

491
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,370
Inspector Checchino took the papers back and
put them on the desk.

492
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,390
"I think it was a symbolic act," she said.

493
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,340
"It's typical for gangs.

494
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:34,169
Just think about it: Lust was Cooper's most
prestigious nightclub, and it's where all

495
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:36,480
the best DJs went to play.

496
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,090
Whoever the killer was, he didn't only want
to kill the king, he wanted to destroy his

497
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,480
palace, too.

498
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,409
Kidnapping the dogs adds insult to injury
for Cooper's gang.

499
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:51,330
If we find the dogs, we will probably find
our killer,"

500
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,919
"You may have a good point there, Sandra.

501
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,080
But I need to wake up properly with a coffee
before looking at this more closely.

502
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,190
Can I get you one, too?"

503
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,970
Nobody knew exactly how many security cameras
there were in the city of London, but there

504
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,809
were a lot.

505
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:14,559
There were cameras on every main road and
in every underground station; they were also

506
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:20,640
installed on every bus to fight vandalism,
terrorism and other crimes.

507
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,100
A team of junior officers were watching the
camera footage from all of the night buses

508
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:30,210
that left Trafalgar Square for Finchley in
North London early on Saturday morning.

509
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,660
It was a boring job, but it was the only way
to find out if Omar Omari was telling the

510
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:41,409
truth: he had told the police that he could
not remember exactly which bus he had taken,

511
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:45,169
but that he normally got on the 134 or the
N13.

512
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:50,490
Meanwhile, Inspectors Evans and Checchino
were reviewing the videos from Lust.

513
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:54,070
There was a lot of footage on the hard disk
from Friday night.

514
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:59,480
Finally, they saw Bruno Tartufo leave the
building just before 5 a.m.

515
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,779
The recording was turned off five minutes
later.

516
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:04,980
"I don't believe it!"

517
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,139
cried Inspector Evans.

518
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:09,890
"He really did leave the club before Cooper
was shot!"

519
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:15,600
"Hmm...," his colleague said quietly, "but
did he return?"

520
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,929
They repeated the last ten minutes of footage
in Cooper's office.

521
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:23,570
It was a strange feeling to watch the monitor.

522
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,950
Inspector Checchino thought it was as if one
of the dead had come back to life and was

523
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,019
walking around the room.

524
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:35,690
The two detectives watched Cooper point to
the door, at which point the short Italian

525
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,220
man turned and left the room.

526
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,690
Cooper then took out his mobile phone and
made a call that lasted only a few seconds.

527
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,519
He was smiling.

528
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,140
After he put his phone back into his pocket,
he waddled up to the computer in the corner,

529
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,570
looked up at the camera, and the screen went
black.

530
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,149
"He turned off the recording himself!"

531
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:58,409
she exclaimed in surprise.

532
00:31:58,409 --> 00:31:59,960
"Why would he do that?"

533
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,769
"I'd say it's fairly obvious that he was about
to do something that he wanted to keep secret,"

534
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:07,799
replied Inspector Evans dryly.

535
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,430
"What do you mean?"

536
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,279
"Well, it could have been anything.

537
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:17,570
A secret business deal, a meeting with an
important drug trafficker... maybe even a

538
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,210
meeting with a mystery lady friend?"

539
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,760
Inspector Checchino laughed.

540
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,120
"A mystery woman?

541
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,190
Do you really think that someone as unattractive
and disgusting as Stanley Cooper could manage

542
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,010
two women?"

543
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:37,929
He was about to reply when one of the junior
officers shouted across the room: "I've found

544
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:38,929
him!"

545
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:44,580
She had identified the bus that Omar Omari
got onto after work on Saturday morning.

546
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,330
The club manager had been correct that it
was the 134 to Finchley, but he had got the

547
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,850
time wrong.

548
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:56,730
According to the clock on the screen, it was
already 5:30 a.m. when he left Trafalgar Square.

549
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,639
"A whole hour later?"

550
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:01,190
Inspector Checchino thought aloud.

551
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:09,570
"A lot can happen in sixty minutes..."

552
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,010
CHAPTER FOUR

553
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,880
A Smoking Gun

554
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,080
Inspector Checchino was more patient than
Inspector Evans.

555
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,010
She told him that it would be a bad idea to
rush to visit Omar Omari again.

556
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:26,160
They should wait until there was some solid
proof that he had returned to the scene, she

557
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
said.

558
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,220
"Why do you and Fisher always talk about waiting?"
he complained.

559
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,419
"We should bring him in for questioning before
he disappears!"

560
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:39,549
In the end, the pair spent most of Monday
interviewing the other people who worked at

561
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:42,940
Lust, but it proved to be pointless.

562
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:48,539
Everyone had gone home before the manager
left, and nobody could remember anything unusual.

563
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:53,440
Two other officers had spoken with the staff
at Cooper's bars and his other clubs.

564
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,360
Most of them had very little to say.

565
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,260
They all respected their boss a great deal,
it seemed - or they were still afraid of him,

566
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,570
even though he was dead.

567
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:12,940
The only noteworthy report came from one of
the women 

568
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,369
seen her boss smoking outside a bar in Soho
at around 3:30 a.m.

569
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:23,430
Kim had forgotten to mention this fact when
the inspectors had visited her in Chelsea.

570
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:28,450
According to her own statement, she had stayed
at work until shortly after 1 a.m. and then

571
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,839
driven back home.

572
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,230
"We should go and speak to her again right
away!"

573
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,300
Inspector Evans said when he heard the report.

574
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:40,349
"You wanted to do the same with Omar Omari
a few hours ago, Gary," sighed Inspector Checchino.

575
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:44,720
"We can't go around accusing everyone of lying
to us."

576
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,330
"Well, one of them is hiding something," he
growled.

577
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,570
"At least one of them."

578
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:54,129
Their conversation was interrupted when the
telephone on Inspector Evans' desk rang.

579
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:57,980
It was Vash Singh calling from the forensics
department.

580
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:04,170
He said that he had some important news for
the investigators.

581
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:08,980
The two detectives always enjoyed talking
to Vash, who could explain things in a lively

582
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,080
and interesting way.

583
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,579
When they walked into his office this time,
Vash was holding a plastic skull in one hand

584
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:17,410
and a pencil in the other.

585
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,200
"You should have been an actor," said Inspector
Evans.

586
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,640
"You'd make a good Hamlet."

587
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,579
"Just take a seat and listen to what I have
to tell you," he smiled.

588
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:31,160
"First of all, we can definitely rule out
suicide now.

589
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,780
Look, the bullet must have gone in at this
angle."

590
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,829
He was pointing the pencil at the left temple,
but it was nowhere near square against the

591
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:40,829
skull.

592
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:45,210
"How can you be sure it was murder?" asked
Inspector Checchino.

593
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:51,280
"Stanley Cooper was left-handed, and the revolver
in his hand was six inches long.

594
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,500
Just look at the trajectory."

595
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,130
Inspector Evans put his hands in the position
that Vash was describing.

596
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,700
"You're right," he agreed.

597
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,670
"I wouldn't try to commit suicide like this.

598
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,630
It's too difficult."

599
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,990
He turned to Inspector Checchino, who was
staring at the skull.

600
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:15,040
"I'd either put the gun inside my mouth or
hold it here, just above my ear, wouldn't

601
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,780
you?"

602
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,619
Inspector Checchino sighed a little.

603
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:24,210
"I haven't really thought about how I would
shoot myself, Gary, but you're both right,

604
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,210
yes."

605
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:30,690
"So," Vash continued, "now you probably think
that someone was standing in front of him,

606
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,349
and not to his side?"

607
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:35,720
Inspectors Evans and Checchino both nodded.

608
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,950
"You're wrong!"

609
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,310
Vash exclaimed.

610
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,390
"Neither Cooper nor the killer were standing
up.

611
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:46,720
We found no traces of blood near head height
in the room, and none on the desk either.

612
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,410
But there is something very revealing about
the few small spots on the back wall of the

613
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,490
office."

614
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,829
He showed the inspectors a photograph of the
bloodstains.

615
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:58,000
"Take a look.

616
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,050
The stains on this picture suggest that Cooper's
head was about two feet above the ground when

617
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,050
he was shot."

618
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,880
"So he was kneeling?"

619
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,079
the inspector asked.

620
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,829
"Someone made him beg for his life?"

621
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:14,840
"No, the blood is too low down for that as
well," Vash explained.

622
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:21,830
"I think he was lying down, which would also
explain the position of the body."

623
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:26,190
Inspector Evans remembered seeing Cooper's
body on the office floor in Lust.

624
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,770
It was true that he did not appear to have
fallen to the ground: both of his arms were

625
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,040
resting on either side of his chest.

626
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,280
"Do you mean the killer was lying on top of
him?" he asked.

627
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,950
"That would explain the lipstick on his shirt
as well, don't you think?"

628
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,319
Vash suggested.

629
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:47,060
"Cherchez la femme!"

630
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,580
The inspectors exchanged looks.

631
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:54,109
"Did anyone ever find Cooper's mobile phone?"
asked Inspector Checchino.

632
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:59,460
"We know that he made a call shortly before
he was shot, but we have no idea whose number

633
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,850
he dialled.

634
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:05,859
We asked his telephone company, and they said
that it belongs to a pay-as-you-go phone that

635
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:08,390
hasn't been registered."

636
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,050
Vash shook his head.

637
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:14,440
"We didn't find anything else in the office
that could help you," he explained.

638
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,090
"Apart from one thing, that is.

639
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:22,040
You haven't asked about the really important
clue that we're quite excited about."

640
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,829
"What's that?"

641
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:27,060
the two inspectors asked simultaneously.

642
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:34,150
"Whoever shot Stanley Cooper wanted it to
look like a suicide, so they left the gun

643
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,619
and the shell casing on the scene.

644
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:41,010
Of course there is no licence for the gun,
but the bullet was quite rare.

645
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:46,599
The ballistics expert says that fewer than
five percent of revolvers use this type.

646
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:50,820
Interestingly, they're more popular in Eastern
Europe.

647
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,810
There's a large factory near Warsaw."

648
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:59,390
"He was killed by a Polish bullet?" asked
Inspector Evans, surprised.

649
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,910
"Not necessarily, no.

650
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:07,830
The same bullets are available in Britain
as well, but they're not used very much."

651
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:13,240
"The cleaner is Polish," the inspector continued,
ignoring what Vash was saying.

652
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,450
"I bet she knows some people in Cooper's gangs,
too.

653
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:22,150
I thought it was strange that someone who
visits a place like Lust so often knew so

654
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,930
little about the people there."

655
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:29,859
Inspector Checchino smiled at Vash and turned
to her colleague with an irritated look.

656
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:32,850
"Will you stop accusing everyone, Gary!"

657
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,850
she complained.

658
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:39,780
"First it was Bruno, then Omar, then Kim,
and now you want to accuse Helena Kowalska!"

659
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,550
"I want to speak to them all again," he replied
stubbornly.

660
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,780
"We should start with the women.

661
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,329
After all, that lipstick on his collar must
have come from somewhere."

662
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:53,690
"But it could have been there for days," Inspector
Checchino said.

663
00:39:53,690 --> 00:40:00,720
"I don't think Stanley Cooper was the most
hygienic man to walk this planet..."

664
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,720
Kim Watt was alone when the detectives arrived
at her house early that evening.

665
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,980
She opened the door with the same surprised
look on her face that they had seen on their

666
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,410
previous visit.

667
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:16,210
"Do you mind if we ask you a few more questions
about Friday night, Miss Watt?" asked Inspector

668
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,210
Evans.

669
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,630
"Of course not!

670
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,810
Please come in," she said.

671
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:25,400
She led them through the hall-way to the large
kitchen at the back of the house and offered

672
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,820
them a seat at the table.

673
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,319
"Would you like some tea, Officers?"

674
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:30,380
she asked politely.

675
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:35,490
"Oh, that would be great, thank you!" said
Inspector Evans happily.

676
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:39,930
Inspector Checchino was slightly irritated
by the woman trying to be the perfect hostess

677
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,510
and kicked her colleague's leg under the table.

678
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:48,349
"Miss Watt," she began, coming straight to
the point, "we have received a report that

679
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:53,830
you were in central London after 3 a.m. on
the night that Stanley Cooper was shot.

680
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:58,270
Is there a reason why you failed to tell us
this on Saturday?"

681
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,109
Kim put down the kettle and turned to the
two inspectors.

682
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:06,349
She was biting her lip nervously and did not
say a word.

683
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:10,860
"I've got nothing to hide," she said after
a long pause.

684
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,960
"Please just tell us the truth," said Inspector
Evans, who thought that the woman seemed much

685
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,610
more natural than she did when they had first
met.

686
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:24,930
"You have to understand that this is something
I just couldn't tell you the other day.

687
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,410
Not with Bruno right beside me..."

688
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:32,460
She stopped speaking and took a cigarette
out of the box that was lying next to the

689
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,530
sink.

690
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,619
"I did go into town after work, it's true.

691
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:41,591
I was going to go to Lust, but Omar told me
not to, because a lot of the people there

692
00:41:41,591 --> 00:41:42,890
know Bruno.

693
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:46,260
And Bruno himself was there all night on Friday.

694
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,290
So I went to a salsa bar that I like instead.

695
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,680
It's only a few minutes away from Charing
Cross, and I waited there until Omar finished

696
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,680
work."

697
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,109
"Do you remember what time that was?" asked
the inspector.

698
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:02,930
"Oh, about 4 a.m.," Kim Watt replied.

699
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,380
There was another awkward pause in the conversation.

700
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,650
Inspector Evans cleared his throat.

701
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:17,120
"We know that Mr Omari left Trafalgar Square
at 5:30 a.m. on the 134 bus to Finchley, Miss

702
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,650
Watt," he said.

703
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:24,599
"Can you tell us where you and he were before
that time?"

704
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,480
The woman began to blush.

705
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,760
Her pale cheeks were soon almost as red as
her flame-coloured hair.

706
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,030
"We...

707
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:38,430
we visited a hotel where one of Omar's friends
works as a night manager.

708
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:45,630
There are always some empty rooms, and he
lets us use one from time to time, It's just

709
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,670
a bit of fun!"

710
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,140
CHAPTER FIVE

711
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,510
The Fight for Justice

712
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:59,680
Superintendent Fisher entered the incident
room on Tuesday after she walked past and

713
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,349
saw that Inspectors Evans and Checchino were
laughing inside.

714
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:06,569
"What's so funny, you two?"

715
00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:08,079
she asked impatiently.

716
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:14,280
"It's been over three days now and you've
found more questions than answers!"

717
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,520
The two detectives tried to look serious,
but Inspector Evans burst out laughing again.

718
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,300
"Sorry ma'am," he said.

719
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,730
"It's a private joke."

720
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:29,620
The superintendent noticed Inspector Checchino
lifting her hand from Inspector Evans' shoulder.

721
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,119
"Never mind that," she answered.

722
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:36,559
"You need to get to the bottom of this case
before these gangs get out of control."

723
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,540
There had been more violence on Monday night.

724
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,540
Bruno Tartufo had attacked two of Cooper's
henchmen, and they were in hospital.

725
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,220
"We're doing our best, ma'am," said Inspector
Checchino.

726
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:53,030
"We found out today that both the bar manager
and the woman that Cooper was seeing have

727
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,640
a solid alibi.

728
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,690
They were recorded entering and leaving a
hotel."

729
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:01,800
"Who are your other suspects?" asked Superintendent
Fisher.

730
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,150
"For a moment we thought the cleaner might
have been involved," explained Inspector Evans,

731
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,150
smiling slightly.

732
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:12,240
"She has keys to the nightclub, and she's
polish."

733
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,240
"Polish?"

734
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,329
"Well, like the bullets that Vash told us
about," Inspector Evans continued, "But we

735
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:22,510
looked into her background today, and it's
true that she and her family have nothing

736
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:27,230
to do with any gangsters as far as we can
tell."

737
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:31,369
Inspector Checchino was trying to give the
impression that they had more to work with.

738
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:36,750
"There's still a big question mark over Bruno
Tartufo," she said, "He was the last person

739
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,260
on the scene, and nobody can prove his alibi."

740
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:45,590
"And we are watching him very closely," added
Inspector Evans, "He's going to be at Cooper's

741
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:48,990
funeral with the rest of the gang at four
o'clock today."

742
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:54,940
"Fine," the superintendent replied shortly,
"Just make sure that nobody sees members of

743
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:59,300
the police attending the funeral of one of
London's biggest criminals!"

744
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:05,369
"Any news about the search warrant, ma'am?"
asked Inspector Checchino, "Do we have permission

745
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,640
to go to Bruno's house yet?"

746
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,060
"Yes, we should have it ready before the end
of the afternoon."

747
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:18,069
With that, Superintendent Fisher turned around
and left the incident room.

748
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:23,080
Inspectors Evans and Checchino drove to the
crematorium in an unmarked car and waited

749
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,990
outside the gates.

750
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:30,260
They arrived half an hour early so that they
could watch the crowd.

751
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:35,440
Some mourners were already there; many others
soon turned up and formed a long line of black

752
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,329
suits and overcoats outside the building.

753
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:43,589
"I don't like these places at all, Gary,"
said Inspector Checchino quietly when the

754
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:46,470
hearse drove up to the door of the crematorium.

755
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:49,260
"Nobody likes funerals," he smiled.

756
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:54,900
"But I think we can be pleased that Stanley
Cooper has danced his last dance, don't you?"

757
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,510
"I suppose so," she said quietly.

758
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:01,290
"Come on, Sandra, just think about it.

759
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,130
You always said he was a monster.

760
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:08,710
Secretly we both know that he deserved whatever
happened on Friday night.

761
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:12,200
Remember all those drug-related killings last
year?

762
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,160
Only someone as evil as him could have ordered
so many executions.

763
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,369
Omari was right: he had it coming."

764
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:26,349
Inspector Checchino was silent and watched
six fat men lift the coffin onto their shoulders.

765
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:31,720
"He was behind so many other crimes as well,
and we all knew it.

766
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,420
How many cases have we worked on over the
past few years?"

767
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:41,260
"...And he always got away," she said, speaking
over her colleague.

768
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:46,290
This conversation was practically a routine,
but the tense was now new.

769
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,000
Stanley Cooper was history.

770
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,550
"If we're lucky, his gang will be powerless
soon," he continued.

771
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,550
"I..."

772
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:57,960
"I feel sick," she said suddenly, interrupting
him.

773
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,520
Inspector Evans looked across at her in surprise
as she opened the door and stepped out of

774
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,520
the vehicle.

775
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,480
"I just need some fresh air," she said, looking
back into the car.

776
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,880
"The air conditioning in there is making me
nauseous!"

777
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,160
The inspector watched her walk along the grass
with one eye fixed on her long, slim legs.

778
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,440
After a moment, he thought he saw two people
in the crowd staring at Sandra, too.

779
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,670
They looked as if they could have been Bruno
Tartufo's brothers.

780
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:31,200
"I think you've got a couple of admirers here,"
Inspector Evans said when Inspector Checchino

781
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,490
finally returned and got into the car.

782
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,609
"What are you talking about?"

783
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:38,580
"There were two men staring at you.

784
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,390
Didn't you see?"

785
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,390
"Oh...

786
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:42,710
no, not really.

787
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,630
This place is full of criminals today, though,
Gary.

788
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:50,470
I'm sure we've met them all before at one
time or another."

789
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,590
They sat and waited for the funeral to end.

790
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:57,559
Inspector Evans wanted to see whether any
fights would break out between the mourners,

791
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:01,460
or whether any more gangsters would come to
cause trouble.

792
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:07,050
After twenty minutes of near silence, a call
came through on the radio.

793
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:11,329
It was a sergeant at the station who had just
made an arrest.

794
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:14,780
"We've caught the person who set fire to Lust,
sir!"

795
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,040
she said in excitement.

796
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,980
"It was Bruno Tartufo's younger brother, Alessio.

797
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:25,680
He says that Cooper's gang has divided into
two groups: one led by Bruno and the other

798
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,260
by a thug in Walthamstow.

799
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:33,329
This second gang forced him to destroy the
club in order to save his family.

800
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:36,349
He's been very helpful so far because he wants
us to protect him."

801
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:38,540
"Protect him?

802
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,730
What do you mean, we should protect him?"

803
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:44,839
"From the other gang, sir, but from his brother,
too.

804
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:49,260
He says that lately Bruno has been a dangerous
man to be around.

805
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,410
He's also told us who kidnapped those dogs.

806
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:57,320
Apparently Bruno is keeping them in his cellar
as some kind of trophy, but he wants to either

807
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,180
sell them or shoot them.

808
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,910
He sees himself as the next big cheese!"

809
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:04,700
"Let's get going!" said Inspector Checchino.

810
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:10,710
"We should go to Tartufo's house before he
gets back from this funeral."

811
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:15,990
Bruno Tartufo owned a large house in Chelsea
that was twice as large as Kim Watt's.

812
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:20,400
The two detectives did not yet have a search
warrant, but they had a good reason to believe

813
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,080
that a crime was taking place in the cellar.

814
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,760
It meant they could go inside.

815
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,010
The old Italian woman who let them in did
not ask many questions.

816
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:34,369
When she said that she did not have a key
to the cellar, Inspector Evans kicked open

817
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:36,740
the door without thinking twice.

818
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:41,560
Immediately, six brown dogs ran up the stairs
and jumped all over him.

819
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,020
One even started to lick his face as if it
were a giant ice cream.

820
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:50,890
During the chaos that followed, Inspector
Checchino carefully stepped downstairs into

821
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:53,070
the darkness of the cellar.

822
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:57,630
It was her only chance, and she decided to
take it.

823
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:02,940
She slowly pulled out a small box from her
coat pocket and placed it on a table at the

824
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,120
far end of the room.

825
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:12,670
It contained around two dozen bullets that
she had bought undercover on the black market.

826
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:17,329
As she turned around to leave the cellar,
a hand came out of the shadows and landed

827
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:19,359
on her shoulder.

828
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:26,230
"Sandra," said a concerned voice, "what the
hell are you doing?!"

829
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:30,650
She looked up at Inspector Evans, who was
shaking his head in disbelief.

830
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,950
He had a bad feeling about what she was about
to say.

831
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,440
"I was just taking a look at these bullets,"
she began.

832
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,160
"Don't lie to me!

833
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,230
I saw you put them there."

834
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:46,319
Inspector Checchino paused and looked around
the room.

835
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:52,940
"Gary, we've been trying all year to bring
Cooper to justice, but he always got away.

836
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,030
You know how he operated.

837
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:59,339
He always had a puppet in place to take the
blame for what he did.

838
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:02,920
And Bruno is no better - he would kill his
own mother."

839
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,609
"I can't believe this!" he hissed.

840
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:10,940
"That's not how justice works!"

841
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,319
"Justice?

842
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,619
Let me tell you about justice, Gary.

843
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:19,550
I'm sure you don't remember a young man who
committed suicide in Camberwell twelve months

844
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:20,880
ago," she began.

845
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,630
"No, I can't say that I do.

846
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,970
There are a lot of suicides in London."

847
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,150
"You're right, there are.

848
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,470
But this wasn't really a suicide.

849
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:34,470
Everyone just assumed that it was..."

850
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,520
"How can you know that?" he asked.

851
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,559
"Who are you talking about?"

852
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:43,079
"It was a university student," Inspector Checchino
said flatly.

853
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:45,240
"Matthew Puglisi."

854
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,870
Inspector Evans looked her in the eye.

855
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:51,730
He moved his hand down from her shoulder to
her hand and squeezed it.

856
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:56,880
"He wasn't just a student, was he?" he asked
calmly.

857
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:03,910
"No, Gary," she said and looked down at the
floor, "He... he was my nephew.

858
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:08,110
He was killed one year ago on Friday night."

859
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:12,490
Inspector Checchino looked back up at Inspector
Evans with tears in her eyes.

860
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:17,520
"He was my nephew, and he told me that he
was in trouble with some drug dealers at a

861
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,450
nightclub in Charing Cross.

862
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:22,589
I think you can guess which one.

863
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:28,010
He'd even received some death threats, but
he was too afraid to talk to the police - apart

864
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:30,390
from me, that is."

865
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,869
"Are you serious?

866
00:52:32,869 --> 00:52:35,660
You were behind the whole thing?"

867
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,910
She thought of the two men at the funeral.

868
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:42,390
They were her cousins, and they had helped
to arrange her meeting with Cooper.

869
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:46,010
"Yes, Gary, just little old me.

870
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,859
Cooper let me into the club because he thought
he was going to get some information about

871
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:51,569
his enemies...

872
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:53,400
it was easy.

873
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,790
A little charm and a little lipstick go a
long way.

874
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:00,460
And I thought it would be easy to blame Tartufo.

875
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,270
You know it would."

876
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:06,390
"Sandra, you must realize that I can't let
it go," he said.

877
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:11,140
"You can do whatever you want," she replied
quietly.

878
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,660
She was now the one squeezing his hand.

879
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:18,990
Inspector Evans took a deep breath and sighed.

880
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:22,799
Inspector Checchino was his friend, but a
murder was a murder.

881
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:27,369
"We can't all go out there and take an eye
for an eye!" he cried.

882
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:30,630
"We have Alessio Tartufo now.

883
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:34,390
He will tell us everything we need so that
we can arrest his brother.

884
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:37,619
As for you, what can I say?"

885
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:42,549
"I'm sure you'll do whatever you think is
right, Gary."

886
00:53:42,549 --> 00:54:24,059
He growled and went back upstairs, leaving
Inspector Checchino in 

887
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:27,970
the dark.
