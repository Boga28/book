CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:05,850
Before the War

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,650
In the last years of the nineteenth century,
no one believed that this world was being

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:17,240
watched closely by intelligences greater than
our own.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,210
We had no idea that we were being studied
almost as carefully as a scientist studies

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,380
the small creatures in a drop of water.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:34,360
With great confidence, people travelled around
this world and believed that they were in

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,690
control of their lives.

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,150
No one gave a thought to possible threats
from other planets.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:50,120
At most, people believed there might be living
things on Mars, perhaps less developed than

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,079
us and ready to welcome visitors.

12
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:00,640
But across the great emptiness of space, more
intelligent minds than ours looked at this

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:11,030
Earth with jealous eyes, and slowly and surely
made their plans against us.

14
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:18,100
And early in the twentieth century, the great
shock came.

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,850
The planet Mars, I need not remind the reader,
goes around the sun at an average distance

16
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:31,900
of 224,000,000 kilometres, and receives from
the sun half of the light and heat that is

17
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,010
received by this world.

18
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:41,729
It must be, if scientific thinking is correct,
older than our world, and life on its surface

19
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,770
began a long time before this Earth cooled
down.

20
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,229
Because it is hardly one seventh of the size
of Earth, it cooled more quickly to the temperature

21
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,270
at which life could begin.

22
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:01,440
It has air and water and all that is necessary
to support living things.

23
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,470
But people are so blind that no writer, before
the end of the nineteenth century, suggested

24
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,280
that much more intelligent life had developed
there than on Earth.

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,340
It was also not generally understood that
because Mars is older and smaller than our

26
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:28,930
Earth, and further from the sun, it is nearer
life's end as well as further from its beginning.

27
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,069
Mars is getting colder, as one day our planet
must too.

28
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:38,951
Its physical condition is still largely a
mystery, but we know that even in the middle

29
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:45,959
of the day, in its warmest areas, the temperature
is lower than during our coldest winter.

30
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:52,730
Its air is much thinner than ours, its oceans
have become smaller until they cover only

31
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:02,800
a third of its surface, and from its far north
and south the ice is steadily moving forwards.

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:11,489
The end of all life, which is a distant possibility
for us, is an immediate problem for the Martians.

33
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:19,080
This has brightened their intelligence, increased
their abilities and hardened their hearts.

34
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,230
And looking across space, with instruments
and minds more powerful than we can dream

35
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:34,260
of, they see, at a distance of only 56,000,000
kilometres, a morning star of hope - our own

36
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,620
warmer planet with its green land and grey
seas, its cloudy atmosphere and its growing

37
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,069
population.

38
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:49,610
We, the people who live on this Earth, must
seem to them at least as different and less

39
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,540
developed as monkeys are to us.

40
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,200
And before we criticize them for thinking
in this way, we must remember how badly we

41
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,140
have treated not only the animals of this
planet, but also other people.

42
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:15,080
Can we really complain that the Martians treated
us in the same way?

43
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,870
It seems that the Martians calculated their
journey very cleverly - their mathematical

44
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,029
knowledge appears to be much more developed
than ours.

45
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:34,279
During 1894, a great light was seen on the
surface of the planet by a number of astronomers.

46
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:42,499
I now believe that this was a fire built to
make an enormous gun in a very deep pit.

47
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:47,419
From this gun, their shots were fired at us.

48
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:51,180
The attack came six years ago.

49
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,559
Towards midnight on 12 August, one astronomer
noticed a great cloud of hot gas on the surface

50
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:59,500
of the planet.

51
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,849
In fact, he compared it to the burning gases
that might rush out from a gun.

52
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:10,080
This, we now know, was a very accurate description.

53
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,999
However, the next day there was no report
in the newspapers except one small note in

54
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:23,160
the Daily Telegraph, and the world knew nothing
of one of the greatest dangers that ever threatened

55
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,520
Earth.

56
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,129
I do not think I would have known anything
about it myself if I had not met Ogilvy, the

57
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,569
well-known astronomer.

58
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:39,050
He was very excited at the news and invited
me to spend the night with him, watching the

59
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,789
red planet.

60
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:47,280
Despite everything that has happened since,
I still remember that night very clearly.

61
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,719
Looking through the telescope, I saw a circle
of deep blue with the little round planet

62
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:56,120
in the centre.

63
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,379
Because it was so small, I did not see the
Thing they were sending us, which was flying

64
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,840
quickly towards me across that great distance.

65
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,689
I never dreamed of it then, as I watched.

66
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:15,289
Nobody on Earth knew anything about the approaching
missile.

67
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:21,050
That night, too, there was another sudden
cloud of gas from the distant planet as a

68
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:27,310
second missile started on its way to Earth
from Mars, just under twenty-four hours after

69
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,399
the first one.

70
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:39,150
I saw a reddish flash at the edge, the slightest
bend in its shape, as the clock struck midnight.

71
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:44,369
I remember how I sat there in the blackness,
not suspecting the meaning of the tiny light

72
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:48,990
I had seen and all the trouble that it would
cause me.

73
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:56,009
I told Ogilvy, and he took my place and watched
the cloud of gas growing as it rose from the

74
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,589
surface of the planet.

75
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:05,990
He watched until one, and then we lit the
lamp and walked over to his house.

76
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,039
Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night
and the following night, at about midnight,

77
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,619
and again the night after that.

78
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:18,929
For ten nights they saw a flame each night.

79
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:24,219
No one on Earth has attempted to explain why
the shots ended after this.

80
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:29,699
It may be that the gases from the firing caused
the Martians inconvenience.

81
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:36,309
Thick clouds of smoke or dust, which looked
like little grey, moving spots through a powerful

82
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:42,219
telescope on Earth, spread through the clearness
of the planet's atmosphere and hid its more

83
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:45,139
familiar features.

84
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:50,069
Even the daily papers woke up to these events
at last, and there was much discussion of

85
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,489
their cause.

86
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:59,039
But no one suspected the truth, that the Martians
had fired missiles, which were now rushing

87
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:06,749
towards us at a speed of many kilometres a
second across the great emptiness of space.

88
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:15,279
It seems to me almost unbelievably wonderful
that, with that danger threatening us, people

89
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,719
could continue their ordinary business as
they did.

90
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:26,449
One night, when the first missile was probably
less than 15,000,000 kilometres away, I went

91
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,819
for a walk with my wife.

92
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:35,930
I pointed out Mars, a bright spot of light
rising in the sky, towards which so many telescopes

93
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,390
were pointing.

94
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,680
The night was warm.

95
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,110
Coming home, a group of party-goers from Chertsey
passed us, singing and playing music.

96
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:52,320
There were lights in the upper windows of
the houses as people went to bed.

97
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,370
From the distant railway station came the
sound of trains.

98
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,269
The world seemed so safe and peaceful.

99
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:02,269
CHAPTER TWO

100
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:06,899
The Falling Star

101
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,069
Only a few nights later, the first falling
star was seen towards the east.

102
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:18,009
Denning, our greatest astronomer, said that
the height of its first appearance was about

103
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:21,480
one hundred and fifty kilometres.

104
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,730
It seemed to him that it fell to Earth about
a hundred kilometres east of him.

105
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:32,310
I was at home at the time and writing in my
study with the curtains open.

106
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:40,180
If I had looked up I would have seen the strangest
thing that ever fell to Earth from space,

107
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,510
but I did not.

108
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,759
Many people in that part of England saw it,
and simply thought that another meteorite

109
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,070
had fallen.

110
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:53,279
Nobody went to look for the fallen star that
night.

111
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,290
But poor Ogilvy had seen it fall and so he
got up very early with the idea of finding

112
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,779
it.

113
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,439
This he did, soon after dawn.

114
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:09,880
An enormous hole had been made and the Earth
had been thrown violently in every direction,

115
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,560
forming piles that could be seen two kilometres
away.

116
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,920
The Thing itself lay almost completely buried
in the earth.

117
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,319
The uncovered part looked like an enormous
cylinder, about thirty metres across each

118
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:29,850
end.

119
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:36,240
It was covered with a thick burnt skin, which
softened its edges.

120
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,139
He approached it, surprised at the size and
even more surprised at the shape, since most

121
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:45,939
meteorites are fairly round.

122
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:51,209
It was, however, still very hot from its flight
through the air and he could not get close

123
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,529
to it.

124
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:59,330
He could hear movement from inside but thought
this was due to it cooling down.

125
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,540
He did not imagine that it might be hollow.

126
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,399
He remained standing on one side of the pit
that the Thing had made for itself, staring

127
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,920
at its strange appearance and thinking that
there might be some intelligent design in

128
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,149
its shape.

129
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,470
He was alone on the common.

130
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,570
Then suddenly, he noticed that some of the
burnt skin was falling off the round edge

131
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,440
at the end.

132
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,980
A large piece suddenly came off with a sharp
noise that brought his heart into his mouth.

133
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,990
For a minute he hardly realized what this
meant, and although the heat was great, he

134
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,980
climbed down into the pit to see the cylinder
more closely.

135
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:50,649
He realized that, very slowly, the round top
of the cylinder was turning.

136
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:57,980
Even then he hardly understood what was happening,
until he heard another sound and saw the black

137
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,160
mark jump forwards a little.

138
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,279
Then he suddenly understood.

139
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,709
The cylinder was artificial - hollow - with
an end that screwed out!

140
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:15,730
Something inside the cylinder was unscrewing
the top!

141
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,160
'Good heavens!' said Ogilvy.

142
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,750
'There's a man in it - men in it!

143
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,660
Half burnt to death!

144
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,890
Trying to escape!'

145
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:33,170
At once, thinking quickly, he connected the
Thing with the flash on Mars.

146
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:39,480
The thought of the creature trapped inside
was so terrible to him that he forgot the

147
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,079
heat, and went forwards to the cylinder to
help.

148
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:48,529
But luckily the heat stopped him before he
could get his hands on the metal.

149
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:56,600
He stood undecided for a moment, then climbed
out of the pit and started to run into Woking.

150
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,910
The time then was around six o'clock.

151
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:08,410
He met some local people who were up early,
but the story he told and his appearance were

152
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,920
so wild that they would not listen to him.

153
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,889
That quieted him a little, and when he saw
Henderson, the London journalist, in his garden,

154
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:23,279
he shouted over the fence and made himself
understood.

155
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,769
'Henderson,' he called, 'you saw that meteorite
last night?'

156
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:31,209
'Yes,' said Henderson.

157
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:33,649
'What about it?'

158
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:37,600
'It's out on Horsell Common now.'

159
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,389
'Fallen meteorite!' said Henderson.

160
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:43,290
'That's good.'

161
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,190
'But it's something more than a meteorite.

162
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,720
It's a cylinder - an artificial cylinder!

163
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,309
And there's something inside.'

164
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:58,339
'What did you say?' he asked.

165
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,459
He was deaf in one ear.

166
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:08,290
When Ogilvy told him all he had seen, Henderson
dropped his spade, put on his jacket and came

167
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,069
out into the road.

168
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:16,570
The two men hurried back at once to the common,
and found the cylinder still lying in the

169
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,850
same position.

170
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:25,339
But now the sounds inside had stopped, and
a thin circle of bright metal showed between

171
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,750
its top and body.

172
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:34,730
They listened, knocked on the burnt metal
with a rock and, getting no answer, they both

173
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:40,709
decided that the men inside were either unconscious
or dead.

174
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:46,480
Of course the two were quite unable to do
anything, so they went back to the town again

175
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,149
to get help.

176
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:55,610
Henderson went to the railway station at once,
to send a telegram to London.

177
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:01,910
By eight o'clock a number of boys and unemployed
men were already walking to the common to

178
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,149
see the 'dead men from Mars'.

179
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:08,850
That was the form the story took.

180
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:14,569
I heard it first from my newspaper boy at
about a quarter to nine and I went to the

181
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:17,499
common immediately.

182
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:23,230
When I got there, I found a little crowd of
perhaps twenty people surrounding the great

183
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,470
pit in which the cylinder lay.

184
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,449
Henderson and Ogilvy were not there.

185
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:34,810
I think they understood that nothing could
be done for the moment, and had gone away

186
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,350
to have breakfast at Henderson's house.

187
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,519
I climbed into the pit and thought I heard
a faint movement under my feet.

188
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,319
The top had certainly stopped turning.

189
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:53,660
At that time it was quite clear in my own
mind that the Thing had come from the planet

190
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,019
Mars, and I felt impatient to see it opened.

191
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:04,540
At about eleven, as nothing was happening,
I walked back, full of such thoughts, to my

192
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,800
home in Maybury.

193
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,369
By the afternoon the appearance of the common
had changed very much.

194
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:17,930
The early editions of the evening papers had
shocked London.

195
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,069
They printed stories like:

196
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:24,199
MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS AMAZING STORY FROM
WOKING

197
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:30,610
There was now a large crowd of people standing
around.

198
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,940
Going to the edge of the pit, I found a group
of men in it - Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall

199
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:42,769
fair-haired man I afterwards learnt was Stent,
the Astronomer Royal, with several workmen

200
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,240
holding spades.

201
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,360
Stent was giving directions.

202
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,980
A large part of the cylinder had now been
uncovered, although its lower end was still

203
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,399
hidden in the side of the pit.

204
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,819
As soon as Ogilvy saw me, he called me to
come down, and asked me if I would mind going

205
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:06,120
over to see Lord Hilton, who owned the land.

206
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:13,209
The growing crowd, he said, was now becoming
a serious problem, especially the boys.

207
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:17,570
He wanted a fence put up to keep the people
back.

208
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,699
I was very glad to do as he asked.

209
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:26,309
I failed to find Lord Hilton at his house,
but was told he was expected from London by

210
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:28,120
the six o'clock train.

211
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:35,000
As it was then about a quarter past five,
I went home, had some tea and walked up to

212
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,510
the station to meet him.

213
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,279
CHAPTER THREE

214
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,340
The Cylinder Opens

215
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,440
When I returned to the common, the sun was
setting.

216
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,610
Groups of people were hurrying from the direction
of Woking.

217
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:56,059
The crowd around the pit had increased to
a couple of hundred people, perhaps.

218
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:00,740
There were raised voices, and some sort of
struggle appeared to be going on around the

219
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,700
pit.

220
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,590
As I got nearer, I heard Stent's voice:

221
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,970
'Keep back!

222
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,359
Keep back!

223
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,359
'

224
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,399
A boy came running towards me.

225
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:18,350
'It's moving,' he said to me as he passed,
'- unscrewing and unscrewing.

226
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,190
I don't like it.

227
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,320
I'm going home.'

228
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,520
I went on to the crowd and pushed my way through.

229
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,160
Everyone seemed greatly excited.

230
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,260
I heard a peculiar humming sound from the
pit.

231
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,520
'Keep those fools back,' said Ogilvy.

232
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,350
'We don't know what's in the Thing, you know.'

233
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:48,419
I saw a young man - I believe he was a shop
assistant in Woking - standing on the cylinder

234
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,929
and trying to climb out of the pit again.

235
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,230
The crowd had pushed him in.

236
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,309
The end of the cylinder was being screwed
out from within.

237
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:03,010
Nearly half a meter of shining screw stuck
out.

238
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:08,490
Someone pushed against me, and I almost fell
down on top of the screw.

239
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:15,310
I turned, and as I did the screw came out
and the lid of the cylinder fell onto the

240
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,600
sand with a ringing sound.

241
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:25,510
I pressed back against the person behind me,
and turned my head towards the Thing again.

242
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:32,799
I had the sunset in my eyes and for a moment
the round hole seemed black.

243
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,720
I think everyone expected to see a man come
out - possibly something a little unlike us

244
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,590
on Earth, but more or less a man.

245
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,179
I know I did.

246
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:53,559
But, looking, I soon saw something grey moving
within the shadow, then two shining circles

247
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,070
- like eyes.

248
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:01,830
Then something like a little grey snake, about
the thickness of a walking-stick, came out

249
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:08,779
of the middle and moved through the air towards
me - and then another.

250
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:12,029
I suddenly felt very cold.

251
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:14,809
There was a loud scream from a woman behind.

252
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:20,700
I half-turned, still keeping my eyes on the
cylinder, from which other tentacles were

253
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,490
now coming out, and began pushing my way back
from the side of the pit.

254
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:32,399
I saw shock changing to horror on the faces
of the people around me, and there was a general

255
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:35,140
movement backwards.

256
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:42,440
I found myself alone, and saw the people on
the other side of the pit running off.

257
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,750
I looked again at the cylinder, and felt great
terror.

258
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:59,370
A big, greyish round creature, the size, perhaps,
of a bear, was rising slowly and painfully

259
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,070
out of the cylinder.

260
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:08,029
As it moved up and caught the light, it shone
like wet leather.

261
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:13,280
Two large dark- colored eyes were looking
at me steadily.

262
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:20,360
The head of the thing was rounded and had,
one could say, a face.

263
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,960
There was a mouth under the eyes, and its
lipless edge shone wetly.

264
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,720
The whole creature was breathing heavily.

265
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,640
One tentacle held onto the cylinder; another
moved in the air.

266
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,919
Suddenly, the creature disappeared.

267
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,470
It had fallen over the edge of the cylinder
and into the pit.

268
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:52,630
I heard it give a peculiar cry, and then another
of these creatures appeared in the deep shadow

269
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,990
of the door.

270
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:01,890
I turned and ran madly towards the first group
of trees, perhaps a hundred metres away.

271
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:07,580
I fell a number of times because I was running
with my head turned round.

272
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,600
I could not take my eyes away from these creatures.

273
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,809
The common was now covered with small groups
of people.

274
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:22,830
They were all very frightened, but still interested
in the strange happenings in the pit.

275
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:28,360
Then I saw a round object moving up and down.

276
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,850
It was the head of the shop assistant who
had fallen in, looking black against the hot

277
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,620
western sky.

278
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,950
He got his shoulder and knee up, but again
he seemed to slip back until only his head

279
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,770
was visible.

280
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:51,899
Then he disappeared, and I thought I heard
a faint scream.

281
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:57,700
For a moment I wanted to go back and help
him, but I was too afraid.

282
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,679
The sun went down before anything else happened.

283
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,870
The crowd around the pit seemed to grow as
new people arrived.

284
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:14,710
This gave people confidence and as darkness
fell, a slow, uncertain movement on the common

285
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,679
began.

286
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:24,980
Black figures in twos and threes moved forwards,
stopped, watched, and moved again, getting

287
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,520
closer and closer to the pit.

288
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:35,230
And then, coming from the direction of Horsell,
I noticed a little black group of men, the

289
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,179
first of whom was waving a white flag.

290
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:44,400
They were too far away for me to recognize
anyone there, but I learned afterwards that

291
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:52,019
Ogilvy, Stent and Henderson were with others
in this attempt at communication.

292
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:57,350
As the group moved forwards, a number of other
people started to follow them.

293
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:03,840
Suddenly, there was a flash of light and bright
greenish smoke came out of the pit in three

294
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,210
separate clouds, which moved up, one after
the other, into the still air.

295
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:17,789
The smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be a better
word for it) was so bright that the deep blue

296
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:23,510
sky overhead seemed to darken as these clouds
rose.

297
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:32,860
At the same time we could hear a faint sound,
which changed into a long, loud humming noise.

298
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:41,840
Slowly a dark shape rose out of the pit and
a beam of light seemed to flash out from it.

299
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,021
Then flashes of bright fire came from the
men, and I realized that the Martians were

300
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:50,850
using some kind of invisible ray.

301
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:58,220
Then, by the light of their own burning, I
saw each of the men falling, and their followers

302
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,169
turning to run.

303
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:06,160
I stood staring, watching as man after man
fell over.

304
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:13,630
As the unseen ray of light passed over them,
trees caught fire and even the bushes exploded

305
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,080
into flame.

306
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:23,090
And far away to the west I saw flashes of
trees and bushes and wooden buildings suddenly

307
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,909
set on fire.

308
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:35,090
This flaming death, this invisible sword of
heat, was sweeping round quickly and steadily.

309
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:40,510
I knew it was coming towards me because of
the flashing bushes it touched, but I was

310
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,700
too shocked to move.

311
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:49,919
All along a curving line beyond the pit, the
dark ground smoked.

312
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:59,639
Then the humming stopped and the black, rounded
object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.

313
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:05,480
All this happened so quickly that I stood
without moving, shocked by the flashes of

314
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
light.

315
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,679
It that death had swung round a full circle,
it would have killed me.

316
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:23,590
But it passed and let me live, and left the
night around me suddenly dark and unfamiliar.

317
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,750
There was nobody else around.

318
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:32,660
Overhead the stars were coming out, and in
the west the sky was still a pale, bright,

319
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,020
almost greenish blue.

320
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:42,700
The tops of the trees and the roofs of Horsell
were sharp and black against the western sky.

321
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:50,190
Areas of bush and a few trees still smoked,
and the houses towards Woking station were

322
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:56,360
sending up tongues of flame into the stillness
of the evening air.

323
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,919
I realized that I was helpless and alone on
this dark common.

324
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:09,899
Suddenly, like a thing falling on me from
above, came fear.

325
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:15,320
With an effort I turned and began an unsteady
run through the grass.

326
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:24,159
The fear I felt was panic - terror not only
of the Martians but of the dark and stillness

327
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,649
all around me.

328
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:31,850
I ran crying silently as a child might do.

329
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,110
After I had turned, I did not dare look back.

330
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,820
CHAPTER FOUR

331
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,029
Mars Attacks

332
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:48,019
I ran until I was totally exhausted and I
fell down beside the road.

333
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:51,370
That was near the bridge by the gas-works.

334
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,320
I remained there for some time.

335
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,850
Eventually I sat up, strangely puzzled.

336
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:05,360
For a moment, perhaps, I could not clearly
understand how I came there.

337
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,070
My terror had fallen from me like a piece
of clothing.

338
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:16,019
A few minutes earlier there had only been
three things in my mind: the great size of

339
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:23,810
the night and space and nature, my own weakness
and unhappiness, and the near approach of

340
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,870
death.

341
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,639
Now I was my normal self again - an ordinary
citizen.

342
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:38,559
The silent common, my escape, the flames,
seemed like a dream.

343
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,220
I asked myself if these things had really
happened.

344
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,909
I could not believe it.

345
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:50,510
I got up and walked up the steep slope to
the bridge.

346
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,149
My body seemed to have lost its strength.

347
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:58,159
The figure of a workman carrying a basket
appeared.

348
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,860
Beside him ran a little boy He passed me,
wishing me good-night.

349
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,370
I thought about speaking to him, but did not.

350
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:14,240
I answered his greeting and went on over the
bridge.

351
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,529
Two men and a woman were talking at the gate
of one of the houses.

352
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:19,799
I stopped.

353
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,070
'What news from the common?'

354
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,330
I said.

355
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:27,470
'Eh?' said one of the men, turning.

356
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,769
'What news from the common?'

357
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:30,769
I repeated.

358
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,820
'Haven't you just been there?'

359
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,830
the men asked.

360
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:40,380
'People seem fairly silly about the common,'
the woman said over the gate.

361
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,509
'What's it all about?'

362
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:46,279
'Haven't you heard of the men from Mars?'

363
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,279
I said.

364
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,360
'The creatures from Mars.'

365
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,639
'Quite enough,' said the woman.

366
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:53,720
'Thanks.'

367
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,480
And all three of them laughed.

368
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,010
I felt foolish and angry.

369
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,100
I tried but could not tell them what I had
seen.

370
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,779
They laughed again at my broken sentences.

371
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:14,639
'You'll hear more soon," I said, and went
on to my home.

372
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:20,539
My wife was shocked when she saw me, because
I looked so tired and dirty.

373
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:26,029
I went into the dining-room, sat down, and
told her the things that I had seen.

374
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:31,409
'There is one good thing,' I said, to calm
her fears.

375
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:37,049
'They are the slowest, fattest things I ever
saw crawl.

376
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:41,799
They may stay in the pit and kill people who
come near them, as they cannot get out of

377
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:47,030
it . . . but they are so horrible!'

378
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,970
'Don't, dear!' said my wife, putting her hand
on mine.

379
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,710
'Poor Ogilvy!'

380
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,450
I said.

381
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,730
'He may be lying dead there.'

382
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:05,240
My wife, at least, did not think my experience
unbelievable.

383
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:11,370
When I saw how white her face was, I began
to comfort her and myself by repeating all

384
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:18,330
that Ogilvy had told me about the impossibility
of Martians capturing the Earth.

385
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:23,790
On the surface of the Earth the force of gravity
is three times as great as on the surface

386
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,580
of Mars.

387
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,559
A Martian, therefore, would weigh three times
more than on Mars, although his strength would

388
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,460
be the same.

389
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,299
That was the general opinion.

390
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:42,559
Both The Times and the Daily Telegraph, for
example, said this very confidently the next

391
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,559
morning.

392
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:51,110
Both ignored, as I did, two obvious problems
with this theory.

393
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:57,260
The atmosphere of Earth, we now know, contains
much more oxygen than there is on Mars.

394
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:02,049
This certainly gave the Martians much greater
strength.

395
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:07,870
And we also learned that the Martians were
so mechanically clever that they did not need

396
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,389
to use their bodies very much.

397
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:16,899
But I did not consider these points at the
time, and so I thought the Martians had very

398
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:20,049
little chance of success.

399
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:26,740
With wine and food and the need to help my
wife feel less afraid, I slowly became braver

400
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,980
and felt safer.

401
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:36,450
I remember the dinner table that evening very
clearly even now: my dear wife's sweet, worried

402
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:43,220
face looking at me from under the pink lamp-shade,
the white cloth laid with silver and glass,

403
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,830
the glass of red wine in my hand.

404
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:54,110
I did not know it, but that was the last proper
dinner I would eat for many strange and terrible

405
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,880
days.

406
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,509
If, on that Friday night, you had drawn a
circle at a distance of five kilometres from

407
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:08,940
Horsell Common, I doubt if there would have
been one human being outside it, unless it

408
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:16,030
was a relation of Stent, whose emotions or
habits were affected by the new arrivals.

409
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:21,299
Many people had heard of the cylinder, of
course, and talked about it, but it did not

410
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,700
have as much effect as a political event.

411
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:31,840
Even within the five - kilometer circle, most
people were unaffected.

412
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,519
I have already described the behaviour of
the people to whom I spoke.

413
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:39,980
All over the district people were eating dinner.

414
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:48,549
Men were gardening, children were being put
to bed, young people were out walking together.

415
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:53,820
Maybe there was talk in the village streets,
a new topic in the pubs - and here and there

416
00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:00,970
a messenger, or even an eye-witness of the
later events, caused some excitement.

417
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:08,820
However, for most of the time the daily routine
of work, food, drink and sleep went on as

418
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,770
it had done for countless years.

419
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:19,110
People came to the common and left it, but
all the time a crowd remained.

420
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:24,370
One or two adventurous people went into the
darkness and crawled quite near the Martians,

421
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:32,050
but they never returned, because now and again
a light-ray swept round the common, and the

422
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:35,140
Heat-Ray was ready to follow.

423
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:40,810
And all night the sound of hammering could
be heard as the Martians worked on the machines

424
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,330
they were making ready.

425
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:51,920
At about eleven, a company of soldiers came
through Horsell and spread out in a great

426
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,200
circle around the common.

427
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,390
Several officers had been on the common earlier
in the day and one was reported to be missing.

428
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:07,020
Another one arrived and was busy questioning
the crowd at midnight.

429
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,510
The army was certainly taking things seriously.

430
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:17,890
A few seconds after midnight the crowd in
the Chertsey Road, Woking, saw a star fall

431
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:22,310
from the sky into the woods to the north-west.

432
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:27,460
This was the second cylinder.

433
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,660
Saturday lives in my memory as a day of worry.

434
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,000
It was a lazy, hot day too.

435
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,180
I had only slept a little and I got up early.

436
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:47,790
I went into my garden and stood listening,
but towards the common there was nothing moving.

437
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:52,820
The milkman came as usual and I asked him
the latest news.

438
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:59,470
He told me that during the night the Martians
had been surrounded by soldiers and that field-guns

439
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,200
were expected.

440
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:10,120
'We have to try not to kill them,' he said,
'if it can possibly be avoided.'

441
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:17,080
After breakfast, instead of working, I decided
to walk down towards the common.

442
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:23,040
Under the railway bridge I found a group of
soldiers - engineers, I think, men wearing

443
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,030
small round caps, dirty red jackets and dark
trousers.

444
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:33,570
They told me that no one was allowed over
the bridge.

445
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:38,810
I talked with them for a time and told them
of my sight of the Martians on the previous

446
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,810
evening.

447
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:45,610
None had seen them, so they asked me many
questions.

448
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:51,920
An ordinary engineer is much better educated
than a common soldier, and they discussed,

449
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,370
with some intelligence, the odd conditions
of the possible fight.

450
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:03,760
After some time I left them and went on to
the railway station to get as many morning

451
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,610
papers as I could.

452
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:12,870
These contained only very inaccurate descriptions
of the killing of Stent, Henderson, Ogilvy

453
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,750
and the others.

454
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:22,570
I got back to lunch at about two, very tired
because, as I have said, the day was extremely

455
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,610
hot and dull.

456
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:30,400
To make myself feel better I took a cold bath
in the afternoon.

457
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,860
During that day the Martians did not show
themselves.

458
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:42,650
They were busy in the pit, and there was the
sound of hammering and a column of smoke.

459
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:47,920
'New attempts have been made to signal, but
without success,' was how the evening papers

460
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,910
later described it.

461
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:57,240
An engineer told me that this was done by
a man crawling forwards with a flag on a long

462
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
pole.

463
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,550
The Martians took as much notice of him as
we would of a cow.

464
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:10,250
At about three o'clock I heard the sound of
a gun, firing regularly, from the direction

465
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,250
of Chertsey.

466
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:17,780
I learned that they were shooting into the
wood in which the second cylinder had fallen.

467
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:28,690
An hour or two later a field-gun arrived for
use against the first cylinder.

468
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:34,780
At about six in the evening, as I had tea
with my wife in the garden, I heard an explosion

469
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:41,340
from the common, and immediately after that
the sound of gunfire.

470
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:47,160
Then came a violent crash quite close to us,
that shook the ground.

471
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:53,370
I rushed out onto the grass and saw the tops
of the trees around the Oriental College burst

472
00:38:53,370 --> 00:39:01,790
into smoky red flame, and the tower of the
little church beside it slide down into ruins.

473
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:06,910
The roof of the college was in pieces.

474
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:12,140
Then one of our chimneys cracked and broken
bricks fell down onto the flower-bed by my

475
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,400
study window.

476
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,650
My wife and I stood amazed.

477
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:24,250
Then I realized that the Martians could hit
the top of Maybury Hill with their Heat-Ray

478
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,520
because they had cleared the college out of
the way.

479
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:34,640
After that I took my wife's arm and ran with
her out into the road.

480
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,750
Then I went back and fetched the servant.

481
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:45,480
'We can't stay here,' I said, and as I spoke
the firing started again for a moment on the

482
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,480
common.

483
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,330
'But where can we go?' said my wife in terror.

484
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,870
I thought, puzzled.

485
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:57,410
Then I remembered my cousins in Leatherhead.

486
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,410
'Leatherhead!'

487
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:02,990
I shouted above the sudden noise.

488
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:06,360
She looked away from me downhill.

489
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,830
Surprised people were coming out of their
houses.

490
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:12,090
'How will we get to Leatherhead?'

491
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,350
she asked.

492
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:19,490
Down the hill I saw some soldiers rush under
the railway bridge.

493
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:25,760
Three went through the open doors of the Oriental
College and two began running from house to

494
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,890
house.

495
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:33,700
The sun, shining through the smoke that rose
up from the tops of the trees, seemed blood-red

496
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,230
and threw an unfamiliar bright light on everything.

497
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,740
'Wait here,' I said.

498
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,690
'You are safe here.'

499
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:49,070
I ran at once towards the pub, whose owner
had a horse and cart.

500
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:56,400
I ran because I realized that soon everyone
on this side of the hill would be moving.

501
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,440
I found the pub's owner in his bar, with no
idea of what was going on.

502
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,290
I explained quickly that I had to leave my
home, and arranged to borrow the cart, promising

503
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:11,580
to bring it back before midnight.

504
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:17,780
At the time it did not seem to me so urgent
that he should leave his home.

505
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:23,610
I drove the cart down the road and, leaving
it with my wife and servant, rushed into the

506
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:28,030
house and packed a few valuables.

507
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,490
While I was doing this, a soldier ran past.

508
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:36,300
He was going from house to house, warning
people to leave.

509
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,620
I shouted after him, 'What news?'

510
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:47,230
He turned, stared, shouted something about
'crawling out in a thing like a dish cover',

511
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:51,170
and moved on to the gate of the next house.

512
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:56,400
I helped my servant into the back of the cart,
then jumped up into the driver's seat beside

513
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,270
my wife.

514
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:03,680
In another moment we were clear of the smoke
and the noise, and moving quickly down the

515
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,740
opposite side of Maybury Hill.

516
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,140
CHAPTER FIVE

517
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,140
Running Away

518
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:16,200
Leatherhead is about twenty kilometres from
Maybury.

519
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,260
We got there without any problems at about
nine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's

520
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:28,180
rest while I had supper with my cousins and
left my wife in their care.

521
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:33,640
My wife was strangely silent during the drive,
and seemed very worried.

522
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:40,100
If I had not made a promise to the pub owner,
she would, I think, have asked me to stay

523
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,820
in Leatherhead that night.

524
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:48,800
Her face, I remember, was very white as I
drove away.

525
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,370
My feelings were quite different.

526
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:58,800
I had been very excited all day and I was
not sorry that I had to return to Maybury.

527
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,520
I was even afraid that the last shots I had
heard might mean the end of our visitors from

528
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,740
Mars.

529
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,920
I wanted to be there at the death.

530
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,890
The night was unexpectedly dark, and it was
as hot and airless as the day.

531
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:22,560
Overhead the clouds were passing fast, mixed
here and there with clouds of black and red

532
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,280
smoke, although no wind moved the bushes around
me.

533
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:34,370
I heard a church strike midnight, and then
I saw Maybury Hill, with its tree-tops and

534
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:38,370
roofs black and sharp against the red sky.

535
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:45,170
At that moment a bright green light lit up
the road around me and showed the distant

536
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,620
woods to the north.

537
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:56,010
I saw a line of green fire pass through the
moving clouds and into the field to my left.

538
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,280
It was the third cylinder!

539
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:06,030
Just after this came the first lightning of
the storm, and the thunder burst like a gun

540
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,730
overhead.

541
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:14,040
The horse ran forwards in terror at high speed.

542
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:19,200
There is a gentle slope towards the foot of
Maybury Hill, and down this we went.

543
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:26,360
After the lightning had begun, it flashed
again and again, as quickly as I have ever

544
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,930
seen.

545
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:32,840
The thunder crashed almost all the time.

546
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:39,790
The flashing light was blinding and confusing,
and thin rain hit my face as I drove down

547
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,130
the slope.

548
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:48,180
I paid little attention to the road in front
of me, and then suddenly my attention was

549
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,700
caught by something.

550
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:56,700
At first I thought it was the wet roof of
a house, but the lightning flashes showed

551
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,470
that it was moving quickly down Maybury Hill.

552
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:10,540
Then there was a great flash like daylight
and this strange object could be seen clearly.

553
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:15,470
How can I describe this Thing that I saw?

554
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:23,470
It was an enormous tripod, higher than many
houses, stepping over the young trees.

555
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:29,140
It was a walking engine of shining metal.

556
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:35,690
Then suddenly, the trees in the wood ahead
of me were pushed to the side and a second

557
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:41,950
enormous tripod appeared, rushing, as it seemed,
straight towards me.

558
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:46,630
And I was driving fast to meet it.

559
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:50,760
At the sight of this second machine I panicked
completely.

560
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,870
I pulled my horse's head hard round to the
right.

561
00:45:54,870 --> 00:46:00,920
The cart turned over on the horse and I was
thrown sideways.

562
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,160
I fell heavily into a shallow pool of water.

563
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:13,050
I crawled out almost immediately and lay,
my feet still in the water, under a bush.

564
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:20,040
The horse did not move (his neck was broken,
poor animal!) and by the lightning flashes

565
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:25,140
I saw the turned-over cart and one wheel still
spinning slowly.

566
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:32,660
Then the enormous machine walked past me and
went uphill.

567
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:38,420
As it passed it gave a deafening howl that
was louder than the thunder - 'Aloo!

568
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:47,680
Aloo!' - and a minute later it was with another
one, half a kilometer away, bending over something

569
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,980
in a field.

570
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:58,940
I have no doubt that this was the third of
the cylinders they had fired at us from Mars.

571
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,730
I was wet with rain above and pool-water below.

572
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:08,960
It was some time before my shock would let
me struggle up into a drier position, or think

573
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,260
of the great danger I was in.

574
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:19,180
I got to my feet at last and, keeping low,
managed to get into a wood near Maybury without

575
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,540
the machines seeing me.

576
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:28,040
Staying in the wood, I moved towards my own
house.

577
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,780
If I had really understood the meaning of
all the things I had seen, I would have gone

578
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,800
back to join my wife in Leatherhead immediately.

579
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:44,990
But that night it was all very strange and
I was physically exhausted, wet to the skin,

580
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:48,900
deafened and blinded by the storm.

581
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:54,300
All these things prevented me from making
a sensible decision.

582
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,120
I walked up the narrow road towards my house.

583
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:04,950
Near the top I stood on something soft and,
by a flash of lightning, saw the body of a

584
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,990
man.

585
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:13,111
I had never touched a dead body before, but
I forced myself to turn him over and feel

586
00:48:13,111 --> 00:48:15,540
for his heart.

587
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,490
He certainly was dead.

588
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:22,040
It seemed that his neck had been broken.

589
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,740
Then the lightning flashed again and I saw
his face.

590
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,350
It was the owner of the pub, whose cart I
had taken.

591
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:36,730
I stepped over him nervously and moved on
up the hill.

592
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:43,100
Towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and
the sound of feet, but I did not have the

593
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,920
courage to shout or go to them.

594
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:53,210
I let myself into my house and locked the
door, walked to the bottom of the stairs and

595
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:58,530
sat down, shaking violently.

596
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:04,330
It was some time before I could get to my
feet again and put on some dry clothes.

597
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:08,060
After that I went upstairs to my study.

598
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:13,850
The window looks over the trees and the railway
towards Horsell Common.

599
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,720
In the hurry to leave it had been left open.

600
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,660
I stopped in the doorway, at a safe distance
from it.

601
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,390
The thunderstorm had passed.

602
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:30,820
The towers of the Oriental College and the
trees around it had gone.

603
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:37,390
Very far away, lit by red fire, the common
was visible.

604
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:43,940
Across the light, great black shapes moved
busily backwards and forwards.

605
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:48,320
I closed the door noiselessly and moved nearer
the window.

606
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:56,450
The view opened out until, on one side, it
reached to the houses around Woking Station,

607
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:00,200
and on the other, to the burnt woods of Byfleet.

608
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:06,750
Between them were areas of fire and smoking
ground.

609
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:12,600
The view reminded me, more than anything else,
of factories at night.

610
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:19,680
I turned my desk chair to the window and stared
out at the country and, in particular, at

611
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:25,510
the three enormous black Things that were
moving around the common.

612
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:28,940
They seemed very busy.

613
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,340
I began to ask myself what they could be.

614
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,390
Were they intelligent machines?

615
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:39,290
I felt this was impossible.

616
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:45,510
Or did a Martian sit inside each, controlling
it in the same way that a man's brain controls

617
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:48,290
his body?

618
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:56,850
The storm had left the sky clear, and over
the smoke of the burning land the tiny bright

619
00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:04,460
light of Mars was dropping into the west,
when a soldier came quietly into my garden.

620
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,880
I got up and leant out of the window.

621
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,510
'Psst!'

622
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:12,570
I said, in a whisper.

623
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:16,770
He stopped for a moment, then walked across
to the house.

624
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:21,900
'Who's there?' he said, also whispering.

625
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,970
'Are you trying to hide?'

626
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:27,970
I asked.

627
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:28,970
'I am.'

628
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:32,790
'Come into the house,' I said.

629
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:37,160
I went down, opened the door and let him in.

630
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,310
I could not see his face.

631
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:42,250
He had no hat and his coat was unbuttoned.

632
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,830
'What's happened?'

633
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,410
I asked.

634
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:50,930
'We didn't have a chance.' he said.

635
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,300
'Not a chance.'

636
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,531
He followed me into the dining-room.

637
00:51:54,531 --> 00:52:00,760
'Have a drink,' I said, pouring one for him.

638
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,510
He drank it.

639
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:09,320
Then suddenly he sat down at the table, put
his head on his arms and began to cry like

640
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,380
a little boy.

641
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:17,730
It was a long time before he was able to answer
my questions, and the answers he gave were

642
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:22,010
puzzled and came in broken sentences.

643
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:25,170
He was part of a field-gun team.

644
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:31,640
They were turning their gun to fire on one
of the tripods when it suddenly exploded.

645
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,660
He found himself lying under a group of burnt
dead men and horses.

646
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:43,680
His back was hurt by the fall of a horse and
he lay there for a long time.

647
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,220
He watched as the foot-soldiers rushed towards
the tripod.

648
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,840
They all went down in a second.

649
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,740
Then the tripod walked slowly over the common.

650
00:52:54,740 --> 00:53:02,540
A kind of arm held a complicated metal case,
out of which the Heat-Ray flashed as it killed

651
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,980
anyone who was still moving.

652
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:12,810
Then the tripod turned and walked away towards
where the second cylinder lay.

653
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:20,410
At last the soldier was able to move, crawling
at first, and he got to Woking.

654
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:26,210
There were a few people still alive there;
most of them were very frightened, and many

655
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,940
of them had been burnt.

656
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:34,800
He hid behind a broken wall as one of the
Martian tripods returned.

657
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:40,710
He saw this one go after a man, catch him
in one of its steel arms and knock his head

658
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,130
against a tree.

659
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:50,790
After it got dark, the soldier finally ran
and managed to get across the railway.

660
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:54,830
That was the story I got from him, bit by
bit.

661
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,710
He grew calmer telling me.

662
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:03,330
He had eaten no food since midday, and I found
some meat and bread and brought it into the

663
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,360
room.

664
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,510
As we talked, the sky gradually became lighter.

665
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:18,260
I began to see his face, blackened and exhausted,
as no doubt mine was too.

666
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:24,110
When we had finished eating, we went quietly
upstairs to my study and I looked again out

667
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:25,810
of the open window.

668
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:31,040
In one night the valley had become a place
of death.

669
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:37,900
The fires had died down now, but the ruins
of broken and burnt-out houses and blackened

670
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:43,460
trees were clear in the cold light of the
dawn.

671
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:48,180
Destruction had never been so total in the
history of war.

672
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:55,660
And, shining in the morning light, three of
the tripods stood on the common, their tops

673
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:00,740
turning as they examined the damage they had
done.

674
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,740
CHAPTER SIX

675
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,030
The Death of Towns

676
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:12,790
As the dawn grew brighter, we moved back from
the window where we had watched and went very

677
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:15,800
quietly downstairs.

678
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:21,160
The soldier agreed with me that the house
was not a good place to stay in.

679
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:25,960
He suggested going towards London, where he
could rejoin his company.

680
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,040
My plan was to return at once to Leatherhead.

681
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:36,810
The strength of the Martians worried me so
much that I had decided to take my wife to

682
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:42,220
the south coast, and leave the country with
her immediately.

683
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:47,590
I had already decided that the area around
London would be the scene of a great battle

684
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:50,740
before the Martians could be destroyed.

685
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:58,210
Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the
third cylinder.

686
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:04,890
If I had been alone, I think I would have
taken my chance and gone straight across country.

687
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:08,340
But the soldier persuaded me not to.

688
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:14,410
'It's no kindness to your wife,' he said,
'for you to get killed.'

689
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:20,220
In the end I agreed to go north with him under
cover of the woods.

690
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:25,030
After that I would leave him and turn off
to reach Leatherhead.

691
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:30,810
I wanted to start at once, but the soldier
had been in wars before and knew better than

692
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:32,300
that.

693
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:39,250
He made me find all the food and drink that
we could carry, and we filled our pockets.

694
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:45,500
Then we left the house and ran as quickly
as we could down the narrow road.

695
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,560
All the houses seemed empty.

696
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:54,420
In the road lay a pile of three burnt bodies
close together, killed by the Heat-Ray.

697
00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:03,800
In fact, apart from ourselves, there did not
seem to be a living person on Maybury Hill.

698
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:10,080
We reached the woods at the foot of the hill
and moved through these towards the road.

699
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:16,310
As we ran, we heard the sound of horses and
saw through the trees three soldiers riding

700
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:18,810
towards Woking.

701
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:23,000
We shouted and they stopped while we hurried
towards them.

702
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,910
They were an officer and two men.

703
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:33,360
'You are the first people I've seen coming
this way this morning,' the officer said.

704
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,340
'What's happening?'

705
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,490
The soldier who had stayed with me stepped
up to him.

706
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:42,170
'My gun was destroyed last night, sir.

707
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:44,020
I've been hiding.

708
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:48,070
I'm trying to rejoin my company.

709
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:53,020
You'll come in sight of the Martians, I expect,
about a kilometer along this road.'

710
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:57,340
'What do they look like?' asked the officer.

711
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,580
'Big machines, sir.

712
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,820
Thirty metres high.

713
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:05,520
Three legs and a great big head, sir.'

714
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,810
'What nonsense!' said the officer.

715
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:11,400
'You'll see, sir.

716
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,180
They carry a kind of box that shoots fire
and strikes you dead.'

717
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:21,020
'What do you mean - a gun?'

718
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,640
'No, sir.'

719
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,430
And he began to describe the Heat-Ray.

720
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:31,240
Half-way through his report the officer interrupted
him and looked at me.

721
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:35,560
'Did you see it?' he said.

722
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,130
'It's perfectly true,' I replied.

723
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,590
'Well,' he said.

724
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:44,240
'I suppose it's my business to see it too.

725
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:50,800
Listen,' he said to my new friend, 'you'd
better go to Weybridge and report to the highest

726
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,220
officer.'

727
00:58:53,220 --> 00:59:00,400
He thanked me and they rode away.

728
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,270
By Byfleet station we came out from the trees
and found the country calm and peaceful in

729
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:08,870
the morning sunlight.

730
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:14,770
It seemed like any other Sunday - except for
the empty houses, and the other ones where

731
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:16,770
people were packing.

732
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:21,550
However, Byfleet was very busy.

733
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:27,800
Soldiers were telling people to leave and
helping them to load carts in the main street.

734
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:33,670
Many people, though, did not realize how serious
the situation was.

735
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:40,200
I saw one old man with a big box and a number
of flower-pots, angrily arguing with a soldier

736
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,680
who wanted him to leave them behind.

737
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,780
'Do you know what's over there?'

738
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:50,170
I said, pointing towards the woods that hid
the Martians.

739
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,750
'Eh?' he said.

740
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:56,820
'I was explaining that these are valuable.'

741
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:57,820
'Death!'

742
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:59,490
I shouted.

743
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:02,500
'Death is coming!

744
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:10,160
Death!' and leaving him to think about that,
I hurried on to Weybridge.

745
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,140
We remained there until midday, and at that
time found ourselves at the place where the

746
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:18,500
River Wey joins the River Thames.

747
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,840
Here we found an excited crowd of people.

748
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:26,480
There was no great fear at this time, but
already there were more people than all the

749
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,070
boats could carry across the Thames.

750
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:36,010
Every now and then people looked nervously
at the fields beyond Chertsey, but everything

751
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,790
there was still.

752
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:45,810
Then came the sound of a gun and, almost immediately,
other guns across the river, unseen because

753
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,920
of the trees, began to fire.

754
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:55,970
Everyone stood still, stopped by the sudden
sound of battle, near us but invisible to

755
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:56,970
us.

756
01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:02,170
Then we saw a cloud of smoke far away up the
river.

757
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:08,330
The ground moved and a heavy explosion shook
the air, smashing two or three windows in

758
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,820
the houses and leaving us shocked.

759
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,820
'Look!'

760
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:14,530
shouted a man.

761
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:16,390
'Over there!

762
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:19,330
Do you see them?'

763
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:29,250
Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three,
four of the Martian machines appeared, far

764
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:33,200
away over the low trees towards Chertsey.

765
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,720
Then, from a different direction, a fifth
one came towards us.

766
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:45,810
Their metal bodies shone in the sun as they
moved forwards to the guns.

767
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:52,070
One on the left, the furthest away, held a
large case high in the air, and the terrible

768
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:57,270
Heat-Ray shone towards Chertsey and struck
the town.

769
01:01:57,270 --> 01:02:05,400
At the sight of these strange, quick and terrible
creatures, the crowd near the water's edge

770
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,490
seemed for a moment to be totally shocked.

771
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:15,820
There was no screaming or shouting, but a
silence.

772
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:20,140
Then came some quiet talk and the beginning
of movement.

773
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:24,850
A woman pushed at me with her hand and rushed
past me.

774
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:29,150
I turned, but I was not too frightened for
thought.

775
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:31,530
'Get under water!'

776
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:35,690
I shouted, but nobody listened.

777
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:41,540
I turned around again and ran towards the
approaching Martian, ran right down the stony

778
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:45,370
beach and dived into the water.

779
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:46,660
Others did the same.

780
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:54,160
The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery,
and the river was so low that I moved perhaps

781
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,670
seven metres before I could get under the
surface.

782
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:02,250
I could hear people jumping off boats into
the water.

783
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:06,800
But the Martian took no notice of us.

784
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:11,950
When I lifted my head it was looking towards
the guns that were still firing across the

785
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,490
river.

786
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:19,330
It was already raising the case which sent
the Heat-Ray when the first shell burst six

787
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:22,010
metres above its head.

788
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:24,890
I gave a cry of surprise.

789
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:30,120
Then two other shells burst at the same time
in the air near its body.

790
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:37,730
Its head twisted round in time to receive,
but not in time to avoid, the fourth shell.

791
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:41,230
This exploded right in its face.

792
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:47,890
Its head flashed and burst into a dozen broken
pieces of red flesh and shining metal.

793
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,220
'Hit!'

794
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:51,880
I shouted.

795
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:56,440
The headless machine marched on, swinging
from side to side.

796
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:04,720
It hit a church tower, knocking it down, then
moved on and fell into the river out of sight.

797
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:13,580
A violent explosion shook the air, and a column
of water, steam, mud and broken metal shot

798
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:17,630
far up into the sky.

799
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:24,440
In another moment a great wave of very hot
water came sweeping round the bend.

800
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:30,680
I saw people struggling towards the shore
and heard their screaming and shouting faintly

801
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,780
above the noise of the Martian's fall.

802
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:39,490
I rushed through the water until I could see
round the bend.

803
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:46,650
The Martian came into sight down the river,
most of it under the water.

804
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:52,460
Thick clouds of steam were pouring from the
wreckage, and through it I could see its long

805
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:57,150
legs and tentacles moving in the water.

806
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:00,250
My attention was caught by an angry noise.

807
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:07,360
A man, knee-deep in the water, shouted to
me and pointed, although I could not hear

808
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,050
what he said.

809
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:15,370
Looking back, I saw the other Martians walking
down the river-bank from the direction of

810
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,370
Chertsey.

811
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:22,870
The guns fired again, but with no effect.

812
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:28,900
At that moment I got under the water and,
holding my breath until movement was painful,

813
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,700
swam under the surface for as long as I could.

814
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:39,690
The river was rough around me and quickly
growing hotter.

815
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:45,750
When for a moment I raised my head to breathe
and throw the hair and water out of my eyes,

816
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:52,240
the steam was rising in a white fog that hid
the Martians completely.

817
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,610
The noise was deafening.

818
01:05:54,610 --> 01:06:00,660
Then I saw them, enormous grey figures.

819
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:04,920
They had passed me and two were bending over
the fallen one.

820
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:09,470
The third and fourth stood beside him in the
water.

821
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:16,020
The cases that produced the Heat-Rays were
waved high and the beams flashed this way

822
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:17,830
and that.

823
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:25,060
The air was full of deafening and confusing
noises: the loud sounds of the Martians, the

824
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:33,390
crash of falling houses, the flash of fire
as trees and fences began to burn.

825
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:39,660
Thick black smoke was rising to mix with the
steam from the river.

826
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:45,330
Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray
came towards me.

827
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:48,720
The houses fell as it touched them, and exploded
into flame.

828
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:54,510
The trees caught fire with a loud noise.

829
01:06:54,510 --> 01:07:00,150
The Heat- Ray came down to the water's edge
less than fifty metres from where I stood.

830
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:06,280
It ran across the river and the water behind
it boiled.

831
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,450
I turned towards the shore.

832
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:15,360
In another moment a large wave of almost boiling
water rushed towards me.

833
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,930
I screamed and ran.

834
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:23,590
If my foot had slipped, it would have been
the end.

835
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:28,040
I fell in full view of the Martians on the
stony beach.

836
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:34,000
I expected only death.

837
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,610
I have a faknee-int memory of the foot of
a Martian coming down within twenty metres

838
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:43,440
of my head, going straight into the loose
stones.

839
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:49,360
Then I saw the four of them carrying the remains
of the fallen one between them, now clear

840
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:55,670
and then later faint through a curtain of
smoke, moving away from me across a great

841
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:59,360
space of river and fields.

842
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,150
And then, very slowly.

843
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:10,170
I realized that somehow I had escaped.

844
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:16,809
I saw an empty boat, very small and far away,
moving down the river and, taking off most

845
01:08:16,809 --> 01:08:19,839
of my wet clothes, I swam to it.

846
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:27,000
I used my hands to keep it moving, down the
river towards Walton, going very slowly and

847
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,839
often looking behind me.

848
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:35,549
I was in some pain and very tired.

849
01:08:35,549 --> 01:08:40,880
When the bridge at Walton was coming into
sight, I landed on the Middlesex bank and

850
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,819
lay down, very sick, in the long grass.

851
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:51,920
I do not remember the arrival of the curate,
so probably I slept for some time.

852
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:59,420
As I woke up, I noticed a seated figure with
his face staring at the sky, watching the

853
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,250
sunset.

854
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:06,500
I sat up, and at the sound of my movement
he looked at me.

855
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,540
'Have you any water?'

856
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,159
I asked.

857
01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:12,159
He shook his head.

858
01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:19,449
'You have been asking for water for the last
hour,' he said.

859
01:09:19,449 --> 01:09:23,569
For a moment we were silent, staring at each
other.

860
01:09:23,569 --> 01:09:27,039
He spoke suddenly, looking away from me.

861
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:30,940
'What does it mean? he said.

862
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:36,380
'What do these things mean?'

863
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,880
I gave no answer.

864
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,909
'Why are these things allowed?

865
01:09:40,909 --> 01:09:46,659
What have we done - what has Weybridge done?

866
01:09:46,659 --> 01:09:50,029
The morning service was over.

867
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:57,750
I was walking the roads to clear my brain,
and then - fire and death!

868
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:05,019
All our work - everything destroyed.

869
01:10:05,019 --> 01:10:06,019
The church!

870
01:10:06,019 --> 01:10:10,679
We rebuilt it only three years ago.

871
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:12,659
Gone!

872
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:14,639
Why?'

873
01:10:14,639 --> 01:10:25,270
Another pause, and then he shouted, 'The smoke
of her burning goes up for ever and ever!'

874
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:31,820
His eyes were wide and he pointed a thin finger
in the direction of Weybridge.

875
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:36,550
It was clear to me that the great tragedy
in which he was involved - it seemed that

876
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:42,050
he had escaped from Weybridge - had driven
him to the edge of madness.

877
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:45,679
'Are we far from Sunbury?'

878
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,960
I said, very quietly.

879
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,619
'What can we do?' he asked.

880
01:10:51,619 --> 01:10:53,179
'Are these creatures everywhere?

881
01:10:53,179 --> 01:10:57,870
Has the Earth been given to them?'

882
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:01,329
'Are we far from Sunbury?'

883
01:11:01,329 --> 01:11:06,010
'Only this morning I was in charge of the
church service -'

884
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:09,070
'Things have changed!'

885
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:10,789
I said, quietly.

886
01:11:10,789 --> 01:11:12,820
'You must stay calm.

887
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:15,550
There is still hope.'

888
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:16,889
'Hope!'

889
01:11:16,889 --> 01:11:23,120
'Yes, a lot of hope, despite all this destruction.

890
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,039
Listen!'

891
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:30,340
From beyond the low hills across the water
came the dull sound of the distant guns and

892
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:35,239
a far-away strange crying.

893
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:37,969
Then everything was still.

894
01:11:37,969 --> 01:11:43,960
High in the west the moon hung pale above
the smoke and the hot, still beauty of the

895
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,350
sunset.

896
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:49,219
'We had better follow this path,' I said.

897
01:11:49,219 --> 01:11:53,400
'To the north.'

898
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,440
CHAPTER SEVEN

899
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,280
In London

900
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,550
My younger brother was in London when the
Martians fell at Woking.

901
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:09,739
He was a medical student, working for an examination,
and he heard nothing of the arrival until

902
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:11,960
Saturday morning.

903
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:18,400
The morning papers on Saturday contained,
in addition to a great deal of information

904
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:24,369
about the planet Mars, one very short report.

905
01:12:24,369 --> 01:12:29,900
The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a
crowd, had killed a number of people with

906
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:34,090
a quick-firing gun, the story said.

907
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:39,820
It ended with the words, 'Although they seem
frightening, the Martians have not moved from

908
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:46,880
the pit into which they have fallen, and don't
seem able to do so.'

909
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,820
Even the afternoon papers had nothing to tell
apart from the movement of soldiers around

910
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:57,670
the common, and the burning of the woods between
Woking and Weybridge.

911
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:02,230
Nothing more of the fighting was known that
night, the night of my drive to Leatherhead

912
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:04,989
and back.

913
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:10,659
My brother was not worried about us, as he
knew from the description in the papers chat

914
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:15,530
the cylinder was three kilometres from my
house.

915
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:21,210
That night he made up his mind to visit me,
in order to see the Things before they were

916
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:23,250
killed.

917
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:27,889
He sent a telegram, which never reached me.

918
01:13:27,889 --> 01:13:33,920
On the Saturday evening, at Waterloo station,
he learned that an accident prevented trains

919
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,530
from reaching Woking.

920
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:40,110
He could not discover what kind of accident
it was.

921
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:47,400
In fact, the people in charge of the railway
did not clearly know at that time.

922
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:51,060
There was very little excitement at the station.

923
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:56,239
Few people connected the problem with the
Martians.

924
01:13:56,239 --> 01:14:02,150
I have read, in another description of these
events, that on Sunday morning 'all London

925
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:05,179
was panicked by the news from Woking.'

926
01:14:05,179 --> 01:14:09,510
In fact, this is simply not true.

927
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:14,610
Plenty of Londoners did not hear of the Martians
until Monday morning.

928
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:20,010
Some did, but they needed time to realize
what all the reports in the Sunday papers

929
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:21,410
actually meant.

930
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:26,230
But most people in London do not read Sunday
papers.

931
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:34,769
Besides this, Londoners are very used to feeling
safe, and exciting news is so normal in the

932
01:14:34,769 --> 01:14:41,480
papers that they could read reports like this
without great fear:

933
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:47,849
At about seven o'clock last night the Martians
came out of the cylinder and, moving around

934
01:14:47,849 --> 01:14:55,829
in metal machines, completely destroyed Woking
station and the houses around it, and killed

935
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:58,300
around 600 soldiers.

936
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:01,340
No details are known.

937
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:08,090
Machine guns are completely useless against
them, and field-guns have been put out of

938
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:09,920
action.

939
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:14,579
The Martians appear to be moving towards Chertsey.

940
01:15:14,579 --> 01:15:20,699
People in West Surrey are very worried and
defenses have been built to slow the Martians'

941
01:15:20,699 --> 01:15:25,250
movement towards London.

942
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:30,789
No one in London knew what the Martians looked
like, and there was still a fixed idea that

943
01:15:30,789 --> 01:15:39,139
they must be slow: 'crawling', 'moving painfully'
- words like these were in all the earlier

944
01:15:39,139 --> 01:15:40,190
reports.

945
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:46,079
But none of them were written by anyone who
had actually seen a Martian.

946
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:53,000
The Sunday papers printed separate editions
as further news came in.

947
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,220
But there was almost nothing to tell people
until the government announced that the people

948
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:10,710
of Walton and Weybridge, and all chat district,
were pouring along the roads towards London.

949
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:16,829
My brother went again to Waterloo station
to find out if the line to Woking was open.

950
01:16:16,829 --> 01:16:22,780
There he heard that the Chertsey line was
also closed.

951
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:28,420
He learned that several unusual telegrams
had been received in the morning from Byfleet

952
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:35,219
and Chertsey stations, but that these had
suddenly stopped.

953
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:39,510
My brother could get very little exact information
out of them.

954
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:47,179
'There's fighting going on around Weybridge,'
was all the information they had.

955
01:16:47,179 --> 01:16:52,039
Quite a number of people who had been expecting
friends to arrive by train were standing at

956
01:16:52,039 --> 01:16:54,239
the station.

957
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,519
One man spoke to my brother.

958
01:16:56,519 --> 01:17:04,320
'There are lots of people coming into Kingston
in carts and things, with boxes and cases,'

959
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,320
he said.

960
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:11,840
'They come from Weybridge and Walton, and
they said guns have been heard at Chertsey,

961
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:18,769
heavy firing, and that soldiers told them
to move out at once because the Martians are

962
01:17:18,769 --> 01:17:19,769
corning.

963
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:21,570
What does it all mean?

964
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:26,330
The Martians can't get out of their pit, can
they?'

965
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:30,059
My brother could not tell him.

966
01:17:30,059 --> 01:17:35,860
At about five o'clock the growing crowd in
the station was greatly excited by the opening

967
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:43,800
of the line between the South-Eastern and
South-Western stations, which is usually closed.

968
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:50,030
Then trains carrying large guns and many soldiers
passed through the station, moving towards

969
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:52,230
Kingston.

970
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:58,480
Soon after that the police arrived and began
to move the crowd out of the station, and

971
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:03,949
my brother went out into the street again.

972
01:18:03,949 --> 01:18:09,530
On Waterloo Bridge a number of people were
watching an odd brown liquid that came down

973
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:11,579
the river from time to time.

974
01:18:11,579 --> 01:18:19,020
The sun was just setting and the Houses of
Parliament stood against a peaceful sky.

975
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:23,179
There was talk of a floating body.

976
01:18:23,179 --> 01:18:29,850
In Wellington Street my brother met two men
selling newspapers which had just been printed.

977
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:34,139
The advertising boards said, 'Terrible tragedy!

978
01:18:34,139 --> 01:18:35,449
Fighting at Weybridge!

979
01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:37,900
Defeat of the Martians!

980
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:41,280
London in danger!'

981
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,239
He bought a paper.

982
01:18:43,239 --> 01:18:52,420
Then, and only then, he understood something
of the full power and terror of the Martians.

983
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:58,949
He learned that they were not just a few small
crawling creatures, but that they could control

984
01:18:58,949 --> 01:19:02,530
enormous mechanical bodies.

985
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:08,940
They could move quickly and strike with such
power that even the biggest guns could not

986
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:11,610
stand against them.

987
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:19,270
They were described as, 'great machines like
spiders, nearly thirty metres high, as fast

988
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:26,369
as an express train, and able to shoot out
a beam of strong heat.'

989
01:19:26,369 --> 01:19:32,280
Many field-guns, the report said, had been
hidden around the country near Horsell Common,

990
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:37,079
and especially between the Woking district
and London.

991
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:43,710
Five of the machines had been seen moving
towards the Thames and one, by a lucky chance,

992
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:45,430
had been destroyed.

993
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:52,480
In other cases the shells had missed, and
the guns had at once been destroyed by the

994
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,310
Heat-Rays.

995
01:19:54,310 --> 01:20:01,690
Heavy losses of soldiers were mentioned, but
in general the report was optimistic.

996
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:05,449
The Martians had been defeated, my brother
read.

997
01:20:05,449 --> 01:20:09,960
They had gone back to their cylinders again,
in the circle around Woking.

998
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:16,650
Guns, including some very large ones, were
moving in quickly.

999
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:21,829
One hundred and sixteen were now in position,
mainly covering London.

1000
01:20:21,829 --> 01:20:28,719
There had never been such a large or fast
movement of war equipment in England before.

1001
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:36,659
No doubt, said the report, the situation was
strange and serious, but the public was asked

1002
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:40,300
to avoid and discourage panic.

1003
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:45,010
No doubt the Martians were very frightening,
but there could not be more than twenty of

1004
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:49,670
them against our millions.

1005
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:53,999
All down Wellington Street people could be
seen reading the paper.

1006
01:20:53,999 --> 01:20:58,849
Men came running from buses to get copies.

1007
01:20:58,849 --> 01:21:03,510
Certainly people were excited by the news,
whatever they had felt before.

1008
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:08,699
A map shop in the Strand opened specially,
and a man in his

1009
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:17,380
Sunday clothes could be seen inside quickly
fixing maps of Surrey to the shop window.

1010
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:25,249
Going along the Strand to Trafalgar Square,
my brother saw some of the refugees from West

1011
01:21:25,249 --> 01:21:27,219
Surrey.

1012
01:21:27,219 --> 01:21:32,900
There was a man with his wife and two boys
and some pieces of furniture in a cart, and

1013
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:38,540
close behind him came another one with five
or six well-dressed people and some boxes

1014
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:40,079
and cases.

1015
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:45,590
The faces of the people showed that they were
very tired.

1016
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:50,360
Some distance behind them was a man on an
old-fashioned bicycle.

1017
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:54,230
He was dirty and white-faced.

1018
01:21:54,230 --> 01:22:00,389
My brother turned towards Victoria station,
and met a number of people like these.

1019
01:22:00,389 --> 01:22:03,659
He had an idea that he might see me.

1020
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:08,420
He noticed an unusual number of police controlling
the traffic.

1021
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:13,480
Some of the refugees were exchanging news
with the people on the buses.

1022
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:17,579
Most were excited by their strange experience.

1023
01:22:17,579 --> 01:22:23,769
My brother spoke to several of the refugees
but none could give him any news of Woking,

1024
01:22:23,769 --> 01:22:29,300
except one man who said that it had been totally
destroyed the previous night.

1025
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:34,409
At that time there was a strong feeling on
the streets that the government should be

1026
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:40,369
blamed because they had not destroyed the
Martians already.

1027
01:22:40,369 --> 01:22:44,989
At about eight o'clock the sound of tiring
could be heard clearly ail over the south

1028
01:22:44,989 --> 01:22:47,020
of London.

1029
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:51,769
My brother walked from Westminster to his
room near Regent's Park.

1030
01:22:51,769 --> 01:22:56,230
He was now very worried about me.

1031
01:22:56,230 --> 01:23:01,369
There were one or two carts with refugees
going along Oxford Street, but the news was

1032
01:23:01,369 --> 01:23:07,150
spreading so slowly that Regent Street and
Portland Place were full of people taking

1033
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:11,690
their usual Sunday night walk.

1034
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:16,449
Along the edge of Regent's Park there were
as many romantic couples as there had ever

1035
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:17,860
been.

1036
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:20,360
The night was warm and still.

1037
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:26,860
The sound of guns continued from time to time
and after midnight there seemed to be lightning

1038
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:29,480
in the south.

1039
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:36,300
My brother read and reread the paper, thinking
that the worst had happened to me.

1040
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:41,300
He was restless, and after supper went out
again.

1041
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:48,630
He returned and tried to concentrate on his
examination notes, but without success.

1042
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:53,869
He went to bed a little after midnight and
was woken in the early hours of Monday morning

1043
01:23:53,869 --> 01:24:00,870
by the sound of knocking on doors, feet running
in the street, distant drumming and the ringing

1044
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:03,090
of bells.

1045
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:06,360
For a moment he lay in surprise.

1046
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:11,400
Then he jumped out of bed and ran to the window.

1047
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:16,530
Up and down the street other windows were
opening and people were shouting questions.

1048
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:19,020
'They are coming!'

1049
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:22,860
a policeman shouted back, banging on the door.

1050
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:26,769
'The Martians are coming!'

1051
01:24:26,769 --> 01:24:29,340
Then he hurried to the next door.

1052
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:35,469
The sound of drums came from the army base
in Albany Street and bells were ringing in

1053
01:24:35,469 --> 01:24:37,679
every church.

1054
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:43,309
There was a noise of doors opening, and the
lights went on in window after window in the

1055
01:24:43,309 --> 01:24:45,449
houses across the street.

1056
01:24:45,449 --> 01:24:51,510
A closed carriage came up the street, quickly
followed by a number of other fast-moving

1057
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:52,739
vehicles.

1058
01:24:52,739 --> 01:25:00,860
Most of them were going to Chalk Farm station,
where special trains were being loaded.

1059
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:07,409
For a long time my brother stared out of the
window in total surprise, watching the policeman

1060
01:25:07,409 --> 01:25:10,960
banging at door after door.

1061
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:16,349
Then he crossed the room and began to dress,
running with each piece of clothing to the

1062
01:25:16,349 --> 01:25:20,510
window in order to miss nothing of the growing
excitement.

1063
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:28,369
And then men selling unusually early newspapers
came shouting into the street:

1064
01:25:28,369 --> 01:25:30,889
'London in danger!

1065
01:25:30,889 --> 01:25:34,030
Kingston and Richmond defenses broken!

1066
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:38,769
Terrible killing in the Thames Valley!'

1067
01:25:38,769 --> 01:25:44,940
All around him - in the rooms below, in the
houses on each side and across the road, and

1068
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:51,130
all across London - people were rubbing their
eyes and opening windows to stare out and

1069
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:57,249
ask questions, and getting dressed quickly
as the first breath of the coming storm of

1070
01:25:57,249 --> 01:26:01,159
fear blew through the streets.

1071
01:26:01,159 --> 01:26:04,949
It was the beginning of the great panic.

1072
01:26:04,949 --> 01:26:12,429
London, which had gone to bed on Sunday night
not knowing much and caring even less, was

1073
01:26:12,429 --> 01:26:20,489
woken in the early hours of Monday morning
to a real sense of danger.

1074
01:26:20,489 --> 01:26:25,710
Unable to learn what was happening from his
window, my brother went down and out into

1075
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:31,219
the street, just as the sky turned pink with
the dawn.

1076
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:35,970
Every moment brought more and more fast-moving
people in vehicles.

1077
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:40,480
'Black Smoke!' he heard people shouting.

1078
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,690
'Black Smoke!'

1079
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:49,300
As he stood at the door, not knowing what
to do, he saw another newspaper-seller approaching

1080
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:50,300
him.

1081
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:56,219
The man was running away with the others and
selling his papers for many times their normal

1082
01:26:56,219 --> 01:27:03,400
price as he ran - a strange mixture of profit
and panic.

1083
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:10,510
And from this paper my brother read that terrible
report from the commander of the army:

1084
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:14,719
The Martians are able to send out enormous
clouds of black smoke.

1085
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:22,150
They have poisoned our gunners, destroyed
Richmond, Kingston and Wimbledon, and are

1086
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:30,960
moving slowly towards London, destroying everything
on the way, It is impossible to stop them.

1087
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:38,550
There is no safety from the Black Smoke except
by running away.

1088
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:41,829
That was all, but it was enough.

1089
01:27:41,829 --> 01:27:49,030
All of the six million people who lived in
the great city were beginning to move.

1090
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:52,630
Soon everybody would be trying to escape to
the north.

1091
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:54,699
'Black Smoke!'

1092
01:27:54,699 --> 01:27:57,150
the voices shouted.

1093
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:58,310
'Fire!'

1094
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:04,909
The bells of the local church rang loudly,
a carelessly-driven cart smashed, and people

1095
01:28:04,909 --> 01:28:07,310
screamed and swore.

1096
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:11,040
Yellow lights moved around in the houses.

1097
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:19,000
And in the sky above them, the dawn was growing
brighter - clear and calm.

1098
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,639
He heard people running in the rooms, and
up and down the stairs behind him.

1099
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:26,110
His neighbour came to the door.

1100
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:33,199
She was not properly dressed and her husband
followed her, shouting.

1101
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:39,139
As my brother began to realize how serious
the situation was, he returned quickly to

1102
01:28:39,139 --> 01:28:45,890
his room, put all the money he had - about
ten pounds - into his pockets and went out

1103
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:48,030
again into the streets.

1104
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:50,530
CHAPTER EIGHT

1105
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:54,249
The Black Smoke

1106
01:28:54,249 --> 01:29:00,469
While the curate had sat and talked so wildly
to me in the flat fields near Walton, and

1107
01:29:00,469 --> 01:29:06,559
while my brother was watching the refugees
pour across Westminster Bridge, the Martians

1108
01:29:06,559 --> 01:29:09,840
had started to attack again.

1109
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:15,999
As it was reported later, most of them remained
busy with preparations in the pit on Horsell

1110
01:29:15,999 --> 01:29:23,449
Common until nine that night, doing something
that produced a great amount of Black Smoke.

1111
01:29:23,449 --> 01:29:28,969
But three certainly came out at about eight
o'clock.

1112
01:29:28,969 --> 01:29:35,889
They moved forwards slowly and carefully towards
Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight

1113
01:29:35,889 --> 01:29:39,010
of the waiting guns.

1114
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:44,520
These Martians moved in a line, perhaps two
kilometres apart.

1115
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:49,550
They communicated with each other by loud
howls.

1116
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:54,699
It was this howling and the firing of the
guns at Ripley and Weybridge that we heard

1117
01:29:54,699 --> 01:29:57,199
at Walton.

1118
01:29:57,199 --> 01:30:00,929
The Ripley gunners had never been in action
before.

1119
01:30:00,929 --> 01:30:08,210
The guns fired one ineffective shell each,
then the soldiers ran away.

1120
01:30:08,210 --> 01:30:15,650
The Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked
calmly over their guns.

1121
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:21,340
The Weybridge men, however, were better led
or were more experienced.

1122
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:27,260
Hidden by a wood, it seems they were not noticed
by the Martian nearest to them.

1123
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:33,159
They aimed their guns well and fired at a
distance of about one kilometer.

1124
01:30:33,159 --> 01:30:40,260
The shells exploded all round it and it was
seen to move forwards a few steps, and go

1125
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:41,260
down.

1126
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:44,329
The guns were reloaded quickly.

1127
01:30:44,329 --> 01:30:52,199
The fallen Martian used its voice, and immediately
a second one answered it, appearing over the

1128
01:30:52,199 --> 01:30:54,960
trees to the south.

1129
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,580
It seemed that one of its three legs had been
broken.

1130
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:04,469
All of the second shells missed the Martian
on the ground and, immediately.

1131
01:31:04,469 --> 01:31:07,840
The other Martians used their Heat-Rays on
the guns.

1132
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:16,219
The shells blew up, the trees all around the
guns caught fire and only one or two of the

1133
01:31:16,219 --> 01:31:19,940
men escaped.

1134
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:25,159
After this it seemed that the three Martians
spoke together, and those who were watching

1135
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:31,269
them report that they stayed absolutely quiet
for the next half-hour.

1136
01:31:31,269 --> 01:31:38,710
The fallen Martian crawled slowly out of its
machine and began to repair its leg.

1137
01:31:38,710 --> 01:31:44,610
By about nine it had finished, and the machine
was seen to move again.

1138
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:52,579
A few minutes later these three were joined
by four other Martians, each carrying a thick

1139
01:31:52,579 --> 01:31:53,730
black tube.

1140
01:31:53,730 --> 01:32:00,770
A similar tube was given to each of the three,
and the seven spread out at equal distances

1141
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:05,420
along a curved line between Weybridge and
Ripley.

1142
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:12,690
A dozen signal lights went on as soon as they
began to move, warning the waiting guns around

1143
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:13,980
Esher.

1144
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:21,769
At the same time four of the fighting-machines,
also carrying tubes, crossed the river, and

1145
01:32:21,769 --> 01:32:28,349
two of them, black against the western sky,
came into sight of myself and the curate as

1146
01:32:28,349 --> 01:32:33,309
we hurried along the road to the north.

1147
01:32:33,309 --> 01:32:39,760
When he saw them, the curate made a frightened
noise and began running, but I knew it was

1148
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:46,670
no good running from a Martian and I crawled
into some bushes by the side of the road.

1149
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:51,249
He looked back and turned to join me.

1150
01:32:51,249 --> 01:32:57,230
We heard the distant sound of a gun, then
another nearer, and then another.

1151
01:32:57,230 --> 01:33:03,650
And then the Martian closest to us raised
his tube and fired it towards the guns, with

1152
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:08,230
a loud bang that made the ground shake.

1153
01:33:08,230 --> 01:33:10,140
The other one did the same.

1154
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:18,519
There was no flash, no smoke, simply a loud
noise.

1155
01:33:18,519 --> 01:33:24,840
I was so excited by all this that I completely
forgot about my persona safety and raised

1156
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,920
my head out of the bushes.

1157
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:34,650
As I did, I heard another bang and something
flew fast over my head.

1158
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:41,489
I expected at least to see smoke or fire,
but there was only the deep-blue sky above

1159
01:33:41,489 --> 01:33:44,300
and one single star.

1160
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:50,900
There had been no explosion, no answer from
the guns.

1161
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:54,570
Silence returned, and three minutes passed.

1162
01:33:54,570 --> 01:33:59,469
'What's happened?' said the curate, standing
up.

1163
01:33:59,469 --> 01:34:04,020
'I've no idea,' I answered.

1164
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:10,969
I looked again at the Martian, and saw that
it was now moving east along the river bank.

1165
01:34:10,969 --> 01:34:17,610
Every moment I expected a hidden gun to fire
at it, but the evening calm was unbroken.

1166
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:23,769
The figure of the Martian grew smaller as
it moved away, and soon it was hidden by the

1167
01:34:23,769 --> 01:34:27,159
mist and the coming night.

1168
01:34:27,159 --> 01:34:31,679
The curate and I climbed higher up the hill
and looked around.

1169
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:39,160
Towards Sunbury there was something dark,
like a hill, hiding our view of the country

1170
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,110
further away.

1171
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:47,810
Then, far across the river, we saw another,
similar hill.

1172
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:52,179
These hills grew lower and broader as we stared.

1173
01:34:52,179 --> 01:34:59,829
I had a sudden thought and looked to the north,
and there I saw a third of these cloudy black

1174
01:34:59,829 --> 01:35:02,960
hills.

1175
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:06,590
Everything had become very still.

1176
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:12,730
Far away to the north-east we heard the Martians
calling to each other, but our guns were silent.

1177
01:35:12,730 --> 01:35:21,539
At the time we could not understand these
things, but later I learnt the meaning of

1178
01:35:21,539 --> 01:35:24,909
these frightening black hills.

1179
01:35:24,909 --> 01:35:30,179
Each of the Martians, standing in the great
curve I have described, had used the tube

1180
01:35:30,179 --> 01:35:38,269
he carried to fire a large cylinder over whatever
hill, wood or other possible hiding-place

1181
01:35:38,269 --> 01:35:42,050
for guns might be in front of him.

1182
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:46,960
Some fired only one of these, some two or
more.

1183
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:52,969
These broke when they hit the ground - they
did not explode - and let out an enormous

1184
01:35:52,969 --> 01:35:56,770
amount of thick Black Smoke.

1185
01:35:56,770 --> 01:36:03,679
This rose up in a cloud shaped like a hill,
then sank and spread itself slowly over the

1186
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:06,750
surrounding country.

1187
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:09,940
And it was death to breathe that smoke.

1188
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:17,271
It was heavy, this smoke, so when it began
to sink down it behaved like a liquid, running

1189
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:21,050
down hills and into the valleys.

1190
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:28,749
And where it met with water, or even mist
or wet grass, a chemical action took place

1191
01:36:28,749 --> 01:36:37,500
and it turned into a powder that sank slowly
and made room for more.

1192
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:43,790
When the smoke had begun to settle, it stayed
quite close to the ground so that even fifteen

1193
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:50,469
metres up in the air, on the roots and upper
floors of houses and in high trees, there

1194
01:36:50,469 --> 01:36:53,710
was a chance of escaping its poison.

1195
01:36:53,710 --> 01:37:01,489
A man later told me that he had watched from
a church roof as the smoke filled his village.

1196
01:37:01,489 --> 01:37:08,290
For a day and a half he stayed up there, tired,
hungry and burnt by the sun before it was

1197
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:09,999
safe to come down.

1198
01:37:09,999 --> 01:37:15,429
But that was in a village where the Black
Smoke was allowed to remain until it sank

1199
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:17,230
into the ground.

1200
01:37:17,230 --> 01:37:25,199
Usually, when it had done its work, the Martian
cleared the air by blowing steam at it.

1201
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:30,170
They did this to the black clouds near us,
as we saw in the starlight from the upper

1202
01:37:30,170 --> 01:37:33,099
window of an empty house.

1203
01:37:33,099 --> 01:37:38,050
From there we could see the searchlights on
Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill moving in

1204
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:46,210
the sky, and at about eleven the windows shook,
and we heard the sound of the large guns that

1205
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:49,619
had been put in position there.

1206
01:37:49,619 --> 01:37:55,420
These continued for a quarter of an hour,
firing blindly at Martians too far away to

1207
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:56,420
be seen.

1208
01:37:56,420 --> 01:38:04,639
Then the fourth cylinder fell - a bright green
star to the north-east.

1209
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:13,030
So, doing it methodically, as a man might
kill insects, the Martians spread this strange

1210
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:17,570
killing smoke over the country towards London.

1211
01:38:17,570 --> 01:38:23,679
The ends of the curve slowly moved apart,
until at least they formed a line about twelve

1212
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:25,989
kilometres long.

1213
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:30,989
All through the night their tubes moved forwards.

1214
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:36,199
They never gave the guns any chance against
them.

1215
01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:41,449
Wherever there was a possibility of guns being
hidden, they fired a cylinder of Black Smoke

1216
01:38:41,449 --> 01:38:47,119
at them, and where the guns could be seen
they used the Heat-Ray.

1217
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:54,780
By midnight the burning trees along the slopes
of Richmond Hill lit up clouds of Black Smoke

1218
01:38:54,780 --> 01:39:01,760
which covered the whole valley of the Thames,
and went as far as the eye could see.

1219
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:07,370
They only used the Heat-Ray from time to time
that night, either because they had a limited

1220
01:39:07,370 --> 01:39:13,280
supply of material for its production or because
they did not want to destroy the country,

1221
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,429
but only to defeat its people.

1222
01:39:17,429 --> 01:39:20,440
They certainly succeeded.

1223
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:25,190
Sunday night was the end of organized opposition
to their movement.

1224
01:39:25,190 --> 01:39:30,969
After that no group of men would stand against
them, because this would mean almost certain

1225
01:39:30,969 --> 01:39:32,369
death.

1226
01:39:32,369 --> 01:39:39,469
You have to imagine what happened to the gunners
towards Esher, waiting so tensely in the evening

1227
01:39:39,469 --> 01:39:44,389
light, because none of them lived to tell
the story.

1228
01:39:44,389 --> 01:39:51,890
You can see the quiet expectation, the officers
watching, the gunners waiting with their horses,

1229
01:39:51,890 --> 01:39:58,050
the groups of local people standing as near
as they were allowed, the ambulances and hospital

1230
01:39:58,050 --> 01:40:02,900
tents with the burnt and wounded from Weybridge.

1231
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:08,019
Then came the dull noise of the shots that
the Martians fired, and the cylinder flying

1232
01:40:08,019 --> 01:40:14,659
over the trees and houses and breaking in
the neighboring fields.

1233
01:40:14,659 --> 01:40:18,909
You can imagine, too, how they watched as
the blackness rose into the sky.

1234
01:40:18,909 --> 01:40:24,739
The men and horses near it were seen running,
screaming, falling down.

1235
01:40:24,739 --> 01:40:31,619
There were shouts of fear, the guns suddenly
left behind, men on the ground struggling

1236
01:40:31,619 --> 01:40:39,400
to breathe, and the fast spreading of the
dark smoke - a silent black cloud hiding its

1237
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,110
dead.

1238
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:46,730
Before dawn the Black Smoke was pouring through
the streets of Richmond.

1239
01:40:46,730 --> 01:40:51,989
The government, already falling apart, made
one last effort.

1240
01:40:51,989 --> 01:40:56,510
It told the people of London that they had
to run away.

1241
01:40:56,510 --> 01:40:57,510
CHAPTER NINE

1242
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:01,739
Escape

1243
01:41:01,739 --> 01:41:06,499
You can understand the wave of fear that swept
through the greatest city in the world at

1244
01:41:06,499 --> 01:41:09,769
dawn on Monday morning.

1245
01:41:09,769 --> 01:41:15,739
People ran to the railway stations, to the
boats on the Thames, and hurried by even street

1246
01:41:15,739 --> 01:41:19,739
that went north or east.

1247
01:41:19,739 --> 01:41:24,780
By ten o'clock the police were finding it
hard to keep control.

1248
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:30,690
All the railway lines north of the Thames
had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and

1249
01:41:30,690 --> 01:41:33,960
trains were being filled.

1250
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:38,249
Passengers were fighting for standing room
in the carriages even at two o'clock in the

1251
01:41:38,249 --> 01:41:40,639
morning.

1252
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:46,190
By three the crowds were so large around the
stations that people were being pushed over

1253
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:48,650
and walked on.

1254
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:51,769
Guns were fired and knives were used.

1255
01:41:51,769 --> 01:41:57,969
The police who had been sent to direct the
traffic, exhausted and angry, were fighting

1256
01:41:57,969 --> 01:42:03,229
with the people they had been called out to
protect.

1257
01:42:03,229 --> 01:42:09,820
And as time passed and the engine drivers
and firemen refused to return to London, the

1258
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:16,400
people turned in growing crowds away from
the stations and onto the roads running north.

1259
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:23,900
By midday a cloud of slowly sinking Black
Smoke had moved along the Thames, cutting

1260
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:27,699
off all escape across the bridges.

1261
01:42:27,699 --> 01:42:33,710
Another cloud came over Ealing, and surrounded
a little island of people on Castle Hill,

1262
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:40,010
alive but unable to escape.

1263
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:45,309
After trying unsuccessfully to get onto a
train at Chalk Farm my brother came out into

1264
01:42:45,309 --> 01:42:50,989
the road, pushed through the hurrying lines
of vehicles, and had the luck to be at the

1265
01:42:50,989 --> 01:42:55,480
front of a crowd which was taking bicycles
from a shop.

1266
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:57,940
He got his hands on one.

1267
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:02,469
He put a hole in its front tire while he was
pulling it through the broken window, and

1268
01:43:02,469 --> 01:43:05,280
cut his wrist, but he managed to get away
on it.

1269
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:12,619
The foot of Haverstock Hill was blocked by
fallen horses, but my brother got onto the

1270
01:43:12,619 --> 01:43:14,300
Belsize Road.

1271
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:21,360
So he escaped from the worst of the panic
in London and reached Edgware at about seven.

1272
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:27,460
A kilometer before the village the front wheel
of the bicycle broke.

1273
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:31,770
He left it at the roadside and walked on.

1274
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:36,409
People there were standing on the pavement,
looking in surprise at the growing crowds

1275
01:43:36,409 --> 01:43:38,019
of refugees.

1276
01:43:38,019 --> 01:43:44,230
He succeeded in getting some food at a pub.

1277
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:49,420
My brother had some friends in Chelmsford,
and this perhaps made him take the road that

1278
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:51,119
ran to the east.

1279
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:58,630
He saw few other refugees until he met the
two ladies who later travelled with him.

1280
01:43:58,630 --> 01:44:03,369
He arrived just in time to save them.

1281
01:44:03,369 --> 01:44:09,199
He heard their screams and, hurrying round
the corner, saw a couple of men trying to

1282
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:14,440
pull them out of the little cart which they
had been driving, while a third held onto

1283
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:17,760
the frightened horse's head.

1284
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:23,120
One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in
white, was screaming.

1285
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:29,199
The other, younger one was hitting the man
who held her arm with a whip.

1286
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:33,050
My brother shouted and ran towards them.

1287
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:36,590
One of the men turned towards him.

1288
01:44:36,590 --> 01:44:42,630
Realizing from his face that a fight was unavoidable,
and being a good boxer, my brother hit him

1289
01:44:42,630 --> 01:44:47,979
hard and knocked him back onto the wheel of
the cart.

1290
01:44:47,979 --> 01:44:55,059
It was no time for fair fighting, and my brother
quieted him with a kick, then took hold of

1291
01:44:55,059 --> 01:44:59,590
the collar of the man who held the younger
lady's arm.

1292
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:05,150
He heard the horse move forwards and then
the third man hit him between the eyes.

1293
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:11,550
The man he held pulled himself free and ran
off down the road in the direction from which

1294
01:45:11,550 --> 01:45:14,090
he had come.

1295
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:19,550
Still recovering, my brother found himself
facing the man who had held the horse's head,

1296
01:45:19,550 --> 01:45:23,260
and realized that the cart was moving away
along the road.

1297
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:30,550
The man, who looked very well built, tried
to move in closer, but my brother hit him

1298
01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:32,349
in the face.

1299
01:45:32,349 --> 01:45:38,690
Then, realizing that he was alone, he ran
along the road after the cart, with the big

1300
01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:40,190
man behind him.

1301
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:48,219
The man who had run away had now stopped and
turned and was following my brother at a greater

1302
01:45:48,219 --> 01:45:49,389
distance.

1303
01:45:49,389 --> 01:45:51,960
Suddenly, my brother fell.

1304
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:58,599
The big man tripped over him, and when my
brother got to his feet he found himself facing

1305
01:45:58,599 --> 01:46:00,889
both of them.

1306
01:46:00,889 --> 01:46:05,979
He would have had very little chance if the
younger lady had not very bravely stopped

1307
01:46:05,979 --> 01:46:10,530
the cart and returned to help him.

1308
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:16,389
It seemed that she had had a gun all the time,
but it had been under her seat when they were

1309
01:46:16,389 --> 01:46:18,030
attacked.

1310
01:46:18,030 --> 01:46:22,760
She fired from six metres away, narrowly missing
my brother.

1311
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:31,090
The less brave of the two attackers ran away,
and the other one followed cursing him.

1312
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:35,469
They both stopped further down the road, where
the third man lay unconscious.

1313
01:46:35,469 --> 01:46:37,989
'Take this!'

1314
01:46:37,989 --> 01:46:41,710
the younger lady said, and she gave my brother
the gun.

1315
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:49,280
'Let's go back to the cart,' said my brother,
wiping the blood from his lip.

1316
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:54,320
They walked to where the lady in white was
struggling to hold the frightened horse.

1317
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:57,150
My brother looked back along the road.

1318
01:46:57,150 --> 01:47:00,400
The robbers had had enough and were moving
away.

1319
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:09,989
'I'll sit here,' he said, 'if I may,' and
he got up on the front seat.

1320
01:47:09,989 --> 01:47:17,139
The younger lady sat beside him and made the
horse move.

1321
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:21,780
My brother learned that the two women were
the wife and younger sister of a doctor living

1322
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:27,520
in Stanmore, The doctor had heard about the
Martians at the railway station, on his way

1323
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:33,880
home from seeing a patient, and had sent them
off, promising to follow after telling the

1324
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:35,020
neighbour.

1325
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:39,829
He said he would catch up with them by about
half-past four in the morning, but it was

1326
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:45,159
now nearly nine and there was no sign of him.

1327
01:47:45,159 --> 01:47:50,499
They stopped and waited for a few hours, but
the doctor did not appear.

1328
01:47:50,499 --> 01:47:56,030
The younger woman suggested that they should
move on and catch a train at St Albans.

1329
01:47:56,030 --> 01:48:02,849
My brother, who had seen the situation at
the stations in London, thought that was hopeless.

1330
01:48:02,849 --> 01:48:08,239
He suggested that they should drive across
Essex to the sea at Harwich, and from there

1331
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:12,599
get right out of the country.

1332
01:48:12,599 --> 01:48:17,849
Mrs Elphinstone - that was the name of the
woman in white - refused to listen to his

1333
01:48:17,849 --> 01:48:24,519
argument, and kept calling for 'George', but
her sister-in-law was very quiet and sensible

1334
01:48:24,519 --> 01:48:28,130
and agreed to my brother's suggestion.

1335
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:35,460
So, intending to cross the Great North Road,
they went on towards Barnet.

1336
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:41,030
As they got closer they saw- more and more
people, all tired and dirty.

1337
01:48:41,030 --> 01:48:48,389
They also noticed a long line of dust rising
among the houses in front of them.

1338
01:48:48,389 --> 01:48:54,469
There was a sharp bend in the road, less than
fifty metres from the crossroads.

1339
01:48:54,469 --> 01:48:57,949
When they came out of it Mrs Elphinstone said.

1340
01:48:57,949 --> 01:48:59,699
'Good heavens!

1341
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:03,469
What is this you are driving us into'"

1342
01:49:03,469 --> 01:49:06,219
My brother stopped the horse.

1343
01:49:06,219 --> 01:49:14,670
The main road was a boiling stream of people,
a river of human beings rushing to the north.

1344
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:21,179
A great cloud of dust, white under the strong
sun, made everything within five metres of

1345
01:49:21,179 --> 01:49:24,050
the ground grey and unclear.

1346
01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:31,440
More dust was raised all the time by the thick
crowd of men and women, horses and vehicles.

1347
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,570
'Go on!

1348
01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:34,880
Go on!'

1349
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,639
the voices said.

1350
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:38,780
'They're coming.'

1351
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:44,179
It seemed that the whole population of London
was moving north.

1352
01:49:44,179 --> 01:49:50,550
There were people of every class and profession,
but they were all dusty; their skins were

1353
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:58,670
dry, their lips black and cracked, and all
of them looked very afraid.

1354
01:49:58,670 --> 01:50:01,679
My brother saw Miss Elphinstone covering her
eyes.

1355
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:04,770
'Let's go back!' he shouted.

1356
01:50:04,770 --> 01:50:07,440
'We cannot cross this.'

1357
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:13,059
They went back a hundred metres in the direction
they had come.

1358
01:50:13,059 --> 01:50:18,630
As they passed the bend in the road, my brother
saw a man lying not far away.

1359
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:21,300
His face was white and shining.

1360
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:25,079
It was clear that he was near death.

1361
01:50:25,079 --> 01:50:29,630
The two women sat in silence.

1362
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:32,729
Beyond the bend my brother changed his mind.

1363
01:50:32,729 --> 01:50:34,550
He turned to Miss Elphinstone.

1364
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:42,309
'We must go that way,' he said, and turned
the horse round again.

1365
01:50:42,309 --> 01:50:47,030
For the second time that day the girl showed
her courage.

1366
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:52,590
My brother went into the crowd and stopped
a horse pulling a cart, while she drove in

1367
01:50:52,590 --> 01:50:54,610
front of it.

1368
01:50:54,610 --> 01:51:00,820
In another moment they were caught and swept
forwards with the stream of vehicles.

1369
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:06,860
My brother, with red whip-marks on his face
and hands from the car's driver, got up into

1370
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:08,869
the driving seat.

1371
01:51:08,869 --> 01:51:16,360
'Point the gun at the man behind,' he said,
giving it to her, 'it he pushes us too hard.

1372
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:20,670
No - point it at his horse.'

1373
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:25,300
Then they began to look for a chance of getting
to the right side of the road.

1374
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:30,780
But as soon as they were in the stream of
vehicles, there was little they could do.

1375
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:35,719
They were taken through Barnet and were more
than a kilometer beyond the centre of the

1376
01:51:35,719 --> 01:51:40,699
town before they could fight their way across
to the other side of the road.

1377
01:51:40,699 --> 01:51:45,699
They turned to the east and climbed a hill.

1378
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:52,010
There they stopped for the rest of the afternoon,
because they were all exhausted.

1379
01:51:52,010 --> 01:51:58,179
They were beginning to feel very hungry and
the night was cold.

1380
01:51:58,179 --> 01:52:03,820
In the evening many people came hurrying along
the road near their stopping-place, escaping

1381
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:09,880
from unknown dangers and going in the direction
from which my brother had come.

1382
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:10,880
CHAPTER TEN

1383
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,810
The Thunder Child

1384
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:20,739
If the Martians had only wanted destruction,
they could have killed the whole population

1385
01:52:20,739 --> 01:52:26,570
of London on Monday, as it moved out slowly
through the neighboring countryside.

1386
01:52:26,570 --> 01:52:33,030
It one had flown over London that morning,
every road to the north or east would have

1387
01:52:33,030 --> 01:52:41,239
seemed black with moving refugees, everyone
a frightened and exhausted human being.

1388
01:52:41,239 --> 01:52:50,709
None of the wars of history had such an effect
- six million people, moving without weapons

1389
01:52:50,709 --> 01:52:56,219
or food or any real sense of direction.

1390
01:52:56,219 --> 01:53:00,860
It was the start of the death of the human
race.

1391
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:08,530
And over the blue hills to the south of the
river, the Martians moved backwards and forwards,

1392
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:16,329
calmly spreading their poison clouds over
one piece of country and then over another.

1393
01:53:16,329 --> 01:53:23,030
They destroyed any weapons they found and
wrecked the railways here and there.

1394
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:30,619
They seemed in no hurry, and did not go beyond
the central part of London all that day.

1395
01:53:30,619 --> 01:53:35,979
It is possible that many people stayed in
their houses through Monday morning.

1396
01:53:35,979 --> 01:53:43,329
It is certain that many died at home, killed
by the Black Smoke.

1397
01:53:43,329 --> 01:53:49,239
Until about midday there were still many ships
on the Thames, attracted by the enormous sums

1398
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:52,710
of money offered by refugees.

1399
01:53:52,710 --> 01:53:58,039
It is said that many who swam out to these
ships were pushed away and drowned.

1400
01:53:58,039 --> 01:54:05,280
At about one o'clock in the afternoon, the
thin remains of a cloud of Black Smoke was

1401
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:08,739
seen coming through London's Blackfriars Bridge.

1402
01:54:08,739 --> 01:54:17,070
This caused a terrible panic and all the ships
and boats tried to leave at the same time.

1403
01:54:17,070 --> 01:54:22,739
Many became stuck together under Tower Bridge,
and the sailors had to fight against people

1404
01:54:22,739 --> 01:54:26,929
who tried to get on from the riverside.

1405
01:54:26,929 --> 01:54:31,239
People were actually climbing down onto the
boats from the bridge above.

1406
01:54:31,239 --> 01:54:39,030
When, an hour later, a Martian walked down
the river, there was nothing but broken pieces

1407
01:54:39,030 --> 01:54:42,989
of boats in the water.

1408
01:54:42,989 --> 01:54:47,260
I will tell you later about the falling of
the fifth cylinder.

1409
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:51,150
The sixth one fell in Wimbledon.

1410
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:56,540
My brother, watching beside the women in the
cart in the field, saw the green flash of

1411
01:54:56,540 --> 01:54:59,579
it far beyond the hills.

1412
01:54:59,579 --> 01:55:05,039
On Tuesday the three of them, still intending
to get out to sea, drove through the busy

1413
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:08,809
country towards Colchester.

1414
01:55:08,809 --> 01:55:13,230
That day the refugees began to realize how
much they needed food.

1415
01:55:13,230 --> 01:55:18,170
As they grew hungry, they began to steal.

1416
01:55:18,170 --> 01:55:22,860
Farmers defended their animals and crops with
guns in their hands.

1417
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:28,960
A number of people now, like my brother, were
moving to the east, and some were even so

1418
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:34,219
desperate that they turned back towards London
to get food.

1419
01:55:34,219 --> 01:55:39,570
These were mainly people from the northern
suburbs who had only heard of, but not seen,

1420
01:55:39,570 --> 01:55:43,500
the Black Smoke.

1421
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:47,940
My brother heard that about half the members
of the government had met in Birmingham, in

1422
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:53,610
central England, and that enormous amounts
of explosive were being prepared to be used

1423
01:55:53,610 --> 01:55:56,179
in the Midlands.

1424
01:55:56,179 --> 01:56:01,289
He was told that the Midland Railway Company
had started running trains again, and was

1425
01:56:01,289 --> 01:56:05,139
taking people north from St Albans.

1426
01:56:05,139 --> 01:56:10,369
There was also a notice which said that within
twenty-four hours bread would be given to

1427
01:56:10,369 --> 01:56:12,179
the hungry people.

1428
01:56:12,179 --> 01:56:19,280
But this did not change their plans, and they
continued travelling east.

1429
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:26,630
They heard no more about the bread than this
notice, and nobody else did either.

1430
01:56:26,630 --> 01:56:35,909
That night the seventh cylinder fell in London,
on Primrose Hill.

1431
01:56:35,909 --> 01:56:41,499
On Wednesday my brother and the two women
reached Chelmsford, and there a number of

1432
01:56:41,499 --> 01:56:49,330
people, calling themselves the Council of
Public Safety, took their horse for food.

1433
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:55,840
Although the three of them were hungry themselves,
they decided to walk on.

1434
01:56:55,840 --> 01:57:02,070
After several more hours on the road, they
suddenly saw the sea and the most amazing

1435
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:09,060
crowd of ships of all types that it is possible
to imagine.

1436
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:13,519
After the sailors could no longer come up
the Thames, they went to the towns on the

1437
01:57:13,519 --> 01:57:16,989
Essex coast to take people onto their ships.

1438
01:57:16,989 --> 01:57:23,820
Close to the shore was a large number of fishing-boats
from various countries, and steamboats from

1439
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:26,190
the Thames.

1440
01:57:26,190 --> 01:57:32,860
Beyond these were the larger ships - a great
number of coal ships, ships carrying goods,

1441
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:38,229
and neat white and grey passenger ships from
Southampton and Hamburg.

1442
01:57:38,229 --> 01:57:43,150
About three kilometres out there was a warship.

1443
01:57:43,150 --> 01:57:50,349
This was the Thunder Child, the only one in
sight, but far away to the right a column

1444
01:57:50,349 --> 01:57:55,070
of smoke marked the position of other warships.

1445
01:57:55,070 --> 01:58:01,499
These waited in a long line, ready for action,
right across the mouth of the Thames, watching

1446
01:58:01,499 --> 01:58:07,320
the Martian attack but powerless to prevent
it.

1447
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:11,719
At the sight of the sea Mrs Elphmstone panicked.

1448
01:58:11,719 --> 01:58:16,840
She had never been out of England before;
she would rather die than be friendless in

1449
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:19,530
a foreign country.

1450
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:25,949
She had been growing increasingly upset and
depressed during the two days' journey.

1451
01:58:25,949 --> 01:58:30,920
Her great idea was to return to Stanmore.

1452
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:33,280
Things had always been safe in Stanmore.

1453
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:38,079
They would find George in Stanmore.

1454
01:58:38,079 --> 01:58:43,520
It was very difficult to get her down to the
beach, where after some time my brother caught

1455
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:48,110
the attention of some men from a steamboat.

1456
01:58:48,110 --> 01:58:54,789
They sent a small boat and agreed on a price
of thirty-six pounds for the three passengers.

1457
01:58:54,789 --> 01:59:02,730
The steamboat was going, these men said, to
the Belgian port of Ostend.

1458
01:59:02,730 --> 01:59:07,640
It was about two o'clock when my brother got
onto it with the two women.

1459
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:12,929
There was food available, although the prices
were very high, and the three of them had

1460
01:59:12,929 --> 01:59:14,070
a meal.

1461
01:59:14,070 --> 01:59:20,329
There were already around forty passengers
on the boat, some of whom had spent their

1462
01:59:20,329 --> 01:59:27,130
last money getting a ticket, but the captain
stayed until five in the afternoon, picking

1463
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:31,920
up passengers until the boat was dangerously
crowded.

1464
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:37,139
He would probably have stayed longer it the
sound or guns had not begun at about that

1465
01:59:37,139 --> 01:59:38,550
time in the south.

1466
01:59:38,550 --> 01:59:47,219
The Thunder Child, too, fired a small gun
and sent up a string of flags.

1467
01:59:47,219 --> 01:59:50,469
Some smoke rose as its engines started.

1468
01:59:50,469 --> 01:59:59,389
At the same time, far away in the south-east,
the shapes of three warships appeared, beneath

1469
01:59:59,389 --> 02:00:01,699
clouds of smoke.

1470
02:00:01,699 --> 02:00:07,559
The little steamboat was already moving out
to sea, when a Martian appeared, small and

1471
02:00:07,559 --> 02:00:11,949
far away, moving along the muddy coast from
the south.

1472
02:00:11,949 --> 02:00:22,659
The captain swore at the top of his voice
at his own delay, and the ship increased speed.

1473
02:00:22,659 --> 02:00:29,239
It was the first Martian that my brother had
seen, and he stood, more amazed than frightened,

1474
02:00:29,239 --> 02:00:36,730
as it moved steadily towards the ships, walking
further and further into the water.

1475
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:44,670
Then, far away, another appeared, stepping
over some small trees, and then another could

1476
02:00:44,670 --> 02:00:53,510
be seen even further away, crossing the flat
mud that lay between the sea and the sky.

1477
02:00:53,510 --> 02:00:58,760
Looking to the north-east, my brother saw
the long line of ships already moving away

1478
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:01,639
from the approaching terror.

1479
02:01:01,639 --> 02:01:06,850
One ship was passing behind another; many
were turning.

1480
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:13,159
Steamships whistled and sent up clouds of
steam, sails were let out and small boats

1481
02:01:13,159 --> 02:01:16,820
rushed here and there.

1482
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:21,789
He was so interested in this that he did not
look out to sea.

1483
02:01:21,789 --> 02:01:27,499
And then a quick movement of the steamboat
(which had turned to avoid being hit) threw

1484
02:01:27,499 --> 02:01:30,880
him off the seat on which he had been standing.

1485
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,820
There was shouting all around him.

1486
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:38,340
a movement of feet and a cheer that seemed
to be answered.

1487
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:44,709
He got to his feet and saw to the right, less
than a hundred metres away, the warship cutting

1488
02:01:44,709 --> 02:01:51,389
through the water at full speed, throwing
enormous waves out on either side.

1489
02:01:51,389 --> 02:01:56,199
Some water came over the side of the steamboat
and blinded my brother for a moment.

1490
02:01:56,199 --> 02:02:05,190
When his eyes were clear again, the warship
had passed and was rushing towards the land.

1491
02:02:05,190 --> 02:02:10,659
He looked past it at the Martians again and
saw the three of them now close together,

1492
02:02:10,659 --> 02:02:18,719
and standing so far out to sea that their
legs were almost completely under water.

1493
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:23,210
It seemed to him that they were surprised
by this new enemy.

1494
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:27,981
To their minds, perhaps, no other machine
could be as large as themselves.

1495
02:02:27,981 --> 02:02:37,459
The Thunder Child fired no gun, but simply
sailed at full speed towards them.

1496
02:02:37,459 --> 02:02:43,350
Probably because it did not fire, it managed
to get quite close.

1497
02:02:43,350 --> 02:02:45,499
They did not know what it was.

1498
02:02:45,499 --> 02:02:51,449
If the ship had fired one shell, they would
have sent it straight to the bottom with the

1499
02:02:51,449 --> 02:02:52,969
Heat-Ray.

1500
02:02:52,969 --> 02:03:01,190
Suddenly, the nearest Martian lowered his
tube and fired a cylinder at the Thunder Child.

1501
02:03:01,190 --> 02:03:06,199
This hit its left side and sent up a black
cloud that the ship moved away from.

1502
02:03:06,199 --> 02:03:14,639
To the watchers on the steamboat, low in the
water and with the sun in their eyes, it seemed

1503
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:18,590
that the warship was already among the Martians.

1504
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:25,780
They saw the three thin figures separating
and rising out of the water as they moved

1505
02:03:25,780 --> 02:03:32,800
back towards the shore, and one of them raised
the box that fired his Heat-Ray.

1506
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:39,599
He held it pointing down, and a cloud of steam
came up from the water as it hit the ship.

1507
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:46,320
A flame rose up through the steam and then
the Martian began to fall over.

1508
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:53,550
In another moment it had hit the sea, and
a great amount of water and steam flew high

1509
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:54,719
in the air.

1510
02:03:54,719 --> 02:04:02,420
The guns of the Thunder Child were heard going
off one after another, and one shot hit the

1511
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:05,880
water close by the steamboat.

1512
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:10,340
No one worried about that very much.

1513
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:15,999
As the Martian fell, the captain shouted and
all the crowded passengers at the back of

1514
02:04:15,999 --> 02:04:18,619
the steamer joined in.

1515
02:04:18,619 --> 02:04:21,640
And then he shouted again.

1516
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:28,300
Because rushing out beyond the smoke and steam
came something long and black with flames

1517
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:31,030
coming from it.

1518
02:04:31,030 --> 02:04:34,980
The warship could stilt turn and its engines
worked.

1519
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:40,380
It went straight towards a second Martian,
and was within a hundred metres of it when

1520
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:42,349
the Heat-Rav hit it.

1521
02:04:42,349 --> 02:04:49,280
There was a violent bang, a blinding flash
and the warship blew up.

1522
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:55,869
The Martian was thrown back by the violence
of the explosion, and in another moment the

1523
02:04:55,869 --> 02:05:01,900
burning wreckage, still moving forwards, had
broken the Martian like something made of

1524
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:03,739
wood.

1525
02:05:03,739 --> 02:05:04,969
My brother shouted.

1526
02:05:04,969 --> 02:05:10,400
A boiling cloud of steam hid everything again.

1527
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:11,980
'Two!'

1528
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:14,920
shouted the captain.

1529
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:19,719
Everyone was shouting and they could hear
shouts and cheers from the other ships and

1530
02:05:19,719 --> 02:05:20,989
the boats.

1531
02:05:20,989 --> 02:05:28,889
The steam stayed in the air for many minutes,
hiding the third Martian and the coast.

1532
02:05:28,889 --> 02:05:35,481
All this time the steamboat was moving steadily
out to sea and away from the fight, and when

1533
02:05:35,481 --> 02:05:41,400
at last the steam cleared, the black cloud
got in the way and they could see nothing

1534
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:45,939
of either the Thunder Child or the third Martian.

1535
02:05:45,939 --> 02:05:57,010
But the other warships were now quite close
and moving in towards the shore.

1536
02:05:57,010 --> 02:06:02,110
The little ship my brother was on continued
to move out to sea, and the warships became

1537
02:06:02,110 --> 02:06:04,909
smaller in the distance.

1538
02:06:04,909 --> 02:06:12,010
Then suddenly, out of the golden sunset, came
the sound of guns and the sight of black shadows

1539
02:06:12,010 --> 02:06:14,199
moving.

1540
02:06:14,199 --> 02:06:19,360
Everyone moved to the side of the steamboat
and looked to the west, but smoke rose and

1541
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:21,929
blocked the sun.

1542
02:06:21,929 --> 02:06:22,979
Nothing could be seen clearly.

1543
02:06:22,979 --> 02:06:30,440
The ship travelled on while the passengers
wondered.

1544
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:37,949
The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky darkened
and an evening star came into sight.

1545
02:06:37,949 --> 02:06:43,010
Then the captain cried out and pointed.

1546
02:06:43,010 --> 02:06:50,849
Something rushed up into the sky, something
flat and broad and very large, and flew in

1547
02:06:50,849 --> 02:06:53,340
a great curve.

1548
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:59,999
It grew smaller, sank slowly and disappeared
again into the night.

1549
02:06:59,999 --> 02:07:05,889
And as it flew, it rained down darkness on
the land.

1550
02:07:05,889 --> 02:07:06,889
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1551
02:07:06,889 --> 02:07:11,749
Earth Under the Martians

1552
02:07:11,749 --> 02:07:17,229
In the last two chapters I have moved away
from my own adventures to tell of the experiences

1553
02:07:17,229 --> 02:07:19,729
of my brother.

1554
02:07:19,729 --> 02:07:25,179
All through this time I and the curate had
been hiding in the empty house where we went

1555
02:07:25,179 --> 02:07:28,469
to escape the Black Smoke.

1556
02:07:28,469 --> 02:07:34,869
We stayed there all Sunday night and all the
next day - the day of the panic - in a little

1557
02:07:34,869 --> 02:07:41,329
island of daylight, cut off by the Black Smoke
from the rest of the world.

1558
02:07:41,329 --> 02:07:47,040
We could only wait and be bored during those
two days.

1559
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:50,209
I was very worried about my wife.

1560
02:07:50,209 --> 02:07:56,610
I thought of her in Leatherhead, frightened,
in danger, thinking of me already as a dead

1561
02:07:56,610 --> 02:07:58,800
man.

1562
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:04,650
I knew my cousin was brave enough for any
emergency, but he was not the sort of man

1563
02:08:04,650 --> 02:08:10,079
to understand danger quickly and do something
about it.

1564
02:08:10,079 --> 02:08:17,769
These worries stayed on my mind and I grew
very tired of the curate's constant talking.

1565
02:08:17,769 --> 02:08:24,409
After trying and failing to keep him quiet,
I kept away from him in other rooms in the

1566
02:08:24,409 --> 02:08:27,380
house.

1567
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:32,079
We were surrounded by the Black Smoke all
that day and the following morning.

1568
02:08:32,079 --> 02:08:38,599
There were signs of people in the next house
on Sunday evening - a face at a window and

1569
02:08:38,599 --> 02:08:42,630
moving lights, and later the closing of a
door.

1570
02:08:42,630 --> 02:08:48,519
But I do not know who these people were or
what happened to them.

1571
02:08:48,519 --> 02:08:50,369
We saw nothing of them the next day.

1572
02:08:50,369 --> 02:08:57,689
The Black Smoke moved slowly towards the river
all through Monday morning, slowly getting

1573
02:08:57,689 --> 02:09:05,780
nearer and nearer to us, coming at last along
the road outside the house that hid us.

1574
02:09:05,780 --> 02:09:12,749
A Martian walked across the fields at about
midday, killing the stuff with steam.

1575
02:09:12,749 --> 02:09:19,400
When we looked out I saw the country covered
with black dust, but we were no longer trapped.

1576
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:25,679
As soon as I saw that escape was possible,
my dream of action returned.

1577
02:09:25,679 --> 02:09:29,280
But the curate did not want to leave.

1578
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:36,650
'We are safe here - safe here,' he repeated.

1579
02:09:36,650 --> 02:09:38,769
I decided to leave him.

1580
02:09:38,769 --> 02:09:44,829
The soldier had taught me well and I looked
for food and drink and a spare shirt to take

1581
02:09:44,829 --> 02:09:47,099
with me.

1582
02:09:47,099 --> 02:09:55,510
When it was clear to the curate that I intended
to go alone, he suddenly decided to come.

1583
02:09:55,510 --> 02:10:00,630
Everything was quiet through the afternoon
and we started at about five o'clock along

1584
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:02,780
the blackened road to Sunbury.

1585
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:10,849
Here and there along the road, and in Sunbury
itself, were dead bodies of horses as well

1586
02:10:10,849 --> 02:10:19,329
as men, turned-over carts and luggage, all
covered thickly with black dust.

1587
02:10:19,329 --> 02:10:26,689
As we passed other small towns, we found them
unaffected by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke,

1588
02:10:26,689 --> 02:10:30,949
and there were some people alive, although
none could give us news.

1589
02:10:30,949 --> 02:10:35,939
Here too, there were signs of quick departure.

1590
02:10:35,939 --> 02:10:44,079
I remember a pile of three broken bicycles,
flattened by the wheels of passing carts.

1591
02:10:44,079 --> 02:10:48,309
We crossed Richmond Bridge at about half-past
eight.

1592
02:10:48,309 --> 02:10:53,571
Once again, on the Surrey side, there was
black dust that had once been smoke, and some

1593
02:10:53,571 --> 02:10:58,969
dead bodies - a number of them near the approach
to the station.

1594
02:10:58,969 --> 02:11:04,190
Then suddenly, as we walked north, we saw
some people running.

1595
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:09,989
The top of a Martian fighting-machine came
into sight over the house tops, less than

1596
02:11:09,989 --> 02:11:13,239
a hundred metres away from us.

1597
02:11:13,239 --> 02:11:19,380
We stood shocked by our danger, and if the
Martian had been looking down we would have

1598
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:22,510
died immediately.

1599
02:11:22,510 --> 02:11:27,059
We were too frightened to go on and hid in
a hut in a garden.

1600
02:11:27,059 --> 02:11:34,599
There the curate lay down, crying silently
and refusing to move again.

1601
02:11:34,599 --> 02:11:41,400
But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead
would not let me rest, and in the evening

1602
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:43,639
I went out again.

1603
02:11:43,639 --> 02:11:52,400
I left the curate in the hut, but he came
hurrying after me.

1604
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:58,070
That second start was the most foolish thing
I ever did.

1605
02:11:58,070 --> 02:12:01,570
It was obvious that the Martians were all
around us.

1606
02:12:01,570 --> 02:12:07,309
As soon as the curate caught up with me, we
saw either the fighting-machine we had seen

1607
02:12:07,309 --> 02:12:12,039
before or another one, far away across the
fields.

1608
02:12:12,039 --> 02:12:19,650
Four or five little black figures hurried
in front of it, and in a moment it became

1609
02:12:19,650 --> 02:12:24,170
obvious that this Martian was hunting them.

1610
02:12:24,170 --> 02:12:30,749
In three steps it was among them, and they
ran away in all directions.

1611
02:12:30,749 --> 02:12:36,860
It did not use its Heat-Ray, but picked them
up one by one and threw them into a large

1612
02:12:36,860 --> 02:12:41,199
metal box which stuck out behind it.

1613
02:12:41,199 --> 02:12:47,869
For the first time, I realized that perhaps
the Martians had another purpose, apart from

1614
02:12:47,869 --> 02:12:51,290
destroying human beings.

1615
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:57,209
We stood for a moment in terror, then ran
through a gate behind us into a garden and

1616
02:12:57,209 --> 02:13:01,139
hid in a corner until the stars were out.

1617
02:13:01,139 --> 02:13:07,110
It was nearly eleven o'clock before we felt
brave enough to go out again.

1618
02:13:07,110 --> 02:13:15,079
We kept away from the road, moving through
gardens and some areas full of trees.

1619
02:13:15,079 --> 02:13:21,110
When we got to Sheen, the curate said that
he felt unwell and we decided to try one of

1620
02:13:21,110 --> 02:13:22,749
the houses.

1621
02:13:22,749 --> 02:13:29,280
The one we chose was in a walled garden, and
in the kitchen we found some food.

1622
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:36,510
There were two loaves of bread, a raw steak
and some cooked meat.

1623
02:13:36,510 --> 02:13:41,959
Under a shelf we found some bottled beer,
and there were two bags of green beans and

1624
02:13:41,959 --> 02:13:43,039
some lettuce.

1625
02:13:43,039 --> 02:13:49,369
In a cupboard there was some tinned soup and
fish and two tins of cake.

1626
02:13:49,369 --> 02:13:57,989
I am listing these exactly because we lived
on this food for the next fortnight.

1627
02:13:57,989 --> 02:14:04,289
We sat in the kitchen in the dark and had
a meal of cold food, and just before midnight

1628
02:14:04,289 --> 02:14:10,650
there was a blinding flash of green light
followed by the loudest bang I have ever heard.

1629
02:14:10,650 --> 02:14:18,510
There was a crash of glass, the sound of falling
walls, and then the ceiling fell down in pieces

1630
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:20,920
on our heads.

1631
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:25,939
I was knocked across the floor and my head
hit the oven.

1632
02:14:25,939 --> 02:14:32,059
I lay there unconscious for a long time, the
curate told me, and when I woke up he was

1633
02:14:32,059 --> 02:14:36,310
wiping my face with a wet handkerchief.

1634
02:14:36,310 --> 02:14:39,719
For some time I could not remember what had
happened.

1635
02:14:39,719 --> 02:14:44,030
'Are you better?' he asked.

1636
02:14:44,030 --> 02:14:47,079
At last I answered him.

1637
02:14:47,079 --> 02:14:48,699
I sat up.

1638
02:14:48,699 --> 02:14:51,460
'Don't move,' he said.

1639
02:14:51,460 --> 02:14:54,929
'The floor is covered with broken plates.

1640
02:14:54,929 --> 02:15:04,540
You can't possibly move without making a noise,
and I think they are outside.'

1641
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:13,849
We both sat in complete silence, so we could
hardly hear each other breathing.

1642
02:15:13,849 --> 02:15:19,860
Outside and very near was the noise from a
machine, which started and stopped.

1643
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:22,439
'What is it?'

1644
02:15:22,439 --> 02:15:24,150
I asked.

1645
02:15:24,150 --> 02:15:28,389
'A Martian!' said the curate.

1646
02:15:28,389 --> 02:15:37,590
Our situation was so strange and unbelievable
that for three or four hours, until the dawn

1647
02:15:37,590 --> 02:15:41,059
came, we hardly moved.

1648
02:15:41,059 --> 02:15:47,489
And then the light came, not through the window,
which was filled with earth from the garden,

1649
02:15:47,489 --> 02:15:52,610
but through a small hole that had been knocked
in the wall.

1650
02:15:52,610 --> 02:15:59,099
Through this we saw the body of a Martian,
watching a cylinder which was still red with

1651
02:15:59,099 --> 02:16:01,189
heat.

1652
02:16:01,189 --> 02:16:07,920
When we saw that, we moved as slowly as possible
out of the grey light of the kitchen and into

1653
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:10,869
the darkness of the hall.

1654
02:16:10,869 --> 02:16:15,039
Suddenly, the truth came to me.

1655
02:16:15,039 --> 02:16:18,289
'The fifth cylinder!'

1656
02:16:18,289 --> 02:16:19,289
I whispered.

1657
02:16:19,289 --> 02:16:27,030
'It's hit this house and buried us under the
ruins!'

1658
02:16:27,030 --> 02:16:36,380
For a time the curate was silent, then he
said, 'God help us!'

1659
02:16:36,380 --> 02:16:41,580
For hours we lay there in the darkness, while
from outside came the sounds of hammering

1660
02:16:41,580 --> 02:16:48,670
and then, after some time, a sound like an
engine.

1661
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:53,290
Towards the end of the day I found that I
was very hungry.

1662
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:58,650
I told the curate that I was going to look
for food, and moved back into the kitchen

1663
02:16:58,650 --> 02:17:00,960
again.

1664
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:09,160
He did not answer, but as soon as I began
eating I heard him crawling towards me.

1665
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:14,040
After eating we went back to the hall, and
I fell asleep.

1666
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:18,710
When I woke up and looked around I was alone.

1667
02:17:18,710 --> 02:17:24,390
I crawled back into the kitchen and saw him
lying down and looking out of the hole at

1668
02:17:24,390 --> 02:17:26,250
the Martians.

1669
02:17:26,250 --> 02:17:30,340
The noises still continued.

1670
02:17:30,340 --> 02:17:37,180
Through the hole I could see the top of a
tree, turned to gold by the evening sun.

1671
02:17:37,180 --> 02:17:42,200
I stepped carefully through the broken plates
that covered the floor.

1672
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:49,190
I touched the curate's leg, and he moved so
suddenly that some bricks slid down outside

1673
02:17:49,190 --> 02:17:52,170
with a loud crash.

1674
02:17:52,170 --> 02:18:01,040
I took hold of his arm, afraid that he might
cry out, and for a long time we remained still.

1675
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:06,070
Then I raised my head cautiously to see what
had happened.

1676
02:18:06,070 --> 02:18:11,160
The falling bricks had left another hole in
the wall of the building.

1677
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:19,460
Through this I was able to see into what had
been, only the previous night, a quiet road.

1678
02:18:19,460 --> 02:18:22,880
Things had changed greatly.

1679
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:30,990
The fifth cylinder had not fallen on our house,
but on top of the house next door.

1680
02:18:30,990 --> 02:18:34,310
The building had completely disappeared.

1681
02:18:34,310 --> 02:18:40,881
The cylinder had gone right through it and
made a large hole in the ground, much larger

1682
02:18:40,881 --> 02:18:44,820
than the pit I had looked into in Woking.

1683
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:49,160
The earth all around had been thrown up over
the neighbouring houses.

1684
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:52,120
Our house had fallen backwards.

1685
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:56,340
The front part of it had been destroyed completely.

1686
02:18:56,340 --> 02:19:03,060
By chance the kitchen had escaped and now
stood buried under earth and bricks, covered

1687
02:19:03,060 --> 02:19:08,120
on every side except towards the cylinder.

1688
02:19:08,120 --> 02:19:15,790
We now lay on the very edge of the enormous
round pit that the Martians were making.

1689
02:19:15,790 --> 02:19:21,830
The cylinder was already open in the centre
of the pit, and on the furthest side one of

1690
02:19:21,830 --> 02:19:29,390
the great fighting-machines, empty now, stood
tall and unmoving against the evening sky.

1691
02:19:29,390 --> 02:19:37,040
However, at first I hardly noticed the pit
and the cylinder, because of the strange shining

1692
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:43,969
machine that I saw working there, and the
odd creatures that were crawling slowly and

1693
02:19:43,969 --> 02:19:47,480
painfully across the earth near it.

1694
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:56,381
This machine was shaped like a spider with
five legs and a great number of tentacles.

1695
02:19:56,381 --> 02:20:01,601
With these it was taking pieces of metal out
of the cylinder and laying them on the earth

1696
02:20:01,601 --> 02:20:03,070
behind it.

1697
02:20:03,070 --> 02:20:11,680
It was doing this so quickly and perfectly
that I did not see it as a machine at first.

1698
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:20,811
The fighting-machines were extraordinary,
but could not compare to this building-machine.

1699
02:20:20,811 --> 02:20:27,871
People who have never seen these things can
hardly understand how alive they looked.

1700
02:20:27,871 --> 02:20:35,120
I had seen the Martians themselves once before,
but only for a short time, and then the sight

1701
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:37,950
had almost made me sick.

1702
02:20:37,950 --> 02:20:43,980
Now I was more used to them, and was in a
good position with a lot of time to study

1703
02:20:43,980 --> 02:20:46,561
them properly.

1704
02:20:46,561 --> 02:20:51,551
They were the strangest creatures it is possible
to imagine.

1705
02:20:51,551 --> 02:21:00,630
They had large, round bodies - or perhaps
heads - about a metre and a half across.

1706
02:21:00,630 --> 02:21:03,530
Each body had a face in front of it.

1707
02:21:03,530 --> 02:21:10,900
This face had no nose - I do not think they
had any sense of smell - but it had a pair

1708
02:21:10,900 --> 02:21:20,141
of very large, dark eyes, and just beneath
these a kind of v-shaped mouth.

1709
02:21:20,141 --> 02:21:27,011
In the back of the head, or body - I do not
really know what to call it - there was a

1710
02:21:27,011 --> 02:21:33,820
flat surface like the skin of a drum, which
we now know worked as an ear.

1711
02:21:33,820 --> 02:21:41,601
Around the mouth were sixteen thin, whip-like
tentacles, arranged in two groups of eight.

1712
02:21:41,601 --> 02:21:43,670
These worked like hands.

1713
02:21:43,670 --> 02:21:50,900
As I watched the Martians, they seemed to
be trying to raise themselves on the hands,

1714
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:56,141
but with their increased weight on Earth this
was impossible.

1715
02:21:56,141 --> 02:22:00,961
It may be that on Mars they moved around on
them quite easily.

1716
02:22:00,961 --> 02:22:08,210
Most of the space inside their bodies was
taken by the brain.

1717
02:22:08,210 --> 02:22:13,410
Besides this they had a heart, but they had
no stomach because they did not eat.

1718
02:22:13,410 --> 02:22:20,420
Instead, they took fresh blood from living
creatures and used a tube to put it straight

1719
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:23,211
into their own bodies.

1720
02:22:23,211 --> 02:22:30,000
This idea seems horrible to us, but at the
same time I think we should remember how disgusting

1721
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:36,120
our meat-eating habits would seem to an intelligent
rabbit.

1722
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:39,670
In three other ways their bodies were different
from ours.

1723
02:22:39,670 --> 02:22:46,860
They did not sleep, and because they had very
simple bodies they never seemed to get tired.

1724
02:22:46,860 --> 02:22:51,830
On Earth they could not move without effort,
but even at the end of their time here they

1725
02:22:51,830 --> 02:22:53,660
remained active.

1726
02:22:53,660 --> 02:22:59,450
In twenty-four hours they did twenty-four
hours of work.

1727
02:22:59,450 --> 02:23:05,660
Also, strange as it may seem, the Martians
were absolutely without sex.

1728
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:12,500
A young Martian, we now know, was born on
Earth during the war, and it was found growing

1729
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:17,471
out of the body of its parent, just like some
young plants.

1730
02:23:17,471 --> 02:23:22,311
A final difference seems very unimportant.

1731
02:23:22,311 --> 02:23:29,930
Germs, which cause so much disease and pain
on Earth, have either never appeared on Mars

1732
02:23:29,930 --> 02:23:36,841
or they got rid of them a long time ago.

1733
02:23:36,841 --> 02:23:42,291
It is generally supposed that the Martians
communicated by sounds and by moving their

1734
02:23:42,291 --> 02:23:43,291
arms.

1735
02:23:43,291 --> 02:23:50,250
But no human being saw as much of them as
I did and lived to tell the story, and I can

1736
02:23:50,250 --> 02:23:57,760
say that I have seen four, five or six of
them slowly performing the most difficult

1737
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:01,570
work without sound or any other signal.

1738
02:24:01,570 --> 02:24:12,851
I know a little of psychology and I am absolutely
certain that they exchanged thoughts.

1739
02:24:12,851 --> 02:24:18,410
While I was still watching their slow movements
in the sunlight, the curate pulled violently

1740
02:24:18,410 --> 02:24:20,130
at my arm.

1741
02:24:20,130 --> 02:24:26,780
I turned and saw an unhappy face and silent,
moving lips.

1742
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:29,771
He wanted to see what was happening.

1743
02:24:29,771 --> 02:24:34,610
The hole was only big enough for one of us
to look through, so I had to stop watching

1744
02:24:34,610 --> 02:24:40,090
them for a time while he had his chance.

1745
02:24:40,090 --> 02:24:45,791
When I looked again, the busy building-machine
had already put together several of the pieces

1746
02:24:45,791 --> 02:24:52,711
of metal from inside the cylinder into a shape
that was very like its own.

1747
02:24:52,711 --> 02:24:59,190
Down on the left a busy little digging-machine
could be seen, sending out small clouds of

1748
02:24:59,190 --> 02:25:05,710
green smoke and working its way round the
pit, making it bigger and piling the earth

1749
02:25:05,710 --> 02:25:07,760
up over the top.

1750
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:12,340
This was what had caused the regular heating
noise.

1751
02:25:12,340 --> 02:25:19,160
It whistled as it worked, and no Martian seemed
to be controlling it.

1752
02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:24,041
CHAPTER TWELVE

1753
02:25:24,041 --> 02:25:28,330
In the Ruined House

1754
02:25:28,330 --> 02:25:34,750
The arrival of a second fighting-machine made
us move back out of the kitchen into the hall,

1755
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:40,970
because we were afraid that from that height
the Martian might see us through the hole.

1756
02:25:40,970 --> 02:25:46,431
At a later date we began to feel less in danger
of being seen because the sunlight outside

1757
02:25:46,431 --> 02:25:54,790
was very bright, but at first anything approaching
the house drove us back into the hall in fear.

1758
02:25:54,790 --> 02:26:00,760
However, despite the danger, we could not
prevent ourselves from going back to look

1759
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:02,690
again and again.

1760
02:26:02,690 --> 02:26:12,061
In our desire to watch, we even fought each
other within a few centimeters of being seen.

1761
02:26:12,061 --> 02:26:19,301
We were very different people with different
habits of thought and action, and those differences

1762
02:26:19,301 --> 02:26:24,391
increased because we were living together
in this dangerous place.

1763
02:26:24,391 --> 02:26:32,130
The curate talked endlessly, and this prevented
me from forming a plan of action.

1764
02:26:32,130 --> 02:26:39,230
He had no self-control at all and sometimes
cried for hours at a time.

1765
02:26:39,230 --> 02:26:44,990
He ate more than I did, and did not seem to
understand that we had to stay in the house

1766
02:26:44,990 --> 02:26:50,851
until the Martians had finished their work
if we wanted to stay alive.

1767
02:26:50,851 --> 02:26:55,200
I tried threatening him, and in the end I
hit him.

1768
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:58,250
That worked for some time.

1769
02:26:58,250 --> 02:27:04,251
The curate was watching through the hole when
the first men were brought there.

1770
02:27:04,251 --> 02:27:07,820
I was sitting near him, listening hard.

1771
02:27:07,820 --> 02:27:14,250
He made a sudden movement backwards and for
a moment I shared his panic.

1772
02:27:14,250 --> 02:27:22,221
Then curiosity gave me courage and I got up,
stepped across him and went to the hole.

1773
02:27:22,221 --> 02:27:26,250
At first I could see no reason for his behaviour.

1774
02:27:26,250 --> 02:27:31,210
The night was coming but the Martians had
lights on their machines.

1775
02:27:31,210 --> 02:27:36,771
The whole scene was one of moving lights and
shadows, difficult for the eyes.

1776
02:27:36,771 --> 02:27:42,130
The Martians at the bottom of the pit could
no longer be seen, because the earth around

1777
02:27:42,130 --> 02:27:44,320
it was now so high.

1778
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:48,920
A fighting- machine stood in the corner of
the pit.

1779
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:56,650
Then, through the noise of the machinery,
came the faint sound of human voices.

1780
02:27:56,650 --> 02:28:03,000
I watched the fighting-machine closely, sure
for the first time that it did actually contain

1781
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,211
a Martian.

1782
02:28:04,211 --> 02:28:10,510
I could see the oily shine of its skin and
the brightness of its eyes.

1783
02:28:10,510 --> 02:28:17,670
And suddenly I heard a shout and saw a long
tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the

1784
02:28:17,670 --> 02:28:21,490
machine to the little cage on its back.

1785
02:28:21,490 --> 02:28:28,280
Then something - something struggling violently
- was lifted high against the sky and brought

1786
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:30,380
down again.

1787
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:33,070
I saw that it was a man.

1788
02:28:33,070 --> 02:28:41,570
He was fat, red- faced, middle-aged, well-dressed;
perhaps earlier he had been important.

1789
02:28:41,570 --> 02:28:46,860
He disappeared behind the pile of earth and
for a moment there was silence.

1790
02:28:46,860 --> 02:28:53,860
Then we heard him scream and the sound of
long and cheerful calling from the Martians.

1791
02:28:53,860 --> 02:29:01,880
I moved away from the hole, put my hands over
my ears and ran into the hall.

1792
02:29:01,880 --> 02:29:07,960
The curate, who had been lying silently with
his arms over his head, looked up as I passed,

1793
02:29:07,960 --> 02:29:13,410
cried out quite loudly and came running after
me.

1794
02:29:13,410 --> 02:29:23,480
That night, as we hid in the hall, I felt
a great need to do something but could think

1795
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:25,210
of no plan of escape.

1796
02:29:25,210 --> 02:29:33,340
But afterwards, during the second day, I was
able to consider our position clearly.

1797
02:29:33,340 --> 02:29:38,710
The curate, I found, was quite unable to discuss
anything.

1798
02:29:38,710 --> 02:29:44,460
The death of the man outside had taken away
all his powers of thought.

1799
02:29:44,460 --> 02:29:48,740
He had almost sunk to the level of an animal.

1800
02:29:48,740 --> 02:29:55,000
I began to think that, although our position
was terrible, there was no reason yet to give

1801
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,051
up hope.

1802
02:29:57,051 --> 02:30:01,860
The Martians might only stay in this pit for
a short time, then move on.

1803
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:07,330
Or if they stayed permanently, they might
not think it necessary to watch it all the

1804
02:30:07,330 --> 02:30:10,290
time.

1805
02:30:10,290 --> 02:30:16,521
On the third day, if I remember correctly,
I saw a boy killed.

1806
02:30:16,521 --> 02:30:22,690
It was the only occasion on which I actually
saw the Martians feed.

1807
02:30:22,690 --> 02:30:26,032
After that I avoided the hole in the wall
for most of a day.

1808
02:30:26,032 --> 02:30:35,540
The Martians had made such an impression on
me that at first I did not think I could escape.

1809
02:30:35,540 --> 02:30:39,251
I did not think that they could be defeated
by human beings.

1810
02:30:39,251 --> 02:30:46,851
But on the fourth or fifth night I heard a
sound like heavy guns.

1811
02:30:46,851 --> 02:30:50,610
It was very late and the moon was shining
brightly.

1812
02:30:50,610 --> 02:30:56,090
The Martians had taken away the digging-machine
and apart from the fighting-machine on the

1813
02:30:56,090 --> 02:31:01,740
far side of the pit and a building- machine
that was busy out of my sight, the pit was

1814
02:31:01,740 --> 02:31:02,740
empty.

1815
02:31:02,740 --> 02:31:08,851
I heard a dog, and that familiar sound made
me listen.

1816
02:31:08,851 --> 02:31:13,970
Then I heard a noise exactly like the sound
of big guns.

1817
02:31:13,970 --> 02:31:18,630
I heard six bangs and then six more.

1818
02:31:18,630 --> 02:31:24,700
And that was all.

1819
02:31:24,700 --> 02:31:30,641
On the sixth day of our imprisonment I looked
out for the last time, and I soon found myself

1820
02:31:30,641 --> 02:31:33,070
alone.

1821
02:31:33,070 --> 02:31:37,610
Instead of staying close and trying to move
me away from the pit, the curate had gone

1822
02:31:37,610 --> 02:31:40,130
back into the hall.

1823
02:31:40,130 --> 02:31:46,671
I followed him quickly and quietly and in
the darkness I heard him drinking.

1824
02:31:46,671 --> 02:31:52,440
I put my hand out and my fingers closed around
a bottle of wine.

1825
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:54,500
For a few minutes we fought together.

1826
02:31:54,500 --> 02:32:00,860
The bottle hit the floor and broke, and I
stopped fighting and got up.

1827
02:32:00,860 --> 02:32:04,580
We stood breathing heavily, staring at each
other.

1828
02:32:04,580 --> 02:32:12,500
In the end I moved between him and the food
and told him that I was going to take control.

1829
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:17,920
I divided the food in the cupboard into separate
amounts to last us ten days.

1830
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:20,740
I would not let him eat any more that day.

1831
02:32:20,740 --> 02:32:24,971
In the afternoon he tried to get some food.

1832
02:32:24,971 --> 02:32:28,431
I had been asleep but in a moment I was awake.

1833
02:32:28,431 --> 02:32:33,840
All day and all night we sat face to face.

1834
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:40,230
I was tired but would not give up, and he
cried and complained about his immediate hunger.

1835
02:32:40,230 --> 02:32:48,480
The rest of the time he just talked to himself,
and I began to realize that he had gone completely

1836
02:32:48,480 --> 02:32:52,490
mad.

1837
02:32:52,490 --> 02:32:56,670
Through the eighth and ninth days his voice
grew louder.

1838
02:32:56,670 --> 02:33:02,080
He threatened me, begged me, and this was
mixed with a great deal of talk about his

1839
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:05,101
service to God.

1840
02:33:05,101 --> 02:33:10,881
Then he slept for some time and began again
with even more strength, so loudly that I

1841
02:33:10,881 --> 02:33:12,980
had to try to stop him.

1842
02:33:12,980 --> 02:33:15,240
'Be still!'

1843
02:33:15,240 --> 02:33:17,311
I demanded.

1844
02:33:17,311 --> 02:33:18,950
He rose to his knees.

1845
02:33:18,950 --> 02:33:27,470
'I have been still too long,' he said, loud
enough for the Martians to hear, 'and now

1846
02:33:27,470 --> 02:33:30,311
I must tell the world.

1847
02:33:30,311 --> 02:33:35,990
This place will be destroyed because of the
bad things we have done!'

1848
02:33:35,990 --> 02:33:38,160
'Shut up!'

1849
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:40,880
I said, getting to my feet.

1850
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:42,210
'Please -'

1851
02:33:42,210 --> 02:33:46,141
'No!' he shouted, at the top of his voice.

1852
02:33:46,141 --> 02:33:47,141
'Speak!

1853
02:33:47,141 --> 02:33:53,120
The word of God is with me!'

1854
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:57,800
In three steps he was at the door leading
to the kitchen.

1855
02:33:57,800 --> 02:34:02,471
I went after him, picking up the coal-hammer
as I entered the room.

1856
02:34:02,471 --> 02:34:07,830
Before he was half-way across the floor, I
was right behind him.

1857
02:34:07,830 --> 02:34:12,160
I swung the hammer and hit him on the back
of the head.

1858
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:17,250
He fell forwards and lay flat on the floor.

1859
02:34:17,250 --> 02:34:22,730
I stepped over him and stood there breathing
hard.

1860
02:34:22,730 --> 02:34:24,200
He did not move.

1861
02:34:24,200 --> 02:34:32,280
Suddenly, I heard a noise outside and the
hole in the wall became dark.

1862
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:38,360
I looked up and saw the lower part of a building-
machine coming slowly across it.

1863
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:45,940
Then, through a sort of glass plate, I saw
the large, dark eyes of a Martian, and one

1864
02:34:45,940 --> 02:34:49,771
of its tentacles appeared, moving in through
the hole.

1865
02:34:49,771 --> 02:34:56,340
I turned, tripped over the curate and stopped
at the hall door.

1866
02:34:56,340 --> 02:35:04,000
The tentacle was now two metres or more into
the room, moving backwards and forwards with

1867
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,881
strange, sudden movements.

1868
02:35:06,881 --> 02:35:09,261
I forced myself back into the hall.

1869
02:35:09,261 --> 02:35:15,021
I shook violently and could hardly stand straight.

1870
02:35:15,021 --> 02:35:16,830
Had the Martian seen me?

1871
02:35:16,830 --> 02:35:20,521
What was it doing now?

1872
02:35:20,521 --> 02:35:26,771
Then I heard the sound of a heavy body - I
knew whose it was - being dragged across the

1873
02:35:26,771 --> 02:35:30,580
floor of the kitchen towards the opening.

1874
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:36,620
I could not stop myself - I moved to the door
and looked back into the kitchen.

1875
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:43,120
In the light from outside, I saw the Martian
studying the curate's head.

1876
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:48,360
I thought at once that it would know that
I was there from the mark of the hammer.

1877
02:35:48,360 --> 02:35:56,710
I shut the door and moved back into the hall
and tried to hide myself in the corner.

1878
02:35:56,710 --> 02:36:03,710
Then I heard a faint metallic sound as the
tentacle moved back across the kitchen floor.

1879
02:36:03,710 --> 02:36:07,440
I thought that it might not be long enough
to reach me.

1880
02:36:07,440 --> 02:36:10,000
I prayed.

1881
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:13,220
Then I heard it touching the handle.

1882
02:36:13,220 --> 02:36:15,880
It had found the door.

1883
02:36:15,880 --> 02:36:20,340
The Martians understood doors!

1884
02:36:20,340 --> 02:36:27,920
It moved the handle up and down for a moment,
and then the door opened.

1885
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:34,070
In the darkness I could just see the thing
moving towards me and examining the wall and

1886
02:36:34,070 --> 02:36:36,301
the floor.

1887
02:36:36,301 --> 02:36:41,551
It was like a black snake moving its head
from side to side.

1888
02:36:41,551 --> 02:36:46,000
Once, even, it touched my boot.

1889
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:50,620
I almost screamed, but I bit my hand.

1890
02:36:50,620 --> 02:36:57,790
For a time it did not move, then it moved
back through the door.

1891
02:36:57,790 --> 02:37:03,860
I heard it go into the food cupboard, It moved
the tins and a bottle broke.

1892
02:37:03,860 --> 02:37:08,181
Then there was silence.

1893
02:37:08,181 --> 02:37:10,670
Had it gone?

1894
02:37:10,670 --> 02:37:14,650
At last I decided that it had.

1895
02:37:14,650 --> 02:37:22,341
The tentacle did not come into the hall again,
but I lay all the tenth day in the darkness,

1896
02:37:22,341 --> 02:37:24,870
too frightened even to move for a drink.

1897
02:37:24,870 --> 02:37:31,000
I did not enter the kitchen again for two
days.

1898
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:36,500
When at last I did, I found that the food
cupboard was now empty.

1899
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:40,271
The Martians had taken everything.

1900
02:37:40,271 --> 02:37:47,000
On that day and the next I had no food and
nothing to drink.

1901
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,920
On the twelfth day my thirst was so bad that
I went into the kitchen and used the noisy

1902
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:55,320
rainwater pump that stood by the sink.

1903
02:37:55,320 --> 02:37:59,351
I managed to get a couple of glasses of dirty
water.

1904
02:37:59,351 --> 02:38:05,570
This made me feel a lot better, and the noise
of the pump did not bring a tentacle in through

1905
02:38:05,570 --> 02:38:08,290
the opening.

1906
02:38:08,290 --> 02:38:15,961
On the thirteenth day I drank some more water,
and thought of impossible plans of escape.

1907
02:38:15,961 --> 02:38:22,840
Whenever I slept, I dreamed either of the
death of the curate or of wonderful dinners.

1908
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:30,660
Then, early on the fifteenth day, I heard
the sound of a dog outside.

1909
02:38:30,660 --> 02:38:34,030
This greatly surprised me.

1910
02:38:34,030 --> 02:38:38,480
I went into the kitchen and saw its head looking
in through the hole.

1911
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:44,730
I thought that if I could attract it in quietly,
I would be able, perhaps, to kill and eat

1912
02:38:44,730 --> 02:38:45,891
it.

1913
02:38:45,891 --> 02:38:51,540
It would be a good idea to kill it anyway,
in case its actions attracted the attention

1914
02:38:51,540 --> 02:38:53,630
of the Martians.

1915
02:38:53,630 --> 02:38:58,041
I moved forwards, saying, 'Good dog!'

1916
02:38:58,041 --> 02:39:05,380
very softly, but it suddenly pulled his head
back and disappeared.

1917
02:39:05,380 --> 02:39:07,300
I listened.

1918
02:39:07,300 --> 02:39:11,970
I heard the sound of some birds but that was
all.

1919
02:39:11,970 --> 02:39:18,271
For a long time I lay close to the opening
until, encouraged by the silence, I looked

1920
02:39:18,271 --> 02:39:20,961
out.

1921
02:39:20,961 --> 02:39:26,260
Except in the corner, where a number of birds
fought over some dead bodies, there was not

1922
02:39:26,260 --> 02:39:29,400
a living thing in the pit.

1923
02:39:29,400 --> 02:39:34,630
I stared around, hardly believing my eyes.

1924
02:39:34,630 --> 02:39:38,891
All the machinery had gone.

1925
02:39:38,891 --> 02:39:43,960
Slowly I made the opening larger and pushed
myself through it.

1926
02:39:43,960 --> 02:39:51,641
I could see in every direction except behind
me and there were no Martians in sight.

1927
02:39:51,641 --> 02:39:59,061
I hesitated, then with a rush of desperate
courage, and with my heart beating violently,

1928
02:39:59,061 --> 02:40:05,000
I climbed to the top of the pile of earth
in which I had been buried.

1929
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:10,030
When I had last seen this part of Sheen, it
had been a street of comfortable white and

1930
02:40:10,030 --> 02:40:11,670
red houses.

1931
02:40:11,670 --> 02:40:16,870
Now the neighboring ones had all been destroyed.

1932
02:40:16,870 --> 02:40:24,490
Far away I saw a thin cat walking along a
wall, but there was no sign of people.

1933
02:40:24,490 --> 02:40:31,030
After my time in the darkness, the day seemed
very bright, the sky was shining blue.

1934
02:40:31,030 --> 02:40:34,950
A gentle wind moved the flowers.

1935
02:40:34,950 --> 02:40:36,500
And oh!

1936
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:41,840
The sweetness of the air.

1937
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:48,480
For some time I stood there, not worrying
about my safety.

1938
02:40:48,480 --> 02:40:55,830
At that moment, I felt the beginning of something
that soon grew quite clear in my mind, that

1939
02:40:55,830 --> 02:40:58,631
worried me for many days.

1940
02:40:58,631 --> 02:41:06,671
I was not the master now, but an animal among
the animals, under the power of the Martians.

1941
02:41:06,671 --> 02:41:10,440
The rule of man had ended.

1942
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:18,881
But as soon as this feeling came, it left
me, and my main problem became hunger.

1943
02:41:18,881 --> 02:41:23,050
I climbed a wall and fell into a neighboring
garden.

1944
02:41:23,050 --> 02:41:26,271
Here I found some young vegetables, which
I took.

1945
02:41:26,271 --> 02:41:31,200
Then I started walking towards the river.

1946
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:38,150
There were two ideas in my mind - to get more
food and to move, as quickly as possible,

1947
02:41:38,150 --> 02:41:41,431
away from the pit.

1948
02:41:41,431 --> 02:41:46,300
When I reached the Thames, I drank as much
water as I could.

1949
02:41:46,300 --> 02:41:50,290
I then walked up a hill to Putney Common.

1950
02:41:50,290 --> 02:41:56,291
Here I moved through areas which had been
totally destroyed and others which were totally

1951
02:41:56,291 --> 02:42:02,351
undamaged; houses with their curtains and
their doors closed.

1952
02:42:02,351 --> 02:42:10,090
I went into a couple of the houses, looking
for food, but all of it had already been taken.

1953
02:42:10,090 --> 02:42:16,601
I lay for the rest of the day in a garden,
too exhausted to go on.

1954
02:42:16,601 --> 02:42:23,390
All this time I saw no human beings and no
signs of the Martians.

1955
02:42:23,390 --> 02:42:29,340
I saw a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but
they hurried away from me.

1956
02:42:29,340 --> 02:42:36,320
I also saw some human bones, with all the
flesh eaten off.

1957
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:42,190
After sunset I struggled on along the road
towards Putney, and in a garden I found some

1958
02:42:42,190 --> 02:42:46,200
potatoes, enough to stop my hunger.

1959
02:42:46,200 --> 02:42:50,460
From there I looked down on Putney and the
river.

1960
02:42:50,460 --> 02:42:57,930
The view of blackened trees and empty ruined
buildings made me very unhappy.

1961
02:42:57,930 --> 02:43:04,131
And over all - silence.

1962
02:43:04,131 --> 02:43:08,920
It filled me with terror to think how quickly
that great change had come.

1963
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:16,840
Near the top of Putney Hill I came across
more human bones, eaten clean and left lying

1964
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:17,840
around.

1965
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:24,340
The Martians, it seemed, had killed and eaten
everyone around there, except for a few lucky

1966
02:43:24,340 --> 02:43:27,811
ones like myself.

1967
02:43:27,811 --> 02:43:30,591
They were now looking for food somewhere else.

1968
02:43:30,591 --> 02:43:37,970
Perhaps even now they were destroying Berlin
or Paris, or maybe they were moving north.

1969
02:43:37,970 --> 02:43:38,970
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1970
02:43:38,970 --> 02:43:44,601
The Man on Putney Hill

1971
02:43:44,601 --> 02:43:49,800
I spent that night in the pub that stands
on the top of Putney Hill, sleeping in a made

1972
02:43:49,800 --> 02:43:54,601
bed for the first time since I had run away
to Leatherhead.

1973
02:43:54,601 --> 02:44:00,880
I broke into the house - and afterwards found
that the front door was unlocked.

1974
02:44:00,880 --> 02:44:07,771
I searched every room for food until, when
I was ready to give up, I found some bread

1975
02:44:07,771 --> 02:44:10,860
and two tins of fruit in one of the bedrooms.

1976
02:44:10,860 --> 02:44:15,150
The place had already been searched and emptied.

1977
02:44:15,150 --> 02:44:20,710
Later, in the bar, I found some sandwiches
that no one had noticed.

1978
02:44:20,710 --> 02:44:25,840
I ate some of these and put the rest in my
pockets.

1979
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:30,890
I lit no lamps, afraid that a Martian might
come through that part of London looking for

1980
02:44:30,890 --> 02:44:34,540
food in the night.

1981
02:44:34,540 --> 02:44:40,461
Before I went to bed I was very restless and
went from window to window, looking out for

1982
02:44:40,461 --> 02:44:42,530
some sign of them.

1983
02:44:42,530 --> 02:44:45,050
I slept little.

1984
02:44:45,050 --> 02:44:51,290
As I lay in bed, I found myself thinking of
the killing of the curate.

1985
02:44:51,290 --> 02:44:58,910
I had no regrets about this, but in the stillness
of the night, with a sense that God was near,

1986
02:44:58,910 --> 02:45:05,591
I thought again of every part of our conversation
from the time we had first met.

1987
02:45:05,591 --> 02:45:09,090
We had been unable to co-operate.

1988
02:45:09,090 --> 02:45:16,370
If I had known, I would have left him at Walton,
but I had not been able to see ahead.

1989
02:45:16,370 --> 02:45:26,851
Nobody saw me kill him, but I have described
it here and the reader can make a judgement.

1990
02:45:26,851 --> 02:45:34,610
The morning was bright and fine and there
were little golden clouds in the eastern sky.

1991
02:45:34,610 --> 02:45:40,910
In the road that runs from the top of Putney
Hill to Wimbledon many things had been left

1992
02:45:40,910 --> 02:45:48,210
behind by the crowds that ran towards London
on the Sunday night after the fighting began.

1993
02:45:48,210 --> 02:45:51,681
There was a little two-wheeled cart with a
broken wheel.

1994
02:45:51,681 --> 02:45:55,450
It had the name of a shop written on it.

1995
02:45:55,450 --> 02:46:01,521
There was a hat lying in the mud, and a lot
of broken glass with blood on it.

1996
02:46:01,521 --> 02:46:08,500
I moved slowly because I was very tired and
my plans were uncertain.

1997
02:46:08,500 --> 02:46:14,190
I had an idea of going to Leatherhead, although
I knew there was little chance of finding

1998
02:46:14,190 --> 02:46:15,710
my wife there.

1999
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:24,550
Certainly, unless they had been killed, she
and my cousins would have run away.

2000
02:46:24,550 --> 02:46:29,650
I came to the edge of Wimbledon Common and
stood there, under cover of some trees and

2001
02:46:29,650 --> 02:46:30,830
bushes.

2002
02:46:30,830 --> 02:46:39,000
It stretched far and wide and I hesitated
on the edge of that large open space.

2003
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:47,150
Soon I had an odd feeling of being watched
and, turning suddenly, I saw something hiding

2004
02:46:47,150 --> 02:46:48,980
in some of the bushes.

2005
02:46:48,980 --> 02:46:57,070
I took a step towards it, and it rose up and
became a man armed with a sword.

2006
02:46:57,070 --> 02:46:59,900
I approached him slowly.

2007
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:05,230
He stood silently, watching me but not moving.

2008
02:47:05,230 --> 02:47:12,620
As I came nearer, I saw that he was dressed
in clothes as dusty and dirty as my own.

2009
02:47:12,620 --> 02:47:20,181
His black hair fell over his eyes, and his
face was dark and dirty and thin, so at first

2010
02:47:20,181 --> 02:47:23,090
I did not recognize him.

2011
02:47:23,090 --> 02:47:29,200
'Stop!' he cried, when I was within ten metres
of him, and I stopped.

2012
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:33,840
'Where have you come from?' he said.

2013
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:36,090
I thought, watching him.

2014
02:47:36,090 --> 02:47:40,131
'I have come from Sheen,' I said.

2015
02:47:40,131 --> 02:47:44,011
'I was buried near the pit the Martians made
around their cylinder.

2016
02:47:44,011 --> 02:47:45,570
I have escaped.'

2017
02:47:45,570 --> 02:47:49,890
'There is no food around here,' he said.

2018
02:47:49,890 --> 02:47:56,700
'This is my country: all this hill down to
the river and up to the edge of the common.

2019
02:47:56,700 --> 02:48:00,881
There is only food for one.

2020
02:48:00,881 --> 02:48:02,570
Which way are you going?'

2021
02:48:02,570 --> 02:48:06,960
'I don't know,' I said.

2022
02:48:06,960 --> 02:48:12,710
He looked at me uncertainly, then his expression
suddenly changed.

2023
02:48:12,710 --> 02:48:14,330
He pointed at me.

2024
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:19,721
'It's you,' he said,'- the man from Woking.

2025
02:48:19,721 --> 02:48:23,870
And you weren't killed at Weybridge?'

2026
02:48:23,870 --> 02:48:26,660
I recognized him at the same moment.

2027
02:48:26,660 --> 02:48:30,490
'You're the soldier who came into my garden.'

2028
02:48:30,490 --> 02:48:34,340
'What luck!' he said.

2029
02:48:34,340 --> 02:48:38,710
'We are lucky ones!'

2030
02:48:38,710 --> 02:48:41,010
He put out a hand and I took it.

2031
02:48:41,010 --> 02:48:43,450
'I hid,' he said.

2032
02:48:43,450 --> 02:48:46,931
'But they didn't kill everyone.

2033
02:48:46,931 --> 02:48:51,500
And after they went away, I went towards Walton
across the fields.

2034
02:48:51,500 --> 02:48:59,630
But - it's only been sixteen days and your
hair is grey.'

2035
02:48:59,630 --> 02:49:02,980
He looked over his shoulder suddenly.

2036
02:49:02,980 --> 02:49:04,980
'Only a bird,' he said.

2037
02:49:04,980 --> 02:49:08,070
'This is a bit open.

2038
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:11,130
Let's crawl under those bushes and talk.'

2039
02:49:11,130 --> 02:49:13,820
'Have you seen any Martians?'

2040
02:49:13,820 --> 02:49:14,840
I asked.

2041
02:49:14,840 --> 02:49:16,490
'Since I got out-'

2042
02:49:16,490 --> 02:49:20,021
'They've gone away across London,' he said.

2043
02:49:20,021 --> 02:49:23,841
'I guess they've got a bigger camp there.

2044
02:49:23,841 --> 02:49:27,420
The night before last I saw some lights up
in the air.

2045
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:33,380
I believe they've built a flying-machine and
are learning to fly'

2046
02:49:33,380 --> 02:49:38,650
I stopped, on hands and knees, because we
had come to the bushes.

2047
02:49:38,650 --> 02:49:40,190
'Fly!'

2048
02:49:40,190 --> 02:49:42,780
'Yes,' he said, 'fly!'

2049
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:48,950
I crawled into an open space in the bushes
and sat down.

2050
02:49:48,950 --> 02:49:54,471
'If they manage to do that, we haven't got
a chance,' I said.

2051
02:49:54,471 --> 02:49:57,440
'They will simply go round the world.'

2052
02:49:57,440 --> 02:49:58,790
'They will.

2053
02:49:58,790 --> 02:50:02,601
But it will make things easier around here.

2054
02:50:02,601 --> 02:50:05,960
And besides ...' he looked at me.

2055
02:50:05,960 --> 02:50:10,681
'Don't you believe that we're beaten?

2056
02:50:10,681 --> 02:50:13,480
I do.'

2057
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:16,290
I stared.

2058
02:50:16,290 --> 02:50:21,700
Strange as it may seem, I had not thought
of things this way, although it was perfectly

2059
02:50:21,700 --> 02:50:22,700
obvious.

2060
02:50:22,700 --> 02:50:25,820
I had still held onto some hope.

2061
02:50:25,820 --> 02:50:29,360
'It's finished,' he said.

2062
02:50:29,360 --> 02:50:32,530
'They've lost one - just one.

2063
02:50:32,530 --> 02:50:39,110
And they've taken over the capital of the
most powerful country in the world.

2064
02:50:39,110 --> 02:50:43,271
The death of that one at Weybridge was an
accident.

2065
02:50:43,271 --> 02:50:46,010
And these are only the first ones.

2066
02:50:46,010 --> 02:50:48,300
They keep coming.

2067
02:50:48,300 --> 02:50:54,670
These green stars - I've seen none for five
or six days, but I've no doubt they're falling

2068
02:50:54,670 --> 02:50:57,990
somewhere every night.

2069
02:50:57,990 --> 02:51:00,380
There's nothing we can do.

2070
02:51:00,380 --> 02:51:03,540
We're beaten!'

2071
02:51:03,540 --> 02:51:05,840
I did not answer.

2072
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:12,840
I sat staring in front of me, trying without
success to find a way of arguing against him.

2073
02:51:12,840 --> 02:51:17,960
Suddenly, I remembered the night I had watched
through the telescope.

2074
02:51:17,960 --> 02:51:25,210
'After the tenth shot they fired no more - at
least until the first cylinder came.'

2075
02:51:25,210 --> 02:51:29,711
'How do you know?' said the soldier.

2076
02:51:29,711 --> 02:51:31,210
I explained.

2077
02:51:31,210 --> 02:51:34,670
'Something wrong with the gun?' he said.

2078
02:51:34,670 --> 02:51:39,640
'But even if there is, they'll get it right
again.'

2079
02:51:39,640 --> 02:51:42,021
We sat looking at each other.

2080
02:51:42,021 --> 02:51:44,670
'And what will they do with us?'

2081
02:51:44,670 --> 02:51:45,670
I said.

2082
02:51:45,670 --> 02:51:49,340
'That's what I've been thinking.' he said.

2083
02:51:49,340 --> 02:51:54,290
'It seems to me that at the moment they catch
us when they want food.

2084
02:51:54,290 --> 02:51:57,620
But they won't keep doing that.

2085
02:51:57,620 --> 02:52:03,710
As soon as they've destroyed all our guns
and ships and railways, they'll begin to catch

2086
02:52:03,710 --> 02:52:09,630
us one by one, picking the best and keeping
us in cages and things.

2087
02:52:09,630 --> 02:52:11,720
They haven't begun on us yet.

2088
02:52:11,720 --> 02:52:15,080
Don't you see that?'

2089
02:52:15,080 --> 02:52:16,771
'Not begun!'

2090
02:52:16,771 --> 02:52:18,450
I cried.

2091
02:52:18,450 --> 02:52:20,130
'Not begun.

2092
02:52:20,130 --> 02:52:25,410
And instead of rushing around blindly, we've
got to change to suit the new situation.

2093
02:52:25,410 --> 02:52:27,890
That's how I see it.'

2094
02:52:27,890 --> 02:52:33,980
'But if that's true,' I said, 'what is there
to live for?'

2095
02:52:33,980 --> 02:52:42,500
'There won't be anything important for a million
years or more - no music, no art and no nice

2096
02:52:42,500 --> 02:52:44,521
little visits to restaurants.

2097
02:52:44,521 --> 02:52:46,260
No entertainment.

2098
02:52:46,260 --> 02:52:53,360
But men like me are going to go on living
- so human beings can continue.

2099
02:52:53,360 --> 02:52:59,070
And if I'm not mistaken, you'll show how strong
you are too.

2100
02:52:59,070 --> 02:53:01,730
We aren't going to be killed.

2101
02:53:01,730 --> 02:53:08,330
And I don't intend to be caught, either, and
caged and fattened.

2102
02:53:08,330 --> 02:53:10,000
Ugh!'

2103
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:11,000
'You don't mean -'

2104
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:12,360
'I do.

2105
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:13,730
I'm going on.

2106
02:53:13,730 --> 02:53:15,470
Under their feet.

2107
02:53:15,470 --> 02:53:18,000
I've thought about it.

2108
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,601
We've got to learn while we've got a chance.

2109
02:53:20,601 --> 02:53:26,120
And we've got to live and stay independent
while we learn.

2110
02:53:26,120 --> 02:53:29,360
That's what has to be done.'

2111
02:53:29,360 --> 02:53:34,760
I stared, surprised and greatly affected by
the man's courage.

2112
02:53:34,760 --> 02:53:36,950
'Good God!'

2113
02:53:36,950 --> 02:53:39,140
I said.

2114
02:53:39,140 --> 02:53:42,420
'You are a brave man.'

2115
02:53:42,420 --> 02:53:44,851
And suddenly I held his hand.

2116
02:53:44,851 --> 02:53:49,030
'Go on,' I said.

2117
02:53:49,030 --> 02:53:53,070
'Well, people who intend to escape them must
get ready.

2118
02:53:53,070 --> 02:53:54,990
I'm getting ready.

2119
02:53:54,990 --> 02:54:01,460
But not all of us can live like animals, and
that's how we'll have to live.

2120
02:54:01,460 --> 02:54:03,000
That's why I watched you.

2121
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,171
I had my doubts.

2122
02:54:05,171 --> 02:54:06,171
You're thinner.

2123
02:54:06,171 --> 02:54:10,460
I didn't know that it was you, you see.

2124
02:54:10,460 --> 02:54:16,660
All these - the sort of people that lived
in these houses, all those little office workers

2125
02:54:16,660 --> 02:54:20,700
that used to live down that way - they'd be
no good.

2126
02:54:20,700 --> 02:54:27,250
They haven't any spirit in them - no proud
dreams and no great ideas.

2127
02:54:27,250 --> 02:54:32,530
They just used to rush off to work - I've
seen hundreds of them, with a bit of breakfast

2128
02:54:32,530 --> 02:54:38,851
in their hand, running to catch their train,
frightened they'd be sacked if they didn't.

2129
02:54:38,851 --> 02:54:43,391
Well, the Martians will be a good thing for
them.

2130
02:54:43,391 --> 02:54:49,370
Nice big cages, fattening food, no worry.

2131
02:54:49,370 --> 02:54:53,811
After a week or two running around the fields
on empty stomachs they'll come and be caught

2132
02:54:53,811 --> 02:54:55,570
quite happily.'

2133
02:54:55,570 --> 02:54:57,570
He paused.

2134
02:54:57,570 --> 02:55:03,521
'The Martians will probably make pets of some
of them; train them to do tricks - who knows?

2135
02:55:03,521 --> 02:55:07,430
And some, maybe, they will train to hunt us.'

2136
02:55:07,430 --> 02:55:11,200
'No,' I cried, 'that's impossible!

2137
02:55:11,200 --> 02:55:13,230
No human being -'

2138
02:55:13,230 --> 02:55:17,360
'What's the good of going on with such lies?'
said the soldier.

2139
02:55:17,360 --> 02:55:20,690
'There are men who would do it cheerfully.

2140
02:55:20,690 --> 02:55:24,410
What nonsense to pretend there aren't!'

2141
02:55:24,410 --> 02:55:28,250
And I realized that I agreed with him.

2142
02:55:28,250 --> 02:55:32,681
I sat and thought about these things.

2143
02:55:32,681 --> 02:55:38,080
It was interesting that he, an ordinary soldier,
seemed to have a much better understanding

2144
02:55:38,080 --> 02:55:43,130
of the situation than I, a professional writer.

2145
02:55:43,130 --> 02:55:45,230
'What plans do you have?'

2146
02:55:45,230 --> 02:55:47,110
I said.

2147
02:55:47,110 --> 02:55:48,800
He hesitated.

2148
02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:55,530
'Well, we have to invent a life where people
can live and have children, and be safe enough

2149
02:55:55,530 --> 02:55:57,391
to bring the children up.

2150
02:55:57,391 --> 02:56:04,101
Yes - wait a bit, and I'll make it clearer
what I think ought to be done.

2151
02:56:04,101 --> 02:56:12,101
The ones the Martians capture will be like
farm animals; in a few years they'll be big,

2152
02:56:12,101 --> 02:56:14,670
beautiful, stupid - rubbish.

2153
02:56:14,670 --> 02:56:19,660
But we who stay free risk turning into wild
animals.

2154
02:56:19,660 --> 02:56:23,671
'You see, I intend to live underground.

2155
02:56:23,671 --> 02:56:27,601
I've been thinking about the drains.

2156
02:56:27,601 --> 02:56:31,510
Under London there are hundreds of kilometres
of them.

2157
02:56:31,510 --> 02:56:36,930
And we can dig passages between the drains
and buildings.

2158
02:56:36,930 --> 02:56:41,010
And then there are the railways, where they
go underground.

2159
02:56:41,010 --> 02:56:42,330
You begin to see?

2160
02:56:42,330 --> 02:56:47,221
And we'll get some people together - strong,
clean-minded men.

2161
02:56:47,221 --> 02:56:50,610
We're not going to accept any rubbish that
comes in.

2162
02:56:50,610 --> 02:56:53,380
Weak ones go out again.'

2163
02:56:53,380 --> 02:56:56,261
'As you intended me to go?'

2164
02:56:56,261 --> 02:57:00,230
'Well - I discussed it, didn't I?

2165
02:57:00,230 --> 02:57:03,140
'We won't argue about that.

2166
02:57:03,140 --> 02:57:04,920
Go on.'

2167
02:57:04,920 --> 02:57:08,050
'The people who stay will obey orders.

2168
02:57:08,050 --> 02:57:13,561
We want strong, good women too - mothers and
teachers.

2169
02:57:13,561 --> 02:57:16,080
No lazy ones with rolling eyes.

2170
02:57:16,080 --> 02:57:20,140
We can't have any weak or silly ones.

2171
02:57:20,140 --> 02:57:25,521
Life is real again, and the useless and bad
ones have to die.

2172
02:57:25,521 --> 02:57:27,141
They ought to die.

2173
02:57:27,141 --> 02:57:30,431
They ought to be willing to die.

2174
02:57:30,431 --> 02:57:34,351
It would be wrong of them to live and weaken
the others.

2175
02:57:34,351 --> 02:57:36,690
'But it's no good just staying alive.

2176
02:57:36,690 --> 02:57:39,900
That's just living like rats.

2177
02:57:39,900 --> 02:57:44,400
We have to save our knowledge, and add to
it.

2178
02:57:44,400 --> 02:57:46,990
That's why men like you are needed.

2179
02:57:46,990 --> 02:57:54,521
We must make great safe places deep underground,
and get all the books we can; not novels and

2180
02:57:54,521 --> 02:57:58,980
poetry, but ideas, science books.

2181
02:57:58,980 --> 02:58:03,960
We must go to the British Museum and choose
the best books in it.

2182
02:58:03,960 --> 02:58:10,101
Especially, we must keep our science - learn
more.'

2183
02:58:10,101 --> 02:58:13,561
The soldier paused and laid a brown hand on
my arm.

2184
02:58:13,561 --> 02:58:21,130
'In fact, it may not be so difficult to learn
how their fighting- machines work.

2185
02:58:21,130 --> 02:58:28,920
Think of four or five of them with men inside,
firing Heat-Rays back at the Martians!'

2186
02:58:28,920 --> 02:58:36,160
For some time the imagination of the soldier,
and the confidence and courage he showed,

2187
02:58:36,160 --> 02:58:39,110
persuaded me completely.

2188
02:58:39,110 --> 02:58:45,920
I believed in his idea of the future and in
the possibility of his plans.

2189
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:50,601
We talked like this through the early morning,
and later came out of the bushes.

2190
02:58:50,601 --> 02:58:57,351
After checking the sky for Martians, we hurried
quickly to the house on Putney Hill where

2191
02:58:57,351 --> 02:58:59,801
he had his hiding-place.

2192
02:58:59,801 --> 02:59:04,841
There I saw the work he had spent a week on.

2193
02:59:04,841 --> 02:59:12,280
It was a passage about ten metres long, designed
to reach the main drain on Putney Hill.

2194
02:59:12,280 --> 02:59:18,050
For the first time I began to think that there
was some distance between his dreams and his

2195
02:59:18,050 --> 02:59:22,370
powers, because I could dig a hole like this
in a day.

2196
02:59:22,370 --> 02:59:29,860
But I believed in him enough to work with
him all that morning at his digging.

2197
02:59:29,860 --> 02:59:37,250
As we worked I thought about the job, and
soon some doubts began to come into my mind.

2198
02:59:37,250 --> 02:59:43,261
I thought about the distance to the drain
and the chances of missing it completely.

2199
02:59:43,261 --> 02:59:50,620
I also felt that it would be easier to get
into the drain and dig back towards the house.

2200
02:59:50,620 --> 02:59:56,180
And just as I was beginning to face these
things, the soldier stopped digging and looked

2201
02:59:56,180 --> 02:59:57,650
at me.

2202
02:59:57,650 --> 03:00:01,240
'We're working well,' he said.

2203
03:00:01,240 --> 03:00:02,930
'Let's stop.

2204
03:00:02,930 --> 03:00:07,591
I think it's time we looked around from the
top of the house.'

2205
03:00:07,591 --> 03:00:11,860
I wanted to continue, but a thought came to
me.

2206
03:00:11,860 --> 03:00:17,690
'Why were you walking around on the common,'
I asked, 'instead of being here?'

2207
03:00:17,690 --> 03:00:21,251
'Taking the air,' he said.

2208
03:00:21,251 --> 03:00:22,280
'It's safer by night.'

2209
03:00:22,280 --> 03:00:25,610
'But the work?'

2210
03:00:25,610 --> 03:00:35,640
'Oh, one can't always work,' he said, and
in a flash I understood the man clearly.

2211
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:40,820
We went together to the roof and stood on
a ladder, looking out of the roof door.

2212
03:00:40,820 --> 03:00:44,620
No Martians could be seen.

2213
03:00:44,620 --> 03:00:47,721
We went back down into the house.

2214
03:00:47,721 --> 03:00:53,101
Neither of us wanted to start digging again,
and when he suggested a meal I was quite happy

2215
03:00:53,101 --> 03:00:56,160
to agree.

2216
03:00:56,160 --> 03:00:59,410
Afterwards we drank wine and played cards.

2217
03:00:59,410 --> 03:01:04,421
He won most of the games, and when we did
not want to play any more I went back up on

2218
03:01:04,421 --> 03:01:06,640
the roof.

2219
03:01:06,640 --> 03:01:12,220
I stayed there for a long time, looking north
over the city.

2220
03:01:12,220 --> 03:01:17,930
I began to feel that I had failed my wife,
and decided to leave this dreamer of great

2221
03:01:17,930 --> 03:01:21,261
things and to go on into London.

2222
03:01:21,261 --> 03:01:27,160
There, it seemed to me, I had the best chance
of learning what the Martians and human beings

2223
03:01:27,160 --> 03:01:28,920
were doing for death

2224
03:01:28,920 --> 03:01:31,550
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

2225
03:01:31,550 --> 03:01:35,290
Dead London

2226
03:01:35,290 --> 03:01:40,351
After I had said goodbye to the soldier, I
went down the hill, along the High Street

2227
03:01:40,351 --> 03:01:42,640
and across the bridge to Fulham.

2228
03:01:42,640 --> 03:01:49,630
There was black dust on the road after the
bridge, and it grew thicker in Fulham.

2229
03:01:49,630 --> 03:01:53,091
The streets were horribly quiet.

2230
03:01:53,091 --> 03:01:57,101
I found some old bread in a baker's shop there.

2231
03:01:57,101 --> 03:02:02,330
After that, the streets became clear of powder
and I passed some white houses which were

2232
03:02:02,330 --> 03:02:04,251
on fire.

2233
03:02:04,251 --> 03:02:09,940
The noise of burning was actually better than
silence.

2234
03:02:09,940 --> 03:02:12,900
Beyond Fulham the streets were quiet again.

2235
03:02:12,900 --> 03:02:17,470
Here I found more black powder and some dead
bodies.

2236
03:02:17,470 --> 03:02:22,101
I saw about ten along Fulham Road.

2237
03:02:22,101 --> 03:02:26,780
They had been dead for many days, so I hurried
quickly past them.

2238
03:02:26,780 --> 03:02:32,380
The black powder covered them and softened
their shapes.

2239
03:02:32,380 --> 03:02:36,061
One or two had been partly eaten by dogs.

2240
03:02:36,061 --> 03:02:43,561
Where there was no black powder, it was curiously
like Sunday in the financial area of London,

2241
03:02:43,561 --> 03:02:49,840
with the closed shops, the houses locked up
and the curtains closed.

2242
03:02:49,840 --> 03:02:56,260
In some places thieves had been at work, but
usually only at the food and wine shops.

2243
03:02:56,260 --> 03:03:02,601
A jeweller's window had been broken open in
one place, but the thief had clearly been

2244
03:03:02,601 --> 03:03:09,730
chased away, because a number of gold chains
and a watch were lying on the pavement.

2245
03:03:09,730 --> 03:03:14,930
I did not take the trouble to touch them.

2246
03:03:14,930 --> 03:03:20,440
Further down the road, a woman in torn clothes
was sitting on a doorstep.

2247
03:03:20,440 --> 03:03:25,450
The hand that hung over her knee was cut,
and blood had fallen onto her dirty brown

2248
03:03:25,450 --> 03:03:26,601
dress.

2249
03:03:26,601 --> 03:03:31,931
A broken bottle of wine had formed a pool
on the pavement.

2250
03:03:31,931 --> 03:03:37,051
She seemed asleep, but she was dead.

2251
03:03:37,051 --> 03:03:39,641
The silence grew greater.

2252
03:03:39,641 --> 03:03:48,040
But it was not the stillness of death - it
was the stillness of expectation.

2253
03:03:48,040 --> 03:03:53,391
At any time the destruction that had already
happened to the north-western borders of the

2254
03:03:53,391 --> 03:04:00,220
city, that had destroyed Ealing, might strike
among these houses and leave them smoking

2255
03:04:00,220 --> 03:04:02,140
ruins.

2256
03:04:02,140 --> 03:04:10,910
It was an empty city waiting for death...

2257
03:04:10,910 --> 03:04:16,920
In South Kensington the streets were clear
of dead people and of black powder, and near

2258
03:04:16,920 --> 03:04:20,650
there I first heard the howling.

2259
03:04:20,650 --> 03:04:23,550
It started very quietly.

2260
03:04:23,550 --> 03:04:35,181
It was a sad movement between two notes, 'Ulla,
ulla, ulla, ulla,' continuing without stopping.

2261
03:04:35,181 --> 03:04:42,021
When I passed streets that ran to the north
it grew louder, and then houses and buildings

2262
03:04:42,021 --> 03:04:44,391
seemed to cut it off again.

2263
03:04:44,391 --> 03:04:49,050
It came most loudly down Exhibition Road.

2264
03:04:49,050 --> 03:04:53,061
I stopped, staring towards Kensington Gardens.

2265
03:04:53,061 --> 03:04:59,660
It seemed that all the empty houses had found
a voice for their fear and loneliness.

2266
03:04:59,660 --> 03:05:10,000
'Ulla, ulla, ulla,' cried that inhuman note
- great waves of sound sweeping down the broad,

2267
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:15,311
sunlit road, between the tall buildings on
each side.

2268
03:05:15,311 --> 03:05:20,351
I turned to the north, towards the iron gates
of Hyde Park.

2269
03:05:20,351 --> 03:05:26,320
The voice grew stronger and stronger, although
I could see nothing above the roof-tops on

2270
03:05:26,320 --> 03:05:30,470
the north side of the park except some smoke
to the north-west.

2271
03:05:30,470 --> 03:05:39,840
'Ulla, ulla, ulla,' cried the voice, coming,
it seemed to me, from the district around

2272
03:05:39,840 --> 03:05:42,721
Regent's Park.

2273
03:05:42,721 --> 03:05:46,771
The howl affected my mind, and my mood changed.

2274
03:05:46,771 --> 03:05:53,970
I also found that I was very tired, and hungry
and thirsty again.

2275
03:05:53,970 --> 03:05:56,200
It was already past midday.

2276
03:05:56,200 --> 03:06:00,641
Why was I walking alone in this city of the
dead?

2277
03:06:00,641 --> 03:06:05,341
I thought of old friends that I had forgotten
for years.

2278
03:06:05,341 --> 03:06:12,140
I thought of the poisons in the chemists'
shops, the bottles in the wine shops...

2279
03:06:12,140 --> 03:06:18,010
I came into Oxford Street by Marble Arch,
and here again were black powder and several

2280
03:06:18,010 --> 03:06:20,140
bodies.

2281
03:06:20,140 --> 03:06:26,721
After a lot of trouble, I managed to break
into a pub and find some food and drink.

2282
03:06:26,721 --> 03:06:32,561
I was tired after eating and went into the
room behind the bar and slept on a black leather

2283
03:06:32,561 --> 03:06:35,720
sofa that I found there.

2284
03:06:35,720 --> 03:06:46,290
I awoke to find that sad howling still in
my ears: 'Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,' It

2285
03:06:46,290 --> 03:06:52,160
was now getting dark, and after I had found
some bread and cheese in the bar I walked

2286
03:06:52,160 --> 03:06:58,750
on through the silent squares to Baker Street
and so came at last to Regents Park.

2287
03:06:58,750 --> 03:07:06,061
And as I came out of the top of Baker Street,
I saw far away over the trees, in the clearness

2288
03:07:06,061 --> 03:07:13,490
of the sunset, the top of the Martian fighting-machine
from winch this howling came.

2289
03:07:13,490 --> 03:07:15,710
I was not frightened.

2290
03:07:15,710 --> 03:07:19,260
I watched it for some time, but it did not
move.

2291
03:07:19,260 --> 03:07:26,530
It appeared to be standing and calling, for
no reason that I could discover.

2292
03:07:26,530 --> 03:07:29,280
I tried to work out a plan of action.

2293
03:07:29,280 --> 03:07:37,780
That non-stop sound of 'Ulla, ulla, ulla,
ulla' confused my mind.

2294
03:07:37,780 --> 03:07:42,931
Perhaps I was too tired to be very afraid.

2295
03:07:42,931 --> 03:07:47,710
Certainly I was more curious to know the reason
for this howling.

2296
03:07:47,710 --> 03:07:53,410
I turned and went into Park Road, intending
to go round the edge of the park, with houses

2297
03:07:53,410 --> 03:08:00,080
between us to keep me safe, and get a view
of this unmoving, howling Martian from the

2298
03:08:00,080 --> 03:08:05,390
direction of St John's Wood.

2299
03:08:05,390 --> 03:08:11,311
I came to a destroyed building-machine halfway
to St John's Wood station.

2300
03:08:11,311 --> 03:08:16,771
At first I thought a house had fallen across
the road, but when I climbed up on the ruins

2301
03:08:16,771 --> 03:08:25,120
I saw, with a shock, this great machine lying,
with its tentacles bent and twisted, among

2302
03:08:25,120 --> 03:08:27,221
the ruins that it had made.

2303
03:08:27,221 --> 03:08:31,390
The front part of it was pushed in.

2304
03:08:31,390 --> 03:08:36,280
It seemed that it had been driven blindly
straight at the house, and had been turned

2305
03:08:36,280 --> 03:08:40,620
over when the house fell on it.

2306
03:08:40,620 --> 03:08:46,750
Wondering about all that I had seen, I moved
on towards Primrose Hill.

2307
03:08:46,750 --> 03:08:53,070
Far away, through a space in the trees, I
saw a second Martian fighting-machine, as

2308
03:08:53,070 --> 03:08:58,580
unmoving as the first, standing in the park
near the Zoo.

2309
03:08:58,580 --> 03:09:05,970
Then the sound of 'Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla'
stopped.

2310
03:09:05,970 --> 03:09:09,431
The silence came suddenly.

2311
03:09:09,431 --> 03:09:18,761
And now night, the mother of fear and mystery,
was coming.

2312
03:09:18,761 --> 03:09:22,580
London around me looked like a city of ghosts.

2313
03:09:22,580 --> 03:09:27,061
My imagination heard a thousand noiseless
enemies moving.

2314
03:09:27,061 --> 03:09:29,830
Terror came to me.

2315
03:09:29,830 --> 03:09:35,711
In front of me the road became black and I
saw the twisted shape of a body lying across

2316
03:09:35,711 --> 03:09:37,961
the pavement.

2317
03:09:37,961 --> 03:09:39,580
I could not go on.

2318
03:09:39,580 --> 03:09:47,271
I turned down St John's Wood Road and ran
away from this terrible stillness.

2319
03:09:47,271 --> 03:09:53,601
I hid from the night and the silence until
long after midnight, in a garden hut in Harrow

2320
03:09:53,601 --> 03:09:55,290
Road.

2321
03:09:55,290 --> 03:10:03,300
But before dawn my courage returned, and while
the stars were still in the sky I turned again

2322
03:10:03,300 --> 03:10:05,670
towards Regent's Park.

2323
03:10:05,670 --> 03:10:12,430
I lost my way among the streets, and soon
saw down a long road, in the half-light of

2324
03:10:12,430 --> 03:10:16,640
the early dawn, the curve of Primrose Hill.

2325
03:10:16,640 --> 03:10:24,280
There, on the top, high against the early
morning stars, was a third Martian, standing

2326
03:10:24,280 --> 03:10:26,680
still like the others.

2327
03:10:26,680 --> 03:10:30,450
A mad idea came to me.

2328
03:10:30,450 --> 03:10:33,120
I would die and end it.

2329
03:10:33,120 --> 03:10:37,210
And I would save myself even the trouble of
killing myself.

2330
03:10:37,210 --> 03:10:45,430
I marched on without fear towards this great
machine, and then, as I came nearer and the

2331
03:10:45,430 --> 03:10:51,661
light grew, I saw that a number of black birds
were circling and gathering around the top

2332
03:10:51,661 --> 03:10:52,920
of it.

2333
03:10:52,920 --> 03:11:00,290
I began to feel very happy and I started running
along the road.

2334
03:11:00,290 --> 03:11:03,971
I got onto the grass before the sun rose.

2335
03:11:03,971 --> 03:11:10,061
Great piles of earth had formed around a pit
at the top of the hill - the final and largest

2336
03:11:10,061 --> 03:11:17,960
one the Martians had made - and from behind
these piles thin smoke rose against the sky.

2337
03:11:17,960 --> 03:11:24,891
Against the sky-line an eager dog ran and
disappeared.

2338
03:11:24,891 --> 03:11:30,490
The thought that had flashed into my mind
grew real, and believable.

2339
03:11:30,490 --> 03:11:39,840
I felt no fear, only a wild, shaking excitement,
as I ran up the hill towards the unmoving

2340
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:41,100
Martian.

2341
03:11:41,100 --> 03:11:51,390
Out of the top of it hung long, brown pieces
of flesh, which the birds were tearing away.

2342
03:11:51,390 --> 03:11:56,840
In another moment I had climbed a pile of
earth and stood on its top, and the pit was

2343
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:58,980
below me.

2344
03:11:58,980 --> 03:12:06,601
It was a large space, with enormous machines
here and there within it, great piles of material

2345
03:12:06,601 --> 03:12:08,460
and strange buildings.

2346
03:12:08,460 --> 03:12:16,530
And all around it, some in their overturned
war-machines and some in building-machines,

2347
03:12:16,530 --> 03:12:22,221
and ten of them lying in a row, were the Martians
- dead!

2348
03:12:22,221 --> 03:12:32,071
They had been killed by germs against which
their systems could not fight; killed, after

2349
03:12:32,071 --> 03:12:43,570
all man's machines had failed, by the smallest
things that God has put on this Earth.

2350
03:12:43,570 --> 03:12:50,021
It had happened in this way, and I and many
others did not see that it would happen because

2351
03:12:50,021 --> 03:12:55,311
terror and disaster had blinded our minds.

2352
03:12:55,311 --> 03:13:02,320
These germs of disease have killed people
and animals since the beginning of time, but

2353
03:13:02,320 --> 03:13:08,230
over these many years we have developed the
ability to fight against them.

2354
03:13:08,230 --> 03:13:15,670
But there are no germs on Mars, and as soon
as the Martians arrived, as soon as they drank

2355
03:13:15,670 --> 03:13:20,840
and fed, our tiny friends began to destroy
them.

2356
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:29,771
By paying with a million lives, human beings
have bought their right to live on Earth.

2357
03:13:29,771 --> 03:13:35,681
It is our home and would be ours even if the
Martians were ten times as strong as they

2358
03:13:35,681 --> 03:13:37,610
are.

2359
03:13:37,610 --> 03:13:47,220
I stood staring into the pit, and my heart
grew wonderfully happy as the rising sun lit

2360
03:13:47,220 --> 03:13:49,311
up the world around me.

2361
03:13:49,311 --> 03:13:54,101
The pit was still in darkness.

2362
03:13:54,101 --> 03:14:00,080
Only the tops of the great engines, so unearthly
in their shape, could be seen in the morning

2363
03:14:00,080 --> 03:14:02,521
light.

2364
03:14:02,521 --> 03:14:07,521
I heard a large number of dogs fighting over
the bodies that lay in the darkness at the

2365
03:14:07,521 --> 03:14:09,830
bottom of the pit.

2366
03:14:09,830 --> 03:14:17,280
Across the pit, on its further edge, lay the
great flying-machine which they had been testing

2367
03:14:17,280 --> 03:14:23,230
in our heavier atmosphere when disease and
death stopped them.

2368
03:14:23,230 --> 03:14:27,771
Death had not come a day too soon.

2369
03:14:27,771 --> 03:14:33,760
At the sound of birds overhead I looked up
at the enormous fighting-machine that would

2370
03:14:33,760 --> 03:14:40,740
never fight again, at the pieces of red flesh
that dropped down onto the overturned seats

2371
03:14:40,740 --> 03:14:43,620
on the top of Primrose Hill.

2372
03:14:43,620 --> 03:14:50,440
I turned and looked down the slope of the
hill at those two other Martians that I had

2373
03:14:50,440 --> 03:14:53,460
seen the previous night.

2374
03:14:53,460 --> 03:14:56,130
They were surrounded by birds now.

2375
03:14:56,130 --> 03:15:01,771
One of them had died as it had been crying
to its friends.

2376
03:15:01,771 --> 03:15:10,760
Perhaps it was the last to die, and its voice
had gone on and on until its machinery stopped.

2377
03:15:10,760 --> 03:15:17,380
They stood now, harmless tripods of shining
metal, against the brightness of the rising

2378
03:15:17,380 --> 03:15:19,970
sun.

2379
03:15:19,970 --> 03:15:27,410
All around the pit, and saved from everlasting
destruction, lay the great city.

2380
03:15:27,410 --> 03:15:32,950
And as I looked at it, and realized that the
shadows had been rolled back, and that people

2381
03:15:32,950 --> 03:15:40,150
might still live in its streets, and that
this dear city of mine might be once more

2382
03:15:40,150 --> 03:15:51,181
alive and powerful again, I felt such emotion
that I was very close to tears.

2383
03:15:51,181 --> 03:15:55,200
The trouble had ended.

2384
03:15:55,200 --> 03:16:01,140
That same day the healing would begin.

2385
03:16:01,140 --> 03:16:06,610
People who were still alive would start to
return, and life would come back to the empty

2386
03:16:06,610 --> 03:16:08,450
streets.

2387
03:16:08,450 --> 03:16:14,341
The sound of tools would soon be heard in
all the burnt and broken houses.

2388
03:16:14,341 --> 03:16:21,650
At the thought, I lifted my hands towards
the sky and began thanking God.

2389
03:16:21,650 --> 03:16:29,561
In a year, I thought, we would rebuild all
that had been destroyed.

2390
03:16:29,561 --> 03:16:38,430
Then came the thought of myself, of my wife,
and the old life of hope and tender helpfulness

2391
03:16:38,430 --> 03:16:40,900
that had ended forever.

2392
03:16:40,900 --> 03:16:43,120
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

2393
03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:45,940
Wreckage

2394
03:16:45,940 --> 03:16:49,570
And now comes the strangest thing in my story.

2395
03:16:49,570 --> 03:16:53,940
But perhaps it is not totally strange.

2396
03:16:53,940 --> 03:17:00,470
I remember, clearly and in great detail, all
that I did that day until the time when I

2397
03:17:00,470 --> 03:17:04,670
stood crying on the top of Primrose Hill.

2398
03:17:04,670 --> 03:17:07,910
And then I forget.

2399
03:17:07,910 --> 03:17:13,670
I know nothing of the next three days.

2400
03:17:13,670 --> 03:17:19,540
I have learned since then that I was not the
first discoverer of the Martian defeat -several

2401
03:17:19,540 --> 03:17:24,350
wanderers like me had already known about
it on the previous night.

2402
03:17:24,350 --> 03:17:29,860
One man - the first - had even managed to
send a telegram to Paris.

2403
03:17:29,860 --> 03:17:35,780
From there the happy news had flashed all
over the world; a thousand cities, living

2404
03:17:35,780 --> 03:17:41,630
in great fear, suddenly- turned on all their
lights.

2405
03:17:41,630 --> 03:17:47,470
They knew of it in Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester
and Birmingham at the time when I stood on

2406
03:17:47,470 --> 03:17:49,980
the edge of the pit.

2407
03:17:49,980 --> 03:17:56,490
Already men, crying with joy, as I have heard,
were getting onto trains to go to London.

2408
03:17:56,490 --> 03:18:03,610
Men on bicycles rode through the countryside
shouting the news to all.

2409
03:18:03,610 --> 03:18:05,771
And the food!

2410
03:18:05,771 --> 03:18:12,230
Across the Channel, across the Irish Sea,
across the Atlantic, corn, bread and meat

2411
03:18:12,230 --> 03:18:14,390
were coming to us.

2412
03:18:14,390 --> 03:18:19,030
All the ships in the world seemed to be coming
to London in those days.

2413
03:18:19,030 --> 03:18:23,660
But I have no memory of all of this.

2414
03:18:23,660 --> 03:18:29,480
For three days I walked aimlessly, a madman.

2415
03:18:29,480 --> 03:18:33,610
Then I found myself in a house of kind people,
who had found me.

2416
03:18:33,610 --> 03:18:40,610
They have told me since that I was singing
a crazy song about 'The Last Man Left Alive!

2417
03:18:40,610 --> 03:18:44,670
The Last Man Left Alive!'

2418
03:18:44,670 --> 03:18:49,160
Although they were troubled with their own
affairs, these people were very helpful to

2419
03:18:49,160 --> 03:18:50,160
me.

2420
03:18:50,160 --> 03:18:56,390
They gave me a place to stay and protected
me from myself.

2421
03:18:56,390 --> 03:19:01,551
Very gently, when my mind was working again,
they told me all they knew about what had

2422
03:19:01,551 --> 03:19:04,680
happened in Leatherhead.

2423
03:19:04,680 --> 03:19:11,970
Two days after I was imprisoned it had been
destroyed, with every person in it, by a Martian.

2424
03:19:11,970 --> 03:19:16,980
He had swept it all away for no reason at
all, it seemed.

2425
03:19:16,980 --> 03:19:21,580
I was a lonely man, and they were very kind
to me.

2426
03:19:21,580 --> 03:19:26,221
I was a sad one too, and they were patient
with me.

2427
03:19:26,221 --> 03:19:31,890
I stayed with them for four days after my
recovery.

2428
03:19:31,890 --> 03:19:37,100
All that time I felt a growing need to look
again at whatever remained of the little life

2429
03:19:37,100 --> 03:19:42,671
that had seemed so happy and bright in my
past.

2430
03:19:42,671 --> 03:19:49,440
My hosts tried to change my mind but at last,
promising faithfully to return to them, I

2431
03:19:49,440 --> 03:19:59,510
went out again into the streets that had lately
been so dark and strange and empty.

2432
03:19:59,510 --> 03:20:06,561
Already they were busy with returning people;
in places there were even shops open.

2433
03:20:06,561 --> 03:20:12,030
I remember how bright that day seemed as I
went sadly back to the little house in Woking

2434
03:20:12,030 --> 03:20:16,900
- how busy the streets were, and how full
of life.

2435
03:20:16,900 --> 03:20:23,750
But then I noticed how ill the people looked
and how many of them still wore old and dirty

2436
03:20:23,750 --> 03:20:25,620
clothes.

2437
03:20:25,620 --> 03:20:30,480
The churches were giving out bread sent to
us by the French government, and tired-looking

2438
03:20:30,480 --> 03:20:34,061
policemen stood at the corners of every street.

2439
03:20:34,061 --> 03:20:41,521
At the end of Waterloo Bridge I bought a copy
of the first newspaper to reappear.

2440
03:20:41,521 --> 03:20:47,351
I learned nothing new except that already
in one week the examination of the Martians'

2441
03:20:47,351 --> 03:20:50,730
machines had produced amazing results.

2442
03:20:50,730 --> 03:20:56,851
Among other things, the newspaper said that
the 'Secret of Flying' had been discovered.

2443
03:20:56,851 --> 03:20:59,420
I did not believe this at the time.

2444
03:20:59,420 --> 03:21:03,852
At Waterloo I found that free trains were
taking people to their homes.

2445
03:21:03,852 --> 03:21:10,021
The first rush had already ended and there
were few people on the train.

2446
03:21:10,021 --> 03:21:15,530
The city we went through was dirty with the
powder of the Black Smoke, despite two days

2447
03:21:15,530 --> 03:21:19,250
of thunderstorms and rain.

2448
03:21:19,250 --> 03:21:23,771
All down the line from there, the country
looked empty and unfamiliar.

2449
03:21:23,771 --> 03:21:31,150
Wimbledon particularly had suffered, and beyond
there I saw piles of earth around the sixth

2450
03:21:31,150 --> 03:21:33,101
cylinder.

2451
03:21:33,101 --> 03:21:38,851
A number of people were standing by it, and
some soldiers were busy in the middle.

2452
03:21:38,851 --> 03:21:43,150
Over it was a British flag, flying cheerfully
in the wind.

2453
03:21:43,150 --> 03:21:49,630
The line on the London side of Woking station
was still being repaired, so I got off the

2454
03:21:49,630 --> 03:21:55,930
train at Byfleet and took the road to Maybury,
past the place where I had seen the Martian

2455
03:21:55,930 --> 03:21:58,100
fighting- machine in the thunderstorm.

2456
03:21:58,100 --> 03:22:05,141
I was curious and I stopped to find the twisted
and broken dog-cart with the whitened bones

2457
03:22:05,141 --> 03:22:07,430
of the horse.

2458
03:22:07,430 --> 03:22:12,180
For a time I stood and looked at the remains...

2459
03:22:12,180 --> 03:22:15,250
Then I returned through the wood towards my
home.

2460
03:22:15,250 --> 03:22:21,590
A man standing at the open door of a house
greeted me by name as I passed.

2461
03:22:21,590 --> 03:22:27,390
I looked at my own house with a quick flash
of hope that died immediately.

2462
03:22:27,390 --> 03:22:31,580
The door had been broken, and it was opening
slowly as I approached.

2463
03:22:31,580 --> 03:22:34,690
It blew shut again.

2464
03:22:34,690 --> 03:22:40,170
The curtains of my study blew out of the open
window from which I and the soldier had watched

2465
03:22:40,170 --> 03:22:42,410
the dawn.

2466
03:22:42,410 --> 03:22:45,771
No one had closed it since then.

2467
03:22:45,771 --> 03:22:48,771
I went into the hall, and the house felt empty.

2468
03:22:48,771 --> 03:22:54,850
The stair carpet was discolored where I had
sat, wet to the skin from the thunderstorm

2469
03:22:54,850 --> 03:22:57,980
on that first terrible night.

2470
03:22:57,980 --> 03:23:01,730
Our muddy footsteps still went up the stairs.

2471
03:23:01,730 --> 03:23:08,021
I followed them to my study and found, lying
on my writing- table, the page of work I had

2472
03:23:08,021 --> 03:23:11,450
left on the afternoon of the opening of the
cylinder.

2473
03:23:11,450 --> 03:23:16,180
For some time I stood reading it.

2474
03:23:16,180 --> 03:23:22,350
I remembered how I could not concentrate that
morning, hardly a month before, and how I

2475
03:23:22,350 --> 03:23:27,350
had stopped work to get my newspaper from
the newsboy.

2476
03:23:27,350 --> 03:23:32,980
I remembered how I went to the garden gate
as he came past, and how I had listened to

2477
03:23:32,980 --> 03:23:38,091
his odd story of 'Men from Mars'.

2478
03:23:38,091 --> 03:23:41,391
I came down and went into the dining-room.

2479
03:23:41,391 --> 03:23:48,230
There were the remains of the meat and the
bread, now gone bad, where the soldier and

2480
03:23:48,230 --> 03:23:50,860
I had left them.

2481
03:23:50,860 --> 03:23:54,761
My home was a lonely place.

2482
03:23:54,761 --> 03:24:01,480
I realized the stupidity of the small hope
I had held on to for so long.

2483
03:24:01,480 --> 03:24:04,480
And then a strange thing happened.

2484
03:24:04,480 --> 03:24:09,970
'The house is deserted,' said a voice.

2485
03:24:09,970 --> 03:24:12,771
'No one has been here for ten days.

2486
03:24:12,771 --> 03:24:16,980
Don't stay here and make yourself unhappy.

2487
03:24:16,980 --> 03:24:19,771
No one escaped except you.'

2488
03:24:19,771 --> 03:24:22,771
I was shocked.

2489
03:24:22,771 --> 03:24:26,360
Had I spoken my thought aloud?

2490
03:24:26,360 --> 03:24:32,891
I turned, and the door to the garden was open
behind me.

2491
03:24:32,891 --> 03:24:37,470
I took a step towards it and stood looking
out.

2492
03:24:37,470 --> 03:24:46,261
And there, amazed and afraid, as I too stood
amazed and afraid, were my cousin and my wife

2493
03:24:46,261 --> 03:24:53,131
- my wife white and tearless.

2494
03:24:53,131 --> 03:24:55,180
She gave a faint cry.

2495
03:24:55,180 --> 03:25:00,360
'I came here,' she said.

2496
03:25:00,360 --> 03:25:08,280
'I knew-knew -' She put her hand to her throat
and started to fall.

2497
03:25:08,280 --> 03:25:17,830
I stepped forwards and caught her in my arms.

2498
03:25:17,830 --> 03:25:23,590
I can only regret now, as I finish my story,
how little I can help with the many questions

2499
03:25:23,590 --> 03:25:25,760
which are still unanswered.

2500
03:25:25,760 --> 03:25:30,030
In one area I shall certainly be criticized.

2501
03:25:30,030 --> 03:25:37,940
I know very little about medical matters,
but it seems to me most likely that the Martians

2502
03:25:37,940 --> 03:25:40,050
were killed by germs.

2503
03:25:40,050 --> 03:25:46,430
Certainly, in all the bodies of the Martians
that were examined after the war, no germs

2504
03:25:46,430 --> 03:25:50,561
were found except ones that came from Earth.

2505
03:25:50,561 --> 03:25:58,290
Besides this, we still know very little about
the Black Smoke, and the way that the Heat-Ray

2506
03:25:58,290 --> 03:26:01,170
worked remains a puzzle.

2507
03:26:01,170 --> 03:26:08,551
A question of more serious interest is the
possibility of another attack from the Martians.

2508
03:26:08,551 --> 03:26:13,440
I do not think that nearly enough attention
is being paid to this.

2509
03:26:13,440 --> 03:26:20,550
Every time the planet Mars comes near to us,
I worry that they might try again.

2510
03:26:20,550 --> 03:26:22,450
We should be prepared.

2511
03:26:22,450 --> 03:26:28,860
It should be possible to find the position
of the gun from which the shots came, to watch

2512
03:26:28,860 --> 03:26:33,931
this part of the planet carefully and be ready.

2513
03:26:33,931 --> 03:26:39,471
In that case, the cylinder could be destroyed
before it was cool enough for the Martians

2514
03:26:39,471 --> 03:26:45,800
to come out, or they could be killed by guns
as soon as the door opened.

2515
03:26:45,800 --> 03:26:53,840
It seems to me that they have lost a great
advantage in the failure of their first surprise.

2516
03:26:53,840 --> 03:26:58,290
Possibly they also believe this.

2517
03:26:58,290 --> 03:27:03,530
One astronomer has given excellent reasons
for supposing that the Martians have actually

2518
03:27:03,530 --> 03:27:06,690
landed on Venus.

2519
03:27:06,690 --> 03:27:12,970
Seven months ago, when these planets were
close together, faint, dark marks appeared

2520
03:27:12,970 --> 03:27:20,271
on photographs which suggested that a cylinder
had been fired from one to the other.

2521
03:27:20,271 --> 03:27:27,590
However, whether we expect another attack
or not, our views of the human future must

2522
03:27:27,590 --> 03:27:31,631
now be changed by these events.

2523
03:27:31,631 --> 03:27:38,271
We have learned that we cannot think of this
planet as a safe home for humans.

2524
03:27:38,271 --> 03:27:46,940
We can never know what unseen good or evil
might come to us suddenly out of space.

2525
03:27:46,940 --> 03:27:51,050
Perhaps this attack from Mars will be helpful
to us in the end.

2526
03:27:51,050 --> 03:27:58,230
It has taken away our confidence in the future,
which was making us soft; it has given great

2527
03:27:58,230 --> 03:28:07,470
help to science, and it has made us think
of human beings as one family.

2528
03:28:07,470 --> 03:28:15,880
Perhaps, across the great distances of space,
the Martians have watched what happened to

2529
03:28:15,880 --> 03:28:21,970
the ones that landed on Earth and learned
their lesson - and have found a safer home

2530
03:28:21,970 --> 03:28:25,181
on the planet Venus.

2531
03:28:25,181 --> 03:28:31,561
Even if that is true, for many years we will
continue to watch Mars carefully, and all

2532
03:28:31,561 --> 03:28:35,880
falling stars will make us afraid.

2533
03:28:35,880 --> 03:28:41,431
The war has broadened people's minds enormously.

2534
03:28:41,431 --> 03:28:47,480
Before it there was a general belief that
there was no life in space apart from on our

2535
03:28:47,480 --> 03:28:49,610
tiny planet.

2536
03:28:49,610 --> 03:28:56,440
If the Martians can reach Venus, there is
no reason to think that this is impossible

2537
03:28:56,440 --> 03:28:57,440
for us.

2538
03:28:57,440 --> 03:29:03,061
So when the slow cooling of the sun means
that we cannot continue to live on Earth,

2539
03:29:03,061 --> 03:29:08,980
it may be that life which began here can reach
out and continue there.

2540
03:29:08,980 --> 03:29:13,521
But that is a distant dream.

2541
03:29:13,521 --> 03:29:18,370
We may, on the other hand, still be destroyed
by the Martians.

2542
03:29:18,370 --> 03:29:24,391
The future may belong to them and not to us.

2543
03:29:24,391 --> 03:29:31,021
I must admit that the trouble and danger of
our time have left a continuing sense of doubt

2544
03:29:31,021 --> 03:29:33,960
and fear in my mind.

2545
03:29:33,960 --> 03:29:42,021
I sit in my study writing by lamplight, and
suddenly I see the valley below on fire again,

2546
03:29:42,021 --> 03:29:47,221
and feel that the house around me is empty
and lonely.

2547
03:29:47,221 --> 03:29:54,561
I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles
pass me, a boy on a bicycle, children going

2548
03:29:54,561 --> 03:30:02,930
to school - and suddenly they become strange
and unreal, and I hurry on again with the

2549
03:30:02,930 --> 03:30:06,311
soldier through the hot, dangerous silence.

2550
03:30:06,311 --> 03:30:13,110
At night I see the black powder-darkening
the silent streets, and the twisted bodies

2551
03:30:13,110 --> 03:30:14,760
covered by it.

2552
03:30:14,760 --> 03:30:18,211
They stand up in front of me, torn and dog-bitten.

2553
03:30:18,211 --> 03:30:30,950
They talk and grow angry, paler, uglier, and
I wake, cold and shaking, in the darkness.

2554
03:30:30,950 --> 03:30:37,950
I go to London and see the busy crowds in
Fleet Street and the Strand, and it comes

2555
03:30:37,950 --> 03:30:43,820
to my mind that they are just the ghosts of
the past, walking the streets that I have

2556
03:30:43,820 --> 03:30:50,461
seen silent and empty, spirits in a dead city.

2557
03:30:50,461 --> 03:30:56,550
And it is strange, too, to stand on Primrose
Hill, as I did only a day before writing this

2558
03:30:56,550 --> 03:30:59,370
last chapter.

2559
03:30:59,370 --> 03:31:06,660
I saw the houses stretching away and disappearing
into the smoke and mist, people walking up

2560
03:31:06,660 --> 03:31:12,181
and down between the flower-beds, and the
sightseers around the Martian machine that

2561
03:31:12,181 --> 03:31:15,101
still stands there.

2562
03:31:15,101 --> 03:31:21,440
I heard the noise of playing children and
remembered the deep silence of the dawn of

2563
03:31:21,440 --> 03:31:26,070
that last great day...

2564
03:31:26,070 --> 03:31:33,271
And it is strangest of all to hold my wife's
hand again, and to think that I have thought

2565
03:31:33,271 --> 03:31:39,141
of her, and that she has thought of me, among
the dead.
