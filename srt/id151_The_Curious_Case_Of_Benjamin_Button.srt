CHAPTER ONE
 

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,720
As long ago as 1860 it was the 
proper thing to be born at home.  

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,240
At present, so I am told, the high gods of 
medicine have decreed that the first cries  

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,520
of the young shall be uttered upon the anaesthetic 
air of a hospital, preferably a fashionable one.  

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,160
So young Mr. and Mrs. Roger Button were fifty 
years ahead of style when they decided, one day in  

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,800
the summer of 1860, that their first baby should 
be born in a hospital. Whether this anachronism  

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,240
had any bearing upon the astonishing history 
I am about to set down will never be known.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,240
I shall tell you what occurred, 
and let you judge for yourself.

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,920
The Roger Buttons held an enviable position, both 
social and financial, in ante - bellum Baltimore.  

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,400
They were related to the This Family and the 
That Family, which, as every Southerner knew,  

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,520
entitled them to membership in that enormous 
peerage which largely populated the Confederacy.  

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,080
This was their first experience with 
the charming old custom of having  

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,440
babies - Mr. Button was naturally 
nervous. He hoped it would be a boy  

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,760
so that he could be sent to Yale College 
in Connecticut, at which institution Mr.  

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,880
Button himself had been known for four years 
by the somewhat obvious nickname of "Cuff."

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,760
On the September morning consecrated to the 
enormous event he arose nervously at six o'clock  

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,280
dressed himself, adjusted an impeccable stock, and 
hurried forth through the streets of Baltimore to  

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,840
the hospital, to determine whether the darkness 
of the night had borne in new life upon its bosom.

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,160
When he was approximately a hundred yards 
from the Maryland Private Hospital for  

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,080
Ladies and Gentlemen he saw Doctor Keene, the 
family physician, descending the front steps,  

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,040
rubbing his hands together 
with a washing movement - as  

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,800
all doctors are required to do by the 
unwritten ethics of their profession.

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,800
Mr. Roger Button, the president 
of Roger Button & Co.,  

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,960
Wholesale Hardware, began to run 
toward Doctor Keene with much less  

25
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,200
dignity than was expected from a Southern 
gentleman of that picturesque period.

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
"Doctor Keene!" he called. "Oh, Doctor Keene!"

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,320
The doctor heard him, faced 
around, and stood waiting,  

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,520
a curious expression settling on his harsh, 
medicinal face as Mr. Button drew near.

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,040
"What happened?" demanded Mr. Button, 
as he came up in a gasping rush.  

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,640
"What was it? How is she" 
A boy? Who is it? What -"

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,800
"Talk sense!" said Doctor Keene 
sharply, He appeared somewhat irritated.

32
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,880
"Is the child born?" begged Mr. Button.

33
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,040
Doctor Keene frowned.  

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,560
"Why, yes, I suppose so - after a fashion." 
Again he threw a curious glance at Mr. Button.

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,880
"Is my wife all right?"

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,080
"Yes."

37
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,320
"Is it a boy or a girl?"

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,880
"Here now!" cried Doctor Keene in a perfect 
passion of irritation, "I'll ask you to go  

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,640
and see for yourself. Outrageous!" He snapped 
the last word out in almost one syllable, then  

40
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,840
he turned away muttering: "Do you imagine a case 
like this will help my professional reputation?  

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,200
One more would ruin me - ruin anybody."

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,360
"What's the matter?" demanded 
Mr. Button appalled. "Triplets?"

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,840
"No, not triplets!" answered the doctor cuttingly. 
"What's more, you can go and see for yourself.  

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,440
And get another doctor. I brought 
you into the world, young man,  

45
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,960
and I've been physician to 
your family for forty years,  

46
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,200
but I'm through with you! I don't want to see you 
or any of your relatives ever again! Good - bye!"

47
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,520
Then he turned sharply, and 
without another word climbed  

48
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,840
into his phaeton, which was waiting at 
the curbstone, and drove severely away.

49
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,760
Mr. Button stood there upon the sidewalk, 
stupefied and trembling from head to foot.  

50
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,960
What horrible mishap had occurred? He had suddenly 
lost all desire to go into the Maryland Private  

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,440
Hospital for Ladies and Gentlemen - it 
was with the greatest difficulty that,  

52
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,760
a moment later, he forced himself to 
mount the steps and enter the front door.

53
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,000
A nurse was sitting behind a desk 
in the opaque gloom of the hall.  

54
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,840
Swallowing his shame, Mr. Button approached her.

55
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,520
"Good - morning," she remarked, 
looking up at him pleasantly.

56
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,800
"Good - morning. I - I am Mr. Button."

57
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,520
At this a look of utter terror spread itself 
over girl's face. She rose to her feet and  

58
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,560
seemed about to fly from the hall, restraining 
herself only with the most apparent difficulty.

59
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
"I want to see my child," said Mr. Button.

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,640
The nurse gave a little scream. "Oh - of 
course!" she cried hysterically. "Upstairs.  

61
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,600
Right upstairs. Go - up!"

62
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,240
She pointed the direction, and Mr. Button, 
bathed in cool perspiration, turned falteringly,  

63
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,960
and began to mount to the second floor. In 
the upper hall he addressed another nurse who  

64
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,960
approached him, basin in hand. "I'm Mr. Button," 
he managed to articulate. "I want to see my -"

65
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,440
Clank! The basin clattered to the floor and rolled 
in the direction of the stairs. Clank! Clank! I  

66
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,080
began a methodical decent as if sharing in the 
general terror which this gentleman provoked.

67
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,320
"I want to see my child!" Mr. Button almost 
shrieked. He was on the verge of collapse.

68
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,120
Clank! The basin reached the first floor. 
The nurse regained control of herself,  

69
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,520
and threw Mr. Button a look of hearty contempt.

70
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,840
"All right, Mr. Button," she 
agreed in a hushed voice.  

71
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,440
"Very well! But if you knew what a state it's put 
us all in this morning! It's perfectly outrageous!  

72
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,440
The hospital will never have a 
ghost of a reputation after -"

73
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,840
"Hurry!" he cried hoarsely. "I can't stand this!"

74
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,920
"Come this way, then, Mr. Button."

75
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,200
He dragged himself after her. At the 
end of a long hall they reached a room  

76
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,400
from which proceeded a variety of howls - 
indeed, a room which, in later parlance,  

77
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,000
would have been known as the 
"crying - room." They entered.

78
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,640
Ranged around the walls were half a 
dozen white - enameled rolling cribs,  

79
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,560
each with a tag tied at the head.

80
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,240
"Well," gasped Mr. Button, "which is mine?"

81
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,760
"There!" said the nurse.

82
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,880
Mr. Button's eyes followed her pointing finger, 
and this is what he saw. Wrapped in a voluminous  

83
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,520
white blanket, and partly crammed into one of 
the cribs, there sat an old man apparently about  

84
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,200
seventy years of age. His sparse hair was 
almost white, and from his chin dripped a  

85
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,200
long smoke - coloured beard, which waved absurdly 
back and forth, fanned by the breeze coming in at  

86
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:07,840
the window. He looked up at Mr. Button with dim, 
faded eyes in which lurked a puzzled question.

87
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,960
"Am I mad?" thundered Mr. Button,  

88
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,680
his terror resolving into rage. "Is 
this some ghastly hospital joke?

89
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,200
"It doesn't seem like a joke to us," 
replied the nurse severely. "And I  

90
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,440
don't know whether you're mad or not - 
but that is most certainly your child."

91
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:35,280
The cool perspiration redoubled on Mr. Button's 
forehead. He closed his eyes, and then, opening  

92
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:43,520
them, looked again. There was no mistake - he was 
gazing at a man of threescore and ten - a baby of  

93
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,680
threescore and ten, a baby whose feet hung over 
the sides of the crib in which it was reposing.

94
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,800
The old man looked placidly from 
one to the other for a moment,  

95
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:02,480
and then suddenly spoke in a cracked and 
ancient voice. "Are you my father?" he demanded.

96
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,920
Mr. Button and the nurse started violently.

97
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,280
"Because if you are," went on the old man 
querulously, "I wish you'd get me out of  

98
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,440
this place - or, at least, get them 
to put a comfortable rocker in here,"

99
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,760
"Where in God's name did you come from? Who 
are you?" burst out Mr. Button frantically.

100
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,200
"I can't tell you exactly who I 
am," replied the querulous whine,  

101
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,320
"because I've only been born a few hours 
- but my last name is certainly Button."

102
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,360
"You lie! You're an impostor!"

103
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,120
The old man turned wearily to 
the nurse. "Nice way to welcome  

104
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,880
a new - born child," he complained in a weak 
voice. "Tell him he's wrong, why don't you?"

105
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,840
"You're wrong. Mr. Button," said the 
nurse severely. "This is your child,  

106
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,760
and you'll have to make the best 
of it. We're going to ask you to  

107
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,120
take him home with you as soon as 
possible - some time to - day."

108
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,600
"Home?" repeated Mr. Button incredulously.

109
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,120
"Yes, we can't have him here. 
We really can't, you know?"

110
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,640
"I'm right glad of it," whined the old man. 
"This is a fine place to keep a youngster of  

111
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,840
quiet tastes. With all this yelling and howling, 
I haven't been able to get a wink of sleep.  

112
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,160
I asked for something to eat" - here 
his voice rose to a shrill note of  

113
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,840
protest - "and they brought me a bottle of milk!"

114
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,240
Mr. Button sank down upon a chair near his 
son and concealed his face in his hands.  

115
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:47,040
"My heavens!" he murmured, in an ecstasy of 
horror. "What will people say? What must I do?"

116
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,760
"You'll have to take him home," 
insisted the nurse - "immediately!"

117
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,120
A grotesque picture formed itself with 
dreadful clarity before the eyes of the  

118
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,240
tortured man - a picture of himself walking 
through the crowded streets of the city with  

119
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:10,400
this appalling apparition stalking by 
his side. "I can't. I can't," he moaned.

120
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,480
People would stop to speak to him, and what 
was he going to say? He would have to introduce  

121
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,600
this - this septuagenarian: "This is my son, 
born early this morning." And then the old  

122
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,560
man would gather his blanket around him and 
they would plod on, past the bustling stores,  

123
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,640
the slave market - for a dark instant Mr. Button 
wished passionately that his son was black - past  

124
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,440
the luxurious houses of the residential 
district, past the home for the aged...

125
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,440
"Come! Pull yourself 
together," commanded the nurse.

126
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,760
"See here," the old man announced suddenly,  

127
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,160
"if you think I'm going to walk home in 
this blanket, you're entirely mistaken."

128
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,800
"Babies always have blankets."

129
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,840
With a malicious crackle the old man 
held up a small white swaddling garment.  

130
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,480
"Look!" he quavered. "This is 
what they had ready for me."

131
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,560
"Babies always wear those," said the nurse primly.

132
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,120
"Well," said the old man, "this baby's not 
going to wear anything in about two minutes.  

133
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,560
This blanket itches. They might 
at least have given me a sheet."

134
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,080
"Keep it on! Keep it on!" said Mr. Button 
hurriedly. He turned to the nurse. "What'll I do?"

135
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,080
"Go down town and buy your son some clothes."

136
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,920
Mr. Button's son's voice 
followed him down into the: hall:  

137
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,840
"And a cane, father. I want to have a cane."

138
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,240
Mr. Button banged the outer door savagely...
 
 

139
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,880
CHAPTER TWO
 

140
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,920
"Good - morning," Mr. Button said nervously, to 
the clerk in the Chesapeake Dry Goods Company.  

141
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,640
"I want to buy some clothes for my child."

142
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,280
"How old is your child, sir?"

143
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,640
"About six hours," answered Mr. 
Button, without due consideration.

144
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,200
"Babies' supply department in the rear."

145
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,840
"Why, I don't think - I'm not sure that's what I 
want. It's - he's an unusually large - size child.  

146
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
Exceptionally - ah large."

147
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,240
"They have the largest child's sizes."

148
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,560
"Where is the boys' department?" inquired 
Mr. Button, shifting his ground desperately.  

149
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,840
He felt that the clerk must 
surely scent his shameful secret.

150
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,600
"Right here."

151
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,240
"Well -" He hesitated. The notion of dressing 
his son in men's clothes was repugnant to him.  

152
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,280
If, say, he could only find a very large boy's 
suit, he might cut off that long and awful beard,  

153
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,760
dye the white hair brown, and thus 
manage to conceal the worst, and to  

154
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,320
retain something of his own self - respect - not 
to mention his position in Baltimore society.

155
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,440
But a frantic inspection of the boys' department 
revealed no suits to fit the new - born Button.  

156
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,880
He blamed the store, of course - in such 
cases it is the thing to blame the store.

157
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,560
"How old did you say that boy of yours 
was?" demanded the clerk curiously.

158
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,800
"He's - sixteen."

159
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,960
"Oh, I beg your pardon. I 
thought you said six hours.  

160
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,000
You'll find the youths' 
department in the next aisle."

161
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,720
Mr. Button turned miserably away. Then he stopped,  

162
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,120
brightened, and pointed his finger toward 
a dressed dummy in the window display.  

163
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,880
"There!" he exclaimed. "I'll take 
that suit, out there on the dummy."

164
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,920
The clerk stared. "Why," he 
protested, "that's not a child's suit.  

165
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,240
At least it is, but it's for fancy 
dress. You could wear it yourself!"

166
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,800
"Wrap it up," insisted his customer 
nervously. "That's what I want."

167
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,360
The astonished clerk obeyed.

168
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,720
Back at the hospital Mr. Button entered the 
nursery and almost threw the package at his son.  

169
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,280
"Here's your clothes," he snapped out.

170
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,840
The old man untied the package and 
viewed the contents with a quizzical eye.

171
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,680
"They look sort of funny to me," he complained, 
"I don't want to be made a monkey of -"

172
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,600
"You've made a monkey of me!" retorted Mr. Button 
fiercely. "Never you mind how funny you look.  

173
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,400
Put them on - or I'll - or I'll spank you." 
He swallowed uneasily at the penultimate word,  

174
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,280
feeling nevertheless that it 
was the proper thing to say.

175
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,080
"All right, father" - this with a grotesque  

176
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,840
simulation of filial respect - "you've lived 
longer; you know best. Just as you say."

177
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,520
As before, the sound of the word "father" 
caused Mr. Button to start violently.

178
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,240
"And hurry."

179
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,680
"I'm hurrying, father."

180
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,240
When his son was dressed Mr. Button 
regarded him with depression.  

181
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,600
The costume consisted of dotted socks, pink pants, 
and a belted blouse with a wide white collar. Over  

182
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,840
the latter waved the long whitish beard, drooping 
almost to the waist. The effect was not good.

183
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,120
"Wait!"

184
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,000
Mr. Button seized a hospital shears and with 
three quick snaps amputated a large section  

185
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,920
of the beard. But even with this improvement 
the ensemble fell far short of perfection. The  

186
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,600
remaining brush of scraggly hair, the watery 
eyes, the ancient teeth, seemed oddly out of  

187
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,520
tone with the gaiety of the costume. Mr. Button, 
however, was obdurate - he held out his hand.  

188
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
"Come along!" he said sternly.

189
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,760
His son took the hand trustingly. "What are 
you going to call me, dad?" he quavered as  

190
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,680
they walked from the nursery - "just 'baby' 
for a while? till you think of a better name?"

191
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:54,160
Mr. Button grunted. "I don't know," he answered 
harshly. "I think we'll call you Methuselah."
 
 

192
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,800
CHAPTER THREE
 

193
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,640
Even after the new addition to the 
Button family had had his hair cut  

194
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:05,280
short and then dyed to a sparse unnatural black, 
had had his face shaved so dose that it glistened,  

195
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,040
and had been attired in small - boy clothes 
made to order by a flabbergasted tailor,  

196
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,840
it was impossible for Button to ignore the fact 
that his son was a excuse for a first family baby.  

197
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:24,480
Despite his aged stoop, Benjamin Button 
- for it was by this name they called him  

198
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,240
instead of by the appropriate but invidious 
Methuselah - was five feet eight inches tall.  

199
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,400
His clothes did not conceal this, nor did the 
clipping and dyeing of his eyebrows disguise  

200
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,640
the fact that the eyes under - were faded and 
watery and tired. In fact, the baby - nurse who  

201
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,560
had been engaged in advance left the house after 
one look, in a state of considerable indignation.

202
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,760
But Mr. Button persisted in his unwavering 
purpose. Benjamin was a baby, and a baby he should  

203
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,960
remain. At first he declared that if Benjamin 
didn't like warm milk he could go without food  

204
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:07,120
altogether, but he was finally prevailed upon to 
allow his son bread and butter, and even oatmeal  

205
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,520
by way of a compromise. One day he brought home 
a rattle and, giving it to Benjamin, insisted in  

206
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,640
no uncertain terms that he should "play with 
it," whereupon the old man took it with - a  

207
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,680
weary expression and could be heard jingling 
it obediently at intervals throughout the day.

208
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,160
There can be no doubt, though, 
that the rattle bored him,  

209
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,840
and that he found other and more soothing 
amusements when he was left alone.  

210
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,360
For instance, Mr. Button discovered one day 
that during the preceding week be had smoked  

211
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,120
more cigars than ever before - a phenomenon, 
which was explained a few days later when,  

212
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,040
entering the nursery unexpectedly, he found 
the room full of faint blue haze and Benjamin,  

213
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,960
with a guilty expression on his face, trying 
to conceal the butt of a dark Havana.This,  

214
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,240
of course, called for a severe spanking, but 
Mr. Button found that he could not bring himself  

215
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,280
to administer it. He merely warned his 
son that he would "stunt his growth."

216
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,200
Nevertheless he persisted in his attitude. He 
brought home lead soldiers, he brought toy trains,  

217
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,080
he brought large pleasant animals made of 
cotton, and, to perfect the illusion which  

218
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,800
he was creating - for himself at least - he 
passionately demanded of the clerk in the  

219
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,840
toy - store whether "the paint would come oft 
the pink duck if the baby put it in his mouth."  

220
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,480
But, despite all his father's efforts, Benjamin 
refused to be interested. He would steal down  

221
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,240
the back stairs and return to the nursery with a 
volume of the Encyclopedia Britannica, over which  

222
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,000
he would pore through an afternoon, while his 
cotton cows and his Noah's ark were left neglected  

223
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,600
on the floor. Against such a stubbornness 
Mr. Button's efforts were of little avail.

224
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,400
The sensation created in Baltimore was, 
at first, prodigious. What the mishap  

225
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,560
would have cost the Buttons and their 
kinsfolk socially cannot be determined,  

226
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,160
for the outbreak of the Civil War drew the city's 
attention to other things. A few people who  

227
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,440
were unfailingly polite racked their brains for 
compliments to give to the parents - and finally  

228
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,880
hit upon the ingenious device of declaring 
that the baby resembled his grandfather,  

229
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,480
a fact which, due to the standard state of decay 
common to all men of seventy, could not be denied.  

230
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,680
Mr. and Mrs. Roger Button were not pleased, and 
Benjamin's grandfather was furiously insulted.

231
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,400
Benjamin, once he left the 
hospital, took life as he found it.  

232
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,000
Several small boys were brought to see him, and 
he spent a stiff - jointed afternoon trying to  

233
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,760
work up an interest in tops and marbles - he 
even managed, quite accidentally, to break a  

234
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,600
kitchen window with a stone from a sling shot, 
a feat which secretly delighted his father.

235
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,440
Thereafter Benjamin contrived to break 
something every day, but he did these  

236
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,160
things only because they were expected of 
him, and because he was by nature obliging.

237
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,760
When his grandfather's 
initial antagonism wore off,  

238
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,000
Benjamin and that gentleman took enormous 
pleasure in one another's company.  

239
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,480
They would sit for hours, these two, so far apart 
in age and experience, and, like old cronies,  

240
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,560
discuss with tireless monotony the slow events 
of the day. Benjamin felt more at ease in his  

241
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,480
grandfather's presence than in his parents' - 
they seemed always somewhat in awe of him and,  

242
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,160
despite the dictatorial authority they exercised 
over him, frequently addressed him as "Mr."

243
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,320
He was as puzzled as any one else at the 
apparently advanced age of his mind and  

244
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,320
body at birth. He read up on it in the medical 
journal, but found that no such case had been  

245
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,400
previously recorded. At his father's urging he 
made an honest attempt to play with other boys,  

246
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,360
and frequently he joined in the milder 
games - football shook him up too much,  

247
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,600
and he feared that in case of a fracture 
his ancient bones would refuse to knit.

248
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,640
When he was five he was sent to kindergarten, 
where he initiated into the art of pasting green  

249
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,200
paper on orange paper, of weaving coloured maps 
and manufacturing eternal cardboard necklaces.  

250
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,280
He was inclined to drowse off to sleep in 
the middle of these tasks, a habit which both  

251
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,440
irritated and frightened his young teacher. To his 
relief she complained to his parents, and he was  

252
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,040
removed from the school. The Roger Buttons told 
their friends that they felt he was too young.

253
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,160
By the time he was twelve years old 
his parents had grown used to him.  

254
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,200
Indeed, so strong is the force of custom that 
they no longer felt that he was different  

255
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,040
from any other child - except when some 
curious anomaly reminded them of the fact.  

256
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,680
But one day a few weeks after his twelfth 
birthday, while looking in the mirror,  

257
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:06,000
Benjamin made, or thought he made, an astonishing 
discovery. Did his eyes deceive him, or had his  

258
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,640
hair turned in the dozen years of his life from 
white to iron - gray under its concealing dye?  

259
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,760
Was the network of wrinkles on his face 
becoming less pronounced? Was his skin  

260
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,720
healthier and firmer, with even a touch of ruddy 
winter colour? He could not tell. He knew that he  

261
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,640
no longer stooped, and that his physical condition 
had improved since the early days of his life.

262
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,120
"Can it be - ?" he thought to himself, 
or, rather, scarcely dared to think.

263
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:47,200
He went to his father. "I am grown," he announced 
determinedly. "I want to put on long trousers."

264
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,640
His father hesitated. "Well," he said finally,  

265
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,600
"I don't know. Fourteen is the age for putting 
on long trousers - and you are only twelve."

266
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,520
"But you'll have to admit," protested 
Benjamin, "that I'm big for my age."

267
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,960
His father looked at him 
with illusory speculation.  

268
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,120
"Oh, I'm not so sure of that," he said. 
"I was as big as you when I was twelve."

269
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,400
This was not true - it was all part 
of Roger Button's silent agreement  

270
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,360
with himself to believe in his son's normality.

271
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,400
Finally a compromise was reached. Benjamin was 
to continue to dye his hair. He was to make a  

272
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,880
better attempt to play with boys of his own age. 
He was not to wear his spectacles or carry a cane  

273
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,200
in the street. In return for these concessions he 
was allowed his first suit of long trousers...
 
 

274
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,600
CHAPTER FOUR
 

275
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,200
Of the life of Benjamin Button between his twelfth 
and twenty - first year I intend to say little.  

276
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,000
Suffice to record that they were years 
of normal ungrowth. When Benjamin was  

277
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,160
eighteen he was erect as a man of fifty; 
he had more hair and it was of a dark gray;  

278
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,160
his step was firm, his voice had lost its 
cracked quaver and descended to a healthy  

279
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,560
baritone. So his father sent him up to Connecticut 
to take examinations for entrance to Yale College.  

280
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,240
Benjamin passed his examination and 
became a member of the freshman class.

281
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,360
On the third day following his matriculation 
he received a notification from Mr. Hart,  

282
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,280
the college registrar, to call at 
his office and arrange his schedule.  

283
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,920
Benjamin, glancing in the mirror, decided that his 
hair needed a new application of its brown dye,  

284
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,760
but an anxious inspection of his bureau drawer 
disclosed that the dye bottle was not there.  

285
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,920
Then he remembered - he had emptied 
it the day before and thrown it away.

286
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,360
He was in a dilemma. He was due at 
the registrar's in five minutes.  

287
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,800
There seemed to be no help for it 
- he must go as he was. He did.

288
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,800
"Good - morning," said the registrar politely. 
"You've come to inquire about your son."

289
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,840
"Why, as a matter of fact, my name's Button 
-" began Benjamin, but Mr. Hart cut him off.

290
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,920
"I'm very glad to meet you, Mr. Button. 
I'm expecting your son here any minute."

291
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,320
"That's me!" burst out Benjamin. "I'm a freshman."

292
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,080
"What!"

293
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,400
"I'm a freshman."

294
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,800
"Surely you're joking."

295
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,160
"Not at all."

296
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,160
The registrar frowned and 
glanced at a card before him.  

297
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,880
"Why, I have Mr. Benjamin Button's 
age down here as eighteen."

298
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,520
"That's my age," asserted 
Benjamin, flushing slightly.

299
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,760
The registrar eyed him wearily. "Now surely, Mr. 
Button, you don't expect me to believe that."

300
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,600
Benjamin smiled wearily. "I 
am eighteen," he repeated.

301
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,400
The registrar pointed sternly to the door.  

302
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,600
"Get out," he said. "Get out of college and 
get out of town. You are a dangerous lunatic."

303
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,160
"I am eighteen."

304
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:10,000
Mr. Hart opened the door. "The idea!" he shouted. 
"A man of your age trying to enter here as a  

305
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,160
freshman. Eighteen years old, are you? Well, I'll 
give you eighteen minutes to get out of town."

306
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,160
Benjamin Button walked with dignity from 
the room, and half a dozen undergraduates,  

307
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,640
who were waiting in the hall, followed 
him curiously with their eyes. When he  

308
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,600
had gone a little way he turned around, 
faced the infuriated registrar, who was  

309
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:38,640
still standing in the door - way, and repeated 
in a firm voice: "I am eighteen years old."

310
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,200
To a chorus of titters which went up from the 
group of undergraduates, Benjamin walked away.

311
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,080
But he was not fated to escape so easily. 
On his melancholy walk to the railroad  

312
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,480
station he found that he was being 
followed by a group, then by a swarm,  

313
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:03,200
and finally by a dense mass of undergraduates. 
The word had gone around that a lunatic had  

314
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,400
passed the entrance examinations for Yale 
and attempted to palm himself off as a youth  

315
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,520
of eighteen. A fever of excitement permeated 
the college. Men ran hatless out of classes,  

316
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,800
the football team abandoned its practice and 
joined the mob, professors' wives with bonnets  

317
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,840
awry and bustles out of position, ran shouting 
after the procession, from which proceeded  

318
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,120
a continual succession of remarks aimed at 
the tender sensibilities of Benjamin Button.

319
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,160
"He must be the Wandering Jew!"

320
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,800
"He ought to go to prep school at his age!"

321
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,280
"Look at the infant prodigy!"

322
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,160
"He thought this was the old men's home."

323
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,000
"Go up to Harvard!"

324
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,920
Benjamin increased his gait, and soon 
he was running. He would show them! He  

325
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:55,040
would go to Harvard, and then they would 
regret these ill - considered taunts!

326
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,680
Safely on board the train for Baltimore, 
he put his head from the window.  

327
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,600
"You'll regret this!" he shouted.

328
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,680
"Ha - ha!" the undergraduates 
laughed. "Ha - ha - ha!"  

329
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,440
It was the biggest mistake that 
Yale College had ever made...
 
 

330
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,240
CHAPTER FIVE
 

331
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,680
In 1880 Benjamin Button was twenty years old,  

332
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,960
and he signalised his birthday by going to work 
for his father in Roger Button & Co., Wholesale  

333
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,760
Hardware. It was in that same year that he 
began "going out socially" - that is, his father  

334
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,560
insisted on taking him to several fashionable 
dances. Roger Button was now fifty, and he and  

335
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,560
his son were more and more companionable - in 
fact, since Benjamin had ceased to dye his hair  

336
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:48,640
(which was still grayish) they appeared about 
the same age, and could have passed for brothers.

337
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,080
One night in August they got into the phaeton 
attired in their full - dress suits and drove  

338
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,160
out to a dance at the Shevlins' country house, 
situated just outside of Baltimore. It was a  

339
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,600
gorgeous evening. A full moon drenched the 
road to the lustreless colour of platinum,  

340
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,200
and late - blooming harvest flowers breathed into 
the motionless air aromas that were like low,  

341
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,840
half - heard laughter. The open country, carpeted 
for rods around with bright wheat, was translucent  

342
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:25,840
as in the day. It was almost impossible not to be 
affected by the sheer beauty of the sky - almost.

343
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,320
"There's a great future in the dry - 
goods business," Roger Button was saying.  

344
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,280
He was not a spiritual man - his 
aesthetic sense was rudimentary.

345
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,880
"Old fellows like me can't learn 
new tricks," he observed profoundly.  

346
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,200
"It's you youngsters with energy and vitality 
that have the great future before you."

347
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,240
Far up the road the lights of the 
Shevlins' country house drifted into view,  

348
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,200
and presently there was a sighing sound 
that crept persistently toward them - it  

349
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,080
might have been the fine plaint of violins or 
the rustle of the silver wheat under the moon.

350
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,280
They pulled up behind a handsome brougham whose 
passengers were disembarking at the door. A lady  

351
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:15,920
got out, then an elderly gentleman, then another 
young lady, beautiful as sin. Benjamin started;  

352
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,840
an almost chemical change seemed to dissolve 
and recompose the very elements of his body.  

353
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,640
A rigour passed over him, 
blood rose into his cheeks,  

354
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,320
his forehead, and there was a steady 
thumping in his ears. It was first love.

355
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,360
The girl was slender and frail, 
with hair that was ashen under the  

356
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,360
moon and honey - coloured under the 
sputtering gas - lamps of the porch.  

357
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,480
Over her shoulders was thrown a 
Spanish mantilla of softest yellow,  

358
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,240
butterflied in black; her feet were glittering 
buttons at the hem of her bustled dress.

359
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Roger Button leaned over to his son.  

360
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,920
"That," he said, "is young Hildegarde 
Moncrief, the daughter of General Moncrief."

361
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:10,080
Benjamin nodded coldly. "Pretty little 
thing," he said indifferently. But when  

362
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,720
the negro boy had led the buggy away, he 
added: "Dad, you might introduce me to her."

363
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,960
They approached a group, of which 
Miss Moncrief was the centre.  

364
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,200
Reared in the old tradition, she 
curtsied low before Benjamin.  

365
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,240
Yes, he might have a dance. He thanked 
her and walked away - staggered away.

366
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,240
The interval until the time for his turn should 
arrive dragged itself out interminably. He  

367
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,160
stood close to the wall, silent, inscrutable, 
watching with murderous eyes the young bloods  

368
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,840
of Baltimore as they eddied around Hildegarde 
Moncrief, passionate admiration in their faces.  

369
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,320
How obnoxious they seemed 
to Benjamin; how intolerably  

370
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,840
rosy! Their curling brown whiskers aroused 
in him a feeling equivalent to indigestion.

371
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,560
But when his own time came, and he drifted with 
her out upon the changing floor to the music of  

372
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:12,640
the latest waltz from Paris, his jealousies and 
anxieties melted from him like a mantle of snow.  

373
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,680
Blind with enchantment, he felt 
that life was just beginning.

374
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,320
"You and your brother got here 
just as we did, didn't you?"  

375
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,080
asked Hildegarde, looking up at him with 
eyes that were like bright blue enamel.

376
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,200
Benjamin hesitated. If she took him for his 
father's brother, would it be best to enlighten  

377
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,080
her? He remembered his experience at Yale, so he 
decided against it. It would be rude to contradict  

378
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,760
a lady; it would be criminal to mar this exquisite 
occasion with the grotesque story of his origin.  

379
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,080
Later, perhaps. So he nodded, 
smiled, listened, was happy.

380
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,080
"I like men of your age," Hildegarde told 
him. "Young boys are so idiotic. They tell  

381
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,320
me how much champagne they drink at college, 
and how much money they lose playing cards.  

382
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,840
Men of your age know how to appreciate women."

383
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,320
Benjamin felt himself on the verge of a proposal 
- with an effort he choked back the impulse.

384
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,800
"You're just the romantic age," she continued - 
"fifty. Twenty - five is too wordly - wise; thirty  

385
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:26,800
is apt to be pale from overwork; forty is the age 
of long stories that take a whole cigar to tell;  

386
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:35,200
sixty is - oh, sixty is too near seventy; 
but fifty is the mellow age. I love fifty."

387
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,120
Fifty seemed to Benjamin a glorious 
age. He longed passionately to be fifty.

388
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,920
"I've always said," went on Hildegarde, "that 
I'd rather marry a man of fifty and be taken  

389
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,840
care of than many a man of 
thirty and take care of him."

390
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,600
For Benjamin the rest of the evening 
was bathed in a honey - coloured mist.  

391
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,720
Hildegarde gave him two more dances, and 
they discovered that they were marvellously  

392
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,200
in accord on all the questions of 
the day. She was to go driving with  

393
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,600
him on the following Sunday, and then they 
would discuss all these questions further.

394
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,080
Going home in the phaeton 
just before the crack of dawn,  

395
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,840
when the first bees were humming and the 
fading moon glimmered in the cool dew,  

396
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,720
Benjamin knew vaguely that his father 
was discussing wholesale hardware.

397
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,640
"... And what do you think should merit our 
biggest attention after hammers and nails?"  

398
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,840
the elder Button was saying.

399
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,160
"Love," replied Benjamin absent - mindedly.

400
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,080
"Lugs?" exclaimed Roger Button, "Why, 
I've just covered the question of lugs."

401
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,280
Benjamin regarded him with dazed eyes just as 
the eastern sky was suddenly cracked with light,  

402
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,480
and an oriole yawned piercingly 
in the quickening trees...
 
 

403
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,440
CHAPTER SIX
 

404
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,800
When, six months later, the engagement of Miss 
Hildegarde Moncrief to Mr. Benjamin Button was  

405
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,320
made known (I say "made known," for General 
Moncrief declared he would rather fall upon  

406
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,240
his sword than announce it), the excitement 
in Baltimore society reached a feverish pitch.  

407
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,120
The almost forgotten story of Benjamin's birth 
was remembered and sent out upon the winds of  

408
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:24,560
scandal in picaresque and incredible forms. It was 
said that Benjamin was really the father of Roger  

409
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,640
Button, that he was his brother who had been in 
prison for forty years, that he was John Wilkes  

410
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:37,280
Booth in disguise - and, finally, that he had 
two small conical horns sprouting from his head.

411
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,280
The Sunday supplements of the New York papers 
played up the case with fascinating sketches  

412
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,560
which showed the head of Benjamin Button 
attached to a fish, to a snake, and, finally,  

413
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,920
to a body of solid brass. He became known, 
journalistically, as the Mystery Man of Maryland.  

414
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,280
But the true story, as is usually the 
case, had a very small circulation.

415
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,480
However, every one agreed with General Moncrief 
that it was "criminal" for a lovely girl who  

416
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,960
could have married any beau in Baltimore to throw 
herself into the arms of a man who was assuredly  

417
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,360
fifty. In vain Mr. Roger Button published 
Us son's birth certificate in large type  

418
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:27,600
in the Baltimore Blaze. No one believed it. 
You had only to look at Benjamin and see.

419
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:35,120
On the part of the two people most concerned 
there was no wavering. So many of the stories  

420
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,480
about her fiance were false that Hildegarde 
refused stubbornly to believe even the true one.  

421
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,800
In vain General Moncrief pointed out to her 
the high mortality among men of fifty - or,  

422
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,880
at least, among men who looked fifty; in vain 
he told her of the instability of the wholesale  

423
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,520
hardware business. Hildegarde had chosen to 
marry for mellowness, and marry she did...
 
 

424
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,160
CHAPTER SEVEN
 

425
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,280
In one particular, at least, the friends 
of Hildegarde Moncrief were mistaken.  

426
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,640
The wholesale hardware 
business prospered amazingly.  

427
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,520
In the fifteen years between Benjamin Button's 
marriage in 1880 and his father's retirement  

428
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:22,880
in 1895, the family fortune was doubled - and this 
was due largely to the younger member of the firm.

429
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:30,560
Needless to say, Baltimore eventually received 
the couple to its bosom. Even old General Moncrief  

430
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,280
became reconciled to his son - in - law when 
Benjamin gave him the money to bring out his  

431
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,600
History of the Civil War in twenty volumes, which 
had been refused by nine prominent publishers.

432
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,960
In Benjamin himself fifteen years had wrought 
many changes. It seemed to him that the blood  

433
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,200
flowed with new vigour through his veins. It began 
to be a pleasure to rise in the morning, to walk  

434
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,520
with an active step along the busy, sunny street, 
to work untiringly with his shipments of hammers  

435
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:09,280
and his cargoes of nails. It was in 1890 that he 
executed his famous business coup: he brought up  

436
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,640
the suggestion that all nails used in nailing 
up the boxes in which nails are shipped are the  

437
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,760
property of the shippee, a proposal which became 
a statute, was approved by Chief Justice Fossile,  

438
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,760
and saved Roger Button and Company, Wholesale 
Hardware, more than six hundred nails every year.

439
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,600
In addition, Benjamin discovered that he was 
becoming more and more attracted by the gay  

440
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:39,120
side of life. It was typical of his growing 
enthusiasm for pleasure that he was the first  

441
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:45,040
man in the city of Baltimore to own and run 
an automobile. Meeting him on the street,  

442
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,160
his contemporaries would stare enviously at 
the picture he made of health and vitality.

443
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,280
"He seems to grow younger every year," 
they would remark. And if old Roger Button,  

444
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,800
now sixty - five years old, had failed at 
first to give a proper welcome to his son  

445
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,440
he atoned at last by bestowing on 
him what amounted to adulation.

446
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,920
And here we come to an unpleasant subject which it 
will be well to pass over as quickly as possible.  

447
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,000
There was only one thing that worried Benjamin 
Button; his wife had ceased to attract him.

448
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,560
At that time Hildegarde was a woman of thirty 
- five, with a son, Roscoe, fourteen years old.  

449
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:32,480
In the early days of their marriage Benjamin 
had worshipped her. But, as the years passed,  

450
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,480
her honey - coloured hair became an unexciting 
brown, the blue enamel of her eyes assumed the  

451
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,560
aspect of cheap crockery - moreover, and, most 
of all, she had become too settled in her ways,  

452
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:51,920
too placid, too content, too anaemic in her 
excitements, and too sober in her taste. As  

453
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,480
a bride it been she who had "dragged" Benjamin 
to dances and dinners - now conditions were  

454
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,720
reversed. She went out socially with him, but 
without enthusiasm, devoured already by that  

455
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,400
eternal inertia which comes to live with each 
of us one day and stays with us to the end.

456
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,160
Benjamin's discontent waxed stronger. At the 
outbreak of the Spanish - American War in 1898 his  

457
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:25,120
home had for him so little charm that he decided 
to join the army. With his business influence he  

458
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,960
obtained a commission as captain, and proved so 
adaptable to the work that he was made a major,  

459
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,000
and finally a lieutenant - colonel 
just in time to participate in the  

460
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,240
celebrated charge up San Juan Hill. He was 
slightly wounded, and received a medal.

461
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,960
Benjamin had become so attached to the 
activity and excitement of array life  

462
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,360
that he regretted to give it up, but his business 
required attention, so he resigned his commission  

463
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:01,360
and came home. He was met at the station by 
a brass band and escorted to his house.
 
 

464
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,160
CHAPTER EIGHT
 

465
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,320
Hildegarde, waving a large silk flag, greeted 
him on the porch, and even as he kissed her he  

466
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,840
felt with a sinking of the heart that these 
three years had taken their toll. She was a  

467
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:20,400
woman of forty now, with a faint skirmish line of 
gray hairs in her head. The sight depressed him.

468
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,720
Up in his room he saw his reflection in the  

469
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,160
familiar mirror - he went closer and 
examined his own face with anxiety,  

470
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,520
comparing it after a moment with a photograph 
of himself in uniform taken just before the war.

471
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:42,960
"Good Lord!" he said aloud. The process was 
continuing. There was no doubt of it - he  

472
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:50,800
looked now like a man of thirty. Instead of being 
delighted, he was uneasy - he was growing younger.  

473
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,760
He had hitherto hoped that once he reached 
a bodily age equivalent to his age in years,  

474
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,840
the grotesque phenomenon which had 
marked his birth would cease to function.  

475
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,840
He shuddered. His destiny 
seemed to him awful, incredible.

476
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,200
When he came downstairs Hildegarde was waiting for 
him. She appeared annoyed, and he wondered if she  

477
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,720
had at last discovered that there was something 
amiss. It was with an effort to relieve the  

478
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,520
tension between them that he broached the matter 
at dinner in what he considered a delicate way.

479
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:31,280
"Well," he remarked lightly, "everybody 
says I look younger than ever."

480
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:38,000
Hildegarde regarded him with scorn. She sniffed. 
"Do you think it's anything to boast about?"

481
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,440
"I'm not boasting," he asserted uncomfortably.

482
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:48,080
She sniffed again. "The idea," 
she said, and after a moment:  

483
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,480
"I should think you'd have 
enough pride to stop it."

484
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,320
"How can I?" he demanded.

485
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,720
"I'm not going to argue with you," she 
retorted. "But there's a right way of  

486
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,920
doing things and a wrong way. If you've made up 
your mind to be different from everybody else,  

487
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,880
I don't suppose I can stop you, but I 
really don't think it's very considerate."

488
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,400
"But, Hildegarde, I can't help it."

489
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,720
"You can too. You're simply stubborn. You 
think you don't want to be like any one  

490
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,920
else. You always have been that way, and 
you always will be. But just think how it  

491
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,440
would be if every one else looked at things 
as you do - what would the world be like?"

492
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,920
As this was an inane and unanswerable argument  

493
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,160
Benjamin made no reply, and from that time 
on a chasm began to widen between them.  

494
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,720
He wondered what possible fascination 
she had ever exercised over him.

495
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:52,240
To add to the breach, he found, as the new century 
gathered headway, that his thirst for gaiety grew  

496
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:59,040
stronger. Never a party of any kind in the city 
of Baltimore but he was there, dancing with the  

497
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,240
prettiest of the young married women, chatting 
with the most popular of the debutantes, and  

498
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:11,520
finding their company charming, while his wife, 
a dowager of evil omen, sat among the chaperons,  

499
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,840
now in haughty disapproval, and now following 
him with solemn, puzzled, and reproachful eyes.

500
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:26,720
"Look!" people would remark. "What a pity! A young 
fellow that age tied to a woman of forty - five.  

501
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,520
He must be twenty years younger than his wife." 
They had forgotten - as people inevitably forget -  

502
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:39,840
that back in 1880 their mammas and papas had 
also remarked about this same ill - matched pair.

503
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,480
Benjamin's growing unhappiness at home was 
compensated for by his many new interests.  

504
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,960
He took up golf and made a great success of 
it. He went in for dancing: in 1906 he was  

505
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:59,520
an expert at "The Boston," and in 1908 he 
was considered proficient at the "Maxine,"  

506
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,960
while in 1909 his "Castle Walk" was 
the envy of every young man in town.

507
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,080
His social activities, of course, 
interfered to some extent with his business,  

508
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,560
but then he had worked hard at wholesale 
hardware for twenty - five years  

509
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,320
and felt that he could soon hand it on to his son, 
Roscoe, who had recently graduated from Harvard.

510
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,440
He and his son were, in fact, 
often mistaken for each other.  

511
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,360
This pleased Benjamin - he soon forgot the 
insidious fear which had come over him on  

512
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:37,200
his return from the Spanish - American War, and 
grew to take a naive pleasure in his appearance.  

513
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,720
There was only one fly in the delicious ointment 
- he hated to appear in public with his wife.  

514
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:51,280
Hildegarde was almost fifty, and the 
sight of her made him feel absurd...
 
 

515
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,000
CHAPTER NINE
 

516
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,680
One September day in 1910 - a few years 
after Roger Button & Co., Wholesale Hardware,  

517
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,200
had been handed over to young Roscoe Button 
- a man, apparently about twenty years old,  

518
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,800
entered himself as a freshman at Harvard 
University in Cambridge. He did not make  

519
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,760
the mistake of announcing that he would 
never see fifty again, nor did he mention  

520
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,040
the fact that his son had been graduated 
from the same institution ten years before.

521
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:25,360
He was admitted, and almost immediately attained 
a prominent position in the class, partly  

522
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,320
because he seemed a little older than the other 
freshmen, whose average age was about eighteen.

523
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,680
But his success was largely due to the 
fact that in the football game with Yale  

524
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:42,880
he played so brilliantly, with so much dash and 
with such a cold, remorseless anger that he scored  

525
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,920
seven touchdowns and fourteen field goals for 
Harvard, and caused one entire eleven of Yale men  

526
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,560
to be carried singly from the field, unconscious. 
He was the most celebrated man in college.

527
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,960
Strange to say, in his third or junior year 
he was scarcely able to "make" the team.  

528
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,840
The coaches said that he had lost weight, and 
it seemed to the more observant among them that  

529
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:13,920
he was not quite as tall as before. He made no 
touchdowns - indeed, he was retained on the team  

530
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:20,000
chiefly in hope that his enormous reputation would 
bring terror and disorganisation to the Yale team.

531
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:28,560
In his senior year he did not make the team at 
all. He had grown so slight and frail that one day  

532
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,880
he was taken by some sophomores for a freshman, 
an incident which humiliated him terribly.  

533
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,920
He became known as something of a prodigy 
- a senior who was surely no more than  

534
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,040
sixteen - and he was often shocked at the 
worldliness of some of his classmates.  

535
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,360
His studies seemed harder to him - he felt 
that they were too advanced. He had heard  

536
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:57,120
his classmates speak of St. Midas's, the famous 
preparatory school, at which so many of them had  

537
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:02,800
prepared for college, and he determined after 
his graduation to enter himself at St. Midas's,  

538
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,440
where the sheltered life among boys his 
own size would be more congenial to him.

539
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,960
Upon his graduation in 1914 he went home to 
Baltimore with his Harvard diploma in his pocket.  

540
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:22,800
Hildegarde was now residing in Italy, so Benjamin 
went to live with his son, Roscoe. But though he  

541
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:29,280
was welcomed in a general way there was obviously 
no heartiness in Roscoe's feeling toward him -  

542
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,280
there was even perceptible a tendency on his son's 
part to think that Benjamin, as he moped about the  

543
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:41,920
house in adolescent mooniness, was somewhat in 
the way. Roscoe was married now and prominent  

544
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,840
in Baltimore life, and he wanted no scandal 
to creep out in connection with his family.

545
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,560
Benjamin, no longer persona grata with the 
debutantes and younger college set, found himself  

546
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,920
left much done, except for the companionship 
of three or four fifteen - year - old boys  

547
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,480
in the neighbourhood. His idea of going 
to St. Midas's school recurred to him.

548
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,120
"Say," he said to Roscoe one day, "I've told you 
over and over that I want to go to prep, school."

549
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,120
"Well, go, then," replied Roscoe shortly.  

550
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,880
The matter was distasteful to him, 
and he wished to avoid a discussion.

551
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:25,360
"I can't go alone," said Benjamin helplessly. 
"You'll have to enter me and take me up there."

552
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,480
"I haven't got time," declared Roscoe abruptly. 
His eyes narrowed and he looked uneasily at his  

553
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,000
father. "As a matter of fact," he added, "you'd 
better not go on with this business much longer.  

554
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,640
You better pull up short. You better - you 
better" - he paused and his face crimsoned  

555
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:49,600
as he sought for words - "you better turn 
right around and start back the other way.  

556
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:57,840
This has gone too far to be a joke. It isn't 
funny any longer. You - you behave yourself!"

557
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,480
Benjamin looked at him, on the verge of tears.

558
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,640
"And another thing," continued Roscoe, "when 
visitors are in the house I want you to call me  

559
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,240
'Uncle' - not 'Roscoe,' but 'Uncle,' do you  

560
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,440
understand? It looks absurd for a boy 
of fifteen to call me by my first name.  

561
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,840
Perhaps you'd better call me 'Uncle' 
all the time, so you'll get used to it."

562
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,840
With a harsh look at his 
father, Roscoe turned away...
 
 

563
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,720
CHAPTER TEN
 

564
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,120
At the termination of this interview, 
Benjamin wandered dismally upstairs  

565
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:36,400
and stared at himself in the mirror. He had 
not shaved for three months, but he could find  

566
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,760
nothing on his face but a faint white down 
with which it seemed unnecessary to meddle.  

567
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,960
When he had first come home from Harvard, 
Roscoe had approached him with the proposition  

568
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,760
that he should wear eye - glasses and 
imitation whiskers glued to his cheeks,  

569
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,040
and it had seemed for a moment that the 
farce of his early years was to be repeated.  

570
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:03,200
But whiskers had itched and made him ashamed. 
He wept and Roscoe had reluctantly relented.

571
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:10,880
Benjamin opened a book of boys' stories, The Boy 
Scouts in Bimini Bay, and began to read. But he  

572
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,480
found himself thinking persistently about the war. 
America had joined the Allied cause during the  

573
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:23,760
preceding month, and Benjamin wanted to enlist, 
but, alas, sixteen was the minimum age, and he did  

574
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:30,160
not look that old. His true age, which was fifty 
- seven, would have disqualified him, anyway.

575
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,840
There was a knock at his door, and the butler 
appeared with a letter bearing a large official  

576
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:42,800
legend in the corner and addressed to Mr. Benjamin 
Button. Benjamin tore it open eagerly, and read  

577
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:48,400
the enclosure with delight. It informed him 
that many reserve officers who had served in the  

578
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:55,200
Spanish - American War were being called back into 
service with a higher rank, and it enclosed his  

579
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:02,160
commission as brigadier - general in the United 
States army with orders to report immediately.

580
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:10,480
Benjamin jumped to his feet fairly quivering with 
enthusiasm. This was what he had wanted. He seized  

581
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,320
his cap, and ten minutes later he had entered a 
large tailoring establishment on Charles Street,  

582
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,400
and asked in his uncertain treble 
to be measured for a uniform.

583
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,520
"Want to play soldier, sonny?" 
demanded a clerk casually.

584
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:32,160
Benjamin flushed. "Say! Never mind 
what I want!" he retorted angrily.  

585
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,480
"My name's Button and I live on Mt. Vernon 
Place, so you know I'm good for it."

586
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:43,040
"Well," admitted the clerk hesitantly, "if 
you're not, I guess your daddy is, all right."

587
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,360
Benjamin was measured, and a week later his 
uniform was completed. He had difficulty in  

588
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:55,040
obtaining the proper general's insignia because 
the dealer kept insisting to Benjamin that a nice  

589
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:00,160
Y.M.C.A. badge would look just as well 
and be much more fun to play with.

590
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:06,640
Saying nothing to Roscoe, he left the house 
one night and proceeded by train to Camp Mosby,  

591
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,640
in South Carolina, where he was 
to command an infantry brigade.  

592
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,440
On a sultry April day he approached 
the entrance to the camp,  

593
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,880
paid off the taxicab which had brought him from 
the station, and turned to the sentry on guard.

594
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,480
"Get some one to handle my 
luggage!" he said briskly.

595
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,720
The sentry eyed him reproachfully. "Say,"  

596
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,480
he remarked, "where you goin' 
with the general's duds, sonny?"

597
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,480
Benjamin, veteran of the Spanish - American War,  

598
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,840
whirled upon him with fire in his eye, 
but with, alas, a changing treble voice.

599
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,960
"Come to attention!" he tried to thunder; 
he paused for breath - then suddenly he saw  

600
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,840
the sentry snap his heels together and bring 
his rifle to the present. Benjamin concealed  

601
00:53:53,840 --> 00:54:00,240
a smile of gratification, but when he glanced 
around his smile faded. It was not he who had  

602
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,360
inspired obedience, but an imposing artillery 
colonel who was approaching on horseback.

603
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,320
"Colonel!" called Benjamin shrilly.

604
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,080
The colonel came up, drew rein, and looked 
coolly down at him with a twinkle in his eyes.  

605
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,600
"Whose little boy are you?" he demanded kindly.

606
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,120
"I'll soon darn well show 
you whose little boy I am!"  

607
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,840
retorted Benjamin in a ferocious 
voice. "Get down off that horse!"

608
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,880
The colonel roared with laughter.

609
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,280
"You want him, eh, general?"

610
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:38,320
"Here!" cried Benjamin desperately. "Read this." 
And he thrust his commission toward the colonel.

611
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,080
The colonel read it, his eyes 
popping from their sockets.

612
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,200
"Where'd you get this?" he demanded, 
slipping the document into his own pocket.

613
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,960
"I got it from the Government, 
as you'll soon find out!"

614
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,840
"You come along with me," said 
the colonel with a peculiar look.  

615
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:59,120
"We'll go up to headquarters 
and talk this over. Come along."

616
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,080
The colonel turned and began walking his 
horse in the direction of headquarters.  

617
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,080
There was nothing for Benjamin 
to do but follow with as much  

618
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,560
dignity as possible - meanwhile 
promising himself a stern revenge.

619
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,000
But this revenge did not materialise.  

620
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,120
Two days later, however, his son 
Roscoe materialised from Baltimore,  

621
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:28,800
hot and cross from a hasty trip, and escorted the 
weeping general, sans uniform, back to his home.
 
 

622
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,360
CHAPTER ELEVEN
 

623
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:35,520
In 1920 Roscoe Button's first child was born. 
During the attendant festivities, however,  

624
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,720
no one thought it "the thing" to mention, 
that the little grubby boy, apparently about  

625
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:45,920
ten years of age who played around the house 
with lead soldiers and a miniature circus,  

626
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,400
was the new baby's own grandfather.

627
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,560
No one disliked the little boy whose fresh, 
cheerful face was crossed with just a hint of  

628
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:01,840
sadness, but to Roscoe Button his presence was a 
source of torment. In the idiom of his generation  

629
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:08,640
Roscoe did not consider the matter "efficient." It 
seemed to him that his father, in refusing to look  

630
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:15,760
sixty, had not behaved like a "red-blooded he-man" 
- this was Roscoe's favourite expression - but  

631
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:21,760
in a curious and perverse manner. Indeed, to 
think about the matter for as much as a half an  

632
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:29,120
hour drove him to the edge of insanity. Roscoe 
believed that "live wires" should keep young,  

633
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:36,720
but carrying it out on such a scale was - was 
- was inefficient. And there Roscoe rested.

634
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:44,320
Five years later Roscoe's little boy had grown old 
enough to play childish games with little Benjamin  

635
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:49,840
under the supervision of the same nurse. Roscoe 
took them both to kindergarten on the same day,  

636
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,200
and Benjamin found that playing with little 
strips of coloured paper, making mats and  

637
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:00,080
chains and curious and beautiful designs, 
was the most fascinating game in the world.  

638
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,760
Once he was bad and had to stand in 
the corner - then he cried - but for  

639
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,160
the most part there were gay hours in the 
cheerful room, with the sunlight coming in  

640
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:16,640
the windows and Miss Bailey's kind hand resting 
for a moment now and then in his tousled hair.

641
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,160
Roscoe's son moved up into 
the first grade after a year,  

642
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:28,880
but Benjamin stayed on in the kindergarten. He was 
very happy. Sometimes when other tots talked about  

643
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,240
what they would do when they grew up a shadow 
would cross his little face as if in a dim,  

644
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:39,840
childish way he realised that those were 
things in which he was never to share.

645
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:46,880
The days flowed on in monotonous content. He 
went back a third year to the kindergarten,  

646
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,520
but he was too little now to understand what 
the bright shining strips of paper were for.  

647
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,880
He cried because the other boys were 
bigger than he, and he was afraid of them.  

648
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,960
The teacher talked to him, but though he tried 
to understand he could not understand at all.

649
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:09,280
He was taken from the kindergarten. His 
nurse, Nana, in her starched gingham dress,  

650
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,160
became the centre of his tiny world. 
On bright days they walked in the park;  

651
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:20,480
Nana would point at a great gray monster and say 
"elephant," and Benjamin would say it after her,  

652
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,760
and when he was being undressed for bed that 
night he would say it over and over aloud to her:  

653
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:33,840
"Elyphant, elyphant, elyphant." Sometimes 
Nana let him jump on the bed, which was fun,  

654
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,480
because if you sat down exactly right it would 
bounce you up on your feet again, and if you  

655
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:44,240
said "Ah" for a long time while you jumped 
you got a very pleasing broken vocal effect.

656
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,320
He loved to take a big cane from the hat - 
rack and go around hitting chairs and tables  

657
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:56,480
with it and saying: "Fight, fight, fight." 
When there were people there the old ladies  

658
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,280
would cluck at him, which interested him, 
and the young ladies would try to kiss him,  

659
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:06,800
which he submitted to with mild boredom. And 
when the long day was done at five o'clock  

660
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:13,600
he would go upstairs with Nana and be fed on 
oatmeal and nice soft mushy foods with a spoon.

661
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,640
There were no troublesome memories in his 
childish sleep; no token came to him of his  

662
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,760
brave days at college, of the glittering years 
when he flustered the hearts of many girls.  

663
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:33,760
There were only the white, safe walls of his crib 
and Nana and a man who came to see him sometimes,  

664
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:39,520
and a great big orange ball that Nana pointed 
at just before his twilight bed hour and called  

665
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:47,280
"sun." When the sun went his eyes were sleepy 
- there were no dreams, no dreams to haunt him.

666
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:54,800
The past - the wild charge at the head of his men 
up San Juan Hill; the first years of his marriage  

667
00:59:54,800 --> 01:00:00,720
when he worked late into the summer dusk down in 
the busy city for young Hildegarde whom he loved;  

668
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,680
the days before that when he sat smoking far 
into the night in the gloomy old Button house  

669
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:11,200
on Monroe Street with his grandfather - 
all these had faded like unsubstantial  

670
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,640
dreams from his mind as though they 
had never been. He did not remember.

671
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,480
He did not remember clearly whether the 
milk was warm or cool at his last feeding  

672
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:29,600
or how the days passed - there was only his 
crib and Nana's familiar presence. And then  

673
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:35,360
he remembered nothing. When he was 
hungry he cried - that was all.  

674
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,440
Through the noons and nights he breathed 
and over him there were soft mumblings and  

675
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:48,480
murmurings that he scarcely heard, and faintly 
differentiated smells, and light and darkness.

676
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:56,400
Then it was all dark, and his white crib 
and the dim faces that moved above him,  

677
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:03,280
and the warm sweet aroma of the milk, 
faded out altogether from his mind.
 
 
 
 
 
 

678
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:03,821
- THE END -
