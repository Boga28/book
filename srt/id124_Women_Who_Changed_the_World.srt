CHAPTER ONE
Women and education

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:13,419
"I do not wish for women to have power over
men; but over themselves."

3
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:21,720
Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797)

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,540
Women's rights start with the education of
girls and women.

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:34,480
If we study the history of women's fight for
equality with men, education has always been

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,480
an important topic.

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:45,260
It may be the most important topic, because
women can only be equal to men if they have

8
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,239
an equal education.

9
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:54,640
But the fight for equal education has met
many problems.

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:04,410
In many countries and at different times in
history, girls had very little or no education.

11
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:11,479
In the past, a lot of people believed that
women were not as intelligent as men.

12
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,509
People thought that a woman's only job was
being a wife and mother.

13
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,189
Why educate them for that?

14
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,340
People worried that education was not good
for women.

15
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,090
In some places, people still have these ideas.

16
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,259
The education of girls is still a very important
topic around the world.

17
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:42,859
In the 18th and 19th centuries, people started
to think, write and talk about women's education

18
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,719
more and more.

19
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,810
There was progress in some countries.

20
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:57,359
In 18th-century Russia, for example, Catherine
the Great believed in education for everyone.

21
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:04,740
In 1786, she started free education for all
girls.

22
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:12,120
In England, writers like Catharine Macaulay,
Mary Wollstonecraft, Hester Chapone and Hannah

23
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,210
More all wrote about female education.

24
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:24,319
At that time, girls from richer families only
learned music, drawing, and maybe a little

25
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,470
French and Italian.

26
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:36,030
In her, book Letters on Education (1790),
Catharine Macaulay - the first English female

27
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:42,730
historian - told mothers and fathers to educate
their girls.

28
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:49,950
Women could not do well, she said, because
of their bad education.

29
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,260
One of the most important people of this time
was Mary Wollstonecraft.

30
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,469
She was an English thinker and writer who
wrote about education and social equality

31
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:02,580
for women.

32
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:10,359
Her books have been very important for women's
rights, and they are still important today.

33
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:16,459
Mary was born in London in 1759.

34
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,190
Her family were not rich, but they educated
her.

35
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:27,400
She taught at a school and also worked as
a private teacher - she taught children in

36
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,840
someone's house.

37
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:37,989
She then wrote Thoughts on the Education of
Daughters in 1787.

38
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:46,920
In 1788, she began working for a London book
publisher, who published her novel Mary: A

39
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,319
Fiction (1788) and some of her other books.

40
00:03:52,319 --> 00:04:00,640
Her most famous book is A Vindication of the
Rights of Woman (1792).

41
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,280
In it, she writes that men and women must
have equal education.

42
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,620
Boys and girls, she wrote, must go to school
together.

43
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:19,209
A Vindication of the Rights of Woman is very
important in the history of women's rights.

44
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,340
"Schools do not help girls and women," wrote
Mary.

45
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:32,590
With real education, she said, women could
be good wives and mothers, but also good workers

46
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,290
in many jobs.

47
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,640
Her ideas were very new at the time.

48
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:46,950
Other women wrote about better female education,
but Mary's work was really important.

49
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,630
She believed that education in Britain had
to change.

50
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:57,680
This kind of change could be good for all
society.

51
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,310
Mary was writing about women and the vote
a hundred years before women started fighting

52
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,910
for it.

53
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:12,530
Today, Mary Wollstonecraft is called "the
mother of British feminism".

54
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:23,750
Any woman who has the vote, and can read and
write, can say thank you to Mary Wollstonecraft.

55
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:30,430
In 2011, a group of people wanted to get money
for a statue of Mary in London, so they put

56
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,510
a picture of her on the Houses of Parliament.

57
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,530
"We have a lot of statues of famous men.

58
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,450
Let's have a statue of this famous woman!"

59
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,720
they said.

60
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:51,510
In 2018, more people in politics and theatre
joined the group to ask for a statue of Mary

61
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,430
Wollstonecraft.

62
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:02,880
The fight that Mary Wollstonecraft started
in the late 18th century is still not finished.

63
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:11,220
Since then, many women have fought for female
education - women like Margaret Bancroft and

64
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:21,060
Jane Addams in the United States of America
(USA), and Maria Montessori in Italy.

65
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:29,150
In many places in the world, girls and women
are still fighting for an equal education.

66
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:36,250
One of the most famous fighters for girls'
education today is Malala Yousafzai.

67
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:42,530
Malala was born in 1997, in the Swat Valley
in Pakistan.

68
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:48,060
Her mother and father believed in education
for girls.

69
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:55,290
In 2007, a group of men called the Taliban
came to the Swat Valley.

70
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:02,300
They said, "People cannot have a television
or play music."

71
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:10,470
In January 2008, the Taliban said, "Girls
cannot go to school."

72
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:18,160
Malala used the name "Gul Makai" and began
writing for the BBC (the United Kingdom's

73
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,940
television and radio) about life with the
Taliban.

74
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,870
She wrote about the last days before her school
closed.

75
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:35,610
Malala became famous, both in Pakistan and
around the world, as a fighter for girls'

76
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,740
education.

77
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,490
She was brave, and she spoke about girls'
education a lot.

78
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,140
But the Taliban did not like it.

79
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:56,490
On 9th October 2012, a man from the Taliban
got on to Malala's bus and shot Malala in

80
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,190
the head and neck.

81
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,920
Two of her friends were also hurt.

82
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,450
Malala did not die, but she was very badly
hurt.

83
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,140
She was taken to a hospital in the United
Kingdom.

84
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,840
People in Pakistan and around the world hoped
that she could get better.

85
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:26,210
When Malala got better, she decided to continue
her fight for girls' education.

86
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:34,020
In the next few years, Malala met with girls
around the world, and she met with many politicians,

87
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,810
like the President of the USA, Barack Obama.

88
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:46,130
Everywhere she went, she talked about girls'
education and equality.

89
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:53,870
In December 2014, Malala Yousafzai won the
Nobel Peace Prize.

90
00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:00,830
She was only seventeen years old, and she
was the youngest person ever to win it.

91
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:07,550
Today, Malala and her father, Ziauddin, work
in many countries.

92
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,200
They want to help to give girls an education.

93
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:21,180
Malala has said, "I tell my story, not because
it is unique, but because it is not.

94
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,390
It is the story of many girls."

95
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,340
She is right.

96
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:35,640
130 million girls in the world do not go to
school, and 15 million girls of primary-school

97
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,090
age will never go into a classroom.

98
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:45,820
This is because of things like war, or because
girls have to get married when they are very

99
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,000
young.

100
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,500
In some countries, children have to work to
get money for their family.

101
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:01,900
The education of girls is still an important
problem for countries around the world.

102
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:08,140
Educated women have better health and they
work more, says the World Bank.

103
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:14,870
They also do not have as many children, and
they marry later.

104
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,710
Countries where girls are educated are richer,
too.

105
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:25,120
Spending money on girls' education is very
important if each country wants to become

106
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,630
richer and happier.

107
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:41,740
As Malala has said, "One child, one teacher,
one book, one pen can change the world."

108
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,650
CHAPTER TWO
Women and human rights

109
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,070
What are human rights?

110
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:56,910
Having human rights means that we are all
equal in society.

111
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,300
We are born with our human rights.

112
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,280
They are the same for every person.

113
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:12,410
Examples of human rights are the right to
vote; the right to think and speak freely;

114
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,520
and the right to free education.

115
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,240
Human rights mean that people are not put
into prison because they do not agree with

116
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,020
the government, and that people are not hurt
when they are in prison.

117
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:35,490
It does not matter what gender or race you
are, or how rich you are - you have the same

118
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,450
rights.

119
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:43,290
Human rights are a very important part of
democracy.

120
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:49,450
There have been many women who have fought
for human rights in different countries.

121
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:55,850
In the USA, a lot of black women have fought
for freedom.

122
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:03,940
One of the early fighters was Harriet Tubman
(1820-1913).

123
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:12,600
Harriet was born a slave in Maryland - this
means that she and her family were not free.

124
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,070
When she was twelve years old, she was working
in the fields.

125
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:23,230
She could not read or write, but she was very
intelligent.

126
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:28,220
From a young age, Harriet knew that she wanted
to be free.

127
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:35,240
She also knew that she had to help other slaves
to find freedom.

128
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:43,750
At this time, there were slaves in the south
of the USA, but not in the north.

129
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,470
In 1849, Harriet ran away to find freedom
in the north.

130
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,040
But she did not stay there.

131
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,740
She went back to the south and helped to free
other slaves.

132
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,710
First, she helped her family, and then she
helped others.

133
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,080
She was very brave.

134
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:12,020
She often spoke about the freedom of the slaves
and women's rights.

135
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:18,500
She started schools for free slaves because
she knew that education was important.

136
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:24,779
Later, she also fought for the vote for women.

137
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:33,320
Harriet Tubman led the way for another famous
fighter for human rights, Rosa Parks.

138
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,690
Rosa Parks was born in Alabama in 1913.

139
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:43,700
She is famous because she did not stand up!

140
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:51,400
When Rosa was a young woman, in many places
in the USA, black people - who were called

141
00:13:51,400 --> 00:14:00,010
"coloureds" at that time - and white people
could not sit together.

142
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:08,170
From a young age, Rosa knew that "there was
a black world and a white world," as she said

143
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,460
later.

144
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:16,910
One of the places where black people and white
people did not mix was on buses.

145
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:23,460
Rosa Parks worked at a shop in the city of
Montgomery, Alabama.

146
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:33,300
On 1st December 1955, after a long day's work
at the shop, Rosa Parks got on the bus to

147
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,300
go home.

148
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,470
She sat in a seat for "coloured" people.

149
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,050
In those days, there was a line on the floor
of the bus.

150
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:50,950
White people sat in the front of the line,
and black people had to sit behind it.

151
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:57,640
This meant that, when a black person caught
the bus, they had to get on at the front of

152
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,420
the bus to pay.

153
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,680
Then they had to get off and get on the bus
again at the back door.

154
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:13,580
On this day in December, the bus began to
fill with white people.

155
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,450
After a short time, the bus was full, and
the driver noticed that some white people

156
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,480
were standing up.

157
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,089
The driver stopped the bus and asked four
black people to stand up.

158
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:31,149
This meant that the white people could sit
down.

159
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:39,580
Three of the black people on Rosa's bus stood
up, but Rosa did not.

160
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,390
She continued sitting.

161
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:47,740
The driver asked, "Why don't you stand up?"

162
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,730
Rosa replied, "I don't think I should have
to stand up."

163
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:59,880
The driver called the police, and Rosa was
arrested.

164
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:06,660
What Rosa did on that bus was very important
in the fight for black people's rights in

165
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,920
the USA.

166
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:16,270
Today, there are still many women fighting
for human rights in different parts of the

167
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,590
world.

168
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,440
In Iran, there is Shirin Ebadi.

169
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,910
Shirin was born in the city of Hamadan, Iran,
in 1947.

170
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:35,810
In 1969, she got a degree in law from the
University of Tehran.

171
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:44,320
She later got a PhD - a higher degree - in
law, and she became Iran's first woman judge.

172
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,550
In 1975, she became the first president of
the Tehran city court.

173
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:57,620
Later, Iran's government stopped women from
becoming judges.

174
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:05,239
Shirin lost her job as the president of the
city court, and she had to work as a secretary.

175
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:11,419
For years, Shirin Ebadi fought to work in
law.

176
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:17,449
In 1993, she was able to be a lawyer again.

177
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:23,029
She helped many people in prison, and she
stopped them from getting hurt by the prison

178
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:24,399
workers.

179
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:33,529
In 2003, Shirin was given the Nobel Peace
Prize for her work in democracy and human

180
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:39,639
rights, and for fighting for the rights of
women and children.

181
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:46,649
The Nobel Committee said she was a brave person
who never worried that she was in danger.

182
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:54,139
Now, she travels around the world speaking
about human rights.

183
00:17:54,139 --> 00:18:01,799
Rigoberta Menchu is also an important woman
who fought for the rights of Indigenous people

184
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,809
in her country.

185
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:14,259
Rigoberta was born in 1959 to a poor K'iche'
Maya (Indigenous) family in a small village

186
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,919
in Guatemala.

187
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,470
When she was young, she helped with the family's
farm work.

188
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,559
Sometimes, she worked in the mountains where
her family lived.

189
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:33,619
Sometimes, she went with other children and
adults to pick coffee on big farms near the

190
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:36,429
Pacific sea.

191
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,710
But she went to school, too.

192
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:46,999
After leaving school, Rigoberta worked against
human rights crimes by Guatemalan soldiers

193
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:55,249
from 1960 to 1996, during a war in the country.

194
00:18:55,249 --> 00:19:06,080
In 1979 and 1980, her brother Petrocinio and
her mother, Juana, were killed by Guatemalan

195
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,240
soldiers.

196
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:15,980
Her father, Vicente, died in the 1980 burning
of the Spanish Embassy.

197
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:23,380
In 1984, her brother Victor was also killed
by soldiers.

198
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:32,039
In 1981, Rigoberta ran away from Guatemala
because living there was dangerous for her.

199
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,590
She went to live in Mexico.

200
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:41,570
In 1995, she married Angel Canil, a Guatemalan.

201
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,940
They have a son, Mash Nahual J'a.

202
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:53,539
While in Mexico, Rigoberta continued to fight
for Indigenous people's rights in Guatemala.

203
00:19:53,539 --> 00:20:01,269
In 1992, she got the Nobel Peace Prize for
her work.

204
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:07,859
Rigoberta and these other women have fought
for the rights of women, but also for the

205
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:12,100
rights of all humans.

206
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,669
CHAPTER THREE
Women and the vote

207
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:25,690
"If we win... this hardest of all fights,
then... in the future it is going to be made

208
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:31,970
easier for women all over the world to win
their fight when their time comes."

209
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:42,059
Emmeline Pankhurst (1858-1928)

210
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:48,110
The fight for the vote was one of the greatest
fights that women have had.

211
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:55,330
It started in the 19th century and continued
into the 20th century.

212
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:04,220
In the 1890s, parts of New Zealand and Australia
were the first places to give women the vote.

213
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:10,429
The first country in Europe to allow women
to vote was Finland, which was then part of

214
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:12,490
Russia.

215
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:21,399
Finland also had the world's first women Members
of Parliament (MPs), in 1907.

216
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:27,710
After Finland came Norway, which gave the
vote to women in 1913.

217
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,970
Denmark followed in 1915.

218
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:38,899
In the United Kingdom, the vote did not come
until 1918.

219
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:42,919
The fight for votes there was led by some
very brave women.

220
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:49,679
The most famous is a woman called Emmeline
Pankhurst.

221
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:58,450
She was the leader of the "suffragettes" - the
name of a group of women who fought for the

222
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,470
vote.

223
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:07,580
Emmeline was born in 1858 in Manchester in
the north of England.

224
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:13,120
Her father had a small business, and they
lived in a large house.

225
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,570
Both her mother and her father believed in
women's rights.

226
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:24,799
Emmeline was the oldest of ten children.

227
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:31,039
She was very intelligent and could read when
she was three years old.

228
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,750
In Emmeline's time, girls were not given a
very good education.

229
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:42,159
They learned things they needed for family
life, like how to cook.

230
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,049
But Emmeline's mother and father had money.

231
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:53,090
When she was older, they paid for her to go
to a women's school in Paris.

232
00:22:53,090 --> 00:23:01,269
When she came back five years later, at twenty
years old, she could speak good French and

233
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:08,659
knew how to cook, but she also knew chemistry.

234
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:16,090
In 1879, Emmeline married a lawyer called
Richard Pankhurst.

235
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,309
Richard also believed in the vote for women.

236
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:28,359
He wrote some laws in 1870 and 1882 that allowed
women to keep their money or houses after

237
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,179
they married.

238
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:36,600
Emmeline and Richard had five children between
1880 and 1889.

239
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,070
Emmeline and Richard believed in the same
ideas.

240
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:51,789
When he died in 1898, Emmeline was very sad.

241
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:58,970
In 1889, Emmeline started the Women's Franchise
League, which fought for married women to

242
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,200
vote in elections.

243
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:14,130
In 1903, she helped to start the Women's Social
and Political Union (WSPU), which became famous.

244
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:20,909
They believed in doing things, not only saying
words.

245
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:24,820
The WSPU were the first "suffragettes".

246
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:34,419
Emmeline's daughters, Christabel and Sylvia,
were also suffragettes.

247
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:41,609
In Britain, politicians, the newspapers and
the people were very surprised by what the

248
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:44,440
suffragettes did.

249
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,600
The women walked in the streets and broke
windows.

250
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,470
They burned buildings.

251
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:56,470
When they were put in prison, they did not
eat.

252
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:04,429
In 1913, a suffragette called Emily Davison
was killed when she threw herself under the

253
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:09,100
king's horse at a famous horse race.

254
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:14,940
She did this because the government would
not give women the right to vote.

255
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:21,769
The suffragettes said, "Emily died for women."

256
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:26,669
Emmeline was a very good speaker.

257
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:31,529
She went to the USA and gave many talks there.

258
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:36,759
The most famous one was called "Freedom or
Death".

259
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:40,879
It was about how strong the suffragettes were.

260
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:46,690
Emmeline talked about "we women of England".

261
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:55,570
She said, "The men who are against us have
to choose between giving us freedom, or giving

262
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,779
us death."

263
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:03,390
Some people did not like what the suffragettes
were doing.

264
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:09,119
But Emmeline and the other women knew that
they had to do something.

265
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,989
They couldn't just talk about things.

266
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:22,450
Emmeline, like many of the suffragettes, was
put in prison many times.

267
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:30,179
From 1908 to 1909, she was in prison three
times.

268
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:37,960
From 1912 to 1913, she was in prison twelve
times.

269
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:44,140
She was very brave, and she knew that women
had to win this fight.

270
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,840
She even stopped eating.

271
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:54,139
Sometimes, the police forced her to eat, which
was very painful.

272
00:26:54,139 --> 00:27:02,309
Sometimes, the suffragettes almost died from
not eating, but still they continued to Fight.

273
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:10,919
At times, the suffragettes also chained themselves
outside 10 Downing Street - where the British

274
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:18,539
prime minister lives - shouting "Votes for
women!"

275
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:23,599
There were also some men who fought for a
woman's right to vote.

276
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:31,729
Two examples were Members of Parliament Keir
Hardie and George Lansbury, who both agreed

277
00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:33,149
with the suffragettes.

278
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:42,119
Winston Churchill - who later became prime
minister - started his career against the

279
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:47,960
vote for women, but later he agreed with it.

280
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,129
Maybe this was because his wife, Clementine,
agreed with it.

281
00:27:54,129 --> 00:28:02,450
In 1918, women over thirty got the vote after
many years of fighting.

282
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:12,279
Emmeline died on 14th June 1928, at the age
of sixty-nine.

283
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:21,639
On 2nd July 1928, women were given equal voting
rights with men they could vote at the age

284
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:23,570
of twenty-one.

285
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,470
Emmeline did not live to see it.

286
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:37,899
In 1999, Time magazine called Emmeline Pankhurst
one of the 100 most important people of the

287
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,379
20th century.

288
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:44,159
They wrote that she changed society very much.

289
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,669
What about today?

290
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:54,879
In the 20th century, women in many countries
fought for the vote and got it.

291
00:28:54,879 --> 00:30:16,190
Little by little, women have got the vote
in almost every country 

292
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:29,679
in 

293
00:30:29,679 --> 00:32:26,779
the world.

294
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:44,009
Saudi 

295
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:50,919
Arabia is the newest country to give women
the vote, in 2011.

296
00:32:50,919 --> 00:33:00,719
In 2015, women there voted for the first time
in town and city elections.

297
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:07,559
Hatoon al-Fassi was one of the first Saudi
Arabian women to vote.

298
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:14,960
The Saudi professor and women's rights leader
was driven to the voting station because women

299
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,200
were not allowed to drive in 2015.

300
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,429
She voted in an almost-empty building, which
was for women only.

301
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:33,499
"It feels great," she said as she came out,
with a very big smile.

302
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:37,799
"This is a very important moment.

303
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:42,460
I thank God that I am living it."

304
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:48,450
She fought for that day for more than ten
years.

305
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:56,279
This was progress for Hatoon al-Fassi and
for Saudi Arabian women, but still only 10

306
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:04,220
percent of Saudi's voters in the 2015 elections
were women.

307
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:11,250
In Saudi Arabia and some other countries,
like Pakistan, it is difficult for women to

308
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,980
go out to vote.

309
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:21,179
But, from June 2018, women in Saudi Arabia
were allowed to drive themselves.

310
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:28,929
This may mean that higher numbers of women
will vote in the future.

311
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:34,040
Women have made a lot of progress in the last
100 years.

312
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,589
In most countries, they can now vote.

313
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:44,399
This is thanks to brave women like Emmeline
Pankhurst and Hatoon al-Fassi who fought so

314
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,000
hard and won.

315
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,379
CHAPTER FOUR
Women and feminism

316
00:34:54,379 --> 00:35:01,160
When we use the word "feminism", we are talking
about a number of political and social movements

317
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,741
and ideas that have one goal.

318
00:35:03,741 --> 00:35:11,060
That goal is to achieve equality between all
people.

319
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:18,049
All over the world, feminist movements have
fought, and are still fighting, for women's

320
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,910
right to vote.

321
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:28,680
These movements are also fighting for women's
right to work, to earn equal pay and to own

322
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,230
property.

323
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:37,201
They are fighting for women to get an education
and for women to have equal rights when they

324
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,680
get married.

325
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:47,369
Feminists have also worked hard to stop sexual
assault and other crimes against women at

326
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:52,270
work and at home.

327
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,660
Feminism is not new.

328
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:01,160
It has a long history in the West and in other
parts of the world.

329
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:08,840
The history of modern feminism comes in four
"waves" - or movements.

330
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,520
Each wave looked at different parts of the
same problem.

331
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:22,119
The first wave, in the late 19th and early
20th centuries, was mostly about women's right

332
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:24,100
to vote.

333
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:33,150
The second wave, which began in the 1960s,
was about women's fight for freedom.

334
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:38,530
During this time, women fought for equality
in the law and in society.

335
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:49,859
The third wave, which began in the 1990s,
continues the work of second-wave feminism.

336
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:53,289
In it, women want to be "themselves".

337
00:36:53,289 --> 00:37:02,630
They fight to be different from how some men
want to see them, and from other women.

338
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:10,590
The fourth wave started around 2012, and it
is about sexual harassment and crimes against

339
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,030
women at work.

340
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:21,220
It uses a lot of social media - like Facebook,
YouTube and Twitter - and has been led by

341
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:26,370
the MeToo movement.

342
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:33,940
The first wave of feminism in the West was
mostly about getting the vote.

343
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:41,510
Women in northern Europe and in places like
the United Kingdom, the USA and Australia

344
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:47,580
were all fighting for the vote in the last
years of the 1890s and the early years of

345
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,329
the 20th century.

346
00:37:50,329 --> 00:38:00,080
But, during these times, countries like China,
Egypt and Iran had feminist movements, too.

347
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:08,369
For example, the Iranian Women's Movement
wanted to achieve women's equality in education,

348
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:13,410
marriage, careers and law.

349
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:22,750
In Egypt, in 1923, Huda Shaarawi started the
Egyptian Feminist Union.

350
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:28,750
She was the leader of the Arab women's rights
movement.

351
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:35,819
The second wave of feminism arrived in the
middle of the 20th century.

352
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:46,200
Second-wave feminism was about more than the
vote; it was about sexuality, family and work.

353
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,430
Second-wave feminism also talked about sexual
assault against women.

354
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:58,630
It brought changes in laws about divorce and
children.

355
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:06,250
All over the world, feminists fought to change
family laws that gave husbands control over

356
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,950
their wives.

357
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:14,810
In many European countries, married women
still had very few rights.

358
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:21,859
For example, in France, married women could
not work if their husbands did not agree to

359
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,390
it.

360
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:29,460
That law only changed in 1965.

361
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:35,920
One of the greatest European women at this
time was a French philosopher, thinker and

362
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,990
writer called Simone de Beauvoir.

363
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:46,220
Simone de Beauvoir was born in Paris in 1908.

364
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:52,119
She studied philosophy at the Sorbonne, the
famous university in Paris.

365
00:39:52,119 --> 00:40:00,230
De Beauvoir was only the ninth woman to study
at the Sorbonne at the time.

366
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:09,769
In 1929, when she was twenty-one years old,
she met Jean-Paul Sartre, the philosopher.

367
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:15,339
They were together for fifty-one years, until
he died in 1980.

368
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:21,760
They never lived together, never married and
never had children.

369
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,819
She spent her life writing and thinking.

370
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:39,390
Simone de Beauvoir wrote her most famous work,
Le Deuxieme Sexe (The Second Sex), in 1949.

371
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:46,630
In it, she said, "One is not born, but rather
becomes, a woman."

372
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:56,910
With this famous sentence, Simone was the
first thinker to write about sex and gender.

373
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:02,240
We are born as a sex - either as a boy or
girl, she said.

374
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:12,940
But our gender is made by our society As we
grow, society teaches us how to act like women.

375
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:21,760
Women, said Simone, are always described as
"The Other" - she means that women do not

376
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:31,349
act like men, and, because of this, men believe
that women are not as important as them.

377
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:35,039
Simone wrote a large number of books.

378
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:42,190
Her thoughts about women in society are still
very important today.

379
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:49,980
Later in the 20th century, writers like Betty
Friedan and Gloria Steinem from the USA and

380
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:56,299
Germaine Greer from Australia continued Simone's
work.

381
00:41:56,299 --> 00:42:04,289
In 1963, Betty Friedan's book The Feminine
Mystique was published.

382
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:10,589
It showed that some American women were not
happy if they only worked at home.

383
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:16,750
They were not happy just cooking and looking
after the children.

384
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:24,079
People really liked the book, and Betty talked
about it all over the world.

385
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,710
Ten years after her book was published, more
than half of the workers in the West were

386
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,080
women.

387
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,109
The world was changing fast.

388
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:42,839
Countries in the West are not the only countries
that have important feminist writers and thinkers.

389
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:47,590
In the Arab world, Nawal El Saadawi is very
famous.

390
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:53,010
Nawal is a doctor and writer from Egypt.

391
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:58,150
She has written many books about women in
Islam.

392
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:03,221
In the 1980s, she spent a lot of time in prison
because of her work.

393
00:43:03,221 --> 00:43:14,500
In her book, Memoirs from a Women's Prison
(1983), she wrote, "Danger has been a part

394
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:19,859
of my life ever since I picked up a pen and
wrote.

395
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:27,400
Nothing is more perilous than truth in a world
that lies."

396
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:34,569
People have called her "the Simone de Beauvoir
of the Arab World".

397
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:42,690
The third and fourth waves of feminism, from
the 1990s until today, have often been about

398
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:50,420
women's fight against sexual harassment and
assault, and the fight to be "themselves".

399
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:58,260
Women's sexuality is important in these feminist
waves.

400
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:05,980
These waves are also about the sexism that
happens to women every day.

401
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:12,150
Fourth-wave feminism uses social media to
talk about the problem of harassment in the

402
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,970
street and at work.

403
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:21,300
It also talks about sexual assault in universities
and colleges.

404
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:33,690
Examples of fourth-wave feminism are: the
2017 Women's March; the 2018 Women's March;

405
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,010
and the MeToo movement.

406
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:46,000
The MeToo movement talks about famous men
who have hurt or harassed women.

407
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,769
Many men in the film and TV business have
been accused of harassing women, and of sexual

408
00:44:53,769 --> 00:44:54,950
assault.

409
00:44:54,950 --> 00:45:01,809
Today, English woman Laura Bates is an important
feminist.

410
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:09,720
After studying English Literature at the University
of Cambridge, Laura looked after other people's

411
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,680
children.

412
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,809
She learned that the young girls she looked
after were already worried about how their

413
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:19,030
bodies looked.

414
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:27,010
She set up the Everyday Sexism Project website
in 2012 after finding it difficult to speak

415
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:30,430
out about sexism.

416
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:37,380
The project shows that sexism happens to women
every day in many ways.

417
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:43,450
Women from all over the world can write to
the website about the things that happen to

418
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,630
them.

419
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:49,519
Today some people say that women have won
the fight for equality.

420
00:45:49,519 --> 00:46:00,260
But it's not true; women all over the world
are still fighting for their rights.

421
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:05,670
CHAPTER FIVE
Women and work

422
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:10,289
In the past, almost all women worked at home.

423
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:16,010
They did cooking and cleaning, and they looked
after children.

424
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:21,680
In some places in the world, that still happens.

425
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:29,099
When women started to do paid work in the
19th and early 20th centuries, almost half

426
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:34,710
of it was cleaning and cooking in other people's
homes.

427
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:41,109
It was hard, dirty work, and there was not
much free time.

428
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:44,450
Women often lived in very small rooms.

429
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:51,039
New jobs that appeared in factories, shops
and offices were better.

430
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:57,710
But women earned half the money that was paid
to men for the same jobs.

431
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:08,440
They also worked long hours and got very low
pay - and it was very hard work.

432
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:15,170
During this time, women also became teachers
or nurses.

433
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:20,670
But people thought that this work was not
important, and women had to leave their jobs

434
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:24,180
when they married.

435
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:34,210
War is usually a bad thing, but it has sometimes
been good for women and work.

436
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:44,950
In World War One (1914-1918), men left home
to fight, and women were needed to work both

437
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:50,020
in the army and in their home country.

438
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:59,980
World War Two (1939 - 1945) gave millions
of jobs to women in the USA and in the United

439
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:00,980
Kingdom.

440
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:08,410
Thousands of American and British women joined
the army.

441
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:16,839
Although almost none of them carried a gun,
they did "men's" jobs and got the same pay.

442
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:22,790
At the same time, millions of men left their
jobs to fight the war in Europe and other

443
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,119
places.

444
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:32,390
This meant that women had to go out to work
because they needed to feed their children.

445
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:41,130
After the war ended and the men came home,
more than 2 million women lost their jobs.

446
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:48,359
In the USA and the United Kingdom, women had
to return home.

447
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:53,670
Newspapers and magazines told women to keep
a nice, clean home while their husbands were

448
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,700
at work.

449
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,140
They showed the home as a woman's place.

450
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:06,510
There were still jobs for women, but they
were usually in shops or for secretaries.

451
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:13,890
However, the number of women working outside
the home was still higher than before.

452
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:20,359
This was because a lot of men did not come
home from the war, so women had to work to

453
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:23,980
look after their families.

454
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:30,150
In the 1950s, many countries in the West became
quite rich.

455
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:38,000
Factories were making lots of new things,
and this meant there were new jobs for women.

456
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:46,940
In the 1950s and 1960s, the number of women
who worked outside the home went up again.

457
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:54,060
In the 1970s, women began to go to colleges
and universities to study.

458
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,809
More women were going to college and wanted
to go out to work.

459
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:06,119
This was a change from women in the past,
who only worked a little because they got

460
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:09,359
married and had children.

461
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:15,250
In the West, doctors could help women to choose
how many children they had.

462
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:18,349
Families became smaller.

463
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:23,690
Today, the number of women at work continues
to go up.

464
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:33,440
In 2014 in Canada, for example, over 47 percent
of workers were women.

465
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,259
Today, in many countries, women need to go
out to work to help their families.

466
00:50:39,259 --> 00:50:50,430
They are also going into "men's" jobs - these
days there are women pilots, judges and astronauts!

467
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:55,849
Women are now working in large numbers, and
they are also becoming leaders in business

468
00:50:55,849 --> 00:50:58,700
and politics.

469
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:08,049
One of these leaders is Sheryl Sandberg, who
is the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Facebook.

470
00:51:08,049 --> 00:51:16,470
Sheryl was born in Washington D.C., and she
got an MBA from Harvard Business School.

471
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:21,890
She worked for Google before becoming the
first woman COO at Facebook.

472
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:31,170
In 2012, she was named in the Time 100, a
list of the 100 most important people in the

473
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,170
world.

474
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:43,299
In 2013, Sheryl wrote her first book, Lean
In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.

475
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:49,450
Lean In is a book to help women to achieve
their career goals.

476
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:57,839
It is also for men who want to make a more
equal society.

477
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:05,059
Women are becoming leaders in business, but
equal pay is still a big problem.

478
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:14,290
In the USA in 2016, women earned about 82
cents for every dollar a man made.

479
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:22,019
In the United Kingdom, more than three out
of four businesses pay men more than women.

480
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:29,839
In many jobs, men earn 10 percent more than
women earn.

481
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:36,309
In 2018, it was discovered that the BBC was
paying some men a lot more than women for

482
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:39,010
the same jobs.

483
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:44,400
One of the women who spoke about the problem
was Carrie Gracie.

484
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,589
Carrie Gracie worked in China for the BBC.

485
00:52:48,589 --> 00:52:53,660
She speaks the language and knows a lot about
China.

486
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:58,950
She has worked for the BBC for thirty years.

487
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:06,569
In January 2018, she left her job in China
because the BBC were paying women less than

488
00:53:06,569 --> 00:53:09,059
men.

489
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:17,319
After a long fight, the BBC paid Carrie the
same amount of money as the men were paid.

490
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:22,230
The fight for work and equal pay has not been
won.

491
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:27,509
Women still do most of the work in the home,
which means that many of them are working

492
00:53:27,509 --> 00:53:30,039
a lot more than men.

493
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:36,079
In many parts of the world, women cannot work
outside of the house, or cannot work where

494
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,849
they want to.

495
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:48,060
They are often paid less, and sexism and sexual
harassment at work are a problem every day.

496
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:55,560
Women are 50 percent of the world's people,
and, when they cannot work, it is a big problem

497
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,599
for the world.

498
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,559
CHAPTER SIX
Women and science

499
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:10,720
There have been women in science for many
hundreds of years.

500
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:16,200
Some women were working in medicine, for example,
in early times.

501
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:21,520
Even in Ancient Greece, women were able to
study science.

502
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:29,960
In these early times, the number of women
in science was not high.

503
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:40,059
But, in the 20th century, women started to
study and work in science more and more.

504
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:48,930
One of the big names of the 20th century was
a woman from Poland named Marie Curie.

505
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:55,839
She was one of the most famous scientists
the world has ever known.

506
00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:05,119
In 1903, Marie Curie was given the Nobel Prize
in Physics with her husband, Pierre, for their

507
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,119
work on radioactivity.

508
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:17,160
In 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
without her husband.

509
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:25,220
She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize,
and she is the only woman to win the Nobel

510
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:30,029
Prize for two different topics.

511
00:55:30,029 --> 00:55:32,529
Who was this great woman?

512
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:40,200
Marie Sklodowska was born in 1867 in Warsaw,
Poland.

513
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:46,519
Her parents were teachers who believed in
the education of women.

514
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:50,609
When she was a young woman, she moved to Paris
to study.

515
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:56,730
There she met Pierre Curie, who became her
husband.

516
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:00,619
They were both working with radioactivity.

517
00:56:00,619 --> 00:56:07,660
Pierre died in an accident in 1906, but Marie
continued their work.

518
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:13,839
In Marie Curie's time, science was a man's
world.

519
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:18,759
She was the first woman to achieve big things
in this world.

520
00:56:18,759 --> 00:56:26,430
She was also the first woman to get a PhD
from a French university, and she was the

521
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:31,849
first woman to become a professor at the University
of Paris.

522
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:38,740
Today, we know that Marie Curie was a Nobel
Prize-winning scientist.

523
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:46,059
But we must remember that it almost did not
happen!

524
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:53,670
In 1903, the French Academy of Sciences wrote
a letter to the Nobel Committee.

525
00:56:53,670 --> 00:57:00,210
They wanted Pierre Curie and another man to
win the Nobel Prize in Physics.

526
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:04,310
Marie Curie's name was not there!

527
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:12,910
Then, a Swedish professor of mathematics called
Gosta Mittag-Leffler, who was on the Nobel

528
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:15,810
Committee, wrote a letter to Pierre Curie.

529
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:23,069
"Marie Curie worked on the research too, didn't
she?" he asked.

530
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:28,499
So Pierre wrote back to the Nobel Committee.

531
00:57:28,499 --> 00:57:36,579
He and Marie had to be thought about together
"for our research on radioactive bodies",

532
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:38,450
he wrote.

533
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:44,410
That is why the Nobel Prize was given to both
Pierre and Marie.

534
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:50,049
Marie Curie's work was very important.

535
00:57:50,049 --> 00:58:00,910
She had important ideas about radioactivity
and discovered polonium (Po) and radium (Ra).

536
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:06,910
Polonium was named after her country, Poland.

537
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:12,289
She opened the Curie Institutes in Paris and
in Warsaw.

538
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:18,170
They are still important places to study medicine
today.

539
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:25,720
The Curies' work helped to make X-rays, which
are very important in medicine today.

540
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:32,670
During World War One, Marie helped to put
X-ray machines in ambulances, which Marie

541
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:36,250
herself drove to the places where they were
needed.

542
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:41,579
She worked for the International Red Cross
and taught doctors how to use X-rays.

543
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:50,760
Marie was very good at this important and
dangerous work.

544
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:57,119
But men scientists in France gave Marie a
lot of problems, and she never got enough

545
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,599
money for her work.

546
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:09,890
At the end of the 1920s, Marie became very
ill because of her work, and she died in 1934.

547
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:18,690
Later in the 20th century, there were more
women in science, and some of them did very

548
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,829
important work.

549
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:30,930
However, they did not win any Nobel Prizes.

550
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:36,789
For example, Lise Meitner (1878 - 1968) was
an Austrian - Swedish scientist who worked

551
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:39,859
on radioactivity and physics.

552
00:59:39,859 --> 00:59:47,160
Lise and Otto Hahn led the small group of
scientists who first split the atom.

553
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,329
Their work was published in 1939.

554
00:59:51,329 --> 01:00:01,170
Lise was very famous late in her life, but
she was not given the 1944 Nobel Prize in

555
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:03,559
Chemistry.

556
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:06,029
That was given to Otto Hahn.

557
01:00:06,029 --> 01:00:13,190
Since then, many scientists and journalists
have asked why Lise did not get the Nobel

558
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:14,579
Prize.

559
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:19,640
Was it because she was a woman?

560
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:25,359
Another woman who did not get a Nobel Prize
is Rosalind Franklin.

561
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:30,670
She was a British scientist who was born in
1920.

562
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:37,190
Rosalind Franklin was very intelligent, and
she knew when she was fifteen that she wanted

563
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:40,430
to be a scientist.

564
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:46,710
Her father did not want her to be a scientist
because it was difficult for women, and he

565
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:49,990
told her to study something different.

566
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:58,049
But Rosalind did not listen, and she went
to study science at the University of Cambridge.

567
01:00:58,049 --> 01:01:06,849
Rosalind is most famous for her work on DNA
while at King's College, London.

568
01:01:06,849 --> 01:01:13,079
Her work helped other scientists discover
how DNA is made.

569
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:25,150
James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins
got the Nobel Prize for this work in 1962.

570
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:28,849
Rosalind died in 1958.

571
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:34,700
Because the Nobel Prize can only be shared
between three living scientists, Rosalind's

572
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:42,119
work was not spoken about when the prize was
given to James, Francis and Maurice.

573
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:49,140
Many people believe that Rosalind, like Lise
Meitner, did not get the Nobel Prize because

574
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,009
she was a woman.

575
01:01:51,009 --> 01:01:58,790
Since those days, a lot of female scientists
have won the Nobel Prize - women like Barbara

576
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:05,009
McClintock, Rita Levi-Montalcini and Gertrude
B. Elion.

577
01:02:05,009 --> 01:02:10,170
Now, more and more women are entering science.

578
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:18,420
Tu Youyou is a Chinese chemist who won the
Nobel Prize in 2015.

579
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:25,369
She is most famous for discovering a medicine
for malaria, which has saved millions of lives.

580
01:02:25,369 --> 01:02:32,210
Today, still only 30 percent of the world's
scientists are women.

581
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,470
But the numbers are getting higher.

582
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:41,400
Now, there is a group of young women scientists
who are doing wonderful things.

583
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,289
American Emily Levesque is one of them.

584
01:02:45,289 --> 01:02:51,070
Emily is an astronomer - a scientist who studies
the stars in the sky.

585
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:55,710
Her work helps us to understand our world.

586
01:02:55,710 --> 01:03:03,700
She also teaches at the University of Washington,
and she gives talks about her work.

587
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:09,510
She loves answering questions from people
who are not astronomers.

588
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:17,560
More and more women are now going into science
because of female scientists like Marie Curie,

589
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:22,819
Rosalind Franklin and Emily Levesque.

590
01:03:22,819 --> 01:03:28,339
CHAPTER SEVEN
Women and politics

591
01:03:28,339 --> 01:03:33,769
We know that, in many countries, women started
to get the vote in the first years of the

592
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:36,400
20th century.

593
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,420
Their next step was to enter politics and
become politicians.

594
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:47,550
In the 20th century, women made some progress
in this fight.

595
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:53,779
In the United Kingdom, the first woman to
become a Member of Parliament was Nancy Astor,

596
01:03:53,779 --> 01:03:55,880
in 1919.

597
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:01,180
Astor was born in Virginia, USA, in 1879.

598
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:09,180
There were eight children in her family, and,
when Nancy was young, they were very poor.

599
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:15,680
Later, Nancy's father made a lot of money
in business, and the children were able to

600
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,750
get an education.

601
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:25,690
As a child, Nancy loved reading, and she was
very intelligent.

602
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:30,059
In the 1890s, Nancy met Robert Gould Shaw.

603
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:39,839
They married in New York City in 1897 and
had a son, Robert, a year later.

604
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:45,460
But Nancy and her husband were not happy,
and they divorced in 1903.

605
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:54,290
Two years later, Nancy moved to England with
her son and her sister Phyllis.

606
01:04:54,290 --> 01:05:01,240
In England, she became famous as an intelligent
and beautiful American woman.

607
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:09,980
In 1906, she married Waldorf Astor, who was
also a politician.

608
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:18,749
Nancy became the first woman to sit in the
House of Commons on 1st December 1919.

609
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:22,220
In Parliament, she talked about women's rights.

610
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:28,589
She was also very interested in children's
health and education.

611
01:05:28,589 --> 01:05:35,510
When Nancy became an MP, women could only
vote at the age of thirty.

612
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:39,440
Nancy wanted women of twenty-one years old
to vote.

613
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:46,390
In 1928, women got the vote at twenty-one.

614
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:52,170
Nancy was very strong, and she always said
what she thought.

615
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:58,970
She did many things that women were not able
to do before, like being an MP.

616
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:02,029
She wanted to help other people.

617
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:08,779
She said to the BBC, "I wanted the world to
get better, and I knew it could not get better

618
01:06:08,779 --> 01:06:10,880
if it was going to be ruled by men."

619
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:19,489
Nancy was an MP until 1945.

620
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:25,390
In Europe and North America, changes were
happening fast.

621
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:30,930
But the first woman prime minister didn't
come from Europe or the USA.

622
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:36,869
She came from Ceylon, a country that is now
called Sri Lanka.

623
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:46,880
On 21st July 1960, Sirimavo Bandaranaike became
the first woman prime minister in the world.

624
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:53,430
Sirimavo came from a rich family, but she
always wanted to help the poor people in her

625
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:55,750
country.

626
01:06:55,750 --> 01:07:02,210
She went into politics when her husband, Prime
Minister Solomon Bandaranaike, was killed

627
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:05,130
in 1959.

628
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:13,599
She became the leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom
Party (SLFP).

629
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:20,359
One of Solomon Bandaranaike's cousins asked,
"What does she know about politics?"

630
01:07:20,359 --> 01:07:25,130
"She only knows about the kitchen," said her
friends.

631
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:28,690
They thought it was a big mistake.

632
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:31,210
But they were wrong.

633
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:38,109
Thanks to Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the name
of Bandaranaike became very famous.

634
01:07:38,109 --> 01:07:44,329
She became the world's first woman prime minister,
and she led her country's government three

635
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:46,829
times.

636
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:53,180
She changed Ceylon a lot, and she gave it
the new name of Sri Lanka.

637
01:07:53,180 --> 01:08:02,489
The 20th century and the first part of the
21st century have seen big steps for women

638
01:08:02,489 --> 01:08:03,569
in politics.

639
01:08:03,569 --> 01:08:11,589
There have been many women leaders - women
like Indira Gandhi in India, Golda Meir in

640
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:17,220
Israel, and Margaret Thatcher and Theresa
May in the United Kingdom.

641
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:26,480
There has also been Ellen Johnson Sirleaf
in Liberia, Julia Gillard in Australia, Tarja

642
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,790
Halonen in Finland and Angela Merkel in Germany.

643
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:38,790
These are a few of the women who have led
or are leading their countries as prime ministers

644
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:41,130
or presidents.

645
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:50,300
In 2018, a woman was president or prime minister
in sixteen countries.

646
01:08:50,300 --> 01:09:00,580
In 2016, the USA almost had its first woman
president with Hillary Clinton.

647
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:09,850
Hillary was the First Lady of the United States
from 1993 to 2001 because her husband, Bill

648
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:12,180
Clinton, was president.

649
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:23,340
Then she was US Senator for New York from
2001 to 2009, and US Secretary of State from

650
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:30,560
2009 to 2013, when Barack Obama was president.

651
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:40,480
In 2016, the Democratic Party chose her to
take part in the election of president of

652
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,230
the USA.

653
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:50,140
She won the "popular vote", which means that
more of the Americans who voted, voted for

654
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:56,080
her, but she was not elected.

655
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:03,210
Hillary is a lawyer, and in her career, she
has worked hard for the rights of women and

656
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:05,620
of families.

657
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:15,080
In a talk in 1995, she said, "Human rights
are women's rights, and women's rights are

658
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:18,390
human rights."

659
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:23,520
She said that a country cannot be great if
its women are not free.

660
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,120
She spoke about the rights of women in the
world.

661
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:33,330
In countries where women do well, she said,
everyone does well.

662
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:41,040
Hillary Clinton is an example of a woman who
has achieved a lot in politics, and there

663
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,260
are others.

664
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:47,960
But, in many countries, it is still hard for
women to enter into politics.

665
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:54,140
Often, women have to choose between having
a family and having a career.

666
01:10:54,140 --> 01:11:01,790
Also, politics has always been a career for
men, and when women become politicians, some

667
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:06,420
people say bad things to them.

668
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:09,090
Women still have a lot to do in politics.

669
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:18,800
In 2018, for example, there were 650 MPs in
the United Kingdom Parliament.

670
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:25,670
Only 208 of them were women - that is 32 percent.

671
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:31,680
And that is the highest number of women MPs
in British history.

672
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:40,140
This was 100 years after some women first
got the vote and almost a hundred years after

673
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:43,730
Nancy Astor entered Parliament.

674
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:52,790
Usually, in the world, the number of women
in a country's parliament is 23 percent.

675
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:57,620
But the numbers change a lot in different
countries.

676
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:04,030
For example, there are not many women in the
Parliament of Sri Lanka.

677
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:11,680
In 2017, four of the countries with the highest
number of women in their parliaments were

678
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:15,300
in Central and South America.

679
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:22,730
They were Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Mexico.

680
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:30,860
In 2017, Rwanda had more female MPs than any
other country.

681
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:37,530
There are more and more women prime ministers
and presidents in the world, and they are

682
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:41,230
also becoming younger.

683
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:48,930
In 2017, Jacinda Ardern became the prime minister
of New Zealand when she was thirty-seven years

684
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:50,920
old.

685
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:57,600
She is the world's youngest female prime minister,
and the fourth-youngest woman or man prime

686
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,460
minister.

687
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:07,100
She had a baby in 2018 and was only the second
prime minister to have a baby while she was

688
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,760
in the job.

689
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:16,260
The other woman was Benazir Bhutto, prime
minister of Pakistan, who had her baby in

690
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,870
1990.

691
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:26,200
Jacinda Ardern has said, "I hope that one
day this will not be interesting anymore."

692
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:31,900
She wants it to be normal for women to be
in politics and to be mothers.

693
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:37,910
Half of the people who live in the world are
women.

694
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:47,670
Many people hope that, in the future, 50 percent
of the world's governments will be women.

695
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:53,790
CHAPTER EIGHT
Women and flight

696
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:59,850
In 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright flew the
first aeroplane.

697
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:08,080
Just five years later, in 1908, women pilots
started flying.

698
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:13,850
One of the first women to fly was a young
woman called Amelia Earhart.

699
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:17,230
She flew aeroplanes, and she was a writer.

700
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:26,250
Earhart was the first woman to fly alone across
the Atlantic Ocean.

701
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:30,870
Amelia Earhart was born in Kansas, USA.

702
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:34,930
She saw her first aeroplane at the age of
ten.

703
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:36,840
She did not like it.

704
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:43,630
"It looked not at all interesting," she said.

705
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:49,340
Ten years later, she went with a friend to
watch some pilots flying aeroplanes.

706
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:55,940
A pilot saw them, and he flew his aeroplane
down at them.

707
01:14:55,940 --> 01:15:00,610
Amelia was afraid, but she did not move.

708
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:05,330
As the plane went by, she felt very excited.

709
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:14,480
"I did not understand it at the time," she
said later, "but I believe that little red

710
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:19,050
aeroplane said something to me as it went
by."

711
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:27,880
In 1920, a pilot took her up in an aeroplane,
and that changed her life.

712
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:39,790
She said later, "When I was two or three hundred
feet off the ground, I knew I had to fly."

713
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:44,290
In 1921, Amelia had lots of different jobs.

714
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:48,500
She was a photographer and a lorry driver.

715
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:52,190
She saved 1,000 dollars for flying lessons.

716
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:57,730
Later that year, she bought her first aeroplane.

717
01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:01,290
It was called "The Canary".

718
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:10,270
The next year, she flew to 14,000 feet, higher
than any other woman before.

719
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:14,560
Amelia achieved a lot in the next few years.

720
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:22,760
In 1932, she was the first woman to fly alone
across the Atlantic, which she did in 14 hours

721
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,500
and 56 minutes.

722
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:31,410
She wrote a book, The Fun of It, about her
journey.

723
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:35,010
She loved to fly alone.

724
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:45,230
In 1935, she was the first person to fly alone
the 2,408 miles across the Pacific between

725
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:50,440
Honolulu, Hawaii, and Oakland, California.

726
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:56,650
She was the first person to fly alone from
Los Angeles to Mexico City, which she did

727
01:16:56,650 --> 01:17:01,390
in 13 hours and 23 minutes.

728
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:07,930
And she was the first person to fly alone
without stopping from Mexico City to Newark,

729
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:14,020
USA, which she did in 14 hours and 19 minutes.

730
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:18,440
These were just some of the things Amelia
achieved.

731
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:27,100
In 1937, as Amelia was close to her 40th birthday,
she was ready for a big journey.

732
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:34,370
She wanted to be the first woman to fly around
the world.

733
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:43,180
On 1st June, Amelia and Fred Noonan left Miami
and began their 29,000-mile journey around

734
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:46,000
the world.

735
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:53,310
When they came down in Lae, New Guinea, on
29th June, there were only 7,000 more miles

736
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:54,620
to travel.

737
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:59,850
Their next stop was Howland Island.

738
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:10,390
Howland Island is 2,556 miles from Lae in
the Pacific Ocean, and it is a very small

739
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:11,640
island.

740
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:19,730
On 2nd July, at 10 a.m., Amelia and Fred started
for Howland Island.

741
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:24,030
They flew into grey skies and rain.

742
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:29,960
In the early morning, Amelia called the Itasca,
a US ship.

743
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,360
She said there was cloudy weather.

744
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:39,710
At 7:42 a.m., the Itasca got the message,
"We are flying at 1,000 feet."

745
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:47,060
The ship tried to reply, but Amelia's aeroplane
did not hear it.

746
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:54,440
At 8:45 a.m., Amelia spoke on the radio for
the last time.

747
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:58,080
Nobody heard from Amelia Earhart again.

748
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,310
She and Fred disappeared.

749
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:05,500
Nobody knows what happened to them.

750
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:11,930
People will remember Amelia Earhart because
she was brave and because she achieved so

751
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:16,020
much for women and flight.

752
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:22,900
In a letter to her husband, George Putnam,
during her last flight, she showed how brave

753
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,910
she was.

754
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:30,110
"Please know that I know about the dangers,"
she wrote.

755
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:36,440
"I want to do it because I want to do it.

756
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:43,030
Women must try to do things as men have tried."

757
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:48,910
After Amelia Earhart, there were many women
pilots in the USA.

758
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:52,840
Mary Wallace "Wally" Funk was one of them.

759
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:56,430
She flew aeroplanes for her job at the age
of twenty.

760
01:19:56,430 --> 01:20:04,540
But, in 1960, a space programme was started
by an American man called William Randolph

761
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:08,290
Lovelace, who worked at NASA.

762
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:13,350
He had helped to choose the first seven astronauts.

763
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:18,240
Those astronauts were all white men.

764
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:23,610
William thought that women should also be
able to go into space.

765
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:31,000
He knew that the Soviet Union wanted to have
women astronauts, too.

766
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:38,410
The USA wanted to be the first country to
put women in space, so, in 1960, William began

767
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:43,640
to test women in the USA as astronauts.

768
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:47,880
It was called the "Women in Space" programme.

769
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:54,190
Thirteen women pilots were asked to join it,
and Wally Funk was one of them.

770
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:59,010
Wally Funk always wanted to be an astronaut.

771
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:05,700
She, like the other women, had to do lots
of difficult tests.

772
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:12,440
In one test, the women were placed in special
rooms with water where they could not hear

773
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:16,240
anything or see anything.

774
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:21,520
Funk was in there for 10 hours and 35 minutes.

775
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:26,660
She tested better than John Glenn, the man
who went to the Moon!

776
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:31,690
She passed her tests and was ready to go into
space.

777
01:21:31,690 --> 01:21:37,170
But the programme was stopped before the women
could finish their last test.

778
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:40,590
Was this because of sexism?

779
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:47,630
Maybe the men became afraid that the women
were equal, or sometimes better, than them.

780
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:55,840
Today, Wally Funk has thousands of flight
hours, and she has taught over 3,000 students

781
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,550
how to fly.

782
01:21:57,550 --> 01:22:05,960
After the Women in Space programme, women
started to go into space, but the first woman

783
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:09,850
was Russian, not American.

784
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:16,500
Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman astronaut
to go into space.

785
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:26,420
She was chosen from 400 people to pilot Vostok
6 on 16th June 1963.

786
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:32,390
She is still the only woman who has been on
a journey into space alone.

787
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:35,370
She was twenty-six.

788
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:39,850
Valentina was born in a village about 170
miles from Moscow.

789
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:47,620
Her parents worked on a farm, and her father
was killed during World War Two.

790
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:54,000
Valentina left school when she was sixteen
and worked at a factory, but she continued

791
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,160
her education in the evenings.

792
01:22:56,160 --> 01:23:02,230
She also learned how to jump from an aeroplane
with a parachute.

793
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:05,540
She loved it.

794
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:15,060
After Russian Yuri Gagarin became the first
man in space in 1961, Valentina became excited.

795
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:18,500
She joined the Russian space programme.

796
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:26,980
She was not a pilot, but she joined the programme
because of her 126 parachute jumps.

797
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:33,690
At the time, astronauts had to parachute down
when they came back near to Earth.

798
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:38,750
Valentina and four other women had eighteen
months of lessons.

799
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,460
She did many tests.

800
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:46,430
Of the five women, only Valentina went into
space.

801
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:54,140
The Americans did not send a woman into space
until Sally Ride became the first American

802
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:57,870
woman in space in 1983.

803
01:23:57,870 --> 01:24:05,620
Today, it is much easier for women to become
astronauts.

804
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:08,560
CHAPTER NINE
Women and sport

805
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:17,290
The modern history of women in sport started
in the 19th century.

806
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:24,120
At that time, golf and tennis were two of
the sports that women played.

807
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:30,940
At the first modern Olympic Games in Athens,
Greece, in 1896, there were no women.

808
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:37,280
Women first went to the Olympics in Paris,
France, in 1900.

809
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:46,300
But only twenty-two women played in those
Games, out of the 997 people from nineteen

810
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,340
countries.

811
01:24:48,340 --> 01:25:00,240
Women were in only five sports: sailing, golf,
equestrian, tennis and croquet.

812
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:04,350
Little by little, more women's sports were
in the Olympics.

813
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:09,870
Women's athletics came in 1928.

814
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:16,120
In 1948, the Olympics came to London, United
Kingdom.

815
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:20,890
In these Games, there were more sports that
women could take part in.

816
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:26,060
Men decided who could be in which sports.

817
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:34,250
One famous woman who was at the London Olympics
in 1948 was Fanny Blankers-Koen, an athlete

818
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,350
from the Netherlands.

819
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:40,870
She was thirty years old and had two children.

820
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:47,590
People called her "the flying housewife",
which is a word for a woman who stays at home

821
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:51,780
to look after her husband and children.

822
01:25:51,780 --> 01:26:00,050
Fanny was the top female athlete at the London
Olympic Games because she got the most medals.

823
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:05,000
Fanny was born in 1918 in a small town in
the Netherlands.

824
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,620
Her father worked for the government, but
he was also an athlete.

825
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:13,150
She had five brothers.

826
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:19,080
When she was young, she liked many sports,
and she was very good at them.

827
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,470
She couldn't decide which sport to choose.

828
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:25,470
Her teacher told her to become a runner.

829
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:31,000
As a runner, she could do great things.

830
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,370
Fanny won a lot of races when she was young.

831
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:41,500
But in 1948 she was thirty years old, and
many people thought that she was too old to

832
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:44,370
be the best.

833
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:48,300
Other people said she had to look after her
husband and her children!

834
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:57,490
But Fanny started the 1948 Games by winning
two races - one of them was the 100 metres.

835
01:26:57,490 --> 01:27:05,110
Then she won the 200 metres race and the 4
x 100 metres relay race.

836
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:10,620
When she went home to the Netherlands, the
Dutch were very happy.

837
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:18,070
She showed everyone that a woman could be
a housewife and still win gold medals!

838
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:26,240
In 1999, Fanny Blankers-Koen was voted Female
Athlete of the Century because of her four

839
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:31,760
gold medals at the 1948 Games.

840
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:38,650
Fanny Blankers-Koen was one of the first women
to show that women could also be great athletes.

841
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:48,930
Later, there were other great sportswomen,
like American tennis player Billie Jean King.

842
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:54,500
When Billie Jean King was twelve years old,
she decided that she wanted to fight for equal

843
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,210
rights for girls and women.

844
01:27:57,210 --> 01:28:00,820
And she used tennis to do that.

845
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:07,270
Billie Jean King was born in 1943 in Long
Beach, California, USA.

846
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:13,530
Her family were athletes, and Billie Jean
liked sport, too.

847
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:17,140
She asked her father what sport she could
play.

848
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:19,100
Her father talked about tennis.

849
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:26,390
A few months later, Billie Jean's friend took
her to play tennis for the first time.

850
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:34,300
As soon as she hit the ball, Billie Jean knew
that she wanted to be a tennis player.

851
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:39,320
She began to play at Long Beach, and she used
a racquet she bought with money she got from

852
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,730
little jobs.

853
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:43,190
Her family were not rich.

854
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:49,420
Still, she told her mother that she was going
to be number one in the world.

855
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:56,520
But she soon knew that tennis was different
for women than for men.

856
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:02,400
When she was twelve years old, she played
at a tournament at the Los Angeles Tennis

857
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:07,940
Club, but Billie Jean could not be in the
group picture of young tennis players.

858
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:12,720
That was because she wore the short trousers
her mother made her wear.

859
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,770
She did not wear the usual tennis dress worn
by female athletes.

860
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:24,050
This taught her that being a tennis player
was more difficult for girls.

861
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:32,340
When she got older, Billie Jean began winning
big tennis tournaments, and in 1966, she achieved

862
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:33,790
her dream.

863
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:38,630
She was number one in the world in women's
tennis.

864
01:29:38,630 --> 01:29:54,510
She was number one for five years in total
(1967- 1968, 1971-1972 and 1974).

865
01:29:54,510 --> 01:30:00,420
But Billie Jean saw that women tennis players
did not win as much money as men.

866
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:07,890
When she won the US Open tournament in 1972,
she received 15,000 dollars less than the

867
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:11,340
men's top player, Ilie Nastase.

868
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:18,480
She would not go to the US Open in 1973 because
of that, she said.

869
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:24,360
The US Open became the first big tournament
to give equal money to its men and women top

870
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,840
players.

871
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:32,340
Wimbledon, the oldest tennis tournament in
the sport's history, was the last big tournament

872
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:35,500
to do this, in 2007.

873
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:43,610
Today, tennis is one of the few sports that
pays its men and women the same in big tournaments.

874
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:50,740
This is thanks to Billie Jean and other female
players like Martina Navratilova and Venus

875
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:53,160
Williams.

876
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:57,510
In 1973, Billie had another fight.

877
01:30:57,510 --> 01:31:03,730
This time it was against a man - his name
was Bobby Riggs.

878
01:31:03,730 --> 01:31:11,800
Bobby Riggs was a top men's tennis player
in the 1930s and 1940s.

879
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:19,010
He won the Wimbledon men's tournament in 1939,
and he was the world number one tennis player

880
01:31:19,010 --> 01:31:25,310
in 1941, 1946 and 1947.

881
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:29,640
The women's game was much worse than the men's
game, he said.

882
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:35,920
Even he - a fifty-five-year-old man - could
win against the best female players.

883
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:40,690
He played the Australian player Margaret Court.

884
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:42,960
Bobby Riggs won easily.

885
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:47,920
Then, Billie Jean agreed to play him.

886
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:53,160
The Riggs-King match happened in Texas on
20th September 1973.

887
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:59,920
There were 30,492 people at the match.

888
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:09,320
Also, about 50 million people watched it on
TV in the USA, and about 90 million in thirty-seven

889
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,620
other countries watched it.

890
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:20,180
The twenty-nine-year-old Billie Jean beat
the fifty-five-year-old Bobby 6-4, 6 - 3,

891
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:21,210
6-3.

892
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:25,210
She won 100,000 dollars.

893
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:29,570
Billie Jean knew that the match was very important
for women's rights.

894
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:36,980
In her tennis career, Billie Jean won thirty-nine
big tournament titles.

895
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:40,170
She was one of the greatest tennis players
ever.

896
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:47,250
But she did not just play tennis; she also
made great progress for women's equality and

897
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:50,630
for women's pay in sport.

898
01:32:50,630 --> 01:33:01,170
On 28th August 2006, the United States Tennis
Association (USTA) National Tennis Center

899
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:07,340
was named the USTA Billie Jean King National
Tennis Center.

900
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:13,070
In many countries, women's fight to be in
sports has taken longer.

901
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:21,320
In Saudi Arabia, for example, it was 2012
when two women went to the Olympics for the

902
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,760
first time.

903
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:29,430
Their names were Sarah Attar and Wojdan Shaherkani.

904
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:34,980
Sarah ran the 800 metres, and Wojdan was in
the judo.

905
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:43,560
Since 1980, in Iran, the government has not
allowed women into stadiums to see all-men

906
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:44,560
sports.

907
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:48,340
But now, things are changing.

908
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:56,490
In June 2018, the Azadi Stadium's doors were
opened to women and men during the last two

909
01:33:56,490 --> 01:34:03,290
Iran games at the 2018 World Cup.

910
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:07,050
Things are changing fast in the world.

911
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:16,170
Women have fought for the right to watch sports,
to practise them and to enter tournaments.

912
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:19,430
CHAPTER TEN
Women and empowerment

913
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:31,430
In 2016, the United Nations (UN) introduced
some goals for our future and for the future

914
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:32,440
of the Earth.

915
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:39,930
The goals are there to stop people from being
poor, to look after the Earth and to stop

916
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:41,820
war.

917
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:47,060
They are called the Sustainable Development
Goals.

918
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:50,990
Goal Five is about equality between all genders.

919
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:59,180
This goal talks about empowering women, which
means helping them to become stronger and

920
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:01,490
braver.

921
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:08,680
All the women in this book have felt empowered
to achieve great things, and they have helped

922
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:13,010
to empower other women.

923
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:19,510
The history of women's empowerment is long,
and a lot of progress has been made.

924
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:27,070
But there are still many things that stop
women from enjoying an equal life.

925
01:35:27,070 --> 01:35:32,770
In some parts of the world, for example, very
young girls have to get married.

926
01:35:32,770 --> 01:35:36,860
This is called "child marriage".

927
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:43,390
More than 700 million women in the world today
were married before the age of eighteen.

928
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:49,460
250 million were married before fifteen!

929
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:55,670
This is often because families are poor.

930
01:35:55,670 --> 01:36:00,510
Parents in poor families marry girls when
they are young so they do not have to give

931
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:03,280
them food at home.

932
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:10,690
Sometimes, they also get money from the parents
of their daughter's husband.

933
01:36:10,690 --> 01:36:16,410
In sub-Saharan Africa, 40 percent of women
are married as children.

934
01:36:16,410 --> 01:36:23,860
For example, 32 percent of girls in Zimbabwe
get married before they are eighteen years

935
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:25,980
old.

936
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:32,620
Loveness Mudzuru and Ruvimbo Tsopodzi were
two young women from Zimbabwe who were married

937
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:37,750
to men when they were sixteen years old.

938
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:41,770
Loveness had two children before she was eighteen.

939
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:47,400
Ruvimbo's husband hit her, and sometimes she
had to sleep outside.

940
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:53,530
She said, "I wanted to stay in school but
he refused.

941
01:36:53,530 --> 01:36:59,150
It was very, very terrible."

942
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:05,730
Loveness and Ruvimbo decided that they had
to do something about child marriage.

943
01:37:05,730 --> 01:37:08,930
They took the government of Zimbabwe to court.

944
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:17,770
The law was bad, they said - the lowest age
for boys to marry was eighteen, but the lowest

945
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:20,950
age for girls was sixteen.

946
01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:31,080
On 20th January 2016, after many months of
thinking and talking, the court changed the

947
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,080
law.

948
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:39,900
Now, the lowest age to get married in Zimbabwe
is eighteen, and it's the same for boys and

949
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:40,900
girls.

950
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:47,590
The two young women were very brave, and they
were empowered.

951
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:53,530
They helped to make a big change in their
country.

952
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:57,300
Progress is coming slowly to other countries.

953
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:03,990
In Guatemala and Malawi, for example, the
lowest age for marriage is now higher.

954
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:08,940
Nepal and Zambia are working on laws that
help girls.

955
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:15,850
But the big problem in any country is changing
the way people think about child marriage

956
01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:21,430
- and that takes time.

957
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:28,600
One of the biggest stories of women's empowerment
has come with the MeToo movement, which started

958
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:32,450
in 2017.

959
01:38:32,450 --> 01:38:38,920
MeToo is a movement against sexual harassment
and assault.

960
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:47,150
MeToo was used a lot from October 2017 on
social media to show that there is a lot of

961
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:54,150
sexual assault and harassment of women, everywhere
in the world.

962
01:38:54,150 --> 01:39:00,990
At the same time, famous men in the film business,
like Harvey Weinstein, were accused of harassing

963
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:11,030
and assaulting women - and men in TV and politics
have also been accused of these crimes.

964
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:20,230
In 2018, a very famous man in American TV,
Bill Cosby, was convicted of sexual assault

965
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:25,940
and was sent to prison for three to ten years.

966
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:35,500
The words "Me Too" were first used by an American
woman called Tarana Burke in 2006.

967
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:41,730
They were used again by actor Alyssa Milano
in 2017.

968
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:49,980
Alyssa told women to write about sexism and
harassment on social media to show how big

969
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,340
the problem was.

970
01:39:51,340 --> 01:40:01,870
That night, social media became very busy,
as MeToo started everywhere in the world.

971
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:11,260
At the end of that day, there were movements
in many languages, like Arabic, Farsi, French,

972
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:14,190
Hindi and Spanish.

973
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:22,220
Today, women in many different countries are
using MeToo every day to tell people about

974
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:25,390
the assault and harassment they get.

975
01:40:25,390 --> 01:40:29,640
They are asking for change.

976
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:36,840
Many famous women said "Me Too" - Hollywood
actors like Gwyneth Paltrow, Ashley Judd,

977
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:42,680
Jennifer Lawrence and Uma Thurman have all
said it.

978
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:49,870
Because of this, everyone learned that there
is a lot of sexual assault in the film business.

979
01:40:49,870 --> 01:40:58,150
More than 300 women from Hollywood got together
and started a group called "Time's Up".

980
01:40:58,150 --> 01:41:03,300
They asked for money for women who have been
sexually assaulted.

981
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:13,640
17,700,000 women say that they have been sexually
harassed or assaulted since 1998.

982
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:20,670
Time magazine gave the "Person of the Year"
for 2017 to the brave women who spoke about

983
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:25,480
the problem of sexual harassment and assault.

984
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:31,610
In many countries, it is very difficult for
women to talk about sexual assault.

985
01:41:31,610 --> 01:41:39,380
Many women became brave because they saw other
brave women in the MeToo movement.

986
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:43,320
They chose to speak after other women spoke
out.

987
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:52,680
In Japan, for example, the MeToo movement
started small, but it is getting bigger.

988
01:41:52,680 --> 01:42:00,860
Buzzfeed Japan, which is a news website, has
started a MeToo page with stories about the

989
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:03,220
movement in Japan.

990
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:09,670
Today, the MeToo movement is very big everywhere.

991
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:16,220
Women have started really talking about sexual
harassment, which is a big problem in their

992
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:17,690
lives.

993
01:42:17,690 --> 01:42:22,340
In the 21st century, women are stronger and
braver than ever.

994
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:25,450
They still need to make progress.

995
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:32,670
But thanks to the women in this book - and
others - women are now much more equal in

996
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:35,580
society than they have ever been before.

997
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:36,150
- THE END -
