00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:01,800
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,730
The Greek World

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,650
On his black warhorse Bucephalas, Alexander,
king of Macedonia, rode at the head of his

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,540
army.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,240
Unlike most of his soldiers, he had no beard.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,580
His skin was fair and his light-coloured,
wavy hair grew long and low on his neck.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,490
He was in India, and proud of the past few
years.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,290
Finally, he had proved that he was the greatest
general in history.

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:38,270
And he now ruled the greatest empire that
the world had ever seen.

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,370
His soldiers had joined him from many parts
of the world.

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:48,570
There were Thracians, Macedonians and Greeks
from southeastern Europe; Scythians, Bactrians

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:57,079
and Sogdians from central Asia; and Indians,
riding their enormous, armoured war elephants.

13
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,489
It seemed that no one could stop the march
of this extraordinary army.

14
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,130
Certainly not the Persians, who had once ruled
much of Asia but were now completely defeated

15
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,620
by Alexander the Great.

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:17,860
Two centuries earlier, the Persians' enemy
in Europe was Greece, not Macedonia.

17
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:23,689
In those days, and during Alexander's lifetime,
Greece was not a country.

18
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:29,420
It was a collection of independent city-states
which shared a language, a religion and a

19
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,030
way of life.

20
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:39,170
Athens and Sparta were two of the most famous
city- states, but there were almost 1,500

21
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,850
others.

22
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,579
They were not only found in the area that
we call Greece today.

23
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:50,490
Greek people lived in coastal areas all around
the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.

24
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:59,200
Naples in Italy, Marseille in France and Izmir
in Turkey all started life as Greek city-states.

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:07,510
By 500 BC, the Greek city-states in Asia had
lost their independence.

26
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:12,750
They were under the control of the Persian
Empire and had to pay high taxes to the Persian

27
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:22,390
king, Darius I. In 499 BC, they fought for
their independence, with the help of the Athenians.

28
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,540
Unfortunately, they suffered a serious defeat.

29
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,069
As punishment for this trouble-making, Darius
decided to conquer the whole of present-day

30
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,840
Greece.

31
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,920
In 490 BC, he sent an enormous army to Athens,
but the Athenians defeated it at the Battle

32
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,900
of Marathon.

33
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,950
After the battle, a messenger called Pheidippides
ran straight home to Athens to tell everyone

34
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,010
the good news.

35
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:58,560
From Marathon to Athens was a distance of
42.195 kilometres - the same distance is called

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,959
a 'marathon' today in memory of that great
run.

37
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,760
When King Darius died, his son Xerxes continued
the war against Greece.

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,269
In 480 BC he sent another army, even larger
than his father's one.

39
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:21,310
It defeated the Spartans at Thermopylae (which
means 'Gates of Fire') and marched towards

40
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,060
Athens.

41
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,950
The Athenians had to leave their city to escape
the Persian army.

42
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,590
While the Athenians were away, the Persians
destroyed the buildings on the Acropolis,

43
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,870
the religious part of the city.

44
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,830
To the Greeks, this was unforgivable.

45
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,930
But the Greeks soon made the Persians pay
for their crimes.

46
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,940
Athenian ships beat the Persians at sea in
the Battle of Salamis, and then the armies

47
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,150
of all Greece fought side by side to defeat
the Persians at Plataea.

48
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,810
Soon the Persian army returned to Asia.

49
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,980
The danger had passed.

50
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:06,910
But the Greeks never forgot that they had
nearly become part of the Persian Empire.

51
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,890
Although they had fought together in the Persian
Wars, the city-states continued to be independent

52
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,890
from each other.

53
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,590
Some were ruled by a king, or a small group
of noblemen.

54
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:24,060
Others, like Athens, were democracies and
were ruled by the people.

55
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,790
Unlike our democracies today, the ordinary
people made all the political decisions.

56
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:35,090
At least forty times a year, they came together
in enormous numbers to discuss and vote on

57
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:41,220
matters of government - whether to go to war,
when to have public holidays, or how to reduce

58
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,370
the number of accidents at sea.

59
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:52,139
Women could not vote, but the ordinary men
of these Greek democracies had real power.

60
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,880
Religion was an important part of Greek life.

61
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,850
There were many Greek gods.

62
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,460
Zeus was the king of the gods, and he used
thunder and lightning to punish the people

63
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,009
on earth and send messages to them.

64
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,680
He had many children, and they too were gods.

65
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,950
His son Dionysus was god of the forces of
nature; his daughter Athene was connected

66
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,389
with learning; and there were many more.

67
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:25,580
All over the Greek world, people used to visit
special places to ask the gods for advice.

68
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,370
They asked whether they should start a new
business or choose a wife; as city officials,

69
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,530
they asked whether they should build a new
temple or go to war.

70
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:41,120
Communicating through religious officials,
the gods gave them complicated answers that

71
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,340
could often be understood in different ways.

72
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,250
In the sixth century BC, for example, the
Athenians sent officials to the Greeks' most

73
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,389
important religious centre, Delphi.

74
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:59,009
They asked the god Apollo how they should
protect themselves from attack by the Persians,

75
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:04,509
and were told that they would be safe from
the Persians behind a wall of wood.

76
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:11,060
After much discussion, the Athenians decided
that the 'wall of wood' meant ships.

77
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,940
They built warships and learnt to sail them.

78
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,650
A few years later, they defeated the Persians
at sea.

79
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,260
The Greeks believed that the greatest heroes,
like Hercules, went to live with the gods

80
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,440
when they died.

81
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,810
Ordinary people went to a dark place below
the earth called the Underworld.

82
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,849
Each Greek city-state was under the protection
of one or more of the gods.

83
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:41,550
Each of these gods usually had a temple, built
in a style that has been copied in the Western

84
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,750
world for almost 2,500 years.

85
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,560
To keep their gods happy, the people of the
city held regular religious celebrations.

86
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,710
They brought gifts, and performed special
songs and dances.

87
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:01,169
The Greeks are remembered for their love of
the theatre, which they performed in celebration

88
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:03,620
of the god Dionysus.

89
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:09,009
The plays of great writers like Euripides
are still performed today.

90
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:12,170
Other forms of literature were popular too.

91
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:17,860
The Iliad and The Odyssey by Homer were long
poems which told stories about the heroes

92
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,550
of the Trojan War.

93
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:28,110
Other Greeks wrote beautiful love poems and
the Western worlds earliest works of history.

94
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,780
Philosophy was invented in Greece, and the
work of Plato and Aristotle is still important

95
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,720
today.

96
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,250
The Greeks also made many discoveries in mathematics
and science.

97
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:48,250
Hippocrates, a doctor of the fifth century
BC, is now called 'the father of medicine'.

98
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,039
Medical students all over the world have to
promise to follow his rules for looking after

99
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,750
patients.

100
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,520
The Greeks thought it was important to exercise
both their minds and their bodies.

101
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,639
They were great admirers of physical beauty
in men as well as women.

102
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,060
The social centre of a typical Greek city
was its gymnasium, where rich citizens took

103
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,009
physical exercise.

104
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:20,259
Every four years, the city-states sent their
best sportsmen to the city of Olympia for

105
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:22,320
the Olympic Games.

106
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:29,479
There, competitions were held in running,
jumping, fighting, horseriding, chariot racing

107
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:32,050
and spear throwing.

108
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:37,130
The greatest sportsmen at the Olympic Games
became heroes of the Greek world, and were

109
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,580
celebrated in poems by writers like Pindar.

110
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,810
But the competition between Greek city-states
was not always peaceful.

111
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,269
There were often wars too.

112
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:54,950
Except in Sparta, Greek armies did not have
professional soldiers; the soldiers were usually

113
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,700
farmers.

114
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,870
Fighting took place in the summer months,
and the soldiers went home in the autumn to

115
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,450
look after their fields.

116
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,320
The wars were usually about land.

117
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,140
No city wanted other cities to control too
much land or become too powerful.

118
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:19,899
At the end of the fifth century BC, Athens
and Sparta were at war for twenty-seven years.

119
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:25,130
It was a time of great suffering all over
the Greek world.

120
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:30,190
At that time, Macedonia in the north was not
an important part of Greece.

121
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,930
In fact, most Greeks did not think that Macedonia
was part of Greece at all.

122
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:43,750
The Macedonians spoke a strange form of Greek
that other Greek speakers had difficulty understanding.

123
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:49,829
Macedonian noblemen liked horse-riding, hunting,
eating meat and drinking wine.

124
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:56,300
They did not share other Greeks' interest
in literature, science and philosophy.

125
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,170
Macedonia was ruled by a royal family that
believed they were relatives of the great

126
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,330
god Zeus.

127
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:07,079
The king lived in Pella, Macedonia's capital
city.

128
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:12,530
The palace was as beautiful as the finest
buildings in Greece, and the Macedonian kings

129
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,270
wanted their country to be more Greek.

130
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:23,180
They welcomed several important Greeks there,
including many who were escaping the wars.

131
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:30,300
The writer Pindar and the doctor Hippocrates
were guests of the Macedonian kings, and Euripides

132
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,500
wrote one of his greatest plays in Pella.

133
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:42,620
And then, in 359 BC, Alexander's father Philip
became king, and Macedonia's relationship

134
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:48,610
with the rest of Greece changed forever.

135
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,839
CHAPTER TWO

136
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,589
A Macedonian Prince

137
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:59,250
Although Alexander's achievements were extraordinary,
in many ways his father, King Philip, was

138
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,500
responsible for his success.

139
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:09,050
When Philip became king of Macedonia, he threw
all his energy into increasing his power.

140
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,110
He conquered the lands east of Macedonia,
which were rich in gold.

141
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,110
With this gold, he was able to pay for a full-time,
professional army, which gave him a great

142
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:25,079
advantage over the part-time armies of the
Greek city-states to his south.

143
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:33,519
It was a well-trained, well-organized army,
and soon it had defeated all Macedonia's neighbours.

144
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:40,120
When he died, Philip's empire covered most
of modern-day Macedonia, Greece, Albania,

145
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,260
Bulgaria and European Turkey.

146
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,180
In Macedonia, men were allowed to have more
than one wife at the same time.

147
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,950
Philip had six wives.

148
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:58,709
His first wife, his queen and the mother of
Alexander, was called Olympias.

149
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:01,790
Olympias was a princess from the neighbouring
state of Epirus.

150
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,010
She had a strong character and a quick temper.

151
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,500
If she had a serious argument with someone,
that person was unlikely to stay alive for

152
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,190
long.

153
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:19,170
There were many stories about her wild behaviour
and her love of the god Dionysus.

154
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,480
In the Greek world it was normal to kill a
few animals as gifts to the gods.

155
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,120
But when Olympias organized religious celebrations,
thousands of animals were killed as gifts

156
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,150
to Dionysus; then Olympias and her friends
drank the animals' blood.

157
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:41,940
They played with poisonous snakes too; it
was said that Olympias liked to sleep with

158
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,240
a snake in her bed.

159
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,570
It is not surprising, with parents like this,
that Alexander was brave and adventurous.

160
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,340
His teachers too helped to make him a strong
and successful leader.

161
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:02,269
His first teacher was a relative of Olympias
- a man called Leonidas.

162
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:03,950
Alexander hated him.

163
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:09,520
Leonidas made Alexander exercise without having
breakfast, and gave him only a small snack

164
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,630
for his evening meal.

165
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:19,130
He even checked Alexander's school bags, so
Olympias could not hide food in them.

166
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:24,270
Alexander loved music and literature, but
his favourite hobby was hunting.

167
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,610
He hunted with dogs, and he was always fond
of them.

168
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:34,779
Many years later he even named a city in India
after his pet dog Peritas.

169
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:41,830
A hunter also needed a horse, and Alexander's
horse was one of the most famous in history.

170
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:47,050
A Greek friend of Philip bought it for an
enormous sum of money and gave it to Philip

171
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,370
as a present.

172
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,930
Alexander, aged twelve, went with his father
to see this gift.

173
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:58,640
It was a powerful black warhorse, but it was
wild.

174
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,760
It jumped and kicked and turned.

175
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,360
Nobody was able to ride it.

176
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,300
When Philip ordered his men to take the horse
away, Alexander asked his father to wait.

177
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,139
He turned the horse towards the sun, so it
could not see its own shadow.

178
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:18,750
It immediately became less frightened.

179
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:24,139
Whispering in its ear, Alexander gently climbed
on the horse's back and rode it proudly round

180
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:25,300
the field.

181
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,070
Everyone was full of admiration.

182
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:35,000
Philip, it was said, had tears in his eyes
as he watched his smiling son.

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,380
Alexander kept the horse, which he called
Bucephalas, and for the next twenty years

184
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,300
man and horse were rarely separated.

185
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,800
As Philip became richer and more powerful,
he hired philosophers, artists, musicians

186
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,820
and engineers from all over the Greek world.

187
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,320
His court at Pella was an exciting place for
a young prince to grow up.

188
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,230
Alexander could talk to people who had lived
in Egypt, and made friends with a man who

189
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,070
had been a governor in the Persian Empire.

190
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,930
Macedonia was now well-connected in the wider
world.

191
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,610
Philip was too busy leading his army to spend
much time with his son.

192
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,790
But he made sure that Alexander's teacher
during his teenage years would be the best

193
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,620
that money could buy.

194
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,279
When Alexander was thirteen, his father hired
Aristotle, a student of the great philosopher

195
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:32,380
Plato.

196
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:38,360
At that time, Aristotle was an unknown teacher
with thin legs and small eyes.

197
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,440
He also had one of the sharpest and most questioning
minds in history.

198
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,080
Aristotle later wrote many important works
of philosophy.

199
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,920
He was one of the first people to use scientific
methods to learn more about plants and animals.

200
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,740
He studied the stars and the way that the
sea shapes the land.

201
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,940
He wrote about politics and literature.

202
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,820
The list of his interests and achievements
is extraordinary.

203
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,360
Nobody knows how much he taught Alexander.

204
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,240
Aristotle later wrote that it was a waste
of time teaching political science to a young

205
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:23,460
man, because 'he has no experience of life,
and still follows his emotions'.

206
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,699
Was he describing his pupil Alexander here?

207
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:27,899
Perhaps.

208
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:34,519
But as Alexander grew up, like his teacher
he never stopped asking questions.

209
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,270
Whenever Pella had visitors from other parts
of the world, Alexander learnt as much as

210
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,460
he could from them.

211
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:48,380
Alexander, like Aristotle, had a hunger for
knowledge.

212
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,319
Alexander was not Aristotle's only pupil in
Macedonia.

213
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:58,070
Aristotle also taught the sons of leading
noblemen, and among them were many of Alexanders

214
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:08,390
future commanders: Ptolemy, Perdiccas, Seleucus,
Nearchus, and Alexanders best friend Hephaistion.

215
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,390
These friends, like the horse Bucephalas,
followed Alexander loyally to the ends of

216
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,630
the earth.

217
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,809
Alexander grew up quickly into a responsible
and intelligent young man.

218
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:25,040
When he was sixteen, he was allowed to take
charge of the government while Philip was

219
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,620
away with the army.

220
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:34,440
Soon after this, a tribe to the east of Macedonia
started to cause trouble, and Alexander himself

221
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,050
led a small army to defeat it.

222
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:42,710
Then, when he was eighteen, he commanded part
of his father's great army at the Battle of

223
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,570
Chaeronea.

224
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:50,310
In this battle the Macedonians finally defeated
the Greek city-states and forced them to accept

225
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,430
Philip as their leader.

226
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:59,620
Philip started to make plans to free the Greek
cities in Asia from Persian rule.

227
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,020
Alexander felt that he would have an important
part to play in his father's war against Persia.

228
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,030
The future looked good.

229
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,440
But then his father fell in love.

230
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,730
Eurydice was the daughter of a Macedonian
nobleman.

231
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,799
She was young and very beautiful.

232
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:20,990
Soon Philip was planning their wedding.

233
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:27,390
Olympias was very angry because, as Philip's
new wife, Eurydice would be more powerful

234
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,380
than she was.

235
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,950
And if Eurydice had a son, he could be chosen
as king instead of Alexander.

236
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,789
At the wedding, there was a big argument.

237
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:44,299
Alexander attacked his father, although no
one was hurt.

238
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:50,700
Alexander and his mother left the court immediately;
Alexander soon returned, but his mother went

239
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,140
to live in her home country, Epirus.

240
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,429
Without his mother, Alexander was very nervous
about his position at court.

241
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:04,500
Then he heard news that made him even more
worried.

242
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,799
In preparation for his war on Persia, Philip
was in contact with the king of Caria, on

243
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:15,210
the western edge of the Persian Empire, and
the two rulers wanted to arrange a family

244
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,289
marriage.

245
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:24,120
As well as Alexander, Philip had another son,
Alexander's half-brother Arrhidaeus.

246
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,760
He had learning difficulties and could never
be given adult responsibilities.

247
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,210
Philip suggested that Arrhidaeus should marry
a Carian princess.

248
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,510
Alexander could not understand why his father
wanted this royal marriage for Arrhidaeus

249
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,760
and not for him.

250
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,320
He sent friends to the Carian court to say
that he would make a much better husband than

251
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,450
his half-brother.

252
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,380
The Carian king was pleased at first.

253
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,440
But Philip was very angry when he heard what
Alexander had done.

254
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,300
He did not want to waste Alexander on a small
country like Caria.

255
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:07,770
Alexander's friends were sent away from Macedonia,
and soon the Carian king got worried and lost

256
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:12,690
interest in a marriage with anyone in Philip's
family.

257
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,320
Alexander had ruined everything.

258
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,520
His position at court became even weaker than
before.

259
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,429
As Philip sent part of his army into Asia
to start the war against Persia, he planned

260
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:27,670
another wedding.

261
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:33,590
Cleopatra, Alexander's sister, was marrying
her uncle, the king of Epirus.

262
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,169
All the local rulers in Philip's empire were
there.

263
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:43,210
But Olympias, who was Cleopatra's mother as
well as the king of Epirus's sister, was not

264
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,140
at the wedding.

265
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,419
Since he was joining the royal families of
Epirus and Macedonia with this new marriage,

266
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:56,330
Philip did not need Olympias and her Epirote
connections.

267
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,809
After the wedding, Philip was walking to the
celebrations with Alexander and his daughter's

268
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:02,700
new husband.

269
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,300
His endless battles had left him with one
eye and a bad leg, but he was still full of

270
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,159
energy, dreaming of a successful war in Persia.

271
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,779
Suddenly, a man moved towards them.

272
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:18,650
It was one of Philip's bodyguards.

273
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,650
Without a word, he pushed a knife into Philip's
chest.

274
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,919
Then he ran.

275
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,560
But he fell as he tried to get on his horse,
and Philip's other bodyguards soon killed

276
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,870
him.

277
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,950
There was no hope for King Philip.

278
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,610
He was dead.

279
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,960
CHAPTER THREE

280
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,240
The Young King

281
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,590
We will never know why Philip was killed.

282
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,809
He certainly had many political enemies inside
and outside his empire who had the money to

283
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,520
pay for his murder.

284
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,910
Some people at the time said that Philip and
his murderer had argued about a lover.

285
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,020
But it is more likely that Olympias was responsible.

286
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:08,341
Philip had not included his first wife in
his plans for Macedonia's great future, so

287
00:22:08,341 --> 00:22:14,270
Olympias, quick-tempered and dangerous, had
arranged his murder.

288
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:21,180
She would have more power as King Alexander's
mother than as King Philip's unwanted wife.

289
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,140
But in Macedonia, rule did not always pass
to the dead king's oldest son.

290
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:32,669
At the time of his father's murder, many people
did not want Alexander as their king.

291
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:38,450
He was still only twenty - too young, they
said, to take on the responsibility of Macedonian

292
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,179
rule.

293
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:46,049
He was half Epirote, not a true Macedonian,
because his mother was from Epirus.

294
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:54,340
And his Epirote mother was wild and irresponsible
- perhaps even her husband's murderer.

295
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,760
There were two other serious possibilities
for the next king.

296
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,789
One was General Attalus, Eurydice's uncle,
who wanted to rule Macedonia through Eurydice

297
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:07,340
and Philip's new baby son.

298
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,400
The other was Amyntas.

299
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,420
Twenty-three years earlier, Amyntas had been
a child of two when his father, King Perdiccas,

300
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,190
had died.

301
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:24,309
Philip was Perdiccas's younger brother and
had ruled in the place of his baby nephew;

302
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:29,800
when Amyntas became an adult, Philip was so
powerful and successful that nobody questioned

303
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,179
his right to continue ruling.

304
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,500
Amyntas was now twenty-five.

305
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:42,360
Compared to Alexander, he had the advantage
of age and experience, and his blood was equally

306
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,390
royal.

307
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,520
He was popular with the noblemen of Macedonia.

308
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,520
But Alexander stayed one step ahead of his
enemies.

309
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,600
He ordered the murder of Eurydice's baby,
his own half-brother.

310
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,570
General Attalus, who was with the army in
Asia, could do nothing to stop him.

311
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:08,070
Soon Attalus and Amyntas were murdered too.

312
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:13,830
This was not unusual - in those days the rule
of a new king almost always started with a

313
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,660
few murders.

314
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,429
Alexander reduced taxes for the people of
Macedonia and, since no other suitable kings

315
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:27,480
were left alive, they seemed happy to accept
him as their new ruler.

316
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,960
The situation was more difficult abroad.

317
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,590
When news of Philip's murder spread around
his empire, the tribes in the north and the

318
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:41,510
city-states in the south decided to free themselves
from Macedonian rule.

319
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:46,539
Within a few months of his fathers death,
Alexander had to fight to keep the empire

320
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:48,760
together.

321
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,960
He first went to the Greek state of Thessaly.

322
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,779
The usual route was along a narrow valley
in the mountains, but this was now guarded

323
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:59,880
by the Thessalians.

324
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,200
Alexander decided that it was too dangerous
to take the Macedonian soldiers and warhorses

325
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,380
this way.

326
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,909
Instead, he created a new path.

327
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:13,270
He ordered the soldiers to cut steps in the
steep rockface of a mountain on the border

328
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,300
between Macedonia and Thessaly.

329
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:21,610
After weeks of hard work, his army entered
Thessaly by the new road, took the Thessalians

330
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,300
by surprise and defeated them easily.

331
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,570
The Thessalians welcomed Alexander as their
new leader.

332
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:37,120
A march at lightning speed then took Alexanders
army on a tour of Greek city-states.

333
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,480
One by one, they realized that battle would
end in disaster, so they quickly made peace

334
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,779
with him instead.

335
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:50,770
Only Sparta refused to accept Alexander as
their leader, sending the message: 'It is

336
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:56,000
our fathers' habit not to follow others but
to lead them.'

337
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,280
Alexander was not too worried.

338
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,730
The rest of the Greeks hated Sparta more than
they hated Macedonia.

339
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,570
He could manage without Spartan help.

340
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,580
There were also problems in the north.

341
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,480
After his tour of Greece, Alexander had to
fight the Thracians, who lived beside the

342
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,620
River Danube.

343
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:22,220
They could not defeat Alexander's well-trained
army and soon they were forced to accept Macedonian

344
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,390
rule.

345
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,059
But bad news followed.

346
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:33,169
The Macedonian forces in Asia were retreating;
Attalus, murdered on Alexander's orders, had

347
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:38,799
been a good general, and his death had probably
weakened the army there.

348
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:45,899
In Macedonia itself, Olympias was behaving
typically and had murdered Eurydice.

349
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:52,131
And in Greece, news was spreading that Alexander
had been killed on the Danube; the city-state

350
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:59,690
of Thebes was leading a new fight for independence
which was fast growing out of control.

351
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,549
Alexander knew that he had to act quickly.

352
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:07,360
He rushed his army to Thebes and started a
siege of the city.

353
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,850
When an unguarded gate in the city wall was
found, the Macedonians soon forced their way

354
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,680
into the city.

355
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,210
Alexander called a meeting with the neighbouring
Greek city-states, who had for many years

356
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:25,360
suffered bad treatment at the hands of power-hungry
Thebes.

357
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,669
When he asked them what should happen to Thebes,
they voted to destroy it completely.

358
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:35,510
Thebes came to a violent end.

359
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,929
The city's riches were taken.

360
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:44,690
A few houses were left untouched - 150 years
earlier the Theban writer Pindar had written

361
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:51,190
poems for the Macedonian king, and now his
house was safe - but the rest were burnt to

362
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,670
the ground.

363
00:27:52,670 --> 00:28:00,700
30,000 Thebans, including women and children,
were taken prisoner and sold as slaves.

364
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,460
The terrible news soon spread around Greece.

365
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:11,159
No other city-state was interested in continuing
their fight for independence now.

366
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,350
Everyone rushed to prove that they were Alexander's
greatest allies.

367
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:21,700
At last Alexander could turn his attention
to Asia.

368
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:28,920
It was time to plan his war against the Persian
Empire.

369
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:35,220
Alexander called together forces from many
lands - foot soldiers from Illyria and Thrace,

370
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:41,250
horsemen from Thessaly, warships from Athens,
archers from Crete, as well as the highly

371
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,070
trained Macedonian army.

372
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:50,930
To this he added doctors, long-distance runners,
engineers, religious men, specialists in digging

373
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:59,169
for gold and jewels, and a historian called
Callisthenes to record his great achievements.

374
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:04,200
Alexander left his mother Olympias in charge
of Macedonia, with his father's loyal general

375
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,340
Antipater to lead her army.

376
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:12,120
Then he marched to the Dardanelles, a narrow
piece of water that separates Europe from

377
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,360
Asia in present-day Turkey.

378
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,690
While Alexander's second-in-command, General
Parmenion, led the mam army into Asia by the

379
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:27,529
shortest sea crossing, Alexander himself decided
to see some sights.

380
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:33,940
His destination was the ruined city of Troy,
scene of the legendary Trojan War, where Greeks

381
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,440
and Asians had fought for the first time.

382
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,840
The Greeks believed that the war had started
1,000 years before the time of Alexander,

383
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,409
when Paris, a Trojan prince, stole the beautiful
Helen from her Greek husband Menelaus.

384
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:49,409
***

385
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:56,480
Of all the heroes of the Trojan War, the greatest
was Achilles.

386
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,600
When he was a baby, his immortal mother had
held his heel and covered the rest of his

387
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,480
body in the water of the legendary River Styx.

388
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,910
After this, he could only be hurt on his heel.

389
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,750
Achilles grew up handsome and brave.

390
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:19,669
At the start of the Trojan War, his mother
gave him a choice: he could stay at home,

391
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:27,169
live a normal life and die an old man, or
he could go to Troy, die young and be famous

392
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:28,860
for ever.

393
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,419
Of course Achilles chose Troy.

394
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:38,190
He was the fastest runner and the strongest
fighter in the Greek army.

395
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,360
But he also had a quick temper.

396
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,409
After an argument about a female prisoner
with his general, Agamemnon, Achilles decided

397
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:49,679
to stop fighting in the war.

398
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,940
Without Achilles, the Greeks were nearly defeated.

399
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:59,179
Patroclus, Achilles's best friend, fought
in Achilles's armour to give the Greeks confidence;

400
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:03,010
but soon he was killed by the Trojan hero,
Hector.

401
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,679
Achilles felt very sad and very guilty.

402
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:09,310
It was his fault that his best friend was
dead.

403
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:16,250
Dressed in new armour created by the gods,
he returned to battle and did not stop fighting

404
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:20,039
until he had killed Patroclus's killer, Hector.

405
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:25,049
He tied Hector's body to his chariot and pulled
it through the dust.

406
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:30,169
But later in the war, Achilles himself was
killed when Paris shot him in the heel with

407
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:33,170
a poisoned arrow.

408
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:37,960
This was a story that Alexander had read from
his early childhood.

409
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,210
He was even thought to be a relative of Achilles,
through his mother, Olympias, and the royal

410
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,580
family of Epirus.

411
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,669
His teacher Aristotle had prepared for him
a special copy of The Iliad, Homer's great

412
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:57,260
poem about Achilles; this copy was so important
to Alexander that he liked to rest his head

413
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,940
on it when he slept.

414
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,980
For many years people had compared Alexander
and his best friend Hephaistion to Achilles

415
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,950
and Patroclus.

416
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:13,059
And now Alexander, like the Greeks of the
Trojan War, had come across the Dardanelles

417
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:16,440
to attack the people of Asia.

418
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,370
As Alexander's boat touched the beach, he
threw his spear at the ground as a sign that

419
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,419
this land was now his.

420
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:28,270
With his friends, he walked up the hill to
the ruins of Troy.

421
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,049
He gave gifts to the gods.

422
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:36,950
Then he and Hephaistion ran - Alexander to
the tomb of Achilles, his best friend to the

423
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,590
tomb of Patroclus.

424
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:45,519
Next he went to the temple of Athene, where
he exchanged his own armour for a shield which,

425
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,950
according to legend, had been used in the
Trojan War.

426
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:55,279
With his beautiful shield from the Age of
Heroes, he went to rejoin his army as the

427
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,800
new Achilles.

428
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,770
We can only wonder if he thought about the
choice of futures that Achilles had been given

429
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,039
by his mother.

430
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:10,010
Like Achilles, Alexander chose to fight battles
and live famously.

431
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:16,210
Did he guess that, like Achilles, he would
never return to his homeland or live to middle

432
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,659
age?

433
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:20,960
CHAPTER FOUR

434
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,880
First Battles in Asia

435
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,540
Until Alexander could prove that he was stronger
than the Persian Empire, the Greek cities

436
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,399
in Asia refused to help him.

437
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,080
He had very little food or pay left for his
men.

438
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,500
He needed to defeat the Persians in battle
quickly.

439
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,800
But the Persian commanders were discussing
other plans.

440
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:49,110
At this time, the soldiers in the Persian
army were mostly Greek.

441
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:55,511
People talk of Alexanders Greeks' defeating
the 'Persians', but there were 50,000 Greeks

442
00:33:55,511 --> 00:34:00,020
in the Persian army and only 7,000 in Alexander's.

443
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:05,700
In Greece, it was difficult to earn a living
if you did not own land.

444
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,020
There were plenty of slaves, so landowners
and businessmen rarely wanted to employ paid

445
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,020
workers.

446
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:18,200
The shipping business was a possibility, but
storms at sea were common and fortunes were

447
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,649
lost as often as they were made.

448
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:26,980
For many, the most attractive choice was a
life in the highly paid Persian army.

449
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,450
The army was full of failed Greek farmers
and businessmen, younger sons who owned no

450
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:37,409
land, and politicians who were not welcome
in the city of their birth.

451
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:44,530
A Greek general called Memnon had been responsible
for the Macedonians most recent defeats.

452
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:49,910
He had grown up on the island of Rhodes, spent
some time living in Macedonia, and come to

453
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:53,780
Asia fifteen years before Alexander.

454
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:59,631
His wife Barsine was Persian, and he now owned
a large farm, a present from the Persian king

455
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,830
for his loyal service.

456
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,660
Memnon now had a plan to defeat Alexander.

457
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,520
The Persians should not face the Macedonians
in battle, he advised.

458
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,870
Instead, they should burn their own farms
and make sure Alexander's army could get no

459
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,690
food.

460
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,730
If Alexander did not win a battle, the Greek
cities would not help him.

461
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,359
Soon his hungry soldiers would have to return
to Europe.

462
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,770
The rest of the Persian commanders disagreed
with Memnon.

463
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,520
Instead, they decided to defend their country
in battle.

464
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,770
The Persian army grouped on the east bank
of the River Granicus.

465
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:46,800
When Alexander heard the news, he realized
his luck and ordered his soldiers to march

466
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,860
there as quickly as possible.

467
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:55,230
Some of Alexander's advisers warned him that
for religious reasons it was not a good month

468
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,369
for a battle.

469
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:03,920
Alexander acted typically: he created a new
month.

470
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,869
Alexander and his army reached the Granicus
in late afternoon.

471
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:10,350
The Persians had chosen their position well.

472
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:16,560
The river was twenty metres wide and ran fast
between steep, muddy banks.

473
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,540
If Alexander ordered his army to cross the
river, it would be easy for the Persians to

474
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,290
cut them down in the mud.

475
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,920
Alexander had read in the work of a Greek
historian that the Persians liked to camp

476
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,630
some distance from their chosen battle ground
and did not march before the sun came up.

477
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:42,440
The Macedonians crossed the river in the early
hours of the morning and found it undefended.

478
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,960
They now had the advantage of surprise.

479
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,920
Alexander led his horsemen against the enemy.

480
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,109
The Persian horsemen fought back, but they
were badly organized because of the surprise

481
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:56,500
attack.

482
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:02,250
When Alexander's spear broke during the fighting,
a Persian commander saw his opportunity and

483
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,880
struck Alexander on the head.

484
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,990
But Alexander was not hurt, and before the
Persian could strike again, a Macedonian called

485
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:14,070
Cleitus came to protect his king.

486
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:23,160
Cleitus's sister had been Alexander's nurse
as a baby, and now Cleitus saved his life.

487
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,430
As the fighting continued, the Persians failed
to organize a strong defence.

488
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:33,730
Many of their commanders were killed, several
by Alexander himself.

489
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:38,020
Soon the Persians on horseback were retreating.

490
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:43,900
As the Macedonians surrounded the Persian
camp, about 17,000 hired Greek foot soldiers

491
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,060
tried to defend it.

492
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:51,750
They managed to hurt Alexander's horse, but
there were many more Macedonian attackers.

493
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:59,359
They could not hope to win. 2,000 were taken
prisoner, and later sent to Macedonia as slaves;

494
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,030
the rest were killed.

495
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:08,940
Alexander used this cruel treatment as a message
to other Greeks: 'Leave the Persian army and

496
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,690
stop fighting your own countrymen - if you
don't, your suffering will be worse than the

497
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,369
Persians'.'

498
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:21,849
After his success at the Granicus, the Greek
cities in Asia quickly opened their gates

499
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,859
to Alexander.

500
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:28,640
He sent messengers to all the cities that
he had already passed, telling them to become

501
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:36,180
democracies, to create their own laws, and
to stop paying tax to the Persian king.

502
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:41,880
This was a clever trick, because it made Alexander
popular with tax-payers.

503
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,630
The tax to the Persian king was not really
stopped; it was given a new name, and paid

504
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,950
as a 'gift' to the Macedonian army instead.

505
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,820
But the trick was successful.

506
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,911
The Persian-supported local rulers lost their
power without any danger to the Macedonian

507
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:00,240
army.

508
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,190
The cities became democratic, and Alexander
grew so popular that many people in the area

509
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:11,320
started to think of him as a god.

510
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,160
Alexander marched south into Caria, where
he had in the past hoped to marry the daughter

511
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,420
of his father's ally, the Carian king.

512
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:26,130
At the border, he was met by Queen Ada, who
had been the wife of an earlier king.

513
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:33,570
Now she was almost a prisoner in her own home
under the new king, a Persian called Orontobates.

514
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:39,790
She had a strange suggestion for Alexander:
he should become her adopted son and take

515
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:43,680
Orontobates's place as the true king.

516
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,420
But first he had to defeat King Orontobates.

517
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:53,270
Orontobates and General Memnon, who was then
commander of the whole Persian army, were

518
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:59,280
preparing a defence of Halicarnassus (now
called Bodrum, in Turkey).

519
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:05,790
The city was famous for its Mausoleum - the
great tomb of Ada's brother, King Mausolus,

520
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:09,820
which was one of the Seven Wonders of the
World.

521
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:15,640
Halicarnassus had the strongest city defences
on the Asian coast, circled by walls and with

522
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,230
a well-built castle.

523
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:24,530
Persian warships defended it by sea; Alexander,
who had sent his Athenian warships home a

524
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:31,190
few months earlier because they were so expensive,
had no warships at all.

525
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,960
The siege was difficult.

526
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,160
The Macedonians broke part of the city wall,
but the Persians pushed them back.

527
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,480
Many lives were lost from both armies.

528
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,320
In the end, the Persians had too few soldiers
to defend the city.

529
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,060
They retreated to the castle, which they held
for a year.

530
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:56,500
But Alexander was able to move his forces
into the main part of the city.

531
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:03,560
As Queen Ada's adopted son, Alexander became
king of Caria.

532
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,320
Preparations now had to be made for the winter.

533
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,940
Alexander decided to send home to Macedonia
all the soldiers who had married just before

534
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,920
the start of the war.

535
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,790
This was a popular decision.

536
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:22,109
Alexander's army now loved their leader more
than ever.

537
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:26,859
Alexander left his 'mother', Queen Ada, in
charge of Caria.

538
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:32,190
With the rest of the army, he marched to Gordium
(in central Turkey), and waited there for

539
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,990
the return of the newly married soldiers.

540
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:40,869
During the winter Alexander became interested
in a local legend.

541
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:45,650
In the palace at Gordium, which had in the
past been the home of the kings of Phrygia,

542
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,370
there was an old chariot.

543
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:53,810
It was tied to a piece of wood by a complicated
knot that no one had ever managed to untie.

544
00:41:53,810 --> 00:42:03,160
According to legend, Asia would one day be
ruled by the person who could untie the knot.

545
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,440
Alexander decided that he would untie the
knot.

546
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,960
In front of all his soldiers, he moved towards
the chariot.

547
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,630
After some minutes, the knot was broken.

548
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:19,420
But there were two different stories from
the people who were watching.

549
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:24,619
Some said that Alexander's success with the
knot was real; others said that they saw him

550
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:27,190
use his knife to cut it.

551
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,020
We will never know.

552
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:34,030
But that night the gods seemed to send a sign
of their support when thunder and lightning

553
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,410
filled the sky.

554
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:42,960
Word spread among his soldiers and the local
people: Alexander, who had untied the Gordian

555
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:50,829
Knot, was the future ruler of all Asia.

556
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:52,920
CHAPTER FIVE

557
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,510
Face to Face with Darius

558
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:02,490
While Alexander was at Gordium, the Persians
started to make more plans to defeat him.

559
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:07,930
The Macedonians had no warships; the Persians
had 300.

560
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:13,569
It was time for the Persians to take advantage
of their power at sea.

561
00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:18,829
Led by General Memnon, they took back the
Greek islands of Chios and Lesbos.

562
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:24,770
They planned to continue by sea towards central
Greece, and they hoped that Sparta would soon

563
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:29,040
lead a Greek independence movement against
the Macedonians.

564
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:37,160
If the Persians created enough problems in
Greece, Alexander would have to go home.

565
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,990
They also decided, finally, to burn all the
fields before Alexander reached them, so his

566
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,650
army would have nothing to eat.

567
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,000
Marching south, Alexander found burning fields
everywhere.

568
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,869
Then, when he got to the city of Tarsus (in
present-day southern Turkey), he became ill

569
00:43:55,869 --> 00:44:01,430
with a high fever, perhaps because of a swim
in an icy river.

570
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,420
His doctors feared for his life.

571
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,800
But a Greek doctor called Philip, who had
looked after Alexander as a boy, suggested

572
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,109
a treatment that might help.

573
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:16,770
As the doctor went to prepare the medicine,
Alexander was given a letter from General

574
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:22,231
Parmenion, his second-in-command; it said
that Philip had been paid by the Persian king

575
00:44:22,231 --> 00:44:24,450
to kill Alexander.

576
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:29,920
But when Philip returned with the medicine,
Alexander drank it immediately without questioning

577
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,850
his doctor's loyalty, and after several weeks
he got better.

578
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:41,740
In Alexander's world, death by poison was
not uncommon and the ability to know friend

579
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,349
from enemy was very useful.

580
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:49,780
Memnon was not as lucky as Alexander.

581
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:54,810
While fighting on Lesbos, he suddenly became
ill and died.

582
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:58,320
This was a serious problem for the Persians.

583
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,609
Without Memnon and his knowledge of Greece,
they did not feel confident that they could

584
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:07,619
fight a war successfully against the Macedonians
in Europe.

585
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:15,280
Although Memnon's plan had worked very well
until then, they decided to change it completely.

586
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:22,060
The Great King of Persia, Darius III, took
personal control of the situation.

587
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,680
We know little about this king.

588
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,819
Although he had royal blood, he was not a
close relative of the Persian kings that had

589
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:30,680
ruled before him.

590
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:36,579
He had been the governor of Armenia and fought
bravely in battles there; he had then become

591
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:42,869
king of Persia after many members of the royal
family were poisoned by a power-hungry politician

592
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:45,720
called Bagoas.

593
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:51,339
Persia itself was in present-day Iran, but
the Great King controlled all the lands from

594
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:57,230
Egypt to Pakistan, and from Uzbekistan to
the Arabian Sea.

595
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:02,559
His riches were legendary, and he received
the treatment of a god.

596
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:09,040
He was protected by a bodyguard of 10,000
soldiers; they were called the Immortals because

597
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:16,030
when one man died or became ill, his position
was immediately filled by another man.

598
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:20,200
The Great King gave land to the men that served
him well.

599
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,410
The land-owning Persians had a very comfortable
way of life that was often a subject of wonder

600
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,950
among the Greeks.

601
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:32,960
They had soft carpets on their floors and
beautiful gardens full of flowers; they ate

602
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,200
the finest food, and hundreds of servants
looked after all their needs.

603
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:44,079
But with one word, the all-powerful king could
take away their good fortune for ever.

604
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:50,150
Wide, well-built roads connected the Great
King's most important cities, Babylon, Susa

605
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,480
and Persepolis, with the far corners of his
empire.

606
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:01,080
The best of these roads was the Royal Road,
which led 2,300 kilometres from Susa, in the

607
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:06,050
heart of the empire, to Sardis, on the Mediterranean
coast.

608
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:10,530
Every twenty-five kilometres along the route,
there was a place to buy food and stay the

609
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,580
night.

610
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:18,180
Only the Greek cities in the west of the Persian
Empire paid tax in the form of money.

611
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:25,390
Everywhere else, tax to the Great King was
paid in food; in silver and gold; and in horses,

612
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,839
war chariots and fighting men.

613
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:32,800
King Darius now put together an enormous army.

614
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,960
Only the lands on the eastern borders of the
empire did not send men; they were too far

615
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,670
away to be useful.

616
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:47,069
The Persian army's strength lay in its well-trained
archers and horsemen, because riding and archery

617
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:51,500
were the traditional hobbies of the Persian
landowners.

618
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:56,630
Tens of thousands of these men joined their
king, but foot soldiers were less easy to

619
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:58,300
find.

620
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:04,710
Darius's army included a large number of teenage
boys with no experience of battle.

621
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:09,410
To help them, the King also called for the
hired Greek soldiers who had been fighting

622
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:16,670
with Memnon at sea; he needed them now for
a great land battle.

623
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:23,540
Historians at the time wrote that he had between
300,000 and 600,000 men in his army, but not

624
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:26,350
all of them were soldiers.

625
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:30,610
Each Persian horseman, for example, had twelve
servants.

626
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:36,430
And when the king commanded the army, his
politicians, his wives and his children came

627
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,040
with him.

628
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,660
The Macedonians, whose army only numbered
about 50,000 men, received reports that the

629
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:49,990
enemy had camped near the Syrian border with
Cilicia (southern Turkey).

630
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:54,829
They marched along the Mediterranean coast
towards the Persian camp, covering the distance

631
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:58,690
in half the usual time.

632
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:04,280
Unknown to Alexander, the Persians had left
their camp and were also marching.

633
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:09,440
While the Macedonians followed the coast road
south, the Persians followed the inland road

634
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,440
north.

635
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,620
Although they were only a few kilometres away
from each other, neither army knew where the

636
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,119
other one was.

637
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:23,280
Such confusion is hard to imagine today, in
a world where cameras in space can be used

638
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,869
to spy on every movement that an army makes.

639
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:33,830
The Macedonians realized first that the two
armies had passed each other by mistake.

640
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:37,150
They had already had several days of hard
marching.

641
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:43,880
Now Alexander asked his soldiers to turn round
and march again.

642
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,730
After an evening meal, they marched north
in the dark, had a short sleep, then marched

643
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:51,520
again at first light.

644
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,240
Around midday they came to a river near the
town of Issus.

645
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:02,619
On the far side of the river stood the Persian
army, on a flat piece of land about two kilometres

646
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:04,109
wide.

647
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:11,109
To the west there was beach and the Mediterranean
Sea; to the east there were mountains.

648
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:15,920
The fighting area was too narrow for Darius
to take advantage of his greater numbers of

649
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,010
soldiers.

650
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:21,370
It was a good battlefield for the Macedonians.

651
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:28,140
Alexander, riding Bucephalas, led a charge
of horsemen across the river towards the enemy.

652
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,849
The Persian horsemen rode to meet them, and
the battle began.

653
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:37,010
In the centre of the battlefield were the
Macedonian foot soldiers, who fought with

654
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:39,609
six-metre-long spears.

655
00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:44,099
Although they were difficult to defeat on
flat ground, the Macedonians were having problems

656
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:46,640
on the steep river banks.

657
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,390
They were close to defeat at the hands of
the hired Greek soldiers who fought for the

658
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,390
Persians.

659
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:58,480
But just in time, Alexander's horsemen broke
through the Persian line and came to help

660
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,579
the foot soldiers.

661
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:04,950
Soon the Macedonians were winning the battle.

662
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:08,740
King Darius was watching the fighting from
his chariot.

663
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:14,400
As Alexander and his Macedonian horsemen moved
towards him from two sides, the eyes of the

664
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,390
two kings met for a moment.

665
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:33,040
Then Darius, realizing that the battle was
lost, turned his chariot and quickly retreated.

666
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,410
CHAPTER SIX

667
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:37,819
South to Egypt

668
00:51:37,819 --> 00:51:43,460
Darius escaped over the mountains on horseback,
leaving his spear in his chariot.

669
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:48,150
But the Battle of Issus was a serious defeat
for the Persians.

670
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,589
Enormous numbers of Persians died.

671
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:56,030
The rest of the Persian army broke into small
groups, and most of the hired Greeks sailed

672
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:59,530
home in Persian warships.

673
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:04,010
King Darius lost much more than his soldiers
and ships.

674
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:09,530
The Macedonians found extraordinary riches
left near the battlefield, and even more at

675
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,200
the city of Damascus.

676
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:18,869
There were 220 kilograms of silver, and as
many gold coins as Alexander's father, King

677
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:24,020
Philip, had received in tax from his empire
in a whole year.

678
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:29,690
There were piles of cups, bowls and boxes
made of gold.

679
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:34,290
Alexander liked one gold box so much that
he decided to keep his favourite copy of The

680
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:36,630
Iliad in it.

681
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:45,849
There were thousands of servants, including
329 female musicians, 319 cooks and 70 wine

682
00:52:45,849 --> 00:52:50,340
waiters, who had come to look after the Great
King while he commanded the army.

683
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:59,180
And, most important of all, the Macedonians
took prisoner Darius's wife, mother and children.

684
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:03,520
Alexander made sure that the Persian royal
family received royal treatment.

685
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:10,060
They were given fine clothes and jewellery
to wear, and had a comfortable place to live.

686
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:14,880
Soon Darius wrote to Alexander asking for
his family's return.

687
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,270
But Alexander replied that the royal family
would only be freed if Darius called him King

688
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:22,430
Alexander of Asia.

689
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:29,270
'If you think you have a right to your empire,
stand and fight for it,' wrote Alexander.

690
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:36,250
'Do not run away, because I will come after
you, wherever you go.'

691
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:41,790
Another prisoner was the dead General Memnon's
beautiful Persian wife, Barsine.

692
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:47,280
She had lived for a short time in Macedonia
when her father, a Persian governor, had become

693
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,650
unpopular with the Persian king.

694
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:55,099
In Macedonia, Barsine had known Alexander
as a boy.

695
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:58,620
Now he was a man and she was his prisoner.

696
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:04,920
Alexander fell in love with her and they were
close for the next five years.

697
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,940
Alexander now needed to take the ports in
Phoenicia (present-day Lebanon).

698
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:15,670
Most of them were happy to welcome the Macedonians
and say goodbye to Persian rule, but the city

699
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:18,760
of Tyre was different.

700
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,670
Tyre stood on an island about a kilometre
out to sea and was ringed by a wall fifty

701
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,900
metres high.

702
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:32,299
Few cities were as difficult to attack, but
Alexander, as usual, wasted no time in worrying

703
00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:35,490
about the difficulty of his job.

704
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:41,540
He told his engineers to build a wide road
across the sea to the island of Tyre.

705
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:47,090
Using stone from coastal ruins to fill in
the sea, the first part of this road was built

706
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,270
quickly.

707
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:53,309
But the last 200 metres cost many lives.

708
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:59,440
The Tyrians shot arrows at the Macedonians
as they worked, but the Macedonians used stone-throwing

709
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,030
machines to clear the archers from their shooting
positions.

710
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:08,940
The machines were also used to make holes
in the city walls, but the walls were soon

711
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:09,980
rebuilt.

712
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:16,090
When the Tyrians sailed burning ships into
enemy lines to destroy the Macedonians' wooden

713
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:22,200
war machines, the Macedonians found other
ways to destroy the Tyrian defences.

714
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:27,440
The Macedonians tried to climb the walls,
but the Tyrians showered them with red hot

715
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,960
sand that poured inside their armour and burnt
their bodies horribly.

716
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:40,200
As time went on, Alexander was helped by other
Phoenician cities, and by the Greeks who lived

717
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,910
on Cyprus and Rhodes.

718
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:48,270
More than six months after the start of the
siege, the Macedonians and their allies attacked

719
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:53,369
the island on all sides with ships and machines
of war.

720
00:55:53,369 --> 00:55:58,560
Finally, Alexander and his soldiers managed
to fight their way over the walls.

721
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:02,650
The Tyrians defended themselves bravely, but
the city was taken.

722
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:09,289
10,000 Tyrians were killed and 30,000 were
sold as slaves.

723
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:13,619
The results of Alexander's siege can still
be seen.

724
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:17,569
Tyre exists today, but it is not on an island.

725
00:56:17,569 --> 00:56:22,119
The coastline was changed for ever by the
road that Alexander's soldiers built across

726
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:24,750
the sea.

727
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:30,250
South of Tyre, Alexander took the city of
Gaza after a two month siege.

728
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:34,150
The whole male population was killed.

729
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:39,150
Then Alexander tied the feet of their dead
king, Batis, to his chariot and pulled it

730
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,270
round the city.

731
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:47,559
His hero Achilles had done the same in The
Iliad, with the body of Patroclus's killer,

732
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:49,210
Hector.

733
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:55,140
Alexander then marched south to Egypt, a land
rich in gold and farmland.

734
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:00,610
In later years, when Rome was all-powerful
and had a city population of one million,

735
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:05,440
most of the Romans' food came from the valley
of the Nile.

736
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,470
The Egyptians were understandably proud of
their long history.

737
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:15,860
Their religion and their writing had begun
almost 3,000 years before the time of Alexander,

738
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,859
and their form of government had too.

739
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:24,280
The Egyptians had built extraordinary tombs
for their kings, or 'pharaohs'.

740
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:29,690
The greatest of these, the tomb of Khufu at
Giza, continued to be the tallest building

741
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:32,770
in the world until the nineteenth century.

742
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:38,740
But when it was built in the twenty-sixth
century BC, the Greeks had not yet even learnt

743
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,319
how to write.

744
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:45,869
For centuries, Egypt had been one of the most
powerful countries in the Middle East, but

745
00:57:45,869 --> 00:57:50,910
in 525 BC it had fallen under Persian rule.

746
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:56,910
Its people had never fully accepted this situation,
and had regularly fought for their independence.

747
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:01,539
Now they welcomed Alexander as their new ruler.

748
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:06,650
They were deeply religious, and they saw that
Alexander had a better attitude than the Persian

749
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,210
kings to the Egyptian gods.

750
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:12,790
They gladly made him their 'pharaoh'.

751
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:21,250
As Pharaoh, he was believed to be a living
god, son of the Egyptian creator-god Amun.

752
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:26,980
After spending time in Egypt's capital city
Memphis (near present-day Cairo), Alexander

753
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:30,119
travelled north to the mouth of the River
Nile.

754
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:35,349
There he organized the building of a new city,
Alexandria.

755
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:40,630
It was not the only city of that name; one
had already been built near Issus, and before

756
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:44,349
he died Alexander built more than twenty others.

757
00:58:44,349 --> 00:58:49,700
But this Alexandria was perhaps his greatest
gift to the future.

758
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:54,340
In the centuries that followed, it became
one of the Mediterranean world's most important

759
00:58:54,340 --> 00:59:00,400
centres of learning and of political and economic
power.

760
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,510
Leaving most of his army in Alexandria, Alexander
travelled 200 kilometres west along the Mediterranean

761
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,880
coast with a small group of soldiers.

762
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:16,240
He came to the Greek city of Paraitonion,
then turned south into the Libyan desert.

763
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,450
This time his destination was not an enemy
city - it was Siwah, home of the Libyan god

764
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:24,140
Ammon.

765
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:30,500
Siwah, in Libya, was known all over the Greek
world as a place where people could ask Ammon

766
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,440
for advice and receive an honest answer.

767
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,900
The answers were communicated to visitors
by Ammon's religious officials.

768
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:45,230
Ammon was connected with the Egyptian god
Amun and the Greek god Zeus.

769
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:49,650
It seems that Alexander had an important question
to ask the god.

770
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:54,490
But his journey across the desert to Siwah
almost cost him his life.

771
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:58,109
For four days the travellers were lost in
a sandstorm.

772
00:59:58,109 --> 01:00:02,670
They drank all their water and soon became
very thirsty.

773
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:08,010
But suddenly there were clouds in the sky
and it started to rain - 'not without the

774
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:12,309
help of the gods', according to Alexander's
friends.

775
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:18,240
They travelled at night, when it was cooler,
and soon they lost their way again.

776
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,619
This time, it was said, they were helped by
birds and snakes which showed them the right

777
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,049
direction.

778
01:00:24,049 --> 01:00:30,890
Finally, after more than a week in the desert,
they reached Siwah.

779
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:35,990
Alexander communicated privately with the
god Ammon, possibly about his hopes of becoming

780
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,270
King of Asia.

781
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:44,039
Later, in public, the religious men of Siwah
welcomed him as 'Son of Zeus'.

782
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:48,410
Was this just a Greek translation of the Pharaoh's
title, Son of Amun?

783
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:54,380
Or had they heard that Alexander's mother
Olympias sometimes told strange stories about

784
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:57,050
a god being her son's father?

785
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,289
We do not know.

786
01:00:58,289 --> 01:01:03,200
But certainly Alexander's visit to Siwah had
a powerful effect on him.

787
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:09,280
According to his soldiers, he started to believe
that he truly was the son of the great god

788
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,140
Zeus.

789
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:17,329
Like the Greek hero Hercules, he was more
than human; because of this, there was nothing

790
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:23,299
that he could not achieve.

791
01:01:23,299 --> 01:01:24,309
CHAPTER SEVEN

792
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:28,480
King of Asia

793
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,510
During the siege of Tyre, King Darius had
written another letter to Alexander.

794
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:39,660
He had offered him all the lands west of the
River Euphrates, a fortune in gold, and marriage

795
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:46,270
to his daughter; in exchange, Darius had asked
for peace and the return of his wife, mother

796
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,859
and children.

797
01:01:47,859 --> 01:01:53,059
It was a generous offer, but Alexander had
refused it.

798
01:01:53,059 --> 01:02:00,310
Darius then realized that he had no choice
- he had to fight again.

799
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:05,400
While Alexander was in Egypt, Darius called
together a new army.

800
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,700
Soldiers came from the farthest corners of
his empire, and it was a whole year before

801
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,680
the army was ready to fight.

802
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,150
Alexander marched from Egypt to Tyre and waited.

803
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:22,119
In his next battle, he wanted to defeat the
Persians completely, and he could not do this

804
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:25,589
against an incomplete army.

805
01:02:25,589 --> 01:02:30,310
To entertain his bored soldiers, he organized
the performance of Greek plays and musical

806
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:31,900
concerts.

807
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:37,279
Then finally the Macedonians marched east.

808
01:02:37,279 --> 01:02:42,619
By burning the Euphrates valley, the Persians
forced Alexander to take the only other possible

809
01:02:42,619 --> 01:02:44,480
route east.

810
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:51,799
This brought him to Darius's choice of battlefield:
Gaugamela, in present-day Iraq.

811
01:02:51,799 --> 01:02:56,329
Darius made sure that, unlike at Issus, the
battlefield was wide enough for him to take

812
01:02:56,329 --> 01:02:59,170
advantage of his enormous army.

813
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:04,000
Although Alexander had been joined by new
soldiers from Macedonia, Greece and the Asian

814
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,740
Mediterranean coast, these only took the place
of the men who had died.

815
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:16,980
Against Alexander's 7,000 horsemen and 40,000
foot soldiers, Darius's had 30,000 horsemen

816
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:22,819
and 200,000 foot soldiers to send into battle.

817
01:03:22,819 --> 01:03:27,559
At first Alexander planned to take the Persians
by surprise in the early morning.

818
01:03:27,559 --> 01:03:33,559
But when it became clear that Darius was expecting
them, the Macedonians took time to look carefully

819
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:36,029
at the battlefield.

820
01:03:36,029 --> 01:03:40,740
In the centre of the field, they saw that
spears had been stuck in the ground to hurt

821
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:43,960
any horses that ran at the enemy lines.

822
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:49,529
They saw elephants, a frightening sight for
men who had never met such enormous animals

823
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:53,619
before, and for their horses.

824
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:57,760
They also noticed that uneven ground had been
flattened to help the drivers of the famous

825
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,270
Persian war chariots.

826
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:06,020
Darius had 200 of these chariots, with spears
pointing out in front of the horses and long

827
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:09,130
knives fixed to the wheels.

828
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:14,119
It is unlikely that the ordinary Macedonian
soldiers were feeling confident before the

829
01:04:14,119 --> 01:04:15,160
battle.

830
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:21,130
The following morning, Alexander spoke to
his men and their confidence returned.

831
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:27,010
He called to the gods, 'If I am truly the
son of Zeus, you will defend us and help to

832
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:29,240
make us strong.'

833
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,780
Then he led the attack.

834
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:37,520
Horsemen and foot soldiers charged towards
the centre of the Persian line, then suddenly

835
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:41,790
turned right to an area where there were no
spears or elephants.

836
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:47,329
Darius's horsemen from the centre rushed to
meet them, but they were unable to surround

837
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:49,569
the Macedonians as they had hoped.

838
01:04:49,569 --> 01:04:53,650
Fighting hard, the Macedonians drove them
back.

839
01:04:53,650 --> 01:05:00,470
At the same time, the Persian chariots charged
at the foot soldiers in the Macedonian centre.

840
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:05,420
But Alexander's archers managed to kill many
of the chariot drivers before they reached

841
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:07,220
the soldiers.

842
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:12,630
When a chariot came close, the Macedonians
moved sideways and the chariot, which could

843
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:16,930
not turn quickly, went straight through the
hole in the line.

844
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:22,339
The chariots were not causing the damage that
Darius had hoped for.

845
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:26,930
On Alexander's left, the Persians broke through
the Macedonian defences.

846
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:31,520
But they did not use the situation to their
advantage.

847
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:38,260
Instead they went in search of the Persian
royal family and tried to free Darius's mother.

848
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:41,500
Now Alexander took his chance.

849
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:45,910
When the enemy horsemen had rushed to meet
the first Macedonian charge, they had left

850
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:50,260
a weak point in the centre of Darius's line.

851
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:54,760
Alexander attacked at this point, passing
the elephants and going straight towards the

852
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,910
chariot of the Persian king.

853
01:05:56,910 --> 01:06:04,380
Alexander, it is said, threw a spear at Darius,
but it missed and killed his chariot driver

854
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,380
instead.

855
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:12,110
Soon, as at Issus, Darius was rushing from
the battlefield in his chariot.

856
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:15,789
This time Alexander did not want him to escape.

857
01:06:15,789 --> 01:06:19,099
He took 2,000 horsemen and hurried after him.

858
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:24,190
But the dust made it difficult to see, and
many Persians were trying to follow their

859
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,180
king as well.

860
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:31,950
In the confusion, Hephaistion and many of
Alexander's other friends were hurt.

861
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:38,490
The Macedonians continued the chase at high
speed, but Darius managed to get away.

862
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:43,089
With the disappearance of their king, the
Persian soldiers were soon defeated.

863
01:06:43,089 --> 01:06:48,010
As at Issus, enormous numbers of Persians
died.

864
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:52,990
The Macedonians too lost many men, and more
than a thousand horses died in the battle

865
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:57,599
or from their race to catch Darius.

866
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:01,010
Alexander marched through rich farmland to
Babylon.

867
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:06,140
Its governor came to meet him, and offered
him the city without a fight.

868
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:12,109
Alexander entered the city gates in his chariot,
riding through streets covered with flowers.

869
01:07:12,109 --> 01:07:18,940
The Babylonians, like the Egyptians, had suffered
200 years of unpopular Persian rule, and welcomed

870
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:22,559
a change enthusiastically.

871
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,470
Alexander was careful not to follow the Persian
habit of insulting the Babylonian gods.

872
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:32,670
He gave gifts to the great god Bel Marduk,
and paid for the rebuilding of temples which

873
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:36,339
had been damaged under the Persians.

874
01:07:36,339 --> 01:07:39,589
He spent a few weeks relaxing in the great
city with his army.

875
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:45,099
He probably found time to visit the famous
Hanging Gardens - a park planted with trees

876
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:48,300
and flowers on many different levels.

877
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:54,440
Like the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, this
was one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

878
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:58,339
Alexander left Babylon to be ruled by its
Persian governor, who had fought against the

879
01:07:58,339 --> 01:08:02,660
Macedonians at Gaugamela just a short time
before.

880
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:07,339
Many people were surprised at this, thinking
that only Greek speakers should rule Alexander's

881
01:08:07,339 --> 01:08:08,960
new empire.

882
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,440
But later there were other Persian-born governors.

883
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,810
The next great city on Alexander's route east
was Susa.

884
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:22,330
The climate there was so hot, it was said,
that at midday snakes could not cross the

885
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:25,230
road for fear of being burnt by the sun.

886
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:31,230
But its people gave Alexander a warm welcome,
and its great riches made it an attractive

887
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:33,859
destination.

888
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:38,700
After sitting in the royal seat of gold in
Darius's palace, Alexander took control of

889
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:42,490
one and a half million kilograms of gold.

890
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:48,699
His financial difficulties at the start of
the war were now just a memory.

891
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:52,870
Then came Persepolis, in the heart of Persia
itself.

892
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:57,730
It was natural to expect the Persians to defend
their homeland.

893
01:08:57,730 --> 01:09:01,890
Alexander led a small group of horsemen and
foot soldiers through the mountains to defeat

894
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:06,029
any Persian forces that were defending the
mountain roads.

895
01:09:06,029 --> 01:09:11,230
The path was steep, narrow and covered in
snow.

896
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:16,920
After four days' climb, the Macedonians came
to the Persian Gates, a wall of rock in the

897
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,219
mountains that marked the entrance to the
Persian homeland.

898
01:09:21,219 --> 01:09:25,890
As they passed, they were attacked by an enemy
army which was much larger than their own

899
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:27,830
small group.

900
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,949
Great stones fell on top of them from the
mountain heights, and they were shot at on

901
01:09:31,949 --> 01:09:35,890
all sides by Persian archers and stone-throwers.

902
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:40,870
Alexander had no choice: he had to order a
retreat.

903
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:46,310
If Alexander left these Persians undefeated,
they could attack his main army, led by his

904
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:49,540
second-in-command, Parmenion, on its way to
Persepolis.

905
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:55,720
There was only one hope of success, but it
was very dangerous.

906
01:09:55,720 --> 01:10:00,699
With half his soldiers, Alexander followed
a local guide along a small path used only

907
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:02,699
by animals and their owners.

908
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:09,820
At night, as the wind blew snow in their faces,
they ran through the mountains.

909
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:14,750
In the early morning, they rejoined the main
path beyond the Persians' position and took

910
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:17,370
the Persians by surprise.

911
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:23,060
With Macedonians in front and behind them,
the Persians suffered a terrible defeat.

912
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:25,540
Only a few escaped death.

913
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:31,870
Finally, in January 330 BC, Persepolis lay
undefended.

914
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:36,560
Alexande's soldiers moved through the city,
destroying everything and everyone in their

915
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,910
path in their search for riches.

916
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:45,040
For many, the long journey from Europe was
now well rewarded, as they found extraordinary

917
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,570
quantities of gold and silver, jewellery and
expensive clothes.

918
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:54,330
But the greatest riches were saved for the
Macedonian king.

919
01:10:54,330 --> 01:11:00,480
At Persepolis, Alexander found three million
kilograms of royal Persian gold.

920
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:09,090
It took 15,000 animals to move it, under Alexander's
orders, to Susa.

921
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:13,630
Alexander chose a new governor for Persepolis
- a Persian nobleman whose father had been

922
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:16,290
killed at the Granicus.

923
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:21,260
It seemed that Persepolis was going to receive
similar treatment to Babylon and Susa.

924
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:27,560
Then, after a celebratory meal, the Athenian
girlfriend of Alexander's friend Ptolemy made

925
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,239
a suggestion.

926
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:34,120
Alexander should burn the palace where they
were eating, she said, to punish the Persians

927
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,909
for burning the Athenian Acropolis many years
before.

928
01:11:38,909 --> 01:11:44,310
Alexander and his friends agreed, and soon
the historic palace of the kings of Persia

929
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:46,740
was in flames.

930
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:52,980
While Alexander was in Persepolis, Darius
and about 10,000 soldiers waited 700 kilometres

931
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,860
north in Ecbatana (present-day Hamadan).

932
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:02,370
But when Alexander led his army north, Darius
ordered a retreat.

933
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:07,909
First he planned to go far away to Bactria
(part of present-day Afghanistan); then he

934
01:12:07,909 --> 01:12:12,620
decided to defend the Caspian Gates, which
were much closer.

935
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:16,430
His men were getting annoyed with these changes
of plan.

936
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:20,850
Eventually some of them took their king prisoner.

937
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:25,520
When Alexander heard what had happened, he
followed as quickly as he could.

938
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:30,989
Racing through the desert, by day and night,
he finally caught up with the Persian soldiers.

939
01:12:30,989 --> 01:12:34,090
But their prisoner king was not with them.

940
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:39,449
Tired and thirsty after the long and unsuccessful
chase, one of Alexander's officers left the

941
01:12:39,449 --> 01:12:41,660
road in search of water.

942
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:44,300
By chance he found a dead body.

943
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:49,260
It was King Darius, murdered by his own men.

944
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:56,400
Exactly 150 years after King Xerxes's wrongdoings
in Athens, the rule of the Persian kings was

945
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,120
at an end.

946
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:04,110
Alexander started wearing the Great King's
royal hat and purple-edged clothes, making

947
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:09,430
it clear to the Persians that he was now their
Great King.

948
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:14,030
It was a shock for the Macedonians to see
their king in Persian clothes.

949
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:17,640
They did not understand why he wanted to look
like the enemy.

950
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:22,400
They had won battles that no one had expected
them to win, and had become rich beyond their

951
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,770
wildest dreams.

952
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:28,680
Now their thoughts turned to home.

953
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:34,080
To his soldiers' surprise, Alexander made
no plans to go back to Europe.

954
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:39,230
Instead he continued to march east, and it
is a sign of his extraordinary skills as a

955
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:46,230
leader that his soldiers agreed to follow.

956
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:47,730
CHAPTER EIGHT

957
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:51,730
To the Ends of the Earth

958
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:56,080
The first aim was to defeat Bessus, one of
Darius's murderers.

959
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:00,900
Bessus was now in Bactria, calling himself
King of Asia.

960
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:07,330
General Parmenion, Alexander's second-in-command,
stayed in Ecbatana with 25,000 men.

961
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:13,030
Cleitus, who had saved Alexander's life at
the Battle of the Granicus, was given 6,000

962
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:17,090
foot soldiers and was told to protect the
gold in the city.

963
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:24,290
The other 32,000 soldiers in the Macedonian
army marched with Alexander towards Bactria.

964
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:30,290
The quiet complaints about Alexander's new
Persian habits now grew more serious.

965
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:34,080
A group of Macedonians planned to murder their
king.

966
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:40,040
Philotas, son of General Parmenion and commander
of the Macedonian horsemen, was told about

967
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:44,020
these plans but failed to warn Alexander.

968
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:49,949
When the murder plans were eventually known,
Philotass earlier silence seemed strange.

969
01:14:49,949 --> 01:14:53,520
People began to wonder if the murder had been
his idea.

970
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,740
Philotas was found guilty and killed.

971
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:03,489
We know that Philotas was a powerful commander
who had openly criticized Alexander.

972
01:15:03,489 --> 01:15:07,510
We do not know if he was really responsible
for the murder plans.

973
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:14,330
Now, though, Alexander had real cause to worry,
because Philotass father, General Parmenion,

974
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:19,060
controlled half of the army at the time of
his son's death.

975
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:23,810
It was possible that Parmenion would turn
against Alexander in anger at the treatment

976
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:32,750
of his son; it was even possible that Parmenion
himself had made the plans to murder Alexander.

977
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:36,380
Alexander could not afford to wait and see
what Parmenion would do.

978
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:41,990
Instead, he organized the murder of this great
general, who had been such an important commander

979
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:48,300
in the Macedonian army since the days of Alexander's
father, King Philip.

980
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:52,150
After this, Alexander was very careful.

981
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:55,630
His soldiers' letters to their families were
secretly opened.

982
01:15:55,630 --> 01:16:00,590
A special group of soldiers was formed of
people who had criticized the king.

983
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:04,520
In this way, their dangerous views could not
spread to other soldiers who were still loyal

984
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,830
to Alexander.

985
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:12,430
In future battles these soldiers fought especially
bravely, to prove that they deserved to stay

986
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:17,100
with the army and not be left behind.

987
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:22,450
After these unpleasant events, the Macedonians
marched again towards Bactria.

988
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:28,870
Their route took them straight over the mountains
now called the Hindu Kush ('Killer of Hindus').

989
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:32,060
They climbed 3,000 metres through snow and
ice.

990
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:37,320
The army suffered terribly from cold and hunger,
and found it difficult to breathe in the thin

991
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,730
air.

992
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:42,199
Alexander walked beside his soldiers, helping
men

993
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:44,020
who had fallen.

994
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:49,700
The horses suffered most, and were eventually
killed and eaten - uncooked, as no firewood

995
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:54,120
could be found under the thick blanket of
snow.

996
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,560
Finally they arrived in Bactria.

997
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,210
Bessus, who had not expected Alexander's winter
crossing of the Hindu Kush, decided to retreat

998
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:04,950
beyond the River Oxus.

999
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:11,110
Most of his soldiers left his army, annoyed
that he did not want to stand and fight.

1000
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:16,230
Alexander took Bactria's capital city, Bactra,
then marched in the footsteps of the retreating

1001
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:17,700
Bessus.

1002
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:22,370
Two months before, his men were freezing.

1003
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:26,580
Now they had to suffer the terrible heat of
a stony desert.

1004
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:30,760
They travelled eighty kilometres with almost
no water.

1005
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:34,540
Alexander shared their suffering, refusing
to drink a small cup of water that had been

1006
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,739
found for him.

1007
01:17:36,739 --> 01:17:40,639
Soon they reached the River Oxus.

1008
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:45,420
Bessus had destroyed all the bridges and boats,
so Alexander ordered his men to fill their

1009
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:51,860
leather tent-bags with dried grass and use
them to sail across the wide river.

1010
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:57,360
On the far side, they discovered that, like
Darius before him, Bessus had been taken prisoner

1011
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,719
by his own men.

1012
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:03,040
Now he was given to Alexander.

1013
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:07,660
Alexander sent him back to Ecbatana, where
his ears and nose were cut off and he was

1014
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:09,880
later killed.

1015
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:14,239
This was the traditional Persian punishment
for killing a king.

1016
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:19,520
To please his new Persian allies, Alexander
was punishing the murderer of Darius, who

1017
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:25,150
he himself had wanted to kill for so many
years.

1018
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:29,120
Alexander now learnt of trouble in the lands
that he had already conquered.

1019
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:35,330
The people of Sogdiana (present-day Uzbekistan)
and Bactria were angry at the way that Alexander's

1020
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:41,600
hungry army had taken food and animals from
their farms, and started fighting for their

1021
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,600
independence.

1022
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,120
There were sieges in seven cities.

1023
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:51,230
Eventually the cities were taken, the enemy
soldiers killed, and the women and children

1024
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:54,000
sold into slavery.

1025
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,350
Then news came of trouble at the city of Maracanda
(now Samarkand).

1026
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:04,290
The Macedonian soldiers there were surrounded
by an enemy siege.

1027
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:06,790
Alexander had to send an army to help them.

1028
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:12,010
But the Scythians on the far side of the River
Jaxartes seemed dangerous too.

1029
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:20,780
He decided to send only a small force to Maracanda,
and to use his main army to defeat the Scythians.

1030
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:26,770
His own battle against the Scythians was successful,
and their leaders were soon asking for peace.

1031
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:30,950
But in Maracanda, the situation went from
bad to worse.

1032
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:34,300
The Macedonians were met by enemy horsemen.

1033
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:39,060
Without Alexander to lead them, they fought
badly, were forced onto a river island and

1034
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:40,870
were killed.

1035
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:43,180
More than 2,000 men were lost.

1036
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:48,860
It was the first real defeat that Alexander's
army had suffered.

1037
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:55,040
Alexander spent the summer of 328 BC trying
to win back control of Sogdiana.

1038
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:59,890
Before he had fully succeeded, a terrible
argument started over dinner one night.

1039
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:04,350
It was between Alexander and Cleitus, the
man who had saved Alexander's life at the

1040
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:07,080
Battle of the Granicus.

1041
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:11,950
It is possible that the argument was about
Alexander's attitude to his older commanders,

1042
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:15,480
and to his dead father Philip's memory.

1043
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:21,060
Since his visit to Siwah, Alexander believed
that he was the son of the god Zeus; perhaps

1044
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:27,080
Cleitus thought that Alexander was forgetting
the importance of his human father.

1045
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:32,750
Certainly many insults were exchanged, and
in the end Alexander killed Cleitus with a

1046
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,350
spear.

1047
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:40,160
In the morning, Alexander felt terrible about
losing his temper so violently.

1048
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:43,950
He went to his tent and refused to come out
for several days.

1049
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:47,679
But the murder could not be undone.

1050
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:51,739
After this, it seems likely that his relationship
with his commanders was different.

1051
01:20:51,739 --> 01:20:56,250
Cleitus had been killed because he had criticized
the king.

1052
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:59,949
Nobody else wanted to die for the same reason.

1053
01:20:59,949 --> 01:21:02,880
The war, though, started to go better after
this.

1054
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:09,000
The Sogdians, led by Oxyartes, waited behind
steep hilltop defences.

1055
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,570
They told Alexander that they would only become
his allies if he could find soldiers with

1056
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:14,800
wings.

1057
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:20,580
Instead, he chose 300 soldiers to climb the
rockface during the night, just like modern

1058
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:22,429
rock climbers.

1059
01:21:22,429 --> 01:21:26,040
They climbed to a position above the Sogdians.

1060
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:30,699
When the Sogdians woke up and saw the rock
climbers, they thought for a moment that the

1061
01:21:30,699 --> 01:21:33,830
Macedonian army really had grown wings.

1062
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:37,540
They immediately accepted defeat and were
taken prisoner.

1063
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:43,440
Among the prisoners was Oxyartes's beautiful
daughter Roxane.

1064
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,750
Alexander fell in love with her and soon they
were married.

1065
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:49,410
Politically, this was a good idea too.

1066
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:55,270
Oxyartes was a powerful nobleman in Sogdiana,
and now he had a strong reason to stay loyal

1067
01:21:55,270 --> 01:21:58,120
to Alexander.

1068
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,160
Others were less loyal.

1069
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,810
Alexander soon learnt of another plan to murder
him.

1070
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:09,160
Callisthenes, who was a pupil and close relative
of Aristotle and was writing the history of

1071
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:15,900
Alexanders heroic adventures, was blamed for
the plan and killed.

1072
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:21,490
Beyond Bactria lay India (present-day Pakistan
as well as India).

1073
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:26,820
Very few Greeks had ever been there, but many
strange stories were told of this mysterious

1074
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:28,219
land.

1075
01:22:28,219 --> 01:22:33,910
People said that it was rich in gold, which
was dug by enormous insects, and that Indian

1076
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:36,159
wool grew on trees.

1077
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:40,760
(Cotton was not known in the Mediterranean
area at that time.)

1078
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:47,330
They said that people lived for 200 years;
that there was a tribe of one-footed men;

1079
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:53,810
and that to the east of India lay the Eastern
Ocean, the edge of the world.

1080
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:58,520
Alexander led his army east into India, more
for the adventure than to build an empire.

1081
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:03,460
By now, the soldiers were mostly Asian, not
European.

1082
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:08,371
Asian Greeks from the eastern Mediterranean,
and Bactrian, Sogdian and Scythian horsemen

1083
01:23:08,371 --> 01:23:10,410
and archers.

1084
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:15,950
But his most important commanders were his
loyal childhood friends, including Perdiccas,

1085
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:18,280
Ptolemy and Seleucus.

1086
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:23,120
His best friend, Hephaistion, was now his
second-in-command.

1087
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:27,790
At first Alexander was surprised by the warm
welcome that he was given.

1088
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:33,050
A group of Indian kings asked to be his allies
and sent him twenty-five elephants to use

1089
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,810
in battle.

1090
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:37,540
But other tribes were not as welcoming.

1091
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:41,870
One after the other, their cities were taken
and their people killed, until most of the

1092
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:45,700
local kings accepted Alexander as their conqueror.

1093
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:49,640
If they did this, they were allowed to continue
their rule in peace.

1094
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:53,520
But one king, Porus, preferred to fight.

1095
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:58,250
He positioned his army and more than a hundred
war elephants on the far bank of the River

1096
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,690
Hydaspes.

1097
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:05,250
Alexander's horses were frightened of elephants,
and because it was the rainy season the river

1098
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:08,330
was very deep and fast.

1099
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:12,920
Alexander could not cross the river and hope
for an easy battle.

1100
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:18,180
Every night, Alexander's soldiers pretended
to start an attack, shouting the Macedonian

1101
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:21,800
war cry 'Alalalalai'.

1102
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:26,760
Every night, Porus's men got ready to defend
themselves, but as soon as the enemy had got

1103
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:31,429
out of bed, Alexander stopped his 'attack'.

1104
01:24:31,429 --> 01:24:35,179
Soon Porus's men were suffering badly from
too little sleep.

1105
01:24:35,179 --> 01:24:40,510
Porus saw that Alexander had collected enough
food to feed his men until the end of the

1106
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:45,780
rainy season, and decided that in fact he
was not planning to cross the river for many

1107
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,139
months.

1108
01:24:47,139 --> 01:24:52,369
He ordered his men not to listen to the nightly
Macedonian warcries.

1109
01:24:52,369 --> 01:24:55,080
Then Alexander attacked.

1110
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:59,350
On a rainy night, he sailed across the river
about twenty-five kilometres away from the

1111
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:00,980
main armies.

1112
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:06,780
His boats landed on an island in the middle
of the river, not on the tar bank.

1113
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:10,619
By the time the mistake was discovered, it
was almost light.

1114
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:13,800
There was no time to go back to the boats.

1115
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:18,700
Instead, Alexander climbed onto the back of
his horse Bucephalas, who walked the rest

1116
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:22,440
of the crossing with water up to his shoulders.

1117
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:27,850
Alexander's soldiers followed, some on horseback
and some on foot.

1118
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:33,219
Soon the fastest of Porus's soldiers arrived,
but their chariots got stuck in mud and they

1119
01:25:33,219 --> 01:25:35,710
were quickly defeated.

1120
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:42,380
Then Alexander marched on Porus's main army,
twenty-five kilometres away.

1121
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:46,880
At the front of Porus's battle line were the
elephants.

1122
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,170
Alexander's friends Hephaistion and Perdiccas
led horsemen to the far left of the line,

1123
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:57,699
beyond the elephants, and Porus's men moved
to meet their attack.

1124
01:25:57,699 --> 01:26:03,639
Then Alexander sent soldiers to attack their
right, which was almost undefended.

1125
01:26:03,639 --> 01:26:08,909
Soon Porus's army was in a state of confusion,
and many fighters used their elephants for

1126
01:26:08,909 --> 01:26:10,690
protection.

1127
01:26:10,690 --> 01:26:17,120
While Alexander's archers shot at the elephants'
drivers, his foot soldiers cut at their legs.

1128
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:22,409
The elephants went mad, picking men up and
throwing them violently to the ground.

1129
01:26:22,409 --> 01:26:27,070
Then, frightened and tired, they walked slowly
backwards.

1130
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:30,409
The battle had ended.

1131
01:26:30,409 --> 01:26:34,869
For Alexander, there was just one sad result
of the battle.

1132
01:26:34,869 --> 01:26:39,330
Bucephalas was hurt by Porus's chariots soon
after he had crossed the river.

1133
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:43,280
A few hours later, he died.

1134
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:48,230
Alexander built a new city on the banks of
the river and called it Bucephala, in memory

1135
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:52,360
of his much-loved horse.

1136
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:57,270
Alexander's army continued east, through the
mud of the Punjab's rainy season.

1137
01:26:57,270 --> 01:27:03,139
When rivers broke their banks, the men had
to escape the water in local hilltop villages.

1138
01:27:03,139 --> 01:27:08,159
The snakes of the area did the same, and many
men died from the poisonous bites of snakes

1139
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:13,380
hiding in tents, clothes and cooking pots.

1140
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:18,730
They reached the banks of the River Hyphasis,
and at this point a local king gave Alexander

1141
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:21,440
some unwelcome information.

1142
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:26,020
They were still a long way from the Eastern
Ocean, which for Greeks meant the edge of

1143
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:27,660
the world.

1144
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:33,040
To get there, they had to cross the River
Ganges, more than five kilometres wide, and

1145
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:38,960
fight the powerful King of Maghada and his
4,000 elephants.

1146
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,680
Alexander was not especially worried by this
news.

1147
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:47,540
He had defeated elephants before, and destroyed
an empire greater than Maghada's.

1148
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:52,560
He called his men together and told them about
the adventures and achievements that the future

1149
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,590
held.

1150
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:58,100
But his men greeted his words with silence.

1151
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:02,670
Some of them had marched 18,000 kilometres
since they had first arrived in Asia.

1152
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:07,020
They had not seen their families for eight
long years.

1153
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:13,100
And after three terrible months of rain, they
were muddy, wet and tired.

1154
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:17,820
They did not want to cross the Hyphasis and
attack another great empire.

1155
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:20,440
They wanted to go home.

1156
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:25,600
Finally, one of the commanders told Alexander
their feelings.

1157
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,469
Soon all the commanders refused to continue
east.

1158
01:28:29,469 --> 01:28:34,640
The first personal defeat in Alexander's life
came from his own army.

1159
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:37,510
He realized that he had no choice.

1160
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:42,989
Many of his men had tears in their eyes as
they heard the good news: Alexander was going

1161
01:28:42,989 --> 01:28:45,700
to lead them home.

1162
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:49,480
In his tent, Alexander was not as happy as
his men.

1163
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:53,460
His defeat had been very public, and it hurt
him greatly.

1164
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:57,900
There was a philosopher called Anaxarchus
who was travelling with the army.

1165
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:00,290
He tried to make Alexander feel better.

1166
01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:05,250
But according to legend, Alexander cried when
Anaxarchus talked about the number of worlds

1167
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:07,140
beyond the stars.

1168
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:13,699
He explained his tears: 'There are so many
worlds, and I have not yet conquered even

1169
01:29:13,699 --> 01:29:17,980
one.'

1170
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:19,119
CHAPTER NINE

1171
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:22,530
The Last Years

1172
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:25,860
Alexander refused to go back the way that
he had come.

1173
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:31,820
His taste for adventure was satisfied a little
when his men agreed, instead, to build boats.

1174
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:37,130
They planned to follow the Hydaspes and Indus
rivers south to the Arabian Sea.

1175
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:45,100
The journey started well, but it was difficult
to sail so many boats on unfamiliar waters.

1176
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:49,521
When the river was too fast, the boats lost
control, and many crashed into each other

1177
01:29:49,521 --> 01:29:50,580
and broke.

1178
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:56,660
On one occasion, Alexander had to swim for
his life.

1179
01:29:56,660 --> 01:30:00,120
Alexander wanted to conquer all the tribes
that he passed.

1180
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:05,830
The Malloi, who lived in and around the city
of Multan, caused him the most trouble.

1181
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:09,179
With a small force, Alexander surrounded Multan.

1182
01:30:09,179 --> 01:30:11,469
Then he led an attack on the city walls.

1183
01:30:11,469 --> 01:30:15,350
He climbed a ladder and jumped down inside
the city.

1184
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:20,190
But the enemy managed to break the rest of
the Macedonian ladders, and only three of

1185
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:22,840
his bodyguards were able to follow him.

1186
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:27,199
They fought bravely, but they were attacked
on three sides.

1187
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:31,250
Other Macedonians arrived as quickly as they
could, climbing on each other's shoulders

1188
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:33,830
to get to the top of the walls.

1189
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:38,850
But when they reached their king, he had a
metre-long arrow deep in his chest.

1190
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:43,240
They defeated his attackers, then carried
him away on his shield, but they had little

1191
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:46,000
hope that he would live.

1192
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:52,620
The Malloi were killed - men, women and children
- and the other tribes rushed to accept defeat

1193
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:54,270
peacefully.

1194
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:59,389
But news reached the main army on the river
that Alexander was dead.

1195
01:30:59,389 --> 01:31:05,910
When he finally arrived, not only alive but
able to ride and walk, they cried with happiness.

1196
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:11,870
They thought that Alexander must truly be
protected by the gods.

1197
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:15,860
Alexander's soldiers fought bloody battles
against the Brahmins, which brought the total

1198
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:21,520
number of Indian dead in the last six months
to a quarter of a million.

1199
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:26,560
Then the rainy season began again, and there
were terrible storms.

1200
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:31,480
When they finally reached the Arabian Sea,
they gave thanks to the gods.

1201
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:37,220
They did not know that the most difficult
part of their journey was still ahead of them.

1202
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:43,410
Two hundred years before, the Persian king
Cyrus the Great had lost a whole army in the

1203
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:45,790
Gedrosian Desert.

1204
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:51,480
The desert, now called the Makran, covers
62,000 square kilometres of present-day southern

1205
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,600
Pakistan and Iran.

1206
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,660
And their route led across it.

1207
01:31:56,660 --> 01:32:02,500
Alexander led a force by land, carrying water
for the men who sailed the ships.

1208
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:06,370
Alexander's friend Nearchus was in charge
of the ships, which brought food for the land

1209
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:08,060
army.

1210
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:12,140
It was impossible to pull enough food for
everyone through the sand of the desert.

1211
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:15,199
The sailors and soldiers needed each other.

1212
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:20,090
But the storms of the rainy season delayed
the ships after Alexander's army had already

1213
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:22,330
entered the desert.

1214
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:27,030
Then the local people started fighting, and
the ships were unable to take on board all

1215
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:29,810
the food that they needed.

1216
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:35,070
In the desert, the sand was deep and the soldiers'
legs sank into it.

1217
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:40,920
It had been blown into steep mountains and
valleys, so every kilometre felt like ten.

1218
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,790
Occasionally they came to a watering-place.

1219
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:49,369
There, thirsty men dived into the water and
drank so greedily that they died.

1220
01:32:49,369 --> 01:32:55,170
The expected rains came late, and when they
did, they arrived very forcefully.

1221
01:32:55,170 --> 01:33:00,700
Most of the women, children and animals following
the army were washed away and killed.

1222
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:05,310
The Gedrosian Desert was a hell on earth.

1223
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:07,830
Soon the men started to die of hunger.

1224
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:12,230
If they left the army in search of food, they
were likely to be killed by poisonous plants

1225
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:14,389
or snakes.

1226
01:33:14,389 --> 01:33:17,610
Then they discovered that their guides had
lost their way.

1227
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:23,640
Eventually, eight weeks after entering the
desert, they came out on the other side.

1228
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:27,040
But the desert had proved a much stronger
enemy than an army.

1229
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:32,989
Tens of thousands of men, women and children
had died on the march.

1230
01:33:32,989 --> 01:33:38,449
At this time, Nearchus and the ships were
only just leaving India.

1231
01:33:38,449 --> 01:33:43,060
They too were hungry and thirsty on their
journey, but Nearchus led them well and they

1232
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:45,030
lost few men.

1233
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:50,620
Eventually, the ships reached Carmania (in
present-day southern Iran), on the far side

1234
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:54,050
of the desert, and Alexander was there to
welcome them.

1235
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:57,730
There were wild celebrations.

1236
01:33:57,730 --> 01:34:04,830
Sailors and soldiers were together again,
and they knew that they were lucky to be alive.

1237
01:34:04,830 --> 01:34:09,190
When Alexander had marched over the Hindu
Kush, few Persians had believed that he would

1238
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:11,310
ever return.

1239
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:16,619
Since then, there had been stories that he
had died in Multan or in the Gedrosian Desert.

1240
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:23,310
They were very surprised when he arrived in
Carmania, an easy march from Persepolis.

1241
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:27,900
Few of the conquered lands had stayed loyal
in the six years since the Battle of Gaugamela.

1242
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:32,430
Some governors had become disloyal as soon
as Alexander had left.

1243
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:38,239
Others, including the governor of Babylon
and Queen Ada of Caria, had died of illness

1244
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:43,020
or in battle, and disloyal men had taken their
place.

1245
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:48,520
Many Greeks and Macedonians had been left
as the populations of Alexander's new cities;

1246
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:52,350
some had hated their new life and killed their
governors.

1247
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:57,850
And in Ecbatana, a group of Alexander's generals
had behaved very badly, insulting the local

1248
01:34:57,850 --> 01:35:02,620
religion and attacking the local noblewomen.

1249
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:06,390
Alexander punished his disloyal governors
and generals with death.

1250
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:12,020
He chose new governors from among his European
commanders; too few of his Persian appointments

1251
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:15,650
had been a success.

1252
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:22,179
Alexander next planned a great wedding celebration,
choosing Persian wives for ninety of his officers.

1253
01:35:22,179 --> 01:35:27,100
He himself was already married to Roxane,
but he decided to follow royal Macedonian

1254
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:34,250
tradition and take two more wives: the eldest
daughters of Persia's most recent kings, Darius

1255
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:37,050
and Artaxerxes.

1256
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:42,710
He asked his best friend, Hephaistion, to
marry Darius's younger daughter, so that Hephaistion's

1257
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:46,270
children could be his own nephews.

1258
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:51,420
The weddings were celebrated for five days,
in an enormous tent in Susa that had been

1259
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:55,480
richly decorated with gold and jewels.

1260
01:35:55,480 --> 01:36:00,420
Alexander had taken the power of government
away from the Persians; now he was including

1261
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:04,500
them in his empire in another way.

1262
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:09,750
More and more soldiers from the eastern half
of the empire were joining Alexander's army.

1263
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:14,400
When he asked his oldest Macedonian soldiers
to go home, they felt insulted that he did

1264
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,700
not need them any more.

1265
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:22,350
After ten years in Asia, they now wanted to
stay and enjoy the lands that they had conquered.

1266
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:25,300
They refused to leave.

1267
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:28,230
The rest of the Macedonian soldiers supported
them.

1268
01:36:28,230 --> 01:36:34,180
'If you send the old soldiers home, you must
send us all,' they told Alexander.

1269
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:41,280
But Alexander's decision was final, and he
said that they could all go home if they wished;

1270
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,780
Persians would take their place in his army.

1271
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:47,730
Immediately the Macedonians changed their
minds.

1272
01:36:47,730 --> 01:36:50,340
They asked Alexander to forgive them.

1273
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:54,820
They wanted him to send the old soldiers home,
but allow the rest of them to stay.

1274
01:36:54,820 --> 01:37:01,659
The problem was solved, and Alexander organized
a great dinner to celebrate the friendly relationship

1275
01:37:01,659 --> 01:37:05,510
between Macedonians and Persians.

1276
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:09,790
Alexander and his friends spent the next few
months relaxing and being entertained by theatre

1277
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:12,909
performances and sports competitions.

1278
01:37:12,909 --> 01:37:18,060
But Hephaistion caught a fever, became ill
and died.

1279
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:22,170
His death was a terrible shock to his lifelong
friend and king.

1280
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:26,469
For many weeks he was unable to think about
anything else.

1281
01:37:26,469 --> 01:37:30,710
Slowly Alexander returned to his usual business.

1282
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:36,580
He planned to send ships and a land army around
the coast of Arabia from Persia to Egypt.

1283
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:41,000
Other ships were going to check if the Caspian
Sea was part of a northern ocean or joined

1284
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:46,540
the Black Sea; although its southern coast
was part of the empire, no one seemed to know

1285
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:50,390
at that time that the Caspian Sea was actually
a lake.

1286
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:55,730
But in Babylon, Alexander suddenly became
ill.

1287
01:37:55,730 --> 01:38:00,330
Possibly he had been poisoned by his officers;
probably he had caught a disease carried by

1288
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:04,159
insects while he was travelling on Babylon's
waterways.

1289
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:08,330
He had a high fever, and after a week he could
not talk.

1290
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:14,670
On the tenth day, his court and army were
given the unthinkable news: Alexander the

1291
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:20,930
Great was dead.

1292
01:38:20,930 --> 01:38:22,409
CHAPTER TEN

1293
01:38:22,409 --> 01:38:25,369
After Alexander

1294
01:38:25,369 --> 01:38:30,300
Although Alexander's achievements had spread
Greek customs far into Asia, the Greeks in

1295
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:35,300
Europe were pleased about his death and decided
to fight for their independence.

1296
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:37,449
To them, he was still a foreigner.

1297
01:38:37,449 --> 01:38:42,940
But the Persians, who had lost an empire and
hundreds of thousands of men because of Alexander,

1298
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:46,660
were very upset when they heard that he had
died.

1299
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:51,679
King Darius's mother, who had become Alexander's
prisoner after the Battle of Issus, stopped

1300
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:58,110
eating when she heard the news, and was dead
herself five days later.

1301
01:38:58,110 --> 01:39:02,420
Alexander had become the Persians' Great King,
whose rule followed the traditions of the

1302
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:03,830
past.

1303
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:06,580
He had been their friend as well as their
conqueror.

1304
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:12,130
And, rightly, they feared a future without
him.

1305
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:16,610
Alexander died with no close male relative
except his brother Arrhidaeus, who had learning

1306
01:39:16,610 --> 01:39:17,650
difficulties.

1307
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:24,330
But Roxane, Alexander's first wife, was soon
going to have a baby.

1308
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:31,330
Alexander's friends decided to make the unborn
child the next king, if the baby was a boy.

1309
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:35,700
Alexander's friend Perdiccas, who had been
his second-in-command after the death of Hephaistion

1310
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:40,369
and had royal blood himself, would rule until
the baby grew up.

1311
01:39:40,369 --> 01:39:46,380
But the common soldiers wanted Arrhidaeus
as their king, as he was fully Macedonian

1312
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:50,590
and Roxane's baby had Asian blood.

1313
01:39:50,590 --> 01:39:54,610
Less than a week after Alexander's death,
fighting began.

1314
01:39:54,610 --> 01:39:59,050
It was only stopped when Perdiccas ordered
the death of thirty of the soldiers leaders

1315
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:00,760
and they were thrown to the elephants.

1316
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:08,200
It was agreed that rule would be shared between
Roxane's baby and Arrhidaeus.

1317
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:13,170
There were many years of confusion in the
empire that Alexander had built.

1318
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:17,250
The story of Alexander's dead body is typical
of the times.

1319
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:23,540
It was believed that the body's final resting
place would bring good luck to the local people.

1320
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:28,560
Perdiccas ordered his men to take it from
Babylon to Macedonia in a box of gold.

1321
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:33,251
But Ptolemy, who had been a close friend of
Alexander and had recently made himself king

1322
01:40:33,251 --> 01:40:39,060
of an independent Egypt, took the body in
secret to Egyptian Alexandria, where it stayed

1323
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:42,510
for hundreds of years.

1324
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:47,390
During the years after Alexander's death,
Roxane poisoned Alexander's other wives to

1325
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:53,040
protect the power of her baby son, also called
Alexander.

1326
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:58,390
Perdiccas ruled for a short time, until he
was murdered by his bodyguards.

1327
01:40:58,390 --> 01:41:02,719
Alexander's most loyal commanders all wanted
power for themselves, and they were willing

1328
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:05,429
to murder people to get it.

1329
01:41:05,429 --> 01:41:10,980
Antipater was the general who had controlled
the Macedonian army in Europe while Alexander

1330
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:12,889
was in Asia.

1331
01:41:12,889 --> 01:41:20,060
When Antipater died of old age, his son Cassander
took control of Macedonia.

1332
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:24,619
Alexander's mother, Olympias, was officially
in charge of Macedonia and tried to protect

1333
01:41:24,619 --> 01:41:26,410
her power.

1334
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:31,400
She murdered King Arrhidaeus, her husband's
son and Alexander's half-brother, and defended

1335
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:34,550
herself in the Macedonian town of Pydna.

1336
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:38,730
But Cassander put the town under siege.

1337
01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:44,119
After nine months she had no food, and she
died proudly.

1338
01:41:44,119 --> 01:41:49,270
Cassander then killed Roxane and her son,
who were visiting Greece, and made himself

1339
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:51,800
King of Macedonia.

1340
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:57,730
The Macedonians soon sold the lands that Alexander
had conquered in India; they received 500

1341
01:41:57,730 --> 01:41:59,830
elephants for them.

1342
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:05,429
Many years later, these lands were reconquered
by the Greek-speaking kings of Bactria, whose

1343
01:42:05,429 --> 01:42:11,000
family had been started by one of Alexander's
Macedonian governors.

1344
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:16,449
After years of fighting, two of Alexander's
commanders controlled most of his empire.

1345
01:42:16,449 --> 01:42:22,590
Ptolemy was King of Egypt and Seleucus king
of the Asian empire.

1346
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:27,159
The families of both men stayed in power until
their lands were conquered by the Romans in

1347
01:42:27,159 --> 01:42:30,450
the first century BC.

1348
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:35,090
All over Alexander's empire, Greek-style cities
had been built.

1349
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:39,599
Their populations were mostly European, and
became perhaps more Greek in their habits

1350
01:42:39,599 --> 01:42:41,780
as the years passed.

1351
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:46,820
In some areas, they preferred to marry their
sister, niece or granddaughter than to join

1352
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:50,159
their family with the foreigners that surrounded
them.

1353
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:56,220
Each city had a gymnasium, and held sporting
competitions and theatre performances.

1354
01:42:56,220 --> 01:43:01,050
In Afghanistan, buildings and works of art
have been discovered which copied exactly

1355
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:03,619
the artistic styles of Greece.

1356
01:43:03,619 --> 01:43:08,980
The works of Homer, Plato and Aristotle were
read and enjoyed in India and even across

1357
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:11,830
the sea in Sri Lanka.

1358
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:16,810
The greatest of Alexander's new cities was
Alexandria, the capital of Egypt under the

1359
01:43:16,810 --> 01:43:18,450
Ptolemaic kings.

1360
01:43:18,450 --> 01:43:24,750
While many parts of Alexander's empire suffered
from continued fighting, Egypt lived in peace

1361
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:27,409
and grew in power.

1362
01:43:27,409 --> 01:43:34,290
Its economy was very successful; from Alexandria,
ships took paper, medicines, jewellery and

1363
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:37,780
art all over the known world.

1364
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:43,040
The Ptolemaic kings mixed Greek customs with
Egyptian traditions, and built temples to

1365
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:46,090
both Greek and Egyptian gods.

1366
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:52,100
They were very interested in literature, philosophy
and science, and invited the most famous writers

1367
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,330
of their age to live in Alexandria.

1368
01:43:54,330 --> 01:44:00,900
Out of this collection of great men grew a
great idea: a library that brought together

1369
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:06,099
all Greek knowledge and included every book
that had ever been written.

1370
01:44:06,099 --> 01:44:12,790
At its largest, this library held 50,000 books
- not a lot compared to the great modern libraries,

1371
01:44:12,790 --> 01:44:17,460
but in a world before printing machines this
was an extraordinary number.

1372
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:22,949
Among these books was a growing collection
of histories of Alexander's life.

1373
01:44:22,949 --> 01:44:27,630
Some of them were interested in the facts;
others told romantic stories that were completely

1374
01:44:27,630 --> 01:44:29,199
untrue.

1375
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:33,659
They said that he and his warhorse Bucephalas
each had two horns on their heads.

1376
01:44:33,659 --> 01:44:41,610
They told of strange flying machines, a Valley
of Diamonds, and the secret of immortality.

1377
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:47,389
Alexander's legend was told from Iceland to
China; in death he travelled far beyond the

1378
01:44:47,389 --> 01:44:51,830
borders of his own empire.

1379
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:56,450
Over the years, interest in Alexander has
been shown in many different ways.

1380
01:44:56,450 --> 01:45:01,270
He appears in the Book of Daniel, which was
written in Hebrew in the second century BC

1381
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:04,800
and now forms part of the Christian Bible.

1382
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:09,110
He was the hero of Julius Caesar, Rome's greatest
general.

1383
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:14,370
The Italian artist Michelangelo created a
square in Rome to look like Alexander's famous

1384
01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:15,370
shield.

1385
01:45:15,370 --> 01:45:21,310
The French ruler Napoleon used to read about
Alexander in bed every night.

1386
01:45:21,310 --> 01:45:27,580
In the early 1900s, tribal kings in Afghanistan
still went into battle carrying a red flag

1387
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:32,020
which, according to their legends, had belonged
to Alexander.

1388
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:40,140
And in 2004, Alexander's extraordinary story
was brought to life in a $155 million Hollywood

1389
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:41,349
film.

1390
01:45:41,349 --> 01:45:48,730
It starred Colin Farrell as Alexander and
was watched in cinemas all around the world.

1391
01:45:48,730 --> 01:45:52,930
Alexander the Great may be more famous in
the twenty-first century than he ever was.
