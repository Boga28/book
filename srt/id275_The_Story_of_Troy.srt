The Story of Troy

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,760
by David Malue

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,720
CHAPTER ONE

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,000
Legends and Heroes

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:16,202
About 2,700 years ago, when Greece was one of the greatest civilizations in the world, the Greek writer Homer wrote two
poems: The Iliad and The Odyssey.

6
00:00:16,362 --> 00:00:23,042
Both of these are very long, and they tell us about people
who fought in a war between Greece and Troy.

7
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:26,003
This war was already history when Homer wrote about it.

8
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:33,843
The material he used was from traditional stories that had been handed down from parents to children over more than 500
years.

9
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:36,884
How much truth there was in them, we simply do not know.

10
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:43,484
Troy was a large, walled city in what is now Turkey,
although this was a long time before the Turks came to live
here.

11
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:47,165
The people who lived on the western side of Turkey then were
Greeks.

12
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:51,605
So, we can talk of Greeks and Trojans, but this is simply
convenient.

13
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:58,006
The people on both sides spoke and wrote the same language,
prayed to the same gods, and shared the same culture.

14
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:04,046
The men who attacked Troy came from Sparta and a number of
other cities and areas that were allied to it.

15
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:07,126
Troy also had its allies among nearby states.

16
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:11,767
Homer tells how the war went on for ten years with neither
side able to win.

17
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:18,448
Then, the invaders thought of the clever plan of using a
huge wooden horse to get some men inside the city.

18
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:21,528
It is the wooden horse that people think about when Troy is
mentioned.

19
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:25,128
We do not know if it really was built, but the idea is still
alive.

20
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:29,609
The story of Troy has even given us an idiom in English.

21
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:34,249
A "Trojan horse" can be used to mean a way of defeating your
opponents by first offering them a gift.

22
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:36,889
The ancient Greeks believed in many gods.

23
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:40,130
They built temples for the gods and made offerings to them
of fruit.

24
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:48,090
When they felt it was necessary, they might sacrifice an
animal, or even a person.

25
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,891
In the poems, the most important gods help to start the war
and interfere in the plan for the wooden horse.

26
00:01:53,891 --> 00:02:00,332
The gods in this story include Zeus, who was king over all; his queen, Hera; and two of his daughters, Aphrodite and
Athena.

27
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:01,212
They are responsible for starting the war.

28
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:02,092
They watch it closely from their home on Mount Olympus.

29
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:04,892
They also use their powers to protect their favourite humans
and destroy their enemies.

30
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:05,172
CHAPTER TWO

31
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:06,012
The Golden Apple

32
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:10,253
The problem with Eris is that she causes trouble everywhere
she goes.

33
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:12,173
Well, that's her job.

34
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:16,253
She's the goddess of arguments and disagreements, and
somebody has to do it.

35
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:20,014
But she's not the sort of person you might want at a
wedding.

36
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:26,694
So, when Peleus and Thetis got married on Mount Olympus,
every god and goddess was there except Eris.

37
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:27,574
Hera left her off the list.

38
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:30,375
Hera's the queen of the gods so the decision was hers, and,
as we'll see, it caused a whole lot of trouble.

39
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,095
Everybody was having a great time, eating the best food and
drinking nectar from golden cups.

40
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:34,615
Then Eris turned up.

41
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:43,616
She just stood there, glaring at everyone, then she pulled something out of her tunic, said, "My present for you!" and
threw it among the guests.

42
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:49,136
It was a golden apple - maybe not the most normal wedding
present - but Eris knew what she was doing.

43
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:57,577
The god who caught the apple looked at it closely, then said, "There is something written here on the apple. It
says, Tor the most beautiful.'"

44
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,097
That started it, of course.

45
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,617
Hera was first to speak.

46
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:02,618
"I am queen of the gods!" she said.

47
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:13,059
"I must be the most beautiful. The apple is mine." This was not the best argument I've ever heard, but it might have
been the end of it, except that Athena got involved.

48
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:18,739
"No, Hera, you are wrong. I am the goddess of wisdom. The
apple belongs to me."

49
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:24,580
Myself, I couldn't see any connection between wisdom and
beauty, unless she meant some sort of inner beauty.

50
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,900
More importantly, you might have expected a goddess of
wisdom to stay out of a silly disagreement like that.

51
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,621
However, Athena was also the goddess of warfare, so maybe
she felt she had to speak up.

52
00:03:36,621 --> 00:03:43,182
Then, while Hera stared at her, it became a three-cornered
fight because Aphrodite stepped in.

53
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:47,822
"I am the goddess of love and beauty," she said in that soft
voice she always used.

54
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,022
"The apple is mine."

55
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:58,063
Personally, I think Aphrodite had a point, and I would have given it to her, but neither of the other two were willing
to give way.

56
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:03,264
The air got fairly heavy with insults after that, and there
was a feeling that the party was over.

57
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:08,064
The argument went on for some time, and you could see that
the other gods were getting tired of it.

58
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,384
In the end, Zeus had to intervene.

59
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:20,385
He was king of the gods, and I suppose he could have settled
it there and then, but Hera was his wife - and, what's more, Athena and Aphrodite were his daughters!

60
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,946
You could see that any decision he made would cause serious
trouble in the family.

61
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:30,706
So he told them to go and see a shepherd called Paris, who
lived on Mount Ida near the city of Troy.

62
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:33,306
Now, that's a good distance across the sea.

63
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:40,467
It was far enough away to guarantee a bit of peace and quiet
for the rest of us - you could see his thinking.

64
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:44,268
Zeus said that Paris was famous for his good judgement.

65
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:50,268
You might wonder why somebody with that kind of reputation
was working as a shepherd, but we'll get to that later.

66
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:58,069
So off the three of them went - they just disappeared, like gods and goddesses do - and the rest of us got back to the
food and the nectar.

67
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:07,350
A few seconds later, on Mount Ida, Paris looked up from his sheep and there they were, three goddesses, shining with
light and scaring him half to death.

68
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,710
Hera showed him the apple and told him the problem.

69
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,510
She made it clear that he had to choose.

70
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:19,751
Then she said if he chose her, she would give him as much power on earth as Zeus had in heaven - which was a pretty
fair offer.

71
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:22,191
Then, Athena made him another offer.

72
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:27,112
She said she would make him the wisest man in the world, and
the winner of every battle.

73
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:32,072
Then, Aphrodite stepped forward, and you could see the
effect on Paris.

74
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:35,792
She was absolutely beautiful, and she knew how to dress as
well.

75
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:43,713
"Paris," she said, "if you give me the apple, you shall have
Helen, a daughter of Zeus. She is as beautiful as I am."

76
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:46,914
He just grabbed the apple from the grass and handed it to
her.

77
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,754
It was the right choice of course.

78
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:51,114
Aphrodite was the most beautiful.

79
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:53,474
But he made it for all the wrong reasons.

80
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:56,154
So, the goddesses vanished.

81
00:05:56,154 --> 00:06:00,915
Aphrodite was probably pleased with the apple, but the other
two hated Paris like poison.

82
00:06:00,915 --> 00:06:01,635
CHAPTER THREE

83
00:06:01,635 --> 00:06:03,075
Paris and Helen

84
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:05,675
The king of Troy at the time was called Priam.

85
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:10,596
Not long after the business with the golden apple, he
decided to hold a sports contest.

86
00:06:10,596 --> 00:06:15,676
This was to be in memory of a son of his who had died a few
years before.

87
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:20,837
He sent his servants to Mount Ida to capture a bull for the
first prize.

88
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:29,398
You might well ask what a valuable animal like that was doing just walking around a mountain on its own, but things
were different in those days.

89
00:06:29,398 --> 00:06:33,838
Later, the servants were having a break and chatting, and
Paris appeared.

90
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:35,958
He had come down to see what was happening.

91
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:40,039
He asked about the bull, and they told him what it was for.

92
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:42,719
Now, Paris was actually quite good at sport.

93
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:47,119
He liked the idea of joining in, so he packed his things and
went down to Troy.

94
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:49,480
Did I say Paris was quite good at sport?

95
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,880
The man was top-class.

96
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,240
He won the pentathlon without any difficulty at all.

97
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:01,801
This involved two throwing events, followed by jumping,
wrestling, and running, and he came an easy first in every
one.

98
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:07,561
Even the royal princes couldn't keep up with him - and just
think of the amount of specialist coaching they'd had.

99
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:11,922
Paris had trained himself up to this standard in odd moments
between watching his sheep.

100
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:17,202
It caused a fair amount of jealousy because the princes
weren't used to being beaten as easily as this.

101
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:26,563
Hector, the eldest one, drew his sword and said he was going
to kill Paris there and then.

102
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:29,603
Not very sporting, but Hector had a vicious temper.

103
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:37,244
And, for a moment, it looked like the end for the shepherd, but then an old man pushed through the crowd and threw
himself at King Priam's feet.

104
00:07:37,244 --> 00:07:38,884
"My lord!" he said.

105
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:44,645
"This is no ordinary shepherd. This is your lost son - the
one in whose memory you are holding these games."

106
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:48,165
Well, this came as quite a shock to Priam, and to the rest
of us.

107
00:07:48,165 --> 00:08:05,167
The old man went on, "Remember when your son was born? Your wife dreamt that he would cause the destruction of Troy. I
am the servant you ordered to leave the baby on Mount Ida to die. But I took pity on the child. I looked after him and watched him grow into a fine young man."

108
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:06,647
Priam was so pleased.

109
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:10,087
I think he'd regretted sending the boy away to die.

110
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:13,488
He told the crowd that Paris was back, as a prince of Troy.

111
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:16,608
They all cheered, though Hector didn't look too pleased.

112
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:23,049
That night, Paris woke suddenly to find Aphrodite standing
there, with the moonlight all around her.

113
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:32,690
She whispered to him, "Helen is the queen of Sparta. Go there and find her, Paris. Remember, I will always look
after you, for you gave the golden apple to me."

114
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,250
Paris was pleased, even though Helen was another man's wife
and lived quite a distance away.

115
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,370
Next morning, he went to King Priam and asked for a ship.

116
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,451
This caused a bit of a problem.

117
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:49,051
Priam was pleased to have his son back, and was happy to
give him anything he asked for.

118
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:54,772
However, naturally he wanted to know what the ship was for,
and Paris couldn't tell him.

119
00:08:54,772 --> 00:09:04,493
He couldn't just say "I'm going to sail across to Sparta and try to steal the king's wife." So he made up some story
about wanting to see something of the world after spending so many years on Mount Ida.

120
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:10,373
Paris got a silver statue of Aphrodite and tied it to the
front of the ship, to show who was looking after him.

121
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:17,374
The next day, he set sail through the Aegean, round the
southern point of mainland Greece, and into the bay near
Sparta.

122
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:27,375
He arrived at the court of King Menelaus in some style, because King Priam had given him many attendants and
servants, and also presents for the Spartan royal family.

123
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,415
And when he saw Helen, he fell in love with her.

124
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:32,135
Both the king and queen were very welcoming.

125
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:36,416
The slaves took him away for a bath and dressed him in a
purple robe.

126
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:40,936
Then they brought him to the dining room where Menelaus and
Helen were waiting in front of a feast.

127
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:42,816
It was all wasted on Paris.

128
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:46,577
He just picked at his food, and could hardly take his eyes
off Helen.

129
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:48,417
He didn't have a chance.

130
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:52,257
Aphrodite had set the whole thing up, and he more or less
had to fall in love with her.

131
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:56,898
It never crossed his mind that stealing another man's wife
might cause trouble.

132
00:09:56,898 --> 00:10:01,498
As dinner drew to a close, Paris spilled his wine on the
table.

133
00:10:01,498 --> 00:10:03,218
He apologized, of course.

134
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:08,539
Menelaus just waved a hand to show it didn't matter, and
went back to the conversation he was having.

135
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:14,819
Then, while his eyes were turned away, Paris wrote the words
"I love you" in the wine for only Helen to see.

136
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:18,940
The feast came to an end, and one by one, the guests left.

137
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,580
Even Menelaus went off to bed, leaving just Paris and his
wife talking together.

138
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,621
He might have had his suspicions, but they were only
talking, after all.

139
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:31,581
By this point, Helen was probably half in love with Paris.

140
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:33,581
Then Aphrodite lent a hand.

141
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:40,102
She sent down some magic, and soon Helen was gazing into his
eyes like he was the only man in the world.

142
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:45,102
He held out his hand, she took it, and suddenly they were
running out of the silent palace.

143
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:49,143
Before any of the Spartans noticed, they were well on the
way back to his ship.

144
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:51,063
There were some who noticed, of course.

145
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:52,623
Hera, for one.

146
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:57,544
She was sitting up on Olympus, watching everything closely
in the way that gods and goddesses can do.

147
00:10:57,544 --> 00:11:00,864
She saw the ship leave and waited till they were far out to
sea.

148
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:03,984
Then, she sent down storm after storm to wreck it.

149
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:06,544
She still hated Paris for not giving her the apple.

150
00:11:06,544 --> 00:11:08,345
But he had Aphrodite looking after him.

151
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:14,105
She saved his life that night, and all the nights to follow,
and brought him safely back to Troy.

152
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:19,786
Everybody turned out to greet him, and, if they had any
doubts about the love-match, they didn't show it.

153
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:23,946
Well, everybody except Cassandra.

154
00:11:23,946 --> 00:11:27,387
She was Priam's daughter, and she was a prophet.

155
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:32,067
She ran about, tearing her hair, and shouting that Helen
would bring about the end of Troy.

156
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,467
Nobody believed her.

157
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:36,347
She was always shouting about some disaster or other.

158
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:43,468
Meanwhile, up in her new apartment, Helen was beginning to recover from the magic, and to wonder just exactly what she
had done.

159
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:46,788
On the night that Helen left, Menelaus had a bad dream.

160
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:49,749
He dreamt that Paris was going to run away with Helen.

161
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:54,869
It started to come true when he woke up and noticed that
he'd been sleeping alone.

162
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:59,950
He got up and moved through the palace, searching room after
room, and he couldn't find her anywhere.

163
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,470
All the time, he was getting more and more angry.

164
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,670
Then, somebody told him that Paris had run away with Helen,
and he lost control completely.

165
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:14,351
He took Paris' purple robe and tore it in two, and he shouted some really horrible things about what he'd do when
he caught him.

166
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,991
Then, he looked up and shouted to the sky.

167
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:22,472
"I call on you gods to help me get revenge on Paris!"

168
00:12:22,472 --> 00:12:29,793
When Menelaus married Helen, all the Greek leaders promised that they would avenge any insult to her, so now he called
in the debt.

169
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:32,033
However, a few of them were reluctant.

170
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:38,033
Odysseus was happily married, and had a son, and when the
call came he pretended to be mad.

171
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:41,674
He couldn't keep it up for long though, and in the end, he
had to agree.

172
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:44,394
Once he was in, Achilles followed.

173
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:48,274
They needed Achilles - he was the greatest warrior in
Greece.

174
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:53,355
Second to him was Ajax, a huge man, though a little slow in
the head.

175
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:57,115
Odysseus was quite useful as well, and brighter than the
other two.

176
00:12:57,115 --> 00:13:01,236
As commander, they chose Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae.

177
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:05,156
He was Menelaus's brother, and he was married to Helen's
sister.

178
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:11,637
It took two years to get the fleet together and in the end,
there were a thousand ships.

179
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:13,397
They set sail for Troy.

180
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:18,957
The sun god Apollo blew a gentle wind to help the ships, and
told dolphins to follow them.

181
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:19,837
CHAPTER FOUR

182
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:20,797
The War Begins

183
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:28,998
The ships sailed for nearly three weeks, through black storms one minute and blue skies the next, because the gods
were arguing.

184
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:33,239
Zeus, who was favouring Aphrodite, sent down thunder and
lightning.

185
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:39,999
Then, Apollo blew the storm clouds away and calmed the
winds, which made Hera and Athena happy.

186
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:42,680
At last, the fleet landed on the shore near Troy.

187
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,760
The Greeks got out of their ships, and were immediately
attacked by the Trojans, led by Hector.

188
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,160
The first man to die was a Greek called Protesilaus.

189
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,881
Back in Greece, a prophet had said that victory would go to
the side who first lost a man.

190
00:13:56,881 --> 00:14:00,241
Protesilaus had believed this, and felt that he had to be
the one.

191
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:05,442
His was the first ship to hit the beach, he was the first
man off it, and he went straight for Hector.

192
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:11,402
Well, not many men could hope to take on Hector and live,
and Protesilaus didn't last long.

193
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:13,803
But Achilles was in good form that day.

194
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:16,283
There was a circle of death all around him.

195
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:28,924
Ajax killed many too, in his slow and deliberate way, and Odysseus moved around, fighting when he had to, but using
his brains to get the Greek army formed up properly.

196
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:34,725
Then they moved forward and, before Hector could do anything
to stop them, the Trojan army broke.

197
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:37,325
They ran back to the city and shut the gates.

198
00:14:37,365 --> 00:14:47,006
While the rest of the Greek army unloaded the ships, and settled down to a siege, Menelaus and Odysseus went to see
Priam to ask for Helen's return.

199
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:52,326
However, neither Priam nor the people of Troy were in the
mood to talk peace.

200
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:58,567
To make matters worse, as the two Greeks were walking back
towards the city gate, the crowd turned on them.

201
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,727
They were lucky to escape with their lives.

202
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:06,568
When the rest of the Greeks saw Menelaus and Odysseus chased
out of the city, they were really angry.

203
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:08,928
The battle had now become a war.

204
00:15:08,968 --> 00:15:16,249
On the plain outside the city, and along the shore where
their ships were tied up, the Greeks put up their tents.

205
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:20,369
That night, the shore was covered with the lights from
hundreds of campfires.

206
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:24,449
The Greeks made a number of attacks on the walls, but
without success.

207
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:29,050
After a while, they gave up and settled down for a long
siege.

208
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,610
They placed their soldiers all round the city, so that
nobody could get in with food.

209
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:39,891
But Priam had seen this coming, and had made sure that Troy
had plenty of food.

210
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:45,731
And so it went on for years, with the Greeks outside, and
the Trojans inside.

211
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:50,852
Sometimes, the Trojans would come out and fight, and men
would die, but very little changed.

212
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:55,012
In the tenth year, there was an argument between Agamemnon
and Achilles.

213
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:57,653
Agamemnon had taken a girl as a hostage.

214
00:15:57,653 --> 00:16:01,573
When her father produced the money, he wouldn't give her up.

215
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:06,093
Now, the girl's mother was a prophet of Apollo, and Apollo
was not pleased.

216
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:08,974
He sent down nine days of illness on the Greeks.

217
00:16:08,974 --> 00:16:13,294
Achilles spoke to Agamemnon, and said that the girl should
be set free.

218
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:20,135
Things got very heated and the result was that Agamemnon
took a slave girl from Achilles as a punishment.

219
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:23,375
Achilles walked off the field and went back to his tent.

220
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,695
He said he would never fight for the Greeks again.

221
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:32,016
With Achilles in his tent, it was up to Odysseus to put some
spirit back into the Greeks.

222
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:33,456
He gathered them around him.

223
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:38,217
"Men," he said, "we've been here ten years, and I want to go
home as much as you do.

224
00:16:38,217 --> 00:16:49,698
Achilles has left us, and I'm sorry about that. But we are a strong army, and we can fight on. We can still win, we can
take Troy and take back Helen. Are you with me?"

225
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:54,018
Of course, he knew they were or he'd never have asked the
question.

226
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:58,499
He probably said more than I've repeated here, but these
were the main points.

227
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:00,699
He was a good speaker and he talked them round.

228
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:03,899
The army formed up and marched across the plain towards
Troy.

229
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:09,820
When the Trojans saw that Achilles wasn't with them, they
showed just how much respect they had for him - they came
out.

230
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,300
Hector appeared first with the chariots, and a great show
they made.

231
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:21,261
They wheeled and circled, throwing up huge clouds of dust,
and probably frightening the Greeks, as they were meant to.

232
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:24,701
Then came the horsemen and the foot soldiers, group after
group.

233
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:29,142
These were men from Troy, but also from other cities nearby.

234
00:17:29,142 --> 00:17:30,182
CHAPTER FIVE

235
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,222
A Duel for Peace

236
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:34,582
When the armies had lined up, Hector led the Trojans
forward.

237
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:37,622
They shouted battle-cries and made a lot of noise.

238
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:43,703
The Greeks came on in silence, and the dust from thousands
of feet spread across the plain.

239
00:17:43,703 --> 00:17:50,704
When they were close to each other, Paris came out ahead of the Trojan lines and waved the spear as a challenge to the
Greeks.

240
00:17:50,784 --> 00:17:55,104
Menelaus saw him, jumped down from his chariot, and walked
forward.

241
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:57,584
And that was when Paris's courage left him.

242
00:17:57,584 --> 00:18:02,625
This was the man whose wife he had stolen, the one man he
never wanted to see again.

243
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,785
He stepped back, and kept going back until he was

244
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,025
Hector was angry.

245
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:07,945
"Paris," he said,

246
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:17,866
"what will the Greeks say when they see that our champion is just a handsome man with no courage? You're the one who
started all this. Can't you face Menelaus?"

247
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,466
This seemed to steady Paris.

248
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,987
You could see him pull his head up.

249
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:30,467
Then he said, "Very well, Hector, if you want me to fight Menelaus, tell everybody to sit down. Let the winner have
Helen and let there be peace."

250
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:36,428
Hector was happy to hear this, and he got the Trojans to sit
down, and Agamemnon told the Greeks to do the same.

251
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:42,669
Then Hector told the Greeks what Paris had said, and
Menelaus made it clear that he agreed.

252
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:49,429
In the small space between the two front lines, Paris and Menelaus faced each other, and you could see that both of
them were angry.

253
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,869
Paris made the first move.

254
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:55,110
He threw his spear at Menelaus, but it slid off his shield.

255
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,670
Then, Menelaus stepped forward, sent up a prayer to Zeus,
and threw his spear.

256
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,871
It went right through Paris' shield and armour, but he
turned away, and it just tore a hole in his shirt.

257
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:11,431
Menelaus drew his sword, and ran at him.

258
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:16,832
The first swing caught the front part of his helmet, but the
sword broke into three or four pieces in his hand.

259
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:26,993
He said something nasty to Zeus - you could hear it loud and clear - then he caught Paris by the horsehair on the top of
his helmet and started to drag him towards the Greek lines.

260
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:33,914
The strap on Paris' helmet was choking him, and he might
have died then if Aphrodite had not come down and broken it.

261
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:36,714
Menelaus was left with the helmet in his hand.

262
00:19:36,714 --> 00:19:43,835
He picked up a spear and was about to finish Paris off when
Aphrodite stepped in again.

263
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,955
She hid Paris in a cloud of mist and carried him away.

264
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:51,235
So Menelaus was the winner, and there was peace, at least
for a while.

265
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:56,076
On Mount Olympus, the gods were sitting together drinking
nectar and looking down on Troy.

266
00:19:56,076 --> 00:20:16,678
Zeus said, "Menelaus has two good friends among the goddesses - Hera and Athena. But they can only sit and
watch, while Aphrodite keeps Paris out of danger. Look how she just rescued him! Are you all happy for Menelaus to take Helen back, and for there to be peace?" Athena glared at her father, but said nothing, but Hera spoke up.

267
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:20,038
"Is all my hard work to go for nothing?" she asked.

268
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:25,359
"You can do what you like, but we will not be happy with
peace." This made Zeus angry.

269
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:35,200
"What harm have Priam and his sons done you," he said, "that makes you so keen to destroy their city?" Then, with an
effort, he got himself under control.

270
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,160
"Very well, I have nothing against Troy, but it isn't worth
a fight between us."

271
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,680
"Thank you," Hera said.

272
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,121
"Now, will you send Athena to make the Trojans break the
peace?"

273
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:51,681
"Athena," Zeus said, with a sigh, "go and do what your
mother wants."

274
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:53,481
Athena was delighted, of course.

275
00:20:53,521 --> 00:21:03,722
She turned herself into a Trojan soldier and went to see
Pandarus, one of the Trojan chiefs.

276
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:17,044
He thought he was talking to a friend of his, and had no idea it was Athena who said to him: "You are good with a bow
and arrow. If you could kill Menelaus all the Trojans would thank you, and Paris would give you a great reward."

277
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:23,124
Now, Pandarus was a bit of a fool, and he believed what he
heard.

278
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:26,804
He put an arrow to his bow and sent it flying towards
Menelaus.

279
00:21:26,804 --> 00:21:28,805
But then Aphrodite stepped in.

280
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:33,325
She turned the arrow in its flight, so that it hit the lower
part of his breastplate.

281
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:38,006
It went through this and hit the belt buckle underneath.

282
00:21:38,486 --> 00:21:42,366
That was enough to stop it, but it still cut him, and the
blood ran down his legs.

283
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:45,206
Agamemnon looked at him, and was afraid.

284
00:21:45,206 --> 00:21:52,367
So was Menelaus, until he saw that most of the arrow-head
was still outside his armor.

285
00:21:52,367 --> 00:22:04,488
Then they held hands, and Agamemnon said, "My brother, I would never have forgiven you if this peace had led to your
death. But the Trojans have broken a promise made before the gods, and they will pay for it."

286
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:05,248
CHAPTER SIX

287
00:22:05,848 --> 00:22:07,568
Hector, Trojan Hero

288
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:13,289
That night in Troy, Hector stood outside the royal palace,
with his soldiers all around him.

289
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:16,129
They were angry, and more than a little afraid.

290
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:20,450
"You must show us how we can force the Greeks back. Show us
how to fight them."

291
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,290
Hector didn't answer, but he took time to look at them.

292
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,650
Then he looked up at the stars, turned and walked up the
steps to the palace.

293
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:32,371
Once inside, he threw off his red cloak and started to put
on his armor.

294
00:22:32,371 --> 00:22:37,371
His wife Andromache watched him, and there was fear in her
dark eyes.

295
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:39,572
"What are you going to do?" she said.

296
00:22:39,572 --> 00:22:41,612
He shook his head, but didn't answer.

297
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,692
He knelt down on the stone floor to kiss his son.

298
00:22:45,092 --> 00:22:46,572
The baby burst into tears.

299
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:48,692
Hector laughed, and took off his helmet.

300
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:52,733
This had two horns and a great plume of horsehair.

301
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:55,013
It was enough to frighten any child.

302
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:58,053
He picked up his son, and the baby started to laugh.

303
00:22:58,453 --> 00:23:02,374
"Little one," Hector said, "one day you will be a Trojan
hero."

304
00:23:02,374 --> 00:23:06,294
He turned to his wife "The gods have given me no choice," he
said.

305
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:11,615
"I must fight to the death." Hector called his men together
and told them what he had in mind.

306
00:23:11,615 --> 00:23:13,415
When it came, the attack was sudden.

307
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:23,096
The Greeks had left a line of men around the city, but the greatest part of their army was near the ships, behind a
defensive line made of sharpened wooden posts.

308
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,656
It was quite late at night by now, and most of them were
sleeping.

309
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:34,617
Others just sat around the fires, drinking wine and talking,
and suddenly the Trojans were on them.

310
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:40,537
The first thing they heard was the shouts as a tight group
of Hector's men burst through the men near the walls.

311
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:50,138
There were Trojans with axes at the front, breaking down the wood and smashing holes in the line so that Hector and his
best fighters could get through.

312
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:53,499
Some of the Greeks tried to stand and fight, but they were
outnumbered.

313
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:56,459
They were pushed aside like water from the front of a ship.

314
00:23:56,499 --> 00:24:00,859
And it was ships that Hector had in his mind - the lines of
ships pulled up on the beach.

315
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:07,860
His soldiers broke through to the edge of the sea and spread
out in two lines, pushing back the Greeks.

316
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,501
This allowed men with torches to get to the ships and set
fire to them.

317
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:19,901
Ship after ship went up in flames, and sparks flew from one
ship to the other, setting more and more on fire.

318
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:24,582
Within minutes, half of the Greek army was trying to get the
rest of the ships off the beach.

319
00:24:24,582 --> 00:24:28,622
Later that night, when the fires were out, Patroclus went to
see Achilles.

320
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:32,182
Patroclus was his cousin, and his best friend.

321
00:24:32,182 --> 00:24:36,223
He was also one of the few people who could speak to him at
that time.

322
00:24:36,263 --> 00:24:37,543
They both sat down.

323
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:41,023
"You saw what the Greeks did tonight?" Patroclus said.

324
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:42,783
"I did," said Achilles.

325
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:44,944
"Won't you come back and help us now?"

326
00:24:44,944 --> 00:24:46,304
Achilles shook his head.

327
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:49,744
"No. Not till Agamemnon returns the slave girl."

328
00:24:49,744 --> 00:24:52,384
Patroclus picked up a piece of Achilles' armour.

329
00:24:52,544 --> 00:24:59,625
"I thought you might say that. And I had an idea. If you let me wear your armor, I might make the Greeks believe I am
you. That would frighten them."

330
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,865
Achilles thought for a moment.

331
00:25:00,905 --> 00:25:10,186
"You can borrow the armor if you like. But don't try to attack Troy on your own. That would make Apollo angry, and
he loves the Trojans."

332
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:15,107
The next morning, the Trojans were outside their walls and
moving forward.

333
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,267
The Greeks lined up and went to meet them.

334
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:20,707
Athena had disguised herself as a vulture.

335
00:25:20,707 --> 00:25:24,467
She sat and watched everything from a tall pine tree.

336
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:28,308
Apollo himself was on the walls of Troy, shining in the
sunlight.

337
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:36,309
The armies were close together, ready to meet, when Patroclus drove his chariot right down the middle of the
space between them.

338
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:40,389
He was wearing Achilles' armor, waving a spear, and I
shouting.

339
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:44,069
The whole Trojan army saw him and he did look just like
Achilles.

340
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:45,630
Then the Greeks ran forward.

341
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,590
Patroclus followed in his chariot, all the way back to the
walls.

342
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,830
It looked for a moment like he might try to capture the city
on his own.

343
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,711
That was too much for Apollo.

344
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:59,631
From his place high up on the walls, he sent down a ray of sunlight, which hit one of Patroclus' horses right in the
eye.

345
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:02,311
The horse threw up its front legs and slid to a halt.

346
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,992
The chariot rolled over and Patroclus was thrown to the
ground.

347
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:09,072
His helmet flew off and his spear broke into pieces.

348
00:26:09,112 --> 00:26:16,673
Hector ran up to Patroclus, who was trying to crawl away,
and he killed him with a single swing of his sword.

349
00:26:16,673 --> 00:26:25,473
As the army moved past him, throwing the Greeks back, Hector took Achilles' armor off the dead body of Patroclus and had
it carried back into the city.

350
00:26:25,473 --> 00:26:26,473
CHAPTER SEVEN

351
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:27,514
Death of the Heroes

352
00:26:27,514 --> 00:26:34,754
The Greeks moved back to their camp, and stood behind their
defensive line.

353
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:36,995
The Trojans could not break it this time.

354
00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:39,995
After a while, they stopped trying and went back to the
city.

355
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:48,196
A messenger came to tell Achilles that Hector had killed
Patroclus, and had taken Achilles' armor.

356
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:52,956
His shouts of anger and sadness could be heard all over the
Greek camp.

357
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:58,237
They could be heard in Troy itself, and far away in her sea
cave his mother Thetis heard them.

358
00:26:58,237 --> 00:27:01,877
As soon as she heard Achilles' shouts, she rushed to his
side.

359
00:27:01,877 --> 00:27:08,998
When she arrived, he asked for her help to avenge his
friend's death.

360
00:27:08,998 --> 00:27:10,678
He was worried about his armor.

361
00:27:10,678 --> 00:27:14,278
This was very special, and had been made by the blacksmith
of the gods.

362
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:20,239
It was so strong that no weapon could go through it, and now
Hector had taken it away.

363
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:26,759
That night on Mount Olympus, Thetis went to see the
blacksmith of the gods and asked him to make new armor for
Achilles.

364
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,880
He said that a full suit of armor would take some time, but
he would do what he could that night.

365
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,040
The next morning Thetis carried a new helmet and shield to
Achilles.

366
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,720
Achilles looked at them as if he had expected more.

367
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,161
Then Thetis spoke.

368
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:57,762
"My son," she said, "there is something I have never told you. When you were a baby, I dipped you in the River Styx.
Because of this, no weapon can harm you - so you don't really need armor. But when I dipped you in, I held you by the heel. If your heel is wounded, you may die."

369
00:27:57,762 --> 00:28:05,243
That day, as another battle swept across the plain, Achilles
joined in and fought his way through the Trojan army.

370
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,323
He left many dead men behind him.

371
00:28:07,363 --> 00:28:09,043
It was the real Achilles this time.

372
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,244
Nobody could be in any doubt.

373
00:28:10,244 --> 00:28:14,204
The living Trojans looked at the dead ones who surrounded
him, and began to move back.

374
00:28:14,204 --> 00:28:22,005
All the time, Achilles was shouting, "Hector! Hector! Where
are you?" Near the walls, they met face to face.

375
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:27,205
Hector had the city gate open behind him, and he could have
run inside, but he stood and fought.

376
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:34,886
He fought well, but no man could hope to win against one
whose mother was a god.

377
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:40,406
Achilles chose his moment, when Hector was tiring, and drove
his spear through his neck.

378
00:28:40,406 --> 00:28:45,527
Hector fell dead on the ground, and a great sigh went up
from the Trojans on the walls.

379
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:50,287
It was blown away by the cries of the delighted Greeks.

380
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:54,328
Achilles tore off Hector's armor and tied his body to the
back of his chariot.

381
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:59,288
Then, he drove round Troy three times, dragging the body of
Hector behind him.

382
00:28:59,288 --> 00:29:02,809
Priam and the rest of the Trojans watched in horror from the
city walls.

383
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:06,289
Achilles organized a great funeral for Patroclus.

384
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:13,090
His body was burnt on a huge pile of wood, and afterwards
there were sports contests with a lot of eating and
drinking.

385
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:22,170
But Achilles kept Hector's body tied to his chariot, and day
after day, he dragged it round the walls of Troy.

386
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:27,171
Priam sent a messenger to ask for the body to be returned,
but Achilles refused.

387
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:31,811
Many of the Greeks did not like what he was doing, but he
would listen to nobody.

388
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:40,892
Even the gods grew angry at his behavior, and Thetis came to
speak to him, but she could not get him to listen either.

389
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:45,533
The gods didn't like this at all, and began to think of a
way to punish him.

390
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,093
In the end, Priam came himself.

391
00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:54,294
The sight of this old man coming to ask for the body of his
son made many of the Greeks feel ashamed.

392
00:29:54,334 --> 00:30:04,175
Achilles realized that he was becoming very unpopular, so he rather sulkily offered to give up Hector's body - but only
in exchange for Hector's weight in gold.

393
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:11,895
The next day, Achilles told some sailors from his ships to
build a big set of scales outside the walls of Troy.

394
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,776
They used large pieces of wood from the ships for this.

395
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:17,656
Then Achilles dragged Hector's body to the scales.

396
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:21,776
He cut it loose from his chariot, picked it up, and dropped
it on the scales.

397
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:26,537
A group of servants came out from the city, each carrying
some of Priam's gold.

398
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:30,617
They opened the boxes and poured it out, and the scales
began to go down.

399
00:30:30,617 --> 00:30:35,418
But even after all the gold was there, it was still higher
than the side holding Hector's body.

400
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,458
Achilles laughed.

401
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:39,578
Then somebody moved, high up on the walls.

402
00:30:39,578 --> 00:30:41,698
It was Cassandra, Hector's sister.

403
00:30:41,738 --> 00:30:44,538
She took a gold bracelet off her arm, and dropped it.

404
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:47,019
Down and down it fell, turning in the sun.

405
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:48,739
It landed on the heap of gold.

406
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:52,139
The body rose as the gold sank to the ground.

407
00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:55,820
The Trojans took Hector's body away.

408
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,780
With Hector dead, there was no stopping Achilles.

409
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,940
Every time the Trojans came out, he beat them back.

410
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,460
The Trojans had other heroes, of course.

411
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:11,021
There was Aeneas, Hector's brother, but he didn't have the
same ability to encourage his men.

412
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:17,062
The Trojans had seen Achilles kill their greatest fighter,
and nobody was anxious to stand up to him.

413
00:31:17,062 --> 00:31:22,742
They began to stay in the city, and Achilles got in the
habit of walking around the walls and shouting insults.

414
00:31:22,742 --> 00:31:25,422
One day he went too far.

415
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:27,983
"Look how strong I am," he called out.

416
00:31:27,983 --> 00:31:29,823
"I could even beat the gods."

417
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:36,503
The gods were already growing tired of Achilles, because of his treatment of Hector, and his refusal to listen to his
mother, Thetis.

418
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:41,344
On Olympus, Apollo heard Achilles, and rose to his feet.

419
00:31:41,344 --> 00:31:46,584
At that moment, Paris was up on the walls, putting a
poisoned arrow to his bow.

420
00:31:46,624 --> 00:31:53,825
Paris was a better bowman than a fighter, but it was a long
shot, and he let fly more in hope than expectation.

421
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:57,506
But Apollo blew the arrow straight towards Achilles' foot.

422
00:31:57,546 --> 00:32:02,706
He was wearing the usual heavy sandals, which was perhaps a
sign of how confident he was.

423
00:32:02,706 --> 00:32:06,426
The arrow hit his left heel, the only weak part of his body.

424
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:12,507
He looked down in disbelief, then the arrow's deadly poison
began to work.

425
00:32:12,587 --> 00:32:17,587
There was a moment when you could see that he couldn't move
his leg, while his arms beat about with the pain.

426
00:32:17,627 --> 00:32:20,068
Then he cried a great cry and fell to the ground.

427
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:24,948
He rolled about for some time, calling out in a loud voice,
then was silent.

428
00:32:24,948 --> 00:32:32,229
The Greeks burnt Achilles' body in front of the walls, while
Paris went around the city telling everybody that he was the man who killed the great hero.

429
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:35,749
Everybody knew this anyway, and they soon got tired of
hearing it.

430
00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:41,550
One day, after the funeral was over, Paris was up on the
walls, shouting something.

431
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,910
A Greek bowman saw him and took aim with a poisoned arrow.

432
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:50,671
A good bowman can have three arrows in the air at the same
time, and this man was very good.

433
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:56,951
One of the three hit Paris, and that was the end of him.

434
00:32:56,951 --> 00:33:00,312
And so the man who had started the whole thing left the
field.

435
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,552
But the war went on.

436
00:33:01,552 --> 00:33:04,592
The death of Achilles left the Greeks in a sad mood.

437
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:12,713
He was their greatest hero, and in that time between the death of Patroclus and his own death, he had turned the tide
of the battles.

438
00:33:12,793 --> 00:33:18,913
Now there seemed to be no hope, just endless years of
waiting in front of those high walls.

439
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:22,634
However, some of them tried to think of a new way to win.

440
00:33:22,674 --> 00:33:33,195
Odysseus, who was one of the cleverest, thought he had an idea, but first he wanted to know more about the Trojans and
their city.

441
00:33:33,195 --> 00:33:40,475
He disguised himself as an ordinary slave, and slipped in through the gates one day when they were opened to let some
soldiers in.

442
00:33:40,475 --> 00:33:47,676
Once inside, he spent a long time walking through the streets, watching the people pass by, and the Trojan guards
up on the walls.

443
00:33:47,676 --> 00:33:52,957
At one point, when he was near the royal palace, Helen
looked down and recognized him.

444
00:33:52,957 --> 00:33:57,437
She hadn't seen him up close for many years, but they had
once known each other well.

445
00:33:57,437 --> 00:34:00,037
She waved her hand, and he looked up.

446
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:01,878
Then she made a sign for him to wait.

447
00:34:01,878 --> 00:34:04,998
A few minutes later, he saw her at one of the side doors.

448
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:06,358
She was smiling.

449
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:08,678
Helen led him upstairs to her private room.

450
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:10,158
She stood and looked at him.

451
00:34:10,158 --> 00:34:15,519
"Odysseus, it has been such a long time." He nodded his
head, not knowing quite what to say.

452
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,279
"I have no friends here now," she said, as if to gain his
sympathy.

453
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:31,640
"Not now that Hector is dead. His poor father is kind to me,
but we can't talk much. He is an old man, and he still cries for his son Hector. And Achilles is dead too, our greatest hero."

454
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,361
"And Paris," Odysseus said.

455
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:45,322
"I don't miss Paris. Our love didn't last long. Odysseus, I didn't know what I was doing. I'm sure Aphrodite put a magic
spell on me. I was happy with Menelaus."

456
00:34:45,322 --> 00:34:47,082
Odysseus looked around the room.

457
00:34:47,082 --> 00:34:49,322
Over by the window there was a loom.

458
00:34:49,322 --> 00:34:50,682
"Come and see," she said.

459
00:34:50,682 --> 00:34:52,402
"Keep back from the window."

460
00:34:52,402 --> 00:34:54,803
On the loom was a picture of the death of Achilles.

461
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:56,603
It was only partly finished.

462
00:34:56,723 --> 00:35:00,923
Achilles was huge, standing at the front with the arrow in
his heel.

463
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:04,444
High up on the wall there was a small figure that might have
been Paris.

464
00:35:04,444 --> 00:35:10,884
She showed him other pictures she had made, of the war and
of her homeland of Sparta.

465
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:14,765
Odysseus thought of Ithaca, where he had left his wife and
family.

466
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:16,685
It had been over ten years.

467
00:35:16,725 --> 00:35:20,885
Telemachus, his son, would be a young man now, almost.

468
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,925
And Penelope would be an older woman.

469
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:24,086
He turned to look at her.

470
00:35:24,086 --> 00:35:31,446
"Listen, Helen, I think I know how we can win this war, and
take you back to Menelaus, and your country."

471
00:35:31,446 --> 00:35:32,046
CHAPTER EIGHT

472
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:33,206
The Wooden Horse

473
00:35:33,206 --> 00:35:36,687
The next day, Odysseus told the other Greek leaders his
plan.

474
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:39,007
The Greeks pretended that they were going home.

475
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:45,088
Some of the soldiers broke up their camps, loaded everything
into the ships, and sailed away.

476
00:35:45,088 --> 00:35:47,328
However, they did not sail very far.

477
00:35:47,368 --> 00:35:50,288
There was an island nearby, and they hid the ships behind
it.

478
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:54,808
Then Odysseus went into the forest with a shipbuilder called
Epeius and some other men.

479
00:35:54,808 --> 00:35:59,009
They picked out fifty huge pine trees and cut them down.

480
00:35:59,009 --> 00:36:03,049
The Greeks used some of these trees to build a high wall on
the plain.

481
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:07,450
Then the Greeks set to work, and they built a huge wooden
horse.

482
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,250
It was so big that thirty men could hide inside it.

483
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:15,771
With Epeius and Odysseus in charge, the soldiers worked
fast.

484
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:21,531
Pine is soft wood and can be easily cut, and there were many
in the Greek army with experience of shipbuilding.

485
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:28,172
The hair on the horse's head and tail was painted purple and
gold, and valuable purple stones were used for its eyes.

486
00:36:28,212 --> 00:36:32,852
Under its legs were large wooden wheels so that it could be
moved forward.

487
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:36,773
When it was finished, it looked good enough to be a present
for the gods.

488
00:36:36,813 --> 00:36:39,773
This was exactly what Odysseus wanted.

489
00:36:39,773 --> 00:36:45,853
That night, he led thirty of his best soldiers up the ladder
and into the body of the horse.

490
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:48,334
They pulled the trap door shut behind them.

491
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:51,614
They had brought food and water, and they now settled down
to wait.

492
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:56,734
One man, Odysseus' cousin Sinon, waited in the shade near
the horse.

493
00:36:56,734 --> 00:36:59,935
The rest of the Greeks got into their ships and sailed away.

494
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:02,735
But they only went to join the other ships behind the
island.

495
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:04,855
Some men had climbed to the highest point.

496
00:37:04,895 --> 00:37:11,616
Now, lying hidden in the bushes, they watched to see what
the Trojans would do when morning came.

497
00:37:11,656 --> 00:37:13,656
On the ships, men also waited.

498
00:37:13,656 --> 00:37:14,736
Very few could sleep.

499
00:37:14,736 --> 00:37:18,777
They thought of their homes far away, of the wives and
children they had left behind.

500
00:37:18,777 --> 00:37:28,298
It had been a long war, and it was possible that Odysseus' idea would succeed where the strength and courage of
Achilles and all the other soldiers had failed.

501
00:37:28,298 --> 00:37:29,698
They waited, and hoped.

502
00:37:29,698 --> 00:37:33,618
When morning came, the Trojans on the walls saw that the
Greeks had gone.

503
00:37:33,658 --> 00:37:38,258
There were no tents, no soldiers, and no ships.

504
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:41,819
In their place, stood a huge wooden horse.

505
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,499
A group of soldiers walked towards the horse.

506
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:51,260
Before they arrived, the city gates opened and a large crowd
of people who had heard the news came running after them.

507
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,700
They all stood around the horse.

508
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,100
They looked at it and wondered why the Greeks had made it.

509
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:05,301
Then, an argument started between those who said it should be destroyed, and others who wanted to bring it into the
city.

510
00:38:05,301 --> 00:38:08,141
A man called Laocoon stepped forward.

511
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:11,662
He was priest of the sea-god Neptune, and he was very angry.

512
00:38:11,742 --> 00:38:13,542
"Are you mad?" he shouted.

513
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:23,103
"Don't you know the Greeks well enough not to trust them? I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts." Then he took a
spear and threw it at the horse's side.

514
00:38:23,103 --> 00:38:26,823
It hit the wood, and a great hollow sound echoed around the
crowd.

515
00:38:26,823 --> 00:38:29,943
They might have listened to him, but then something else
happened.

516
00:38:29,983 --> 00:38:33,304
A group of people dragged Sinon forward to the Trojan
leaders.

517
00:38:33,304 --> 00:38:36,024
"We found him hiding in the bushes," somebody said.

518
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,904
"He's a Greek," said another.

519
00:38:37,904 --> 00:38:40,344
"What are you doing here?" said a Trojan leader.

520
00:38:40,344 --> 00:38:42,585
"Tell the truth and we'll let you live."

521
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:45,825
Sinon said that he had been left behind because Odysseus
didn't like him.

522
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:47,745
"What about the horse?" the leader asked.

523
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:50,385
"It's an offering to Athena," Sinon said.

524
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:57,466
"But a prophet said it must be left outside Troy. If it is
taken into the city, nobody will defeat Troy."

525
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:58,546
It was all a lie, of course.

526
00:38:58,546 --> 00:39:01,507
There was no prophet, but the Trojans believed Sinon.

527
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:07,987
The Greeks had gone, and they had nothing to show for over
ten years of war except death and suffering.

528
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:11,147
The horse meant that they had at least taken something from
the Greeks.

529
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:15,548
So all the musicians, singers, and dancers in the city came
out.

530
00:39:15,548 --> 00:39:18,908
People pushed from behind, and the horse began to move.

531
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:25,349
All the way to the city and through the main gate, there was
shouting and cheering, songs and laughter.

532
00:39:25,389 --> 00:39:27,469
Then people brought food and wine.

533
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:29,749
The eating and drinking went on all day.

534
00:39:29,749 --> 00:39:34,110
Inside the horse, Odysseus and his men waited for night to
come.

535
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:38,790
High up on Mount Olympus, the goddess Athena looked down on
Troy.

536
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,310
She could see the end coming, and it was close.

537
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,711
She thought of the help that she had given to Troy over the
years.

538
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:46,671
Was it all going to come to nothing?

539
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:49,311
She decided to try one last time.

540
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:53,872
In the royal palace, Helen was making a new picture on her
loom.

541
00:39:53,912 --> 00:39:56,912
It showed the wooden horse standing inside the gates of
Troy.

542
00:39:56,912 --> 00:40:00,952
It didn't show that there were Greeks inside the horse, but
Helen knew this.

543
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:05,193
Aphrodite put a magic spell on Helen, and she got up from
her loom.

544
00:40:05,193 --> 00:40:07,513
She went down into the street.

545
00:40:07,513 --> 00:40:10,833
There was a soldier standing there, guarding the palace.

546
00:40:10,873 --> 00:40:14,994
After all the food and wine, he was as sleepy as everyone
else.

547
00:40:15,034 --> 00:40:16,874
"Come with me," Helen said.

548
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:19,474
The soldier followed her, complaining a little.

549
00:40:19,554 --> 00:40:21,994
Helen went and stood below the horse.

550
00:40:21,994 --> 00:40:25,155
Then she called out to each of the Greek soldiers inside.

551
00:40:25,155 --> 00:40:31,235
Aphrodite's magic made her voice change with every name, so
that it sounded like their wives and children.

552
00:40:31,235 --> 00:40:34,796
"Odysseus," she called, in the voice of his wife, Penelope.

553
00:40:34,836 --> 00:40:37,796
Inside the horse, Odysseus bit his lip.

554
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:41,236
He knew it was a trick, but the tears came to his eyes all
the same.

555
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:44,076
And so it was with all the Greeks inside the horse.

556
00:40:44,116 --> 00:40:49,597
They all cried when they heard the voices of the loved ones
they had not seen for many years.

557
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:55,798
Only one man started to answer back, but as soon as his
mouth opened, Odysseus put a hand over it.

558
00:40:55,798 --> 00:41:01,478
After that, they all stood as still as statues while Helen
called name after name.

559
00:41:01,518 --> 00:41:06,119
Down below, the soldier yawned, and looked up at the stars.

560
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,159
"There's no one there," he said.

561
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,959
"I have to go back to the palace."

562
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:17,280
In the place where the Greeks had built the horse, Sinon had
collected all the leftover pieces of wood and made them into a huge pile.

563
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:22,320
Now he took a burning torch, and pushed it into the middle
of the pile.

564
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,440
The wood was dry and the fire spread quickly.

565
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,641
On the island, the Greek lookouts saw the red glow from the
fire in the sky.

566
00:41:29,641 --> 00:41:31,321
They ran down to their ships.

567
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:32,401
CHAPTER NINE

568
00:41:32,481 --> 00:41:33,281
The Fall of Troy

569
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:38,882
One by one, the Greek ships came round each end of the
island and pointed their fronts towards Troy.

570
00:41:38,922 --> 00:41:43,042
Sinon went back inside the city and found a high place near
the wooden horse.

571
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,802
There he waited and watched.

572
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:48,043
The night was clear, and he saw the ships when they were far
away.

573
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:50,243
He was the only one to notice.

574
00:41:50,243 --> 00:41:53,523
The guards on the walls were either drunk, or asleep.

575
00:41:53,523 --> 00:42:01,524
When the first ships hit the beach, Sinon ran quietly across
the courtyard, stood beneath the horse, and waved to the men above.

576
00:42:01,524 --> 00:42:06,444
A few seconds later, the trap door opened.

577
00:42:06,444 --> 00:42:09,765
A rope ladder was lowered and Odysseus climbed down.

578
00:42:09,805 --> 00:42:16,485
They embraced and exchanged a few words, then Odysseus led
the first of the Greeks across to the main gate.

579
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:23,006
The guards died without ever waking up, and the Greeks began
to pull open the heavy gates.

580
00:42:23,006 --> 00:42:26,926
The gates swung open and a great number of men came into the
courtyard.

581
00:42:26,926 --> 00:42:30,487
A shout went up, which wakened many of the sleeping Trojans.

582
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:36,687
Soldiers pulled themselves to their feet and looked around
for their weapons, but it was already too late.

583
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:39,208
The Greeks ran everywhere through the city.

584
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:43,968
They had ten years of anger inside them, and they killed
every Trojan man they could find.

585
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:47,768
Usually, they let the women and children live, but some of
these died as well.

586
00:42:47,808 --> 00:42:53,089
Hector's baby son was dragged from his mother's arms and
thrown down from the high walls to his death.

587
00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:56,809
In the royal palace, the old King Priam slowly put on his
armor.

588
00:42:56,809 --> 00:43:00,170
His wife, Hecuba, came in and told him to stop.

589
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:02,850
There were younger men to do the fighting.

590
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:06,810
Instead, Priam took his wife and his daughter to the temple
of Zeus to pray.

591
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:11,651
While they were standing there, the door crashed open and
his youngest son, Polities, came in.

592
00:43:11,651 --> 00:43:17,571
He was holding his stomach, and the blood ran through his
fingers onto the floor.

593
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:21,212
Through the door after him came Pyrrhus, a son of Achilles.

594
00:43:21,252 --> 00:43:23,092
There was blood on his sword.

595
00:43:23,092 --> 00:43:24,452
He didn't need to do any more.

596
00:43:24,452 --> 00:43:29,372
Polities took two or three steps towards his father, fell on
the floor and died.

597
00:43:29,412 --> 00:43:30,493
He hadn't said a word.

598
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:32,653
Priam said a word then, and it was a strong one.

599
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:33,373
Then he picked up his spear.

600
00:43:33,373 --> 00:43:36,093
With an old and weak hand, he threw it at Pyrrhus, who
brushed it aside, stepped in, and killed Priam with his
sword.

601
00:43:36,093 --> 00:43:38,013
Hecuba, Cassandra, and Hector's wife Andromache became his
prisoners that night.

602
00:43:38,053 --> 00:43:38,653
Helen was with them.

603
00:43:38,653 --> 00:43:40,334
He took her through the burning streets to Menelaus.

604
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,814
They looked at each other, and held hands.

605
00:43:42,894 --> 00:43:46,694
Words would come later, but for the moment, neither of them
spoke.

606
00:43:46,694 --> 00:43:53,055
Later, with their ships loaded with treasure and Trojan
women, the Greeks sailed for home.

607
00:43:53,055 --> 00:43:57,615
The gods were angry that so many Trojans had been killed,
especially King Priam.

608
00:43:57,655 --> 00:44:00,215
They were thinking about ways to punish the Greeks.

609
00:44:00,255 --> 00:44:03,776
Some of the heroes would take a long time to reach home.

610
00:44:03,776 --> 00:44:06,016
Some would not return at all.
