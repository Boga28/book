00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:02,330
PART ONE
Young love

00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,870
CHPATER ONE
Two young lives

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,599
March 1945

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:18,640
'Megan, make me a cup of tea, will you?'

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,370
shouted Harry Jenkins from the front of his
small shop.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:26,870
'And then come in here and talk to me.'

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:38,420
'Here you are, Dad,' said Megan, giving him
a big cup of hot tea and trying to smile.

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,730
Every day it was the same.

9
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:47,260
As soon as Megan got home from school, her
father asked for his tea and then he wanted

10
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:54,109
to know everything about her day - what she
had done at school, if the teachers were pleased

11
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:57,980
with her work, who she walked home with.

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,699
She was sixteen years old and she was fed
up with it all.

13
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:08,270
Why did he have to be so interested in her?

14
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,660
'So, Megan, how was school today?'

15
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,610
'OK,' said Megan.

16
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:22,620
'Did the teacher tell you about last week's
exam, then?'

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,800
'Yes.'

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,330
'And?' asked Mr Jenkins.

19
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:35,040
'And what?' said Megan, knowing very well
what he wanted to know.

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,200
'And, how did you do?

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:47,970
Come on, girl, if you're going to go to college,
it's important that you do well at school.'

22
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:55,530
Nobody from Mr Jenkins' family had ever gone
to college, but now there might be a chance

23
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,620
for Megan.

24
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,390
He wanted, her to get away.

25
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,220
The Welsh village of Tredonald where they
lived was a coal mining village.

26
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:12,099
Nearly all the men worked down the mine, getting
the dirty black coal out of the ground.

27
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:19,769
Mr Jenkins didn't want his daughter to marry
a coal miner, or even to spend her life working

28
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:24,310
in the shop - she was too good for that.

29
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,590
He hadn't asked Megan what she wanted.

30
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,409
At the other end of the village, Megan's friend,
Huw Thomas, was finishing his work for the

31
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:36,409
day.

32
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:44,019
Huw was also sixteen years old and already
tired of life.

33
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:50,819
He worked eight hours a day, five days a week
in the village coal mine.

34
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,530
There was nothing much else for people in
the village.

35
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,840
You either worked underground, or you didn't
work at all.

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,810
That was it.

37
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,310
But it was better than being a soldier and
fighting in some foreign country, like a few

38
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,409
of the men in the village.

39
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:16,590
The prime minister in London kept saying the
war was nearly over, but Huw wasn't sure if

40
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,090
he believed it.

41
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:25,230
Huw got into the lift at the bottom of the
mine with a group of other tired-looking men.

42
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:33,010
Their faces were black from the coal and at
first he didn't see his older brother, Gareth,

43
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,340
standing opposite him.

44
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,969
They smiled at each other, but didn't speak.

45
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:45,169
The lift climbed slowly and noisily up from
the dark underground world.

46
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:49,769
Fen dirty faces looked up towards the light.

47
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:58,500
At the top, it took a few seconds for their
eyes to get used to the daylight.

48
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,609
They walked over to the bath house, taking
in the fresh air.

49
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:08,769
For Huw this was the best moment of the day.

50
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:15,709
He had only been a miner for six weeks, but
it felt like longer.

51
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,709
Gareth was waiting for him outside.

52
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,180
'All right, Huw?' asked Gareth.

53
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,090
'How was it today?'

54
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,870
'OK,' Huw said.

55
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,510
'It'll get better, I hope.'

56
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,730
'It will,' his brother replied.

57
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,669
'Look at you.

58
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:41,470
Your arms are stronger already, after only
five weeks.'

59
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,050
'Six weeks,' said Huw.

60
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,340
Gareth laughed.

61
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,560
'It's hard work, all right.

62
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,910
But we're lucky to have jobs.

63
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,680
We need the money, with Dad not working.'

64
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:05,330
Huw couldn't remember the last time his father
had had a job.

65
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,870
Some days, his father left the house early
in the morning and came home with a bit of

66
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,900
money, or something for them to eat.

67
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,000
And some days he didn't come home at all.

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,820
Life was not easy for the Thomas family.

69
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:30,860
The two brothers walked down their street
and said 'hello' to the wives, sisters and

70
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,470
daughters who had come out of their houses
to welcome home their returning men.

71
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:43,330
But outside Huw's house there was no-one to
welcome them home.

72
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,009
Huw had never known his mother.

73
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:51,580
She had died when he was born.

74
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:58,990
His father and his two brothers, Richard and
Gareth, had been his family.

75
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:06,580
And now there was no Richard - killed two
years ago while fighting in North Africa.

76
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,370
'Dad!' shouted Gareth.

77
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,900
'We're home.

78
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,690
What's for dinner?'

79
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,919
There was no answer.

80
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,470
'Must be out,' said Huw.

81
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,780
'Or in bed,' Gareth said.

82
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,250
'I'll go and look.'

83
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:37,620
As soon as Gareth entered the bedroom the
smell of whisky hit him.

84
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,910
His father was asleep on the bed with all
his clothes on.

85
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,330
'Drunk again,' Gareth told Huw.

86
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:54,770
'Where does he get the money from to go to
the pub?

87
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,890
You didn't leave any in the house, did you?'

88
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,440
'No, of course not.

89
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,120
Except for the money in the box to pay Mr
Jenkins for last week's food.

90
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,500
But he doesn't know where we keep that, does
he?'

91
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,240
Huw took out the small box from its hiding
place.

92
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,789
He opened it.

93
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:21,190
'He's taken it all!'

94
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:28,199
'Well,' said Gareth, 'you'll have to go and
explain to Mr Jenkins that we can't pay him

95
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,170
until the end of the week.'

96
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:38,050
Gareth moved around the small kitchen angrily
opening cupboards looking for food.

97
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,870
'And ask him if he'll give us some bread or
potatoes.

98
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,620
He can add it to next week's bill,' he said.

99
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:56,150
'Why is it always me who has to explain?'
asked Huw.

100
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:02,729
'Because you're the youngest and Mr Jenkins
might feel sorry for you,' replied Gareth.

101
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:04,930
'Go on, Huw.

102
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,930
I'm hungry.'

103
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:16,370
Huw knew why his father got drunk, but knowing
didn't help.

104
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,970
He was angry with his father.

105
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:26,520
Nobody would give work to a forty-year-old
man with a drink problem, so Huw had had to

106
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,699
leave school and start earning money.

107
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:39,200
Megan looked up from her book and saw Huw
coming into the shop.

108
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,380
She thought he looked tired and angry.

109
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,180
'Hello, Huw,' she said smiling.

110
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,700
'You OK?'

111
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,220
'Not really...

112
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:54,810
the usual things,' said Huw.

113
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:00,279
Megan and all the village knew about Huw's
father.

114
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,540
Mr Jenkins listened while Huw explained the
latest story.

115
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:11,899
Mr Jenkins felt sorry for Huw, but there was
nothing he could do about it.

116
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:14,510
Life was hard for everybody.

117
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,779
It was wartime.

118
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:22,850
Other families had lost sons in the war: David
Thomas was not the only one.

119
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:32,190
But he was the only one who had started drinking,
leaving his two sons to look after themselves.

120
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:37,310
Megan said, 'Feel like going for a walk later,
Huw?'

121
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,470
She and Huw had been friends for years.

122
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:46,899
They used to sit together at school, and out
of school they spent a lot of time with each

123
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:48,790
other.

124
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,530
Now their friendship seemed to be getting
even stronger.

125
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,880
'Yeah, great,' replied Huw.

126
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,380
'I'll come here at about seven.

127
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,720
Is that all right, Mr Jenkins?'

128
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:13,970
'Yes, but not for long, Megan,' said Mr Jenkins,
putting a few potatoes in a bag for Huw.

129
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,620
'You've got school tomorrow, remember.'

130
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:25,889
But Megan knew the real reason that her father
didn't want her to be out with Huw for long

131
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:29,630
- he was worried about their continuing friendship.

132
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:38,670
They were not children any more and Mr Jenkins
had seen how Huw looked at his daughter.

133
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:45,660
CHAPTER TWO
The friendship continues

134
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,440
Megan lay on the grass by the river with her
hands behind her head, looking up at the sky

135
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,500
and singing softly.

136
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:02,890
'Don't move, will you?' said Huw with his
back against a tree.

137
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,830
'I'm trying to draw you.'

138
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:12,170
Megan lay there and enjoyed the warm evening.

139
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,640
Sometimes she didn't know what to say to Huw.

140
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:23,389
Since he had started work, their lives were
no longer the same, and she knew he was not

141
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,290
happy down the mine.

142
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:31,750
But this evening, she felt he was the best
person in her life.

143
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,300
'What do you think?'

144
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,760
asked Huw as he gave her the drawing.

145
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,699
He lay down beside her.

146
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,910
'One day, I'll be rich.'

147
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:49,680
'Oh yeah, how?' she asked.

148
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,949
'I'll sell my drawings to someone, or maybe
I'll go to London and find a good job,' he

149
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:57,949
replied.

150
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:00,630
'I like your drawings.

151
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,370
I think you're a really good artist,' she
said.

152
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,620
'But nobody around here has got any money
to spend on things like that.

153
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:17,670
And going to London is a bad idea - the war
has made it a dangerous place to be.'

154
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:25,670
'Oh Megan, I can dream, can't I?' replied
Huw.

155
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,630
'Don't you have any dreams?'

156
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:36,079
'Yes, but they seem to change every day,'
she said laughing.

157
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,730
'Come on!'

158
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,509
Megan jumped up and pulled Huw to his feet.

159
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:46,949
'Let's walk a bit more, then I'll have to
go home.'

160
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:52,750
'Can I touch your hair, Megan?' asked Huw
suddenly.

161
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,339
'It looks so soft.'

162
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,959
Megan was surprised, but she said he could.

163
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,330
It was nice to feel his fingers running through
her hair.

164
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,709
Her face began to burn.

165
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,740
Huw looked at her and kissed her.

166
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,390
It seemed the right thing to do.

167
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:23,190
'Don't,' said Megan, but didn't move away.

168
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:30,579
'If my father could see us now, he'd never
let me come out with you again.'

169
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:37,190
'Sorry,' said Huw, not quite knowing what
to do next.

170
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:43,089
There were all sorts of feelings inside him
that were new and wonderful.

171
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:50,319
'Megan, do you like me?' asked Huw, still
standing close to her.

172
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:55,360
'Yes, of course I do,' replied Megan.

173
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:03,920
'We've been friends for long enough - you
know I like you.'

174
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
'But I mean...

175
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,480
"like" in a different way, not just as brother
and sister,' said Huw.

176
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,740
'I think you're wonderful.

177
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,180
Will you be my girl?'

178
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:22,490
'Oh Huw, yes, I will be your girl,' said Megan.

179
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,920
'But we mustn't tell anyone.

180
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,399
My parents...'

181
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,699
But Huw stopped her.

182
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:36,840
'And if we both feel the same in two years'
time, then I shall ask your father if I can

183
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,360
marry you.'

184
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,410
Huw's mind was running ahead.

185
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,410
Megan laughed.

186
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:52,000
'Yes, but for now we must make everyone think
that we're still just friends.

187
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,970
Nobody must see us holding hands or anything.

188
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:03,440
If my father hears about us, he'll stop me
from seeing you.

189
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,089
You know what he's like.'

190
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:10,839
They walked home, happy in each other's company.

191
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:18,360
Huw forgot his problems at home and work,
and Megan forgot the college plans her father

192
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,690
had for her.

193
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,980
She knew he had high hopes for her.

194
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,370
And a poor coal miner with a drunken father
was not one of them.

195
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,500
CHPATER THREE
Romance grows

196
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:43,029
Over the next few months, life in the mining
village continued in much the same way.

197
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:50,769
When the war in Europe ended, there were wonderful
parties in the streets of Tredonald.

198
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:56,379
Everybody hoped that life would be a lot easier
- but it wasn't.

199
00:15:56,379 --> 00:16:03,579
People worked as hard as ever, and there was
still very little to buy in the shops.

200
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:12,089
Megan and Huw spent as much time as possible
together, taking long walks in the evenings

201
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:16,490
or sometimes going to the Saturday night dances
in the village.

202
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:22,649
'Will you dance with me on Saturday, Huw?'

203
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:28,800
Megan asked as they sat together one evening
on top of the hill, looking down on the village.

204
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,589
'Of course, if you're not too busy dancing
with other men,' he replied.

205
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:40,070
Huw loved dancing with Megan.

206
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,769
It was the one time he could put his arms
round her in public.

207
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:50,970
And if they planned it carefully, they were
sometimes able to walk home together.

208
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,149
They had become good at keeping their love
hidden.

209
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:02,710
But they had to dance with other people, too,
and Huw hated the way other men held Megan

210
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:06,980
so close that her body was pressed against
them.

211
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,750
'What about you?' said Megan.

212
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:18,940
'You danced with Ruth Hopkins for ages last
month... and you were laughing!'

213
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,630
Huw remembered that evening, too.

214
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,310
He had enjoyed Megan watching him dancing
with Ruth.

215
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,870
But it had been a quiet walk home that night.

216
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:36,370
In winter, it became difficult to go for walks.

217
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,640
It was dark when Huw finished work and the
weather was cold.

218
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,960
And every time he went to the shop, Mr Jenkins
was there.

219
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:56,590
'I wish we had somewhere warm to go,' said
Megan one cold and windy day in February.

220
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:03,350
'What are you doing on Saturday evening?'
asked Huw.

221
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:10,490
'Nothing - studying or helping at home.

222
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,679
Why?'

223
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,159
'Do you think you could come out?' said Huw.

224
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,610
'There's a new American film on in Afon.

225
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,950
Let's go.'

226
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,640
'It's a long way.

227
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,010
How will we get there?'

228
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,220
Megan asked...

229
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,250
'I'll borrow a couple of bicycles,' said Huw.

230
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:37,190
'Can you think of something to tell your parents?'

231
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:44,520
'Not at the moment, but I will before Saturday,'
replied Megan.

232
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:53,250
The thought of sitting in a warm, comfortable
place with Huw for two hours was wonderful.

233
00:18:53,250 --> 00:19:00,120
She would think of some story to tell her
parents.

234
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,880
Anything.

235
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,930
On Friday afternoon, Huw was on his way home
from the mine when he met Gareth on his way

236
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,429
to work.

237
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:17,200
The mine was open twenty-four hours a day
and Gareth was working nights that week.

238
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,180
Huw didn't like it when he and Gareth worked
at different times - they never seemed to

239
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,400
see each other.

240
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,490
At home, Huw took some money out of the money
box.

241
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:37,200
He tried not to think what Gareth would say
if he knew.

242
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,420
But he wanted to buy Megan a present.

243
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:49,360
This Saturday was going to be a night to remember.

244
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
* * *

245
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,920
Saturday evening at the cinema was wonderful.

246
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:59,140
Being away from the village made Megan and
Huw feel free.

247
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:06,260
For once, they were able to walk down the
street holding hands, without thinking about

248
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:14,560
other people seeing them, and in the cinema
they both found it difficult to watch the

249
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,210
film.

250
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,520
'Huw, stop...

251
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,700
please,' said Megan quietly after a long kiss.

252
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:31,470
'We should try and watch a bit of the film.'

253
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,230
But they soon turned to each other again.

254
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:42,659
The lights went on as the film ended and they
stood up slowly.

255
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,640
Neither of them wanted to leave.

256
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,720
Outside was real life; inside they could be
together.

257
00:20:52,720 --> 00:21:00,010
They cycled back towards Tredonald and Megan
could feel her heart getting heavier as they

258
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,900
got nearer.

259
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,179
They stopped just round the corner from her
flat.

260
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:14,909
'This is for you, Megan,' said Huw, giving
her a small box.

261
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:18,460
'I hope you like it.'

262
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:24,490
He watched her face as she took out the silver
necklace.

263
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,700
'It's only second-hand,' he continued.

264
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,050
'One day I'll buy you a new one.'

265
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:44,570
'Oh Huw, I don't want a new one, this is lovely,'
said Megan, putting it round her neck.

266
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,730
'But it must have cost you a lot.'

267
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,010
She knew he didn't have much money.

268
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,220
'Come here, my girl,' he said.

269
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,280
'Stop talking and give me a goodnight kiss.'

270
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:04,610
But suddenly there was a loud noise from the
mine.

271
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,220
'Christ!' said Huw.

272
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,570
'What the hell was that!'

273
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,070
But they both knew what it was.

274
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:18,070
It was the sound the village hoped they would
never hear.

275
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,960
All along the street, doors opened and men
and women came out.

276
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:30,390
They ran towards the mine, all thinking of
the men who might be caught five-hundred metres

277
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:41,270
below the ground: 'Please God, don't let it
be my husband, my brother or my son.'

278
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:47,039
CHAPTER FOUR
Death at the mine

279
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:55,289
People of all ages stood around in small groups,
talking in low voices, it was three o'clock

280
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:59,830
in the morning, four hours later.

281
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,600
Huw was standing with his father.

282
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:10,640
One look at his father's face had told Huw
what he didn't want to know: Gareth was down

283
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,419
the mine.

284
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:18,909
Part of the roof of a tunnel had fallen down
and some miners were on the wrong side of

285
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:20,040
the fallen rock.

286
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:26,680
A team of men had been called in to help and
had brought up ten men safely.

287
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:33,400
As this group arrived at the top, the waiting
families pressed forward looking for their

288
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,270
loved ones.

289
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,340
Gareth was not one of the ten.

290
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,080
The mine manager came over to Huw and his
father.

291
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,670
There's still hope, David,' he said.

292
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:54,940
'The team say they can hear noises behind
the rock,'

293
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,890
'How many are still down there?' asked Huw.

294
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,020
'Five.

295
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:07,510
It'll take some time before we reach them.'

296
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:14,809
Huw and his father said nothing, and the mine
manager walked away to say the same thing

297
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:16,820
to another family.

298
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:28,090
During the long wait David Thomas and his
son, Huw, stood together without speaking.

299
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:34,210
From time to time, one of them lit a cigarette
and they drank tea which was given to them

300
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,649
by kind neighbours.

301
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:44,130
Megan came and stood with them and put her
hand into Huw's.

302
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:52,539
She looked into his eyes and saw he was afraid.

303
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:56,710
It was ten o'clock when they brought out Gareth's
body.

304
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:01,360
He and two other men had died in the rockfall.

305
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,799
The two others had been lucky.

306
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,130
Gareth came home to the small house.

307
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:16,429
His body lay in the front room and his father
sat beside him.

308
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:23,419
The neighbours came to say a sad goodbye to
the young man they had known so well.

309
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:28,760
Huw's father said nothing as people came and
went.

310
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:35,950
He sat by Gareth's side until it grew dark.

311
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:43,070
When Huw came in to say goodnight, it was
as if his father hadn't heard.

312
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:48,520
Huw woke in the middle of the night and couldn't
get back to sleep.

313
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:56,250
It seemed wrong to be safe and warm in bed
while his brother lay cold downstairs.

314
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:02,580
He decided he would go and sit with Gareth.

315
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,700
He got out of bed and walked towards the front
room.

316
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:12,570
As he got there, he saw the door was open
a little.

317
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,690
He stopped.

318
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:23,940
By the light of the moon, Huw could just see
his father: he hadn't moved from his son's

319
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,740
side.

320
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:34,559
In the quiet, Huw could hear his father's
crying and his low voice asking again and

321
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,539
again why this had happened.

322
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:45,940
But his words fell into darkness and were
lost.

323
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:51,830
Slowly, Huw turned and went back to bed.

324
00:26:51,830 --> 00:27:02,919
He stared into the night for a long time and
let the hot wet tears run down his cheeks.

325
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:10,049
For a few days after Gareth's death, Huw's
father sat at home.

326
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:19,870
He and Huw slowly began to talk - first about
Gareth and then about Richard's death in the

327
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,410
war in North Africa.

328
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:30,240
Both of them cried and tried to help each
other, but Huw could see that deep inside,

329
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,360
his father was angry.

330
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:48,760
Angry because death had taken away three people
he loved - his wife, Richard, and now Gareth.

331
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:54,539
'Just you and me now, boy,' said his father.

332
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,440
'I don't want you to go back down that mine.'

333
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,539
'I've got to, Dad, you know that,' replied
Huw.

334
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:06,980
'What else can I do?

335
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:14,390
There's nothing in Tredonald - only the mine.'

336
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,470
His father said nothing.

337
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:23,250
That evening Huw met Megan down by the river.

338
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,750
It was their first time alone since Gareth's
death.

339
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:34,940
She listened as he talked about how empty
the house was without his brother.

340
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:43,929
Gareth had taken care of Huw when he was younger
and together they had looked after their father.

341
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:47,630
Without him, he felt alone.

342
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:52,130
'You're not alone,' said Megan.

343
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,940
'You have me.

344
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,860
Nothing will change that.'

345
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:02,700
She could see that Huw was hurting inside.

346
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:11,510
She wanted to wash it all away, but knew that
the only thing she could do was listen.

347
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:18,100
Huw loved her for being so strong and understanding.

348
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:24,289
Suddenly, he took hold of both her hands.

349
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:28,820
'Will you marry me?' said Huw.

350
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,820
'What?

351
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,409
Yes, of course I will,' smiled Megan.

352
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:34,409
'But

353
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:36,429
'Don't say "but".

354
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:40,059
I know all about the "buts",' replied Huw.

355
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:45,059
'It's enough that you've said "yes".'

356
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:53,680
They kissed and only stopped when Megan felt
the tears running down Huw's face.

357
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,559
Megan and Huw walked slowly back towards her
home.

358
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:08,190
'Hey look, there's your Mum and Dad,' said
Huw, watching as Mr and Mrs Jenkins closed

359
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,200
the front door of the shop behind them.

360
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,270
'Yes, they're going to visit Aunt Mary,' replied
Megan.

361
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:22,520
'You can come in, if you like.'

362
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:30,140
They went upstairs to the flat above the shop
where Megan and her family lived.

363
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:37,100
Megan realised it was the first time she and
Huw had been there alone.

364
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:42,760
There was a warm fire burning in the sitting
room.

365
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:50,769
They sat together on the sofa and talked,
and Huw cried some more.

366
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:55,070
Megan held him in her arms until he was quiet.

367
00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:04,540
Then they started kissing and their kisses
became stronger and stronger.

368
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,960
Megan got up and went out of the room.

369
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:16,250
Huw didn't know what to do, but just then
she returned.

370
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:22,039
She had taken off all her clothes and was
standing there with the light of the fire

371
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,269
behind her.

372
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:28,220
'Oh Megan, you're beautiful,' said Huw.

373
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:36,380
'But... are you sure this is what you want?'

374
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:41,179
'Yes, Huw,' said Megan in a quiet voice.

375
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:45,519
'Don't talk, just come to me.'

376
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,799
They made love on the floor.

377
00:31:50,799 --> 00:32:00,410
For both of them it was the first time and
it was wonderful.

378
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:03,909
CHPATER FIVE
Leaving Tredonald

379
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:13,540
The day that Huw went back to work, his father
started drinking again.

380
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,419
It was a terrible day for both of them.

381
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:20,790
Huw had to make himself get into the mine
lift.

382
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:26,840
It was very difficult for him to go down to
the place where Gareth had died only a week

383
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
before.

384
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:37,700
Half an hour after Huw had left the house,
David Thomas walked into the Red Lion pub

385
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,019
and stayed there all day.

386
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:47,710
His own house was too quiet, and remembering
was too painful.

387
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:51,680
Drinking took away all the hurt.

388
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,080
So, in the Red Lion, he drank and forgot.

389
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Over the next few weeks, there were days when
father and son never met.

390
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,799
But one day, Huw got a call from the police
station.

391
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:13,419
David Thomas had started a fight in a pub.

392
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:19,769
The police were called and Mr Thomas was taken
to the police station.

393
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:26,690
'He broke some tables and chairs in there,
you know,' said the policeman to Huw.

394
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:34,470
'He's a strong man, your Dad - and even stronger
when he's had a bit to drink.'

395
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,950
'I know,' said Huw.

396
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,559
'What happens now?'

397
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,639
'Well, you're lucky,' replied the policeman.

398
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:50,250
'Old Brian Morgan, the pub manager, said he
won't take the matter any further.

399
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,649
And we won't either...

400
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:53,850
this time.

401
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,650
But it must never happen again.'

402
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:05,150
'We can't go on like this,' said Huw to his
father, as they walked back home.

403
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,390
'I know, son, I know.

404
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,410
I promise I'll stop.

405
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:16,050
It won't happen again, you'll see.'

406
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:20,600
But David Thomas's promises didn't last very
long.

407
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,830
Soon he started drinking again.

408
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:31,280
The people in the village had understood at
first: 'Poor David, he's had a lot of sadness

409
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,630
in his life.'

410
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,010
Now it had all changed.

411
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:41,020
Even his friends were no longer so patient
with him.

412
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:46,890
Huw's time with Megan was the only time he
felt really happy.

413
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:50,710
Their love for each other was strong.

414
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,390
They talked about their present and their
future.

415
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:59,590
They talked about Gareth, which was good for
Huw.

416
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:06,900
His father often got angry when Gareth's name
was spoken at home, but Huw needed to remember

417
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,010
his brother.

418
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:16,130
'You know, Megan,' said Huw very quietly,
as they sat on top of the hill.

419
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:21,200
'My father has got to get away from here.

420
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,910
I think it's his only chance of getting his
life together.

421
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:33,760
If he stays here, the drink will kill him
- one way or another.

422
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,350
And I don't think I can let that happen.'

423
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:41,830
'What are you saying, Huw?' said Megan.

424
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:46,810
She could see from his face that it was difficult
for him to speak.

425
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:51,700
And there was a bad feeling growing inside
her.

426
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,600
Huw looked at her and continued.

427
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:02,520
'We had a letter, when Gareth died, from Uncle
Edward in Canada.

428
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,510
He's Dad's brother.

429
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:09,150
He went to Toronto when I was about four.

430
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,820
Anyway, he's asked us to go and live with
him.

431
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:19,830
He says he'll send the money for the boat.'

432
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,710
And do you want to go?'

433
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,050
Megan asked.

434
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,990
'Oh Megan, how can you ask that?

435
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:33,230
You know I don't ever want to leave you,'
answered Huw.

436
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,460
'But if...

437
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,460
'

438
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,750
'Can't your Dad go on his own?'

439
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,870
Megan's voice was very quiet.

440
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,220
'Don't you see?

441
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:50,630
I'm part of the problem,' said Huw, holding
Megan's face in his hands.

442
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:55,270
'He won't go and leave me working in the mine.

443
00:36:55,270 --> 00:37:01,450
I see him looking at me and remembering what
happened to Gareth.

444
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:06,720
He hates the mine and everything in Tredonald.'

445
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,510
'And what about us, Huw?'

446
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,850
There was sadness in Megan's voice.

447
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:21,510
'You are the most beautiful thing in my life,
Megan,' said Huw.

448
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,010
'I won't lose you.

449
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:28,380
But I have to go with him.'

450
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:34,860
Huw pulled her into his arms and for a few
minutes they held each other.

451
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:40,450
'Do you think you can wait for me?' asked
Huw.

452
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,360
'I don't know.

453
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,910
What do you mean?

454
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:50,860
Wait until you come back, wait for how long?'

455
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:55,910
Megan began to cry, Huw held her closer.

456
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:01,120
'Uncle Edward says there's lots of well-paid
work in Toronto.

457
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,110
It's a big city, not like here.

458
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:10,070
I might even be able to do something with
my art.

459
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:17,980
I know I'll be able to earn money quickly,
and I won't spend much.'

460
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,060
Huw was talking fast now.

461
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:32,280
And then, say, in a year I'll be able to pay
for you to come out and join me or... or I'll

462
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:40,090
come back here and we'll get married and both
of us can go back to Canada.'

463
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:47,210
'You seem to have everything planned,' said
Megan in surprise.

464
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:52,170
'No, I haven't, but do you think it's possible?'

465
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:59,160
'Yes... oh I don't know...' said Megan.

466
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:06,250
'Shall I talk to your parents about our plans?'
asked Huw.

467
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,110
'No, not now,' answered Megan.

468
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,370
'I'll talk to them.

469
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:18,470
I'll have lots of time to choose the right
moment.'

470
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,280
'And another thing.

471
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:26,330
If I can earn some good money in Toronto,
your father may realise that I'm different

472
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:35,070
- not just a village coal miner, but someone
with a future, someone good enough for his

473
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,860
darling daughter.'

474
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:45,610
Huw knew Mr Jenkins would be happy to see
him go to Canada.

475
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:50,830
'Oh, Huw,' said Megan.

476
00:39:50,830 --> 00:40:02,000
She couldn't believe how this evening's conversation
had completely changed her world.

477
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
***

478
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:12,960
So on April 28th 1946, David Thomas and his
only son, Huw, left the village of Tredonald

479
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,350
for a new life in Canada.

480
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:22,030
For Huw and Megan, saying goodbye was the
hardest thing they'd ever had to do.

481
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:26,330
They met in their usual place by the river.

482
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:34,690
'I'll think about you every day,' Huw said,
holding her close and never wanting to let

483
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,690
go.

484
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:40,900
And I'll write the minute I get there.'

485
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,430
Megan was crying onto his shoulder.

486
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:52,050
'I know you think I'm a strong person, but
when you're in a new country, everything will

487
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,720
be different for you.

488
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,800
You'll meet a lot of new people.

489
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,200
I'll be here doing all the same things.

490
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:09,150
Do you think we'll feel the same about each
other in a year's time?'

491
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:17,040
Huw pulled back and looked deep into her eyes,
'I will, Megan,' he said.

492
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,780
'I know I'll never change.'

493
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:27,440
They kissed one last time and then she watched
as he disappeared.

494
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:37,610
The minute he was gone, Megan felt that a
part of her had died.

495
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,891
PART TWO
Fifty years later

496
00:41:40,891 --> 00:41:49,400
CHAPTER SIX
A surprise find

497
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,060
Tredonald 1996

498
00:41:52,060 --> 00:42:01,260
Megan and her daughter, Beth, sat in the front
room of Megan's home.

499
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:08,251
They were going through some old boxes full
of cards, old newspapers, photographs and

500
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:10,030
letters.

501
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:14,690
'Well!' said Beth, looking up from her box.

502
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:20,030
'I can't believe Grandma and Grandpa kept
all these things!'

503
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,690
'I know,' said Megan.

504
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:31,120
Her parents had died some years ago and she
had found all these boxes in their bedroom.

505
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,180
But until now she had never really looked
through them.

506
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:42,020
'Well,' she continued, 'only one box left.'

507
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:48,540
I have to go now, actually,' said Beth looking
at her watch.

508
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:54,100
'Philip's expecting me home by five,' Philip
was Beth's husband.

509
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,180
'You go then, dear.

510
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:03,130
I don't want to stop until I've finished everything
up here,' Megan said.

511
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:09,440
I'll ring you this evening, Mum,' said Beth.

512
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,890
'Don't do too much and make yourself tired.'

513
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,280
'I won't.

514
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,520
Thanks for your help earlier,' said Megan.

515
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:24,700
She heard her daughter close the front door.

516
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,240
Megan wanted to finish.

517
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,240
She wanted to ring Paul and tell him how well
she had done that day.

518
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:39,420
They were getting married in two months and
she was moving into his house in London.

519
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:45,250
It was quite a big house, but it was already
full of his things.

520
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:50,420
She couldn't take all her parents' things
with her as well as her own.

521
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,430
She had to throw away a lot.

522
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:57,750
Megan pulled the last box towards her.

523
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,730
She looked inside.

524
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:02,710
More letters.

525
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:08,840
She took out a few and looked at the envelopes.

526
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,700
She couldn't believe what she saw.

527
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:21,190
They were all addressed to her and they were
all from Canada.

528
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:24,600
And none of them had been opened.

529
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,280
She looked at the dates - 1946 and 1947.

530
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:37,650
'Oh, my God,' she said.

531
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,120
'Huw!'

532
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:49,260
Her hands were shaking as she started to read
one of the letters, dated August 1946.

533
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,260
My lovely Megan

534
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:56,060
I still haven't received a letter from you.

535
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:01,600
I can't believe it takes four months for letters
to cross the Atlantic.

536
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,690
What's happened'?

537
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:07,950
Is something wrong?

538
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:13,480
Megan sat for hours reading every letter.

539
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:22,520
At the end she felt completely empty and tired
and her heart was full of pain.

540
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:30,420
She remembered all the love that she and Huw
had felt for each other when they were young.

541
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:37,490
But more than that, she remembered how terribly
hurt she had been when no letters had arrived

542
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:39,560
from him.

543
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,770
She had spent many nights crying in her room.

544
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:49,240
Now she realised what her father had done.

545
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:54,360
He had hidden the letters and watched her
unhappiness.

546
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:01,170
She knew that her father had thought Huw was
not good enough for her, but she never realised

547
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:05,480
he'd been so much against him.

548
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,610
Megan took the letters downstairs.

549
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:17,200
She sat with them beside her, drank a large
whisky and then wrote a letter to Huw.

550
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,250
She had no idea if he would ever receive it.

551
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:28,700
'He won't be at the same address after fifty
years - he might even be dead,' she thought

552
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,930
to herself.

553
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:35,370
But she knew she had to write.

554
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:36,370
* * *

555
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:40,340
Toronto 1996

556
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:46,990
'Dad, letter for you,' shouted Mike Thomas.

557
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:51,410
His father was working in his painting studio
at the top of the house.

558
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:58,560
'OK, Mike, I'll be down in a minute,' said
his father, Huw.

559
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:03,600
Mike put the letter on the kitchen table,
and went back into the garden.

560
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:10,040
It was June and the weather was hot, but there
was a light wind.

561
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:18,210
'Where's the letter then?' asked Huw Thomas,
standing at the door and holding two cans

562
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,600
of beer.

563
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:25,020
'On the table,' replied his son, taking one
of the beers.

564
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:31,080
Huw picked up the letter and read the postmark
'Tredonald'.

565
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,710
'Wales!' said Huw in surprise.

566
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:42,090
'Who's writing to me from there?

567
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:46,440
It's years since I had any news from back
home.'

568
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:56,400
Huw still talked about Wales as 'home', although
he had lived in Toronto all his adult life.

569
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:07,310
He saw that the letter was addressed to Huw
Thomas, 2300 Ontario Drive, Toronto.

570
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:13,060
That was where he and his father had lived
in their early years in Toronto.

571
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:18,690
Someone there had discovered where he was
living now and had re- addressed the letter.

572
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,060
So who was writing to him?

573
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:27,560
He turned the envelope over in his hands several
times.

574
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,490
Then he took out the letter and read:

575
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,730
Dear Huw

576
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:38,600
I don't know if this letter will reach you,
and I don't really know why I'm writing to

577
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:42,050
you after all these years but...

578
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:46,810
Huw turned to the end of the letter and saw:

579
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,410
With best wishes

580
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,180
Megan

581
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,970
He couldn't believe it.

582
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:57,710
He turned back to the first words of the letter
and read:

583
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:06,220
...after all these years but I've just found
your letters to me from Canada, when you first

584
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,420
got there.

585
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:17,880
Believe me, this was the first time I'd read
them and they made me cry, even after fifty

586
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,880
years.

587
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,420
I found them in a box of my father's papers.

588
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,670
They were unopened.

589
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:31,030
Huw, I never knew that you'd written to me.

590
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:35,860
I thought your new life in Canada had made
you forget me.

591
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:40,470
Now I realise that my father kept your letters.

592
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:48,490
I can still remember asking him if there was
any post for me and he always said, 'No, he's

593
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,540
forgotten you, my girl.

594
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,430
I told you he was no good.'

595
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:59,590
Finally, after about a year, I believed him.

596
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:03,060
But why did he keep the letters?

597
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:08,260
Do you think he waited me to find them when
it was too late?

598
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:14,820
Anyway, he's dead now so I can't ask him.

599
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,461
All I can say is I'm sorry.

600
00:50:17,461 --> 00:50:31,430
Sorry for what my father did, sorry that you
never heard from me, and sorry for... everything.

601
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:35,870
I hope that at least this letter reaches you.

602
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:43,600
Of course, I'll understand if you don't want
to write back to me, but if you do, I am still

603
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:50,660
Megan Jenkins and I still live at the same
address in Tredonald.

604
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,660
Best wishes

605
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,660
Megan

606
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:59,510
Huw read the letter again.

607
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:03,740
Megan and their time together in Tredonald
came back to him.

608
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,150
He had never forgotten her.

609
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,360
He couldn't.

610
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,990
Every day he looked at her face on the wall
of his studio.

611
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:17,970
He had a drawing of her which he'd done when
they were sixteen.

612
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:21,760
It had travelled everywhere with him.

613
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,980
But to hear from her again...

614
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:31,390
'Are you all right, Dad?' asked Mike, coming
into the room.

615
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:39,470
'I've just heard from someone I knew a long
time ago,' Huw replied.

616
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:45,830
'Is it someone you knew back in Wales?'

617
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,280
'Yeah.

618
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,000
I can't believe it really.'

619
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:57,150
Huw explained about Megan and their young
love and what he had thought when there were

620
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:00,510
no replies to his letters.

621
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:03,790
He tried to keep his voice light.

622
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:08,800
Mike didn't need to know how deeply they had
loved each other.

623
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:15,700
'Her father sounds terrible,' Mike said when
his father had finished.

624
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,610
'Not really.

625
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:25,660
He just wanted the best for his daughter,
and he didn't think I was the best,' replied

626
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,660
Huw.

627
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:34,790
'And he never read my letters so he didn't
know I was doing well over here,'

628
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:41,990
'Did Mum know anything about this Megan?'
asked Mike carefully.

629
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:47,870
'I told her that there had been someone else
at home, but...

630
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:52,530
I mean, I didn't meet your mother until...

631
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:57,280
what... ten years after I'd left Wales.

632
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:03,300
So Megan was part of my past - part of another
life.'

633
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:12,190
Huw stood up and looked out of the kitchen
window across the garden, thinking about Megan

634
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:17,250
- and his ex-wife, Josie.

635
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:23,710
He and Josie were married for twelve years
before they got divorced.

636
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:31,600
They said it was because there were too many
differences between them, but Huw knew that

637
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,640
Megan was part of the problem.

638
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,910
Josie always thought he loved Megan more than
her.

639
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:47,610
So what he had just said to Mike wasn't really
true.

640
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:53,930
Megan had not been only in Huw's past.

641
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,690
Mike came and stood next to him.

642
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:01,080
'Are you going to write back to her?'

643
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:06,950
'I don't know,' replied Huw slowly.

644
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:13,070
'I need time to think about it all.

645
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:16,190
It's all so sudden.'

646
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:21,480
Huw took the letter and went back upstairs
to his studio.

647
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,440
He did no painting for the rest of the afternoon.

648
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,770
He just sat looking out of the window.

649
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:33,830
CHAPTER SEVEN
Time to decide

650
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:41,310
Megan's letter had turned Huw's world upside
down.

651
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:46,350
In the days after he received it, he went
for long walks by himself.

652
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:53,700
His head was full of things that had happened
to him over the last fifty years.

653
00:54:53,700 --> 00:55:01,740
He remembered how alone he had felt when no
letters had arrived from Megan all those years

654
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,540
ago.

655
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:12,690
At the end of his second year in Toronto,
he had had enough money to go back to Wales,

656
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:15,290
but he hadn't gone.

657
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:22,470
He believed that Megan no longer loved him
and had forgotten him, so he tried to do the

658
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:25,990
same - forget her.

659
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:32,240
Both Huw and his father had worked hard in
their new country.

660
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:40,970
They had found work in a factory that made
cars and David Thomas had stopped drinking.

661
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,240
He'd married again and been happy.

662
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:52,990
The Canadian years had been good for his father
until he'd died eighteen years ago.

663
00:55:52,990 --> 00:56:01,410
Now Huw was a well-known artist and people
paid thousands of dollars for his art.

664
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:08,780
Two months ago, Time magazine had even written
about him and his latest paintings.

665
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:12,550
His love life, however, had not been so great.

666
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:20,550
Since his divorce from Josie, there had been
other women in his life, but as he got older

667
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:24,040
these friendships seemed less important.

668
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:32,300
His life was full and interesting in other
ways - painting, of course, fishing and walking

669
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,510
in the forests and mountains.

670
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:39,470
He was happy that Mike and his family were
sharing his house.

671
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:45,130
He had more than enough money to do what he
wanted.

672
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:52,410
But now Megan had come back into his life.

673
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:58,290
On one of his many walks, he read Megan's
letter for the twentieth time.

674
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:02,510
She said she was still Megan Jenkins.

675
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:09,700
'So,' Huw thought, 'she never got married.'

676
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:17,170
He remembered her as a warm, loving and intelligent
person and thought it was sad that she had

677
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:21,190
never shared all this with a man.

678
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,440
Then he laughed at himself.

679
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,970
'Maybe she was happy to be single,' he thought.

680
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:36,510
'Or maybe she was married and something happened
and she changed her name back to Jenkins.

681
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:40,340
What does it matter?

682
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:43,980
It's all in the past now.'

683
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:50,550
When he arrived back home that evening he
told his family that he had made a decision:

684
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:55,010
he was not going to write back to Megan.

685
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,300
His life was here now.

686
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:02,160
Better to let the past stay in the past.

687
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:12,420
Later in the evening, Huw went back upstairs
to his studio and, for some reason, started

688
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,890
looking through some of his early work.

689
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:22,500
There were paintings and drawings of his that
he hadn't looked at for years.

690
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:27,480
He found some drawings he'd done in the first
few months after he'd arrived in Toronto.

691
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,890
Most of them were of ships.

692
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:39,350
He remembered he used to think about getting
on one of the ships and sailing away.

693
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:46,920
Sometimes he had wanted to sail back to Wales
and Megan, and then later he'd just wanted

694
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,490
to escape to anywhere.

695
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:55,590
He spent the next few hours lost in his thoughts.

696
00:58:55,590 --> 00:59:02,230
It was five o'clock in the morning when he
looked at his watch and slowly went to bed,

697
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:06,910
his head still full of the past.

698
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:13,610
CHAPTER EIGHT
Telling Beth

699
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:18,130
On Saturday, Megan drove out of Tredonald
towards Cardiff.

700
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:22,970
She was on her way to Beth's house for lunch.

701
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:30,280
Her thoughts, however, were not really on
the road but on the letters and Huw.

702
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:37,180
She didn't know if she'd done the right thing
writing to Huw.

703
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:42,690
Was it brave or was it just stupid?

704
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:45,610
And what was she going to say to Beth today?

705
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:48,110
And what about Paul?

706
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:53,800
Did she need to tell him about the letters,
too?

707
00:59:53,800 --> 01:00:00,080
Of course they'd talked about Huw, but it
was different now.

708
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:08,010
Huw was no longer safely in the past: he was
once again very much part of the present.

709
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:14,640
But Paul was her present - and her future.

710
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:21,040
At the age of sixty-six, and for the second
time in her life, she was making plans to

711
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,860
get married.

712
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:31,010
She'd met Paul Henderson some years ago through
her work for the Welsh Tourist Office and

713
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:32,950
they'd become good friends.

714
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:40,090
Neither of them were working now so they were
able to go on holiday together.

715
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:48,330
Paul had taken her to places like Japan and
Peru - places she'd always wanted to visit.

716
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:53,960
And slowly the friendship had developed into
something more.

717
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,700
Megan stopped the car outside Beth's house.

718
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:02,160
Beth was in the front garden, waiting for
her.

719
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,030
'Morning, Mum,' she said, giving her mother
a kiss.

720
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,390
'Journey OK?'

721
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:11,750
'Yes, fine.

722
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:16,930
It's much quicker now they've opened that
new bit of road, isn't it?'

723
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:20,770
Megan followed her daughter into the house.

724
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:22,390
'Where's Philip?'

725
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,920
'Playing golf,' replied Beth.

726
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:29,130
'He'll be back this afternoon.'

727
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:30,340
Megan was pleased.

728
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:36,690
She loved her son-in-law but what she had
to say was for Beth.

729
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:40,690
It would be easier to talk to her alone.

730
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:49,300
After they'd finished eating, Megan took some
of Huw's letters from her handbag and put

731
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,310
them on the table.

732
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:56,520
'I found these the other day,' she said.

733
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:01,080
'You know, in that last box.

734
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,500
After you'd gone home.'

735
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:09,740
'Who are they from?' asked Beth as she passed
her mother a cup of coffee.

736
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:14,310
'Well, that's just it...'

737
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,370
Megan stopped.

738
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:21,110
She knew that this moment was important for
Beth.

739
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:25,030
'They're from Huw...

740
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:27,610
Huw Thomas...

741
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,240
your father.'

742
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,490
'My father!

743
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:35,740
Good God!'

744
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:42,350
Beth looked at the envelopes on the table
and then looked at her mother.

745
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:47,610
She'd always known about her father - her
mother had told her everything when she was

746
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,440
young.

747
01:02:49,440 --> 01:03:01,620
But for years she'd never thought about him
- Huw Thomas was just a name, not a person.

748
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:05,640
'Here,' said Megan, giving Beth one of the
letters.

749
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,860
'You can read this one.'

750
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,340
Beth read it quickly.

751
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,980
'How many more letters are there?'

752
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:16,530
she asked.

753
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,070
About fifty.

754
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:22,230
They stopped in 1947,' said Megan quietly.

755
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:25,640
'He didn't write after that.'

756
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:29,410
'So you never knew anything about them...

757
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:34,790
That means grandpa or grandma just hid them
from you and...'

758
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:37,540
'Yes, it was my father, I'm sure.

759
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:42,150
I don't think my mother knew about them either.

760
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:45,950
It was my father who was so against Huw.'

761
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:54,240
'But you were going to have a baby, you were
expecting me.

762
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,180
Huw was my father.

763
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,380
How could he?'

764
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:02,250
Beth was lost for words.

765
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:05,040
'I know, Beth.

766
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:09,200
It's difficult to understand.

767
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:16,060
All I can say is my father was doing what
he thought was right for me.

768
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,980
He wasn't a terrible person.'

769
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:23,200
'I know,' said Beth.

770
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,590
'I loved him.

771
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:29,080
He was great to me when I was little.

772
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,140
That's why it's so hard to believe.'

773
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:38,640
'My father always wanted me to do well in
life,' said Megan, trying to explain.

774
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:46,270
'He wanted me to go to college and be better
than the other young people in the village.

775
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:52,600
He never thought Huw was good enough for me
and he clearly thought I would have a better

776
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,000
life without him.'

777
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:01,130
'But that was your decision to make, not his,'
said Beth.

778
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:08,440
'Remember, I was only seventeen - still a
child in his eyes.

779
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,260
Maybe he was right.

780
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:18,880
I mean, they looked after you when you were
a baby and I was able to go to college.'

781
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,470
Megan turned to her daughter.

782
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:25,230
'And we had a good life together, didn't we?

783
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:28,850
We made a happy family.'

784
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:37,500
'Yes, Mum, it's OK,' said Beth putting her
arm round her mother.

785
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,160
'And what about you?

786
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:44,320
How do you feel about it all now?'

787
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:49,730
'I've written a letter to Huw, but it probably
won't reach him.

788
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:56,450
I just felt I had to say something - better
late than never.'

789
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:59,090
Megan laughed sadly.

790
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:04,360
'Did you tell him about me?'

791
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,120
Beth asked.

792
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:12,030
'No, I thought we should wait until...

793
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:16,180
if... he writes back.

794
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,960
I hope he does write back.

795
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,060
I want to know about his life.

796
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:25,040
Was I wrong not to tell him, do you think?'

797
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:32,060
'I want him to know about me, if he's still
alive,' replied Beth.

798
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,010
'Yes, I understand,' said Megan.

799
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:43,870
'To tell you the truth, Beth, it's brought
back a lot of old feelings.

800
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:48,510
We were very much in love, even though we
were so young.'

801
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:51,750
'I remember you used to talk about him.

802
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:58,730
And he always seemed so wonderful to me as
a child.'

803
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:03,100
Neither of the women said anything for a few
minutes.

804
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:09,080
Then Beth asked, 'And are you going to tell
Paul about all this?'

805
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,150
'Yes, of course.

806
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:16,150
But it doesn't change anything,' said Megan.

807
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:21,020
'I'm still going to marry Paul.'

808
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,230
CHAPTER NINE
A second letter

809
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:29,920
Huw got another surprise when a second short
letter arrived from Wales.

810
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,430
Dear Mr Thomas

811
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:39,270
I know that my mother, Megan Jenkins, wrote
to you two weeks ago.

812
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:40,310
I hope you got that letter.

813
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:46,290
For some reason, I think you did.

814
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:47,660
'Ah!

815
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:52,490
So she did get married,' thought Huw.

816
01:07:52,490 --> 01:08:00,050
She told me about your letters that she'd
found, and I've talked a lot about you.

817
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:06,460
But there was something in her letter that
she didn't say.

818
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:14,740
It's quite easy for me to write, but probably
not easy for you to read.

819
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:18,000
I am your daughter.

820
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:28,380
I was born on November 14th, 1946, seven months
after you left Tredonald.

821
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:37,960
So you can see - if you get this letter - that
both of us really would like to hear from

822
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,359
you.

823
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,750
With best wishes

824
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:43,750
Beth Jones

825
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,440
Good God!

826
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,460
Was it true?

827
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:53,500
Did he have a daughter?

828
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:59,779
It could be true - the dates were right.

829
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:06,100
He remembered the one and only time that he
and Megan had made love.

830
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:11,965
It was quite soon after Gareth's death down
the coal mine, and they'd been alone in her

831
01:09:11,965 --> 01:09:14,000
parents' flat for the first time.

832
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:22,400
'I'm sorry, Megan,' said Huw, talking to his
drawing of her.

833
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,290
'Did you hate me for what happened?'

834
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:29,900
He had to write back to Megan.

835
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:34,060
They had a daughter!

836
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,200
How strange that sounded!

837
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,600
What was she like?

838
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:45,850
There was nothing in Beth's letter to help
him get any idea of her.

839
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:52,920
He wanted to meet her, but would she want
to meet him?

840
01:09:52,920 --> 01:10:02,070
It'd be very difficult for all three of them
- there was fifty years of nothing between

841
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:03,070
them.

842
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:11,850
That night Huw told Mike and Mike's wife,
Rebecca, about the letter.

843
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:16,540
Neither of them really knew what to say.

844
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:22,440
Mike found it hard to understand that his
father had a daughter, a daughter his father

845
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,110
had never known about.

846
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:28,090
To Rebecca it all seemed unreal.

847
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:32,780
'Wait a minute, Huw,' she said.

848
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:40,550
'Someone writes to you saying she's your daughter
and you believe her?

849
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:43,620
How do you know for sure?'

850
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:47,990
'It's true,' said Huw slowly.

851
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:54,120
'In my heart, I know it's true.'

852
01:10:54,120 --> 01:11:06,250
He looked at Mike and Rebecca and said, 'Anyway,
I've decided I am going to write back to Megan.

853
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:11,700
We'll see what she says.'

854
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,030
CHAPTER TEN
Writing back

855
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:20,230
Two weeks later, it was Megan's turn to receive
a letter.

856
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:28,330
When she saw it lying on the floor by the
front door, her heart jumped.

857
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:31,160
She knew it was from Huw.

858
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:36,520
She sat with a cup of coffee, looking at the
envelope.

859
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:40,540
Finally, she opened it.

860
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,440
Some photographs fell out.

861
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:48,210
And there he was - smiling at her.

862
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:54,700
She smiled back at him, her eyes full of tears.

863
01:11:54,700 --> 01:12:01,130
My dearest Megan - after fifty years it's
good to say that again.

864
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:07,810
Thank you for writing to me, but why didn't
you tell me about Beth?

865
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:13,270
No, I don't think I need to ask that question.

866
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:21,500
As I'm sure you know, she wrote and explained
everything.

867
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:26,630
I think it's wonderful that we have a daughter.

868
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:33,880
But, Megan, I wish... so many things!

869
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:38,150
I'm trying to picture your life with a baby.

870
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:41,480
Did you marry?

871
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,980
Did Beth grow up with a father?

872
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:51,120
How much did you hate me all those years for
leaving you alone?

873
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:58,110
I need to know more than letters and photographs
can tell me.

874
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:04,730
Would it be all right if I came to Tredonald
to see you and Beth?

875
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:09,520
I want the three of us to get to know each
other.

876
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:16,460
I'm sending you some photographs of me and
my family.

877
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:23,540
I have a son, Mike, and two lovely grandchildren...

878
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:26,650
Megan read to the end of the letter.

879
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:32,010
Beth had told her about writing to Huw, so
that wasn't a surprise.

880
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:42,580
But to actually read his words and see his
face again - it was almost too much for her.

881
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:47,560
It was time for Megan to speak to Beth.

882
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,200
They had to make a decision together.

883
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:59,860
Did they want Huw back in their lives, or
should they continue as before - just the

884
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:02,470
two of them.

885
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:07,700
And then there was Paul to consider.

886
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:12,440
Huw waited impatiently for an answer from
Megan.

887
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:17,940
In his head, he had many wonderful conversations
with the two of them.

888
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:23,900
But he knew that it was not going to be that
easy.

889
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:34,750
Then soon after his letter to Megan, he received
a reply - just a short letter with a photograph

890
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,480
of two women.

891
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:42,510
'My God!' he said quietly, talking to her
photo.

892
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:45,060
'Just look at you!

893
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:48,260
You're still my lovely Megan.

894
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:50,680
And this is our daughter, is it?

895
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:56,950
Yes it is, I can see it is.'

896
01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:03,800
He then turned to the letter and read it through
until he reached the final two lines:

897
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:16,730
PS Here's a photo of Beth and me which was
taken in the sitting room above the shop.

898
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:17,730
Remember?

899
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:18,730
Remember?

900
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:26,270
How could he forget - they had loved each
other in that same room fifty years before.

901
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:32,710
He remembered the feel of her soft lips and
the smell of her dark hair.

902
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:36,890
He looked back at the photograph.

903
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:42,540
The two women were sitting on a sofa together
and holding hands, both of them looking at

904
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:44,930
the camera and smiling.

905
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:51,710
Huw stood in front of the studio window and
cried.

906
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:58,230
So many years had passed and so much time
lost.

907
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:05,810
Seeing how close Megan and her daughter were,
it was painful to think that he had not been

908
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:08,310
a part of it.

909
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:11,320
He turned the photograph over.

910
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:19,020
On the back was the date and the words, 'Beth
and I would like to meet you.'

911
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:25,400
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Home to Wales

912
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:32,990
Huw, Mike and Rebecca were sitting in the
garden of their house, drinking wine on a

913
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:35,590
warm evening.

914
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:43,860
'So that's my half-sister, is it?' asked Mike,
looking closely at the photo.

915
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:48,450
'Let's see,' said Rebecca.

916
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:50,750
'Oh yes!

917
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,550
Look at her nose, Mike.

918
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:55,610
It's just like yours!'

919
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:59,440
'Rubbish!' said Mike.

920
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:03,130
He turned the photo over and read the message.

921
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:08,470
'Are you going over to see them, Dad?'

922
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:11,670
'Yes, I think so.

923
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:15,670
Is that OK with you?'

924
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:22,730
'It's a big step, but how can you not go and
see your daughter?'

925
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:23,950
replied Mike.

926
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:29,420
'You'd never be able to live with yourself.'

927
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:32,900
And Megan, too,' said Huw.

928
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:37,420
'I do want to see her again.'

929
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:44,080
'Hey, how about this for an idea?' said Mike
suddenly.

930
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,170
'I'll come with you.

931
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:51,330
I'd be really interested to see Tredonald.

932
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:55,850
It's part of our family's life, isn't it?

933
01:17:55,850 --> 01:18:00,040
You and grandpa never really talked much about
the place.

934
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:05,590
You just used to say that Toronto was much
better.'

935
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:10,220
'Yes, I know,' said Huw with a laugh.

936
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:14,240
'We arrived just after the war in Europe.

937
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,560
Life was very difficult in Wales when we left.'

938
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,050
'How about it then?

939
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:22,720
You and me,' said Mike.

940
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:29,180
He was getting quite interested in the idea
of travelling with his father.

941
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:35,770
'Another time, Mike,' said Huw quietly.

942
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:41,260
'This time is for me.

943
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:42,350
OK?'

944
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:49,520
'OK,' said Mike, and then added, 'as long
as you don't decide to stay in Wales.'

945
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,080
'Don't worry,' said Huw.

946
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,930
'I'm not going to stay there.

947
01:18:55,930 --> 01:19:01,770
My home is in Canada, my work is here, you're
here.

948
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,410
I'll be back.'

949
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:05,410
* * *

950
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:09,070
So at the end of the month, Huw flew to London.

951
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:18,480
He'd written to Megan, and to Beth, to say
that he was coming, but hadn't said which

952
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,190
day.

953
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:27,280
He'd decided not to, then he could change
his mind at the last minute if he wanted to.

954
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:31,440
But now the plane was about to land.

955
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:37,650
His hire car was waiting for him outside the
airport.

956
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:43,710
He had slept well on the plane so he was able
to keep a clear head for driving.

957
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:53,650
And he needed it - driving on the left was
not easy!

958
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:57,490
The nearer he got to Tredonald, the more unsure
he became.

959
01:19:57,490 --> 01:20:04,150
He realised that he was afraid of what might
happen.

960
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:13,830
Half of him was afraid that he wouldn't like
Megan, or Beth, and the other half of him

961
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:16,980
was afraid he would like them too much.

962
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:24,550
He was a man who liked to know what he was
doing and why.

963
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:32,860
Before he'd received Megan's first letter,
his life had been well organised, but now

964
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:42,520
it was different - he felt like a sixteen-year-old
again.

965
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:48,880
It was not just Megan and Beth - it was also
Tredonald.

966
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:57,270
He and his father had left it so long ago
and at a really bad time in their lives.

967
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:03,190
He had no idea how he was going to feel when
he saw the place again.

968
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:09,100
Just outside Tredonald, he stopped at a pub.

969
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:12,280
He needed a drink.

970
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:15,510
The barman put a glass in front of him.

971
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:20,630
'Are you here on holiday?' he asked,

972
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:23,370
'Sort of,' replied Huw.

973
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:26,750
'We don't get many people here on holiday.

974
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:31,780
There's nothing to do here, nothing to see
really.'

975
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:36,610
'I used to live here many years ago,' said
Huw.

976
01:21:36,610 --> 01:21:41,270
'Did you now?'

977
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:45,320
The barman looked a bit more interested.

978
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:49,470
'You'll see some changes then.'

979
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:53,831
'Mmm,' said Huw, trying to enjoy his rather
warm beer.

980
01:21:53,831 --> 01:21:55,170
'What about the mine in Tredonald?

981
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:59,650
Is it still working?'

982
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:07,480
'No, it closed about fifteen years ago.

983
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:14,000
Well, it's still open but only for tourists,
not for coal.'

984
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:19,010
But Huw didn't want to talk any more.

985
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:24,520
'Is there a public phone I can use?' he asked.

986
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:30,590
'Through there,' said the barman showing him
a door to the left of the bar.

987
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:34,360
Huw went through it.

988
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:38,930
He picked up the phone and rang Megan's number.

989
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:45,220
CHAPTER TWELVE
A new start

990
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:48,430
'Oh damn!' said Megan.

991
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:53,610
'Why does the phone always ring when I've
just sat down?

992
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:54,610
Hello?'

993
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:58,560
'Hello, this is Huw.

994
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,530
Is that Megan?'

995
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:02,530
'Huw!

996
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:05,490
Where are you?

997
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:09,210
You sound so close!'

998
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:10,590
Megan began to shake.

999
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:18,680
'I'm in the Rose and Crown, just outside Tredonald,'
said Huw.

1000
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:22,360
'Oh, Huw, why didn't you...'

1001
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,420
And then she couldn't continue.

1002
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:29,080
Neither of them spoke for a few seconds.

1003
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:35,400
Neither could quite believe they were so close
to the person they'd lost fifty years ago.

1004
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:42,270
When Megan finally said something, her voice
was lull of tears.

1005
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:49,480
'Let's meet in the Tredonald Arms Hotel.

1006
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,690
It's on Bridge Street.

1007
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:55,460
Do you remember it?'

1008
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:59,190
'No, but I'll find it.

1009
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:04,440
See you there in half an hour?'

1010
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:10,640
'No, I need a bit more time,' said Megan.

1011
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:15,450
She wanted some time to get herself and her
thoughts together.

1012
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:20,450
'Let's meet a bit later...

1013
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:23,450
say seven o'clock?'

1014
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:26,450
'Fine,' replied Huw.

1015
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:31,170
'And Megan... it's good to hear your voice.

1016
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:38,150
I can't really believe I'm talking to you
again.'

1017
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:45,490
From the moment Megan had answered the phone,
Huw had felt sure again.

1018
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:52,590
He wasn't worried about how the meeting would
be - he was just impatient to see her.

1019
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:59,560
'I know, Huw,' said Megan quietly.

1020
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,330
'I'm happy you're here.'

1021
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:08,580
As soon as she finished talking to Huw, Megan
rang Beth.

1022
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:15,830
'He's arrived,' she said, knowing she didn't
need to say who had arrived.

1023
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:16,880
'And?

1024
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:23,180
Have you seen him?' asked Beth.

1025
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:26,080
Megan didn't reply immediately.

1026
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:30,680
Are you all right, Mum?'

1027
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:37,230
'Yes, sorry dear, I'm meeting him at seven.

1028
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:40,790
But I don't feel very brave.

1029
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:45,090
I think I'm sorry I wrote to him.

1030
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:46,210
I mean...

1031
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:49,980
what are we going to talk about?

1032
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:55,980
Oh Beth, it's all too much for me!'

1033
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,480
'Don't worry, Mum,' said Beth.

1034
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:02,080
'I'm sure it'll be fine.

1035
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:05,820
Just take it as it comes.

1036
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:07,700
Ring me later.

1037
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:14,060
And remember, I love you.'

1038
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:20,100
At seven o'clock that evening, Megan walked
into the Tredonald Arms Hotel.

1039
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:28,800
Huw was sitting in a big armchair, opposite
the front entrance where he could watch everybody

1040
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,800
who came in.

1041
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:33,660
They saw each other immediately.

1042
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:44,920
What he saw was a slim woman with grey hair
and a strong face.

1043
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:52,300
What she saw was a tall, handsome man whose
face was brown from the sun.

1044
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:59,840
They shook hands, and then he kissed her on
both cheeks.

1045
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:07,050
They both stood looking at each other for
a few moments without saying anything.

1046
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:11,660
Then Megan sat down in the soft armchair.

1047
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:19,090
For the next two hours, they talked.

1048
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:30,670
At first, the conversation had been a bit
difficult with lots of 'I can't believe it!'

1049
01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:34,660
and 'Is it really you?' and 'After all these
years'.

1050
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:38,680
But slowly they began to talk as old friends.

1051
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:48,320
It was easy to talk about their homes, work,
Tredonald and Toronto.

1052
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:54,260
But it was more difficult to find the right
words when they talked about Beth.

1053
01:27:54,260 --> 01:28:01,980
'Megan, tell me about Beth, our daughter.

1054
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:06,140
I want to know everything,' said Huw.

1055
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:16,690
'I don't think of her as our daughter, I'm
afraid,' replied Megan carefully.

1056
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:22,880
'I've been her only parent all her life.

1057
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:32,000
Of course I've talked to her about you, but
you've never been a real person for her.'

1058
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,870
'I'm sorry,' said Huw quickly.

1059
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:38,960
'I didn't mean to...

1060
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,050
You're right, of course.

1061
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:46,800
But I want to know all about her.'

1062
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:51,610
'Well,' replied Megan in a more friendly voice.

1063
01:28:51,610 --> 01:29:01,850
'She lives in Cardiff, she's married with
three grown-up children, so you have three

1064
01:29:01,850 --> 01:29:03,850
grandchildren as well.'

1065
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:05,850
'That makes five.

1066
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:12,020
My son Mike has two - David and Amy.'

1067
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:15,100
Megan nodded and continued.

1068
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:21,780
'She and her husband have their own business
- they're architects.

1069
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:25,510
Beth was always interested in drawing'.

1070
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:34,510
'Like me,' said Huw, pleased that he shared
something with his daughter.

1071
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:36,540
Then he became more serious.

1072
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:41,140
'Your father really hated me, didn't he?

1073
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:48,140
He preferred to let you be an unmarried mother
rather than marry me.'

1074
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:52,220
Huw felt himself getting angry.

1075
01:29:52,220 --> 01:30:02,480
'I don't think he hated you - it was more
that he really loved me, or maybe his ideas

1076
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:06,020
for me,' replied Megan.

1077
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:10,990
'Was it hard for you when she was born?'

1078
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:18,640
'Yes and no,' replied Megan, sitting back
in her chair.

1079
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:30,070
'When I told my parents I was pregnant, they
were angry... sad, hurt... everything.

1080
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:35,560
My father had big plans for me - do you remember?

1081
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:44,550
After I had Beth, I went to college and became
a teacher, and he and my mother looked after

1082
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:45,550
Beth.

1083
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:48,140
They were wonderful, really.

1084
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:54,370
They loved her and she had a happy time as
a child.

1085
01:30:54,370 --> 01:31:01,570
It was only when she used to ask about her
daddy that the conversation went cold.

1086
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:05,590
But she soon learnt.

1087
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:13,130
Her daddy was somebody she asked me about,
not her grandparents.'

1088
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:18,630
A little bit of sadness had come into Megan's
voice.

1089
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:25,190
Huw took her hand and, for a few seconds,
she didn't realise.

1090
01:31:25,190 --> 01:31:31,110
Then she gave a smile and took her hand away.

1091
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:35,770
Anyway, now it's your turn.

1092
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:39,360
I want to know more about you.

1093
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:43,430
You've done very well with your art, haven't
you?

1094
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:45,250
I'm so pleased.'

1095
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:53,540
She was able to look at him as he talked about
his work and she could see the same Huw that

1096
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:57,550
she'd known all those years ago.

1097
01:31:57,550 --> 01:32:04,870
She wanted to reach across and touch him,
to reach across fifty years...

1098
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:07,020
But how could she?

1099
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:13,770
It was a fine evening so they went for a short
walk.

1100
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:17,820
Huw needed some fresh air.

1101
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:24,340
He felt tired after his long journey from
Toronto, but he didn't want to say goodnight

1102
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:25,570
to Megan.

1103
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:28,930
They stood looking down at the river.

1104
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:35,800
'We used to spend a lot of time walking by
this river, didn't we?' said Huw.

1105
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,490
'Do you remember?'

1106
01:32:37,490 --> 01:32:44,230
'Yes, we did,' laughed Megan.

1107
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:49,280
'Well, we didn't have many places.

1108
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:55,900
It was either here or up on the hill, wasn't
it?'

1109
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:57,880
'True,' said Huw.

1110
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:58,880
'And the cinema.

1111
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,340
We went there the night Gareth was killed.

1112
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:09,370
'Yes, I remember it well,' replied Megan.

1113
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:11,940
I often think of Gareth.'

1114
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:13,020
'Really?

1115
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:18,410
Why's that?' asked Huw, surprised.

1116
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:26,810
'I sometimes take groups of visitors on tours
down the mine,' replied Megan.

1117
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:33,260
'The tour takes people past the entrance to
the tunnel where the roof fell.

1118
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:39,180
Gareth is always in my thoughts when we pass
it.'

1119
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:42,050
Huw turned towards her.

1120
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:49,660
'But why are you - I mean, when did you start
going down the mine?'

1121
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:54,700
'Oh, it's a long story,' said Megan.

1122
01:33:54,700 --> 01:34:03,570
'But when we knew that the mine was going
to close, I had the idea of trying to do something

1123
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:05,610
with it.

1124
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:09,880
I'd stopped teaching so I had the time.

1125
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:12,360
I don't go down very often now.

1126
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:15,840
Most of the tours are done by the older ex-miners.

1127
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:21,300
That was another reason for not letting it
die.

1128
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,530
There was nothing else for the men to do.

1129
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:29,020
Now at least some of them have jobs.'

1130
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:32,710
'Good for you,' said Huw.

1131
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:36,350
'You always were a fighter, weren't you?

1132
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:41,600
I think I'd like to go down again.

1133
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,270
Would you come with me?'

1134
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:46,340
'You don't need me.

1135
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:50,610
You know it better than I do,' said Megan.

1136
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:55,739
'I did, but not now.

1137
01:34:55,739 --> 01:34:57,570
Come with me.'

1138
01:34:57,570 --> 01:34:59,750
'OK,' said Megan.

1139
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:03,000
'If you really want to.'

1140
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:12,110
As they walked back towards the hotel, Megan
told him more about her work for the mine.

1141
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:17,930
She explained how difficult it had been to
get money to develop the mine so they could

1142
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:20,200
open it to tourists.

1143
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:29,390
'It took five years, and it was hard work
- but I met some interesting people, including

1144
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:39,740
a very dear person, Paul Henderson, who...
helped me a lot.'

1145
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:47,400
Megan had meant to say 'who I'm going to marry
next month', but she didn't.

1146
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:55,560
At least she'd introduced Paul's name into
the conversation: now she could talk about

1147
01:35:55,560 --> 01:36:03,880
him, and maybe the next time she met Huw she
would tell him she was going to get married.

1148
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:08,570
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Lunch with Beth

1149
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:13,430
Huw was working down the mine.

1150
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:20,600
Suddenly there was a loud noise and the roof
of the tunnel began to fall.

1151
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:27,320
He put his arms over his head, but the falling
rock knocked him to the ground.

1152
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:34,720
He could see Megan's hands reaching out to
him, but he couldn't quite touch them.

1153
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:39,820
Then more rock fell and all was black.

1154
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:44,300
He cried out and woke up.

1155
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:49,630
He sat up in bed and for a moment couldn't
remember where he was.

1156
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:57,700
He looked around and slowly realised that
this was his hotel room in Tredonald.

1157
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:03,020
He was safe, not down the mine.

1158
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:08,570
He lay down again, but couldn't go back to
sleep.

1159
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:12,950
It was five o'clock in the morning.

1160
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:20,320
He got up and sat by the window of his room
watching the darkness disappear and the sun

1161
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:23,130
rise.

1162
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:34,720
His head was full of thoughts - Megan, Gareth,
his father, Beth - and how life threw things

1163
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:38,460
at you when you were least expecting them.

1164
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:47,710
One thing was clear to him, however, and that
was how he felt about Megan.

1165
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:48,710
He loved her.

1166
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:59,780
Maybe not in the same way as he had when he
was seventeen, but he knew that she was still

1167
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:02,060
the only one for him.

1168
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:10,739
Being with her again felt right - it was like
coming home.

1169
01:38:10,739 --> 01:38:15,000
He wanted to be with her for the rest of his
life.

1170
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,500
He was sure about this.

1171
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:19,500
And Megan?

1172
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:24,410
What did she feel about him?

1173
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:28,780
In the next few days, he would find out.

1174
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:34,590
He got back into bed and fell into a deep
sleep.

1175
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:40,650
It was the sound of the telephone that woke
him.

1176
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:43,420
'Mr Thomas' said a voice.

1177
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:47,060
'There's a lady here in reception for you.'

1178
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:52,590
'Thank you,' said Huw, looking at the clock.

1179
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:57,910
'Tell her I'll be down soon.'

1180
01:38:57,910 --> 01:39:01,070
It was ten o'clock!

1181
01:39:01,070 --> 01:39:03,930
Megan was waiting for him.

1182
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:08,100
They were going to Cardiff to meet Beth.

1183
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:17,060
He had the fastest shower ever, got dressed
and was downstairs in the hotel reception

1184
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:19,140
in fifteen minutes.

1185
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:26,060
'Sorry, Megan,' he said, giving her a kiss
on the cheek.

1186
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,070
'I had a bad night.

1187
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:31,640
I was still asleep when the phone rang.'

1188
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:33,150
Megan smiled.

1189
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:37,670
'Would you like me to drive?

1190
01:39:37,670 --> 01:39:40,890
You can take it easy.'

1191
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:44,920
'Good idea,' replied Huw, returning her smile.

1192
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:51,970
He was happy to see her and to know that they
were going to spend the day together.

1193
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:59,630
As Huw opened the door of the car for Megan,
he saw that she was wearing a silver necklace.

1194
01:39:59,630 --> 01:40:03,730
'Megan, you've still got it!'

1195
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:10,270
'What?' said Megan, but her hand immediately
moved to touch the necklace.

1196
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:12,440
'Oh, the necklace.

1197
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,950
Yes, of course I've still got it.

1198
01:40:14,950 --> 01:40:16,130
I often wear it.'

1199
01:40:16,130 --> 01:40:21,920
Huw sat beside her as they drove out of Tredonald.

1200
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:28,640
She told him how important the necklace had
been to her in the early days.

1201
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:35,800
It was the only thing she had from him - except
for Beth, of course.

1202
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:43,400
Huw told her about the drawing he had of her
and how it went everywhere with him.

1203
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:48,550
Megan felt comfortable with Huw next to her.

1204
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:56,400
She, too, had not had a very good night's
sleep - too many things going round in her

1205
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:57,420
head.

1206
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:02,570
But today she felt better.

1207
01:41:02,570 --> 01:41:04,960
She started talking about Beth.

1208
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:12,000
She knew that Beth was a bit worried about
meeting her father for the first time, and

1209
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,210
she thought that Huw was probably feeling
the same.

1210
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:23,690
Megan and Huw entered the cafe where they
were meeting Beth.

1211
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:30,830
Huw's eyes searched left and right, looking
for the right face.

1212
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:37,420
A tall woman with dark hair stood up and walked
towards them.

1213
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:43,600
She put her arms round Megan and held her
for a moment.

1214
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:54,860
Then she looked at Huw, put out her hand and
said, 'Hello, I'm Beth.'

1215
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:55,860
'Hello, I'm...'

1216
01:41:55,860 --> 01:42:03,030
Huw stopped himself from saying 'I'm your
father' and said, 'I'm Huw.'

1217
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:08,160
He took both her hands in his.

1218
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:14,530
They looked long and hard at each other, searching
for something that showed they were father

1219
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:17,510
and daughter.

1220
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:18,510
Megan spoke.

1221
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:20,640
'Look, I'm going to do some shopping.

1222
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:27,330
I think it's better if you two talk without
me here.

1223
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:30,122
I'll be back in about an hour or so.'

1224
01:42:30,122 --> 01:42:39,100
And without giving either of them time to
say anything, she walked out of the cafe.

1225
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:46,760
From the moment Huw and Beth sat down, they
didn't stop talking.

1226
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:53,580
She told him about growing up in the flat
above the shop in Tredonald, about her life

1227
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:56,500
now, her kids, her husband.

1228
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:59,980
She was completely comfortable with him.

1229
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:05,340
'Mum loved you, you know,' said Beth.

1230
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:11,600
'Even when she didn't hear from you, she still
loved you.

1231
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:20,620
In fifty years, she didn't say one bad thing
about you.

1232
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:23,190
Not like grandpa - he didn't like hearing
your name.'

1233
01:43:23,190 --> 01:43:24,190
Beth laughed.

1234
01:43:24,190 --> 01:43:27,510
'I loved her, too,' said Huw.

1235
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:35,130
'The first years in Canada were so difficult
for me without her.'

1236
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:40,300
'She's a wonderful person,' said Beth warmly.

1237
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:44,250
'I hope she's going to be happy now.'

1238
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:52,120
'I want to make her happy,' replied Huw, not
understanding Beth's words.

1239
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:56,430
'Beth, I still love her.

1240
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:59,680
I want to marry her.'

1241
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:07,070
'Oh!' said Beth, and realised her mother had
not told Huw about Paul.

1242
01:44:07,070 --> 01:44:09,530
She had to say something.

1243
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:19,300
'Huw, has she talked to you about Paul, Paul
Henderson?' asked Beth.

1244
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:25,630
'She said he was a friend - why?'

1245
01:44:25,630 --> 01:44:34,440
Beth was quiet and Huw added, 'Is there something
more between them?'

1246
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:37,740
'Yes,' said Beth.

1247
01:44:37,740 --> 01:44:41,730
'They're planning to get married next month.

1248
01:44:41,730 --> 01:44:46,700
Mum's going to move to London.'

1249
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:52,490
'Does she love him?' asked Huw, quietly.

1250
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:54,980
'I think so...

1251
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:58,290
I don't know really...

1252
01:44:58,290 --> 01:45:00,980
You'll have to ask her.'

1253
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:08,560
Beth liked Paul very much and believed that
he was good for her mother.

1254
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:14,270
She thought they would have a happy future
together.

1255
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:22,270
But she also knew that things were no longer
that easy now Huw had come back into their

1256
01:45:22,270 --> 01:45:23,270
lives.

1257
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:32,230
She knew her mother still felt very deeply
about Huw - but it wasn't for her to say anything.

1258
01:45:32,230 --> 01:45:36,180
Her mother must decide for herself.

1259
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:42,910
'Have you told her how you feel?' asked Beth.

1260
01:45:42,910 --> 01:45:45,170
'No, it's too soon.

1261
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:54,110
I want to give her time to love me again.

1262
01:45:54,110 --> 01:45:57,370
Then I will.

1263
01:45:57,370 --> 01:46:03,130
I'm not going to lose her a second time,'
said Huw quietly.

1264
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:06,800
'I'm sure Mum will tell you about Paul.

1265
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:09,960
She doesn't like hiding things.

1266
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:15,150
And anyway, he's coming to Tredonald at the
weekend.

1267
01:46:15,150 --> 01:46:19,100
We're all having dinner together.

1268
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:25,680
Maybe you can meet him and see what you think.'

1269
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:33,530
Beth looked at Huw carefully and added, 'Please
be careful.

1270
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:37,570
I love my mother very much.

1271
01:46:37,570 --> 01:46:41,040
I don't want anybody to hurt her.'

1272
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:49,200
Huw touched Beth's hand and said, 'I won't
hurt her - not again,'

1273
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:59,500
Beth smiled at him and then looked up to see
her mother coming into the cafe.

1274
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:04,520
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
In love

1275
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:11,021
On the drive back to Tredonald, Huw talked
about Beth - how much he liked her, what a

1276
01:47:11,021 --> 01:47:16,610
warm person she was, how he wanted to see
more of her.

1277
01:47:16,610 --> 01:47:23,430
He'd decided it was safer to talk about Beth
rather than about him and Megan.

1278
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:31,110
'She's coming up to Tredonald on Saturday,
to have dinner with you and Paul, isn't she?

1279
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:37,170
Perhaps I'll be able to spend a little more
time with her then,' said Huw.

1280
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:43,180
'Yes, that's a good idea,' said Megan.

1281
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:48,550
'Beth's told you about Paul - that we're getting
married?

1282
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:51,920
Yes, of course, she did.

1283
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:59,440
I'm sorry, Huw, I did mean to tell you yesterday,
but it didn't seem the right time.'

1284
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:05,110
'When are you marrying him?' asked Huw.

1285
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:06,790
'21st September.

1286
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:13,460
I'm in the middle of selling the shop and
the flat at the moment.

1287
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:20,660
And when that's all finished, I'll move to
London.'

1288
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:27,090
Megan didn't feel very comfortable talking
to Huw about her future life with Paul.

1289
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:32,110
However, he seemed to be OK about it.

1290
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:38,360
'And what about Tredonald and all your friends
here?

1291
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,110
And Beth in Cardiff?

1292
01:48:40,110 --> 01:48:45,450
Won't you miss it all?' asked Huw.

1293
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:50,640
'Yes, of course,' said Megan quietly.

1294
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:57,510
'It'll be strange at first, but I'm ready
for a change.

1295
01:48:57,510 --> 01:49:03,620
The mine is working well - they don't need
me anymore.

1296
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:09,030
Beth and the grandchildren have their own
lives.

1297
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:15,530
And Paul and I haven't hurried - we've got
to know each other very well - and I know

1298
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:17,540
we'll be happy together.

1299
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:22,620
I've told him about you, and I'd like you
to meet him on Saturday.

1300
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:25,110
Will you join us for dinner?'

1301
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:27,190
'Thank you, I'd like to.

1302
01:49:27,190 --> 01:49:30,580
And can I ask you, Megan...

1303
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:33,860
do you love him?'

1304
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:36,370
Huw had to ask.

1305
01:49:36,370 --> 01:49:40,650
He couldn't just continue being nice.

1306
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:43,520
He couldn't hide what he felt any longer.

1307
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:47,670
'Do you feel that you can't live without him?

1308
01:49:47,670 --> 01:49:53,989
Are you happy every time you see him or hear
his voice on the phone?

1309
01:49:53,989 --> 01:49:55,360
Can you....?'

1310
01:49:55,360 --> 01:50:03,090
Huw had many more questions that he wanted
Megan to answer, but she stopped him.

1311
01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:04,090
'Huw!

1312
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:09,300
Why are you asking me all this?' asked Megan,
in surprise.

1313
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:14,520
'It isn't any of your business how I feel
about Paul!'

1314
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:17,280
'Maybe not,' replied Huw.

1315
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:24,810
'But I want you to be sure that you're doing
the right thing, and for the right reasons.'

1316
01:50:24,810 --> 01:50:28,989
Megan stopped the car at the side of the road
and turned to face Huw.

1317
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:35,110
'Of course I'm sure,' replied Megan a little
angrily.

1318
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:39,739
'Because I think we still love each other,'
said Huw.

1319
01:50:39,739 --> 01:50:46,980
'Well, perhaps I should say that I know I
love you.

1320
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:48,810
I've always loved you.

1321
01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:57,400
Even when I was married to Josie, deep inside
I knew that - and I think she did too.

1322
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:02,810
And I think you still feel something for me,
don't you?'

1323
01:51:02,810 --> 01:51:05,260
Megan sat looking straight ahead.

1324
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:08,350
She didn't know what to say.

1325
01:51:08,350 --> 01:51:13,590
'I don't want you to marry Paul,' he continued.

1326
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:16,550
'I want you to marry me.

1327
01:51:16,550 --> 01:51:22,890
And I've got about two weeks to make you feel
that, too.'

1328
01:51:22,890 --> 01:51:30,580
Huw hadn't meant to say it quite like that,
but he wanted Megan to be clear about how

1329
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:36,200
he felt - and he didn't have very much time.

1330
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:48,510
'Huw, you can't just come back into my life
after fifty years and start organising everything.

1331
01:51:48,510 --> 01:51:51,251
You don't love me, how can you?

1332
01:51:51,251 --> 01:51:55,210
You don't know me.

1333
01:51:55,210 --> 01:52:01,780
I think it's wonderful that we've been able
to meet again and become friends.

1334
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:05,630
But my future is with Paul.'

1335
01:52:05,630 --> 01:52:10,540
'Megan, I won't say any more about it.

1336
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:21,130
But I just want you to promise that you'll
think about what I've said,' Huw said quietly.

1337
01:52:21,130 --> 01:52:23,510
'How can I forget it?'

1338
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:25,480
thought Megan to herself.

1339
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:32,880
Megan started the car and they drove back
to Tredonald without saying a word to each

1340
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:33,880
other.

1341
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:40,150
Huw got out at his hotel and they said goodbye.

1342
01:52:40,150 --> 01:52:45,580
He said he would phone her the next day, but
they made no other plans.

1343
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:53,739
Huw felt it was better to give Megan some
time alone - even though he wanted to be with

1344
01:52:53,739 --> 01:52:58,210
her every minute of every day.

1345
01:52:58,210 --> 01:53:02,860
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
An old photograph

1346
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:05,540
Huw was right.

1347
01:53:05,540 --> 01:53:07,180
Megan did need time alone.

1348
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:14,890
Here she was, a woman of sixty-six, and two
men wanted to marry her!

1349
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:18,469
Of course she was not going to marry Huw.

1350
01:53:18,469 --> 01:53:20,050
He didn't really love her.

1351
01:53:20,050 --> 01:53:27,500
He'd just flown half way around the world,
and in two days had met his old love and a

1352
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,860
daughter he never knew he had.

1353
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:35,290
It was not surprising that he was saying things
he didn't really mean.

1354
01:53:35,290 --> 01:53:40,110
The next morning, Megan did some more packing.

1355
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:44,450
But it was difficult for her to escape from
thoughts of Huw.

1356
01:53:44,450 --> 01:53:52,420
Everything that she put into boxes or cases
seemed to throw her back to some time in the

1357
01:53:52,420 --> 01:53:54,080
past.

1358
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:56,180
And the past was Huw.

1359
01:53:56,180 --> 01:54:02,550
She rang Paul to check what time he was arriving
the next day.

1360
01:54:02,550 --> 01:54:08,950
He asked her how things had gone between Huw
and Beth and she told him it had gone well.

1361
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:15,420
They talked for a while about other things
and then Megan told him that Huw was joining

1362
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:17,260
them for dinner.

1363
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:19,660
Paul said that was fine.

1364
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:24,530
She didn't know if that was how he really
felt.

1365
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:30,030
But it was nice and easy talking with him,
and she felt safe.

1366
01:54:30,030 --> 01:54:38,890
After she'd put the phone down, she remembered
what Huw had asked her: Are you happy every

1367
01:54:38,890 --> 01:54:40,930
time you hear his voice?'

1368
01:54:40,930 --> 01:54:44,590
What kind of question was that?

1369
01:54:44,590 --> 01:54:51,150
It was the sort of thing you felt when you
were in love for the first time, not when

1370
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:53,080
you were her age.

1371
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:58,780
Then the phone rang again and this time it
was Huw.

1372
01:54:58,780 --> 01:55:06,460
He told her he'd been walking round the village
and had met someone that they'd been at school

1373
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:09,940
with, and how they'd had a laugh about the
old days.

1374
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:17,300
Then he said that he'd like to meet her for
a drink and maybe dinner if she would like

1375
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:18,300
to.

1376
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:21,940
'Seven o'clock at your hotel?' asked Megan.

1377
01:55:21,940 --> 01:55:26,219
'It'll be good to escape from the flat tonight.'

1378
01:55:26,219 --> 01:55:28,410
'Wonderful.

1379
01:55:28,410 --> 01:55:33,200
See you then,' said Huw.

1380
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:40,260
The conversation had been light, friendly
and... and Megan had been very happy to hear

1381
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:41,480
his voice.

1382
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:48,550
Just after seven that evening, Megan joined
Huw in the dining room of his hotel.

1383
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:55,270
Huw could see that she was a little tired
so he didn't talk about the two of them.

1384
01:55:55,270 --> 01:56:02,750
He told her about the wonderful wild areas
in the north of the country, and funny stories

1385
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:07,910
about the art world in Canada and how much
he loved living there.

1386
01:56:07,910 --> 01:56:13,480
Two hours passed in easy happy conversation.

1387
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:19,210
'Now, you tell me something,' said Huw, smiling
at her.

1388
01:56:19,210 --> 01:56:27,200
'Well, you know you said you saw Brian Perkins
earlier today,' said Megan.

1389
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:30,000
'I found this - look.'

1390
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,590
And she passed Huw a black and white photograph.

1391
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:42,390
He looked closely at it and saw a group of
about thirty children aged thirteen or fourteen,

1392
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:46,940
all standing very straight and smiling at
the camera.

1393
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:50,530
It was an old school photograph.

1394
01:56:50,530 --> 01:56:57,620
'And look, there's you at the back with Brian
Perkins,' Megan laughed.

1395
01:56:57,620 --> 01:57:00,980
'And there's me, just below you.

1396
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:05,469
We all look so young and fresh, don't we?'

1397
01:57:05,469 --> 01:57:08,730
'And I'm the only one not looking at the camera.

1398
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:09,730
I'm looking at you!

1399
01:57:09,730 --> 01:57:19,320
You see, even then I was only interested in
you,' said Huw.

1400
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:21,280
Megan moved on.

1401
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:24,620
She didn't want to give Huw the chance to
talk about her.

1402
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:32,160
She had brought some other photos for him
to look at - photos of friends and her family,

1403
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:36,750
and photos of Beth when she was a baby.

1404
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:43,150
She gave the ones of Beth to Huw, saying,
'Would you like to keep these?'

1405
01:57:43,150 --> 01:57:45,200
Huw put them in his pocket.

1406
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:51,500
'Time for me to go, I think,' said Megan.

1407
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:55,120
'I'll walk home with you,' said Huw.

1408
01:57:55,120 --> 01:58:01,360
They walked to her home through the quiet
streets of the village.

1409
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:06,469
'I'm happy I came back to see Tredonald,'
said Huw.

1410
01:58:06,469 --> 01:58:10,770
'It's not the terrible place I remember.

1411
01:58:10,770 --> 01:58:15,940
I'm sure I can put the past behind me now.'

1412
01:58:15,940 --> 01:58:25,320
'Good,' said Megan - and then thought, 'Does
that mean me as well?'

1413
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:34,690
But at her front door Huw said, 'Megan, I
can feel that all evening you've been hoping

1414
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:38,570
that I won't say anything about us.

1415
01:58:38,570 --> 01:58:44,510
And I won't, except I meant what I said yesterday.'

1416
01:58:44,510 --> 01:58:49,970
'Please Huw, let's not talk about it,' said
Megan.

1417
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:55,710
'Tomorrow you're going to meet Paul - the
man I'm going to marry.'

1418
01:58:55,710 --> 01:58:58,520
Megan took hold of his hands.

1419
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:00,800
'Thank you for a lovely evening.

1420
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:05,510
I'll see you here tomorrow.'

1421
01:59:05,510 --> 01:59:10,860
Megan went to bed that night knowing that
tomorrow's dinner was going to be difficult

1422
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:12,860
for all of them.

1423
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:19,610
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Dinner for five

1424
01:59:19,610 --> 01:59:22,150
'Paul, this is Huw.

1425
01:59:22,150 --> 01:59:24,030
Huw, Paul.'

1426
01:59:24,030 --> 01:59:28,590
Megan introduced the two men who shook hands.

1427
01:59:28,590 --> 01:59:34,010
Then she disappeared into the kitchen and
left them to make conversation.

1428
01:59:34,010 --> 01:59:36,980
Beth and Philip were late.

1429
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:41,700
She wanted them here now - she needed help.

1430
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:47,820
'I don't know what's happened to Beth and
Philip,' she said, walking over to the window

1431
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:49,230
of the sitting room.

1432
01:59:49,230 --> 01:59:55,370
Huw and Paul seemed to be talking quite happily.

1433
01:59:55,370 --> 02:00:02,090
'Probably Philip was late finishing his game
of golf,' said Paul, going over to stand by

1434
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:03,470
Megan's side.

1435
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:07,560
'He lives for his golf at the weekends, doesn't
he?

1436
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:10,900
Do you want another drink, love?'

1437
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:13,900
'No, I'd better not.

1438
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:17,650
Oh, here they are now.

1439
02:00:17,650 --> 02:00:18,650
Good.'

1440
02:00:18,650 --> 02:00:21,830
And Megan once again disappeared out of the
room.

1441
02:00:21,830 --> 02:00:24,690
'Sorry we're late, Mum.

1442
02:00:24,690 --> 02:00:27,680
My fault,' said Beth.

1443
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:32,130
'That's OK,' she said.

1444
02:00:32,130 --> 02:00:33,840
Beth and Philip both gave her a kiss.

1445
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:37,670
'I'll just go and finish off in the kitchen.

1446
02:00:37,670 --> 02:00:41,290
Dinner will be about ten minutes.

1447
02:00:41,290 --> 02:00:48,000
From the kitchen she could hear Paul laughing,
and then Beth.

1448
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,969
'Oh good,' she thought.

1449
02:00:50,969 --> 02:00:53,989
'Maybe it's all going to be fine.

1450
02:00:53,989 --> 02:00:59,800
Maybe I don't need to worry at all.'

1451
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:02,780
At dinner the conversation went well.

1452
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:11,020
Beth and Philip wanted to know all about Huw's
art, and Huw enjoyed talking about it.

1453
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:19,430
Paul also joined in - he knew an artist in
London who had bought one of Huw's paintings.

1454
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:28,760
Megan was able to sit back and listen; Paul
looked over at her and smiled.

1455
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:35,020
Megan watched, listened, joined in the conversation
- and compared.

1456
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:42,590
It was a terrible thing to do, but she found
that she was comparing Paul and Huw.

1457
02:01:42,590 --> 02:01:49,740
Huw with his brown face, his stories and the
past that they shared.

1458
02:01:49,740 --> 02:01:55,969
And kind Paul who'd made her feel good again,
and who was her future.

1459
02:01:55,969 --> 02:02:03,690
It was strange to see the two halves of her
life here in the same room.

1460
02:02:03,690 --> 02:02:09,941
Once or twice she saw Huw looking a little
sad - when Beth had said something about her

1461
02:02:09,941 --> 02:02:10,941
younger life.

1462
02:02:10,941 --> 02:02:18,800
And she realised that he was trying hard to
keep the conversation light, and not ask too

1463
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:21,400
many questions about the past.

1464
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:26,370
At midnight, Huw stood up to go.

1465
02:02:26,370 --> 02:02:29,750
The others were staying the night at Megan's.

1466
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:36,930
'Don't forget, Megan, we're meeting at ten
tomorrow morning for our tour of the mine.'

1467
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:38,790
'I haven't forgotten.

1468
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:47,480
I'll leave everybody here doing the washing-up
and I'll see you at the entrance to the mine.'

1469
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:50,450
Everybody stood up to say their goodbyes.

1470
02:02:50,450 --> 02:02:57,760
Paul shook his hand and said, 'I've enjoyed
meeting you, Huw, and maybe some day Megan

1471
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:00,489
and I can visit you in Canada.

1472
02:03:00,489 --> 02:03:04,070
I'd love to try that fishing you were telling
me about.'

1473
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:08,090
Huw said nothing but just smiled.

1474
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:17,832
At the door, he turned and said, 'Paul, I
believe that you're a good man and I hope

1475
02:03:17,832 --> 02:03:21,860
you and Megan will be very happy together.'

1476
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:24,190
He kissed Beth and Megan.

1477
02:03:24,190 --> 02:03:31,910
As the door closed behind him, Beth looked
at her mother.

1478
02:03:31,910 --> 02:03:37,940
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Time to go

1479
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:43,860
At ten the next morning, Huw and Megan stepped
into the lift to go down the mine.

1480
02:03:43,860 --> 02:03:47,721
It was a modern lift - not like the one that
Huw remembered.

1481
02:03:47,721 --> 02:03:53,920
He felt as if he was in a large shop rather
than a coal mine.

1482
02:03:53,920 --> 02:04:00,980
But when the doors opened at the bottom, he
was immediately taken back fifty years.

1483
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:04,630
It was the smell.

1484
02:04:04,630 --> 02:04:10,160
You might be able to make everything modern,
but you could never lose the smell of coal,

1485
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:12,430
he thought.

1486
02:04:12,430 --> 02:04:14,940
He followed Megan down one of the tunnels.

1487
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:20,070
It was lit now, but he didn't need the light.

1488
02:04:20,070 --> 02:04:25,340
He knew that he'd be able to find his way
around with his eyes closed.

1489
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:29,680
It was a quiet world down there.

1490
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:32,469
The last miner had left years ago.

1491
02:04:32,469 --> 02:04:36,780
'Do you mind if I walk a bit by myself?'

1492
02:04:36,780 --> 02:04:38,260
Huw asked Megan.

1493
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:43,920
He wanted to have some private time to remember
Gareth.

1494
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:47,719
'Of course,' said Megan.

1495
02:04:47,719 --> 02:04:51,200
'I'll wait here.'

1496
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:55,110
She watched him walk away from her with his
hands in his pockets.

1497
02:04:55,110 --> 02:04:59,890
This morning she felt flat - maybe even a
bit sad.

1498
02:04:59,890 --> 02:05:09,810
The feeling had come to her last night, when
Huw had wished her and Paul a happy life together.

1499
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:15,430
She realised that Huw had accepted her and
Paul as a couple.

1500
02:05:15,430 --> 02:05:22,780
So he didn't want to marry her after all,
he didn't love her - why did that make her

1501
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:23,780
feel sad?

1502
02:05:23,780 --> 02:05:30,090
She should be pleased that he was not going
to make things difficult for her.

1503
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:32,469
Huw came back.

1504
02:05:32,469 --> 02:05:39,700
'What a short life poor Gareth had,' he said
quietly.

1505
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:46,600
'I know,' said Megan, and she reached out
to take his hand.

1506
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:50,980
'The night he died was just...'

1507
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:59,260
Huw didn't continue, but Megan knew what he
felt - she remembered that terrible night

1508
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:00,270
too.

1509
02:06:00,270 --> 02:06:04,820
They walked towards the lift hand in hand.

1510
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:09,950
'You OK?' asked Megan quietly.

1511
02:06:09,950 --> 02:06:12,660
'Yes and no.'

1512
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:18,090
Huw looked down at her and said, 'I've decided
to go back to Toronto.

1513
02:06:18,090 --> 02:06:20,239
I'm flying tomorrow evening.'

1514
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:24,940
'Oh Huw, why so soon?'

1515
02:06:24,940 --> 02:06:28,120
Megan was completely shaken.

1516
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:32,000
'It's no good, Megan.

1517
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:38,760
I realise that I can't just arrive after fifty
years, tell you I love you and expect you

1518
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:42,810
to leave everything and come away with me.

1519
02:06:42,810 --> 02:06:45,650
So I've decided to go back early.

1520
02:06:45,650 --> 02:06:49,910
There's no reason for me to stay any longer.'

1521
02:06:49,910 --> 02:06:53,710
'But what about Beth?' asked Megan.

1522
02:06:53,710 --> 02:06:58,989
'Don't you want to spend some more time with
her?'

1523
02:06:58,989 --> 02:07:06,410
'Yes, and I will, but not now,' answered Huw.

1524
02:07:06,410 --> 02:07:13,280
'I'll write to her, of course, and I hope
I'll be able to see her again either here

1525
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:16,180
or in Canada.'

1526
02:07:16,180 --> 02:07:23,300
'So, you're going away again, and leaving
us,' said Megan.

1527
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:26,650
'Beth is going to be very sorry.'

1528
02:07:26,650 --> 02:07:32,440
'I don't feel, there's anything else I can
do, Megan.

1529
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:39,320
I've told you how I feel - I love you and
I want to marry you.

1530
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:47,130
It would hurt too much to watch you and Paul
together, or to hear you talking about him.'

1531
02:07:47,130 --> 02:07:53,670
They reached the top of the mine and walked
out into the sunshine.

1532
02:07:53,670 --> 02:08:03,239
'Oh Huw, I don't know what to say,' said Megan.

1533
02:08:03,239 --> 02:08:11,989
'I don't want you to go, I feel as if I'm
just getting to know you again.

1534
02:08:11,989 --> 02:08:21,700
Everything has happened so quickly in the
last few days - but they've been wonderful

1535
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:23,010
days.'

1536
02:08:23,010 --> 02:08:27,050
Outside Megan's home, Huw turned and took
her hands.

1537
02:08:27,050 --> 02:08:38,289
'I'm leaving Tredonald after breakfast tomorrow,
so I think this is goodbye - for now,' Huw

1538
02:08:38,289 --> 02:08:41,340
found it difficult to speak.

1539
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:45,930
'I'll keep in touch with you and Beth, of
course.

1540
02:08:45,930 --> 02:08:54,120
I'm not sorry I came back, but I wish with
all my heart that the ending could be different.

1541
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:56,790
Goodbye, sweet Megan.

1542
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:58,570
Be happy.'

1543
02:08:58,570 --> 02:09:07,320
Huw kissed her lips, her eyes, her nose - everywhere
on her face.

1544
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:10,830
Then he walked away.

1545
02:09:10,830 --> 02:09:19,140
He turned around once and saw that Megan was
still standing outside her front door.

1546
02:09:19,140 --> 02:09:20,210
He gave a little wave.

1547
02:09:20,210 --> 02:09:22,719
His face was wet with tears.

1548
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:23,719
* * *

1549
02:09:23,719 --> 02:09:29,410
The next morning, Huw packed his suitcase,
feeling bad.

1550
02:09:29,410 --> 02:09:34,662
He stopped when he came to the photo of Megan
and Beth, and looked at it with love.

1551
02:09:34,662 --> 02:09:42,960
He remembered how fifty years ago, when he
was about to leave for Canada, he had packed

1552
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:47,449
his drawing of Megan with the same feeling
of love.

1553
02:09:47,449 --> 02:09:52,280
Then, there had been all those years without
her.

1554
02:09:52,280 --> 02:10:00,720
Finding her again had been so wonderful, but
now the future seemed empty.

1555
02:10:00,720 --> 02:10:08,480
Downstairs, Huw paid his hotel bill at reception
and walked out to his car.

1556
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:16,410
As he was getting in, he heard someone behind
him and turned round.

1557
02:10:16,410 --> 02:10:18,660
There was Megan.

1558
02:10:18,660 --> 02:10:27,520
They looked at each other for a few seconds
and then fell into each other's arms.

1559
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:33,880
'Oh, Huw, I've been awake all night thinking
about you.

1560
02:10:33,880 --> 02:10:38,720
I kept remembering how I felt when you left
me fifty years ago.

1561
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:42,830
I can't let you leave me again.

1562
02:10:42,830 --> 02:10:48,710
You're part of me - I feel complete with you.'

1563
02:10:48,710 --> 02:10:57,550
'What do you want me to do then?' asked Huw
softly, loving the sound of Megan's words.

1564
02:10:57,550 --> 02:11:04,670
'Ask me to marry you again,' she replied in
a shaking voice.

1565
02:11:04,670 --> 02:11:07,250
'Megan, marry me.

1566
02:11:07,250 --> 02:11:12,400
Be my girl again,' Huw said.

1567
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:15,810
'Of course, Huw,' she answered.

1568
02:11:15,810 --> 02:11:17,480
'Of course.'

1569
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:20,810
They were both crying.

1570
02:11:20,810 --> 02:11:28,590
They cried because of the years they had lost
- years they would never get back.

1571
02:11:28,590 --> 02:11:31,110
But they also cried because they were happy.

1572
02:11:31,110 --> 02:11:40,070
They still had time: they had tomorrow and
the next day and the next...

1573
02:11:40,070 --> 02:12:16,440
They had a second chance of a wonderful future
together and this time nothing would go wrong.

1574
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:26,380
- THE END -
