1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,350
Who is Muhammad Ali?

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,360
Why is he famous?

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:17,080
Why did he have two names, Cassius Clay in
his early years, and later Muhammad Ali?

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,670
And what is he doing now?

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:28,090
Muhammad Ali was, of course, a famous boxer,
a world champion.

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,029
But he fought for black Americans, mo.

7
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:38,050
He stopped boxing in 1981 because he was sick.

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,630
But today he is fighting for peace in the
world.

9
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:50,720
The Red and White Bike
The story starts with a boy's new red and

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,040
white bike.

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,030
It is 1954.

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:03,880
Joe Martin is a policeman in Louisville Kentucky,
but he teaches boxing in a gym in the evenings,

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,260
too.

14
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,790
One-day two young black boys come into the
gym.

15
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,970
One of them sees Joe.

16
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,590
"Excuse me," he says.

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,840
"Are you Joe Martin, the policeman?"

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,640
"That's right."

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,430
Joe says.

20
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,120
"What's your problem?"

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,840
"It's my new bike," the boy says.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,000
"It's red and white.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,290
It was in front of this building, and now
it's not there."

24
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,540
The young boy is unhappy and very angry.

25
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,670
"I'm going to find the boy with my bike.

26
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:53,240
Then I'm going to whup him!" he says again
and again.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,590
Joe Martin smiles.

28
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,619
The boy is about twelve years old.

29
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,380
He is tall with long legs, and he is thin.

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,150
"Can you box?"

31
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,990
Joe asks.

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:15,700
"No, I can't box," the boy says, "But I want
to whup that boy,"

33
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,170
Joe smiles again "Come here to the gym first.

34
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,020
Maybe I can teach you."

35
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,700
"OK," the boy says.

36
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,760
"I'd like that."

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,820
"Good," Joe says.

38
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,880
"What's your name?"

39
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,810
"Cassius," the boy says.

40
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,950
"Cassius Clay."

41
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:49,730
Joe doesn't know it, but in only ten years
that young black boy is going to be a world

42
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,819
boxing champion!

43
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:59,980
After that, Cassius went to Joe Martin's gym
six days a week.

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:06,319
He was strong and quick on his feet, and he
started boxing with the other boys in the

45
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,569
gym.

46
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:12,140
He didn't box tor money, of course.

47
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,990
He boxed because he liked it.

48
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,000
He usually won his fights.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,099
He was good!

50
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,030
But he wasn't a good student at school.

51
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,090
He had a lot of problems.

52
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,160
He was a good boy from a good family.

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,830
He was friendly and his teachers liked him.

54
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,220
But school work was very difficult for him.

55
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:48,600
The only important thing in the world for
him then was boxing.

56
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:58,420
In six years, he had 108 fights and he won
100 of them.

57
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:09,069
Then in 1960, he went to Rome and boxed for
the United States.

58
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:19,269
The Olympic Games
In 1960, Cassius was only eighteen years old.

59
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,960
He was in Rome for the Olympic Games.

60
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:30,330
He beat every opponent and he won an Olympic
medal for the United States.

61
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,059
He was an Olympic boxing champion.

62
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:41,759
And he didn't take off his Olympic medal for
weeks-night or day.

63
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,389
At home in Louisville, he was famous.

64
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,379
But he was black.

65
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:55,939
And in Louisville in the 1960s there were
places for white people and places for black

66
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:58,589
people.

67
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:07,839
In many hotels, theaters, stores, and buses,
black people didn't sit with white people.

68
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:15,320
One day Cassius wanted to buy a drink in a
"white" store.

69
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,150
It was a problem.

70
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,960
"Whites only," they said.

71
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:29,060
"But I'm the Olympic boxing champion - I'm
famous," Cassius said.

72
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,189
"Whites only," they answered.

73
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,259
"Go away!"

74
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:39,860
Cassius was very unhappy about that.

75
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,939
"I'm going to be the World Champion," he said.

76
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:47,800
"I'm going to be important.

77
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:56,039
Then white people are going to sit down with
me and listen to me."

78
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,830
After the Olympic Games Cassius started to
fight for money.

79
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,330
Boxing wasn't a game now.

80
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,490
It was his work.

81
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,089
He moved from Louisville to Miami.

82
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:17,999
He went to a new gym in Miami, and he had
new friends.

83
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:18,999
One of them was

84
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:22,050
Angelo Dundee.

85
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:29,509
He worked with Cassius in the gym and was
always with him for his fights.

86
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:37,399
The First Fight with Sonny Liston

87
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:43,599
In 1964, Cassius Clay was twenty-two years
old.

88
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:46,729
He was tall and strong.

89
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:55,249
After nineteen fights and nineteen wins, he
wanted to fight the world champion, Sonny

90
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,999
Liston.

91
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:02,599
Clay always moved very quickly in his fights.

92
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,569
He danced here and there in the ring.

93
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:11,869
His opponents were big, strong men.

94
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:19,409
But they lost because their punches usually
didn't hit him.

95
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:27,369
But Liston was the world champion and a very
strong boxer.

96
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:33,619
The newspapers in the U.S. said, "Liston is
going to win this tight.

97
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,559
Clay is very young.

98
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:40,369
Liston is going to kill him."

99
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:50,569
Only three newspapers said, "Maybe Clay can
beat the champion."

100
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:59,030
The fight was in Miami, and it was on television
in a lot of American theaters, too.

101
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:05,669
Young Cassius Clay wanted to be famous and
make a lot of money.

102
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:09,449
Before his fights, he played a game.

103
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,569
He talked and talked.

104
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:21,779
Usually boxers were quiet men, but Clay's
mouth was always open.

105
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:27,999
Before every light ho said to the people and
the newspapers.

106
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,379
"I'm beautiful.

107
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,750
I'm good.

108
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,930
Pm quick and strong.

109
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:46,060
Pm going to beat that man in two, or three,
or four rounds."

110
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,980
White people were angry with him.

111
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,959
They didn't like this young black man with
the big mouth.

112
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,069
"Kill him!"

113
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,519
they said to his opponents.

114
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,800
"Close that big mouth for him."

115
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:13,209
But then, of course, a lot of people wanted
to see the fight Before the tight with Sonny

116
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:17,700
Liston, Clay played this same game.

117
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:25,720
Liston was very strong, but he wasn't very
quick.

118
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,110
The fight is on February 25.

119
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,680
In round 1 Clay starts to dance.

120
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,500
Liston can't hit him.

121
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:47,170
Sometimes Clay hits his opponent's face - one,
two very quick punches.

122
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,880
Then he moves away.

123
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,990
Liston goes after him, but slowly.

124
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:03,950
He is big and strong, but he can't hit the
young Clay.

125
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,519
Clay goes back to his chair.

126
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,050
He smiles at his friend, Angelo Dundee.

127
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:18,579
"That's the first round, and he didn't kill
me," he says.

128
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:22,800
"I can win this."

129
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,500
Liston is on his feet.

130
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,000
He doesn't want to sit down.

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,620
He wants to start round 2.

132
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:40,750
But it is the same story in rounds 2 and 3
and 4.

133
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:47,319
Clay dances across the ring and Liston can't
catch him.

134
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:55,720
Sometimes he hits Clay, of course but Clay
is always moving away.

135
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,840
And he is hitting Liston's face and eyes all
the time.

136
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,790
After six rounds, Liston sits down.

137
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:13,080
His face is red and one eye is closing.

138
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,930
Suddenly he is very tired.

139
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:22,870
"That man can hit!" he says.

140
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,949
Now it is round 7 and Clay is standing up
on his feet.

141
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:34,850
He is waiting, but his opponent isn't moving
from his chair.

142
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:44,250
Cassius Clay is the new champion of the world
and he is only twenty-two years old.

143
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,600
He calls to the newspaper men near the ring.

144
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,790
"I am the champion.

145
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,790
I'm beautiful.

146
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,790
I'm number one in the world.

147
00:11:52,790 --> 00:12:06,829
And you were all wrong, wrong, wrong!

148
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:15,940
A New Name and New Problems
The day after that first fight with Liston,

149
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,069
Cassius Clay had a new name.

150
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:25,829
"My name is not Cassius Clay now," he said.

151
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:31,370
"It's Muhammad Ali."

152
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,210
Ali's family was unhappy about this.

153
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:42,990
His father, "Cash Clay, and his mother were
good Christian people.

154
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:49,370
Their two sons were always good Christians,
too.

155
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,850
They loved their mother and father and had
a happy home.

156
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:01,379
"What's wrong with the name 'Clay'?" his father
asked.

157
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:04,070
"It's a good name.

158
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,950
It's our name."

159
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:12,569
"Clay is a white man's name," Ali said.

160
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:19,670
"We have that name because our family worked
for Mr. Clay, a white man.

161
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:27,850
Our family came from Africa, and I would like
a new name, a 'black' name.

162
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:35,939
And from today, I'm going to be a Muslim,
because in the U.S. white people are Christians,

163
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:45,009
My black brothers are Muslims and I'm going
to be a Muslim, too."

164
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:51,029
Later that year Ali visited Egypt and Africa.

165
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:53,130
He talked to Muslims there.

166
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:59,129
"There are Muslims of all colors in the world,"
he said.

167
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,259
"I know that now.

168
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:08,949
Our problem in the U.S. is only with the bad
white people there."

169
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:16,310
But he liked his new Muslim name and he stayed
a Muslim.

170
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,860
Fifteen months later, he and Sonny Liston
fought again.

171
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:29,990
This time Liston was on his face on the floor
in the first round.

172
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:38,110
Muhammad Ali was the world-boxing champion.

173
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,680
In 1967, the U.S. Army was in Vietnam.

174
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:54,629
Thousands of young Americans, white and black,
went into the U.S. Army and fought the Vietcong.

175
00:14:54,629 --> 00:15:03,129
The U.S. government called Muhammad Ali and
said, "Your country wants you in the army.

176
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:08,170
You have to go to Vietnam."

177
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:14,389
Ali answered, "I'm a Muslim and Muslims want
peace.

178
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:16,690
They don t fight and kill people.

179
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,699
Who are the Vietcong?

180
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:24,550
They don't want to kill me, and I don't want
to kill them.

181
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,160
I'm not going to go into the army!"

182
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,420
This was a big problem.

183
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:42,220
The U.S. government said, "Go into the army,
or go to jail."

184
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:49,499
The American people were angry with Ali, and
they really didn't like him.

185
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:53,990
"You can't box in the U.S.

186
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:59,410
You can't be world champion," the government
said.

187
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:05,540
"And you can't go and box in other countries."

188
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,699
But Ali didn't go into the army.

189
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:13,449
"I'm a boxer," he said.

190
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:18,740
"I fight people because that's my job.

191
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,389
But I don't kill people."

192
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:28,360
Ali didn't box for two years.

193
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,129
He talked to students in schools and got a
little money.

194
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:37,629
He talked about peace in Vietnam.

195
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:46,029
"The fighting in Vietnam is wrong," he always
said.

196
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:54,790
The government didn't send him to jail, but
he didn't have much money.

197
00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:04,380
Then in 1970 the U.S. government said, "You
can box again."

198
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:14,159
But there was a new world champion now, Joe
Frazier.

199
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:23,510
Joe Frazier, A New Opponent
Joe Frazier was a good boxer.

200
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,160
He was strong and quick.

201
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,140
He was an Olympic champion, too.

202
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:40,710
He won his medal at the Olympic Games in Tokyo
in 1964 Ali's first fight with him was in

203
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,970
New York in 1971.

204
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:51,860
But two years away from boxing is a long time.

205
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,390
The tight was very difficult tor Alt.

206
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:02,299
He danced, but he was slow and tired.

207
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:11,110
He fought well, but after fifteen long rounds
Frazier won.

208
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,490
But Ali didn't stop fighting.

209
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:28,110
After thirteen lights and twelve wins, he
fought Joe Frazier again in New York in 1974.

210
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:38,059
Frazier fought well, but after a long and
difficult fight, this time Ali was the winner.

211
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:40,820
This time, Ali was the winner.

212
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,059
But Ali wasn't the world champion after that
fight.

213
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:51,280
At that, time there was a new world champion,
George Foreman.

214
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:59,450
"I want to be world champion again," Ali said.

215
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:04,390
And only George Foreman can stop me now.

216
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:11,559
When and where can I fight him?"

217
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:21,070
Ali and Foreman - The Big Fight
The Ali - Foreman fight wasn't in the U.S.

218
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:27,559
It was in Kinshasa, in Zaire.

219
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:31,190
Ali loved Africa.

220
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,970
Zaire was a black country.

221
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,980
The government was black.

222
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:47,299
Ali stayed in a beautiful big hotel, and the
people there loved him.

223
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:54,980
He was on the streets of Kinshasa every day
and people called to him, "'Ali!

224
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,980
Bomaye!

225
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,980
Ali!

226
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
Bomaye!'"

227
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
"Bomaye?

228
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:07,960
What are they saying?"

229
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,321
Ali asked a man.

230
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:13,690
The man had a big smile.

231
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,559
"They're saying, Ali!

232
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:20,140
Kill him!"

233
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,809
Of course, George Foreman was a black American,
too.

234
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:33,260
But Africans loved Ali because he wanted peace
in Vietnam.

235
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:40,580
And he was very famous because he didn't go
into the U.S. Army.

236
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:46,740
But George Foreman was a very big, strong
boxer.

237
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:53,440
He was twenty-five years old and Ali was thirty-two.

238
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,350
And Foreman wasn't slow and heavy.

239
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:10,300
At four o'clock on the morning of October
30 1974, Ali and Foreman start the big fight.

240
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,980
It is very hot in Kinshasa.

241
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:20,180
There is going to be heavy rain later in the
day.

242
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:27,590
In round 1 Ali starts to move and dance across
the ring.

243
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,140
Foreman comes after him.

244
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:36,760
In the first round, there is no winner.

245
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,190
Ali sits down.

246
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:44,880
"I can't dance for fifteen rounds," he thinks.

247
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,100
"It's very hot, and Foreman is quick.

248
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,820
The old game isn't going to work."

249
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,610
In round 2 Ali stops dancing.

250
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,490
He tries a new game.

251
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,700
He is going to make his opponent tired.

252
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,170
He moves slowly.

253
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,669
Sometimes he only stands there.

254
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:21,230
Foreman hit him with big, heavy punches.

255
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,049
People call out.

256
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:25,940
"Dance, Ali!

257
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,390
Dance!

258
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,590
Don't stop moving.

259
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:34,070
He's killing you."

260
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:41,660
For six rounds, Foreman hits Ali again and
again.

261
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,039
But Ali stays on his feet.

262
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,279
In round 8.

263
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:51,540
Foreman is getting slow.

264
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,250
He is very hot and tired.

265
00:22:54,250 --> 00:23:00,460
His hands are heavy slow.

266
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:06,470
Suddenly Ali is quick and strong again.

267
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,019
He hits his opponent again and again.

268
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:14,529
And suddenly Foreman is on the floor.

269
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:18,450
He can't stand up.

270
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,149
Ali is dancing.

271
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,140
He is the world champion again.

272
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:28,860
He is the world champion again.

273
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,710
Ali stayed the champion for six years.

274
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:43,830
He beat Joe Frazier again in Manila in 1975
after a long and difficult fight.

275
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:52,320
In 1978, Ali lost a fight with Leon Spinks
in Las Vegas.

276
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,280
But then, seven months later, he beat him.

277
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:06,470
Ali was the new world champion three times
in fourteen years.

278
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:19,260
A Quiet Time with his Family
In 1980, Ali lost a fight with Larry Holmes,

279
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:25,720
and in 1981, he lost again to Trevor Burbick.

280
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,360
He was slow and tired.

281
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,200
He wasn't well, and he well, and he went to
a doctor.

282
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,929
"You're very sick," the doctor said.

283
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:44,049
"And you're not going to get well.

284
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:53,539
It's not going to kill you, but you're going
to get tired very quickly every day You're

285
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:59,049
going to walk slowly and talk slowly.

286
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:03,549
I'm sorry but we can't stop it.

287
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:11,220
And, of course, you can't box."

288
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,010
Ali stopped boxing.

289
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:23,889
Now he lives quietly with his family in a
big house in the country in Michigan.

290
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:30,559
In the U.S. today, there are no places for
"whites only."

291
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:37,950
On television and in movies there are faces
of all colors.

292
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,309
People are people.

293
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:51,149
Ali is happy because he was one of the first
famous black Americans.

294
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:57,019
And now Ali is working for peace in the world.

295
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:00,149
He makes money with his famous name.

296
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:06,529
He meets and talks with governments and other
famous people.

297
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:09,480
He gets medals these days, too.

298
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:22,559
He is a worker for peace in the world, peace
for all people-blacks and whites, Christians

299
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,789
and Muslims.

300
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:29,200
In the U.S. they now say.

301
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,860
"Ali was right.

302
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,270
We were wrong about Vietnam.

303
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:41,330
He fought tor his people and for peace.

304
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:47,870
He is our American Nelson Mandela.

305
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:52,350
Ali gives a lot of money to the children of
the world.

306
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,110
He loves children.

307
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,860
He always loved children.

308
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,490
There are nine children in his family.

309
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,559
He moves very slowly now.

310
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,330
He sits at home.

311
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:15,010
He gets tired very quickly.

312
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:20,029
He likes watching his old fights on television.

313
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:26,029
He is a good Muslim and a good man.

314
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:30,639
People visit him and talk with him.

315
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:36,889
Young Muhammad Ali talked and worked for black
Americans.

316
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:40,020
Then he was a famous boxing champion.

317
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,700
But today they call him a peoples champion.

318
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:44,809
- THE END -
