CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,520
Rassendylls and Elphbergs

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,960
'When are you going to do something, 
Rudolf?' my sister-in-law asked me one day.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,320
'What do you mean, Rose?'

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,800
'When are you going to find some work?'

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,440
'Work!' I replied.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,600
'I don't need to work. I'm a Rassendyll. 
My family is one of the best in England.  

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm rich - I don't need to do anything.'

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,200
'Your brother works,' Rose reminded 
me crossly. 'He works very hard.'

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,080
Just at that moment my brother Robert 
came into the room. He looked at his wife.  

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,040
He could see that she was angry about something.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,880
'What's wrong, dear?' he asked.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,400
'Rose is angry because I don't do anything,' 
I explained. 'I told her I don't need to work.  

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,280
We Rassendylls don't need to do anything.'

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,040
I looked at my sister-in-law again. 
She was looking at my red hair.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,560
'Perhaps she's also angry because 
I've got red hair,' I joked.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,640
Rose blushed.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,840
'Don't be silly!' she told me. 'That's not 
your fault. But all the same,' she went on,  

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,480
'your red hair does remind people of that 
story about the Rassendylls. It's a pity.'

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,880
Robert smiled at me.

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,720
'Of course it's not his 
fault,' he said cheerfully.  

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,800
'He's got the nose as well,' 
he added thoughtfully.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,920
'I like my nose, and J like my hair,' I told them.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,640
I turned to look at the picture 
of Countess Amelia on the wall.

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,440
Rose saw where I was looking. 
She became angry again.

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,360
'That picture!' she complained to Robert.  

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,400
'People will never forget the story 
if you don't take that picture down.'

28
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,800
'People will never forget the story 
while Rudolf's here,' Robert said.  

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,840
'Look at his red hair - and that nose!'

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,960
Then I decided to annoy Rose a little.

31
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,000
'Actually,' I said, 'I like being an Elphberg.'

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,640
'Rudolf!' Rose cried. 'How can you say that?'

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,840
I'm sure you want to know why Rose 
was so angry about my red hair  

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,960
and my nose. I'll tell you the whole story.

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:38,080
We Rassendylls are a very old family. Old families 
have scandals, and we have a very interesting one.  

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,880
It all happened a long time ago - in 1733.

37
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:53,120
The young prince of Ruritania came to England 
that year. Prince Rudolf Elphberg was a tall man,  

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,560
and he had red hair and a long nose. He was a 
dashing figure, and was popular everywhere he  

39
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,680
went. He was a good linguist, he could ride well, 
and he was an excellent marksman and swordsman.

40
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,800
The Prince stayed in England for a long 
time, and then something strange happened.  

41
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:25,360
One day he fought a duel with an Englishman. The 
Englishman's name was James Rassendyll. Rassendyll  

42
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,160
wounded the Prince. The Prince was not badly 
hurt, but he returned to Ruritania after the duel.

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,360
A few months later James Rassendyll died. 
His wife, the Countess Amelia, had a son  

44
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,280
who was born after Rassendyll's death. The baby 
looked exactly like Prince Elphberg. He had red  

45
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,960
hair and a long nose. Now everybody understood 
why Rassendyll and the Prince had fought a duel!

46
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,960
Ever since that time, there have always been 
some Rassendylls who have red hair and long  

47
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:14,160
noses. We call them 'Elphberg' Rassendylls. 
I'm an 'Elphberg' Rassendyll myself, you see.

48
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,480
Rose did not like the old story of Countess Amelia 
and the Prince of Ruritania. It embarrassed her.  

49
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,920
Almost as much as my Elphberg features embarrassed 
her. She thought that my features showed the  

50
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:34,800
weakness of character and the uselessness of my 
life. However, I thought that I had learnt quite  

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,960
a lot. I spoke fluent German, my French was very 
good, and my Italian was acceptable. I was good  

52
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,960
enough with a pistol, but not excellent. 
I could also ride any horse you gave me.

53
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,640
I started to think about 
Ruritania over the next few days.  

54
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,480
I thought about Countess Amelia and the 
Prince. It was a romantic story. I knew  

55
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:09,840
that the old King was dead. His son, another 
Prince Rudolf, was going to be the next King.  

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,360
I decided to visit Ruritania. I wanted to see 
the coronation of the young Prince Rudolf.

57
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,480
I did not tell my brother Robert 
of my plan to visit Ruritania.  

58
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,160
I told him I was going to the 
Tyrol for a short holiday.

59
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,760
I was very excited when I left England.  

60
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,840
I did not know that I was going on a great 
adventure - the greatest adventure of my life!
 
 
 

61
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,960
CHAPTER TWO

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840
The Journey to Ruritania

63
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,840
I decided to stay in Paris for 
a night on my way to Ruritania.  

64
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,640
Paris is a lively city, 
and I enjoyed myself a lot.  

65
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,920
I spent the evening with two friends. One of 
them, George, worked in the British Embassy.

66
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,080
We were three young men, and we talked 
about the beautiful women in Paris.  

67
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,720
Somebody mentioned Antoinette De Mauban.

68
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,120
'I've heard of her,' I said excitedly. 'She's 
a famous beauty. What does she look like?'

69
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,640
'She's the most wonderful woman in Paris,' 
George told me. 'You won't see her, I'm afraid,'  

70
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,720
he added. 'She's leaving Paris tonight.'

71
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,760
He spoke quietly now.

72
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,440
'The Duke of Strelsau visited 
here in Paris,' he said.

73
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,480
'Really,' I replied. 'I 
wonder I where she's going.'

74
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,840
I knew that the Duke of Strelsau was the 
half-brother of Prince Rudolf of Ruritania.  

75
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,720
Perhaps Antoinette De Mauban 
was going to Ruritania as well!

76
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,480
George went to the railway station with me the 
next day. I did not tell him I was travelling  

77
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,720
to Ruritania because I did not want anyone 
to know. I told him I was going to Dresden.

78
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,640
There was a smartly dressed lady 
on the platform when we arrived.

79
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,800
'Excuse me, Rudolf,' he said. 'I know that lady.  

80
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,680
I'll just go and say hello 
to her. I won't be long.'

81
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,280
He went to talk to the lady. He 
was smiling when he came back.

82
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,040
'You're in luck!' he joked. 
'That's Antoinette De Mauban,  

83
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,320
and she's travelling on your train. 
She's going to Dresden as well.'

84
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,960
I did not see Antoinette De Mauban again 
until the train arrived at Dresden.  

85
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,400
I got off the train there because I 
wanted to take the train for Ruritania.  

86
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:57,040
Then I saw her! Antoinette De Mauban got on the 
same train as me. She was travelling to Ruritania  

87
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,360
as well. Perhaps she was going 
to visit the Duke of Strelsau.

88
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,520
As soon as we reached the Ruritanian 
border, I went to buy some newspapers  

89
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,440
and the officer in charge of the customs house 
gave me such a stare that I was surer than  

90
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,840
ever of my resemblance to the Elphbergs.The 
train journey to Ruritania was a long one.  

91
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,080
I read some of the Ruritanian 
newspapers during the journey.

92
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,560
There were lots of articles about 
Prince Rudolf and the coronation.  

93
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,040
The capital city, Strelsau, was full of 
people who wanted to see the ceremony.  

94
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,520
I did not want to stay in a crowded 
hotel, so I decided not to go to Strelsau.  

95
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,200
There is a little town called Zenda 
about fifty miles from the capital.  

96
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,360
I decided to stay there until the day of the 
coronation.'I can travel into Strelsau every  

97
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,480
day on the train,' I said to myself, i can come 
back to Zenda every night. It's not very far.'

98
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,360
I got off the train at Zenda. There was a good 
hotel in the town. I was comfortable there.

99
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,760
There was a lot of excitement in Zenda because of 
the coronation. Everybody was talking about Prince  

100
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:27,200
Rudolf and his half-brother, the Duke of Strelsau. 
I learned that the Duke owned the castle in Zenda.

101
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,840
Everybody spoke very well about the Duke. They 
made less friendly remarks about Prince Rudolf.  

102
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,800
He had spent a long time away from the country, 
and very few people even knew what he looked like.  

103
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,000
I heard that he had also 
shaved off his famous beard  

104
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,360
which made it even more difficult 
for people to recognize him.

105
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,000
The old lady who owned the hotel was excited 
about the coronation like everybody else.

106
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:05,200
'Prince Rudolf is here in Zenda!' she 
told me. 'He's staying near the castle.  

107
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,400
He'll travel from Zenda to Strelsau 
on the day of the coronation.

108
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,840
Suddenly she looked very serious.

109
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,120
'It's a pity,' she told me.  

110
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:25,520
'The Duke's a good man - he'd be a very 
good king for Ruritania. Prince Rudolf's'

111
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,480
-'Mother!' one of the old lady's daughters cried. 
She was angry. 'The Duke's a bad man, you know  

112
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:40,080
that. I want Prince Rudolf to be king. He's a 
real Elphberg, with red hair and a long nose.'

113
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,880
'Are the Prince and the Duke good 
friends?' I asked the old lady.

114
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,960
'No,' the old lady's daughter said. 'They  

115
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,120
hate each other really. They're both in 
love with the same girl, Princess Flavia.'

116
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,640
'Be quiet!' the old lady commanded 
her. She turned to me with a smile.

117
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,080
'You mustn't take what she says seriously, sir,' 
she told me. 'The Duke and the Prince are the  

118
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,840
best of friends. The Duke is helping the 
Prince to prepare for the coronation.'

119
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,920
'You know that's not true!' 
the old lady's daughter  

120
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,840
interrupted once again. 'The Duke 
hates Prince Rudolf. Black Michael -'

121
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,680
The door of the room opened and a man came 
in. He looked very angrily at the girl.

122
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,360
'I've told you before not to 
call him 'Black Michael','  

123
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,880
he shouted angrily. 'He's the Duke of Strelsau!'

124
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,840
The man saw me in the room now 
and he was suddenly silent.  

125
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,440
He seemed shocked for a moment. 
The old lady explained who I was.

126
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,960
'This is Mr. Rassendyll,' she said. 'He's come 
from England to see the Prince's coronation.'

127
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,280
She turned politely to me.

128
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,800
'This is Johann,' she said. 'Fie 
works for the Duke of Strelsau.'

129
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,840
The man was still silent. He stared at me in a  

130
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,320
very strange way. I did not 
understand what was troubling him.

131
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,960
The girl began to laugh.

132
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,400
'You've got red hair, sir,' she 
said to me. 'He doesn't like  

133
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,600
red hair. It's the Prince's colour, you see.'

134
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,640
The man laughed.

135
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,960
'I'm sorry, sir,' he said. 'You look -'

136
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,840
He was silent again and then 
he said, 'You surprised me.  

137
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,840
I didn't know anyone was staying in the hotel.'
 
 
 

138
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,880
CHAPTER THREE

139
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,600
The Cousins Rudolf

140
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,760
I went for a walk in the forest the next 
morning. I walked near the castle. The  

141
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:01,040
old part was very imposing and still in good 
condition. I noticed that it stood on an island,  

142
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:08,960
and there was a moat full of water surrounding 
it. The water looked deep and cold. On the  

143
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:16,400
other side of the moat there was an elegant modern 
chateau, the country home of the Duke of Strelsau.  

144
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:25,280
I walked for a long time. I decided to lie down 
and rest for a while. I fell asleep in the forest.

145
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:34,000
I dreamt I was married to Princess Flavia and we 
lived in the castle of Zenda. I was about to kiss  

146
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,400
the Princess when I heard someone say, 'This man 
looks just like the Prince except for his beard.'

147
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,760
I opened my eyes and saw two men 
looking at me with great curiosity.

148
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,840
Then the other man said, 'He's the same height 
as the Prince, as well. Really, it's very odd!'

149
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:02,160
I stood up now and looked at the two men. One 
of them was quite an old man. He had a square  

150
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,680
head and a grey moustache, and he looked serious. 
The other one was young. He had dark skin,  

151
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,840
and he seemed friendlier than the 
older man. The young man smiled at me.

152
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,040
'What's your name?' he asked politely.

153
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,760
'Rassendyll' I told him. 'Rudolf Rassendyll.'

154
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,040
'I'm Fritz von Tarlenheim,' he said.  

155
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,080
He pointed at the older man. 'And this is Colonel 
Sapt,' he told me. 'We work for the Prince.'

156
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,200
Colonel Sapt smiled at me now.

157
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,320
'So you're a Rassendyll,' he said happily.  

158
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,760
'You know the old story about the Prince of 
Ruritania and the Countess Amelia, I suppose?'

159
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,040
I smiled as well.

160
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,440
'I know the story very well,' I told him.

161
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,480
There was a noise behind some 
trees, and a man began to shout.

162
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,040
'Fritz! Fritz! Where are you?'

163
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,840
'It's the Prince,' Fritz von 
Tarlenheim said. 'He's calling me.'

164
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:19,360
Now the man came forward. I looked at him in 
great surprise. He looked at me in great surprise.  

165
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,920
Prince Rudolf of Ruritania and Rudolf Rassendyll 
looked the same - except for my beard.

166
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,680
I studied the Prince carefully. 
The likeness was remarkable.  

167
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:41,200
He was a little shorter than me, and his face 
was a little fatter than mine. I also noticed  

168
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,240
that his mouth did not look as determined as 
mine. But for all that, we were nearly identical!

169
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,160
For a moment no one spoke. Then the 
Prince turned to Fritz and Colonel Sapt.

170
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,400
Colonel Sapt whispered 
something in the Prince's ear.  

171
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:08,480
The Prince listened carefully, and then he 
began to smile. Suddenly he laughed very loudly.

172
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:17,920
'We're cousins!' he said to me. I'm very pleased 
to know you, cousin,' he added. 'Come and dine  

173
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,120
with me tonight. We'll talk of old times together. 
And you will stay at my house tonight, of course.'

174
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,760
Colonel Sapt stepped forward to speak 
to the Prince again. He spoke seriously.

175
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:39,760
'The coronation is tomorrow morning, sir,' 
he said. 'There is a lot to do before then.  

176
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,680
We have a lot of things to talk about. It's not 
the evening for a dinner with Mr. Rassendyll.'

177
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,880
Prince Rudolf looked angrily at Colonel Sapt. He 
did not seem pleased with the Colonel's advice.

178
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,920
'I want to dine with Mr. 
Rassendyll!' he said crossly,  

179
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,960
i want to drink wine with him. He's my cousin 
- and I don't meet a new cousin every day.

180
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,600
That is how I came to dine with Prince Rudolf.  

181
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,040
We ate well, and we drank a lot of wine. 
Prince Rudolf drank more wine than anyone else.  

182
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,880
He was very happy because of 
the wine. It was a long dinner.

183
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,840
I thought the evening was 
finished, but I was wrong.  

184
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,320
The servant, Joseph, brought 
another bottle of wine to the table.

185
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,680
'This bottle comes from the Duke of Strelsau,' 
he told Prince Rudolf. 'He told me to give  

186
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,840
you this message: "Drink this wine because you 
love me." That's what he told me to say, sir.'

187
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,120
'What a good brother Michael is!' Prince Rudolf 
cried joyfully. 'I'll certainly drink his wine.'

188
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,520
He reached for the bottle and 
poured a glass of the wine.  

189
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,760
He drank the glass quickly. Then he put 
his head on the table and fell asleep.

190
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,920
Nobody else touched the wine 
from the Duke of Strelsau.

191
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,800
I looked at Fritz von Tarlenheim and Colonel Sapt.  

192
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,480
I did not say anything, but the Prince 
of Ruritania was a disappointment to me.  

193
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:28,160
He seemed a selfish young man - a selfish young 
man who was too fond of wine. I remember nothing  

194
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:35,040
else about that evening. I, too, had drunk 
too much wine. I fell asleep at the table.
 
 
 

195
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,400
CHAPTER FOUR

196
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,960
The Game Begins

197
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,200
I woke suddenly the next 
morning. Someone had thrown  

198
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,560
water over me! I opened my eyes angrily 
and looked up at Fritz and the Colonel.

199
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,200
'That wasn't a good joke!' I said angrily.

200
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,560
'Be quiet,' Colonel Sapt ordered 
angrily. 'We had to wake you up.  

201
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,080
There's something wrong.' He pointed to the floor.  

202
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:16,000
The Prince was lying there. 'The Prince is still 
sleeping. We've tried to wake him, but we can't.'

203
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,400
'We think the Duke put something 
in that bottle of wine,'  

204
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Fritz explained. 'Something that 
will make the Prince sleep all day.'

205
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,920
'It's a crisis for Ruritania,' Colonel 
Sapt said. 'The coronation is this morning.  

206
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,840
If Prince Rudolf does not go to 
Strelsau today, he'll never be king!'

207
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,320
'What do you mean?' I asked.

208
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,800
'The Duke wants to be king,' Colonel 
Sapt told me. 'Prince Rudolf is not  

209
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,720
popular. I think the Duke will seize the crown!'

210
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,640
'What are you going to do about it?' I asked him.

211
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,320
'There's only one chance,' Colonel Sapt explained.  

212
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,120
'The coronation is today. Prince Rudolf 
must go to Strelsau this morning!'

213
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,200
'But if he's asleep - ' I began.

214
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,600
'You can go,' Colonel Sapt said. 'You 
can be Prince Rudolf for the day.'

215
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,840
'Me!' I cried. 'But that's ridiculous. I 
don't know how to behave like a prince.  

216
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,520
I can't pretend to be the Prince of Ruritania!'

217
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:30,560
'You look like the Prince, except for 
your beard,' Colonel Sapt said slowly.  

218
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,240
'You can do it. Rassendyll, I know you can.'

219
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,560
I did not say anything.

220
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,360
'If you don't do it, the Duke will 
be the next King of Ruritania,'  

221
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,600
Colonel Sapt went on. 'And 
he'll kill Prince Rudolf.'

222
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,920
Then I decided. I was young and 
I liked excitement and adventure.

223
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,600
'Very well,' I told the Colonel. 'I'll 
help you. I'll be the Prince for a day.'

224
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,880
'Well done!' the Colonel cried 
excitedly. He shook my hand.  

225
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,080
'There's a lot to do. Let's make a start.'

226
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,320
I got up and began to shave off my beard 
while the Colonel told me his plan.

227
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:25,280
'I'll hide the Prince in the wine-cellar,' he said 
excitedly. 'Then we all go to Strelsau together to  

228
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:34,400
the coronation, and you become King. Then we come 
back to Zenda. We wake the real King. He goes back  

229
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:42,480
to Strelsau with us the next day. And you, Mr. 
Rassendyll, you leave Ruritania very secretly.'  

230
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:50,720
He paused then he clapped his hands 
together. 'Yes! It's a good plan,' he cried.

231
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,040
The Colonel picked up the Prince and carried 
him to the door. He was very strong. He opened  

232
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:06,240
the door suddenly - and then stopped. Johann's 
mother was standing on the other side of the door.

233
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,440
'Was she listening?' Fritz asked quickly.

234
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,640
'I'll make sure she's quiet!' 
the Colonel said grimly.'The  

235
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,120
Colonel carried the Prince into the wine 
cellar. Then he came upstairs again and  

236
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,960
seized hold of Johann's mother. He put a 
handkerchief in her mouth and tied her up.  

237
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,200
Then he carried her down to a 
coal-cellar and locked her in.

238
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,880
Then Colonel Sapt, Fritz and 
I continued to make our plans.

239
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,560
'No one will ever know,' Fritz 
said. 'It'll work - and you'll  

240
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,680
save Ruritania from disaster, Mr. Rassendyll.'

241
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,840
'All we've got to do is hide the real 
Prince while we're all in Strelsau,'  

242
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,120
the Colonel said. 'Fritz and I will do that 
while you're getting ready, Mr. Rassendyll.  

243
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,240
Joseph will guard him while we're away.'

244
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,840
Colonel Sapt hurried out of the room to make 
all the arrangements with the servant.
 
 
 

245
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,880
CHAPTER FIVE

246
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,520
Coronation of a King

247
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,840
It was now six o'clock in the morning. I 
dressed in one of Prince Rudolf's uniforms.  

248
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,600
Colonel Sapt, Fritz and I took our 
horses and rode towards Strelsau.

249
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,520
It was a beautiful ride that early 
morning, and I will never forget it.  

250
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,280
The Colonel gave me advice about how 
to behave when we reached Strelsau.  

251
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,520
He told me about the things that Prince 
Rudolf liked, and the things he did not like.

252
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,440
'Don't worry,' he said. I'll stand next to 
you all the time. I'll tell you what to say.'

253
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:00,400
We reached the railway station at eight o'clock. 
At nine - thirty we were in the capital city.

254
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,240
'Are you frightened?' Colonel Sapt asked me.

255
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,200
'Don't worry about me,' I told him. I'll manage.'

256
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,640
'I think you will,' the Colonel replied. 
'You're a real Elphberg, Mr. Rassendyll.'

257
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,360
When we got off the train, the people surrounded 
us. They were excited to see their Prince in front  

258
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:30,080
of them. They began to cheer and shout. Soon 
the station was full of noise and shouting.  

259
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,520
A party of important people were waiting for us.  

260
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,960
The commander of the Ruritanian 
army, an important-looking marshal,  

261
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,080
was also there with some soldiers. We 
all rode towards the cathedral together.

262
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,720
First we rode through the new part of 
Strelsau. The Colonel told me that the  

263
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,320
people in this part of the city were loyal 
to Prince Rudolf. They wanted him to be king.  

264
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,640
The crowds in the street cheered as we rode past. 
Suddenly I looked up at one of the buildings.  

265
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:13,200
Antoinette De Mauban was standing in the window 
watching the procession. For a moment I was very  

266
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,520
nervous. I was sure she would recognize me and 
tell everyone that I was not the real Prince.  

267
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,560
She did not do anything, however.

268
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,680
Then we rode through the old part of the 
city. The people in this part of Strelsau  

269
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:36,000
did not like Prince Rudolf. They wanted his 
brother, the Duke of Strelsau, to be king.  

270
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,720
The marshal made a sign to the 
soldiers who were riding with us.  

271
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,560
He wanted them to stay close to me. He 
wanted them to protect me from the crowd.

272
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,680
I decided that a real prince would be a brave man.

273
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,840
'Why did you tell the soldiers to ride 
close to me?' I asked the marshal.

274
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
'For your safety, sir,' the marshal replied.

275
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm not afraid,' I told the marshal. 
'I'll ride in front of the soldiers.  

276
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,840
I'm not afraid of my own people!'

277
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,480
Colonel Sapt put a hand on my arm. 
He did not like what I was doing.

278
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,160
'I'll ride in front,' I repeated. 'Tell 
the soldiers to go away, marshal.'

279
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,240
I rode out in front of the soldiers.  

280
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,560
For a few moments I felt like a real 
king. It was a wonderful feeling.

281
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,640
Soon we arrived at the cathedral. It was a 
splendid building, and it was full of people.  

282
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,600
Everyone was wearing their best clothes 
for the coronation of their king.  

283
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,800
I do not remember much about the ceremony. 
It was long, and Colonel Sapt stood very  

284
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,480
close to me throughout it. He whispered 
to me all the time, telling me what to do.

285
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,600
I saw Prince Rudolf's brother, the Duke 
of Strelsau, in the cathedral. He was very  

286
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,160
surprised to see me - he looked quite ill for 
a moment! He looked at me as if he had seen  

287
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:21,040
a ghost. I also saw a beautiful young woman. 
Colonel Sapt told me she was Princess Flavia.  

288
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:29,680
She was the most beautiful woman I had ever 
seen. She had the red hair of the Elphbergs.

289
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,000
The coronation was a great success. No one 
recognized that I was not the real Prince Rudolf.  

290
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,600
When it was over Fritz, Colonel 
Sapt and I went to the palace.  

291
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,720
We laughed and joked together. 
The day had gone well for us.

292
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,000
I did think about the real 
Prince Rudolf - or King Rudolf,  

293
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,920
as he now was. I wondered what he was doing.
 
 
 

294
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,880
CHAPTER SIX

295
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,040
Kingship and Love

296
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,920
Colonel Sapt and I waited in the 
palace until very late that night.  

297
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,040
We talked together about the ceremony, 
and about the Duke of Strelsau.

298
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,520
'He's a dangerous man,' the Colonel told me.  

299
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,400
'But we've defeated him this time 
- thanks to you, Mr. Rassendyll.'

300
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,960
At last everyone was asleep. 
We went outside to the stables.  

301
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,480
We found our horses, and put on their saddles.

302
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,000
'Let's go,' the Colonel said quietly.

303
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,520
We jumped on the horses and 
rode out of the palace grounds.  

304
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,440
It was exciting to ride through the sleeping city.

305
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,280
We rode all night on our way back to Zenda.  

306
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,960
Suddenly we heard two horses following us in 
the darkness - the Duke and one of his men!  

307
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,600
We rode on very quickly and managed to 
lose them at a cross-roads in a forest.

308
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,400
We arrived at Zenda very early in the morning.  

309
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,280
We went straight to the house - and 
there we found a terrible tragedy.  

310
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,040
At first there seemed to be no one in the 
house. Then we saw some blood coming from  

311
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:33,920
under the locked door of the wine - cellar, where 
we had left the King. Perhaps the King was dead!  

312
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:42,160
We opened the door to the room. The servant 
Joseph was lying there - he was dead.  

313
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,120
We looked everywhere for the 
King, but we could not find him.

314
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,720
'The Duke of Strelsau!' the Colonel said 
angrily. 'He's been here.' He pointed  

315
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,320
at the body of the servant on the floor. 
'This is the Duke's work!' he exclaimed.

316
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,840
'But where's the King?' I asked. 'Do 
you think the Duke has killed him, too?'

317
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,800
'No,' the Colonel replied. 'I think the 
King is a prisoner in his brother's castle.'

318
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,360
'What do we do?' I asked.

319
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,520
'Everything's changed now,' the Colonel said 
thoughtfully. 'We must change our original plan.'

320
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,000
He thought for a moment.

321
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,960
'Ruritania needs her King,' he 
told me. 'You will have to be  

322
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,480
the King for a while longer, Mr. Rassendyll.'

323
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,640
'You want me to go back to Strelsau?' I asked.  

324
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,480
'But what about the real King? 
What will happen to him?'

325
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,800
'You're the only King we've got,' the Colonel 
said grimly. 'Go back to Strelsau, Mr Rassendyll.  

326
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,320
You are the King of Ruritania again.'

327
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,720
'But the Duke of Strelsau knows that I'm not 
the real King,' I said. 'He knows I'm a fake!'

328
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,560
'That's true,' the Colonel admitted. 
'He knows you're not the real King,  

329
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:16,720
because the real King is his prisoner in the 
castle here at Zenda. But the Duke can't tell  

330
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,600
anyone that you're a fake. He can't tell anyone 
that the real King is a prisoner, can he?'

331
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,840
I nodded my head. The Colonel was right.

332
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,160
'Do you think the King is in danger?' 
I asked. 'Will the Duke kill him?'

333
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,120
Colonel Sapt looked at me 
very seriously for a moment.

334
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:48,160
The King's life is in great danger,' he said 
slowly. 'The Duke has already killed once.  

335
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:57,280
But if he does kill the King,' he went on, 'you'll 
have to stay here. You're an Elphberg, after all!'

336
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,520
Colonel Sapt and I went outside to our horses.  

337
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,120
We rode back to the capital. 
No one saw us enter the palace.

338
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,480
The next day the Colonel and 
Fritz told me more about the King.

339
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,080
'Do you remember Princess Flavia?' the 
Colonel asked me. 'She was at the coronation.'

340
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:28,320
I remembered her very well. She was the 
beautiful girl I had noticed in the cathedral.

341
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,080
'The King's in love with 
her,' Colonel Sapt told me.

342
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:40,160
'Princess Flavia is very popular with the 
people. Everyone hopes the King will marry her.'

343
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,280
Fritz looked impatiently at Colonel Sapt. 
He was young and very loyal to the King.  

344
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:55,360
He always wanted to be busy, to be doing something 
to help the King. The older man was also very  

345
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,840
loyal to the King, but he knew how to wait, how 
to be patient until the time for action came.

346
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,960
'When are we going to rescue the King?'  

347
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,840
he asked impatiently. 'We can't sit 
here in the palace forever, Colonel!'

348
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:17,040
'We must be patient' Colonel Sapt told 
him. 'The Duke won't kill the King while  

349
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:25,760
Mr. Rassendyll is here pretending to be the King. 
He'll wait and see what we do. We must wait, too'

350
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,680
'You know that some of the Six are 
here in Strelsau?' Fritz asked.

351
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,760
The Colonel nodded.

352
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,400
'Yes,' he replied. 'The Duke sent 
them here to spy on Mr. Rassendyll'

353
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
'Who are the Six?' I said.

354
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,520
'They're the Duke's favorite soldiers' Fritz 
told me. 'They're the most dangerous men in  

355
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,400
the country, and they're very loyal to the 
Duke. They do everything he tells them to.'

356
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,160
'Three of them are Ruritanians' the Colonel 
explained. 'There's also a Frenchman,  

357
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:10,160
a Belgian and an Englishman. But the most 
dangerous of the Six is Rupert Hentzau.'

358
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,000
The three of us talked for a long time.  

359
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Fritz and I wanted to do something to help the 
King, but Colonel Sapt told us to be patient.  

360
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,600
He said we could do nothing until 
we knew what the Duke was planning.

361
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:32,320
'Be patient, my friends,' he said. 
The time for action will come soon."

362
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,920
'Very well,' I agreed. 'We'll do nothing 
until you tell us, Colonel. But meanwhile,  

363
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,640
I'm the King of Ruritania. Let's 
enjoy ourselves this evening!'

364
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,040
We all went out that evening 
to visit Princess Flavia.  

365
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,160
Fritz told me that he was in love with one 
of the Princess's ladies - in -waiting.

366
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,760
'Countess Helga is very beautiful,' he 
said. 'We'll see her when we arrive.'

367
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,840
Princess Flavia was very happy to see me. She 
did not realize that I was not the real King.  

368
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,520
She seemed worried about something, though, 
and I asked her what was the matter.

369
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,040
'It's your brother,' she said. 'I think Michael 
is dangerous. Please be careful. Your Majesty!'

370
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,120
'I'm not frightened of Michael,' I told her.

371
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,240
She looked at me very seriously.

372
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,120
'Your life is important to 
Ruritania,' she told me.  

373
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,920
'And to your friends, as well,' 
she added with a tender look.

374
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:46,160
I began to fall in love with Princess 
Flavia that evening. It was difficult  

375
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,000
for me not to tell her the truth. I 
wanted to tell her who I really was.  

376
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:01,280
But I was playing a dangerous game - and the 
King's life depended on me. I kept silent.
 
 
 

377
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,200
CHAPTER SEVEN

378
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,160
A Dangerous Meeting

379
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,600
The next morning Colonel Sapt came into 
my room at the palace. He was carrying a  

380
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,720
letter for me. He looked at the writing on 
the envelope before he gave me the letter.

381
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,640
'From a woman, I think,' he said 
with a smile. 'I wonder who it is?'

382
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,480
At first I thought the letter was from Princess 
Flavia. I opened it excitedly and began to read.
 
 

383
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,160
'Your Majesty,

384
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,680
I have important news for the King. Come 
to the old house in New Avenue tonight.  

385
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,720
Do not come with anyone 
else. Antoinette De Mauban'
 
 

386
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,400
I handed the letter to the 
Colonel. He read it quickly.

387
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,600
'You can't go.' he decided. 
'Antoinette De Mauban is a  

388
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,080
friend of the Duke's. They want 
to catch you alone and kill you.'

389
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:12,800
'I must go,' I argued. 'She says she has 
important news. Perhaps she wants to help us.'

390
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,360
'I forbid it,' the Colonel said 
angrily. 'The Duke's men will  

391
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,400
kill you if you go to this meeting tonight.'

392
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,560
'I'm going,' I announced firmly. 'If you try 
to stop me, I'll go straight back to England!'

393
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,560
Colonel Sapt looked at me in surprise.  

394
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,320
He was beginning to understand me. 
We Rassendylls can be very stubborn!

395
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:45,280
'All right,' he agreed at last, 'you can go if you 
want to - but I'm going with you, Mr. Rassendyll!'

396
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,440
The Colonel and I left the palace very secretly 
that night. We were both carrying pistols in  

397
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,920
our pockets. We went to the old house in New 
Avenue and I left Colonel Sapt at the gate.  

398
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,040
I entered the grounds of the house, 
and saw someone in the summerhouse.

399
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,800
I walked across the garden to the summerhouse.  

400
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:16,320
Antoinette De Mauban turned to greet me when 
I entered. She was very pale and nervous.

401
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:23,600
'You're in danger, Mr. Rassendyll,' she told me 
quickly. 'Michael forced me to write that letter  

402
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:30,000
to you. I didn't want to do it. His men will be 
here in a few minutes. They want to kill you.  

403
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,600
Then they're going to say the King is 
dead. They'll arrest all your friends,  

404
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,720
and Michael will be the new King. You 
must escape from here. Go quickly!'

405
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,400
I did not move.

406
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,040
'Why are you telling me this?' I asked 
her. 'Michael's your friend, isn't he?'

407
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,520
She looked at me unhappily.

408
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,560
'I love him,' she said sadly. 'But I know 
he'll marry Princess Flavia if he becomes  

409
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,920
King. That's why I'm helping you, Mr. Rassendyll.'

410
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:09,520
Suddenly I heard a noise outside in the garden. 
I turned towards the door of the summerhouse and  

411
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:18,080
locked it. I could see three men standing outside 
in the garden - three of theSix! One of them  

412
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,440
began speaking softly in English. 
It was the Duke's man, Detchard.

413
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,640
'We just want to talk,' he said. 
'We've come from Duke Michael.  

414
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,840
He wants to make you an offer, Mr. Rassendyll.'

415
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,800
'What kind of an offer?' I asked.

416
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,520
'The Duke wants you out of 
the country,' the man said.  

417
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,280
'He'll give you fifty thousand 
pounds if you leave Ruritania.'

418
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:51,760
Antoinette De Mauban moved close 
to me. She put her hand on my arm.

419
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,840
'Don't trust them,' she whispered urgently.

420
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,040
I moved very quietly away from the door of the 
summerhouse. I picked up a small tea table.

421
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,360
'All right,' I called. 'I'm coming out now.'

422
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,040
I held the tea table in front of me and 
ran out of the summerhouse into the garden.  

423
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,240
I pushed two of the Duke's men onto the 
ground as I ran past them. Then I heard  

424
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:25,040
Detchard shouting. He fired a pistol at me, 
but it missed. I turned and fired my pistol.  

425
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,920
He gave a cry of pain. I continued running.

426
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,320
Colonel Sapt was waiting for 
me when I reached the road.

427
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,040
'What happened?' he asked. 'I thought 
you were dead when I heard the shooting.'

428
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,440
We went back to the palace. When we arrived,  

429
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,840
I told him everything that had 
happened in the summerhouse.
 
 
 

430
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,920
CHAPTER EIGHT

431
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,000
A King's Love

432
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,560
The days that followed were very difficult for me.  

433
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,880
I saw Princess Flavia very often. Each 
time I saw her I loved her more. She, too,  

434
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,800
seemed to love me more each time we met. I 
remember that there was a ball one night,  

435
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,040
and I gave Princess Flavia a red rose. I behaved 
like all young men when they are in love.

436
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,840
'You're different, Rudolf,' she told me once. 'You 
changed when you became King. You're a new man!'

437
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:37,360
I wanted to tell her who I really was. I wanted 
to tell her that I was not the King of Ruritania.  

438
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:43,200
I wanted her to love Rudolf 
Rassendyll, not the King of Ruritania!

439
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,840
Sometimes I imagined the future.

440
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,640
'Will I always have to pretend to be the King?  

441
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,840
Will I marry Princess Flavia? 
Will she become my queen?'

442
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,000
One day she and I were talking. She said to me,  

443
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,360
'You are the King. Why can't you be an ordinary 
man? Then I'd show you how much I love you!'

444
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,560
'Would you really love me if I 
were an ordinary man, Princess?'  

445
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,600
I asked. 'Do you love me that much?'

446
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,560
'Of course I do,' she said.

447
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,320
Her words made me very happy. I decided that 
I could not go on lying to her any more.  

448
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,080
I loved her. I wanted to tell 
her the whole truth about myself  

449
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,760
and the King of Ruritania. I decided to speak.

450
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,040
'Princess,' I began. 'I want 
to tell you something. I am -'

451
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,680
Just at that moment the door of the room opened 
and Colonel Sapt came in. He looked angrily at me.

452
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,920
'Forgive me, sir,' he said. 'I need to 
talk to you about something important.'

453
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,000
'One moment, Princess,' I said.

454
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,840
I left the room and followed Colonel 
Sapt. He was furious with me.

455
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:12,000
'I heard everything you said,' he told 
me. 'You were going to tell her the truth.  

456
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,920
Be careful,' he warned me. 'The King's 
life is in your hands, Mr. Rassendyll.'

457
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,960
Princess Flavia was not the only 
person who liked the new King.  

458
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,680
The people seemed happy with me, as well. I 
was becoming popular as the King of Ruritania.  

459
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,800
I spoke about this to Colonel Sapt one 
evening when we were alone together.

460
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,160
'You know, Colonel,' I said, 'I'm a good king.  

461
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,080
The people like me. I could stay here and pretend 
to be the King forever. No one could stop me.'

462
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,400
The Colonel smiled.

463
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:56,880
'It's true,' he agreed. 'No one could stop you. 
But I know you're a man of honor, Mr. Rassendyll.  

464
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,800
I know you'll help us to find the real King.  

465
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:08,320
And then you'll have to leave the country. 
There can't be two Rudolfs in Ruritania!'

466
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,160
I sighed deeply. The Colonel was right.

467
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,920
'I promised to help the King,' I said, 'and I 
will help him. I'll help him even if - even if -'

468
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,760
'Even if the real King marries Princess 
Flavia?' the Colonel asked gently.

469
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,720
'Even that,' I replied. 'The 
Princess will marry the King.  

470
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,840
It's her duty, Colonel. You know that.'
 
 
 

471
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,200
CHAPTER NINE

472
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,200
Return to Zenda

473
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,600
At last Colonel Sapt decided that the 
time was right for rescuing the real King.

474
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,760
'We'll go to Zenda together,' 
the Colonel explained.  

475
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,440
'We'll tell everyone that we're going hunting 
I there. No one will suspect anything.'

476
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,200
We took ten soldiers with us. The 
soldiers did not know the real truth.  

477
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,640
They thought I was the King. The 
Colonel told them I was in danger.  

478
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,160
He said someone had tried to kill 
me in the summerhouse in New Avenue.

479
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,800
We stayed in Zenda for a few days while the 
Colonel made his plans to get inside the castle.  

480
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:25,760
One afternoon I was sitting in the garden of the 
house, when Rupert Hentzau rode up to the house.  

481
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:33,600
He waved at me and smiled cheerfully. Then he 
got down from his horse and came into the garden.

482
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,920
'I've come with another offer 
from the Duke,' he said.

483
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,600
'I don't want to hear it,' I told him.

484
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:46,000
The Duke will give you one million crowns if you 
leave Ruritania,' Rupert said. 'What do you say?'

485
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,400
'No,' I replied coldly.

486
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,600
'I thought you'd say that,' Rupert told me 
with a smile. 'I told the Duke it was no good.  

487
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,040
You're a gentleman, Mr. Rassendyll 
- but you're a fool as well!'

488
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:04,800
I said nothing, and we looked at each other for a 
few minutes in silence. Then Rupert spoke again.

489
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,200
'Listen to me,' he said. 'You could really 
be the King of Ruritania, if you want.  

490
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,640
My friends and I will help you. Being 
king is fun, isn't it, Mr Rassendyll?  

491
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,920
And the King will marry 
Princess Flavia, won't lie?'

492
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,000
I still said nothing.

493
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,880
'We'll help you, and you help us,' he went on. 
'I want to be the Duke of Strelsau. I like the  

494
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:33,040
Duke's castle - and I like his lady as well,' 
he laughed. 'Antoinette De Mauban's a beauty!'

495
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,200
No,' I said again. 'I promised to help 
the King - and I'll keep my promise.'

496
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,320
'I like you, Rassendyll,' Rupert 
said. He spoke in a friendly way.  

497
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,560
'I don't want to be your enemy. Shake my 
hand before I go. You're a brave man.'

498
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:57,840
He put out his hand for me to shake. He was 
smiling. Suddenly he took out a dagger from  

499
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:05,200
his coat. He stabbed me in the arm with the 
dagger. I cried out in pain and the soldiers  

500
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,840
ran into the garden. Rupert Hentzau 
jumped onto his horse and rode away.

501
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,880
The soldiers carried me into the house and 
put me to bed. My arm was very painful.

502
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:29,280
That evening Fritz came to the house to see me. 
He brought someone with him. I recognized Johann,  

503
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,360
the old man from the hotel in Zenda. I remembered 
that Johann worked for the Duke of Strelsau.  

504
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,320
The three of us talked together, 
and Johann agreed to work with us.  

505
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:46,560
He knew the King was a prisoner in the 
castle. He was afraid of the Duke, he told us.  

506
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,320
Johann told us that the King was 
still alive but he was very ill.

507
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,760
'He'll die soon,' Johann told us.

508
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,800
There are two secret rooms 
in the castle,' he explained.  

509
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,640
They're holding the King in one of the rooms. 
Two members of the Six are in the other room.  

510
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,160
The Duke has told them to kill the 
King if anyone tries to rescue him.'

511
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,240
'What will they do with the 
King's body?' I asked him.  

512
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,840
'If they kill him, we'll find his body. 
Everybody will know the Duke's a murderer then.'

513
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,560
They've got a plan,' Johann told me. 'There's 
a metal pipe that goes from the room where  

514
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:34,320
they're keeping him, down into the moat. When 
they kill the King, they're going to throw  

515
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:40,800
the body into the castle moat. The Duke's 
men will slide down the pipe into the moat  

516
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:47,840
and swim away. There'll be no evidence of the 
murder. No one will ever find the King's body.'

517
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,720
I knew that we had to do something to 
save the King. Suddenly I had an idea.

518
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,840
'Listen, Johann,' I said, 'I want you to help 
us to enter the castle. Will you do that?'

519
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,640
'Yes, sir,' the old man replied.

520
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,120
'Good,' I said. 'Open the castle 
gate tomorrow night at two o'clock.'

521
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,440
'What do I do then?' the old man asked nervously.

522
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:21,120
'Nothing,' I told him. 'Open the castle 
gate, and then go away. Leave the castle.'

523
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,320
'Very well,' he agreed. 'I'll do it.'

524
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,720
I gave Johann a letter for Antoinette De 
Mauban. I told her to make a noise at two  

525
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:37,440
o'clock the next night. I wanted her to 
shout for help. I wanted the Duke to go  

526
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,240
to her room when she cried for help. Then 
we could enter the castle through the gate.

527
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,560
The next night I hid near the castle and watched.  

528
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,840
It was very dark, and the castle 
seemed huge against the sky.
 
 
 

529
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,840
CHAPTER TEN

530
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,360
Rescue

531
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,160
When it was nearly two o'clock 
I entered the castle moat.  

532
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,160
The water was cold. I swam to the metal pipe  

533
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:13,120
under the King's cell. It was very close to 
Antoinette De Mauban's room in the castle.

534
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:20,240
I looked up at the castle. There was a light 
in Antoinette De Mauban's room. There was a  

535
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:27,760
man in the room with her. It was Rupert Hentzau. 
They were arguing about something. I saw Rupert  

536
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:34,160
approach her, and she walked away from him. 
I heard her say angrily, 'Never! You're mad.'

537
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,560
'Forget Black Michael,' Rupert told 
her. 'I'm a better man than he is.'

538
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,480
He moved forward again and tried 
to kiss Antoinette De Mauban.  

539
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:48,320
She pushed him away angrily. Then I heard 
someone come into the room. It was the Duke!

540
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,560
'Leave us alone' he ordered Rupert. 
Rupert smiled cruelly and left the room.  

541
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,200
A few minutes later the Duke also 
left Antoinette De Mauban's room.

542
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,800
The castle was now dark. I was 
waiting for Johann to open the gate  

543
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,840
when there was a terrible scream 
from Antoinette De Mauban's room.

544
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:17,120
'Help, Michael!' she cried, it's Hentzau, help 
me!' I could not see anything, but I heard it  

545
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:22,640
all. First there was the sound of a man running 
towards Antoinette De Mauban's room - the Duke.

546
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:32,480
Then I heard the noise of swords. Rupert and the 
Duke were fighting. One man called out in pain,  

547
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,520
and there was silence. The window opened,  

548
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:44,640
and I saw Rupert standing there. He had 
killed the Duke of Strelsau! Then more men  

549
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,840
rushed into the room. They attacked Rupert, but 
he jumped out of the window into the castle moat.

550
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,480
One of the Duke's men tried to follow Rupert. 
I grabbed him and killed him quickly and  

551
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,640
quietly. Then I searched his body 
for the keys to the King's cell.  

552
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:07,520
I took the keys and opened the door that led 
to the cell. I was now outside the King's cell.

553
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:16,160
There were two men with the King. They thought I 
was a friend. They opened the cell door. I ran in  

554
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,280
and attacked them. I killed one of them 
immediately. The other man, Detchard, ran  

555
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:27,360
towards the King with his sword. The King was weak 
and ill, and he stood in one corner of the cell.

556
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,360
I attacked Detchard before he could 
kill the King. He was a good swordsman,  

557
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,240
and we fought for a long time 
down there in the dark cell.  

558
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:44,160
Detchard was stronger than me, and I was in great 
danger. Suddenly the King recognised who I was.

559
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,920
'Cousin Rudolf!' he cried. 'I'll help you.'

560
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,560
He ran forward and picked up a chair. Then he 
pushed the chair against Detchard. Detchard turned  

561
00:52:54,560 --> 00:53:02,000
and wounded the King with his sword. The King fell 
to the floor. Then Detchard turned back to me,  

562
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:10,960
but he slipped on the blood from the King's wound. 
I killed him as he fell. The fight was over.

563
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:18,080
I helped the King to climb the steps into 
the castle. Then we saw a strange sight.  

564
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,440
There was a group of the Duke's 
men standing near Rupert Hentzau.  

565
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,480
Colonel Sapt and our soldiers were 
approaching Rupert from the other direction.  

566
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:33,440
Rupert looked at both groups of enemies and 
smiled. He did not seem afraid of danger.

567
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:40,480
Then I saw Antoinette De Mauban. She was 
standing in a door of the castle - and she  

568
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:47,600
was pointing a pistol at Rupert. She fired, 
but the bullet missed. Rupert turned to her  

569
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:54,160
and smiled. Then he looked once at the Duke's 
men and once at Colonel Sapt and the soldiers.

570
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:02,720
He ran to the wall and jumped into the 
castle moat once more. I jumped in after him,  

571
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:11,520
but he was a good swimmer. He swam to the other 
side quickly and climbed out. Then he began to run  

572
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,880
through the countryside. I ran after him, but 
he was faster than me. He suddenly turned to  

573
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:25,120
the right, and I could not see. Then I heard a 
scream - it was a woman's voice. I ran as fast  

574
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,960
as I could towards the sound. Then I saw Rupert. 
He was pulling a young girl off her horse.  

575
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,160
He pulled her to the ground, kissed 
her gently, and jumped onto the horse.

576
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,240
He rode up to me.

577
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,800
'What happened in the castle?' he asked.

578
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,480
eI killed three of your friends,' I told him.

579
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,920
'And the King?' he asked.

580
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,240
'The King is hurt,' I replied sternly,  

581
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,560
'but I think he will live. I 
killed your friend Detchard.'

582
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,680
'You're a fool!' Rupert said in a friendly way.

583
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:05,840
'One more thing,' I told him. 'I saved your life. 
I was behind you on the bridge with a pistol'

584
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,320
He looked at me in surprise.

585
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,400
'Now get off the horse' I said angrily. 
'Come and fight me like a man.'

586
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:21,280
I ran towards him and hit him. I was furious. 
He defended himself, and I think he would have  

587
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:27,360
killed me there and then, I except for a sudden 
noise. Someone was coming towards us on a horse.  

588
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,280
I turned and saw that it was 
Fritz. He was carrying a pistol.

589
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,040
Rupert looked at Fritz. He stopped fighting me.

590
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:40,560
'Au revoir, Rassendyll,' he 
said. Then he rode away laughing.

591
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,600
Back at the castle the King was now 
lying in Black Michael's own room.  

592
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:52,480
His men sent a message to Princess Flavia that 
he was safe. She now hurried to Zenda to see him.

593
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,800
The Princess immediately set 
out for Zenda in her carriage.  

594
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:04,080
She arrived just as Fritz and I were approaching 
the castle. Fritz gave me a sudden look. I  

595
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:10,240
understood that Princess Flavia must not see 
me. I hid behind some bushes - near the road.

596
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,280
Just at that moment the young 
girl whose horse Rupert had taken,  

597
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,560
came forward. She ran up to Princess Flavia.

598
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,360
'The King is here, Princess!' 
she cried. 'In the bushes.'

599
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,680
'Nonsense' one of the soldiers told 
her. 'The King is in the castle.'

600
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,120
'He's here, I tell you!' the girl 
cried. 'He's here with Count Fritz.'

601
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:40,400
'How can the King be in two places?' Princess 
Flavia asked. 'Or are there two kings?'

602
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,560
Colonel Sapt now appeared. He told the 
Princess that the King was in the castle.

603
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,240
'But this girl says he's here, in 
the bushes,' the Princess told him.

604
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,520
Colonel Sapt smiled at the girl.

605
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:02,640
'Every fine gentleman looks like a king 
to a simple girl like her,' he said.

606
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,720
'I'll see this man,' the Princess decided.

607
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,640
'Then come alone,' Colonel Sapt advised her.

608
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,680
A few minutes later Princess Flavia 
and the Colonel were standing over me.

609
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,960
'It is the King!' she cried excitedly.

610
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,440
She moved forward to kiss me.

611
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:28,960
'It is not the King,' Colonel Sapt told 
her. 'You cannot kiss this man, Princess.'

612
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:36,880
'Of course lie's the King!' Princess Flavia 
cried. 'It is the King's face - it is my love!'

613
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:44,080
'Your love. Princess,' the Colonel 
said slowly, 'but he is not the King.'

614
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,560
'Why do you let them torture me?' the 
Princess asked me. 'Tell me what it means.'

615
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,360
I looked at her sadly for a moment, then I spoke.

616
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,040
'I am not the King!' I said sadly.
 
 
 

617
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:08,720
Epilogue

618
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,040
That night I went to see the King. 
He thanked me for my loyalty.

619
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,560
'You have been a good and dear friend, cousin,' 
he told me. 'I will try to be a good king.  

620
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,720
You have shown me how a good king behaves.'

621
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,240
Fritz and I left the King. 
Fritz seemed in a hurry,  

622
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,000
and he led me quickly to 
another part of the building.

623
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,760
'Where are we going?' I asked him.

624
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,920
'We're going to see Princess Flavia,' he 
told me. 'She heard that the King was here,  

625
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,760
and she came to see him.'

626
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,240
He coughed awkwardly.

627
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:56,480
'Colonel Sapt has told her everything. 
She knows who you are now, Mr. Rassendyll'

628
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:03,840
'I see.' I said slowly, I 
wonder why she wants to see me.'

629
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:12,400
Fritz opened a door and pushed me into the room. 
He did not enter. The room was dark, and at first  

630
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:19,200
I thought I was alone. Then I saw the figure of a 
woman standing near the window. I approached her.

631
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,760
'Princess!' I said.

632
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,040
I bowed very low to her.

633
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,840
'No!' she cried. 'You must not bow to 
me, Rudolf - you're the man I love.'

634
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,200
'I love you,' I told her. I 
love you with all my heart.'

635
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,440
Princess Flavia looked at me 
tenderly, but she did not say a word.

636
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,640
'Perhaps I was wrong to pretend 
to be the King,' I said.  

637
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,280
'But I never lied about my love for you - never!'

638
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,840
'You were very brave to do what you did,' 
she told me. 'You saved the real King,  

639
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,240
and you had to pretend to me. I understand that.'

640
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:10,400
'I nearly told you the truth,' I explained. 'I 
wanted to, but the King's life was in danger.'

641
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,840
'What will you do now?' she asked me.

642
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,800
I'm going back to England 
tonight,' I said quietly.  

643
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,960
'I have to leave Ruritania now 
that the real King is safe.'

644
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,960
'I want to come with you!' 
Princess Flavia said desperately.

645
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:32,320
'Yes,' I said eagerly. 'Come with 
me. We'll be happy together, Flavia!'

646
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:40,240
She looked at me sadly, then she said 
gently, 'Love isn't the only thing, Rudolf.  

647
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,400
I also have my duty here in Ruritania.'

648
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,680
'I know,' I replied. 'I was wrong 
to ask you to come with me.'

649
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:57,840
'I believe in love. Rudolf,' the Princess 
went on. 'But I believe in honor, too. I know  

650
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:04,000
you believe in honor as well. You played this 
dangerous game because you believe in honor.'

651
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:13,600
'You're right,' I said. I felt that my heart 
was breaking. 'You must stay here in Ruritania,  

652
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,640
and I must go back to England. 
We'll never see each other again.'

653
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:27,760
The Princess kissed me, and I held her in my 
arms. It was the saddest moment of my life.

654
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:36,640
A few minutes later I was outside the castle with 
Fritz and Colonel Sapt. It was now early morning.  

655
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,840
We went to the railway station 
and waited for the train.

656
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:47,840
'We're tired,' I said. 'But we played our 
part like men, didn't we, my friends?'

657
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:53,280
'We defeated the enemy and saved 
Ruritania,' Sapt said proudly.

658
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,560
Fritz shook my hand warmly.

659
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,520
'The right man is not always 
the real king!' he said.

660
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,720
Soon the train arrived, and I 
found myself an empty carriage.  

661
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:15,280
I looked out of the window to wave goodbye to 
Fritz and Colonel Sapt. They both stood on the  

662
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:21,360
platform. They took their hats off their 
heads and bowed to me with great respect.  

663
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:33,840
They stood like that until the train 
was a long way from the station.

664
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,840
That was the end of my Ruritanian adventure.  

665
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,360
A few months later Princess Flavia 
married the King. It was her duty.

666
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:02,320
I settled into a quiet life in England. I never 
married. I often wonder what happened to Rupert  

667
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:09,040
Hentzau. Sometimes I think he will return 
to Ruritania one day, and make more trouble  

668
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:15,840
for the King. Then, who knows, I will go 
back there to help the Elphbergs again!

669
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:22,720
I take a holiday in Dresden every year. I meet 
Fritz and his wife, the Countess Helga there.  

670
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:30,800
We spend a few days together. Every year Fritz 
carries a little box with him and gives it to me.  

671
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:39,760
There is a rose inside, and 
a note: "Rudolf - Flavia -  

672
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:57,840
always". Fritz carries a similar little box back 
to Ruritania with him after each holiday.
 
 
 
 
 
 

673
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,858
- THE END -
