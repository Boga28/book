by Antoine Galland

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,520
OPEN SESAME

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,000
Ali Baba was a woodcutter.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,960
He was from Persia, in the Middle East.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:29,560
One day he was at work in the woods when he saw forty men on
forty black horses.

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,440
They stopped near a huge rock.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,080
They had forty big, heavy, brown sacks on their backs.

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:47,880
Ali Baba watched the men as they got off their horses.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:58,600
A tall man walked to the rock and said "Open Sesame." Ali
Baba looked and looked again...

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,840
Something amazing happened... the rock opened!

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,200
Behind the rock was a cave.

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,640
The forty men went into the cave with their sacks.

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,760
Later, when the men came out of the cave, they didn't have
their sacks.

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:28,920
"Close Sesame," said the tall man, and the rock closed!

16
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,920
The forty men got on their horses and went away.

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,960
Ali Baba went to the rock.

18
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,840
"Open Sesame," he said.

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:50,840
The rock opened... and inside the cave there were hundreds
of sacks and wooden boxes.

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,760
Ali Baba opened a sack and... it was full of diamonds!

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,720
He opened another sack and... it was full of gold coins!

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,080
He opened a box and... it was full of silver!

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:16,800
He opened another box and... it was full of beautiful
jewels!

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,120
"These forty men are thieves," thought Ali.

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:27,760
"I'm going to take some of these coins home for my wife!"

26
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,720
He put some gold coins into his bag and went out of the
cave.

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,000
"Close Sesame," he said.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,040
The rock closed and he went home.

29
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,320
Ali Baba's wife, Nasreen, was in the kitchen.

30
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:55,840
Ali Baba told her about the forty thieves and the treasure
in the cave.

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,480
"This is wonderful news," said Nasreen.

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,720
"Can we take more money and buy a new house and new
clothes?"

33
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,120
"Yes, but we mustn't tell anyone," said Ali.

34
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,360
"The forty thieves are very dangerous men."

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,920
Ali's brother, Cassim, was outside the kitchen.

36
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,720
He opened the door.

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,640
"Tell me where the cave is!" he shouted.

38
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:41,161
"You must tell me or I'm going to go and look for it
myself!"

39
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:47,801
"No! Don't do that!" said Ali.

40
00:03:47,801 --> 00:04:03,481
"Go into the woods. There's a huge rock near the big baobab tree. The rock opens when you say "Open Sesame" and closes
when you say "Close Sesame".

41
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:12,601
Cassim went to the rock. "Open Sesame," he said. He went
into the cave and the rock closed.

42
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:22,321
"This is amazing," thought Cassim. "Gold, silver...
beautiful jewels!"

43
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:30,241
He had three big sacks with him and filled them with gold
and silver and jewels.

44
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:38,321
He stood in front of the rock and said "Open Wheat", but the
rock didn't open!

45
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:44,161
He said "Open Corn," but the rock didn't open!

46
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:49,201
"Oh! What is the right word?" he thought.

47
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,241
Cassim was angry.

48
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:54,281
He couldn't remember the word!

49
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:59,441
He sat down to think, but suddenly he heard horses.

50
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:02,601
The forty thieves were outside the cave!

51
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:04,121
Look!

52
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:05,001
A horse!

53
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:08,241
Someone's in our cave!

54
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:16,001
"He can't have our treasure! He must die!" said the tall
man.

55
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:21,761
The next morning Cassim's wife, Zhila, went to Ali Baba.

56
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:30,761
"Cassim didn't come home last night! Do you know where he
is?" she asked.

57
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:34,841
Ali told Zhila about the cave.

58
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:45,641
"Please go to the cave! The thieves are dangerous men.
They'll kill him!" she said.

59
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:48,601
Ali went to the rock.

60
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:53,001
It was closed but he heard a noise.

61
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:57,241
"Cassim, are you there?" he said.

62
00:05:57,241 --> 00:06:04,001
"Yes, yes... I'm here. Help me! I'm hurt."

63
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:11,721
"Open Sesame," said Ali Baba and the rock opened.

64
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:17,081
Cassim was on the floor... he couldn't walk!

65
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:23,321
"The thieves said I must die but I didn't die!" he said.

66
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:33,801
"You didn't die but you're hurt! Let's go home now and the
doctor can come to the house later tonight."

67
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:39,081
The next afternoon the thieves went back to the cave.

68
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:45,041
"He isn't here!" said the tall man.

69
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:54,921
"We must find him. He was hurt! We must find the doctor who
helped him!"

70
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:59,601
The tall man found the doctor's house.

71
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:01,401
He was angry.

72
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:09,841
"Where's the man you helped yesterday? Where's his house?"
he asked.

73
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:13,481
"I don't know," said the doctor.

74
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:18,881
"It was dark and I couldn't see the road or the houses."

75
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:27,081
"Then take me to the house tonight when it's dark," said the
tall man.

76
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:38,601
The, doctor took the tall man to Ali's house later that
night and the tall man painted a white cross on the door.

77
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:45,561
"Now I know where Cassim and his family live," he thought.

78
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:51,361
"They must all die! And I've got a plan!"

79
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:59,241
The tall man went to the market and bought thirty-nine big
oil pots.

80
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:06,761
"Put the pots on your horses then hide inside them" he told
the thieves.

81
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:17,921
"I'm going to Ali Baba's house and you'll be in the pots.
We'll kill them all tonight when they are asleep!"

82
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:21,921
That evening he went to Ali Baba's house.

83
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:35,321
"Good evening. I'm an oil merchant from India and I'm very tired," he said "Have you got a room where I can sleep and a
place for my horses?"

84
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:41,041
"Of course! Welcome to my home," said Ali.

85
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:45,201
Zhila was in the kitchen with Nasreen.

86
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:51,001
"That man isn't Indian; he's Persian," said Zhila.

87
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:58,641
"I don't like him. Let's go and look at the pots on his
horses."

88
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:02,841
They went out of the house into the garden.

89
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:09,761
There were lots of stars in the sky and everything was very
quiet.

90
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:18,121
Suddenly they heard a man's voice: "When are we going to
kill Cassim and AliBaba and their wives?"

91
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"When they're asleep," said another voice.

92
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
The women looked at the pots on the horses.

93
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
Thirty-nine pots in their garden... thirty-nine men in the
pots, and one man in the house...

94
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
The Forty Thieves!

95
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"Quickly!" said Zhila.

96
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"Open the gate."

97
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
Nasreen opened the gate.

98
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"Shoo, shoo, go away! Shoo, shoo, go away!" they shouted at
the horses.

99
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
The horses ran out of the garden.

100
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
They ran and they ran and they ran.

101
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
They ran into the desert and never came back.

102
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
The tall man went into the garden when everyone was
sleeping.

103
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
His horses weren't there!

104
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
His pots weren't there!

105
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
His men weren't there!

106
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
He ran out of the garden, he ran into the desert, but he
couldn't see his horses or his men.

107
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
He ran and he ran and he ran and he never came back.

108
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
In the morning Cassim and Ali Baba woke up early and went
into the garden.

109
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"This is very strange," said Ali.

110
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
The oil merchant isn't here, and his horses aren't here!

111
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
Where are they?"

112
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"You men are very silly," said Nasreen.

113
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"Yes, very silly," said Zhila.

114
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"The oil merchant from India wasn't an oil merchant from
India."

115
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"No," said Nasreen.

116
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"He was the leader of the forty thieves!"

117
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"Where are the forty thieves now?" said Cassim.

118
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"They ran into the desert, and let's hope they'll never come
back!" said Zhila.

119
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"Tomorrow you can go and get the treasure and we'll give
some to everyone in the village!"

120
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
The next day Cassim and Ali Baba went back to the rock with
ten grey donkeys.

121
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"Open Wheat," said Cassim.

122
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"No, silly! Don't you remember? It's not Wheat. It's
Sesame!" said Ali Baba.

123
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"Of course, the word is "Sesame". Open Sesame," said Cassim.

124
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
The rock opened and they put all the wooden boxes and sacks
of treasure on the donkeys.

125
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
Then they went back to the village and gave the treasure to
the poor villagers.

126
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,121
"Thank you, Nasreen and Zhila" said the villagers.

127
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,161
"You're very clever women!"
