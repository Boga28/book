00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,960
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,360
Life at Night

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:17,680
When the sun goes down, it gets dark and the air 
gets a lot colder. For many people, it's time to  

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:26,560
go to sleep, but a lot of animals only come out 
at night. They are called nocturnal animals.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,360
The opossum is a nocturnal animal.  

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:41,440
At night, it looks for plants and small animals 
to eat. In the day, it hides and goes to sleep.

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:53,520
The armadillo is a nocturnal animal, and it 
sleeps for more than 17 hours in the day!

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,240
Nocturnal animals aren't the only 
animals that come out at night.  

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:10,880
Some animals, like the tiger, come out in the 
day and at night. Other animals, like the rabbit,  

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,320
only come out in the morning when it's getting 
light, and in the evening when it's getting dark.

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,680
Some animals come out at night because there are 
not so many predators - animals that want to hunt  

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,920
and eat them. Some animals find more food because 
they eat other animals that come out at night.  

13
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,640
In very hot places, it's sometimes 
too hot to come out in the day.
 
 
 

14
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,840
CHAPTER TWO

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,840
Special Senses

16
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,200
Many animals that come out at night have 
special senses. This means that they can see,  

17
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,320
hear, touch, smell, or taste very well.  

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,400
These special senses help them to find 
food and to stay safe in the dark.

19
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:24,480
Wild dogs, like foxes, usually hunt in the dark. 
They have a big nose, and an amazing sense of  

20
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:36,000
smell that helps them to find food. A fox can 
smell mice through up to 12 centimeters of snow!  

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,600
Foxes also have very big ears that they can 
move, so they can hear very well all around them.

22
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,960
Raccoons are nocturnal animals that have 
long fingers and a very good sense of touch.  

23
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,600
When they are hunting for food in water, they 
use their fingers to find fish and frogs.

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,720
Many nocturnal animals can see much 
better than people in the dark.

25
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,240
They have very big eyes that let in lots of light.

26
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,400
A tarsier's eye is bigger than its brain! 
It can see very well in the dark.
 
 
 

27
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,840
CHAPTER THREE

28
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,320
Flying at Night

29
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,520
In the day, owls stay in trees or 
buildings, but at night they hunt for food.  

30
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:54,240
Owls can see very well in the dark, and they also 
have an amazing sense of hearing. They listen for  

31
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:02,320
little noises from their prey - rabbits, mice, 
and other small animals that they like to eat.  

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,400
Then they fly down and catch 
them in their sharp claws.

33
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,800
Many owls have soft feathers on their 
wings, so they can fly very quietly.  

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,400
Their prey don't know that they are coming!

35
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,840
Most types of bat are nocturnal.  

36
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,560
At night they look for fruit and flowers, 
or they hunt for insects, fish, and mice.  

37
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:46,560
Bats can see and smell very well, and many bats 
have a special sense called echolocation. This  

38
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:56,160
helps them to find food in the dark. Bats make 
special noises when they fly. The noises bounce  

39
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:06,240
off things and come back as echoes. These echoes 
tell bats where things are and how big they are.

40
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,080
In the day, bats hang upside down and 
stay in caves, trees, and buildings.

41
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,840
Bats are the only mammals that can fly!
 
 
 

42
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,040
CHAPTER FOUR

43
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,520
Ocean Animals

44
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:41,440
Some fish live near the top of the ocean in the 
day and then they swim down to the deep ocean  

45
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,040
at night. Other fish swim up to the top 
of the ocean at night, and they look for  

46
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:56,960
plankton - very small animals that swim up to 
the top of the ocean every evening to find food.

47
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:07,040
Plankton are food for fish like the lantern 
fish. The lantern fish stays down in the deep  

48
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,960
ocean in the day, but when the sun goes 
down it swims to the top of the ocean.  

49
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:21,440
It feeds near the top of the ocean at night, 
and then swims back down before morning.

50
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
The Lantern fish has lights 
on it's body when it swims.

51
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:41,920
The white tip reef shark also comes out at night. 
It stays in caves down in the deep ocean in the  

52
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:50,480
day, and doesn't move very much. Then at night, 
it comes out to hunt for fish and octopuses.
 
 
 

53
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,440
CHAPTER FIVE

54
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,000
Minibeasts

55
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:09,520
Many minibeasts, like moths and spiders, come 
out at night. Minibeasts come out at night  

56
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,040
because there are not so many 
predators that hunt and eat them.  

57
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Slugs and snails look for food at night 
because the sun can dry them out in the day.

58
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,840
Moths are insects. They have a body 
that's good for living at night.  

59
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:39,440
They have special antennae on their head. These 
help them to look for food and to find their way  

60
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:49,360
in the dark. Moths also have patterns on their 
wings that help them to hide in trees in the day.

61
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,840
Tarantulas are spiders. They 
hunt for their prey at night.  

62
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Special hairs on their body help them to 
feel when another animal is near. They hide,  

63
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,840
and then they jump on their 
prey, and put poison in its body.

64
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,440
Nocturnal fireflies make lights in their 
body that turn on and off at night.  

65
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,280
They use these lights to communicate.
 
 
 

66
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,640
CHAPTER SIX

67
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,880
Desert Animals

68
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,800
In many deserts, it's very hot in the day, 
so many animals only come out at night.  

69
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:54,560
The fennec fox lives in the Sahara Desert 
in Africa. It stays in a burrow in the sand  

70
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:04,320
in the day, and at night it hunts for mice, 
lizards, and insects. It's the smallest fox  

71
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:12,080
in the world, but it has very big ears, so 
it can easily hear its prey in the dark.

72
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,840
Kangaroo rats need to drink! They get 
water from the seeds that they eat.

73
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:33,840
Kangaroo rats live in deserts in North America. 
At night, they jump around and find seeds.  

74
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,720
They keep seeds in their mouth, and 
then they put them in their burrow.

75
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:51,440
Desert scorpions stay out of the sun in the day. 
At night, they come out to feed on minibeasts.  

76
00:09:53,280 --> 00:10:01,040
Scorpions can't see well, but they have special 
hairs on their legs so that they can feel  

77
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,600
when prey is near. They kill their 
prey with a sting from their tail.
 
 
 

78
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,880
CHAPTER SEVEN

79
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,440
African Animals

80
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:26,800
There are many nocturnal animals in Africa. Many 
big cats, like leopards, hunt for food at night.  

81
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,240
It's usually easier to catch prey when 
it's dark, and when it's cooler, too.

82
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,280
Big cats see very well, and they have 
a very good sense of hearing and smell,  

83
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:51,200
so they are good night hunters. Their eyes 
have a special part called the tapetum.  

84
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,480
The tapetum reflects light so that the cats can 
see in the dark. It can make their eyes glow.

85
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:11,360
Aardvarks can't see very well, but they have 
a big nose and big ears that they use to find  

86
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:19,360
ant nests at night. They dig up the nests 
and catch the ants on their sticky tongue.

87
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,280
An aardvark can eat 50,000 insects in one night!

88
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,280
Hippos come out at night to eat grass.  

89
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,720
In the day, they stay in water because 
their skin needs to be wet and cool.

90
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,160
Bushbabies hunt for food at night.  

91
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:56,560
They use their big eyes to look in trees 
for insects, flowers, seeds, and eggs.
 
 
 

92
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,760
CHAPTER EIGHT

93
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,400
Animals Asleep

94
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,920
At night, when many animals are looking 
for food, others are asleep, just like you!  

95
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:24,320
In the evening, baboons climb up cliffs or into 
the tops of trees, and they sleep for about  

96
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:32,400
ten hours every night. In these high places, 
they know that they are safe from predators

97
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,960
Flamingoes sleep at night, standing on one leg!  

98
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,720
They have special ankles that keep their 
legs straight so that they don't fall down.

99
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,280
Walruses live in the Arctic. It's 
light all night in the summer there.  

100
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:05,520
Walruses sleep on land, on ice, or 
in water. They can sleep for up to 19  

101
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:13,600
hours. Walruses have special pouches on 
their body. When they sleep in water,  

102
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,840
they put lots of air in the pouches, 
to keep their head above the water.

103
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,760
Walruses sometimes put their 
tusks over big pieces of ice  

104
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,840
so that they don't move away 
when they are asleep.
 
 
 

105
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,480
CHAPTER NINE

106
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,280
Noises at Night

107
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,960
It's hard to see at night, so animals 
often use noises to communicate.  

108
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,880
Owls call to each other, and lions roar 
if predators come near their babies.  

109
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:06,080
When deer are in danger, they try to 
communicate with other deer. They make noises  

110
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,520
in their nose, and they hit 
the ground with their feet.

111
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,240
Most birds do not sing at night, but 
the male nightingale sings a beautiful  

112
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:26,640
song when it's looking for a female. Some 
insects make a lot of noise at night, too.  

113
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,320
The grasshopper makes noises 
with its wings and legs.

114
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:43,440
The Tasmanian devil is a small animal that 
comes out to hunt for food in the dark. When  

115
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,960
it's scared or it thinks that another animal is 
going to take its food, it makes terrible noises.

116
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:04,160
When howler monkeys call to each other at night, 
you can hear them from about 5 kilometers away!
 
 
 

117
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,440
CHAPTER TEN

118
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,160
Traveling at Night

119
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:22,960
Every year, many types of bird migrate - 
they move from one place to another to live.  

120
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:31,920
These birds usually only come out in the day, 
but when they migrate, they travel at night.  

121
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:43,040
This is because they are safer from predators, and 
they can fly for longer because it's cooler. Also,  

122
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:53,840
they feed in the day, and then they have lots of 
energy to fly at night when they are full of food.

123
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:01,360
Green turtles are not usually nocturnal, but they 
travel at night when they are ready to lay their  

124
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:11,120
eggs. They swim to a beach and come out of the 
ocean. They wait until night when it's cooler.  

125
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,160
Then they move up the beach 
and lay their eggs in the sand.

126
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,440
When the baby turtles come out of the eggs, they 
dig their way out of the sand and they go to the  

127
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:35,840
ocean. The baby turtles do this at night when it's 
cooler, and when there are not so many predators.

128
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:44,000
There's a lot happening at night! All around the 
world, millions of animals are moving around,  

129
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,840
hunting for food, and traveling 
from one place to another.
 
 
 
 

130
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,463
- THE END -
