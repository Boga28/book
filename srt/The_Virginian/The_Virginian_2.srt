1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
Next time!

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,680
Well, perhaps I will go with you.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,400
Do you live far?”

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,360
“I live on Judge Henry’s ranch, over yondeh.”

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,000
He pointed across the mountains.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,400
“It’s on Sunk Creek.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,640
A pretty rough trail; but I can come hyeh to see you in a day,
I reckon.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,680
Well, I hope you’ll cert’nly enjoy good health, ma’am.”

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,480
“Oh, there’s one thing!” said Molly Wood, calling after him rather
quickly.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,600
“I⁠—I’m not at all afraid of horses.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,280
You needn’t bring such a gentle one.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,000
I⁠—was very tired that day, and⁠—and I don’t scream as a rule.”


13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,200
He turned and looked at her so that she could not meet his glance.


14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,080
“Bless your heart!” said he.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,400
“Will yu’ give me one o’ those flowers?”

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,840
“Oh, certainly! I’m always so glad when people like them.”

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
“They’re pretty near the color of your eyes.”

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,160
“Never mind my eyes.”

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,960
“Can’t help it, ma’am. Not since South Fork.”

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,960
He put the flower in the leather band of his hat, and rode away
on his Monte horse.

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:31,920
Miss Wood lingered a moment, then made some steps toward her gate, from which he could still
be seen; and then, with something like a toss of the head, she went in and shut her door.

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:42,520
Later in the day the Virginian met Mr. McLean, who looked at
his hat and innocently quoted, “ ‘My Looloo picked a daisy.’”

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,000
“Don’t yu’, Lin,” said the Southerner.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,600
“Then I won’t,” said Lin.

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:02:01,040
Thus, for this occasion, did the Virginian part from his lady⁠—and nothing said one way
or another about the handkerchief that had disappeared during the South Fork incident.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,640
As we fall asleep at night, our thoughts will often ramble back
and forth between the two worlds.

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,920
“What color were his eyes?” wondered Molly on her pillow.

28
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,680
“His mustache is not bristly like so many of them.

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,440
Sam never gave me such a look at Hoosic Junction.

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,280
No.⁠ ⁠… You can’t come with me.⁠ ⁠… Get off your horse.⁠ ⁠… The
passengers are all staring.⁠ ⁠…”

31
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:41,280
And while Molly was thus dreaming that the Virginian had ridden his horse into the railroad car, and sat down beside her, the fire in the
great stone chimney of her cabin flickered quietly, its gleams now and again touching the miniature of Grandmother Stark upon the wall.

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,320
Camped on the Sunk Creek trail, the Virginian was telling himself
in his blankets:⁠—

33
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,480
“I ain’t too old for education.

34
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,840
Maybe she will lend me books.

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,320
And I’ll watch her ways and learn⁠ ⁠… stand still, Monte.

36
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,040
I can learn a lot more than the kids on that.

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,640
There’s Monte⁠

38
00:02:59,640 --> 00:02:59,720
⁠…

39
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,120
you pie-biter, stop.⁠ ⁠… He has ate up your book, ma’am, but
I’ll get yu’.⁠ ⁠…”

40
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,320
And then the Virginian was fast asleep.

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,680
CHAPTER XII

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,080
Quality and Equality

43
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:20,920
To the circle at Bennington, a letter from Bear Creek was always a
welcome summons to gather and hear of doings very strange to Vermont.

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:37,000
And when the tale of the changed babies arrived duly by the post, it created a more than
usual sensation, and was read to a large number of pleased and scandalized neighbors.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,280
“I hate her to be where such things can happen,” said Mrs. Wood.


46
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,280
“I wish I could have been there,” said her son-in-law, Andrew
Bell.

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,720
“She does not mention who played the trick,” said Mrs. Andrew
Bell.

48
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,920
“We shouldn’t be any wiser if she did,” said Mrs. Wood.

49
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,120
“I’d like to meet the perpetrator,” said Andrew.

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,280
“Oh, no!” said Mrs. Wood.

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,840
“They’re all horrible.”

52
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:09,920
And she wrote at once, begging her daughter to take good care
of herself, and to see as much of Mrs. Balaam as possible.

53
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,520
“And of any other ladies that are near you.

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,680
For you seem to me to be in a community of roughs.

55
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,800
I wish you would give it all up.

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Did you expect me to laugh about the babies?”

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:41,880
Mrs. Flynt, when this story was repeated to her (she had not been invited in to hear the letter), remarked that she had always
felt that Molly Wood must be a little vulgar, ever since she began to go about giving music lessons like any ordinary German.

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,600
But Mrs. Wood was considerably relieved when the next letter
arrived.

59
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,720
It contained nothing horrible about barbecues or babies.

60
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:00,440
It mentioned the great beauty of the weather, and how well and
strong the fine air was making the writer feel.

61
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:15,520
And it asked that books might be sent, many books of all sorts, novels,
poetry, all the good old books and any good new ones that could be spared.

62
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,000
Cheap editions, of course.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,440
“Indeed she shall have them!” said Mrs. Wood.

64
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,560
“How her mind must be starving in that dreadful place!”

65
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:34,400
The letter was not a long one, and, besides the books, spoke of little else
except the fine weather and the chances for outdoor exercise that this gave.

66
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:44,680
“You have no idea,” it said, “how delightful it is to ride,
especially on a spirited horse, which I can do now quite well.”

67
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,520
“How nice that is!” said Mrs. Wood, putting down the letter.

68
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,560
“I hope the horse is not too spirited.”

69
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,640
“Who does she go riding with?” asked Mrs. Bell.

70
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
“She doesn’t say, Sarah. Why?”

71
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,680
“Nothing. She has a queer way of not mentioning things, now and
then.”

72
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,160
“Sarah!” exclaimed Mrs. Wood, reproachfully.

73
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,080
“Oh, well, mother, you know just as well as I do that she can
be very independent and unconventional.”

74
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:20,880
“Yes; but not in that way. She wouldn’t ride with poor Sam Bannett,
and after all he is a suitable person.”

75
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:29,760
Nevertheless, in her next letter, Mrs. Wood cautioned her daughter about
trusting herself with any one of whom Mrs. Balaam did not thoroughly approve.

76
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:37,520
The good lady could never grasp that Mrs. Balaam lived a long day’s journey
from Bear Creek, and that Molly saw her about once every three months.

77
00:06:37,520 --> 00:07:00,160
“We have sent your books,” the mother wrote; “everybody has contributed from their store⁠—Shakespeare, Tennyson, Browning, Longfellow; and a number of novels
by Scott, Thackeray, George Eliot, Hawthorne, and lesser writers; some volumes of Emerson; and Jane Austen complete, because you admire her so particularly.”

78
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,600
This consignment of literature reached Bear Creek about a week
before Christmas time.

79
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,640
By New Year’s Day, the Virginian had begun his education.

80
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:18,000
“Well, I have managed to get through ’em,” he said, as he entered
Molly’s cabin in February.

81
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,400
And he laid two volumes upon her table.

82
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,840
“And what do you think of them?” she inquired.

83
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,680
“I think that I’ve cert’nly earned a good long ride today.”

84
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,600
“Georgie Taylor has sprained his ankle.”

85
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,120
“No, I don’t mean that kind of a ride.

86
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,080
I’ve earned a ride with just us two alone.

87
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,880
I’ve read every word of both of ’em, yu’ know.”

88
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,000
“I’ll think about it. Did you like them?”

89
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,360
“No.

90
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,000
Not much.

91
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:01,600
If I’d knowed that one was a detective story, I’d have got yu’
to try something else on me.

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,800
Can you guess the murderer, or is the author too smart for yu’?


93
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,200
That’s all they amount to.

94
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, he was too smart for me this time, but that didn’t distress
me any.

95
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,240
That other book talks too much.”

96
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,320
Molly was scandalized, and she told him it was a great work.“


97
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,680
Oh, yes, yes.

98
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,920
A fine book.

99
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,240
But it will keep up its talkin’.

100
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,640
Don’t let you alone.”

101
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,800
“Didn’t you feel sorry for poor Maggie Tulliver?”

102
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,400
“Hmp. Yes. Sorry for her, and for Tawmmy, too. But the man did
right to drownd ’em both.”

103
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
“It wasn’t a man. A woman wrote that.”

104
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,880
“A woman did! Well, then, o’ course she talks too much.”

105
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,440
“I’ll not go riding with you!” shrieked Molly.

106
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,960
But she did.

107
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,920
And he returned to Sunk Creek, not with a detective story, but
this time with a Russian novel.

108
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,640
It was almost April when he brought it back to her⁠—and a heavy
sleet storm lost them their ride.

109
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,880
So he spent his time indoors with her, not speaking a syllable
of love.

110
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:21,560
When he came to take his departure, he asked her for some other
book by this same Russian.

111
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,640
But she had no more.

112
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,040
“I wish you had,” he said.

113
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,200
“I’ve never saw a book could tell the truth like that one does.”


114
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,920
“Why, what do you like about it?” she exclaimed.

115
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,520
To her it had been distasteful.

116
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,440
“Everything,” he answered.

117
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:48,600
“That young come-outer, and his fam’ly that can’t understand
him⁠—for he is broad gauge, yu’ see, and they are narro’ gauge.”

118
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,040
The Virginian looked at Molly a moment almost shyly.

119
00:09:52,040 --> 00:10:05,360
“Do you know,” he said, and a blush spread over his face, “I pretty near cried
when that young come-outer was dyin’, and said about himself, ‘I was a giant.’

120
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,680
Life made him broad gauge, yu’ see, and then took his chance
away.”

121
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,280
Molly liked the Virginian for his blush.

122
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,720
It made him very handsome.

123
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,040
But she thought that it came from his confession about “pretty
near crying.”

124
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,040
The deeper cause she failed to divine⁠—that

125
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,080
he

126
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:34,480
, like the dying hero in the novel, felt himself to be a giant
whom life had made “broad gauge,” and denied opportunity.

127
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:43,880
Fecund nature begets and squanders thousands of these rich seeds
in the wilderness of life.

128
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,480
He took away with him a volume of Shakespeare.

129
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,240
“I’ve saw good plays of his,” he remarked.

130
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:59,400
Kind Mrs. Taylor in her cabin next door watched him ride off
in the sleet, bound for the lonely mountain trail.

131
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:09,800
“If that girl don’t get ready to take him pretty soon,” she observed
to her husband, “I’ll give her a piece of my mind.”

132
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,920
Taylor was astonished. “Is he thinking of her?” he inquired.

133
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,560
“Lord, Mr. Taylor, and why shouldn’t he?”

134
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,000
Mr. Taylor scratched his head and returned to his newspaper.

135
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,640
It was warm⁠—warm and beautiful upon Bear Creek.

136
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:39,000
Snow shone upon the peaks of the Bow Leg range; lower on their slopes the pines were
stirring with a gentle song; and flowers bloomed across the wide plains at their feet.

137
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Molly and her Virginian sat at a certain spring where he had
often ridden with her.

138
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,760
On this day he was bidding her farewell before undertaking the
most important trust which Judge Henry had as yet given him.

139
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,880
For this journey she had provided him with Sir Walter Scott’s
Kenilworth.

140
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,360
Shakespeare he had returned to her.

141
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,480
He had bought Shakespeare for himself.

142
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:14,800
“As soon as I got used to readin’ it,” he had told her, “I knowed
for certain that I liked readin’ for enjoyment.”

143
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,720
But it was not of books that he had spoken much today.

144
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,360
He had not spoken at all.

145
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:32,960
He had bade her listen to the meadowlark, when its song fell
upon the silence like beaded drops of music.

146
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:39,400
He had showed her where a covey of young willow-grouse were hiding
as their horses passed.

147
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:46,800
And then, without warning, as they sat by the spring, he had
spoken potently of his love.

148
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
She did not interrupt him.

149
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,080
She waited until he was wholly finished.

150
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:57,400
“I am not the sort of wife you want,” she said, with an attempt
of airiness.

151
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,800
He answered roughly, “I am the judge of that.”

152
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,960
And his roughness was a pleasure to her, yet it made her afraid
of herself.

153
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:22,240
When he was absent from her, and she could sit in her cabin and look at Grandmother Stark, and read home letters, then in imagination she
found it easy to play the part which she had arranged to play regarding him⁠—the part of the guide, and superior, and indulgent companion.

154
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,200
But when he was by her side, that part became a difficult one.


155
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
Her woman’s fortress was shaken by a force unknown to her before.


156
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:40,720
Sam Bannett did not have it in him to look as this man could look,
when the cold lustre of his eyes grew hot with internal fire.

157
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,200
What color they were baffled her still.

158
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,160
“Can it possibly change?” she wondered.

159
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:55,320
It seemed to her that sometimes when she had been looking from a rock
straight down into clear sea water, this same color had lurked in its depths.

160
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:04,120
“Is it green, or is it gray?” she asked herself, but did not
turn just now to see.

161
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,000
She kept her face toward the landscape.

162
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,360
“All men are born equal,” he now remarked slowly.

163
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,280
“Yes,” she quickly answered, with a combative flash.

164
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,920
“Well?”

165
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,000
“Maybe that don’t include women?” he suggested.

166
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,160
“I think it does.”

167
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,600
“Do yu’ tell the kids so?”

168
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,840
“Of course I teach them what I believe!”

169
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,680
He pondered.

170
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:35,040
“I used to have to learn about the Declaration of Independence.
I hated books and truck when I was a kid.”

171
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
“But you don’t any more.”

172
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,960
“No.

173
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,320
I cert’nly don’t.

174
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,560
But I used to get kep’ in at recess for bein’ so dumb.

175
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,240
I was most always at the tail end of the class.

176
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,680
My brother, he’d be head sometimes.”

177
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,160
“Little George Taylor is my prize scholar,” said Molly.

178
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,960
“Knows his tasks, does he?”

179
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,240
“Always. And Henry Dow comes next.”

180
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,480
“Who’s last?”

181
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,800
“Poor Bob Carmody. I spend more time on him than on all the rest
put together.”

182
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,680
“My!” said the Virginian.

183
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,720
“Ain’t that strange!”

184
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,600
She looked at him, puzzled by his tone.

185
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,120
“It’s not strange when you know Bob,” she said.

186
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,560
“It’s very strange,” drawled the Virginian.

187
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,920
“Knowin’ Bob don’t help it any.”

188
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,520
“I don’t think that I understand you,” said Molly, sticky.

189
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,720
“Well, it is mighty confusin’.

190
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:51,200
George Taylor, he’s your best scholar, and poor Bob, he’s your worst,
and there’s a lot in the middle⁠—and you tell me we’re all born equal!”

191
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,800
Molly could only sit giggling in this trap he had so ingeniously
laid for her.

192
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:09,520
“I’ll tell you what,” pursued the cowpuncher, with slow and growing
intensity, “equality is a great big bluff.

193
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,080
It’s easy called.”

194
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,040
“I didn’t mean⁠—” began Molly.

195
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,840
“Wait, and let me say what I mean.”

196
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,160
He had made an imperious gesture with his hand.

197
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,120
“I know a man that mostly wins at cyards.

198
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,760
I know a man that mostly loses.

199
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,720
He says it is his luck.

200
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,480
All right.

201
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,720
Call it his luck.

202
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:37,680
I know a man that works hard and he’s gettin’ rich, and I know
another that works hard and is gettin’ poor.

203
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,320
He says it is his luck.

204
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,680
All right.

205
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,200
Call it his luck.

206
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,600
I look around and I see folks movin’ up or movin’ down, winners
or losers everywhere.

207
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,560
All luck, of course.

208
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:54,160
But since folks can be born that different in their luck, where’s
your equality?

209
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,600
No, seh!

210
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:05,600
call your failure luck, or call it laziness, wander around the words, prospect
all yu’ mind to, and yu’ll come out the same old trail of inequality.”

211
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,840
He paused a moment and looked at her.

212
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:24,280
“Some holds four aces,” he went on, “and some holds nothin’, and some poor fello’ gets the aces
and no show to play ’em; but a man has got to prove himself my equal before I’ll believe him.”

213
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,840
Molly sat gazing at him, silent.

214
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,640
“I know what yu’ meant,” he told her now, “by sayin’ you’re not
the wife I’d want.

215
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,000
But I am the kind that moves up.

216
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,840
I am goin’ to be your best scholar

217
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:36,960
.”

218
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,040
He turned toward her, and that fortress within her began to shake.


219
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,600
“Don’t,” she murmured.

220
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,680
“Don’t, please.”

221
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,520
“Don’t what?”

222
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,080
“Why⁠—spoil this.”

223
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,600
“Spoil it?”

224
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,720
“These rides⁠—I don’t love you⁠—I can’t⁠—but these rides are⁠—”


225
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,080
“What are they?”

226
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,520
“My greatest pleasure. There! And, please, I want them to go
on so.”

227
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,160
“Go on so!

228
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,080
I don’t reckon yu’ know what you’re sayin’.

229
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,560
Yu’ might as well ask fruit to stay green.

230
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,400
If the way we are now can keep bein’ enough for you, it can’t
for me.

231
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,720
A pleasure to you, is it?

232
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,800
Well, to me it is⁠—I don’t know what to call it.

233
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:26,600
I come to yu’ and I hate it, and I come again and I hate it,
and I ache and grieve all over when I go.

234
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,400
No!

235
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:34,360
You will have to think of some other way than just invitin’ me
to keep green.”

236
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,600
“If I am to see you⁠—” began the girl.

237
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,080
“You’re not to see me. Not like this. I can stay away easier
than what I am doin’.”

238
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,080
“Will you do me a favor, a great one?” said she, now.

239
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,000
“Make it as impossible as you please!” he cried.

240
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,560
He thought it was to be some action.

241
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:57,840
“Go on coming. But don’t talk to me about⁠—don’t talk in that
way⁠—if you can help it.”

242
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,360
He laughed out, not permitting himself to swear.

243
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:08,080
“But,” she continued, “if you can’t help talking that way⁠—sometimes⁠—I
promise I will listen.

244
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,480
That is the only promise I make.”

245
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,320
“That is a bargain,” he said.

246
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,320
Then he helped her mount her horse, restraining himself like
a Spartan, and they rode home to her cabin.

247
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,400
“You have made it pretty near impossible,” he said, as he took
his leave.

248
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,000
“But you’ve been square today, and I’ll show you I can be square
when I come back.

249
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,240
I’ll not do more than ask you if your mind’s the same.

250
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,440
And now I’ll not see you for quite a while.

251
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,920
I am going a long way.

252
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,960
But I’ll be very busy.

253
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,720
And bein’ busy always keeps me from grievin’ too much about you.”


254
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,120
Strange is woman!

255
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,960
She would rather have heard some other last remark than this.


256
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,440
“Oh, very well !” she said.

257
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,720
“I’ll not miss you either.”

258
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,040
He smiled at her.

259
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,280
“I doubt if yu’ can help missin’ me,” he remarked.

260
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,880
And he was gone at once, galloping on his Monte horse.

261
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,120
Which of the two won a victory this day?

262
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,320
CHAPTER XIII

263
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,960
The Game and the Nation⁠—Act First

264
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,920
There can be no doubt of this:⁠—

265
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,800
All America is divided into two classes⁠—the quality and the
equality.

266
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,880
The latter will always recognize the former when mistaken for
it.

267
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,640
Both will be with us until our women bear nothing but kings.

268
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:34,160
It was through the Declaration of Independence that we Americans
acknowledged the eternal inequality of man.

269
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,800
For by it we abolished a cut-and-dried aristocracy.

270
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:51,840
We had seen little men artificially held up in high places, and great men artificially held
down in low places, and our own justice-loving hearts abhorred this violence to human nature.

271
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,240
Therefore, we decreed that every man should thenceforth have
equal liberty to find his own level.

272
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:06,920
By this very decree we acknowledged and gave freedom to true
aristocracy, saying, “Let the best man win, whoever he is.”

273
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,480
Let the best man win!

274
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,800
That is America’s word.

275
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,840
That is true democracy.

276
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,400
And true democracy and true aristocracy are one and the same
thing.

277
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,840
If anybody cannot see this, so much the worse for his eyesight.


278
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:34,280
The above reflections occurred to me before reaching Billings, Montana, some
three weeks after I had unexpectedly met the Virginian at Omaha, Nebraska.

279
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:41,640
I had not known of that trust given to him by Judge Henry, which
was taking him East.

280
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:48,520
I was looking to ride with him before long among the clean hills
of Sunk Creek.

281
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,520
I supposed he was there.

282
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,960
But I came upon him one morning in Colonel Cyrus Jones’s eating
palace.

283
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,520
Did you know the palace?

284
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:05,280
It stood in Omaha, near the trains, and it was ten years old
(which is middle-aged in Omaha) when I first saw it.

285
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:14,120
It was a shell of wood, painted with golden emblems⁠—the steamboat, the
eagle, the Yosemite⁠—and a live bear ate gratuities at its entrance.

286
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Weather permitting, it opened upon the world as a stage upon
the audience.

287
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:27,920
You sat in Omaha’s whole sight and dined, while Omaha’s dust
came and settled upon the refreshments.

288
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,120
It is gone the way of the Indian and the buffalo, for the West
is growing old.

289
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,840
You should have seen the palace and sat there.

290
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:47,400
In front of you passed rainbows of men⁠—Chinese, Indian chiefs, Africans,
General Miles, younger sons, Austrian nobility, wide females in pink.

291
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,880
Our continent drained prismatically through Omaha once.

292
00:22:51,880 --> 00:23:05,800
So I was passing that way also, walking for the sake of ventilation from a
sleeping-car toward a bath, when the language of Colonel Cyrus Jones came out to me.

293
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,600
The actual colonel I had never seen before.

294
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:15,960
He stood at the rear of his palace in gray flowery mustaches and a Confederate
uniform, telling the wishes of his guests to the cook through a hole.

295
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:25,120
You always bought meal tickets at once, else you became unwelcome.


296
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:32,680
Guests here had foibles at times, and a rapid exit was too easy.


297
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,840
Therefore I bought a ticket.

298
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,480
It was spring and summer since I had heard anything like the
colonel.

299
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:49,480
The Missouri had not yet flowed into New York dialect freely,
and his vocabulary met me like the breeze of the plains.

300
00:23:49,480 --> 00:24:01,200
So I went in to be fanned by it, and there sat the Virginian
at a table, alone.

301
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:12,600
His greeting was up to the code of indifference proper on the plains; but he
presently remarked, “I’m right glad to see somebody,” which was a good deal to say.

302
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,640
“Them that comes hyeh,” he observed next, “don’t eat.

303
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,400
They feed.”

304
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,880
And he considered the guests with a sombre attention.

305
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,720
“D’ yu’ reckon they find joyful digestion in this swallo’-an’-get-out
trough?”

306
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,600
“What are you doing here, then?” said I.

307
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,400
“Oh, pshaw! When yu’ can’t have what you choose, yu’ just choose
what you have.”

308
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,360
And he took the bill-of-fare.

309
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:46,080
I began to know that he had something on his mind, so I did not
trouble him further.

310
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,640
Meanwhile he sat studying the bill-of-fare.

311
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,760
“Ever heard o’ them?” he inquired, shoving me the spotted document.


312
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:05,480
Most improbable dishes were there⁠—salmis, canapés, suprêmes⁠—all
perfectly spelt and absolutely transparent.

313
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:28,080
It was the old trick of copying some metropolitan menu to catch travellers of the third and last dimension of innocence; and
whenever this is done the food is of the third and last dimension of awfulness, which the cowpuncher knew as well as anybody.

314
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,320
“So they keep that up here still,” I said.

315
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,000
“But what about them?” he repeated.

316
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,400
His finger was at a special item, Frogs’ legs à la Delmonico.


317
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,160
“Are they true anywheres?” he asked.

318
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,360
And I told him, certainly.

319
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:55,320
I also explained to him about Delmonico of New York and about
Augustin of Philadelphia.

320
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:03,520
“There’s not a little bit o’ use in lyin’ to me this mawnin’,”
he said, with his engaging smile.

321
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,320
“I ain’t goin’ to awdeh anything’s laigs .”

322
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:15,840
“Well, I’ll see how he gets out of it,” I said, remembering the
odd Texas legend.

323
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,560
(The traveller read the bill-of-fare, you know, and called for
a vol-au-vent.

324
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:29,960
And the proprietor looked at the traveller, and running a pistol
into his ear, observed, “You’ll take hash.”)

325
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,520
I was thinking of this and wondering what would happen to me.


326
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,200
So I took the step.

327
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,680
“Wants frogs’ legs, does he?” shouted Colonel Cyrus Jones.

328
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,240
He fixed his eye upon me, and it narrowed to a slit.

329
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,920
“Too many brain workers breakfasting before yu’ came in, professor,”
said he.

330
00:26:51,920 --> 00:27:04,360
“Missionary ate the last leg off me just now. Brown the wheat!” he
commanded, through the hole to the cook, for someone had ordered hot cakes.

331
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,960
“I’ll have fried aiggs,” said the Virginian.

332
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,640
“Cooked both sides.”

333
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,080
“White wings!” sang the colonel through the hole.

334
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,200
“Let ’em fly up and down.”

335
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,280
“Coffee an’ no milk,” said the Virginian.

336
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,440
“Draw one in the dark!” the colonel roared.

337
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,000
“And beefsteak, rare.”

338
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,960
“One slaughter in the pan, and let the blood drip!”

339
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,280
“I should like a glass of water, please,” said I.

340
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,360
The colonel threw me a look of pity.

341
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,760
“One Missouri and ice for the professor!” he said.

342
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,080
“That fello’s a right live man,” commented the Virginian.

343
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,920
But he seemed thoughtful.

344
00:27:51,920 --> 00:28:02,400
Presently he inquired, “Yu’ say he was a foreigner, an’ learned
fancy cookin’ to New Yawk?”

345
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,520
That was this cowpuncher’s way.

346
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:11,080
Scarcely ever would he let drop a thing new to him until he had
got from you your whole information about it.

347
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:19,800
So I told him the history of Lorenzo Delmonico and his pioneer
work, as much as I knew, and the Southerner listened intently.

348
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,120
“Mighty inter-estin’,” he said⁠—“mighty.

349
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:30,520
He could just take little old o’rn’ry frawgs, and dandy ’em up
to suit the bloods.

350
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,360
Mighty inter

351
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,360
-

352
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,240
estin’.

353
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,920
I expaict, though, his cookin’ would give an outraiged stomach
to a plain-raised man.”

354
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:49,200
“If you want to follow it up,” said I, by way of a sudden experiment,
“Miss Molly Wood might have some book about French dishes.”

355
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,160
But the Virginian did not turn a hair.

356
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,200
“I reckon she wouldn’t,” he answered.

357
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,120
“She was raised in Vermont.

358
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,880
They don’t bother overly about their eatin’ up in Vermont.

359
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,960
Hyeh’s what Miss Wood recommended the las’ time I was seein’
her,” the cowpuncher added, bringing Kenilworth from his pocket.

360
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:14,320
“Right fine story. That Queen Elizabeth must have cert’nly been
a competent woman.”

361
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,880
“She was,” said I.

362
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,080
But talk came to an end here.

363
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:28,480
A dusty crew, most evidently from the plains, now entered and drifted to a
table; and each man of them gave the Virginian about a quarter of a slouchy nod.

364
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,440
His greeting to them was very serene.

365
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,480
Only, Kenilworthwent back into his pocket, and he breakfasted
in silence.

366
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,400
Among those who had greeted him I now recognized a face.

367
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,200
“Why, that’s the man you played cards with at Medicine Bow!”
I said.

368
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,160
“Yes. Trampas. He’s got a job at the ranch now.”

369
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,240
The Virginian said no more, but went on with his breakfast.

370
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,000
His appearance was changed.

371
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,520
Aged I would scarcely say, for this would seem as if he did not
look young.

372
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:29,280
But I think that the boy was altogether gone from his face⁠—the boy whose freak with Steve had turned Medicine Bow
upside down, whose other freak with the babies had outraged Bear Creek, the boy who had loved to jingle his spurs.

373
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:37,200
But manhood had only trained, not broken, his youth.

374
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,000
It was all there, only obedient to the rein and curb.

375
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,520
Presently we went together to the railway yard.

376
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:57,440
“The Judge is doing a right smart o’ business this year,” he
began, very casually indeed, so that I knew this was important.

377
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:04,360
Besides bells and coal smoke, the smell and crowded sounds of
cattle rose in the air around us.

378
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:09,640
“Hyeh’s our first gather o’ beeves on the ranch,” continued the
Virginian.

379
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,440
“The whole lot’s shipped through to Chicago in two sections over
the Burlington.

380
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,400
The Judge is fighting the Elkhorn road.”

381
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:26,920
We passed slowly along the two trains⁠—twenty cars, each car
packed with huddled, round-eyed, gazing steers.

382
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,600
He examined to see if any animals were down.

383
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:39,760
“They ain’t ate or drank anything to speak of,” he said, while
the terrified brutes stared at us through their slats.

384
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,920
“Not since they struck the railroad they’ve not drank.

385
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,920
Yu’ might suppose they know somehow what they’re travellin’ to
Chicago for.”

386
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,720
And casually, always casually, he told me the rest.

387
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,040
Judge Henry could not spare his foreman away from the second
gather of beeves.

388
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:03,480
Therefore these two ten-car trains with their double crew of
cowboys had been given to the Virginian’s charge.

389
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:26,880
After Chicago, he was to return by St. Paul over the Northern Pacific; for the Judge had wished him to see certain of the road’s directors
and explain to them persuasively how good a thing it would be for them to allow especially cheap rates to the Sunk Creek outfit henceforth.

390
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,320
This was all the Virginian told me; and it contained the whole
matter, to be sure.

391
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,160
“So you’re acting foreman,” said I.

392
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,360
“Why, somebody has to have the say, I reckon.”

393
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,960
“And of course you hated the promotion?”

394
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,480
“I don’t know about promotion,” he replied.

395
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:51,080
“The boys have been used to seein’ me one of themselves. Why
don’t you come along with us far as Plattsmouth?”

396
00:32:51,080 --> 00:33:03,360
Thus he shifted the subject from himself, and called to my notice the locomotives backing up
to his cars, and reminded me that from Plattsmouth I had the choice of two trains returning.

397
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:12,320
But he could not hide or belittle this confidence of his employer
in him.

398
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:19,480
It was the care of several thousand perishable dollars and the
control of men.

399
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,960
It was a compliment.

400
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:32,600
There were more steers than men to be responsible for; but none of the
steers had been suddenly picked from the herd and set above his fellows.

401
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:55,520
Moreover, Chicago finished up the steers; but the new-made deputy foreman had then to lead his six highly unoccupied
brethren away from towns, and back in peace to the ranch, or disappoint the Judge, who needed their services.

402
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:09,520
These things sometimes go wrong in a land where they say you are all born equal; and that quarter of
a nod in Colonel Cyrus Jones’s eating palace held more equality than any whole nod you could see.

403
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,680
But the Virginian did not see it, there being a time for all
things.

404
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:22,160
We trundled down the flopping, heavy-eddied Missouri to Plattsmouth, and there they
backed us on to a siding, the Christian Endeavor being expected to pass that way.

405
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:42,360
And while the equality absorbed themselves in a deep but harmless game of poker by the side of the
railway line, the Virginian and I sat on the top of a car, contemplating the sandy shallows of the Platte.

406
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,440
“I should think you’d take a hand,” said I.

407
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,320
“Poker? With them kittens?”

408
00:34:51,320 --> 00:35:01,880
One flash of the inner man lightened in his eyes and died away, and he
finished with his gentle drawl, “When I play, I want it to be interestin’.”

409
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:09,040
He took out Sir Walter’s Kenilworth once more, and turned the
volume over and over slowly, without opening it.

410
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,200
You cannot tell if in spirit he wandered on Bear Creek with the
girl whose book it was.

411
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:23,400
The spirit will go one road, and the thought another, and the
body its own way sometimes.

412
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,400
“Queen Elizabeth would have played a mighty pow’ful game,” was
his next remark.

413
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,320
“Poker?” said I.“

414
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,360
Yes, seh.

415
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,200
Do you expaict Europe has got any queen equal to her at present?”


416
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,160
I doubted it.

417
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,480
“Victoria’d get pretty nigh slain sliding chips out agaynst Elizabeth.


418
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Only mos’ prob’ly Victoria she’d insist on a half-cent limit.


419
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,240
You have read this hyeh Kenilworth?

420
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:54,760
Well, deal Elizabeth ace high, an’ she could scare Robert Dudley
with a full house plumb out o’ the bettin’.”

421
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,200
I said that I believed she unquestionably could.

422
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:06,560
“And,” said the Virginian, “if Essex’s play got next her too
near, I reckon she’d have stacked the cyards.

423
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,200
Say, d’ yu’ remember Shakespeare’s fat man?”

424
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,480
“Falstaff? Oh, yes, indeed.”

425
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,720
“Ain’t that grand?

426
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,240
Why, he makes men talk the way they do in life.

427
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,280
I reckon he couldn’t get printed today.

428
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,600
It’s a right down shame Shakespeare couldn’t know about poker.


429
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:32,680
He’d have had Falstaff playing all day at that Tearsheet outfit.


430
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,680
And the Prince would have beat him.”

431
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,240
“The Prince had the brains,” said I.

432
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,200
“Brains?”

433
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,840
“Well, didn’t he?”

434
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,200
“I neveh thought to notice. Like as not he did.”

435
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,160
“And Falstaff didn’t, I suppose?”

436
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,000
“Oh, yes, seh! Falstaff could have played whist.”

437
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,800
“I suppose you know what you’re talking about; I don’t,” said
I, for he was drawling again.

438
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,120
The cowpuncher’s eye rested a moment amiably upon me.

439
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,960
“You can play whist with your brains,” he mused⁠—“brains and
cyards.

440
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,320
Now cyards are only one o’ the manifestations of poker in this
hyeh world.

441
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,640
One o’ the shapes yu fool with it in when the day’s work is oveh.


442
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:27,960
If a man is built like that Prince boy was built (and it’s away down deep beyond brains),
he’ll play winnin’ poker with whatever hand he’s holdin’ when the trouble begins.

443
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:39,240
Maybe it will be a mean, triflin’ army, or an empty six-shooter, or
a lame hawss, or maybe just nothin’ but his natural countenance.

444
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:46,920
’Most any old thing will do for a fello’ like that Prince boy
to play poker with.”

445
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,720
“Then I’d be grateful for your definition of poker,” said I.

446
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,360
Again the Virginian looked me over amiably.

447
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:01,560
“You put up a mighty pretty game o’ whist yourself,” he remarked.


448
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,920
“Don’t that give you the contented spirit?”

449
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:11,680
And before I had any reply to this, the Christian Endeavor began
to come over the bridge.

450
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:28,120
Three instalments crossed the Missouri from Pacific Junction, bound for Pike’s Peak, every car
swathed in bright bunting, and at each window a Christian with a handkerchief, joyously shrieking.

451
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,920
Then the cattle trains got the open signal, and I jumped off.


452
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,400
“Tell the Judge the steers was all right this far,” said the
Virginian.

453
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,880
That was the last of the deputy foreman for a while.

454
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,520
CHAPTER XIV

455
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
Between the Acts

456
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:52,640
My road to Sunk Creek lay in no straight line.

457
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,360
By rail I diverged northwest to Fort Meade, and thence

458
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,000
, after some stay with the kind military people, I made my way
on a horse.

459
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,440
Up here in the Black Hills it sluiced rain most intolerably.

460
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:19,440
The horse and I enjoyed the country and ourselves but little; and when finally I changed from the
saddle into a stagecoach, I caught a thankful expression upon the animal’s face, and returned the same.

461
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,600
“Six legs inside this jerky tonight?” said somebody, as I climbed
the wheel.

462
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,560
“Well, we’ll give thanks for not havin’ eight,” he added cheerfully.


463
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,080
“Clamp your mind on to that, Shorty.”

464
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,720
And he slapped the shoulder of his neighbor.

465
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,280
Naturally I took these two for old companions.

466
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,520
But we were all total strangers.

467
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:55,920
They told me of the new gold excitement at Rawhide, and supposed it would bring up the Northern Pacific; and when I explained
the millions owed to this road’s German bondholders, they were of opinion that a German would strike it richer at Rawhide.

468
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:02,320
We spoke of all sorts of things, and in our silence I gloated
on the autumn holiday promised me by Judge Henry.

469
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:10,800
His last letter had said that an outfit would be starting for his
ranch from Billings on the seventh, and he would have a horse for me.

470
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,520
This was the fifth.

471
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:24,560
So we six legs in the jerky travelled harmoniously on over the rain-gutted road,
getting no deeper knowledge of each other than what our outsides might imply.

472
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,280
Not that we concealed anything.

473
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,280
The man who had slapped Shorty introduced himself early.

474
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,440
“Scipio le Moyne, from Gallipolice, Ohio,” he said.

475
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:43,920
“The eldest of us always gets called Scipio. It’s French. But
us folks have been white for a hundred years.”

476
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:54,680
He was limber and light-muscled, and fell skilfully about, evading
bruises when the jerky reeled or rose on end.

477
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:02,320
He had a strange, long, jocular nose, very wary-looking, and
a bleached blue eye.

478
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:11,440
Cattle was his business, as a rule, but of late he had been “looking
around some,” and Rawhide seemed much on his brain.

479
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,200
Shorty struck me as “looking around” also.

480
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:20,000
He was quite short, indeed, and the jerky hurt him almost every
time.

481
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,560
He was light-haired and mild.

482
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:30,840
Think of a yellow dog that is lost, and fancies each newcomer in
sight is going to turn out his master, and you will have Shorty.

483
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:38,160
It was the Northern Pacific that surprised us into intimacy.

484
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,240
We were nearing Medora.

485
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,400
We had made a last arrangement of our legs.

486
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,320
I lay stretched in silence, placid in the knowledge it was soon
to end.

487
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,760
So I drowsed.

488
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,200
I felt something sudden, and, waking, saw Scipio passing through
the air.

489
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:04,440
As Shorty next shot from the jerky, I beheld smoke and the locomotive.


490
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,200
The Northern Pacific had changed its schedule.

491
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,760
A valise is a poor companion for catching a train with.

492
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,480
There was rutted sand and lumpy, knee-high grease wood in our
shortcut.

493
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,440
A piece of stray wire sprang from some hole and hung caracoling
about my ankle.

494
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,280
Tin cans spun from my stride.

495
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,240
But we made a conspicuous race.

496
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:33,680
Two of us waved hats, and there was no moment that some one of
us was not screeching.

497
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,760
It meant twenty-four hours to us.

498
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,520
Perhaps we failed to catch the train’s attention, though the
theory seems monstrous.

499
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:57,880
As it moved off in our faces, smooth and easy and insulting, Scipio dropped instantly
to a walk, and we two others outstripped him and came desperately to the empty track.

500
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,480
There went the train.

501
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:10,280
Even still its puffs were the separated puffs of starting, that
bitten-off, snorty kind, and sweat and our true natures broke freely forth.

502
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,200
I kicked my valise, and then sat on it, dumb.

503
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,040
Shorty yielded himself up aloud.

504
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,960
All his humble secrets came out of him.

505
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,440
He walked aimlessly round, lamenting.

506
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,000
He had lost his job, and he mentioned the ranch.

507
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,400
He had played cards, and he mentioned the man.

508
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:44,520
He had sold his horse and saddle to catch a friend on this train,
and he mentioned what the friend had been going to do for him.

509
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:50,200
He told a string of griefs and names to the air, as if the air
knew.

510
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,720
Meanwhile Scipio arrived with extreme leisure at the rails.

511
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:01,160
He stuck his hands into his pockets and his head out at the very
small train.

512
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:09,320
His bleached blue eyes shut to slits as he watched the rear car
in its smoke-blur ooze away westward among the mounded bluffs.

513
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,400
“Lucky it’s out of range,” I thought.

514
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,320
But now Scipio spoke to it.

515
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:20,400
“Why, you seem to think you’ve left me behind,” he began easily,
in fawning tones.

516
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,120
“You’re too much of a kid to have such thoughts. Age some.”

517
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,760
His next remark grew less wheedling.

518
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,920
“I wouldn’t be a bit proud to meet yu’.

519
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:39,280
Why, if I was seen travellin’ with yu’, I’d have to explain it
to my friends!

520
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,280
Think you’ve got me left, do yu’?

521
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:51,160
Just because yu’ ride through this country on a rail, do yu’
claim yu’ can find your way around?

522
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:58,360
I could take yu’ out ten yards in the brush and lose yu’ in ten
seconds, you spangle-roofed hobo!

523
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,520
Leave me behind?

524
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,680
you recent blanket-mortgage yearlin’!

525
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:12,160
You plush-lined, nickel-plated, whistlin’ wash room, d’ yu’ figure
I can’t go east just as soon as west?

526
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,320
Or I’ll stay right here if it suits me, yu’ dude-inhabited hotbox!


527
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,240
Why, yu’ coon-bossed face-towel⁠—”

528
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:29,680
But from here he rose in flights of novelty that appalled and
held me spellbound, and which are not for me to say to you.

529
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:40,800
Then he came down easily again, and finished with expressions
of sympathy for it because it could never have known a mother.

530
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,520
“Do you expaict it could show a male parent offhand?” inquired
a slow voice behind us.

531
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,360
I jumped round, and there was the Virginian.

532
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,120
“Male parent!” scoffed the prompt Scipio.

533
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,000
“Ain’t you heard about them yet?”

534
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,200
“Them? Was there two?”

535
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,560
“Two? The blamed thing was sired by a whole doggone Dutch syndicate.”


536
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:02,720
“Why, the piebald son of a gun!” responded the Virginian, sweetly.


537
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,680
“I got them steers through all right,” he added to me.

538
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:16,640
“Sorry to see yu’ get so out o’ breath afteh the train. Is your
valise sufferin’ any?”

539
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,120
“Who’s he?” inquired Scipio, curiously, turning to me.

540
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,480
The Southerner sat with a newspaper on the rear platform of a
caboose.

541
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:31,560
The caboose stood hitched behind a mile or so of freight train,
and the train was headed west.

542
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:42,760
So here was the deputy foreman, his steers delivered in Chicago, his men (I could hear them)
safe in the caboose, his paper in his lap, and his legs dangling at ease over the railing.

543
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,640
He wore the look of a man for whom things are going smooth.

544
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,200
And for me the way to Billings was smooth now, also.

545
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,520
“Who’s he?” Scipio repeated.

546
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:01,360
But from inside the caboose loud laughter and noise broke on
us.

547
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,840
Someone was reciting “And it’s my night to howl.”

548
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,320
“We’ll all howl when we get to Rawhide,” said some other one;
and they howled now.

549
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:15,520
“These hyeh steam cyars,” said the Virginian to Scipio, “make
a man’s language mighty nigh as speedy as his travel.”

550
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:22,520
Of Shorty he took no notice whatever⁠—no more than of the manifestations
in the caboose.

551
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:27,360
“So yu’ heard me speakin’ to the express,” said Scipio.

552
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:42,680
“Well, I guess, sometimes I⁠—See here,” he exclaimed, for the Virginian was
gravely considering him, “I may have talked some, but I walked a whole lot.

553
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,880
You didn’t catch me squandering no speed.

554
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,000
Soon as⁠—”

555
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,640
“I noticed,” said the Virginian, “thinkin’ came quicker to yu’
than runnin’.”

556
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:58,840
I was glad I was not Shorty, to have my measure taken merely
by my way of missing a train.

557
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,960
And of course I was sorry that I had kicked my valise.

558
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,160
“Oh, I could tell yu’d been enjoyin’ us!” said Scipio.

559
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,640
“Observin’ somebody else’s scrape always kind o’ rests me too.


560
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,720
Maybe you’re a philosopher, but maybe there’s a pair of us drawd
in this deal.”

561
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,640
Approval now grew plain upon the face of the Virginian.

562
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,760
“By your laigs,” said he, “you are used to the saddle.”

563
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,360
“I’d be called used to it, I expect.”

564
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,600
“By your hands,” said the Southerner, again, “you ain’t roped
many steers lately.

565
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,960
Been cookin’ or something?”

566
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,640
“Say,” retorted Scipio, “tell my future some now.

567
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,800
Draw a conclusion from my mouth.”

568
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,880
“I’m right distressed,” answered the gentle Southerner, “we’ve
not a drop in the outfit.”

569
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,520
“Oh, drink with me uptown!” cried Scipio.

570
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,000
“I’m pleased to death with yu’.”

571
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,440
The Virginian glanced where the saloons stood just behind the
station, and shook his head.

572
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,760
“Why, it ain’t a bit far to whiskey from here!” urged the other,
plaintively.

573
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,360
“Step down, now.

574
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,840
Scipio le Moyne’s my name.

575
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,480
Yes, you’re lookin’ for my brass earrings.

576
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,920
But there ain’t no earrings on me.

577
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,240
I’ve been white for a hundred years.

578
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,320
Step down.

579
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,760
I’ve a forty-dollar thirst.”

580
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,640
“You’re certainly white,” began the Virginian.

581
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,560
“But⁠—”

582
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,880
Here the caboose resumed:⁠—

583
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:34,080
“I’m wild, and woolly, and full of peas;I’m hard to curry above the
knees;I’m a she-wolf from Bitter Creek, andIt’s my night to ho‑o‑wl⁠—”

584
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:43,400
And as they howled and stamped, the wheels of the caboose began
to turn gently and to murmur.

585
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,200
The Virginian rose suddenly.

586
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,960
“Will yu’ save that thirst and take a forty-dollar job?”

587
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:55,280
“Missin’ trains, profanity, or what?” said Scipio.

588
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,720
“I’ll tell yu’ soon as I’m sure.”

589
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,640
At this Scipio looked hard at the Virginian.

590
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:06,280
“Why, you’re talkin’ business!” said he, and leaped on the caboose,
where I was already.

591
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:12,240
“I was thinkin’ of Rawhide,” he added, “but I ain’t any more.”


592
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:18,240
“Well, good luck!” said Shorty, on the track behind us.

593
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:28,040
“Oh, say!” said Scipio, “he wanted to go on that train, just
like me.”

594
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,200
“Get on,” called the Virginian.

595
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,800
“But as to getting a job, he ain’t just like you.”

596
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,760
So Shorty came, like a lost dog when you whistle to him.

597
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,360
Our wheels clucked over the mainline switch.

598
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:49,560
A train-hand threw it shut after us, jumped aboard, and returned
forward over the roofs.

599
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:56,360
Inside the caboose they had reached the third howling of the
she-wolf.

600
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:01,680
“Friends of yourn?” said Scipio.

601
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,320
“My outfit,” drawled the Virginian.

602
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,520
“Do yu’ always travel outside?” inquired Scipio.

603
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:15,880
“It’s lonesome in there,” returned the deputy foreman.

604
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,440
And here one of them came out, slamming the door.

605
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,040
“Hell!” he said, at sight of the distant town.

606
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:31,480
Then, truculently, to the Virginian, “I told you I was going
to get a bottle here.”

607
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:37,720
“Have your bottle, then,” said the deputy foreman, and kicked
him off into Dakota.

608
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:45,880
(It was not North Dakota yet; they had not divided it.)

609
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,560
The Virginian had aimed his pistol at about the same time with
his boot.

610
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:55,680
Therefore the man sat in Dakota quietly, watching us go away
into Montana, and offering no objections.

611
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:10,120
Just before he became too small to make out, we saw him rise
and remove himself back toward the saloons.

612
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,920
CHAPTER XV

613
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,880
The Game and the Nation⁠—Act Second

614
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:24,120
“That is the only step I have had to take this whole trip,” said
the Virginian.

615
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,080
He holstered his pistol with a jerk.

616
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,480
“I have been fearing he would force it on me.”

617
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,600
And he looked at empty, receding Dakota with disgust.

618
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,960
“So nyeh back home!” he muttered.

619
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,960
“Known your friend long?” whispered Scipio to me.

620
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,320
“Fairly,” I answered.

621
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:52,480
Scipio’s bleached eyes brightened with admiration as he considered
the Southerner’s back.

622
00:52:52,480 --> 00:53:02,360
“Well,” he stated judicially, “start awful early when yu’ go
to fool with him, or he’ll make you feel unpunctual.”

623
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:11,000
“I expaict I’ve had them almost all of three thousand miles,” said
the Virginian, tilting his head toward the noise in the caboose.

624
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,560
“And I’ve strove to deliver them back as I received them.

625
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,200
The whole lot.

626
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,240
And I would have.

627
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,040
But he has spoiled my hopes.”

628
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,960
The deputy foreman looked again at Dakota.

629
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,640
“It’s a disappointment,” he added.

630
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,080
“You may know what I mean.”

631
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:36,360
I had known a little, but not to the very deep, of the man’s
pride and purpose in this trust.

632
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,360
Scipio gave him sympathy.

633
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:45,680
“There must be quite a balance of ’em left with yu’ yet,” said
Scipio, cheeringly.

634
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:53,440
“I had the boys plumb contented,” pursued the deputy foreman,
hurt into open talk of himself.

635
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:59,880
“Away along as far as Saynt Paul I had them reconciled to my
authority.

636
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:05,280
Then this news about gold had to strike us.”

637
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,920
“And they’re a-dreamin’ nuggets and Parisian bowleyvards,” suggested
Scipio.

638
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,720
The Virginian smiled gratefully at him.

639
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:23,960
“Fortune is shinin’ bright and blindin’ to their delicate young
eyes,” he said, regaining his usual self.

640
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,040
We all listened a moment to the rejoicings within.

641
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:32,600
“Energetic, ain’t they?” said the Southerner.

642
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:37,560
“But none of ’em was whelped savage enough to sing himself bloodthirsty.


643
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:45,760
And though they’re strainin’ mighty earnest not to be tame, they’re
goin’ back to Sunk Creek with me accordin’ to the Judge’s awders

644
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:45,760
.

645
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:54,360
Never a calf of them will desert to Rawhide, for all their dangerousness;
nor I ain’t goin’ to have any fuss over it.

646
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:59,240
Only one is left now that don’t sing.

647
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,160
Maybe I will have to make some arrangements about him.

648
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,080
The man I have parted with,” he said, with another glance

649
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:06,360
at

650
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,240
Dakota

651
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:12,000
, “was our cook, and I will ask yu’ to replace him, Colonel.”


652
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,800
Scipio gaped wide.

653
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,080
“Colonel! Say!”

654
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,440
He stared at the Virginian.

655
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,520
“Did I meet yu’ at the palace?”

656
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:26,320
“Not exackly meet,” replied the Southerner.

657
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,800
“I was present one mawnin’ las’ month when this gentleman awdehed
frawgs’ laigs.”

658
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,400
“Sakes and saints, but that was a mean position!” burst out Scipio.


659
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,160
“I had to tell all comers anything all day.

660
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:45,040
Stand up and jump language hot off my brain at ’em.

661
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:50,000
And the pay don’t near compensate for the drain on the system.


662
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:06,120
I don’t care how good a man is, you let him keep a-tappin’ his presence
of mind right along, without takin’ a layoff, and you’ll have him sick.

663
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,120
Yes, sir.

664
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,480
You’ll hit his nerves.

665
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:28,800
So I told them they could hire some fresh man, for I was goin’ back to punch cattle or fight Indians,
or take a rest somehow, for I didn’t propose to get jaded, and me only twenty-five years old.

666
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:34,920
There ain’t no regular Colonel Cyrus Jones any more, yu’ know.


667
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,240
He met a Cheyenne telegraph pole in seventy-four, and was buried.


668
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:58,560
But his palace was doin’ big business, and he had been a kind of attraction, and so they always
keep a live bear outside, and some poor fello’, fixed up like the Colonel used to be, inside.

669
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,920
And it’s a turruble mean position.

670
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,320
Course I’ll cook for yu’.

671
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,000
Yu’ve a dandy memory for faces!”

672
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:14,440
“I wasn’t right convinced till I kicked him off and you gave
that shut to your eyes again,” said the Virginian.

673
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,680
Once more the door opened.

674
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:29,160
A man with slim black eyebrows, slim black mustache, and a black shirt tied
with a white handkerchief was looking steadily from one to the other of us.

675
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:34,400
“Good day!” he remarked generally and without enthusiasm; and
to the Virginian, “Where’s Schoffner?”

676
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,200
“I expaict he’ll have got his bottle by now, Trampas.”

677
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,760
Trampas looked from one to the other of us again.

678
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,640
“Didn’t he say he was coming back?”

679
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:52,640
“He reminded me he was going for a bottle, and afteh that he
didn’t wait to say a thing.”

680
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,400
Trampas looked at the platform and the railing and the steps.


681
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,480
“He told me he was coming back,” he insisted.

682
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,280
“I don’t reckon he has come, not without he clumb up ahaid somewhere.


683
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:15,240
An’ I mus’ say, when he got off he didn’t look like a man does
when he has the intention o’ returnin’.”

684
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:20,240
At this Scipio coughed, and pared his nails attentively.

685
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,760
We had already been avoiding each other’s eye.

686
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,400
Shorty did not count.

687
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:31,520
Since he got aboard, his meek seat had been the bottom step.

688
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:38,080
The thoughts of Trampas seemed to be in difficulty.

689
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,320
“How long’s this train been started?” he demanded.

690
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,960
“This hyeh train?”

691
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:46,080
The Virginian consulted his watch.

692
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:57,160
“Why, it’s been fanning it a right smart little while,” said
he, laying no stress upon his indolent syllables.

693
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,240
“Huh!” went Trampas.

694
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,720
He gave the rest of us a final unlovely scrutiny.

695
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,960
“It seems to have become a passenger train,” he said.

696
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,960
And he returned abruptly inside the caboose.

697
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,520
“Is he the member who don’t sing?” asked Scipio.

698
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:20,360
“That’s the specimen,” replied the Southerner.

699
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:27,480
“He don’t seem musical in the face,” said Scipio.

700
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,440
“Pshaw!” returned the Virginian.

701
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,600
“Why, you surely ain’t the man to mind ugly mugs when they’re
hollow!”

702
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,040
The noise inside had dropped quickly to stillness.

703
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,480
You could scarcely catch the sound of talk.

704
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:58,840
Our caboose was clicking comfortably westward, rail after rail, mile upon
mile, while night was beginning to rise from earth into the clouded sky.

705
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:07,880
“I wonder if they have sent a search party forward to hunt Schoffner?”
said the Virginian.

706
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,680
“I think I’ll maybe join their meeting.”

707
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,880
He opened the door upon them.

708
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,760
“Kind o’ dark hyeh, ain’t it?” said he.

709
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,000
And lighting the lantern, he shut us out.

710
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,440
“What do yu’ think?” said Scipio to me.

711
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,520
“Will he take them to Sunk Creek?”

712
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,440
“He evidently thinks he will,” said I.

713
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:43,600
“He says he will, and he has the courage of his convictions.”


714
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:50,320
“That ain’t near enough courage to have!” Scipio exclaimed.

715
01:00:50,320 --> 01:01:00,360
“There’s times in life when a man has got to have courage withoutconvictions⁠—without
them⁠—or he is no good.

716
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:11,120
Now your friend is that deep constitooted that you don’t know
and I don’t know what he’s thinkin’ about all this.”

717
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:17,320
“If there’s to be any gunplay,” put in the excellent Shorty,
“I’ll stand in with him.”

718
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:25,600
“Ah, go to bed with your gunplay!” retorted Scipio, entirely
good-humored.

719
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:32,200
“Is the Judge paying for a carload of dead punchers to gather
his beef for him?

720
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:38,600
And this ain’t a proposition worth a man’s gettin’ hurt for himself,
anyway.”

721
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,040
“That’s so,” Shorty assented.

722
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:55,920
“No,” speculated Scipio, as the night drew deeper round us and the caboose click-clucked
and click-clucked over the rail joints; “he’s waitin’ for somebody else to open this pot.

723
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,760
I’ll bet he don’t know but one thing now, and that’s that nobody
else shall know he don’t know anything.”

724
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,880
Scipio had delivered himself.

725
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,160
He lighted a cigarette, and no more wisdom came from him.

726
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,680
The night was established.

727
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,480
The rolling badlands sank away in it.

728
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:23,200
A train-hand had arrived over the roof, and hanging the red lights
out behind, left us again without remark or symptom of curiosity.

729
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:29,880
The train-hands seemed interested in their own society and lived
in their own caboose.

730
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:38,440
A chill wind with wet in it came blowing from the invisible draws,
and brought the feel of the distant mountains

731
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:38,440
.

732
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:43,760
“That’s Montana!” said Scipio, snuffing.

733
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,480
“I am glad to have it inside my lungs again.”

734
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,240
“Ain’t yu’ getting cool out there?” said the Virginian’s voice.


735
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,960
“Plenty room inside.”

736
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:59,880
Perhaps he had expected us to follow him; or perhaps he had
meant us to delay long enough not to seem like a reinforcement.

737
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,000
“These gentlemen missed the express at Medora,” he observed to
his men, simply.

738
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,680
What they took us for upon our entrance I cannot say, or what
they believed.

739
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:15,520
The atmosphere of the caboose was charged with voiceless currents
of thought.

740
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:23,880
By way of a friendly beginning to the three hundred miles of caboose
we were now to share so intimately, I recalled myself to them.

741
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,080
I trusted no more of the Christian Endeavor had delayed them.


742
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,840
“I am so lucky to have caught you again,” I finished.

743
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,320
“I was afraid my last chance of reaching the Judge’s had gone.”


744
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:40,240
Thus I said a number of things designed to be agreeable, but
they met my small talk with the smallest talk you can have.

745
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:48,280
“Yes,” for instance, and “Pretty well, I guess,” and grave strikings
of matches and thoughtful looks at the floor

746
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:48,280
.

747
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:55,680
I suppose we had made twenty miles to the imperturbable clicking of the
caboose when one at length asked his neighbor had he ever seen New York.

748
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,840
“No,” said the other.

749
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,280
“Flooded with dudes, ain’t it?”

750
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,080
“Swimmin’,” said the first.

751
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:06,360
“Leakin’, too,” said a third.

752
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:11,800
“Well, my gracious!” said a fourth, and beat his knee in private
delight.

753
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,800
None of them ever looked at me.

754
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,120
For some reason I felt exceedingly ill at ease.

755
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,360
“Good clothes in New York,” said the third.

756
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,880
“Rich food,” said the first.

757
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,600
“Fresh eggs, too,” said the third.

758
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,440
“Well, my gracious!” said the fourth, beating his knee.

759
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:40,560
“Why, yes,” observed the Virginian, unexpectedly; “they tell me that aiggs
there ain’t liable to be so rotten as yu’ll strike ’em in this country.”

760
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,920
None of them had a reply for this, and New York was abandoned.


761
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,720
For some reason I felt much better.

762
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:49,720
It was a new line they adopted next, led off by Trampas.

763
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,040
“Going to the excitement?” he inquired, selecting Shorty.

764
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,560
“Excitement?” said Shorty, looking up.

765
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,960
“Going to Rawhide?” Trampas repeated.

766
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,680
And all watched Shorty.

767
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,680
“Why, I’m all adrift missin’ that express,” said Shorty.

768
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,880
“Maybe I can give you employment,” suggested the Virginian.

769
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,200
“I am taking an outfit across the basin.”

770
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:18,840
“You’ll find most folks going to Rawhide, if you’re looking for
company,” pursued Trampas, fishing for a recruit.

771
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:24,280
“How about Rawhide, anyway?” said Scipio, skillfully deflecting
this missionary work.

772
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:29,080
“Are they taking much mineral out? Have yu’ seen any of the rock?”


773
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:33,840
“Rock?” broke in the enthusiast who had beaten his knee.

774
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,920
“There!”

775
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,600
And he brought some from his pocket.

776
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:45,600
“You’re always showing your rock,” said Trampas, sulkily; for Scipio
now held the conversation, and Shorty returned safely to his dozing.

777
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,720
“H’m!” went Scipio at the rock.

778
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:55,560
He turned it back and forth in his hand, looking it over; he
chucked and caught it slightingly in the air, and handed it back.

779
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,880
“Porphyry, I see.”

780
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,400
That was his only word about it.

781
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,920
He said it cheerily.

782
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,080
He left no room for discussion.

783
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,680
You could not damn a thing worse.

784
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:14,280
“Ever been in Santa Rita?” pursued Scipio, while the enthusiast
slowly pushed his rock back into his pocket.

785
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,400
“That’s down in New Mexico. Ever been to Globe, Arizona?”

786
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,200
And Scipio talked away about the mines he had known.

787
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,240
There was no getting at Shorty any more that evening.

788
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:29,040
Trampas was foiled of his fish, or of learning how the fish’s
heart lay.

789
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:34,120
And by morning Shorty had been carefully instructed to change
his mind about once an hour.

790
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:38,840
This is apt to discourage all but very superior missionaries.


791
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,400
And I too escaped for the rest of this night.

792
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:53,320
At Glendive we had a dim supper, and I bought some blankets; and
after that it was late, and sleep occupied the attention of us all.

793
01:06:53,320 --> 01:07:02,120
We lay along the shelves of the caboose, a peaceful sight I should
think, in that smoothly trundling cradle.

794
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:14,480
I slept almost immediately, so tired that not even our stops or anything else
waked me, save once, when the air I was breathing grew suddenly pure, and I roused.

795
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,800
Sitting in the door was the lonely figure of the Virginian.

796
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:25,560
He leaned in silent contemplation of the occasional moon, and
beneath it the Yellowstone’s swift ripples.

797
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:33,960
On the caboose shelves the others slept sound and still, each
stretched or coiled as he had first put himself.

798
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:39,000
They were not untrustworthy to look at, it seemed to me⁠—except
Trampas.

799
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:56,640
You would have said the rest of that young humanity was average rough male blood, merely needing to be told the proper things at
the right time; and one big bunchy stocking of the enthusiast stuck out of his blanket, solemn and innocent, and I laughed at it.

800
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:01,360
There was a light sound by the door, and I found the Virginian’s
eye on me.

801
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:06,120
Finding who it was, he nodded and motioned with his hand to go
to sleep.

802
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:13,640
And this I did with him in my sight, still leaning in the open door, through
which came the interrupted moon and the swimming reaches of the Yellowstone.

803
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,760
CHAPTER XVI

804
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,960
THE GAME AND THE NATION⁠—LAST ACT

805
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:24,120
It has happened to you, has it not, to wake in the morning and
wonder for a while where on earth you are?

806
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:32,040
Thus I came half to life in the caboose, hearing voices, but
not the actual words at first.

807
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,720
But presently, “Hathaway!” said someone more clearly.

808
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,280
“Portland 1,291!”

809
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:46,360
This made no special stir in my intelligence, and I drowsed off
again to the pleasant rhythm of the wheels.

810
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:56,520
The little shock of stopping next brought me to, somewhat, with the voices still
round me; and when we were again in motion, I heard: “Rosebud! Portland 1,279!”

811
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:03,960
These figures jarred me awake, and I said, “It was 1,291 before,”
and sat up in my blankets.

812
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:14,120
The greeting they vouchsafed and the sight of them clustering expressionless
in the caboose brought last evening’s uncomfortable memory back to me.

813
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:18,920
Our next stop revealed how things were going today.

814
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,640
“Forsythe,” one of them read on the station.

815
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,960
“Portland 1,266.”

816
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,360
They were counting the lessening distance westward.

817
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:31,400
This was the undercurrent of war.

818
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:39,680
It broke on me as I procured fresh water at Forsythe and made
some toilet in their stolid presence.

819
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:46,960
We were drawing nearer the Rawhide station⁠—the point, I mean,
where you left the railway for the new mines.

820
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,480
Now Rawhide station lay this side of Billings.

821
01:09:51,480 --> 01:10:02,720
The broad path of desertion would open ready for their feet when the narrow
path to duty and Sunk Creek was still some fifty miles more to wait.

822
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:15,920
Here was Trampas’s great strength; he need make no move meanwhile, but lie low for the
immediate temptation to front and waylay them and win his battle over the deputy foreman.

823
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:23,080
But the Virginian seemed to find nothing save enjoyment in this
sunny September morning, and ate his breakfast at Forsythe serenely.

824
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:30,120
That meal done and that station gone, our caboose took up again
its easy trundle by the banks of the Yellowstone.

825
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,320
The mutineers sat for a while digesting in idleness.

826
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:40,000
“What’s your scar?” inquired one at length inspecting casually
the neck of his neighbor.

827
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,800
“Foolishness,” the other answered.

828
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,720
“Yourn?”

829
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:43,480
“Mine.”

830
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:50,040
“Well, I don’t know but I prefer to have myself to thank for
a thing,” said the first.

831
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,440
“I was displaying myself,” continued the second.

832
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,640
“One day last summer it was.

833
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,640
We come on a big snake by Torrey Creek corral.

834
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:15,440
The boys got betting pretty lively that I dassent make my word good as to dealing with him, so I loped my cayuse full tilt by Mr.
Snake, and swung down and catched him up by the tail from the ground, and cracked him same as a whip, and snapped his head off.

835
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,920
You’ve saw it done?” he said to the audience.

836
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,960
The audience nodded wearily.

837
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:28,120
“But the loose head flew agin me, and the fangs caught. I was
pretty sick for a while.”

838
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,760
“It don’t pay to be clumsy,” said the first man.

839
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:40,520
“If you’d snapped the snake away from yu’ instead of toward yu’, its
head would have whirled off into the brush, same as they do with me.”

840
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:44,240
“How like a knife-cut your scar looks!” said I.

841
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,600
“Don’t it?” said the snake-snapper.

842
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,680
“There’s many that gets fooled by it.”

843
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,680
“An antelope knows a snake is his enemy,” said another to me.


844
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:57,120
“Ever seen a buck circling round and round a rattler?”

845
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,040
“I have always wanted to see that,” said I, heartily.

846
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,960
For this I knew to be a respectable piece of truth.

847
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,320
“It’s worth seeing,” the man went on.

848
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:14,560
“After the buck gets close in, he gives an almighty jump up in the air,
and down comes his four hoofs in a bunch right on top of Mr. Snake.

849
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,040
Cuts him all to hash.

850
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,600
Now you tell me how the buck knows that.”

851
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,160
Of course I could not tell him.

852
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:24,720
And again we sat in silence for a while⁠—friendlier silence,
I thought.

853
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:29,200
“A skunk’ll kill yu’ worse than a snake bite,” said another,
presently.

854
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:33,280
“No, I don’t mean that way,” he added.

855
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,240
For I had smiled.

856
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,560
“There is a brown skunk down in Arkansaw.

857
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,680
Kind of prairie-dog brown.

858
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,520
Littler than our variety, he is.

859
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:48,520
And he is mad the whole year round, same as a dog gets.

860
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:58,760
Only the dog has a spell and dies but this here Arkansaw skunk is mad right
along, and it don’t seem to interfere with his business in other respects.

861
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:10,960
Well, suppose you’re camping out, and suppose it’s a hot night, or you’re in a hurry, and you’ve made
camp late, or anyway you haven’t got inside any tent, but you have just bedded down in the open.

862
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:15,160
Skunk comes travelling along and walks on your blankets.

863
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,080
You’re warm.

864
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,280
He likes that, same as a cat does.

865
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,440
And he tramps with pleasure and comfort, same as a cat.

866
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:26,800
And you move.

867
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,280
You get bit, that’s all.

868
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:36,400
And you die of hydrophobia.

869
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,840
Ask anybody.”

870
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,960
“Most extraordinary!” said I.

871
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:52,640
“But did you ever see a person die from this?”

872
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:57,240
“No, sir. Never happened to. My cousin at Bald Knob did.”

873
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,160
“Died?”

874
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,360
“No, sir. Saw a man.”

875
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,280
“But how do you know they’re not sick skunks?”

876
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:03,800
“No, sir!

877
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,960
They’re well skunks.

878
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,160
Well as anything.

879
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:12,600
You’ll not meet skunks in any state of the Union more robust
than them in Arkansaw.

880
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,520
And thick.”

881
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,600
“That’s awful true,” sighed another.

882
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:21,960
“I have buried hundreds of dollars’ worth of clothes in Arkansaw.”


883
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:25,640
“Why didn’t yu’ travel in a sponge bag?” inquired Scipio.

884
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,160
And this brought a slight silence.

885
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:32,840
“Speakin’ of bites,” spoke up a new man, “how’s that?”

886
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:33,720
He held up his thumb.

887
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,520
“My!” breathed Scipio.

888
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,200
“Must have been a lion.”

889
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,640
The man wore a wounded look.

890
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:44,040
“I was huntin’ owl eggs for a botanist from Boston,” he explained
to me.

891
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:48,800
“Chiropodist, weren’t he?” said Scipio.

892
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,120
“Or maybe a sonnabulator?”

893
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:58,000
“No, honest,” protested the man with the thumb; so that I was
sorry for him, and begged him to go on.

894
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,400
“I’ll listen to you,” I assured him.

895
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:05,160
And I wondered why this politeness of mine should throw one or
two of them into stifled mirth.

896
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:14,800
Scipio, on the other hand, gave me a disgusted look and sat back sullenly for a
moment, and then took himself out on the platform, where the Virginian was lounging.

897
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:29,800
“The young feller wore knee-pants and ever so thick spectacles with a half-moon cut in ’em,” resumed the narrator,
“and he carried a tin box strung to a strap I took for his lunch till it flew open on him and a horn toad hustled out.

898
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:34,240
Then I was sure he was a botanist⁠—or whatever yu’ say they’re
called.

899
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:43,520
Well, he would have owl eggs⁠—them little prairie-owl that some claim can
turn their head clean around and keep a-watchin’ yu’, only that’s nonsense.

900
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:55,920
We was ridin’ through that prairie-dog town, used to be on the flat just after yu’ crossed the south fork of Powder
River on the Buffalo trail, and I said I’d dig an owl nest out for him if he was willing to camp till I’d dug it.

901
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:04,840
I wanted to know about them owls some myself⁠—if they did live with
the dogs and snakes, yu’ know,” he broke off, appealing to me.

902
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,760
“Oh, yes,” I told him eagerly.

903
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:19,080
“So while the botanist went glarin’ around the town with his glasses to see if he could spot a
prairie-dog and an owl usin’ the same hole, I was diggin’ in a hole I’d seen an owl run down.

904
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,120
And that’s what I got.”

905
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,600
He held up his thumb again.

906
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,560
“The snake!” I exclaimed.

907
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,520
“Yes, sir.

908
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,240
Mr. Rattler was keepin’ house that day.

909
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,960
Took me right there.

910
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,520
I hauled him out of the hole hangin’ to me.

911
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,880
Eight rattles.”

912
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:37,760
“Eight!” said I.

913
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,520
“A big one.”

914
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:46,600
“Yes, sir. Thought I was dead. But the woman⁠—”

915
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,840
“The woman?” said I.

916
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,840
“Yes, woman.

917
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:54,760
Didn’t I tell yu’ the botanist had his wife along?

918
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,200
Well, he did.

919
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:19,160
And she acted better than the man, for he was losin’ his head, and shoutin’ he had no whiskey, and he didn’t guess his knife was sharp enough to amputate my thumb, and none of us chewed, and
the doctor was twenty miles away, and if he had only remembered to bring his ammonia⁠—well, he was screeching out ’most everything he knew in the world, and without arranging it any, neither.

920
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:23,960
But she just clawed his pocket and burrowed and kep’ yelling,
‘Give him the stone, Augustus!’

921
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:31,880
And she whipped out one of them Injun medicine-stones⁠—first one I ever
seen⁠—and she clapped it on to my thumb, and it started in right away.”

922
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,640
“What did it do?” said I.

923
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,360
“Sucked.

924
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,440
Like blotting-paper does.

925
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,840
Soft and funny it was, and gray.

926
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,040
They get ’em from elks’ stomachs, yu’ know.

927
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:48,400
And when it had sucked the poison out of the wound, off it falls
of my thumb by itself!

928
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,400
And I thanked the woman for saving my life that capable and keeping
her head that cool.

929
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:56,280
I never knowed how excited she had been till afterward.

930
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,600
She was awful shocked.”

931
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:05,200
“I suppose she started to talk when the danger was over,” said
I, with deep silence around me.

932
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:11,240
“No; she didn’t say nothing to me. But when her next child was
born, it had eight rattles.”

933
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,840
Din now rose wild in the caboose.

934
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,600
They rocked together.

935
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,960
The enthusiast beat his knee tumultuously.

936
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,360
And I joined them.

937
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,600
Who could help it?

938
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,960
It had been so well conducted from the imperceptible beginning.


939
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,000
Fact and falsehood blended with such perfect art.

940
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,200
And this last, an effect so new made with such world-old material!


941
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:42,840
I cared nothing that I was the victim, and I joined them; but
ceased, feeling suddenly somehow estranged or chilled.

942
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,400
It was in their laughter.

943
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,520
The loudness was too loud.

944
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:52,680
And I caught the eyes of Trampas fixed upon the Virginian with
exultant malevolence.

945
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:57,440
Scipio’s disgusted glance was upon me from the door.

946
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:04,080
Dazed by these signs, I went out on the platform to get away
from the noise.

947
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:07,400
There the Virginian said to me: “Cheer up!

948
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,480
You’ll not be so easy for ’em that-a-way next season.”

949
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:15,200
He said no more; and with his legs dangled over the railing,
appeared to resume his newspaper.

950
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,320
“What’s the matter?” said I to Scipio.

951
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,560
“Oh, I don’t mind if he don’t,” Scipio answered.

952
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,640
“Couldn’t yu’ see?

953
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:26,120
I tried to head ’em off from yu’ all I knew, but yu’ just ran
in among ’em yourself.

954
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,000
Couldn’t yu’ see?

955
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:35,480
Kep’ hinderin’ and spoilin’ me with askin’ those urgent questions
of yourn⁠—why, I had to let yu’ go your way!

956
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:40,080
Why, that wasn’t the ordinary play with the ordinary tenderfoot
they treated you to!

957
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,560
You ain’t a common tenderfoot this trip.

958
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,720
You’re the foreman’s friend.

959
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,280
They’ve hit him through you.

960
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,520
That’s the way they count it.

961
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,200
It’s made them encouraged.

962
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,000
Can’t yu’ see?”

963
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,440
Scipio stated it plainly.

964
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,400
And as we ran by the next station, “Howard!” they harshly yelled.


965
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,440
“Portland 1256!”

966
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,920
We had been passing gangs of workmen on the track.

967
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:06,600
And at that last yell the Virginian rose.

968
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:10,120
“I reckon I’ll join the meeting again,” he said.

969
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:14,240
“This filling and repairing looks like the washout might have
been true.”

970
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,760
“Washout?” said Scipio.

971
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,920
“Big Horn bridge, they say⁠—four days ago.”

972
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,080
“Then I wish it came this side Rawhide station.”

973
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,120
“Do yu’?” drawled the Virginian.

974
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:28,600
And smiling at Scipio, he lounged in through the open door.

975
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:32,240
“He beats me,” said Scipio, shaking his head.

976
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,560
“His trail is turruble hard to anticipate.”

977
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:36,000
We listened.

978
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,960
“Work bein’ done on the road, I see,” the Virginian was saying,
very friendly and conversational.

979
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,200
“We see it too,” said the voice of Trampas.

980
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,200
“Seem to be easin’ their grades some.”

981
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,200
“Roads do.”

982
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:54,920
“Cheaper to build ’em the way they want ’em at the start, a man
would think,” suggested the Virginian, most friendly.

983
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,240
“There go some more I-talians.”

984
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,960
“They’re Chinese,” said Trampas.

985
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:03,840
“That’s so,” acknowledged the Virginian, with a laugh.

986
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,000
“What’s he monkeyin’ at now?” muttered Scipio.

987
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,480
“Without cheap foreigners they couldn’t afford all this hyeh
new gradin’,” the Southerner continued.

988
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:16,520
“Grading! Can’t you tell when a flood’s been eating the banks?”


989
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:20,640
“Why, yes,” said the Virginian, sweet as honey.

990
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:26,160
“But ’ain’t yu’ heard of the improvements west of Big Timber,
all the way to Missoula, this season?

991
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,640
I’m talkin’ about them.”

992
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,840
“Oh! Talking about them. Yes, I’ve heard.”

993
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,240
“Good money-savin’ scheme, ain’t it?” said the Virginian.

994
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:44,520
“Lettin’ a freight run down one hill an’ up the next as far as
she’ll go without steam, an’ shavin’ the hill down to that point.”

995
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,360
Now this was an honest engineering fact.

996
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:55,800
“Better’n settin’ dudes squintin’ through telescopes and
cipherin’ over one percent reductions,” the Southerner commented.

997
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,520
“It’s common sense,” assented Trampas.

998
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,840
“Have you heard the new scheme about the water-tanks?”

999
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,080
“I ain’t right certain,” said the Southerner.

1000
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:08,800
“I must watch this,” said Scipio, “or I shall bust.”

1001
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,720
He went in, and so did I.

1002
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:19,160
They were all sitting over this discussion of the Northern Pacific’s recent
policy as to betterments, as though they were the board of directors.

1003
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,640
Pins could have dropped.

1004
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:26,360
Only nobody would have cared to hear a pin.

1005
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:34,040
“They used to put all their tanks at the bottom of their grades,”
said Trampas.

1006
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:39,680
“Why, yu’ get the water easier at the bottom.”

1007
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:45,200
“You can pump it to the top, though,” said Trampas, growing superior.


1008
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,080
“And it’s cheaper.”

1009
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,680
“That gets me,” said the Virginian, interested.

1010
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:56,480
“Trains after watering can start down hill now and get the benefit
of the gravity.

1011
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,400
It’ll cut down operating expenses a heap.”

1012
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:04,880
“That’s cert’nly common sense!” exclaimed the Virginian, absorbed.


1013
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,120
“But ain’t it kind o’ tardy?”

1014
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:17,520
“Live and learn. So they gained speed, too. High speed on half
the coal this season, until the accident.”

1015
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,600
“Accident!” said the Virginian, instantly.

1016
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,840
“Yellowstone Limited.

1017
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,640
Man fired at engine driver.

1018
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:33,240
Train was flying past that quick the bullet broke every window
and killed a passenger on the back platform.

1019
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:39,680
You’ve been running too much with aristocrats,” finished Trampas,
and turned on his heel.

1020
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:43,880
“Haw, hew!” began the enthusiast, but his neighbor gripped him
to silence.

1021
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:47,040
This was a triumph too serious for noise.

1022
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:52,160
Not a mutineer moved; and I felt cold.

1023
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:59,200
“Trampas,” said the Virginian, “I thought yu’d be afeared to
try it on me.”

1024
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,240
Trampas whirled round.

1025
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,440
His hand was at his belt.

1026
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,480
“Afraid!” he sneered.

1027
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:14,960
“Shorty!” said Scipio, sternly, and leaping upon that youth,
took his half-drawn pistol from him.

1028
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,040
“I’m obliged to yu’,” said the Virginian to Scipio.

1029
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:21,280
Trampas’s hand left his belt.

1030
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:38,600
He threw a slight, easy look at his men, and keeping his back to the Virginian,
walked out on the platform and sat on the chair where the Virginian had sat so much.

1031
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:52,320
“Don’t you comprehend,” said the Virginian to Shorty, amiably, “that
this hyeh question has been discussed peaceable by civilized citizens?

1032
01:24:52,320 --> 01:25:04,400
Now you sit down and be good, and Mr. Le Moyne will return your gun when we’re
across that broken bridge, if they have got it fixed for heavy trains yet.”

1033
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:10,280
“This train will be lighter when it gets to that bridge,” spoke
Trampas, out on his chair.

1034
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:13,760
“Why, that’s true, too!” said the Virginian.

1035
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:19,080
“Maybe none of us are crossin’ that Big Horn bridge now, except
me.

1036
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:25,560
Funny if yu’ should end by persuadin’ me to quit and go to Rawhide
myself!

1037
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,000
But I reckon I’ll not.

1038
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,520
I reckon I’ll worry along to Sunk Creek, somehow.”

1039
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:38,760
“Don’t forget I’m cookin’ for yu’,” said Scipio, gruffy.

1040
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:42,200
“I’m obliged to yu’,” said the Southerner.

1041
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:46,400
“You were speaking of a job for me,” said Shorty.

1042
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,360
“I’m right obliged.

1043
01:25:48,360 --> 01:26:02,720
But yu’ see⁠—I ain’t exackly foreman the way this comes out,
and my promises might not bind Judge Henry to pay salaries.”

1044
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:05,160
A push came through the train from forward.

1045
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:09,960
We were slowing for the Rawhide station, and all began to be
busy and to talk.

1046
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,560
“Going up to the mines today?”

1047
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,840
“Oh, let’s grub first.”

1048
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,160
“Guess it’s too late, anyway.”

1049
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:31,600
And so forth; while they rolled and roped their bedding, and put on
their coats with a good deal of elbow motion, and otherwise showed off

1050
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:31,600
.

1051
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,720
It was wasted.

1052
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,720
The Virginian did not know what was going on in the caboose.

1053
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:39,880
He was leaning and looking out ahead, and Scipio’s puzzled eye
never left him.

1054
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:48,800
And as we halted for the water-tank, the Southerner exclaimed,
“They ’ain’t got away yet!” as if it were good news to him.

1055
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,280
He meant the delayed trains.

1056
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:58,200
Four stalled expresses were in front of us, besides several freights.


1057
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,520
And two hours more at least before the bridge would be ready.


1058
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:06,880
Travellers stood and sat about forlorn, near the cars, out in
the sagebrush, anywhere.

1059
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:13,720
People in hats and spurs watched them, and Indian chiefs offered
them painted bows and arrows and shiny horns.

1060
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:19,800
“I reckon them passengers would prefer a laig o’ mutton,” said
the Virginian to a man loafing near the caboose.

1061
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,680
“Bet your life!” said the man.

1062
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:26,080
“First lot has been stuck here four days.”

1063
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:30,320
“Plumb starved, ain’t they?” inquired the Virginian.

1064
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:36,880
“Bet your life! They’ve eat up their dining cars and they’ve
eat up this town.”

1065
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:47,000
“Well,” said the Virginian, looking at the town, “I expaict the
dining-cyars contained more nourishment.”

1066
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,120
“Say, you’re about right there!” said the man.

1067
01:27:51,120 --> 01:28:02,400
He walked beside the caboose as we puffed slowly forward from
the water-tank to our siding.

1068
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,320
“Fine business here if we’d only been ready,” he continued.

1069
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,440
“And the Crow agent has let his Indians come over from the reservation.


1070
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,240
There has been a little beef brought in, and game, and fish.

1071
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,080
And big money in it, bet your life!

1072
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,720
Them Eastern passengers has just been robbed.

1073
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:22,800
I wisht I had somethin’ to sell!”

1074
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:27,920
“Anything starting for Rawhide this afternoon?” said Trampas,
out of the caboose door.

1075
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,240
“Not until morning,” said the man.

1076
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,600
“You going to the mines?” he resumed to the Virginian.

1077
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:49,320
“Why,” answered the Southerner, slowly and casually, and addressing himself strictly to the man, while
Trampas, on his side, paid obvious inattention, “this hyeh delay, yu’ see, may unsettle our plans some.

1078
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:55,680
But it’ll be one of two ways⁠—we’re all goin’ to Rawhide, or
we’re all goin’ to Billings.

1079
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,840
We’re all one party, yu’ see.”

1080
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,360
Trampas laughed audibly inside the door as he rejoined his men.


1081
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:06,720
“Let him keep up appearances,” I heard him tell them.

1082
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:12,080
“It don’t hurt us what he says to strangers.”

1083
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:17,680
“But I’m goin’ to eat hearty either way,” continued the Virginian.


1084
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:25,920
“And I ain’ goin’ to be robbed. I’ve been kind o’ promisin’ myself
a treat if we stopped hyeh.”

1085
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,480
“Town’s eat clean out,” said the man.

1086
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,520
“So yu’ tell me.

1087
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:41,200
But all you folks has forgot one source of revenue that yu’ have
right close by, mighty handy.

1088
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:46,400
If you have got a gunny sack, I’ll show you how to make some
money.”

1089
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,080
“Bet your life!” said the man.

1090
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:59,560
“Mr. Le Moyne,” said the Virginian, “the outfit’s cookin’ stuff is aboard,
and if you’ll get the fire ready, we’ll try how frawgs’ laigs go fried.”

1091
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:03,320
He walked off at once, the man following like a dog.

1092
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:06,040
Inside the caboose rose a gust of laughter.

1093
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,240
“Frogs!” muttered Scipio.

1094
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:11,960
And then turning a blank face to me, “Frogs?”

1095
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:15,840
“Colonel Cyrus Jones had them on his bill of fare,” I said.

1096
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,240
“ ‘Frogs’ legs à la Delmonico.’”

1097
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:27,080
“Shoo! I didn’t get up that thing. They had it when I came. Never
looked at it. Frogs?”

1098
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:30,440
He went down the steps very slowly, with a long frown.

1099
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,920
Reaching the ground, he shook his head.

1100
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:38,840
“That man’s trail is surely hard to anticipate,” he said.

1101
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:51,200
“But I must hurry up that fire. For his appearance has given
me encouragement,” Scipio concluded, and became brisk.

1102
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:55,160
Shorty helped him, and I brought wood.

1103
01:30:55,160 --> 01:31:01,200
Trampas and the other people strolled off to the station, a compact
band.

1104
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:10,000
Our little fire was built beside the caboose, so the cooking
things might be easily reached and put back.

1105
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:18,160
You would scarcely think such operations held any interest,
even for the hungry, when there seemed to be nothing to cook.

1106
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:39,320
A few sticks blazing tamely in the dust, a frying-pan, half a tin bucket of lard, some water,
and barren plates and knives and forks, and three silent men attending to them⁠—that was all.

1107
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,640
But the travellers came to see.

1108
01:31:41,640 --> 01:32:01,080
These waifs drew near us, and stood, a sad, lone, shifting fringe of audience; four to begin with;
and then two wandered away; and presently one of these came back, finding it worse elsewhere.

1109
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,840
“Supper, boys?” said he.

1110
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:07,680
“Breakfast,” said Scipio, crossly.

1111
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,200
And no more of them addressed us.

1112
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:19,760
I heard them joylessly mention Wall Street to each other, and
Saratoga; I even heard the name Bryn Mawr, which is near Philadelphia.

1113
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:28,240
But these fragments of home dropped in the wilderness here in
Montana beside a freight caboose were of no interest to me now.

1114
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:31,440
“Looks like frogs down there, too,” said Scipio.

1115
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:35,040
“See them marshy sloos full of weeds?”

1116
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:41,160
We took a little turn and had a sight of the Virginian quite
active among the ponds.

1117
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:44,680
“Hush! I’m getting some thoughts,” continued Scipio.

1118
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:48,160
“He wasn’t sorry enough. Don’t interrupt me.”

1119
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,440
“I’m not,” said I.

1120
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:52,640
“No. But I’d ’most caught ahold.”

1121
01:32:52,640 --> 01:33:01,240
And Scipio muttered to himself again, “He wasn’t sorry enough.”


1122
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:04,760
Presently he swore loud and brilliantly.

1123
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:06,800
“Tell yu’!” he cried.

1124
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:17,200
“What did he say to Trampas after that play they exchanged over
railroad improvements and Trampas put the josh on him?

1125
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:23,360
Didn’t he say, ‘Trampas, I thought you’d be afraid to do it?’


1126
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:27,600
Well, sir, Trampas had better have been afraid.

1127
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,800
And that’s what he meant.

1128
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:33,080
There’s where he was bringin’ it to.

1129
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:38,080
Trampas made an awful bad play then.

1130
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:38,560
You wait.

1131
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,760
Glory, but he’s a knowin’ man!

1132
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,520
Course he wasn’t sorry.

1133
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:48,000
I guess he had the hardest kind of work to look as sorry as he
did.

1134
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,480
You wait.”

1135
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:55,280
“Wait? What for? Go on, man! What for?”

1136
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,720
“I don’t know!

1137
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:57,240
I don’t know!

1138
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:01,560
Whatever hand he’s been holdin’ up, this is the showdown.

1139
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:08,520
He’s played for a showdown here before the caboose gets off the
bridge.

1140
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:13,200
Come back to the fire, or Shorty’ll be leavin’ it go out.

1141
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:21,640
Grow happy some, Shorty!” he cried on arriving, and his hand
cracked on Shorty’s shoulder.

1142
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:26,600
“Supper’s in sight, Shorty. Food for reflection.”

1143
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:31,680
“None for the stomach?” asked the passenger who had spoken once
before.

1144
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,680
“We’re figuring on that too,” said Scipio.

1145
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:37,680
His crossness had melted entirely away.

1146
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:44,840
“Why, they’re cowboys!” exclaimed another passenger; and he moved
nearer.

1147
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:52,000
From the station Trampas now came back, his herd following him
less compactly.

1148
01:34:52,000 --> 01:35:00,160
They had found famine, and no hope of supplies until the next
train from the East.

1149
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:08,240
This was no fault of Trampas’s; but they were following him less
compactly.

1150
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:14,960
They carried one piece of cheese, the size of a fist, the weight
of a brick, the hue of a corpse.

1151
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:21,800
And the passengers, seeing it, exclaimed, “There’s Old Faithful
again!” and took off their hats.

1152
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:26,600
“You gentlemen met that cheese before, then?” said Scipio, delighted.


1153
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:31,480
“It’s been offered me three times a day for four days,” said
the passenger.

1154
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:35,080
“Did he want a dollar or a dollar and a half?”

1155
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:37,760
“Two dollars!” blurted out the enthusiast.

1156
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:43,160
And all of us save Trampas fell into fits of imbecile laughter.


1157
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:48,200
“Here comes our grub, anyway,” said Scipio, looking off toward
the marshes.

1158
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,160
And his hilarity sobered away in a moment.

1159
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:54,040
“Well, the train will be in soon,” stated Trampas.

1160
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:57,000
“I guess we’ll get a decent supper without frogs.”

1161
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,360
All interest settled now upon the Virginian.

1162
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:07,680
He was coming with his man and his gunny sack, and the gunny
sack hung from his shoulder heavily, as a full sack should.

1163
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:12,920
He took no notice of the gathering, but sat down and partly emptied
the sack.

1164
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:18,640
“There,” said he, very businesslike, to his assistant, “that’s
all we’ll want.

1165
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:22,240
I think you’ll find a ready market for the balance.”

1166
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:24,960
“Well, my gracious!” said the enthusiast.

1167
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,400
“What fool eats a frog?”

1168
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:34,160
“Oh, I’m fool enough for a tadpole !” cried the passenger.

1169
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:37,680
And they began to take out their pocketbooks.

1170
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:45,960
“You can cook yours right hyeh, gentlemen,” said the Virginian,
with his slow Southern courtesy.

1171
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:49,960
“The dining-cyars don’t look like they were fired up.”

1172
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:53,560
“How much will you sell a couple for?” inquired the enthusiast.


1173
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:58,920
The Virginian looked at him with friendly surprise.

1174
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:09,840
“Why, help yourself! We’re all together yet awhile. Help yourselves,”
he repeated, to Trampas and his followers.

1175
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:22,200
These hung back a moment, then, with a slinking motion, set the cheese
upon the earth and came forward nearer the fire to receive some supper.

1176
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:32,600
“It won’t scarcely be Delmonico style,” said the Virginian to
the passengers, “nor yet Saynt Augustine.”

1177
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:44,200
He meant the great Augustin, the traditional chef of Philadelphia, whose
history I had sketched for him at Colonel Cyrus Jones’s eating palace.

1178
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:47,160
Scipio now officiated.

1179
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:50,880
His frying-pan was busy, and prosperous odors rose from it.

1180
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:58,680
“Run for a bucket of fresh water, Shorty,” the Virginian continued,
beginning his meal.

1181
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:12,120
“Colonel, yu’ cook pretty near good. If yu’ had sold ’em as advertised,
yu’d have cert’nly made a name.”

1182
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:19,200
Several were now eating with satisfaction, but not Scipio.

1183
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:22,960
It was all that he could do to cook straight.

1184
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,440
The whole man seemed to glisten.

1185
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:33,240
His eye was shut to a slit once more, while the innocent passengers
thankfully swallowed.

1186
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:39,640
“Now, you see, you have made some money,” began the Virginian
to the native who had helped him get the frogs.

1187
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:42,800
“Bet your life!” exclaimed the man.

1188
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,000
“Divvy, won’t you?”

1189
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,640
And he held out half his gains.

1190
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:50,760
“Keep ’em,” returned the Southerner.

1191
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:58,800
“I reckon we’re square. But I expaict they’ll not equal Delmonico’s,
seh?” he said to a passenger.

1192
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:04,920
“Don’t trust the judgment of a man as hungry as I am!” exclaimed
the traveller, with a laugh.

1193
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,800
And he turned to his fellow-travellers.

1194
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:11,840
“Did you ever enjoy supper at Delmonico’s more than this?”

1195
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:12,680
“Never!” they sighed.

1196
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:18,920
“Why, look here,” said the traveller, “what fools the people
of this town are!

1197
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:24,840
Here we’ve been all these starving days, and you come and get
ahead of them!”

1198
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:29,240
“That’s right easy explained,” said the Virginian.

1199
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:33,680
“I’ve been where there was big money in frawgs, and they ’ain’t
been.

1200
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:35,560
They’re all cattle hyeh.

1201
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:40,800
Talk cattle, think cattle, and they’re bankrupt in consequence.


1202
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:41,920
Fallen through.

1203
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:45,280
Ain’t that so?” he inquired of the native.

1204
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,360
“That’s about the way,” said the man.

1205
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:53,640
“It’s mighty hard to do what your neighbors ain’t doin’,” pursued
the Virginian.

1206
01:39:53,640 --> 01:40:11,160
“Montana is all cattle, an’ these folks must be cattle, an’ never notice the country right
hyeh is too small for a range, an’ swampy, anyway, an’ just waitin’ to be a frawg ranch.”

1207
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:14,520
At this, all wore a face of careful reserve.

1208
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:22,600
“I’m not claimin’ to be smarter than you folks hyeh,” said the
Virginian, deprecatingly, to his assistant.

1209
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:25,800
“But travellin’ learns a man many customs.

1210
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:31,080
You wouldn’t do the business they done at Tulare, California,
north side o’ the lake.

1211
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:34,600
They cert’nly utilized them hopeless swamps splendid.

1212
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:45,040
Of course they put up big capital and went into it scientific, gettin’
advice from the government Fish Commission, an’ suchlike knowledge.

1213
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:54,360
Yu’ see, they had big markets for their frawgs⁠—San Francisco, Los
Angeles, and clear to New York afteh the Southern Pacific was through.

1214
01:40:54,360 --> 01:41:00,280
But up hyeh yu’ could sell to passengers every day like yu’ done
this one day.

1215
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:03,400
They would get to know yu’ along the line.

1216
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:06,120
Competing swamps are scarce.

1217
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:14,200
The dining-cyars would take your frawgs, and yu’ would have the
Yellowstone Park for four months in the year.

1218
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:24,200
Them hotels are anxious to please, an’ they would buy off yu’
what their Eastern patrons esteem as fine-eatin’.

1219
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:28,960
And you folks would be sellin’ something instead o’ nothin’.”


1220
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,200
“That’s a practical idea,” said a traveller.

1221
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:32,400
“And little cost.”

1222
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:35,040
“And little cost,” said the Virginian.

1223
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:38,560
“Would Eastern people eat frogs?” inquired the man.

1224
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,960
“Look at us!” said the traveller.

1225
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:45,960
“Delmonico doesn’t give yu’ such a treat!” said the Virginian.


1226
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:48,480
“Not exactly!” the traveller exclaimed.

1227
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:52,280
“How much would be paid for frogs?” said Trampas to him.

1228
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:57,640
And I saw Scipio bend closer to his cooking.

1229
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:01,000
“Oh, I don’t know,” said the traveller.

1230
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,600
“We’ve paid pretty well, you see.”

1231
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,080
“You’re late for Tulare, Trampas,” said the Virginian.

1232
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:10,320
“I was not thinking of Tulare,” Trampas retorted.

1233
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:14,520
Scipio’s nose was in the frying-pan.

1234
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:22,440
“Mos’ comical spot you ever struck!” said the Virginian, looking
round upon the whole company.

1235
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:25,760
He allowed himself a broad smile of retrospect.

1236
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:30,160
“To hear ’em talk frawgs at Tulare!

1237
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:37,480
Same as other folks talks hawsses or steers or whatever they’re
raising to sell.

1238
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:44,720
Yu’d fall into it yourselves if yu’ started the business.

1239
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:53,480
Anything a man’s bread and butter depends on, he’s going to be
earnest about.

1240
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:57,360
Don’t care if it is a frawg.”

1241
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,320
“That’s so,” said the native.

1242
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,200
“And it paid good?”

1243
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:07,520
“The only money in the county was right there,” answered the
Virginian.

1244
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:13,680
“It was a dead county, and only frawgs was movin’.

1245
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:17,280
But that business was a-fannin’ to beat four of a kind

1246
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:17,320
.

1247
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:20,960
It made yu’ feel strange at first, as I said.

1248
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:24,600
For all the men had been cattlemen at one time or another.

1249
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:37,880
Till yu’ got accustomed, it would give ’most anybody a shock to
hear ’em speak about herdin’ the bulls in a pasture by themselves.”

1250
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:43,200
The Virginian allowed himself another smile, but became serious
again.

1251
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:46,960
“That was their policy,” he explained.

1252
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:52,640
“Except at certain times o’ year they kept the bulls separate.


1253
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:58,720
The Fish Commission told ’em they’d better, and it cert’nly worked
mighty well.

1254
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:06,440
It or something did⁠—for, gentlemen, hush! but there was millions.


1255
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:13,000
You’d have said all the frawgs in the world had taken charge
at Tulare.

1256
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,440
And the money rolled in!

1257
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:18,800
Gentlemen, hush!

1258
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,960
’twas a gold mine for the owners.

1259
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,840
Forty percent they netted some years

1260
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:24,840
.

1261
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:26,760
And they paid generous wages.

1262
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:36,720
For they could sell to all them French restaurants in San Francisco,
yu’ see.

1263
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:38,920
And there was the Cliff House.

1264
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:42,760
And the Palace Hotel made it a specialty.

1265
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:52,120
And the officers took frawgs at the Presidio, an’ Angel Island,
an’ Alcatraz, an’ Benicia.

1266
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:55,560
Los Angeles was beginnin’ its boom.

1267
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:59,080
The corner-lot sharps wanted something by way of varnish.

1268
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:05,680
An’ so they dazzled Eastern investors with advertisin’ Tulare
frawgs clear to New Orleans an’ New York.

1269
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:09,560
’Twas only in Sacramento frawgs was dull.

1270
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:16,840
I expaict the California legislature was too or’n’ry for them
fine-raised luxuries.

1271
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:27,000
They tell of one of them senators that he raked a million out of Los
Angeles real estate, and started in for a bang-up meal with champagne.

1272
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,360
Wanted to scatter his new gold thick an’ quick.

1273
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:41,760
But he got astray among all the fancy dishes, an’ just yelled right out
before the ladies, ‘Damn it! bring me forty dollars’ worth of ham and aiggs.’

1274
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:44,000
He was a funny senator, now.”

1275
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,680
The Virginian paused, and finished eating a leg.

1276
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:53,680
And then with diabolic art he made a feint at wandering to new
fields of anecdote.

1277
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:59,080
“Talkin’ of senators,” he resumed, “Senator Wise⁠—”

1278
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:07,520
“How much did you say wages were at Tulare?” inquired one of
the Trampas faction.

1279
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:16,040
“How much? Why, I never knew what the foreman got. The regular
hands got a hundred. Senator Wise⁠—”

1280
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:17,240
“A hundred a month?”

1281
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:21,760
“Why, it was wet an’ muddy work, yu’ see.

1282
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:24,320
A man risked rheumatism some.

1283
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:25,520
He risked it a good deal.

1284
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:29,400
Well, I was going to tell about Senator Wise.

1285
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:33,520
When Senator Wise was speaking of his visit to Alaska⁠—”

1286
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:36,760
“Forty percent, was it?” said Trampas.

1287
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:42,160
“Oh, I must call my wife,” said the traveller behind me.

1288
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:44,480
“This is what I came West for.”

1289
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,200
And he hurried away.

1290
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:52,160
“Not forty percent the bad years ,” replied the Virginian.

1291
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:56,440
“The frawgs had enemies, same as cattle.

1292
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:02,040
I remember when a pelican got in the spring pasture, and the
herd broke through the fence⁠—”

1293
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:04,160
“Fence?” said a passenger.

1294
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:06,160
“Ditch, seh, and wire net.

1295
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:12,400
Every pasture was a square swamp with a ditch around, and a wire
net.

1296
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:17,280
Yu’ve heard the mournful, mixed-up sound a big bunch of cattle
will make?

1297
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:24,320
Well, seh, as yu’ druv from the railroad to the Tulare frawg
ranch yu’ could hear ’em a mile.

1298
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:30,240
Springtime they’d sing like girls in the organ loft, and by August
they were about ready to hire out for bass.

1299
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:37,680
And all was fit to be soloists, if I’m a judge.

1300
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:41,840
But in a bad year it might only be twenty percent.

1301
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:50,000
The pelican rushed ’em from the pasture right into the San Joaquin
River, which was close by the property.

1302
01:47:50,000 --> 01:48:05,720
The big balance of the herd stampeded, and though of course they came out on the banks again,
the news had went around, and folks below at Hemlen eat most of ’em just to spite the company.

1303
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:13,680
Yu’ see, a frawg in a river is more hopeless than any maverick
loose on the range.

1304
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:20,160
And they never struck any plan to brand their stock and prove
ownership.”

1305
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:27,080
“Well, twenty percent is good enough for me,” said Trampas, “if
Rawhide don’t suit me.”

1306
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:31,560
“A hundred a month!” said the enthusiast.

1307
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:35,120
And busy calculations began to arise among them.

1308
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:43,280
“It went to fifty percent,” pursued the Virginian, “when New
York and Philadelphia got to biddin’ agaynst each other.

1309
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:50,920
Both cities had signs all over ’em claiming to furnish the Tulare
frawg.

1310
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:52,320
And both had ’em all right.

1311
01:48:52,320 --> 01:49:08,760
And same as cattle trains, yu’d see frawg trains tearing acrosst Arizona⁠—big
glass tanks with wire over ’em⁠—through to New York, an’ the frawgs starin’ out.”

1312
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:16,200
“Why, George,” whispered a woman’s voice behind me, “he’s merely
deceiving them!

1313
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:22,720
He’s merely making that stuff up out of his head.”

1314
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:26,000
“Yes, my dear, that’s merely what he’s doing.”

1315
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:33,840
“Well, I don’t see why you imagined I should care for this. I
think I’ll go back.”

1316
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:40,040
“Better see it out, Daisy. This beats the geysers or anything
we’re likely to find in the Yellowstone.”

1317
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:47,080
“Then I wish we had gone to Bar Harbor as usual,” said the lady,
and she returned to her Pullman.

1318
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:49,040
But her husband stayed.

1319
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:56,560
Indeed, the male crowd now was a goodly sight to see, how the
men edged close, drawn by a common tie.

1320
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:08,040
Their different kinds of feet told the strength of the bond⁠—yellow sleeping-car
slippers planted miscellaneous and motionless near a pair of Mexican spurs.

1321
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:13,040
All eyes watched the Virginian and gave him their entire sympathy.


1322
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:26,160
Though they could not know his motive for it, what he was doing
had fallen as light upon them⁠—all except the excited calculators.

1323
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:41,240
These were loudly making their fortunes at both Rawhide and Tulare, drugged by
their satanically aroused hopes of gold, heedless of the slippers and the spurs.

1324
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:46,840
Had a man given any sign to warn them, I think he would have
been lynched.

1325
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:53,120
Even the Indian chiefs had come to see in their show war bonnets
and blankets.

1326
01:50:53,120 --> 01:51:01,520
They naturally understood nothing of it, yet magnetically knew
that the Virginian was the great man.

1327
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:03,320
And they watched him with approval.

1328
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:10,200
He sat by the fire with the frying-pan, looking his daily self⁠—engaging
and saturnine.

1329
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:24,040
And now as Trampas declared tickets to California would be dear and Rawhide
had better come first, the Southerner let loose his heaven-born imagination.

1330
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:29,920
“There’s a better reason for Rawhide than tickets, Trampas,”
said he.

1331
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:34,160
“I said it was too late for Tulare.”

1332
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:37,800
“I heard you,” said Trampas.

1333
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:44,200
“Opinions may differ. You and I don’t think alike on several
points.”

1334
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:52,120
“Gawd, Trampas!” said the Virginian, “d’ yu’ reckon I’d be
rotting hyeh on forty dollars if Tulare was like it used to be?

1335
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:54,480
Tulare is broke.”

1336
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:56,800
“What broke it? Your leaving?”

1337
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:03,400
“Revenge broke it, and disease,” said the Virginian, striking
the frying-pan on his knee, for the frogs were all gone.

1338
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:11,600
At those lurid words their untamed child minds took fire, and
they drew round him again to hear a tale of blood.

1339
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,040
The crowd seemed to lean nearer.

1340
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:19,520
But for a short moment it threatened to be spoiled.

1341
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:28,640
A passenger came along, demanding in an important voice, “Where
are these frogs?”

1342
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:34,560
He was a prominent New York after-dinner speaker, they whispered
me, and out for a holiday in his private car.

1343
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:43,800
Reaching us and walking to the Virginian, he said cheerily, “How
much do you want for your frogs, my friend?”

1344
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:47,040
“You got a friend hyeh?” said the Virginian.

1345
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:50,520
“That’s good, for yu’ need care taken of yu’.”

1346
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:57,600
And the prominent after-dinner speaker did not further discommode
us.

1347
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:02,920
“That’s worth my trip,” whispered a New York passenger to me.


1348
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:08,880
“Yes, it was a case of revenge,” resumed the Virginian, “and
disease.

1349
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:13,920
There was a man named Saynt Augustine got run out of Domingo,
which is a Dago island.

1350
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,920
He come to Philadelphia, an’ he was dead broke.

1351
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:25,600
But Saynt Augustine was a live man, an’ he saw Philadelphia was
full o’ Quakers that dressed plain an’ eat humdrum.

1352
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:31,480
So he started cookin’ Domingo way for ’em, an’ they caught right
ahold.

1353
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:39,000
Terrapin, he gave ’em, an’ croakeets, an’ he’d use forty chickens
to make a broth he called consommay.

1354
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,240
An’ he got rich, and Philadelphia got well known, an’ Delmonico
in New York he got jealous.

1355
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:48,640
He was the cook that had the say-so in New York.”

1356
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:53,280
“Was Delmonico one of them I-talians?” inquired a fascinated
mutineer.

1357
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:58,480
“I don’t know. But he acted like one. Lorenzo was his front name.
He aimed to cut⁠—”

1358
01:53:58,480 --> 01:53:59,560
“Domingo’s throat?” breathed the enthusiast.

1359
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:04,440
“Aimed to cut away the trade from Saynt Augustine an’ put Philadelphia
back where he thought she belonged.

1360
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:06,080
Frawgs was the fashionable rage then.

1361
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:09,600
These foreign cooks set the fashion in eatin’, same as foreign
dressmakers do women’s clothes.

1362
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:17,040
Both cities was catchin’ and swallowin’ all the frawgs Tulare
could throw at ’em.

1363
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:18,640
So he⁠—”

1364
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:21,080
“Lorenzo?” said the enthusiast.

1365
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:23,280
“Yes, Lorenzo Delmonico.

1366
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:26,200
He bid a dollar a tank higher.

1367
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:29,600
An’ Saynt Augustine raised him fifty cents.

1368
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:30,360
An’

1369
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:31,360
Lorenzo raised him a dollar.

1370
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:33,960
An’ Saynt Augustine shoved her up three.

1371
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:52,520
Lorenzo he didn’t expect Philadelphia would go that high, and he got hot in the collar, an’ flew round his
kitchen in New York, an’ claimed he’d twist Saynt Augustine’s Domingo tail for him and crack his ossified system.

1372
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:55,280
Lorenzo raised his language to a high temperature, they say.

1373
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:58,440
An’ then quite sudden off he starts for Tulare.

1374
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:05,320
He buys tickets over the Santa Fe, and he goes a-fannin’ and
a-foggin’.

1375
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:08,240
But, gentlemen, hush!

1376
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:14,880
The very same day Saynt Augustine he tears out of Philadelphia.


1377
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:22,880
He travelled by the way o’ Washington, an’ out he comes a-fannin’
an’ a-foggin’ over the Southern Pacific.

1378
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,480
Of course Tulare didn’t know nothin’ of this.

1379
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:34,400
All it knowed was how the frawg market was on soarin’ wings,
and it was feelin’ like a flight o’ rawckets.

1380
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:41,240
If only there’d been some preparation⁠—a telegram or something⁠—the
disaster would never have occurred.

1381
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:59,040
But Lorenzo and Saynt Augustine was that absorbed watchin’ each other⁠—for, yu’ see, the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific come together
at Mojave, an’ the two cooks travelled a matter of two hundred an’ ten miles in the same cyar⁠—they never thought about a telegram.

1382
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:11,120
And when they arruv, breathless, an’ started in to screechin’ what they’d
give for the monopoly, why, them unsuspectin’ Tulare boys got amused at ’em.

1383
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:25,600
I never heard just all they done, but they had Lorenzo singin’
and dancin’, while Saynt Augustine played the fiddle for him.

1384
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:29,760
And one of Lorenzo’s heels did get a trifle grazed.

1385
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:45,920
Well, them two cooks quit that ranch without disclosin’ their identity, and soon as they
got to a safe distance they swore eternal friendship, in their excitable foreign way.

1386
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:51,360
And they went home over the Union Pacific, sharing the same stateroom.


1387
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,360
Their revenge killed frawgs.

1388
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:54,600
The disease⁠—”

1389
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:57,360
“How killed frogs?” demanded Trampas.

1390
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,600
“Just killed ’em.

1391
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:08,000
Delmonico and Saynt Augustine wiped frawgs off the slate of fashion.


1392
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:15,800
Not a banker in Fifth Avenue’ll touch one now if another banker’s
around watchin’ him.

1393
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:28,360
And if ever yu’ see a man that hides his feet an’ won’t take off his
socks in company, he has worked in them Tulare swamps an’ got the disease.

1394
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:32,920
Catch him wadin’, and yu’ll find he’s web-footed.

1395
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:36,920
Frawgs are dead, Trampas, and so are you.”

1396
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:40,400
“Rise up, liars, and salute your king!” yelled Scipio.

1397
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,920
“Oh, I’m in love with you!”

1398
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:46,240
And he threw his arms round the Virginian.

1399
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:53,520
“Let me shake hands with you,” said the traveller, who had failed
to interest his wife in these things.

1400
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:56,320
“I wish I was going to have more of your company.”

1401
01:57:56,320 --> 01:58:00,120
“Thank yu’, seh,” said the Virginian.

1402
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:11,000
Other passengers greeted him, and the Indian chiefs came, saying,
“How!” because they followed their feelings without understanding.

1403
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,800
“Don’t show so humbled, boys,” said the deputy foreman to his
most sheepish crew.

1404
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,280
“These gentlemen from the East have been enjoying yu’ some, I
know.

1405
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:19,840
But think what a weary wait they have had hyeh.

1406
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:25,120
And you insisted on playing the game with me this way, yu’ see.


1407
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:27,160
What outlet did yu’ give me?

1408
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:29,040
Didn’t I have it to do?

1409
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:36,640
And I’ll tell yu’ one thing for your consolation: when I got
to the middle of the frawgs I ’most believed it myself.”

1410
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:40,080
And he laughed out the first laugh I had heard him give.

1411
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:43,800
The enthusiast came up and shook hands.

1412
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:48,160
That led off, and the rest followed, with Trampas at the end.


1413
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:51,200
The tide was too strong for him.

1414
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:59,680
He was not a graceful loser; but he got through this, and the Virginian
eased him down by treating him precisely like the others⁠—apparently.

1415
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:13,160
Possibly the supreme⁠—the most American⁠—moment of all was when word came that the bridge
was open, and the Pullman trains, with noise and triumph, began to move westward at last.

1416
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:25,280
Everyone waved farewell to everyone, craning from steps and windows, so that the cars twinkled
with hilarity; and in twenty minutes the whole procession in front had moved, and our turn came.

1417
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:27,360
“Last chance for Rawhide,” said the Virginian.

1418
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:31,800
“Last chance for Sunk Creek,” said a reconstructed mutineer,
and all sprang aboard.

1419
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:35,400
There was no question who had won his spurs now.

1420
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:56,480
Our caboose trundled on to Billings along the shingly cotton-wooded Yellowstone; and as the plains and bluffs and the distant
snow began to grow well known, even to me, we turned to our baggage that was to come off, since camp would begin in the morning.

1421
01:59:56,480 --> 02:00:06,800
Thus I saw the Virginian carefully rewrapping Kenilworth, that he might bring it to its owner
unharmed; and I said, “Don’t you think you could have played poker with Queen Elizabeth?”

1422
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:10,200
“No; I expaict she’d have beat me,” he replied.

1423
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:11,200
“She was a lady.”

1424
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:15,120
It was at Billings, on this day, that I made those reflections
about equality.

1425
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:21,040
For the Virginian had been equal to the occasion: that is the
only kind of equality which I recognize.

1426
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,800
CHAPTER XVII

1427
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,120
Scipio Moralizes

1428
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:28,080
Into what mood was it that the Virginian now fell?

1429
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:33,760
Being less busy, did he begin to “grieve” about the girl on Bear
Creek?

1430
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:37,520
I only know that after talking so lengthily he fell into a nine
days’ silence.

1431
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:41,280
The talking part of him deeply and unbrokenly slept.

1432
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:48,440
Official words of course came from him as we rode southward from
the railroad, gathering the Judge’s stray cattle.

1433
02:00:48,440 --> 02:01:00,280
During the many weeks since the spring roundup, some of these animals had as usual got very
far off their range, and getting them on again became the present business of our party.

1434
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:09,560
Directions and commands⁠—whatever communications to his
subordinates were needful to the forwarding of this⁠—he duly gave.

1435
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:13,960
But routine has never at any time of the world passed for conversation.


1436
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:41,840
His utterances, such as, “We’ll work Willo’ Creek tomorro’ mawnin’,” or, “I want the wagon to be at the fawks o’ Stinkin’
Water by Thursday,” though on some occasions numerous enough to sound like discourse, never once broke the man’s true silence.

1437
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:47,040
Seeming to keep easy company with the camp, he yet kept altogether
to himself.

1438
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:58,080
That talking part of him⁠—the mood which brings out for you your friend’s spirit and mind
as a free gift or as an exchange⁠—was down in some dark cave of his nature, hidden away.

1439
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:01,280
Perhaps it had been dreaming; perhaps completely reposing.

1440
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:07,560
The Virginian was one of those rare ones who are able to refresh
themselves in sections.

1441
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:12,880
To have a thing on his mind did not keep his body from resting.


1442
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:36,440
During our recent journey⁠—it felt years ago now!⁠—while our caboose on the freight train had trundled endlessly westward, and
the men were on the ragged edge, the very jumping-off place, of mutiny and possible murder, I had seen him sleep like a child.

1443
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:38,960
He snatched the moments not necessary for vigil.

1444
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:46,520
I had also seen him sit all night watching his responsibility,
ready to spring on it and fasten his teeth in it.

1445
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:54,920
And now that he had confounded them with their own attempted
weapon of ridicule, his powers seemed to be profoundly dormant.

1446
02:02:54,920 --> 02:03:03,000
That final pitched battle of wits had made the men his captives
and admirers⁠—all save Trampas.

1447
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,720
And of him the Virginian did not seem to be aware.

1448
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:11,200
But Scipio le Moyne would say to me now and then, “If I was Trampas,
I’d pull my freight.”

1449
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:17,520
And once he added, “Pull it kind of casual, yu’ know, like I
wasn’t noticing myself do it.”

1450
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:23,920
“Yes,” our friend Shorty murmured pregnantly, with his eye upon
the quiet Virginian, “he’s sure studying his revenge.”

1451
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:26,640
“Studying your pussycat,” said Scipio.

1452
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:30,400
“He knows what he’ll do. The time ain’t arrived.”

1453
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:36,280
This was the way they felt about it; and not unnaturally this was
the way they made me, the inexperienced Easterner, feel about it.

1454
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:39,840
That Trampas also felt something about it was easy to know.

1455
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:49,800
Like the leaven which leavens the whole lump, one spot of sulkiness in camp will spread its dull
flavor through any company that sits near it; and we had to sit near Trampas at meals for nine days.

1456
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:51,640
His sullenness was not wonderful.

1457
02:03:51,640 --> 02:04:01,600
To feel himself forsaken by his recent adherents, to see them gone
over to his enemy, could not have made his reflections pleasant.

1458
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:41,560
Why he did not take himself off to other climes⁠—“pull his freight casual,” as Scipio said⁠—I can explain only thus: pay was due him⁠—“time,” as it was called in cow-land; if he would have this money, he must stay under the Virginian’s command
until the Judge’s ranch on Sunk Creek should be reached; meanwhile, each day’s work added to the wages in store for him; and finally, once at Sunk Creek, it would be no more the Virginian who commanded him; it would be the real ranch foreman.

1459
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:51,920
At the ranch he would be the Virginian’s equal again, both of them
taking orders from their officially recognized superior, this foreman.

1460
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:59,520
Shorty’s word about “revenge” seemed to me like putting the thing
backwards.

1461
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:08,440
Revenge, as I told Scipio, was what I should be thinking about
if I were Trampas.

1462
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:12,560
“He dassent,” was Scipio’s immediate view.

1463
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:14,640
“Not till he’s got strong again.

1464
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:22,680
He got laughed plumb sick by the bystanders, and whatever spirit
he had was broke in the presence of us all.

1465
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:25,120
He’ll have to recuperate.”

1466
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:28,040
Scipio then spoke of the Virginian’s attitude.

1467
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:32,640
“Maybe revenge ain’t just the right word for where this affair
has got to now with him.

1468
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:41,400
When yu’ beat another man at his own game like he done to Trampas,
why, yu’ve had all the revenge yu’ can want, unless you’re a hog.

1469
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:42,840
And he’s no hog.

1470
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:46,200
But he has got it in for Trampas.

1471
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,680
They’ve not reckoned to a finish.

1472
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:57,280
Would you let a man try such spite-work on you and quit thinkin’
about him just because yu’d headed him off?”

1473
02:05:57,280 --> 02:06:02,200
To this I offered his own notion about hogs and being satisfied.


1474
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:12,880
“Hogs!” went on Scipio, in a way that dashed my suggestion to
pieces; “hogs ain’t in the case.

1475
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:17,280
He’s got to deal with Trampas somehow⁠—man to man.

1476
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:24,960
Trampas and him can’t stay this way when they get back and go
workin’ same as they worked before.

1477
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:37,640
No, sir; I’ve seen his eye twice, and I know he’s goin’ to reckon
to a finish.”

1478
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:54,280
I still must, in Scipio’s opinion, have been slow to understand, when on the afternoon following this talk I
invited him to tell me what sort of “finish” he wanted, after such a finishing as had been dealt Trampas already.

1479
02:06:54,280 --> 02:07:02,040
Getting “laughed plumb sick by the bystanders” (I borrowed his own
not overstated expression) seemed to me a highly final finishing.

1480
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:11,240
While I was running my notions off to him, Scipio rose, and,
with the frying-pan he had been washing, walked slowly at me.

1481
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:18,200
“I do believe you’d oughtn’t to be let travel alone the way you
do.”

1482
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:19,440
He put his face close to mine.

1483
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:26,760
His long nose grew eloquent in its shrewdness, while the fire
in his bleached blue eye burned with amiable satire.

1484
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:33,400
“What has come and gone between them two has only settled the
one point he was aimin’ to make.

1485
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:38,720
He was appointed boss of this outfit in the absence of the regular
foreman.

1486
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:50,640
Since then all he has been playin’ for is to hand back his men to the ranch in as good shape as they’d
been handed to him, and without losing any on the road through desertion or shooting or whatnot.

1487
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:58,760
He had to kick his cook off the train that day, and the loss
made him sorrowful, I could see.

1488
02:07:58,760 --> 02:08:06,600
But I’d happened to come along, and he jumped me into the vacancy,
and I expect he is pretty near consoled.

1489
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:11,160
And as boss of the outfit he beat Trampas, who was settin’ up
for opposition boss.

1490
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:20,280
And the outfit is better than satisfied it come out that way, and they’re stayin’
with him; and he’ll hand them all back in good condition, barrin’ that lost cook.

1491
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:23,240
So for the present his point is made, yu’ see.

1492
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:24,360
But look ahead a little.

1493
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:27,640
It may not be so very far ahead yu’ll have to look.

1494
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,120
We get back to the ranch.

1495
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:32,240
He’s not boss there any more.

1496
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:34,600
His responsibility is over.

1497
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:43,120
He is just one of us again, taking orders from a foreman they
tell me has showed partiality to Trampas more’n a few times.

1498
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:45,320
Partiality!

1499
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:48,120
That’s what Trampas is plainly trusting to.

1500
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:53,560
Trusting it will fix him all right and fix his enemy all wrong.


1501
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:58,440
He’d not otherwise dare to keep sour like he’s doing.

1502
02:08:58,440 --> 02:08:59,680
Partiality!

1503
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:02,440
D’ yu’ think it’ll scare off the enemy?”

1504
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:09,680
Scipio looked across a little creek to where the Virginian was
helping throw the gathered cattle on the bedground.

1505
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:19,640
“What odds”⁠—he pointed the frying-pan at the Southerner⁠—“d’ yu’ figure
Trampas’s being under any foreman’s wing will make to a man like him?

1506
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:29,680
He’s going to remember Mr. Trampas and his spite-work if he’s got to tear
him out from under the wing, and maybe tear off the wing in the operation.

1507
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:43,440
And I am goin’ to advise your folks,” ended the complete Scipio, “not
to leave you travel so much alone⁠—not till you’ve learned more life

1508
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:43,760
.”

1509
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:59,080
He had made me feel my inexperience, convinced me of innocence, undoubtedly; and during the final days of our journey
I no longer invoked his aid to my reflections upon this especial topic: What would the Virginian do to Trampas?

1510
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:12,880
Would it be another intellectual crushing of him, like the frog story, or would
there be something this time more material⁠—say muscle, or possibly gunpowder⁠—in it?

1511
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:15,760
And was Scipio, after all, infallible?

1512
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:25,560
I didn’t pretend to understand the Virginian; after several years’
knowledge of him he remained utterly beyond me.

1513
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:31,480
Scipio’s experience was not yet three weeks long.

1514
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:46,920
So I let him alone as to all this, discussing with him most other things good and evil in the world, and
being convinced of much further innocence; for Scipio’s twenty odd years were indeed a library of life.

1515
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:58,800
I have never met a better heart, a shrewder wit, and looser morals, with
yet a native sense of decency and duty somewhere hard and fast enshrined.

1516
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:13,680
But all the while I was wondering about the Virginian: eating with him, sleeping
with him (only not so sound as he did), and riding beside him often for many hours.

1517
02:11:13,680 --> 02:11:18,480
Experiments in conversation I did make⁠—and failed.

1518
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:47,760
One day particularly while, after a sudden storm of hail had chilled the earth numb and white like winter in fifteen minutes, we sat drying
and warming ourselves by a fire that we built, I touched upon that theme of equality on which I knew him to hold opinions as strong as mine.

1519
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:59,600
“Oh,” he would reply, and “Cert’nly”; and when I asked him what it was in
a man that made him a leader of men, he shook his head and puffed his pipe.

1520
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:14,240
So then, noticing how the sun had brought the earth in half an hour
back from winter to summer again, I spoke of our American climate.

1521
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:21,040
It was a potent drug, I said, for millions to be swallowing every
day.

1522
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:25,360
“Yes,” said he, wiping the damp from his Winchester rifle.

1523
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:33,240
Our American climate, I said, had worked remarkable changes,
at least.

1524
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:37,160
“Yes,” he said; and did not ask what they were.

1525
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:39,720
So I had to tell him.

1526
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:44,000
“It has made successful politicians of the Irish.

1527
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:44,760
That’s one.

1528
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:50,160
And it has given our whole race the habit of poker.”

1529
02:12:50,160 --> 02:12:52,720
Bang went his Winchester.

1530
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:54,200
The bullet struck close to my left.

1531
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:55,040
I sat up angrily.

1532
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:58,480
“That’s the first foolish thing I ever saw you do!” I said.

1533
02:12:58,480 --> 02:13:02,520
“Yes,” he drawled slowly, “I’d ought to have done it sooner.

1534
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:05,400
He was pretty near lively again.”

1535
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:09,240
And then he picked up a rattlesnake six feet behind me.

1536
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:15,120
It had been numbed by the hail, part revived by the sun, and
he had shot its head off.

1537
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:15,800
CHAPTER XVIII

1538
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:17,000
“Would You Be a Parson?”

1539
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:20,840
After this I gave up my experiments in conversation.

1540
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:43,440
So that by the final afternoon of our journey, with Sunk Creek actually in sight, and the great grasshoppers slatting their dry song over the
sagebrush, and the time at hand when the Virginian and Trampas would be “man to man,” my thoughts rose to a considerable pitch of speculation.

1541
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:53,240
And now that talking part of the Virginian, which had been nine
days asleep, gave its first yawn and stretch of waking.

1542
02:13:53,240 --> 02:13:58,000
Without preface, he suddenly asked me, “Would you be a parson?”


1543
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:07,840
I was mentally so far away that I couldn’t get back in time to
comprehend or answer before he had repeated:⁠—

1544
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:10,000
“What would yu’ take to be a parson?”

1545
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:17,720
He drawled it out in his gentle way, precisely as if no nine
days stood between it and our last real intercourse.

1546
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:18,320
“Take?”

1547
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:20,560
I was still vaguely moving in my distance.

1548
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:21,960
“How?”

1549
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:25,640
His next question brought me home.

1550
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:30,160
“I expect the Pope’s is the biggest of them parson jobs?”

1551
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:34,120
It was with an “Oh!” that I now entirely took his idea.

1552
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:36,480
“Well, yes; decidedly the biggest.”

1553
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:43,320
“Beats the English one? Archbishop⁠—ain’t it?⁠—of Canterbury?
The Pope comes ahead of him?”

1554
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:47,680
“His Holiness would say so if his Grace did not.”

1555
02:14:47,680 --> 02:15:04,520
The Virginian turned half in his saddle to see my face⁠—I was, at the moment, riding
not quite abreast of him⁠—and I saw the gleam of his teeth beneath his mustache.

1556
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:11,800
It was seldom I could make him smile, even to this slight extent.


1557
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:18,520
But his eyes grew, with his next words, remote again in their
speculation.

1558
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:20,920
“His Holiness and his Grace.

1559
02:15:20,920 --> 02:15:27,080
Now if I was to hear ’em namin’ me that-a-way every mawnin’,
I’d sca’cely get down to business.”

1560
02:15:27,080 --> 02:15:29,000
“Oh, you’d get used to the pride of it.”

1561
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,280
“ ’Tisn’t the pride.

1562
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:32,840
The laugh is what would ruin me.

1563
02:15:32,840 --> 02:15:36,720
’Twould take ’most all my attention keeping a straight face.

1564
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:46,480
The Archbishop”⁠—here he took one of his wide mental turns⁠—“is
apt to be a big man in them Shakespeare plays.

1565
02:15:46,480 --> 02:15:55,640
Kings take talk from him they’d not stand from anybody else;
and he talks fine, frequently.

1566
02:15:55,640 --> 02:16:01,160
About the bees, for instance, when Henry is going to fight France.


1567
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:05,320
He tells him a beehive is similar to a kingdom.

1568
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:08,160
I learned that piece.”

1569
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:15,360
The Virginian could not have expected to blush at uttering these
last words.

1570
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:23,160
He knew that his sudden color must tell me in whose book it was
he had learned the piece.

1571
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:31,840
Was not her copy of Kenilworth even now in his cherishing pocket?


1572
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:40,840
So he now, to cover his blush, very deliberately recited to me
the Archbishop’s discourse upon bees and their kingdom:⁠—

1573
02:16:40,840 --> 02:17:03,960
“ ‘Where some, like magistrates, correct at home.⋮Others, like soldiers, armèd in their stings,Make loot upon the summer’s velvet buds;Which pillage
they with merry march bring homeTo the tent-royal of their emperor:He, busied in his majesty, surveysThe singing masons building roofs of gold.’

1574
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:10,680
“Ain’t that a fine description of bees a-workin’? ‘The singing
masons building roofs of gold!’

1575
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:14,920
Puts ’em right before yu’, and is poetry without bein’ foolish.


1576
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:17,160
His Holiness and his Grace.

1577
02:17:17,160 --> 02:17:21,760
Well, they could not hire me for either o’ those positions.

1578
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:23,680
How many religions are there?”

1579
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:25,240
“All over the earth?”

1580
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:32,840
“Yu’ can begin with ourselves. Right hyeh at home I know there’s
Romanists, and Episcopals⁠—”

1581
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:34,760
“Two kinds!” I put in.

1582
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:37,360
“At least two of Episcopals.”

1583
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:41,880
“That’s three. Then Methodists and Baptists, and⁠—”

1584
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:43,200
“Three Methodists!”

1585
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:46,640
“Well, you do the countin’.”

1586
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:53,200
I accordingly did it, feeling my revolving memory slip cogs all
the way round.

1587
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:55,760
“Anyhow, there are safely fifteen.”

1588
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:56,720
“Fifteen.”

1589
02:17:56,720 --> 02:17:59,320
He held this fact a moment.

1590
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:05,480
“And they don’t worship a whole heap o’ different gods like the
ancients did?”

1591
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:07,480
“Oh, no!”

1592
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:09,600
“It’s just the same one?”

1593
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:10,600
“The same one.”

1594
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:21,160
The Virginian folded his hands over the horn of his saddle, and leaned
forward upon them in contemplation of the wide, beautiful landscape.

1595
02:18:21,160 --> 02:18:23,960
“One God and fifteen religions ,” was his reflection.

1596
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:27,680
“That’s a right smart of religions for just one God.”

1597
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:34,560
This way of reducing it was, if obvious to him, so novel to me that my laugh
evidently struck him as a louder and livelier comment than was required.

1598
02:18:34,560 --> 02:18:38,880
He turned on me as if I had somehow perverted the spirit of his
words.

1599
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:45,960
“I ain’t religious. I know that. But I ain’t unreligious. And
I know that too.”

1600
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:49,520
“So do I know it, my friend.”

1601
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:53,840
“Do you think there ought to be fifteen varieties of good people?”


1602
02:18:53,840 --> 02:19:00,680
His voice, while it now had an edge that could cut anything it
came against, was still not raised.

1603
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:01,320
“There ain’t fifteen.

1604
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:01,920
There ain’t two.

1605
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:03,240
There’s one kind.

1606
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:06,240
And when I meet it, I respect it.

1607
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:16,000
It is not praying nor preaching that has ever caught me and made me ashamed of
myself, but one or two people I have knowed that never said a superior word to me.

1608
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:21,760
They thought more o’ me than I deserved, and that made me behave
better than I naturally wanted to.

1609
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:28,560
Made me quit a girl onced in time for her not to lose her good
name.

1610
02:19:28,560 --> 02:19:31,800
And so that’s one thing I have never done.

1611
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:44,480
And if ever I was to have a son or somebody I set store by, I would wish their lot
to be to know one or two good folks mighty well⁠—men or women⁠—women preferred.”

1612
02:19:44,480 --> 02:19:51,520
He had looked away again to the hills behind Sunk Creek ranch,
to which our walking horses had now almost brought us.

1613
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:59,960
“As for parsons”⁠—the gesture of his arm was a disclaiming
one⁠—“I reckon some parsons have a right to tell yu’ to be good.

1614
02:19:59,960 --> 02:20:05,040
The bishop of this hyeh Territory has a right.

1615
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:14,920
But I’ll tell yu’ this: a middlin’ doctor is a pore thing, and a middlin’
lawyer is a pore thing; but keep me from a middlin’ man of God.”

1616
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:21,760
Once again he had reduced it, but I did not laugh this time.

1617
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:30,000
I thought there should in truth be heavy damages for malpractice
on human souls.

1618
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:37,600
But the hot glow of his words, and the vision of his deepest
inner man it revealed, faded away abruptly.

1619
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:41,040
“What do yu’ make of the proposition yondeh?”

1620
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:47,960
As he pointed to the cause of this question he had become again
his daily, engaging, saturnine self.

1621
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:54,840
Then I saw over in a fenced meadow, to which we were now close,
what he was pleased to call “the proposition.”

1622
02:20:54,840 --> 02:21:07,680
Proposition in the West does, in fact, mean whatever you at the moment please⁠—an
offer to sell you a mine, a cloudburst, a glass of whiskey, a steamboat.

1623
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:17,520
This time it meant a stranger clad in black, and of a clerical deportment which
would in that atmosphere and to a watchful eye be visible for a mile or two.

1624
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:23,520
“I reckoned yu’ hadn’t noticed him,” was the Virginian’s reply
to my ejaculation.

1625
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:33,160
“Yes. He set me goin’ on the subject a while back. I expect he
is another missionary to us pore cowboys.”

1626
02:21:33,160 --> 02:21:40,440
I seemed from a hundred yards to feel the stranger’s forceful
personality.

1627
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:45,800
It was in his walk⁠—I should better say stalk⁠—as he promenaded
along the creek.

1628
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:53,960
His hands were behind his back, and there was an air of waiting,
of displeased waiting, in his movement.

1629
02:21:53,960 --> 02:22:08,400
“Yes, he’ll be a missionary,” said the Virginian, conclusively; and he took to singing,
or rather to whining, with his head tilted at an absurd angle upward at the sky:⁠—

1630
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:14,880
“ ‘Dar is a big Car’lina nigger,About de size of dis chile or
p’raps a little bigger,By de name of Jim Crow.

1631
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:17,240
Dat what de white folks call him.

1632
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:33,840
If ever I sees him I ’tends for to maul him,Just to let de white folks
seeSuch an animos as heCan’t walk around the streets and scandalize me.’”

1633
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:44,320
The lane which was conducting us to the group of ranch buildings now turned
a corner of the meadow, and the Virginian went on with his second verse:⁠—

1634
02:22:44,320 --> 02:22:46,160
“ ‘Great big fool, he hasn’t any knowledge.

1635
02:22:46,160 --> 02:22:46,640
Gosh!

1636
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:56,240
how could he, when he’s never been to scollege?Neither has I.But
I’se come mighty nigh;I peaked through de door as I went by.’”

1637
02:22:56,240 --> 02:23:02,800
He was beginning a third stanza, but stopped short; a horse had
neighed close behind us.

1638
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:06,840
“Trampas,” said he, without turning his head, “we are home.”

1639
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:09,760
“It looks that way.”

1640
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:14,320
Some ten yards were between ourselves and Trampas, where he followed.


1641
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:19,520
“And I’ll trouble yu’ for my rope yu’ took this mawnin’ instead
o’ your own.”

1642
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:21,960
“I don’t know as it’s your rope I’ve got.”

1643
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:27,800
Trampas skilfully spoke this so that a precisely opposite meaning
flowed from his words.

1644
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:30,800
If it was discussion he tried for, he failed.

1645
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:40,640
The Virginian’s hand moved, and for one thick, flashing moment
my thoughts were evidently also the thoughts of Trampas.

1646
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:45,960
But the Virginian only held out to Trampas the rope which he
had detached from his saddle.

1647
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:48,040
“Take your hand off your gun, Trampas.

1648
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:53,040
If I had wanted to kill yu’ you’d be lying nine days back on
the road now.

1649
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:54,120
Here’s your rope.

1650
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:56,000
Did yu’ expect I’d not know it?

1651
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,680
It’s the only one in camp the stiffness ain’t all drug out of
yet.

1652
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:04,800
Or maybe yu’ expected me to notice and⁠—not take notice?”

1653
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:09,400
“I don’t spend my time in expectations about you. If⁠—”

1654
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:12,360
The Virginian wheeled his horse across the road.

1655
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:17,400
“Yu’re talkin’ too soon after reachin’ safety, Trampas.

1656
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:22,840
I didn’t tell yu’ to hand me that rope this mawnin’, because
I was busy.

1657
02:24:22,840 --> 02:24:26,960
I ain’t foreman now; and I want that rope.”

1658
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:30,480
Trampas produced a smile as skilful as his voice.

1659
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:35,760
“Well, I guess your having mine proves this one is yours.”

1660
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:41,120
He rode up and received the coil which the Virginian held out,
unloosing the disputed one on his saddle.

1661
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:48,600
If he had meant to devise a slippery, evasive insult, no small trick in
cow-land could be more offensive than this taking another man’s rope.

1662
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:51,960
And it is the small tricks which lead to the big bullets.

1663
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:57,960
Trampas put a smooth coating of plausibility over the whole transaction.


1664
02:24:57,960 --> 02:25:06,800
“After the rope corral we had to make this morning”⁠—his tone was mock
explanatory⁠—“the ropes was all strewed round camp, and in the hustle I⁠—”

1665
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:11,800
“Pardon me,” said a sonorous voice behind us, “do you happen
to have seen Judge Henry?”

1666
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:14,920
It was the reverend gentleman in his meadow, come to the fence.


1667
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:21,800
As we turned round to him he spoke on, with much rotund authority
in his eye.

1668
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:27,120
“From his answer to my letter, Judge Henry undoubtedly expects
me here.

1669
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:34,600
I have arrived from Fetterman according to my plan which I announced to
him, to find that he has been absent all day⁠—absent the whole day.”

1670
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:46,920
The Virginian sat sidewise to talk, one long, straight leg supporting him on one
stirrup, the other bent at ease, the boot half lifted from its dangling stirrup.

1671
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:51,960
He made himself the perfection of courtesy.

1672
02:25:51,960 --> 02:25:56,080
“The Judge is frequently absent all night, seh.”

1673
02:25:56,080 --> 02:26:02,360
“Scarcely tonight, I think. I thought you might know something
about him.”

1674
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:04,360
“I have been absent myself, seh.”

1675
02:26:04,360 --> 02:26:07,160
“Ah! On a vacation, perhaps?”

1676
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:09,720
The divine had a ruddy facet.

1677
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:29,880
His strong glance was straight and frank and fearless; but his smile too much reminded me of days bygone, when we used to return to school from
the Christmas holidays, and the masters would shake our hands and welcome us with: “Robert, John, Edward, glad to see you all looking so well!

1678
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:35,360
Rested, and ready for hard work, I’m sure!”

1679
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:43,000
That smile does not really please even good, tame little boys;
and the Virginian was nearing thirty.

1680
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:52,640
“It has not been vacation this trip, seh,” said he, settling
straight in his saddle.

1681
02:26:52,640 --> 02:27:01,080
“There’s the Judge driving in now, in time for all questions
yu’ have to ask him.”

1682
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:04,240
His horse took a step, but was stopped short.

1683
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:08,360
There lay the Virginian’s rope on the ground.

1684
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:20,960
I had been aware of Trampas’s quite proper departure during the talk; and as he was leaving,
I seemed also to be aware of his placing the coil across the cantle of its owner’s saddle.

1685
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:26,960
Had he intended it to fall and have to be picked up?

1686
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:32,320
It was another evasive little business, and quite successful,
if designed to nag the owner of the rope.

1687
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:38,960
A few hundred yards ahead of us Trampas was now shouting loud
cowboy shouts.

1688
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:44,680
Were they to announce his return to those at home, or did they
mean derision?

1689
02:27:44,680 --> 02:27:54,000
The Virginian leaned, keeping his seat, and, swinging down his arm,
caught up the rope, and hung it on his saddle somewhat carefully.

1690
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,600
But the hue of rage spread over his face.

1691
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:02,440
From his fence the divine now spoke, in approbation, but with
another strong, cheerless smile.

1692
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:05,840
“You pick up that rope as if you were well trained to it.”

1693
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:10,720
“It’s part of our business, seh, and we try to mind it like the
rest.”

1694
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:16,880
But this, stated in a gentle drawl, did not pierce the missionary’s
armor; his superiority was very thick.

1695
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:24,440
We now rode on, and I was impressed by the reverend gentleman’s robust,
dictatorial back as he proceeded by a shortcut through the meadow to the ranch.

1696
02:28:24,440 --> 02:28:31,360
You could take him for nothing but a vigorous, sincere, dominating
man, full of the highest purpose.

1697
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:43,120
But whatever his creed, I already doubted if he were the right
one to sow it and make it grow in these new, wild fields.

1698
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:50,760
He seemed more the sort of gardener to keep old walks and vines
pruned in their antique rigidity.

1699
02:28:50,760 --> 02:29:00,400
I admired him for coming all this way with his clean, short,
gray whiskers and his black, well-brushed suit.

1700
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:04,880
And he made me think of a powerful locomotive stuck puffing on
a grade.

1701
02:29:04,880 --> 02:29:15,720
Meanwhile, the Virginian rode beside me, so silent in his volcanic
wrath that I did not perceive it.

1702
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:22,440
The missionary coming on top of Trampas had been more than he
could stand.

1703
02:29:22,440 --> 02:29:26,160
But I did not know, and I spoke with innocent cheeriness.

1704
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:30,960
“Is the parson going to save us?” I asked; and I fairly jumped
at his voice:⁠—

1705
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:33,840
“Don’t talk so much!” he burst out.

1706
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:36,280
I had got the whole accumulation!

1707
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:39,440
“Who’s been talking?” I in equal anger screeched back.

1708
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:43,400
“I’m not trying to save you. I didn’t take your rope.”

1709
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:47,560
And having poured this out, I whipped up my pony.

1710
02:29:47,560 --> 02:29:56,000
But he spurred his own alongside of me; and glancing at him,
I saw that he was now convulsed with internal mirth.

1711
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:00,920
I therefore drew down to a walk, and he straightened into gravity.


1712
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:17,080
“I’m right obliged to yu’,” he laid his hand in its buckskin gauntlet upon
my horse’s mane as he spoke, “for bringing me back out o’ my nonsense.

1713
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:20,880
I’ll be as serene as a bird now⁠—whatever they do.

1714
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:29,520
A man,” he stated reflectively, “any full-sized man, ought to
own a big lot of temper.

1715
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:37,680
And like all his valuable possessions, he’d ought to keep it
and not lose any.”

1716
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:38,960
This was his full apology.

1717
02:30:38,960 --> 02:30:52,400
“As for salvation, I have got this far: somebody,” he swept an arm
at the sunset and the mountains, “must have made all that, I know.

1718
02:30:52,400 --> 02:31:06,560
But I know one more thing I would tell Him to His face: if I can’t do nothing long enough and good
enough to earn eternal happiness, I can’t do nothing long enough and bad enough to be damned.

1719
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:12,960
I reckon He plays a square game with us if He plays at all, and
I ain’t bothering my haid about other worlds.”

1720
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:24,560
As we reached the stables, he had become the serene bird he promised,
and was sentimentally continuing:⁠—

1721
02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:38,720
“ ‘De sun is made of mud from de bottom of de river;De moon is made o’ fox-fire, as you might disciver;De
stars like de ladies’ eyes,All round de world dey flies,To give a little light when de moon don’t rise.’ ”

1722
02:31:38,720 --> 02:31:46,480
If words were meant to conceal our thoughts, melody is perhaps
a still thicker veil for them.

1723
02:31:46,480 --> 02:31:50,120
Whatever temper he had lost

1724
02:31:50,120 --> 02:32:00,320
, he had certainly found again; but this all the more fitted
him to deal with Trampas, when the dealing should begin.

1725
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:09,080
I had half a mind to speak to the Judge, only it seemed beyond
a mere visitor’s business.

1726
02:32:09,080 --> 02:32:15,360
Our missionary was at this moment himself speaking to Judge Henry
at the door of the home ranch.

1727
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:20,240
“I reckon he’s explaining he has been awaiting.”

1728
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:24,800
The Virginian was throwing his saddle off as I loosened the cinches
of mine.

1729
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:28,320
“And the Judge don’t look like he was hopelessly distressed.”


1730
02:32:28,320 --> 02:32:38,000
I now surveyed the distant parley, and the Judge, from the wagonful of guests whom he had
evidently been driving upon a day’s excursion, waved me a welcome, which I waved back.

1731
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,400
“He’s got Miss Molly Wood there!” I exclaimed.

1732
02:32:40,400 --> 02:32:40,920
“Yes.”

1733
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:42,360
The Virginian was brief about this fact.

1734
02:32:42,360 --> 02:32:47,880
“I’ll look afteh your saddle. You go and get acquainted with
the company.”

1735
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:59,880
This favor I accepted; it was the means he chose for saying he hoped,
after our recent boiling over, that all was now more than right between us.

1736
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:11,760
So for the while I left him to his horses, and his corrals, and
his Trampas, and his foreman, and his imminent problem.

1737
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:13,400
CHAPTER XIX

1738
02:33:13,400 --> 02:33:16,600
Dr. Macbride Begs Pardon

1739
02:33:16,600 --> 02:33:28,640
Judge and Mrs. Henry, Molly Wood, and two strangers, a lady and a gentleman,
were the party which had been driving in the large three-seated wagon.

1740
02:33:28,640 --> 02:33:31,200
They had seemed a merry party.

1741
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:40,800
But as I came within hearing of their talk, it was a fragment
of the minister’s sonority which reached me first:⁠—

1742
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:50,440
“… more opportunity for them to have the benefit of hearing frequent
sermons,” was the sentence I heard him bring to completion.

1743
02:33:50,440 --> 02:33:52,560
“Yes, to be sure, sir.”

1744
02:33:52,560 --> 02:34:00,520
Judge Henry gave me (it almost seemed) additional warmth of welcome
for arriving to break up the present discourse.

1745
02:34:00,520 --> 02:34:07,360
“Let me introduce you to the Rev. Dr. Alexander MacBride.

1746
02:34:07,360 --> 02:34:18,080
Doctor, another guest we have been hoping for about this time,”
was my host’s cordial explanation to him of me.

1747
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:26,600
There remained the gentleman with his wife from New York, and
to these I made my final bows.

1748
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:30,240
But I had not broken up the discourse.

1749
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:34,280
“We may be said to have met already.”

1750
02:34:34,280 --> 02:34:48,920
Dr. MacBride had fixed upon me his full, mastering eye; and it occurred to me that
if they had policemen in heaven, he would be at least a centurion in the force.

1751
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:57,400
But he did not mean to be unpleasant; it was only that in a mind
full of matters less worldly, pleasure was left out.

1752
02:34:57,400 --> 02:35:02,600
“I observed your friend was a skilful horseman,” he continued.


1753
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:10,200
“I was saying to Judge Henry that I could wish such skilful horsemen
might ride to a church upon the Sabbath.

1754
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:17,800
A church, that is, of right doctrine, where they would have opportunity
to hear frequent sermons.”

1755
02:35:17,800 --> 02:35:19,080
“Yes,” said Judge Henry, “yes.

1756
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:21,520
It would be a good thing.”

1757
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:25,040
Mrs. Henry, with some murmur about the kitchen, here went into
the house.

1758
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:35,840
“I was informed,” Dr. MacBride held the rest of us, “before undertaking
my journey that I should find a desolate and mainly godless country.

1759
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:47,760
But nobody gave me to understand that from Medicine Bow I was
to drive three hundred miles and pass no church of any faith.”

1760
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:53,040
The Judge explained that there had been a few a long way to the
right and left of him.

1761
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:54,960
“Still,” he conceded, “you are quite right.

1762
02:35:54,960 --> 02:35:59,080
But don’t forget that this is the newest part of a new world.”


1763
02:35:59,080 --> 02:36:08,200
“Judge,” said his wife, coming to the door, “how can you keep
them standing in the dust with your talking?”

1764
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:12,520
This most efficiently did break up the discourse.

1765
02:36:12,520 --> 02:36:29,880
As our little party, with the smiles and the polite holdings back of new acquaintanceship, moved into the house,
the Judge detained me behind all of them long enough to whisper dolorously, “He’s going to stay a whole week.”

1766
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:39,720
I had hopes that he would not stay a whole week when I presently learned of the
crowded arrangements which our hosts, with many hospitable apologies, disclosed to us.

1767
02:36:39,720 --> 02:36:45,000
They were delighted to have us, but they hadn’t foreseen that
we should all be simultaneous.

1768
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:50,080
The foreman’s house had been prepared for two of us, and did
we mind?

1769
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:57,200
The two of us were Dr. MacBride and myself; and I expected him
to mind.

1770
02:36:57,200 --> 02:36:59,320
But I wronged him grossly.

1771
02:36:59,320 --> 02:37:10,720
It would be much better, he assured Mrs. Henry, than straw in a
stable, which he had tried several times, and was quite ready for.

1772
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:19,320
So I saw that though he kept his vigorous body clean when he
could, he cared nothing for it in the face of his mission.

1773
02:37:19,320 --> 02:37:34,440
How the foreman and his wife relished being turned out during a week for a missionary and myself was
not my concern, although while he and I made ready for supper over there, it struck me as hard on them.

1774
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:46,880
The room with its two cots and furniture was as nice as possible; and we closed
the door upon the adjoining room, which, however, seemed also untenanted.

1775
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:54,960
Mrs. Henry gave us a meal so good that I have remembered it, and her
husband the Judge strove his best that we should eat it in merriment.

1776
02:37:54,960 --> 02:38:10,240
He poured out his anecdotes like wine, and we should have quickly warmed to them; but Dr. MacBride sat among us,
giving occasional heavy ha-ha’s, which produced, as Miss Molly Wood whispered to me, a “dreadfully cavernous effect.”

1777
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:15,800
Was it his sermon, we wondered, that he was thinking over?

1778
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:24,000
I told her of the copious sheaf of them I had seen him pull from
his wallet over at the foreman’s.

1779
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,440
“Goodness!” said she.

1780
02:38:25,440 --> 02:38:27,840
“Then are we to hear one every evening?”

1781
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:33,440
This I doubted; he had probably been picking one out suitable
for the occasion.

1782
02:38:33,440 --> 02:38:40,480
“Putting his best foot foremost,” was her comment; “I suppose
they have best feet, like the rest of us.”

1783
02:38:40,480 --> 02:38:41,800
Then she grew delightfully sharp.

1784
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:46,720
“Do you know, when I first heard him I thought his voice was
hearty.

1785
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:48,960
But if you listen, you’ll find it’s merely militant.

1786
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:50,600
He never really meets you with it.

1787
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:54,680
He’s off on his hill watching the battlefield the whole time.”


1788
02:38:54,680 --> 02:38:58,400
“He will find a hardened pagan here.”

1789
02:38:58,400 --> 02:38:59,160
“Judge Henry?”

1790
02:38:59,160 --> 02:39:02,520
“Oh, no! The wild man you’re taming brought you Kenilworth safe
back.”

1791
02:39:02,520 --> 02:39:03,080
She was smooth.

1792
02:39:03,080 --> 02:39:07,440
“Oh, as for taming him! But don’t you find him intelligent?”

1793
02:39:07,440 --> 02:39:11,480
Suddenly I somehow knew that she didn’t want to tame him.

1794
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:13,840
But what did she want to do?

1795
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:17,640
The thought of her had made him blush this afternoon.

1796
02:39:17,640 --> 02:39:21,400
No thought of him made her blush this evening.

1797
02:39:21,400 --> 02:39:32,760
A great laugh from the rest of the company made me aware that
the Judge had consummated his tale of the “Sole Survivor.”

1798
02:39:32,760 --> 02:39:38,760
“And so,” he finished, “they all went off as mad as hops because
it hadn’t been a massacre.”

1799
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:51,520
Mr. and Mrs. Ogden⁠—they were the New Yorkers⁠—gave this story much applause, and Dr.
MacBride half a minute later laid his “ha-ha,” like a heavy stone, upon the gaiety.

1800
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:55,560
“I’ll never be able to stand seven sermons,” said Miss Wood to
me.

1801
02:39:55,560 --> 02:40:04,040
“Talking of massacres,”⁠—I now hastened to address the already
saddened table⁠—“I have recently escaped one myself.”

1802
02:40:04,040 --> 02:40:06,880
The Judge had come to an end of his powers.

1803
02:40:06,880 --> 02:40:10,080
“Oh, tell us!” he implored.

1804
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:21,400
“Seriously, sir, I think we grazed pretty wet tragedy but your
extraordinary man brought us out into comedy safe and dry.”

1805
02:40:21,400 --> 02:40:58,680
This gave me their attention; and, from that afternoon in Dakota when I had first stepped aboard the caboose, I told them the whole tale of my experience: how I grew immediately aware that all was not right, by the Virginian’s kicking the cook
off the train; how, as we journeyed, the dark bubble of mutiny swelled hourly beneath my eyes; and how, when it was threatening I know not what explosion, the Virginian had pricked it with humor, so that it burst in nothing but harmless laughter.

1806
02:40:58,680 --> 02:41:25,560
Their eyes followed my narrative: the New Yorkers, because such events do not happen upon the shores of the Hudson; Mrs. Henry, because she was my hostess; Miss Wood
followed for whatever her reasons were⁠—I couldn’t see her eyes; rather, I felther listening intently to the deeds and dangers of the man she didn’t care to tame.

1807
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:37,120
But it was the eyes of the Judge and the missionary which I saw riveted upon me
indeed until the end; and they forthwith made plain their quite dissimilar opinions.

1808
02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:40,360
Judge Henry struck the table lightly with his fist.

1809
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:41,400
“I knew it!”

1810
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:43,640
And he leaned back in his chair with a face of contentment.

1811
02:41:43,640 --> 02:41:46,680
He had trusted his man, and his man had proved worthy.

1812
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:47,480
“Pardon me.”

1813
02:41:47,480 --> 02:41:53,320
Dr. MacBride had a manner of saying “pardon me,” which rendered
forgiveness well-nigh impossible.

1814
02:41:53,320 --> 02:41:55,400
The Judge waited for him.

1815
02:41:55,400 --> 02:42:10,120
“Am I to understand that these⁠—a⁠—cowboys attempted to mutiny, and were discouraged in this
attempt upon finding themselves less skilful at lying than the man they had plotted to depose?”

1816
02:42:10,120 --> 02:42:10,600
I began an answer.

1817
02:42:10,600 --> 02:42:18,520
“It was other qualities, sir, that happened to be revealed and
asserted by what you call his lying that⁠—”

1818
02:42:18,520 --> 02:42:21,120
“And what am I to call it, if it is not lying?

1819
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:26,120
A competition in deceit in which, I admit, he out did them.

1820
02:42:26,120 --> 02:42:27,960
“It’s their way to⁠—”

1821
02:42:27,960 --> 02:42:34,360
“Pardon me. Their way to lie? They bow down to the greatest in
this?”

1822
02:42:34,360 --> 02:42:37,840
“Oh,” said Miss Wood in my ear, “give him up.”

1823
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:40,320
The Judge took a turn.

1824
02:42:40,320 --> 02:42:42,800
“We-ell, Doctor⁠—” He seemed to stick here.

1825
02:42:42,800 --> 02:42:45,280
Mr. Ogden handsomely assisted him.

1826
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:47,120
“You’ve said the word yourself, Doctor.

1827
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:50,440
It’s the competition, don’t you see?

1828
02:42:50,440 --> 02:42:53,880
The trial of strength by no matter what test.”

1829
02:42:53,880 --> 02:42:56,240
“Yes,” said Miss Wood, unexpectedly.

1830
02:42:56,240 --> 02:43:00,840
“And it wasn’t that George Washington couldn’t tell a lie.

1831
02:43:00,840 --> 02:43:02,040
He just wouldn’t.

1832
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:10,400
I’m sure if he’d undertaken to he’d have told a much better one
than Cornwall’s.”

1833
02:43:10,400 --> 02:43:14,160
“Ha-ha, madam! You draw an ingenious subtlety from your books.”


1834
02:43:14,160 --> 02:43:17,120
“It’s all plain to me,” Ogden pursued.

1835
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:18,880
“The men were morose.

1836
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:21,480
This foreman was in the minority.

1837
02:43:21,480 --> 02:43:26,960
He cajoled them into a bout of tall stories, and told the tallest
himself.

1838
02:43:26,960 --> 02:43:35,080
And when they found they had swallowed it whole⁠—well, it would
certainly take the starch out of me,” he concluded.

1839
02:43:35,080 --> 02:43:40,400
“I couldn’t be a serious mutineer after that.”

1840
02:43:40,400 --> 02:43:43,280
Dr. MacBride now sounded his strongest bass.

1841
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:43,960
“Pardon me.

1842
02:43:43,960 --> 02:43:46,960
I cannot accept such a view, sir.

1843
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:49,360
There is a levity abroad in our land which I must deplore.

1844
02:43:49,360 --> 02:43:58,800
No matter how leniently you may try to put it, in the end we have the spectacle
of a struggle between men where lying decides the survival of the fittest.

1845
02:43:58,800 --> 02:44:06,800
Better, far better, if it was to come, that they had shot honest
bullets.

1846
02:44:06,800 --> 02:44:09,640
There are worse evils than war.”

1847
02:44:09,640 --> 02:44:12,520
The Doctor’s eye glared righteously about him.

1848
02:44:12,520 --> 02:44:23,560
None of us, I think, trembled; or, if we did, it was with emotions
other than fear.

1849
02:44:23,560 --> 02:44:41,000
Mrs. Henry at once introduced the subject of trout-fishing, and thus happily removed us from the edge
of whatever sort of precipice we seemed to have approached; for Dr. MacBride had brought his rod.

1850
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:53,120
He dilated upon this sport with fervor, and we assured him that the streams
upon the west slope of the Bow Leg Mountains would afford him plenty of it.

1851
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:58,440
Thus we ended our meal in carefully preserved amity.

1852
02:44:58,440 --> 02:45:00,360
CHAPTER XX

1853
02:45:00,360 --> 02:45:03,480
The Judge Ignores Particulars

1854
02:45:03,480 --> 02:45:10,200
“Do you often have these visitations?” Ogden inquired of Judge
Henry.

1855
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:27,480
Our host was giving us whiskey in his office, and Dr. MacBride, while we smoked apart from the ladies,
had repaired to his quarters in the foreman’s house previous to the service which he was shortly to hold.

1856
02:45:27,480 --> 02:45:28,360
The Judge laughed.

1857
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:31,880
“They come now and then through the year.

1858
02:45:31,880 --> 02:45:33,640
I like the bishop to come.

1859
02:45:33,640 --> 02:45:36,200
And the men always like it.

1860
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:41,680
But I fear our friend will scarcely please them so well.”

1861
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:42,360
“You don’t mean they’ll⁠—”

1862
02:45:42,360 --> 02:45:42,880
“Oh, no.

1863
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:44,040
They’ll keep quiet.

1864
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:47,960
The fact is, they have a good deal better manners than he has,
if he only knew it.

1865
02:45:47,960 --> 02:45:50,520
They’ll be able to bear him.

1866
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:53,440
But as for any good he’ll do⁠—”

1867
02:45:53,440 --> 02:45:59,440
“I doubt if he knows a word of science,” said I, musing about
the Doctor.

1868
02:45:59,440 --> 02:46:10,600
“Science! He doesn’t know what Christianity is yet. I’ve entertained many guests, but
none⁠—The whole secret,” broke off Judge Henry, “lies in the way you treat people.

1869
02:46:10,600 --> 02:46:16,320
As soon as you treat men as your brothers, they are ready to
acknowledge you⁠—if you deserve it⁠—as their superior.

1870
02:46:16,320 --> 02:46:21,440
That’s the whole bottom of Christianity, and that’s what our
missionary will never know.”

1871
02:46:21,440 --> 02:46:25,280
There was a somewhat heavy knock at the office door, and I think
we all feared it was Dr. MacBride.

1872
02:46:25,280 --> 02:46:29,920
But when the Judge opened, the Virginian was standing there in
the darkness.

1873
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:30,360
“So!”

1874
02:46:30,360 --> 02:46:31,800
The Judge opened the door wide.

1875
02:46:31,800 --> 02:46:33,760
He was very hearty to the man he had trusted.

1876
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:35,960
“You’re back at last.”

1877
02:46:35,960 --> 02:46:37,600
“I came to repawt.”

1878
02:46:37,600 --> 02:46:40,400
While they shook hands, Ogden nudged me.

1879
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:41,600
“That the fellow?”

1880
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:42,240
I nodded.

1881
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:45,600
“Fellow who kicked the cook off the train?”

1882
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:49,040
I again nodded, and he looked at the Virginian, his eye and his
stature.

1883
02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:54,680
Judge Henry, properly democratic, now introduced him to Ogden.


1884
02:46:54,680 --> 02:46:57,560
The New Yorker also meant to be properly democratic.

1885
02:46:57,560 --> 02:47:02,400
“You’re the man I’ve been hearing such a lot about.”

1886
02:47:02,400 --> 02:47:04,080
But familiarity is not equality.

1887
02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:09,120
“Then I expect yu’ have the advantage of me, seh,” said the Virginian,
very politely.

1888
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:11,320
“Shall I repawt tomorro’?”

1889
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:13,560
His grave eyes were on the Judge again.

1890
02:47:13,560 --> 02:47:21,400
Of me he had taken no notice; he had come as an employee to see
his employer.

1891
02:47:21,400 --> 02:47:36,520
“Yes, yes; I’ll want to hear about the cattle tomorrow. But step inside a moment
now. There’s a matter⁠—” The Virginian stepped inside, and took off his hat.

1892
02:47:36,520 --> 02:47:41,080
“Sit down. You had trouble⁠—I’ve heard something about it,” the
Judge went on.

1893
02:47:41,080 --> 02:47:45,400
The Virginian sat down, grave and graceful.

1894
02:47:45,400 --> 02:47:48,040
But he held the brim of his hat all the while.

1895
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:53,440
He looked at Ogden and me, and then back at his employer.

1896
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:56,440
There was reluctance in his eye.

1897
02:47:56,440 --> 02:48:10,960
I wondered if his employer could be going to make him tell his own exploits in the presence of us
outsiders; and there came into my memory the Bengal tiger at a trained-animal show I had once seen.

1898
02:48:10,960 --> 02:48:13,240
“You had some trouble,” repeated the Judge.

1899
02:48:13,240 --> 02:48:18,400
“Well, there was a time when they maybe wanted to have notions.
They’re good boys.”

1900
02:48:18,400 --> 02:48:19,960
And he smiled a very little.

1901
02:48:19,960 --> 02:48:22,120
Contentment increased in the Judge’s face.

1902
02:48:22,120 --> 02:48:25,160
“Trampas a good boy too?”

1903
02:48:25,160 --> 02:48:28,320
But this time the Bengal tiger did not smile.

1904
02:48:28,320 --> 02:48:30,840
He sat with his eye fastened on his employer.

1905
02:48:30,840 --> 02:48:33,320
The Judge passed rather quickly on to his next point.

1906
02:48:33,320 --> 02:48:37,440
“You’ve brought them all back, though, I understand, safe and
sound, without a scratch?”

1907
02:48:37,440 --> 02:48:40,520
The Virginian looked down at his hat, then up again at the Judge,
mildly.

1908
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:42,680
“I had to part with my cook.”

1909
02:48:42,680 --> 02:48:45,320
There was no use; Ogden and myself exploded.

1910
02:48:45,320 --> 02:48:47,920
Even upon the embarrassed Virginian a large grin slowly forced
itself.

1911
02:48:47,920 --> 02:48:49,960
“I guess yu’ know about it,” he murmured.

1912
02:48:49,960 --> 02:48:51,760
And he looked at me with a sort of reproach.

1913
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:55,840
He knew it was I who had told tales out of school.

1914
02:48:55,840 --> 02:49:00,280
“I only want to say,” said Ogden, conciliatingly, “that I know
I couldn’t have handled those men.”

1915
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:01,960
The Virginian relented.

1916
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:04,360
“Yu’ never tried, seh.”

1917
02:49:04,360 --> 02:49:09,200
The Judge had remained serious; but he showed himself plainly
more and more contented.

1918
02:49:09,200 --> 02:49:11,640
“Quite right,” he said.

1919
02:49:11,640 --> 02:49:13,360
“You had to part with your cook.

1920
02:49:13,360 --> 02:49:17,040
When I put a man in charge, I put him in charge.

1921
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:19,080
I don’t make particulars my business.

1922
02:49:19,080 --> 02:49:20,400
They’re to be always his.

1923
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:22,320
Do you understand?”

1924
02:49:22,320 --> 02:49:23,400
“Thank yu’.”

1925
02:49:23,400 --> 02:49:29,200
The Virginian understood that his employer was praising his management
of the expedition.

1926
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:55,680
But I don’t think he at all discerned⁠—as I did presently⁠—that his employer had just been putting him to a further test, had laid
before him the temptation of complaining of a fellow-workman and blowing his own trumpet, and was delighted with his reticence.

1927
02:49:55,680 --> 02:49:57,440
He made a movement to rise.

1928
02:49:57,440 --> 02:49:59,560
“I haven’t finished,” said the Judge.

1929
02:49:59,560 --> 02:50:01,920
“I was coming to the matter.

1930
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:07,960
There’s one particular⁠—since I do happen to have been told.

1931
02:50:07,960 --> 02:50:11,520
I fancy Trampas has learned something he didn’t expect.”

1932
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:15,200
This time the Virginian evidently did not understand, any more
than I did.

1933
02:50:15,200 --> 02:50:20,000
One hand played with his hat, mechanically turning it round.

1934
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:20,960
The Judge explained.

1935
02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:24,120
“I mean about Roberts.”

1936
02:50:24,120 --> 02:50:30,160
A pulse of triumph shot over the Southerner’s face, turning it
savage for that fleeting instant.

1937
02:50:30,160 --> 02:50:34,960
He understood now, and was unable to suppress this much answer.


1938
02:50:34,960 --> 02:50:36,400
But he was silent.

1939
02:50:36,400 --> 02:50:43,840
“You see,” the Judge explained to me, “I was obliged to let Roberts,
my old foreman, go last week.

1940
02:50:43,840 --> 02:50:50,760
His wife could not have stood another winter here, and a good
position was offered to him near Los Angeles.”

1941
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:51,080
I did see.

1942
02:50:51,080 --> 02:50:52,080
I saw a number of things.

1943
02:50:52,080 --> 02:50:56,520
I saw why the foreman’s house had been empty to receive Dr. MacBride
and me.

1944
02:50:56,520 --> 02:50:59,840
And I saw that the Judge had been very clever indeed.

1945
02:50:59,840 --> 02:51:10,400
For I had abstained from telling any tales about the present
feeling between Trampas and the Virginian; but he had divined it.

1946
02:51:10,400 --> 02:51:25,880
Well enough for him to say that “particulars” were something he let
alone; he evidently kept a deep eye on the undercurrents at his ranch.

1947
02:51:25,880 --> 02:51:31,200
He knew that in Roberts, Trampas had lost a powerful friend.

1948
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:38,360
And this was what I most saw, this final fact, that Trampas had
no longer any intervening shield.

1949
02:51:38,360 --> 02:51:41,000
He and the Virginian stood indeed man to man.

1950
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:49,360
“And so,” the Judge continued speaking to me, “here I am at a
very inconvenient time without a foreman.

1951
02:51:49,360 --> 02:51:58,600
Unless,” I caught the twinkle in his eyes before he turned to the
Virginian, “unless you’re willing to take the position yourself.

1952
02:51:58,600 --> 02:52:00,480
Will you?”

1953
02:52:00,480 --> 02:52:05,880
I saw the Southerner’s hand grip his hat as he was turning it
round.

1954
02:52:05,880 --> 02:52:11,880
He held it still now, and his other hand found it and gradually
crumpled the soft crown in.

1955
02:52:11,880 --> 02:52:25,680
It meant everything to him: recognition, higher station, better fortune, a
separate house of his own, and⁠—perhaps⁠—one step nearer to the woman he wanted.

1956
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:36,760
I don’t know what words he might have said to the Judge had they been alone, but the
Judge had chosen to do it in our presence, the whole thing from beginning to end.

1957
02:52:36,760 --> 02:52:43,000
The Virginian sat with the damp coming out on his forehead, and
his eyes dropped from his employer’s.

1958
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:47,920
“Thank yu’,” was what he managed at last to say.

1959
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:54,120
“Well, now, I’m greatly relieved!” exclaimed the Judge, rising
at once.

1960
02:52:54,120 --> 02:52:56,960
He spoke with haste, and lightly.

1961
02:52:56,960 --> 02:53:05,840
“That’s excellent. I was in some thing of a hole,” he said to
Ogden and me; “and this gives me one thing less to think of.

1962
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:14,080
Saves me a lot of particulars,” he jocosely added to the Virginian,
who was now also standing up.

1963
02:53:14,080 --> 02:53:22,200
“Begin right off. Leave the bunk house. The gentlemen won’t mind
your sleeping in your own house.”

1964
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:25,760
Thus he dismissed his new foreman gayly.

1965
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:34,000
But the new foreman, when he got outside, turned back for one
gruff word⁠—“I’ll try to please yu’.”

1966
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:34,280
That was all.

1967
02:53:34,280 --> 02:53:35,680
He was gone in the darkness.

1968
02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:45,440
But there was light enough for me, looking after him, to see him lay his
hand on a shoulder-high gate and vault it as if he had been the wind.

1969
02:53:45,440 --> 02:53:49,760
Sounds of cheering came to us a few moments later from the bunk
house.

1970
02:53:49,760 --> 02:53:55,840
Evidently he had “begun right away,” as the Judge had directed.


1971
02:53:55,840 --> 02:54:01,440
He had told his fortune to his brother cowpunchers, and this
was their answer.

1972
02:54:01,440 --> 02:54:06,000
“I wonder if Trampas is shouting too?” inquired Ogden.

1973
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:07,840
“Hm!” said the Judge.

1974
02:54:07,840 --> 02:54:13,280
“That is one of the particulars I wash my hands of.”

1975
02:54:13,280 --> 02:54:14,640
I knew that he entirely meant it.

1976
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:26,480
I knew, once his decision taken of appointing the Virginian his lieutenant for good and all, that,
like a wise commander-in-chief, he would trust his lieutenant to take care of his own business.

1977
02:54:26,480 --> 02:54:31,920
“Well,” Ogden pursued with interest, “haven’t you landed Trampas
plump at his mercy?”

1978
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:33,480
The phrase tickled the Judge.

1979
02:54:33,480 --> 02:54:37,000
“That is where I’ve landed him!” he declared.

1980
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,880
“And here is Dr. MacBride.”

1981
02:54:39,880 --> 02:54:41,120
CHAPTER XXI

1982
02:54:41,120 --> 02:54:43,280
In a State of Sin

1983
02:54:43,280 --> 02:54:47,360
Thunder sat imminent upon the missionary’s brow.

1984
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:49,360
Many were to be at his mercy soon.

1985
02:54:49,360 --> 02:54:51,480
But for us he had sunshine still.

1986
02:54:51,480 --> 02:54:55,560
“I am truly sorry to be turning you upside down,” he said importantly.


1987
02:54:55,560 --> 02:54:59,920
“But it seems the best place for my service.”

1988
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:07,680
He spoke of the tables pushed back and the chairs gathered in the
hall, where the storm would presently break upon the congregation.

1989
02:55:07,680 --> 02:55:10,840
“Eight-thirty?” he inquired.

1990
02:55:10,840 --> 02:55:18,240
This was the hour appointed, and it was only twenty minutes off.


1991
02:55:18,240 --> 02:55:27,600
We threw the unsmoked fractions of our cigars away, and returned
to offer our services to the ladies.

1992
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:29,000
This amused the ladies.

1993
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,040
They had done without us.

1994
02:55:31,040 --> 02:55:33,560
All was ready in the hall.

1995
02:55:33,560 --> 02:55:41,080
“We got the cook to help us,” Mrs. Ogden told me, “so as not
to disturb your cigars.

1996
02:55:41,080 --> 02:55:46,320
In spite of the cowboys, I still recognize my own country.”

1997
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:48,880
“In the cook?” I rather densely asked.

1998
02:55:48,880 --> 02:55:53,880
“Oh, no! I don’t have a Chinaman. It’s in the length of after-dinner
cigars.”

1999
02:55:53,880 --> 02:55:58,800
“Had you been smoking,” I returned, “you would have found them
short this evening.”

2000
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:04,800
“You make it worse,” said the lady; “we have had nothing but
Dr. MacBride.”

2001
02:56:04,800 --> 02:56:07,440
“We’ll share him with you now,” I exclaimed.

2002
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:11,520
“Has he announced his text? I’ve got one for him,” said Molly
Wood, joining us.

2003
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:15,840
She stood on tiptoe and spoke it comically in our ears.

2004
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:18,280
“ ‘I said in my haste, All men are liars.’ ”

2005
02:56:18,280 --> 02:56:21,000
This made us merry as we stood among the chairs in the congested
hall.

2006
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:24,280
I left the ladies, and sought the bunk house.

2007
02:56:24,280 --> 02:56:31,520
I had heard the cheers, but I was curious also to see the men,
and how they were taking it.

2008
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:33,720
There was but little for the eye.

2009
02:56:33,720 --> 02:56:35,560
There was much noise in the room.

2010
02:56:35,560 --> 02:56:48,720
They were getting ready to come to church⁠—brushing their hair, shaving, and making
themselves clean, amid talk occasionally profane and continuously diverting.

2011
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:52,280
“Well, I’m a Christian, anyway,” one declared.

2012
02:56:52,280 --> 02:56:56,040
“I’m a Mormon, I guess,” said another.

2013
02:56:56,040 --> 02:56:59,600
“I belong to the Knights of Pythias,” said a third.

2014
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:09,840
“I’m a Mohammedist,” said a fourth; “I hope I ain’t goin’ to
hear nothin’ to shock me.”

2015
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:12,480
And they went on with their joking.

2016
02:57:12,480 --> 02:57:16,440
But Trampas was out of the joking.

2017
02:57:16,440 --> 02:57:22,680
He lay on his bed reading a newspaper, and took no pains to look
pleasant.

2018
02:57:22,680 --> 02:57:26,200
My eyes were considering him when the blithe Scipio came in.

2019
02:57:26,200 --> 02:57:30,040
“Don’t look so bashful,” said he.

2020
02:57:30,040 --> 02:57:32,800
“There’s only us girls here.”

2021
02:57:32,800 --> 02:57:39,040
He had been helping the Virginian move his belongings from the
bunk house over to the foreman’s cabin.

2022
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:44,360
He himself was to occupy the Virginian’s old bed here.

2023
02:57:44,360 --> 02:57:51,920
“And I hope sleepin’ in it will bring me some of his luck,” said
Scipio.

2024
02:57:51,920 --> 02:58:05,080
“Yu’d ought to’ve seen us when he told us in his quiet way. Well,” Scipio
sighed a little, “it must feel good to have your friends glad about you.”

2025
02:58:05,080 --> 02:58:07,640
“Especially Trampas,” said I.

2026
02:58:07,640 --> 02:58:10,040
“The Judge knows about that,” I added.

2027
02:58:10,040 --> 02:58:13,440
“Knows, does he? What’s he say?”

2028
02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:16,600
Scipio drew me quickly out of the bunk house.

2029
02:58:16,600 --> 02:58:19,360
“Says it’s no business of his.”

2030
02:58:19,360 --> 02:58:21,640
“Said nothing but that?”

2031
02:58:21,640 --> 02:58:24,600
Scipio’s curiosity seemed strangely intense.

2032
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:28,560
“Made no suggestion? Not a thing?”

2033
02:58:28,560 --> 02:58:34,600
“Not a thing. Said he didn’t want to know and didn’t care.”

2034
02:58:34,600 --> 02:58:37,520
“How did he happen to hear about it?” snapped Scipio.

2035
02:58:37,520 --> 02:58:40,240
“You told him!” he immediately guessed.

2036
02:58:40,240 --> 02:58:40,920
“He never would.”

2037
02:58:40,920 --> 02:58:48,720
And Scipio jerked his thumb at the Virginian, who appeared for a
moment in the lighted window of the new quarters he was arranging.

2038
02:58:48,720 --> 02:58:52,680
“He never would tell,” Scipio repeated.

2039
02:58:52,680 --> 02:59:03,640
“And so the Judge never made a suggestion to him,” he muttered,
nodding in the darkness.

2040
02:59:03,640 --> 02:59:04,960
“So it’s just his own notion.

2041
02:59:04,960 --> 02:59:08,680
Just like him, too, come to think of it.

2042
02:59:08,680 --> 02:59:15,520
Only I didn’t expect⁠—well, I guess he could surprise me any
day he tried.”

2043
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:18,200
“You’re surprising me now,” I said.

2044
02:59:18,200 --> 02:59:19,840
“What’s it all about?”

2045
02:59:19,840 --> 02:59:21,360
“Oh, him and Trampas.”

2046
02:59:21,360 --> 02:59:24,600
“What? Nothing surely happened yet?”

2047
02:59:24,600 --> 02:59:27,040
I was as curious as Scipio had been.

2048
02:59:27,040 --> 02:59:30,880
“No, not yet. But there will.”

2049
02:59:30,880 --> 02:59:34,720
“Great Heavens, man! when?”

2050
02:59:34,720 --> 02:59:40,080
“Just as soon as Trampas makes the first move,” Scipio replied
easily.

2051
02:59:40,080 --> 02:59:42,800
I became dignified.

2052
02:59:42,800 --> 02:59:47,040
Scipio had evidently been told things by the Virginian.

2053
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:51,840
“Yes, I up and asked him plumb out,” Scipio answered.

2054
02:59:51,840 --> 02:59:59,880
“I was liftin’ his trunk in at the door, and I couldn’t stand
it no longer, and I asked him plumb out.

2055
02:59:59,880 --> 03:00:03,440
‘Yu’ve sure got Trampas where yu’ want him.’

2056
03:00:03,440 --> 03:00:05,160
That’s what I said.

2057
03:00:05,160 --> 03:00:08,400
And he up and answered and told me.

2058
03:00:08,400 --> 03:00:11,000
So I know.”

2059
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:15,800
At this point Scipio stopped; I was not to know.

2060
03:00:15,800 --> 03:00:20,320
“I had no idea,” I said, “that your system held so much meanness.”


2061
03:00:20,320 --> 03:00:22,560
“Oh, it ain’t meanness!”

2062
03:00:22,560 --> 03:00:23,720
And he laughed ecstatically.

2063
03:00:23,720 --> 03:00:25,480
“What do you call it, then?”

2064
03:00:25,480 --> 03:00:27,600
“He’d call it discretion,” said Scipio.

2065
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:29,840
Then he became serious.

2066
03:00:29,840 --> 03:00:33,400
“It’s too blamed grand to tell yu’.

2067
03:00:33,400 --> 03:00:35,400
I’ll leave yu’ to see it happen.

2068
03:00:35,400 --> 03:00:37,640
Keep around, that’s all.

2069
03:00:37,640 --> 03:00:38,680
Keep around.

2070
03:00:38,680 --> 03:00:42,280
I pretty near wish I didn’t know it myself.”

2071
03:00:42,280 --> 03:00:54,320
What with my feelings at Scipio’s discretion, and my human
curiosity, I was not in that mood which best profits from a sermon.

2072
03:00:54,320 --> 03:01:04,040
Yet even though my expectations had been cruelly left quivering in
mid air, I was not sure how much I really wanted to “keep around.”

2073
03:01:04,040 --> 03:01:16,760
You will therefore understand how Dr. MacBride was able to make a prayer and
to read Scripture without my being conscious of a word that he had uttered.

2074
03:01:16,760 --> 03:01:35,840
It was when I saw him opening the manuscript of his sermon that I suddenly remembered I was
sitting, so to speak, in church, and began once more to think of the preacher and his congregation.

2075
03:01:35,840 --> 03:01:43,360
Our chairs were in the front line, of course; but, being next
the wall, I could easily see the cowboys behind me.

2076
03:01:43,360 --> 03:01:44,920
They were perfectly decorous.

2077
03:01:44,920 --> 03:01:55,320
If Mrs. Ogden had looked for pistols, daredevil attitudes, and
so forth, she must have been greatly disappointed.

2078
03:01:55,320 --> 03:02:05,680
Except for their weather-beaten cheeks and eyes, they were simply American young men
with mustaches and without, and might have been sitting, say, in Danbury, Connecticut.

2079
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:08,520
Even Trampas merged quietly with the general placidity.

2080
03:02:08,520 --> 03:02:23,080
The Virginian did not, to be sure, look like Danbury, and his frame and his features
showed out of the mass; but his eyes were upon Dr. MacBride with a creamlike propriety.

2081
03:02:23,080 --> 03:02:27,360
Our missionary did not choose Miss Wood’s text.

2082
03:02:27,360 --> 03:02:34,280
He made his selection from another of the Psalms; and when it came, I did not
dare to look at anybody; I was much nearer unseemly conduct than the cowboys.

2083
03:02:34,280 --> 03:02:45,480
Dr. MacBride gave us his text sonorously, “ ‘They are altogether
become filthy; There is none of them that doeth good, no, not one.’ ”

2084
03:02:45,480 --> 03:02:50,640
His eye showed us plainly that present company was not excepted
from this.

2085
03:02:50,640 --> 03:02:57,320
He repeated the text once more, then, launching upon his discourse,
gave none of us a ray of hope.

2086
03:02:57,320 --> 03:03:14,640
I had heard it all often before; but preached to cowboys it took on a new glare of untimeliness, of grotesque obsoleteness⁠—as
if someone should say, “Let me persuade you to admire woman,” and forthwith hold out her bleached bones to you.

2087
03:03:14,640 --> 03:03:24,160
The cowboys were told that not only they could do no good, but
that if they did contrive to, it would not help them.

2088
03:03:24,160 --> 03:03:38,040
Nay, more: not only honest deeds availed them nothing, but even if they accepted this especial
creed which was being explained to them as necessary for salvation, still it might not save them.

2089
03:03:38,040 --> 03:03:46,440
Their sin was indeed the cause of their damnation, yet, keeping
from sin, they might nevertheless be lost.

2090
03:03:46,440 --> 03:03:54,640
It had all been settled for them not only before they were born,
but before Adam was shaped.

2091
03:03:54,640 --> 03:04:02,640
Having told them this, he invited them to glorify the Creator
of the scheme.

2092
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:11,760
Even if damned, they must praise the person who had made them
expressly for damnation.

2093
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:14,800
That is what I heard him prove by logic to these cowboys.

2094
03:04:14,800 --> 03:04:21,080
Stone upon stone he built the black cellar of his theology,
leaving out its beautiful park and the sunshine of its garden.

2095
03:04:21,080 --> 03:04:38,520
He did not tell them the splendor of its past, the noble fortress for good
that it had been, how its tonic had strengthened generations of their fathers.

2096
03:04:38,520 --> 03:04:42,600
No; wrath he spoke of, and never once of love.

2097
03:04:42,600 --> 03:04:51,920
It was the bishop’s way, I knew well, to hold cowboys by homely
talk of their special hardships and temptations.

2098
03:04:51,920 --> 03:04:59,360
And when they fell he spoke to them of forgiveness and brought
them encouragement.

2099
03:04:59,360 --> 03:05:07,760
But Dr. MacBride never thought once of the lives of these waifs.


2100
03:05:07,760 --> 03:05:17,560
Like himself, like all mankind, they were invisible dots in creation; like him,
they were to feel as nothing, to be swept up in the potent heat of his faith.

2101
03:05:17,560 --> 03:05:26,240
So he thrust out to them none of the sweet but all the bitter
of his creed, naked and stern as iron.

2102
03:05:26,240 --> 03:05:31,360
Dogma was his all in all, and poor humanity was nothing but flesh
for its canons.

2103
03:05:31,360 --> 03:05:37,160
Thus to kill what chance he had for being of use seemed to me
more deplorable than it did evidently to them.

2104
03:05:37,160 --> 03:05:39,200
Their attention merely wandered.

2105
03:05:39,200 --> 03:05:46,200
Three hundred years ago they would have been frightened; but
not in this electric day.

2106
03:05:46,200 --> 03:05:51,280
I saw Scipio stifling a smile when it came to the doctrine of
original sin.

2107
03:05:51,280 --> 03:06:05,440
“We know of its truth,” said Dr. MacBride, “from the severe troubles and distresses to which
infants are liable, and from death passing upon them before they are capable of sinning.”

2108
03:06:05,440 --> 03:06:13,720
Yet I knew he was a good man; and I also knew that if a missionary
is to be tactless, he might almost as well be bad.

2109
03:06:13,720 --> 03:06:18,640
I said their attention wandered, but I forgot the Virginian.

2110
03:06:18,640 --> 03:06:23,080
At first his attitude might have been mere propriety.

2111
03:06:23,080 --> 03:06:28,800
One can look respectfully at a preacher and be internally breaking
all the commandments.

2112
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:32,480
But even with the text I saw real attention light in the Virginian’s
eye.

2113
03:06:32,480 --> 03:06:41,840
And keeping track of the concentration that grew on him with
each minute made the sermon short for me.

2114
03:06:41,840 --> 03:06:43,360
He missed nothing.

2115
03:06:43,360 --> 03:06:50,000
Before the end his gaze at the preacher had become swerveless.


2116
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,400
Was he convert or critic?

2117
03:06:52,400 --> 03:06:54,320
Convert was incredible.

2118
03:06:54,320 --> 03:06:57,840
Thus was an hour passed before I had thought of time.

2119
03:06:57,840 --> 03:07:02,560
When it was over we took it variously.

2120
03:07:02,560 --> 03:07:08,880
The preacher was genial and spoke of having now broken ground
for the lessons that he hoped to instill.

2121
03:07:08,880 --> 03:07:16,120
He discoursed for a while about trout-fishing and about the
rumored uneasiness of the Indians northward where he was going.

2122
03:07:16,120 --> 03:07:19,200
It was plain that his personal safety never gave him a thought.


2123
03:07:19,200 --> 03:07:21,200
He soon bade us good night.

2124
03:07:21,200 --> 03:07:23,600
The Ogdens shrugged their shoulders and were amused.

2125
03:07:23,600 --> 03:07:25,520
That was their way of taking it.

2126
03:07:25,520 --> 03:07:31,440
Dr. MacBride sat too heavily on the Judge’s shoulders for him
to shrug them.

2127
03:07:31,440 --> 03:07:38,920
As a leading citizen in the Territory he kept open house for
all comers.

2128
03:07:38,920 --> 03:07:43,560
Policy and good nature made him bid welcome a wide variety of
travellers.

2129
03:07:43,560 --> 03:07:53,320
The cowboy out of employment found bed and a meal for himself and his horse,
and missionaries had before now been well received at Sunk Creek Ranch.

2130
03:07:53,320 --> 03:07:58,640
“I suppose I’ll have to take him fishing,” said the Judge, ruefully.


2131
03:07:58,640 --> 03:08:02,720
“Yes, my dear,” said his wife, “you will.

2132
03:08:02,720 --> 03:08:06,120
And I shall have to make his tea for six days.”

2133
03:08:06,120 --> 03:08:14,280
“Otherwise,” Ogden suggested, “it might be reported that you
were enemies of religion.”

2134
03:08:14,280 --> 03:08:16,480
“That’s about it,” said the Judge.

2135
03:08:16,480 --> 03:08:23,080
“I can get on with most people. But elephants depress me.”

2136
03:08:23,080 --> 03:08:28,600
So we named the Doctor “Jumbo,” and I departed to my quarters.


2137
03:08:28,600 --> 03:08:36,400
At the bunk house, the comments were similar but more highly
salted.

2138
03:08:36,400 --> 03:08:39,840
The men were going to bed.

2139
03:08:39,840 --> 03:08:49,600
In spite of their outward decorum at the service, they had not
liked to be told that they were “altogether become filthy.”

2140
03:08:49,600 --> 03:08:52,400
It was easy to call names; they could do that themselves.

2141
03:08:52,400 --> 03:09:12,880
And they appealed to me, several speaking at once, like a concerted piece at the opera: “Say, do you believe babies go to hell?”⁠—“Ah, of course he
don’t.”⁠—“There ain’t no hereafter, anyway.”⁠—“Ain’t there?”⁠—“Who told yu’?”⁠—“Same man as told the preacher we were all a sifted set of sons-of-guns.

2142
03:09:12,880 --> 03:09:14,920
”⁠—“Well, I’m going to stay a Mormon.

2143
03:09:14,920 --> 03:09:20,520
”⁠—“Well, I’m going to quit fleeing from temptation.”⁠—“that

2144
03:09:20,520 --> 03:09:21,960
’s so!

2145
03:09:21,960 --> 03:09:28,760
Better get it in the neck after a good time than a poor one.”


2146
03:09:28,760 --> 03:09:30,840
And so forth.

2147
03:09:30,840 --> 03:09:38,840
Their wit was not extreme, yet I should like Dr. MacBride to
have heard it.

2148
03:09:38,840 --> 03:09:47,280
One fellow put his natural soul pretty well into words, “If I happened to learn
what they had predestinated me to do, I’d do the other thing, just to show ’em!”

2149
03:09:47,280 --> 03:09:47,560
And Trampas?

2150
03:09:47,560 --> 03:09:48,840
And the Virginian?

2151
03:09:48,840 --> 03:09:49,800
They were out of it.

2152
03:09:49,800 --> 03:09:53,440
The Virginian had gone straight to his new abode.

2153
03:09:53,440 --> 03:09:58,640
Trampas lay in his bed, not asleep, and sullen as ever.

2154
03:09:58,640 --> 03:10:02,040
“He ain’t got religion this trip,” said Scipio to me.

2155
03:10:02,040 --> 03:10:05,760
“Did his new foreman get it?” I asked.

2156
03:10:05,760 --> 03:10:11,120
“Huh! It would spoil him. You keep around that’s all. Keep around.”


2157
03:10:11,120 --> 03:10:18,160
Scipio was not to be probed; and I went, still baffled, to my
repose.

2158
03:10:18,160 --> 03:10:23,440
No light burned in the cabin as I approached its door.

2159
03:10:23,440 --> 03:10:33,240
The Virginian’s room was quiet and dark; and that Dr. MacBride
slumbered was plainly audible to me, even before I entered.

2160
03:10:33,240 --> 03:10:35,480
Go fishing with him!

2161
03:10:35,480 --> 03:10:37,720
I thought, as I undressed.

2162
03:10:37,720 --> 03:10:43,360
And I selfishly decided that the Judge might have this privilege
entirely to himself.

2163
03:10:43,360 --> 03:10:47,120
Sleep came to me fairly soon, in spite of the Doctor.

2164
03:10:47,120 --> 03:10:54,840
I was wakened from it by my bed’s being jolted⁠—not a pleasant
thing that night.

2165
03:10:54,840 --> 03:10:55,880
I must have started.

2166
03:10:55,880 --> 03:11:04,720
And it was the quiet voice of the Virginian that told me he was
sorry to have accidentally disturbed me.

2167
03:11:04,720 --> 03:11:06,840
This disturbed me a good deal more.

2168
03:11:06,840 --> 03:11:11,520
But his steps did not go to the bunk house, as my sensational
mind had suggested.

2169
03:11:11,520 --> 03:11:17,040
He was not wearing much, and in the dimness he seemed taller
than common.

2170
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:21,680
I next made out that he was bending over Dr. MacBride.

2171
03:11:21,680 --> 03:11:25,480
The divine at last sprang upright.

2172
03:11:25,480 --> 03:11:27,160
“I am armed,” he said.

2173
03:11:27,160 --> 03:11:29,240
“Take care. Who are you?”

2174
03:11:29,240 --> 03:11:31,480
“You can lay down your gun, seh.

2175
03:11:31,480 --> 03:11:34,240
I feel like my spirit was going to bear witness.

2176
03:11:34,240 --> 03:11:37,080
I feel like I might get an enlightening.”

2177
03:11:37,080 --> 03:11:41,680
He was using some of the missionary’s own language.

2178
03:11:41,680 --> 03:11:49,680
The baffling I had been treated to by Scipio melted to nothing
in this.

2179
03:11:49,680 --> 03:11:55,400
Did living men petrify, I should have changed to mineral between
the sheets.

2180
03:11:55,400 --> 03:12:06,480
The Doctor got out of bed, lighted his lamp, and found a book; and the two retired
into the Virginian’s room, where I could hear the exhortations as I lay amazed.

2181
03:12:06,480 --> 03:12:11,560
In time the Doctor returned, blew out his lamp, and settled himself.


2182
03:12:11,560 --> 03:12:21,520
I had been very much awake, but was nearly gone to sleep again,
when the door creaked and the Virginian stood by the Doctor’s side.

2183
03:12:21,520 --> 03:12:23,600
“Are you awake, seh?”

2184
03:12:23,600 --> 03:12:27,200
“What? What’s that? What is it?”

2185
03:12:27,200 --> 03:12:36,800
“Excuse me, seh. The enemy is winning on me. I’m feeling less
inward opposition to sin.”

2186
03:12:36,800 --> 03:12:42,280
The lamp was lighted, and I listened to some further exhortations.


2187
03:12:42,280 --> 03:12:44,200
They must have taken half an hour.

2188
03:12:44,200 --> 03:12:51,000
When the Doctor was in bed again, I thought that I heard him
sigh.

2189
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:57,680
This upset my composure in the dark; but I lay face downward
in the pillow, and the Doctor was soon again snoring.

2190
03:12:57,680 --> 03:13:00,760
I envied him for a while his faculty of easy sleep.

2191
03:13:00,760 --> 03:13:11,600
But I must have dropped off myself; for it was the lamp in my eyes that
now waked me as he came back for the third time from the Virginian’s room.

2192
03:13:11,600 --> 03:13:17,480
Before blowing the light out he looked at his watch, and thereupon
I inquired the hour of him.

2193
03:13:17,480 --> 03:13:19,560
“Three,” said he.

2194
03:13:19,560 --> 03:13:23,840
I could not sleep any more now, and I lay watching the darkness.


2195
03:13:23,840 --> 03:13:32,080
“I’m afeared to be alone!” said the Virginian’s voice presently
in the next room.

2196
03:13:32,080 --> 03:13:32,960
“I’m afeared.”

2197
03:13:32,960 --> 03:13:45,040
There was a short pause, and then he shouted very loud, “I’m
losin’ my desire afteh the sincere milk of the Word!”

2198
03:13:45,040 --> 03:13:48,200
“What? What’s that? What?”

2199
03:13:48,200 --> 03:13:54,520
The Doctor’s cot gave a great crack as he started up listening,
and I put my face deep in the pillow.

2200
03:13:54,520 --> 03:14:00,000
“I’m afeared! I’m afeared! Sin has quit being bitter in my belly.”


2201
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:01,480
“Courage, my good man.”

2202
03:14:01,480 --> 03:14:08,400
The Doctor was out of bed with his lamp again, and the door shut
behind him.

2203
03:14:08,400 --> 03:14:11,240
Between them they made it long this time.

2204
03:14:11,240 --> 03:14:25,080
I saw the window become gray; then the corners of the furniture grow visible;
and outside, the dry chorus of the blackbirds began to fill the dawn.

2205
03:14:25,080 --> 03:14:32,840
To these the sounds of chickens and impatient hoofs in the stable
were added, and some cow wandered by loudly calling for her calf.

2206
03:14:32,840 --> 03:14:37,800
Next, someone whistling passed near and grew distant.

2207
03:14:37,800 --> 03:14:48,240
But although the cold hue that I lay staring at through the window warmed and
changed, the Doctor continued working hard over his patient in the next room.

2208
03:14:48,240 --> 03:14:57,360
Only a word here and there was distinct; but it was plain from the
Virginian’s fewer remarks that the sin in his belly was alarming him less.

2209
03:14:57,360 --> 03:14:59,080
Yes, they made this time long.

2210
03:14:59,080 --> 03:15:01,800
But it proved, indeed, the last one.

2211
03:15:01,800 --> 03:15:11,480
And though some sort of catastrophe was bound to fall upon us,
it was myself who precipitated the thing that did happen.

2212
03:15:11,480 --> 03:15:13,520
Day was wholly come.

2213
03:15:13,520 --> 03:15:16,960
I looked at my own watch, and it was six.

2214
03:15:16,960 --> 03:15:22,640
I had been about seven hours in my bed, and the Doctor had been
about seven hours out of his.

2215
03:15:22,640 --> 03:15:26,400
The door opened, and he came in with his book and lamp.

2216
03:15:26,400 --> 03:15:33,240
He seemed to be shivering a little, and I saw him cast a longing
eye at his couch.

2217
03:15:33,240 --> 03:15:41,240
But the Virginian followed him even as he blew out the now quite
superfluous light.

2218
03:15:41,240 --> 03:15:56,600
They made a noticeable couple in their underclothes: the Virginian with his lean racehorse shanks
running to a point at his ankle, and the Doctor with his stomach and his fat sedentary calves.

2219
03:15:56,600 --> 03:16:08,160
“You’ll be going to breakfast and the ladies, seh, pretty soon,”
said the Virginian, with a chastened voice.

2220
03:16:08,160 --> 03:16:17,320
“But I’ll worry through the day somehow without yu’. And tonight
you can turn your wolf loose on me again.”

2221
03:16:17,320 --> 03:16:19,200
Once more it was no use.

2222
03:16:19,200 --> 03:16:28,680
My face was deep in the pillow, but I made sounds as of a hen
who has laid an egg.

2223
03:16:28,680 --> 03:16:33,800
It broke on the Doctor with a total instantaneous smash, quite
like an egg.

2224
03:16:33,800 --> 03:16:36,000
He tried to speak calmly.

2225
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:43,880
“This is a disgrace. An infamous disgrace. Never in my life have
I⁠—” Words forsook him, and his face grew redder.

2226
03:16:43,880 --> 03:16:44,760
“Never in my life⁠—”

2227
03:16:44,760 --> 03:16:52,000
He stopped again, because, at the sight of him being dignified
in his red drawers, I was making the noise of a dozen hens.

2228
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:54,560
It was suddenly too much for the Virginian.

2229
03:16:54,560 --> 03:16:59,560
He hastened into his room, and there sank on the floor with his
head in his hands.

2230
03:16:59,560 --> 03:17:06,200
The Doctor immediately slammed the door upon him, and this rendered
me easily fit for a lunatic asylum.

2231
03:17:06,200 --> 03:17:12,520
I cried into my pillow, and wondered if the Doctor would come
and kill me.

2232
03:17:12,520 --> 03:17:15,560
But he took no notice of me whatever.

2233
03:17:15,560 --> 03:17:31,760
I could hear the Virginian’s convulsions through the door, and also the Doctor furiously making his toilet within
three feet of my head; and I lay quite still with my face the other way, for I was really afraid to look at him.

2234
03:17:31,760 --> 03:17:41,760
When I heard him walk to the door in his boots, I ventured to
peep; and there he was, going out with his bag in his hand.

2235
03:17:41,760 --> 03:17:49,960
As I still continued to lie, weak and sore, and with a mind that
had ceased all operation, the Virginian’s door opened.

2236
03:17:49,960 --> 03:17:55,520
He was clean and dressed and decent, but the devil still sported
in his eye.

2237
03:17:55,520 --> 03:17:59,880
I have never seen a creature more irresistibly handsome.

2238
03:17:59,880 --> 03:18:01,840
Then my mind worked again.

2239
03:18:01,840 --> 03:18:03,400
“You’ve gone and done it,” said I.

2240
03:18:03,400 --> 03:18:07,520
“He’s packed his valise. He’ll not sleep here.”

2241
03:18:07,520 --> 03:18:10,480
The Virginian looked quickly out of the door.

2242
03:18:10,480 --> 03:18:14,440
“Why, he’s leavin’ us!” he exclaimed.

2243
03:18:14,440 --> 03:18:19,880
“Drivin’ away right now in his little old buggy!”

2244
03:18:19,880 --> 03:18:24,360
He turned to me, and our eyes met solemnly over this large fact.


2245
03:18:24,360 --> 03:18:33,680
I thought that I perceived the faintest tincture of dismay in
the features of Judge Henry’s new, responsible, trusty foreman.

2246
03:18:33,680 --> 03:18:36,960
This was the first act of his administration.

2247
03:18:36,960 --> 03:18:39,960
Once again he looked out at the departing missionary.

2248
03:18:39,960 --> 03:18:45,440
“Well,” he vindictively stated, “I cert’nly ain’t goin’ to run
afteh him

2249
03:18:45,440 --> 03:18:45,760
.”

2250
03:18:45,760 --> 03:18:46,720
And he looked at me again.

2251
03:18:46,720 --> 03:18:50,520
“Do you suppose the Judge knows?” I inquired.

2252
03:18:50,520 --> 03:18:51,680
He shook his head.

2253
03:18:51,680 --> 03:18:55,800
“The windo’ shades is all down still oveh yondeh.”

2254
03:18:55,800 --> 03:18:57,080
He paused.

2255
03:18:57,080 --> 03:19:02,200
“I don’t care,” he stated, quite as if he had been ten years
old.

2256
03:19:02,200 --> 03:19:02,920
Then he grinned guiltily.

2257
03:19:02,920 --> 03:19:06,920
“I was mighty respectful to him all night.”

2258
03:19:06,920 --> 03:19:16,520
“Oh, yes, respectful! Especially when you invited him to turn
his wolf loose.”

2259
03:19:16,520 --> 03:19:17,720
The Virginian gave a joyous gulp.

2260
03:19:17,720 --> 03:19:21,000
He now came and sat down on the edge of my bed.

2261
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:30,560
“I spoke awful good English to him most of the time,” said he.


2262
03:19:30,560 --> 03:19:36,320
“I can, yu’ know, when I cinch my attention tight on to it.

2263
03:19:36,320 --> 03:19:40,240
Yes, I cert’nly spoke a lot o’ good English.

2264
03:19:40,240 --> 03:19:46,400
I didn’t understand some of it myself!”

2265
03:19:46,400 --> 03:19:51,080
He was now growing frankly pleased with his exploit.

2266
03:19:51,080 --> 03:19:53,240
He had builded so much better than he knew.

2267
03:19:53,240 --> 03:19:58,600
He got up and looked out across the crystal world of light.

2268
03:19:58,600 --> 03:20:00,840
“The Doctor is at one-mile crossing,” he said.

2269
03:20:00,840 --> 03:20:03,040
“He’ll get breakfast at the N-lazy-Y.”

2270
03:20:03,040 --> 03:20:10,760
Then he returned and sat again on my bed, and began to give me
his real heart.

2271
03:20:10,760 --> 03:20:12,480
“I never set up for being better than others.

2272
03:20:12,480 --> 03:20:13,960
Not even to myself.

2273
03:20:13,960 --> 03:20:19,120
My thoughts ain’t apt to travel around making comparisons.

2274
03:20:19,120 --> 03:20:25,320
And I shouldn’t wonder if my memory took as much notice of the
meannesses I have done as of⁠—as of the other actions.

2275
03:20:25,320 --> 03:20:41,600
But to have to sit like a dumb lamb and let a stranger tell yu’ for an hour that yu’re a hawg and a
swine, just after you have acted in a way which them that know the facts would call pretty near white⁠—”

2276
03:20:41,600 --> 03:20:44,840
“Trampas!” I could not help exclaiming.

2277
03:20:44,840 --> 03:20:49,800
For there are moments of insight when a guess amounts to knowledge.


2278
03:20:49,800 --> 03:20:52,160
“Has Scipio told⁠—”

2279
03:20:52,160 --> 03:20:55,320
“No. Not a word. He wouldn’t tell me.”

2280
03:20:55,320 --> 03:21:04,280
“Well, yu’ see, I arrived home hyeh this evenin’ with several
thoughts workin’ and stirrin’ inside me.

2281
03:21:04,280 --> 03:21:08,480
And not one o’ them thoughts was what yu’d call Christian.

2282
03:21:08,480 --> 03:21:11,280
I ain’t the least little bit ashamed of ’em.

2283
03:21:11,280 --> 03:21:12,120
I’m a human.

2284
03:21:12,120 --> 03:21:13,880
But after the Judge⁠—well, yu’ heard him.

2285
03:21:13,880 --> 03:21:20,320
And so when I went away from that talk and saw how positions
was changed⁠—”

2286
03:21:20,320 --> 03:21:22,960
A step outside stopped him short.

2287
03:21:22,960 --> 03:21:30,320
Nothing more could be read in his face, for there was Trampas
himself in the open door.

2288
03:21:30,320 --> 03:21:34,320
“Good morning,” said Trampas, not looking at us.

2289
03:21:34,320 --> 03:21:41,600
He spoke with the same cool sullenness of yesterday.

2290
03:21:41,600 --> 03:21:44,800
We returned his greeting.

2291
03:21:44,800 --> 03:21:49,760
“I believe I’m late in congratulating you on your promotion,”
said he.

2292
03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:52,200
The Virginian consulted his watch.

2293
03:21:52,200 --> 03:21:56,360
“It’s only half afteh six,” he returned.

2294
03:21:56,360 --> 03:21:57,680
Trampas’s sullenness deepened.

2295
03:21:57,680 --> 03:22:02,240
“Any man is to be congratulated on getting a rise, I expect.”


2296
03:22:02,240 --> 03:22:05,520
This time the Virginian let him have it.

2297
03:22:05,520 --> 03:22:11,760
“Cert’nly. And I ain’t forgetting how much I owe mine to you.”


2298
03:22:11,760 --> 03:22:15,080
Trampas would have liked to let himself go.

2299
03:22:15,080 --> 03:22:18,280
“I’ve not come here for any forgiveness,” he sneered.

2300
03:22:18,280 --> 03:22:21,440
“When did yu’ feel yu’ needed any?”

2301
03:22:21,440 --> 03:22:22,760
The Virginian was impregnable.

2302
03:22:22,760 --> 03:22:26,920
Trampas seemed to feel how little he was gaining this way.

2303
03:22:26,920 --> 03:22:28,760
He came out straight now.

2304
03:22:28,760 --> 03:22:31,360
“Oh, I haven’t any Judge behind me, I know.

2305
03:22:31,360 --> 03:22:36,520
I heard you’d be paying the boys this morning, and I’ve come
for my time.”

2306
03:22:36,520 --> 03:22:40,600
“You’re thinking of leaving us?” asked the new foreman.

2307
03:22:40,600 --> 03:22:44,840
“What’s your dissatisfaction?”

2308
03:22:44,840 --> 03:22:52,560
“Oh, I’m not needing anybody back of me. I’ll get along by myself.”


2309
03:22:52,560 --> 03:23:00,720
It was thus he revealed his expectation of being dismissed by
his enemy.

2310
03:23:00,720 --> 03:23:05,880
This would have knocked any meditated generosity out of my heart.


2311
03:23:05,880 --> 03:23:08,440
But I was not the Virginian.

2312
03:23:08,440 --> 03:23:12,800
He shifted his legs, leaned back a little, and laughed.

2313
03:23:12,800 --> 03:23:18,240
“Go back to your job, Trampas, if that’s all your complaint.

2314
03:23:18,240 --> 03:23:20,800
You’re right about me being in luck.

2315
03:23:20,800 --> 03:23:23,960
But maybe there’s two of us in luck.”

2316
03:23:23,960 --> 03:23:30,680
It was this that Scipio had preferred me to see with my own eyes.


2317
03:23:30,680 --> 03:23:34,440
The fight was between man and man no longer.

2318
03:23:34,440 --> 03:23:47,800
The case could not be one of forgiveness; but the Virginian
would not use his official position to crush his subordinate.

2319
03:23:47,800 --> 03:23:59,520
Trampas departed with something muttered that I did not hear, and the Virginian
closed intimate conversation by saying, “You’ll be late for breakfast.”

2320
03:23:59,520 --> 03:24:01,520
With that he also took himself away.

2321
03:24:01,520 --> 03:24:07,960
The ladies were inclined to be scandalized, but not the Judge.


2322
03:24:07,960 --> 03:24:13,760
When my whole story was done, he brought his fist down on the
table, and not lightly this time.

2323
03:24:13,760 --> 03:24:20,160
“I’d make him lieutenant general if the ranch offered that position!”
he declared.

2324
03:24:20,160 --> 03:24:22,360
Miss Molly Wood said nothing at the time.

2325
03:24:22,360 --> 03:24:29,960
But in the afternoon, by her wish, she went fishing, with the
Virginian deputed to escort her.

2326
03:24:29,960 --> 03:24:33,200
I rode with them, for a while.

2327
03:24:33,200 --> 03:24:41,280
I was not going to continue a third in that party; the Virginian was
too becomingly dressed, and I saw Kenilworth peeping out of his pocket

2328
03:24:41,280 --> 03:24:41,280
.

2329
03:24:41,280 --> 03:24:45,680
I meant to be fishing by myself when that volume was returned.


2330
03:24:45,680 --> 03:24:51,200
But Miss Wood talked with skilful openness as we rode.

2331
03:24:51,200 --> 03:24:56,600
“I’ve heard all about you and Dr. MacBride,” she said.

2332
03:24:56,600 --> 03:25:00,640
“How could you do it, when the Judge places such confidence in
you?”

2333
03:25:00,640 --> 03:25:02,080
He looked pleased.
