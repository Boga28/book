CHAPTER ONE
Finding Fossils

2
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:21,360
On a cold winter's day in 1811, a boy and
a girl were walking beside the sea in Lyme

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:31,270
Regis, south-west England. They were alone,
and they walked slowly, looking at the stones

4
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:41,910
under their feet. The sea on their right was
still and grey. On their left, near the land,

5
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,660
there were a lot of large, broken rocks.

6
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,420
The children were looking for something.

7
00:00:51,420 --> 00:01:02,180
The girl, Mary Aiming, was about twelve years
old. Every few minutes, she picked up a stone,

8
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:11,890
looked at it carefully, and put it in her
bag. Then the boy, her older brother Joseph,

9
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:22,411
began to climb over the broken rocks. It was
dangerous; both children knew that. There

10
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:30,630
had been a storm the night before, and some
rocks had fallen into the sea. Another big

11
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,590
rock could fall at any time.

12
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:44,270
But the morning after a storm was also the
best time to look for fossils - the bones

13
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:53,140
of animals or parts of plants that had become
hard and changed into rock.

14
00:01:53,140 --> 00:02:01,360
After a few minutes, Joseph called out to
his sister, 'Mary! Quick! Come and look at

15
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,630
this!'

16
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:12,379
When Mary climbed up to him, he showed her
a line of teeth, half a metre long, in the

17
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:22,049
broken rock. And behind the teeth, there were
some bones, like the head of a strange animal.

18
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:33,549
'It's a crocodile, isn't it?' Joseph said.
'We've found a crocodile in the rocks!'

19
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:39,170
Mary looked carefully at the head of the strange
animal that Joseph had found.

20
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:49,540
'What's that round thing?' she asked. 'Look,
there, behind the teeth.'

21
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:56,950
As she cleaned away some sand from the head,
a bony circle stared back at them.

22
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:07,150
'That must be its eye,' Mary said. 'Look - it's
almost as big as my head!'

23
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:16,310
Her brother laughed. 'And its mouth is as
big as your body. Be careful, Mary. Look at

24
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,499
those teeth! It's going to eat you!'

25
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:31,940
'Don't be silly,' Mary said. 'It's dead. It
died hundreds of years ago. Come on, we've

26
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,349
got to find the rest of its body too.'

27
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:44,310
Some men helped the children to get the bones
of the dead animal out of the rock. It was

28
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:54,519
about four metres long, with flat, bony hands
and a long tail. It had huge eyes and a long

29
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:05,670
mouth full of sharp teeth. At first, people
thought it was a crocodile, but it was not.

30
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:15,569
It was an animal quite different from anything
alive in the world today. In 1818, two scientists

31
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:24,530
called Henry de la Beche and William Conybeare
gave it the name Ichthyosaurus.

32
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:31,680
Mary Arming was wrong about one thing. The
ichthyosaur did not die hundreds of years

33
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:42,780
ago; it died millions of years ago, at a time
which scientists today call the Jurassic period.

34
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:50,961
But Mary Anning was very clever - she knew
how to find the bones of dead animals. All

35
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:59,710
her life, she looked for bones and fossils
near her home in Lyme Regis. She found many

36
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:08,370
more ichthyosaurs, and a different sea animal,
a plesiosaur. The plesiosaur had a round,

37
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:17,599
flat body, four flat hands, and a very long
neck - several metres long - with a very small

38
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,310
head at the end of it.

39
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:30,900
She found a strange flying animal too - a
pterosaur. Pterosaurs had long beaks full

40
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:39,040
of sharp teeth and wings made of skin. Some
of them had wings as big as the wings of a

41
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,879
small plane.

42
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,879
***

43
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:52,361
At this time, in the early 1800s, people were
very interested in bones and fossils. Lots

44
00:05:52,361 --> 00:06:00,130
of people came to Lyme Regis to see the strange
animals that Mary Anning had found. Among

45
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:06,110
them were William Buckland and Gideon Mantell.

46
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:14,099
William Buckland was a clever scientist from
Oxford University. He was very interested

47
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:21,850
in animals, and he liked to watch them and
learn about them. In fact, he kept a lot of

48
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:31,930
animals in his house - not just cats and dogs,
but snakes, insects, a lot of birds, and a

49
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,770
real live bear.

50
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:44,110
Some of Buckland's ideas were very unusual.
He liked to eat animals - but not just the

51
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:51,789
animals that people usually eat, like cows
and sheep. He wanted to taste every bird,

52
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:59,520
fish, insect, and animal in the world. So
every time he found a new type of animal,

53
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,360
he cooked and ate it.

54
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,650
Buckland was also interested in rocks and
fossils, and he rode all over England on his

55
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:18,530
old horse, looking for fossils. He often visited
Mary Aiming in Lyme Regis, and wrote about

56
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:27,599
the ichthyosaurs and pterosaurs. Then one
day, in the village of Stonesfield near Oxford,

57
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:34,490
he discovered some fossil bones and teeth.
The bones were enormous, and the teeth were

58
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:43,190
sharp, like those of a meat-eater. So, in
1824, Buckland wrote about his animal. He

59
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:49,590
called it Megalosaurus - 'big lizard'.

60
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:56,570
Gideon Mantell was also very interested in
Mary's work. He was a doctor who lived in

61
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:05,710
the town of Lewes, in south-east England.
One day, in 1822, his wife met some workmen

62
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:12,979
who were using rocks to mend the road near
her house. They gave her an interesting rock

63
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:20,190
that they had found. She showed it to her
husband when he came home. Dr Mantell was

64
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,190
surprised.

65
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,550
'That's not a rock at all,' he said.

66
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,580
'It's a tooth - a fossilized tooth!'

67
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:35,040
'But look how big it is,' she said. 'What
animal does it come from?'

68
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:45,550
'I don't know,' Dr Mantell said. 'I don't
know of any animal with teeth as big as this.'

69
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,430
Dr Mantell went back to the place where the
workmen had got the rocks, and found some

70
00:08:51,430 --> 00:09:00,529
huge bones there. He decided that the bones
and the tooth came from the same animal. But

71
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:07,990
what was the animal like? For three years
he wondered about this. He talked to his wife

72
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:15,050
and friends, but he did not tell the world
about it. He decided that the tooth was like

73
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:22,970
the tooth of an iguana, a kind of large lizard
up to two metres long. But the bones came

74
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:33,450
from an animal much, much bigger - 18 metres
long. At last, in 1825, Dr Mantell wrote about

75
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:43,220
his animal, and he called it Iguanodon. Later,
he sometimes said that he found the tooth,

76
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,360
and sometimes that his wife did.

77
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:56,911
Seven years later, in 1832, Dr Mantell found
some bones from a very different animal. This

78
00:09:56,911 --> 00:10:06,680
animal, he said, had a very thick skin. He
called it Hylaeosaurus.

79
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
***

80
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,120
Another English scientist, Richard Owen, read
about these strange animals. Owen knew a lot

81
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:23,240
about bones, and he loved to cut up dead animals,
often in his own home. When Owen spent months

82
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:31,671
cutting up a dead rhinoceros, his wife was
very unhappy about the terrible smell! In

83
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:39,820
1842, Owen wrote a book about the animals
that Buckland, Mantell, and other people had

84
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:49,110
found. He called his book Dinosauria and he
was the first person to use the name dinosaur,

85
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:58,570
which means 'terrible lizard'. He said that
Megalosaurus, Iguanodon and Hylaeosaurus came

86
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:09,089
from three different groups of dinosaur, and
scientists still use these three groups today.

87
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:16,649
Owen was not a very nice man, but he was a
great teacher. He wanted everyone to know

88
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:24,650
about the dinosaurs, so he had some models
of dinosaurs made for a park in Crystal Palace,

89
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:31,970
in London. The models were as big as real
dinosaurs, and you can still see them there

90
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:44,010
today. On 1 January 1853, Owen held a dinner
party for twenty-one scientists, inside the

91
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:55,600
model of the iguanodon. But Dr Mantell was
not there. He had died the year before.

92
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,360
Scientists all over the world read Owen's
book. Some of the scientists inside the iguanodon

93
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,990
came from Germany and Belgium. They found
dinosaurs in their countries too. And in the

94
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:19,570
1870s, two Americans, Othniel C. Marsh and
Edward Drinker Cope, began to find dinosaurs

95
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:25,720
in North America - lots and lots of them.

96
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,209
It was an exciting time in the American West,
but it was a difficult, dangerous place to

97
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:39,699
work. There was a lot of fighting everywhere,
and the scientists carried guns to defend

98
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:48,009
themselves. But people were building railways,
and sometimes the railway builders found bones

99
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:57,670
when they were digging through rocks, so it
was just the right place for dinosaur hunters.

100
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:05,110
Marsh and Cope were not friends; in fact,
they hated each other. They hid bones from

101
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:13,970
each other, spied on each other, and sometimes
they stole each other's bones too. They argued

102
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:21,180
with each other in newspapers and books. Each
man tried to find more dinosaur bones than

103
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:28,540
the other. The fight between them, which went
on for about twenty years, was called the

104
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,320
'Bone Wars'.

105
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:39,850
Marsh won the Bone Wars - he discovered eighty
new types of dinosaur, while Cope only discovered

106
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:48,120
fifty-six. But the Bone Wars made dinosaur
hunting very popular, and by the time Marsh

107
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:58,110
and Cope died, everyone knew about dinosaurs.
Since then, scientists have found dinosaurs

108
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:08,880
in South America, Asia, Africa, India, Europe,
and Australia. Some of the most interesting

109
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:16,670
dinosaurs today are the ones that scientists
are finding in China. People have even found

110
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,200
a few dinosaurs in Antarctica.

111
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:34,680
In fact, just like people, dinosaurs lived
all over the world.

112
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:47,230
CHAPTER TWO
Dinosaur Numbers

113
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:54,440
Everything about dinosaurs is extraordinary.
Many of them were big - much, much bigger

114
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:05,519
than humans. The biggest of all, Argentinasaurus,
weighed more than fifteen elephants. The tallest

115
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:14,029
dinosaur, Sauroposeidon, could lift its head
18.5 metres above the ground. That is tall

116
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:21,860
enough to look in through the sixth-floor
window of a modern building. The longest dinosaur,

117
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:33,209
Diplodocus, was 35 metres long - longer than
three buses - and its tail was 21 metres long.

118
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:42,379
The end of that tail could move frighteningly
fast - fast enough to knock a man's head off.

119
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:49,790
Many dinosaurs were very, very dangerous.
Spinosaurus, for example, was much bigger

120
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:59,149
than an elephant. It had a mouth like a crocodile,
but much, much bigger. It had a hundred sharp

121
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:08,180
teeth. An animal like that could probably
kill and eat a human in two or three minutes.

122
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:16,399
Luckily, however, there were no humans alive
at the time of the dinosaurs. That is because

123
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:25,160
the dinosaurs lived an enormously long time
ago. It is really hard to understand how long,

124
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,829
but it is important to try.

125
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:38,139
How long have there been people like us - modern
humans - on Earth? Well, scientists say that

126
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:47,540
we have been here for about 190,000 years.
But before that, there were early humans - people

127
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:55,649
who were almost human, but a little bit different
from us. The oldest early human that scientists

128
00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:01,690
have found died 3.2 million years ago.

129
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:09,470
That is a very long time ago. But it is nothing
to the time that the dinosaurs lived. The

130
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:18,110
last of the big dinosaurs died 65 million
years ago, so all dinosaur bones are at least

131
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:26,320
65 million years old. But many of them are
a lot older, of course, because that is when

132
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,730
dinosaurs ended. When did they begin?

133
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:41,330
The first small dinosaur appeared about 230
million years ago. So dinosaurs lived on Earth

134
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:49,919
for 165 million years. That is more than fifty
times longer than any kind of humans have

135
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,600
lived on Earth.

136
00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:05,480
There were three time periods - the Triassic,
the Jurassic, and the Cretaceous. The first

137
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:13,100
dinosaurs appeared during the Triassic period.
A lot more dinosaurs appeared during the Jurassic

138
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:22,380
period. And even more dinosaurs lived until
the end of the Cretaceous period. Then they

139
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:31,870
all disappeared, very suddenly.

140
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:44,020
CHAPTER THREE
The First Dinosaurs

141
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:52,559
Because the dinosaurs lived for such a long
time, their story is a story of change. Slowly,

142
00:18:52,559 --> 00:19:02,480
over 165 million years, the world changed.
And the dinosaurs changed too.

143
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:10,460
The first dinosaurs were not very big or frightening.
They looked like small chickens. They ran

144
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:17,960
around on two legs, but instead of wings they
had hands with five fingers. They had long

145
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:26,200
tails, small heads, and a mouth with teeth
instead of a bird's beak.

146
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:33,481
In the time before the dinosaurs, there were
lots of different animals. But about 250 million

147
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:42,870
years ago, something terrible happened. Thousands
and thousands of volcanoes exploded. This

148
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:53,080
made the sky very dark, so it was impossible
to see the sun, perhaps for years. Not surprisingly,

149
00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:01,440
95 per cent of all animals and plants died.
Only a few kinds of small animals, which did

150
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,210
not need much food, stayed alive.

151
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:15,080
Some of these small animals were called archosaurs.
The Earth they lived in was a very different

152
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:24,840
place. There were plants, but no grass, no
flowers, and no fruit. And all the continents

153
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:34,340
that we know today - Europe, North America,
South America, Asia, Africa, Antarctica - were

154
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:44,659
quite different. All the land was just one
large continent, called Pangaea. So these

155
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:52,080
little archosaurs could walk from one side
of Pangaea to the other.

156
00:20:52,080 --> 00:21:01,630
In the 1960s, an archosaur called Marasuchus
was found in Argentina. It was very small,

157
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:10,770
just 10 centimetres high. It ran on two legs
and had hands with five fingers. It had a

158
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:18,900
long tail and a mouth with lots of very small
teeth, and it probably ate insects and little

159
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:28,090
animals. But it could run very fast. One of
the important things about dinosaurs was that

160
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:35,789
they had legs under their bodies, like birds.
That helped them to run away from enemies

161
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:43,600
like crocodiles, which have their legs beside
their bodies. It helped them to grow tall

162
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,160
too.

163
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:55,690
Another archosaur was Eoraptor, also found
in Argentina. It was a little bigger than

164
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:04,460
Marasuchus, about 30 centimetres high, like
a small dog, and 1 metre long. It also ran

165
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:13,640
on two legs and ate insects and small animals,
but it only had three fingers on each hand.

166
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,559
It is one of the earliest dinosaurs of all.

167
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:25,279
These little archosaurs were not the only
animals that were alive on Pangaea. There

168
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:32,250
were animals like crocodiles, and there were
also small flying animals, like the pterosaurs

169
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:40,120
that Mary Aiming found. The pterosaurs had
wings made of skin between their fingers.

170
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:46,960
They had long tails and beaks with teeth.
They flew all over Pangaea, and sometimes

171
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,860
they killed the little archosaurs, and ate
them.

172
00:22:52,860 --> 00:23:01,130
All the rest of the world was sea - lots and
lots of it. The sea was full of ichthyosaurs

173
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:07,000
and plesiosaurs. These were in the same family
as the archosaurs, but they had learned to

174
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,010
swim and live in the sea. Some ichthyosaurs
were small, but others were huge, more than

175
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:24,000
15 metres long. They had long mouths full
of teeth, and huge eyes to see in the dark.

176
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,040
As millions and millions of years passed,
all of these animals evolved in different

177
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:39,039
ways. The small two-legged archosaurs, like
Marasuchus and Eoraptor, evolved over time

178
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:46,760
into the first real dinosaurs. Scientists
make a picture, like a family tree, to show

179
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:54,360
this. In the picture, the oldest animals - the
archosaurs - are at the bottom, and the most

180
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,830
recent dinosaurs are at the top.

181
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:07,300
Richard Owen, in 1842, said that there were
three main types of dinosaur: meat-eating

182
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:17,419
dinosaurs, and two types of plant-eating dinosaurs.
Scientists today agree with him. The meat-eating

183
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:26,100
dinosaurs are called theropods. The plant-eating
dinosaurs with long necks and tails are called

184
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:36,230
sauropods, and the ones with extraordinary
thick skins are called ornithiscians.

185
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:44,570
One of the first theropods was Coelophysis.
It ran on two legs, like Marasuchus and Eoraptor.

186
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:54,770
But Coelophysis was much bigger, about 1 metre
high and 2 or 3 metres long. It had three

187
00:24:54,770 --> 00:25:02,270
strong claws on its hands, and a long tail
and long mouth like a crocodile. It could

188
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:09,500
probably stand up on its back legs, as tall
as a man. But it was not heavy, because its

189
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:17,039
bones were full of air, like the bones of
a bird. It was as long as a small car, but

190
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:24,360
it weighed the same as a seven-year-old child.
So it could run very fast, and hunt smaller

191
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,450
animals for food.

192
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:35,539
The first coelophysis was found by an American
scientist called David Baldwin in New Mexico

193
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:44,419
in 1881. Baldwin often spent months looking
for fossils all alone, in the middle of winter,

194
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:50,790
with only his horse beside him. He sent the
bones of the coelophysis to Edward Drinker

195
00:25:50,790 --> 00:26:00,260
Cope during the Bone Wars. Sixty years later,
in 1947, lots more coelophysis were found

196
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:10,160
at a place called Ghost Ranch, in New Mexico.
It is New Mexico's most famous dinosaur.

197
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:19,470
A very early sauropod was Thecodontosaurus,
found near Bristol in England in 1836. It

198
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:27,990
was only the fourth dinosaur ever discovered.
It was not very tall, but up to 2.5 metres

199
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:34,280
long. It probably walked on two legs, and
used its four- clawed hands to help it eat

200
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,230
plants and small insects.

201
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:46,600
A much bigger Triassic sauropod was Plateosaurus.
Plateosaurus was up to 10 metres long and

202
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:55,960
weighed 700 kilograms. It was 3 metres high
when it stood on its back legs. This plant-eating

203
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,659
dinosaur probably walked on two legs and used
the claws on its hands to hold the branches

204
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:13,190
of trees while it ate. The first plateosaur
was found in Bavaria in Germany in 1837. It

205
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:20,250
was the first dinosaur found outside England,
and the fifth dinosaur to be given a name.

206
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:29,570
Since then, fifty more plateosaurs have been
found, in France, Germany, Norway, Switzerland,

207
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,350
and Greenland.

208
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:42,940
An even bigger early sauropod was Riojasaurus,
found in Argentina. It was up to 2.75 metres

209
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:51,149
high, 11 metres long, and weighed up to 3
tonnes. It needed to eat a lot of plants every

210
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:57,980
day in order to stay alive. And by the end
of the Triassic, there were a lot more plants

211
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,580
for these dinosaurs to eat.

212
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:09,019
By the end of the Triassic, the little two-legged
archosaurs had evolved into two main types

213
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:16,890
of dinosaurs: the plant-eating sauropods like
Plateosaurus, and the meat-eating theropods

214
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:24,770
like Coelophysis. The third type of dinosaur,
the ornithiscians, came later.

215
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:33,380
But slowly, over millions of years, the Earth
continued to change. And as the Earth changed,

216
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:49,169
the dinosaurs changed too. They grew bigger,
and stronger - and much, much stranger.

217
00:28:49,169 --> 00:29:01,559
CHAPTER FOUR
Bigger and Stronger

218
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:09,330
As the Triassic period changed into the Jurassic
period, the Earth got warmer. And as the Earth

219
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:18,320
got warmer, the dinosaurs got bigger. There
was more water in the air, and this helped

220
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:26,779
plants to grow. As the plants grew bigger,
there was more food for the animals to eat.

221
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:33,950
So the plant-eating dinosaurs grew bigger
and bigger.

222
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:43,380
The largest Jurassic dinosaurs were the sauropods
- the big plant-eaters. They had very big,

223
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:51,960
heavy bodies with long necks and tails. Because
their bodies were so heavy, they walked on

224
00:29:51,960 --> 00:30:01,880
all four feet. They used their long necks
to eat leaves from tall trees, and they used

225
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:11,390
their long, strong tails to defend themselves.
They had small heads with very small brains

226
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:17,990
- often about 100 grams, or as big as an orange.

227
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:25,640
One of the earliest Jurassic sauropods is
Barapasaurus, which was found in India. It

228
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:34,409
was 18 metres long, and weighed up to 55 tonnes.
But that was only the beginning. In the middle

229
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:42,510
and later Jurassic periods, the sauropod dinosaurs
began to grow very big indeed.

230
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:48,750
By the mid-Jurassic, some sauropods could
reach leaves that were 10 metres from the

231
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:57,980
ground. The bones in these dinosaurs' necks
were hollow in places, so they were not as

232
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:08,330
heavy as other bones. That made it easier
to lift these very long necks.

233
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:16,529
The sauropods' hands still had fingers, which
they could use to hold trees and plants, but

234
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:25,030
they mostly walked on four legs. They could
not run, because they were too heavy. In some

235
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:32,519
ways, they were like elephants - they probably
moved slowly, and they lived in large family

236
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,570
groups or herds.

237
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:46,669
Most big sauropods had at least 100 teeth;
some had 600! But even for an animal with

238
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:57,200
so many teeth, some plants were probably hard
to eat. Scientists have found stones in sauropod

239
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,130
stomachs; they think that the dinosaurs ate
the stones, which then helped to break up

240
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,410
the leaves that they ate.

241
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:15,350
Two of the largest sauropods were Diplodocus
and Apatosaurus. These were found in America

242
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:26,160
in the 1870s by Cope and Marsh. They had small
heads, heavy bodies, and big stomachs. They

243
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:35,000
ate a lot of food, and grew very quickly:
a young apatosaur probably grew 15 kilograms

244
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:43,370
heavier every day! All these animals had very
long, strong tails which they used to defend

245
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:53,210
themselves. Shunosaurus, a dinosaur from China,
actually had sharp bony spikes on the end

246
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:59,120
of its tail, to hit its enemies with.

247
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:10,730
Another big Jurassic dinosaur was Brachiosaurus,
found in the USA and Africa. An adult brachiosaur

248
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:21,320
weighed up to 50 tonnes and was 26 metres
long. Unlike most dinosaurs, its front legs

249
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:29,130
were longer than its back legs. This meant
that it could lift its huge head, on its long

250
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:38,799
neck, about 16 metres above the ground. On
top of its head, between its eyes, Brachiosaurus

251
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:48,970
had a big, hollow nose, full of air. Scientists
think that it used this nose to make loud

252
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:56,429
noises, perhaps to sing to its friends and
frighten its enemies.

253
00:33:56,429 --> 00:34:07,429
Then there was Mamenchisaurus, another enormous
Jurassic dinosaur from China. This huge dinosaur

254
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:17,060
was 25 metres long. Its neck was 12 metres
long - one of the longest necks of any animal

255
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,640
ever discovered.

256
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:28,520
But why were these dinosaurs so big? Well,
one reason is that the world was getting warmer

257
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:36,030
and wetter, so there was more plant food for
them to eat. But there was another important

258
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:45,650
reason - safety. It is easier for big animals
to defend themselves against their enemies.

259
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:54,050
And these big Jurassic sauropods had a lot
of very big, dangerous enemies.

260
00:34:54,050 --> 00:35:03,340
One of their most dangerous enemies was Allosaurus.
Allosaurus was a big theropod - a meat-eating

261
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:13,270
dinosaur. It was about 5 metres high - much
taller than a man - and 12 metres long. It

262
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:21,610
weighed 2 tonnes or more. It ran on two legs
and had three-fingered hands with long, sharp

263
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:30,970
claws. It had small horns over its eyes, and
a mouth full of sharp teeth like kitchen knives.

264
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:38,740
It used these terrible claws and teeth to
kill and eat its food. And its favourite food

265
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:47,090
was big sauropods like Apatosaurus, Diplodocus
and Brachiosaurus.

266
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:55,550
But how did it kill these enormous animals?
Allosaurus was big, but Apatosaurus was much

267
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:04,260
bigger - it was one of the biggest animals
on Earth. It was 20 to 25 metres long and

268
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:13,020
weighed up to 28 tonnes - more than a family
of elephants! And with its long, strong tail,

269
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,900
it could kill a small dinosaur in a second.

270
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:25,920
Sometimes, perhaps, a brave, hungry allosaur
jumped onto the back of an adult apatosaur,

271
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,490
and tried to kill it with its terrible teeth
and claws. But that was very difficult and

272
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:40,610
dangerous, so perhaps they did it a different
way. Some scientists think that allosaurs

273
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:48,060
hunted in family groups. So, perhaps four
or five terrible meat-eaters all jumped onto

274
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:55,750
the back of one apatosaur together. That was
probably easier, and there was plenty of meat

275
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,800
for all of them when they killed it.

276
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:06,290
And like lions today, they probably did not
try to kill the biggest and strongest apatosaur.

277
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:13,400
They looked for an animal that was old, or
ill, and killed that. And sometimes they found

278
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,970
an animal that was already dead.

279
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:27,140
But Allosaurus was a very good killer. Scientists
are sure about that. The dinosaur scientist

280
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:36,540
Thomas Holtz says that dinosaurs like Allosaurus
changed very little over 100 million years.

281
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:42,460
That means, of course, that they were very
successful at what they did. And what they

282
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:51,890
did was hunt, kill, and eat sauropods.

283
00:37:51,890 --> 00:38:01,390
Another terrible Jurassic meat-eater was Ceratosaurus.
This dinosaur was smaller than Allosaurus,

284
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:10,010
but it was still taller than a man. It was
6 to 8 metres long, and heavier than two horses.

285
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:18,690
Ceratosaurus also ran on two legs. It had
long, sharp claws on its four-fingered hands,

286
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:27,580
and a mouth full of very sharp teeth. It had
three small horns on its head and an unusually

287
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:37,740
strong tail. But unlike Allosaurus, it did
not always hunt big sauropods. The scientist

288
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:46,440
Robert Bakker has found lots of Ceratosaurus
teeth near the bones of fish and small crocodiles.

289
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:53,690
He thinks that Ceratosaurus used its big,
strong tail to swim, and hunted for its food

290
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,400
in the water.

291
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,390
During the Jurassic period, the continent
of Pangaea began to break into two continents,

292
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:12,800
Laurasia and Gondwana. The Atlantic Ocean
appeared - at first, it was about fifty kilometres

293
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:20,890
wide. Much of modern Europe was under water
then. So there were lots of fish for Ceratosaurus

294
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:29,160
to eat in Jurassic seas, lakes and rivers.
But there were lots of other animals there

295
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,500
too.

296
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:37,750
In the Jurassic seas, the ichthyosaurs grew
even bigger and stronger. They were hunters,

297
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:45,410
with enormous eyes and long mouths full of
sharp teeth - and they could swim very, very

298
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:52,990
fast, probably at 30 to 50 kilometres per
hour.

299
00:39:52,990 --> 00:40:01,080
There were plesiosaurs in the sea too. Plesiosaurs
did not look like fish: they had round, flat

300
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:09,430
bodies, with four huge, flat hands that they
used to push themselves through the water.

301
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:17,990
They had short tails but very long necks,
sometimes over 10 metres long. Some had very

302
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:26,270
small heads, but others had huge heads, 3
metres long, bigger than any other dinosaur

303
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,330
head.

304
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:38,350
In the Jurassic skies, a new type of pterosaur
appeared - the pterodactyl. Pterodactyls had

305
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:46,190
longer necks than Triassic pterosaurs, and
they had bigger brains too. Most of them had

306
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:54,240
long mouths full of sharp teeth, and many
of them ate fish. Most pterodactyls were as

307
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:03,070
big as large birds today, but a few were much,
much bigger. In fact, the largest pterodactyl

308
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:11,530
of all - Quetzalcoatlus - had wings 12 metres
wide: bigger than a small plane.

309
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:17,590
But Quetzalcoatlus lived in the Cretaceous
period, which came after the Jurassic. It

310
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:28,280
was in the Cretaceous that dinosaurs grew
really big.

311
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:37,150
CHAPTER FIVE
Big, Bad, and Dangerous

312
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:47,950
During the Cretaceous period, Pangaea, which
was once a single continent, continued to

313
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:55,941
break into smaller parts. The Earth began
to look more like the world today: several

314
00:41:55,941 --> 00:42:04,500
different continents, with large seas between
them. This meant that, as time passed, different

315
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:12,130
dinosaurs evolved in each continent. The dinosaurs
of China, for example, were different from

316
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,470
those of South America.

317
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:23,410
But in every continent there were large, plant-eating
sauropods. They grew even larger because the

318
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:32,520
Cretaceous world was warmer and wetter than
before, so plants grew bigger and stronger.

319
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:39,910
And for the first time, some plants had fruit
and flowers. So there was a lot more food

320
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:44,510
for the big dinosaurs to eat.

321
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:54,950
The biggest dinosaur of all was probably Argentinosaurus.
This enormous animal was between 33 and 41

322
00:42:54,950 --> 00:43:05,770
metres long, 6 to 7 metres high, and weighed
between 75 and 90 tonnes. That is more than

323
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:14,300
several families of African elephants. To
keep its huge body alive, one argentinosaur

324
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:21,680
probably needed to eat two or three large
trees every day. There were probably thousands

325
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,160
of these enormous animals in South America,
so just think about the number of trees that

326
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,170
were eaten every day!

327
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:41,190
It is hard to understand how any enemy could
kill Argentinosaurus. It was just too big.

328
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:47,950
Most meat-eaters probably just waited for
it to die, and ate it then. But there were

329
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:56,100
plenty of large, meat-eating dinosaurs in
the Cretaceous. Perhaps from time to time

330
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:05,190
some of them did try to kill a baby argentinosaur,
or a sick or old animal. If they tried to

331
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:11,300
kill a healthy adult they probably got hurt
or killed.

332
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,300
***

333
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:23,470
Not all of the terrible killers in the Cretaceous
were big. In 1964, John Ostrom, a scientist

334
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:32,500
from Yale University in America, discovered
Deinonychus. This animal was too small to

335
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:41,880
kill Argentinasaurus, but it was still very
dangerous. It was about 3 metres long, as

336
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:50,060
tall as a man, and probably covered in feathers
like a bird. It had a big brain, and a mouth

337
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:59,750
as long as a man's leg, full of sharp teeth.
Its hands had three fingers with long, sharp

338
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:07,720
claws, and on the second toe of its back feet
there was another big, dangerous claw.

339
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:17,940
Deinonychus weighed about 80 to 100 kilograms,
and it could run very fast. Scientists think

340
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:27,070
that Deinonychus hunted in groups, like lions
today. When they found a large, plant-eating

341
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:36,000
dinosaur, five, ten, or even twenty deinonychus
jumped onto it, all together. They bit it

342
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,650
with their sharp teeth, and cut it with their
terrible sharp claws, until it died. Then

343
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,330
they ate it.

344
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:55,220
Deinonychus was very frightening, but Utahraptor
was even more dangerous. It had terrible teeth

345
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:03,510
and claws like Deinonychus, but it was much
bigger. It was 6 to 7 metres long, taller

346
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:12,530
than the tallest horse, and it weighed up
to 1.1 tonnes. It had a big brain too, so

347
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:20,630
it was probably very clever. And just like
Deinonychus, these dinosaurs hunted together

348
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:29,280
in groups. For plant-eating dinosaurs, this
was like a really bad dream. They could look

349
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:39,700
up, and see not one, but five or ten terrible
killers running towards them, very fast. It

350
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:44,650
was usually the last thing they ever saw.

351
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:54,540
However, Utahraptor was not the biggest killer.
In 1983, an Englishman called William Walker

352
00:46:54,540 --> 00:47:03,520
discovered an enormous fossil in Surrey, near
London. He called it Baryonyx, which means

353
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:12,700
'heavy claw'. This dinosaur was much bigger,
and so a lot slower, than Utahraptor. It weighed

354
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:23,730
up to 5.4 tonnes, it was 13 metres long, and
2.5 metres high. It had strong, sharp claws

355
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:29,530
on its three-fingered hands, and a long mouth
like a crocodile.

356
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:36,240
We know that Baryonyx ate meat, because inside
its stomach scientists found the bones of

357
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:44,430
an iguanodon, and a lot of fish bones too.
Baryonyx probably lived near water, and used

358
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:51,270
its big, sharp claws and its long crocodile
mouth to catch fish, like some North American

359
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:54,650
bears today.

360
00:47:54,650 --> 00:48:01,000
An even bigger meat-eater than Baryonyx was
Spinosaurus, which was found in Africa by

361
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:10,411
Ernst Stromer, a German scientist. Spinosaurus
looked like Baryonyx, but it was much, much

362
00:48:10,411 --> 00:48:18,420
bigger. It had a long crocodile mouth, sharp
claws on three-fingered hands, and a huge

363
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:26,980
sail on its back. It weighed 8 to 13 tonnes,
as much as the biggest African elephant. It

364
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:36,220
was 14 to 18 metres long and 3 metres tall.
A spinosaur head that was discovered recently

365
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:42,960
was 2 metres long - longer than a tall man.

366
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:49,370
All these dinosaurs were terrible. But the
most famous and terrible of all the meat-eating

367
00:48:49,370 --> 00:49:00,430
theropods is Tyrannosaurus rex. This animal
was also enormous. It weighed 6 to 7 tonnes

368
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:10,090
and it was over 4 metres tall - taller than
Spinosaurus. Unlike most dinosaurs, it had

369
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:18,080
very small arms and hands, so it probably
used its mouth to kill and eat things. But

370
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:28,050
this was no ordinary mouth - it had over 50
teeth, some as big as a large banana. And

371
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:36,860
its jaws were extraordinarily strong - much
stronger than the jaws of a lion or a bear.

372
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:44,100
So just how strong were those jaws? What is
there in the modern world that is like them?

373
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:51,270
Recently, scientists measured the 'bite' of
a modern machine which picks up old cars and

374
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:59,080
breaks them into small pieces. Then they measured
the bite of the jaws of a tyrannosaur - and

375
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:07,010
it was 50 per cent stronger than the machine.
So a tyrannosaur could easily bite right through

376
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:14,180
a car - in a world with both tyrannosaurs
and cars, of course!

377
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:21,940
Because they were so big, tyrannosaurs could
probably not run very fast. So some scientists

378
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:29,240
think that they did not hunt like Deinonychus;
they just found dead animals and ate them.

379
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:36,570
But other scientists disagree. They say that
really big sauropods, like Diplodocus and

380
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:43,380
Argentinosaurus, could not run fast either.
And scientists have found damage from tyrannosaur

381
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:50,560
teeth on the bones of two dinosaurs which
escaped. This shows that tyrannosaurs tried

382
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,310
to kill living dinosaurs.

383
00:50:55,310 --> 00:51:02,440
Tyrannosaurus was a North American dinosaur:
in Hell Creek, Montana, scientists have found

384
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:09,900
fossils from more than fifty tyrannosaurs.
But in China and Mongolia, they have discovered

385
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:17,750
fossils of Tarbosaurus, a dinosaur in the
same family as Tyrannosaurus. Tarbosaurus

386
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:25,490
also had small hands, and big jaws full of
sharp teeth. It had a large brain, and it

387
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:32,580
could smell and hear well, which helped it
to hunt. Perhaps it also had feathers around

388
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:36,450
its neck.

389
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:42,820
Velociraptor is a much smaller theropod from
China and Mongolia. The first velociraptor

390
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:52,260
was found in the Gobi Desert in 1922, by an
American called Roy Chapman Andrews. It was

391
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:59,160
a small dinosaur, 2 metres long and about
60 centimetres tall, and it was covered in

392
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:07,890
feathers. Velociraptor did not weigh much
- 15 to 18 kilograms, which is less than a

393
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:17,040
large dog. But unlike a dog, it ran on two
legs, and had hands with three sharp claws.

394
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:23,990
And like Deinonychus, it had another very
long, sharp claw on each foot. Velociraptor

395
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:32,550
probably ran very fast and hunted in groups,
like Deinonychus and Utahraptor. Like them,

396
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:36,320
it was a very frightening killer.

397
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:42,680
But even the most terrible killer can get
things wrong sometimes. In the Gobi Desert

398
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:52,240
in 1971, scientists discovered two extraordinary
fossils. One was a velociraptor, the other

399
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,860
was a plant-eating dinosaur called protoceratops.

400
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:03,730
The two dinosaurs had died when they were
trying to kill each other. The protoceratops

401
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:12,150
had the velociraptor's right arm in its jaws.
It was trying to bite its arm off. The velociraptor

402
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:20,510
had its claws in the head and neck of the
protoceratops. It was trying to cut the protoceratops's

403
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:23,180
neck open.

404
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:31,080
This terrible fight happened beside a hill
of sand. As the two dinosaurs were fighting,

405
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:39,160
the hill fell on top of them. So they both
died. And there they stayed, for millions

406
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:45,950
of years, under the sand, until one day the
scientists found them.

407
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:59,110
But what about Protoceratops? What type of
dinosaur was that?

408
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:11,740
CHAPTER SIX
Strangest of All

409
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:20,010
Protoceratops is one of the third type of
dinosaurs: the ornithiscians. The ornithiscians

410
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:27,750
are the strangest of all dinosaurs. They were
plant eaters, but many of them had horns,

411
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:33,920
and they defended themselves with their very
thick, strong skin.

412
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:41,410
There were very few ornithiscians in the Triassic
period. They began to appear in the Jurassic,

413
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:49,000
and there were lots of them in the Cretaceous.
Protoceratops was a very successful small

414
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:57,590
dinosaur. Its mouth was like a bird's beak
and had a very strong bite. And behind its

415
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:08,080
head, Protoceratops had a large frill of skin.
This frill was probably brightly coloured,

416
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:14,310
and the dinosaur used it to frighten its enemies
and attract females.

417
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:24,610
Triceratops was like Protoceratops, but much
bigger. In fact, Triceratops was huge: it

418
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:35,430
was 8 metres long, and weighed 11 tonnes,
much more than the largest African elephant.

419
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:42,510
Like Protoceratops, it had a mouth like a
bird's beak, and a large frill of skin and

420
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:51,990
bone behind its head. Its head was enormous,
and it had three large horns. Triceratops

421
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:59,580
used these horns to defend itself against
its enemies. We know that this happened because

422
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:05,970
some Triceratops horns have damage from Tyrannosaurus
teeth on them.

423
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:12,880
The ornithiscians had many ways to defend
themselves against enemies like Tyrannosaurus.

424
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:23,010
Huayangosaurus, found in China in 1982, had
lots of sharp spikes all along its back. There

425
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:30,800
were bony spikes on its shoulders too, and
on the end of its tail. Stegosaurus, from

426
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:39,410
North America, was much the same. These dinosaurs
used their strong, bony tails to hit their

427
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:47,270
enemies. Several meat-eaters, like Allosaurus,
have been found with holes in their bones

428
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:53,810
made by the spikes on the tail of a Stegosaurus.

429
00:56:53,810 --> 00:57:00,041
Animals like these from the late Jurassic
have been found in Europe and Africa. All

430
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:05,930
of them were huge, as big as a modern rhinoceros.

431
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:12,720
Ankylosaurus lived in the late Cretaceous.
It had a really thick skin, with spikes all

432
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:20,770
over its back, head and sides. It had a very
strong tail with a heavy club at the end,

433
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:28,410
which was excellent for fighting enemies.
Ankylosaurus was up to 9 metres long, and

434
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:36,510
weighed up to 8 tonnes - much more than an
elephant. So when that tail hit something,

435
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,680
it hurt.

436
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:46,230
Tenontosaurus was another big, plant-eating
animal, but it was not as strong or dangerous

437
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:54,500
as Ankylosaurus. It lived in large herds in
North America; in fact, some scientists call

438
00:57:54,500 --> 00:58:02,350
it 'the cow of the Cretaceous', because there
were so many of them. Tenontosaurus was an

439
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:09,120
everyday food for meat- eating hunters like
Deinonychus.

440
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:15,930
Iguanodon was an ornithiscian too. It lived
in large family groups or herds, like cows

441
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:25,310
or sheep today; in Belgium, the fossils of
forty of them were found in the same place.

442
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:33,180
Iguanodon had a long face like a horse, with
a mouth like a beak for eating plants. It

443
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:42,480
could eat plants well, moving both jaws at
once (we humans only move the bottom jaw).

444
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:49,910
Iguanodon sometimes walked on two legs, and
sometimes on four. Each hand had a sharp spike,

445
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:56,550
like a thumb, which it used to fight its enemies,
and it could also pick things up with the

446
00:58:56,550 --> 00:59:05,620
help of its little finger. It was as big as
a large African elephant.

447
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:14,210
Hadrosaurs were in the same family as Iguanodon,
but they were even stranger. These plant-eating

448
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:22,730
dinosaurs had flat, wide beaks with teeth
inside them - lots of them. In fact, some

449
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:33,590
hadrosaurs had up to 720 teeth (humans only
have 28). New teeth were growing all the time

450
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:38,330
to take the place of any teeth that fell out.

451
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:44,780
Hadrosaurs had long faces like horses too,
and they lived in large herds all over North

452
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:53,360
America. The smallest was as big as a horse,
but many were bigger than elephants. One of

453
00:59:53,360 --> 01:00:01,400
the strangest hadrosaurs was Lambeosaurus.
It was 3 or 4 metres high, and weighed up

454
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:10,300
to 8 tonnes. On its head was a large bone,
like an enormous hat. The 'hat' was as big

455
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,830
as a man.

456
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:21,610
The male Parasaurolophus had an even bigger
'hat' on the back of its head. This 'hat'

457
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:31,390
was really a long, hollow bone, about 1 metre
long, joined to its nose. At first, scientists

458
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:39,900
could not understand this. What was it for?
Then they found a possible explanation. When

459
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:47,100
they blew air through this long, hollow bone,
it made loud musical sounds.

460
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:56,030
Was Parasaurolophus a musical dinosaur? It
is quite possible. The males could make wonderful

461
01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:02,790
sounds with these long, hollow bones on their
heads. Perhaps they did this to attract the

462
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:09,770
females, or to call to their children. They
probably did it when they saw an enemy. And

463
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:17,130
maybe sometimes they did it just for fun,
because they liked singing to each other.

464
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:27,160
But the hadrosaurs were interesting for another
reason - their family life.

465
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:34,950
CHAPTER SEVEN
Family Life

466
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:45,900
In 1923, the American scientist Roy Chapman
Andrews discovered something very strange.

467
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:53,100
In the Gobi Desert, in Mongolia, he found
the bones of a new dinosaur. It was about

468
01:01:53,100 --> 01:02:02,490
2 metres long, with a strong beak, no teeth,
and a thin 'hat' on top of its head. And it

469
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:08,680
was probably covered with feathers, like a
very big chicken.

470
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:16,160
Underneath this dinosaur there was a nest
full of eggs. This was the first time anyone

471
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:23,780
had found dinosaur eggs. At first, Roy Chapman
Andrews thought that the eggs belonged to

472
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:31,740
a different dinosaur, Protoceratops. The new
dinosaur, he thought, was trying to steal

473
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:39,960
them when it died. So he called his new dinosaur
Oviraptor, which means 'egg stealer.'

474
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:49,310
But later, in the 1990s, another oviraptor
was found on a nest of eggs. Scientists looked

475
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:55,430
at these eggs very carefully, and decided
that the eggs did not belong to Protoceratops

476
01:02:55,430 --> 01:03:03,530
after all - they belonged to Oviraptor. The
female oviraptor was sitting on her own eggs

477
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:10,790
when she died. She was keeping them warm with
her body, like a bird.

478
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:18,230
This was a surprise. At this time, nobody
thought that dinosaurs could be good parents.

479
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:23,650
Most scientists thought that dinosaurs just
laid their eggs on the ground, and walked

480
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:30,630
away. But the oviraptor was taking care of
her eggs like a good mother.

481
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:37,610
Most dinosaurs could not do this. They were
much too heavy to sit on their eggs. In Montana,

482
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:44,080
scientists found hundreds of dinosaur nests,
but the eggs in the nests came from a type

483
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:52,250
of hadrosaur that weighed 3 tonnes. Were these
mothers interested in their babies? Probably

484
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:58,210
not, the scientists thought. They probably
just laid their eggs, and forgot all about

485
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,940
them.

486
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:06,440
But there was a problem. They found a lot
of baby dinosaurs in the nests beside the

487
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:13,830
eggs. These baby dinosaurs were very small,
no bigger than a chicken. They could not walk

488
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:20,790
far, because their bones were not strong enough.
But their teeth showed that they had eaten

489
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:29,290
plants. How did the baby dinosaurs find these
plants, when they were too young to walk?

490
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:36,000
The scientists thought hard about this. The
baby dinosaurs did not find the plants, they

491
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,990
decided. That was impossible; they could not
walk. So it must be the parents who found

492
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:50,270
the plants. They brought them to their nests,
for their children to eat. These dinosaurs

493
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:56,990
were looking after their children, like good
parents. So the scientists called this new

494
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:04,330
dinosaur Maiasaura, which means 'good mother
lizard'.

495
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:13,140
Maiasaurs laid twenty or thirty eggs in each
nest. Then they covered the eggs with dead

496
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:21,370
plants, to keep them warm. When the babies
came out of the eggs, they weighed about 1

497
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:30,330
kilogram, but they grew very quickly. Ten
years later, they were adults, weighing 3

498
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:37,360
tonnes. This shows they were warm-blooded,
because cold-blooded animals cannot grow that

499
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,400
fast.

500
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:48,490
When they could walk, baby maiasaurs followed
their parents around, looking for food. Maiasaurs

501
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:57,290
were very successful: in one fossil site,
there are over 10,000 animals. They lived

502
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:06,310
in huge herds, like many animals in Africa
today. And all around them, like lions in

503
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:17,230
Africa, were the hunters - tyrannosaurs, deinonychus,
utahraptors. When the baby maiasaurs saw them,

504
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:22,080
perhaps they ran under their parents' legs,
to stay safe.

505
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:31,560
Tyrannosaurs probably fed their babies too
- but with meat, not plants. As the young

506
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:39,270
tyrannosaurs grew, they probably hunted together
in groups. Young tyrannosaurs had long legs,

507
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:46,090
but they were not heavy, so they could probably
run much faster than their parents. Perhaps

508
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:52,910
the adults and children hunted together, the
young tyrannosaurs chasing an animal towards

509
01:06:52,910 --> 01:07:00,320
their enormous parent. Or perhaps the young
hunted the smaller animals, and their parents

510
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:10,170
hunted the big, slow-moving ones. Tyrannosaurs
did not always kill their food, of course.

511
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:16,080
Sometimes they just found it lying on the
ground. And a dead dinosaur was a free meal

512
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:25,690
for all the tyrannosaur family.

513
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:38,880
CHAPTER EIGHT
Birds

514
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:49,200
In 1861, a small fossil was found in Germany.
It was very small - no bigger than a chicken.

515
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:56,000
Its bones looked like those of Compsognathus,
a small theropod dinosaur which was found

516
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:03,790
in the same place ten years earlier. But this
new fossil's arms and legs were covered with

517
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:10,380
feathers. Scientists called it Archaeopteryx.

518
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:18,540
When the English scientist T. H. Huxley looked
at Archaeopteryx, he noticed something else.

519
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:24,859
Its bones were hollow, just like the bones
of birds. There was a lot of air in them,

520
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:34,470
so they did not weigh very much. Archaeopteryx,
like Compsognathus and most theropods, ran

521
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:43,090
on two legs. And because Archaeopteryx had
feathered wings, it could probably fly. This

522
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:50,310
gave Huxley an idea: perhaps birds evolved
from theropods.

523
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:57,520
For the next hundred years, scientists argued
about this. It is a crazy idea, some people

524
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:03,980
said: how can a dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus
be in the same family as the birds we see

525
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,600
in our gardens?

526
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:16,120
But then, in 1964, the American scientist
John Ostrom discovered Deinonychus in Montana,

527
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:25,220
USA. Deinonychus was a theropod, like Tyrannosaurus,
but its bones were like those of birds. It

528
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:33,230
could move its wrists and arms in the way
a bird does, and its bones were hollow. Tyrannosaurus

529
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:41,089
also had some hollow bones, and so did the
big sauropods like Diplodocus - that is why

530
01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:48,770
its enormously long neck and tail are not
as heavy as they look. So Ostrom decided that

531
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:52,069
Huxley's idea was right.

532
01:09:52,069 --> 01:10:00,940
In 1996, scientists in China made another
extraordinary discovery - a small dinosaur

533
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:11,400
called Sinosauropteryx. It was very like Compsognathus,
but there was an important difference: Sinosauropteryx

534
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:19,440
had feathers all over its body. The sand where
it had died was very fine and soft, so scientists

535
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:27,970
could see that it had had feathers. Sinosauropteryx
was a theropod, like Tyrannosaurus, but it

536
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:31,960
was covered in feathers like a bird.

537
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:39,150
No other animals have feathers - only dinosaurs
and birds.

538
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:46,330
In the next few years, Chinese scientists
discovered many more feathered dinosaurs.

539
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:54,830
The one most like a bird was Microraptor,
which had a long tail, a beak with small teeth,

540
01:10:54,830 --> 01:11:03,130
and claws on its hands and feet. It was smaller
than Archaeopteryx, but it also had long feathers

541
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:10,560
on its arms and legs. So perhaps it flew with
four wings, not two.

542
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:17,840
Other Chinese dinosaurs, like Oviraptor, had
feathers but could not fly. So which came

543
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,800
first - feathers or flying?

544
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:28,880
Today, scientists think that many dinosaurs
had feathers. The feathers kept the dinosaurs

545
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:36,930
warm. They also helped dinosaur mothers, like
Oviraptor, to keep their eggs warm in their

546
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:42,540
nests. So the feathers probably came first.

547
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:49,850
Much later, some small feathered dinosaurs,
like Microraptor and Archaeopteryx, probably

548
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:57,340
learned how to climb into trees. They used
their claws and beaks to help them climb.

549
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:03,500
They slept in the trees at night, safe from
their enemies. In the morning, they came down

550
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:10,310
from the trees. As they came down, they sometimes
opened their wings and jumped. This helped

551
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:13,870
them to fall down more slowly.

552
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:20,580
Over millions of years, they learned to do
this better. Sometimes, when they jumped from

553
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:27,770
trees, they were able to catch small animals
by surprise. Those with the best wings and

554
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:35,130
feathers caught more food, so they lived longer,
and had more children. Some of their children

555
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:44,910
were born with better wings and better feathers.
And one day, they learned to fly.

556
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:52,190
Even dinosaurs which could not fly, like Oviraptor,
were like birds in other ways. They laid eggs

557
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:59,210
in nests, and sat on the eggs to keep them
warm. And dinosaurs like Maiasaura brought

558
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:06,860
food to their babies in the nests, like birds.
Even Tyrannosaurus probably had feathers around

559
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:14,280
its neck, and hollow bones with air in them.
Tyrannosaurus, in fact, was not very different

560
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,810
from an enormous, terrible chicken!

561
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:35,250
Dinosaur scientists are very sure about this.
Thomas Holtz says it clearly: 'Birds are dinosaurs.'

562
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:46,520
CHAPTER NINE
A Sudden End

563
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:55,631
Birds, of course, are still with us. But all
the other dinosaurs disappeared, 65 million

564
01:13:55,631 --> 01:14:03,080
years ago. Why? What happened?

565
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:09,180
Scientists wondered about this for a long
time. Dinosaurs, after all, were very successful

566
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:18,250
animals indeed. They had lived on Earth for
165 million years, and they were the biggest,

567
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:27,020
strongest, and most successful animals of
all time. In the late Jurassic and Cretaceous

568
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:33,580
periods, there were dinosaurs all over the
Earth. They lived on every continent - even

569
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:42,891
in Antarctica, which was much warmer at that
time than it is today. And then, 65 million

570
01:14:42,891 --> 01:14:52,420
years ago, they all disappeared, very suddenly.
There are no dinosaur fossils anywhere on

571
01:14:52,420 --> 01:15:02,980
Earth from after that time. Something terrible
must have happened to them. But what was it?

572
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:11,190
In the 1970s, a scientist called Walter Alvarez
tried to answer this question. He looked at

573
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:17,650
the rocks from the Cretaceous, and the time
after that - the Tertiary. There were hundreds

574
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:25,930
of dinosaur fossils in the Cretaceous, and
none in the Tertiary. But in between the Cretaceous

575
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:34,720
and the Tertiary, he found a thin line of
clay, a kind of soft, wet rock.

576
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:42,500
He found this line of clay all over the world,
and everywhere it was the same. In it, he

577
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:50,500
found a silver-white metal called iridium.
Iridium is very unusual on Earth, but there

578
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:58,190
is a lot of it in meteors - the rocks that
sometimes fall onto the Earth from the sky.

579
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:04,770
So the iridium came from a meteor, Walter
Alvarez said - a meteor that hit the Earth

580
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:09,790
65 million years ago.

581
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:17,690
We know it was a big meteor, Alvarez said,
because there is so much iridium everywhere.

582
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:24,290
He thought that the meteor was a rock between
10 and 15 kilometres across, which hit the

583
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:31,980
Earth with an enormous BANG! It made a crater
- a very big hole in the ground - that was

584
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:41,010
160 kilometres across. A huge ball of fire
destroyed anything near the crater, and the

585
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:52,810
ground shook violently. In the sky, dark clouds
hid the sun for months, perhaps years.

586
01:16:52,810 --> 01:17:00,710
Without sunlight, almost all the plants on
Earth died. The big plant-eating dinosaurs

587
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:08,650
- like Argentinosaurus - soon died, because
they had nothing to eat. The meat-eating dinosaurs,

588
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:14,540
like Tyrannosaurus, lived a little longer,
because there were lots of dead plant-eaters

589
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:23,550
to eat. But then the meat went bad, and there
was nothing left to kill. So they died too.

590
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:32,600
Well, it is an interesting idea, people said,
but where is this crater? A hole in the Earth,

591
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:42,090
160 kilometres across - that cannot be difficult
to find. Why has nobody seen it?

592
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:48,070
Walter Alvarez looked for this big crater,
and with the help of a scientist called Glen

593
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:55,940
Penfield he found it. There was a reason why
nobody had seen it before: it was under the

594
01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:05,100
ground, in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.
In the past 65 million years, the rocks had

595
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:13,130
moved and covered it up, but it was still
there. It measured 180 kilometres from one

596
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:22,850
side to the other, which was even bigger than
he had expected. He called it the Chicxulub

597
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:24,170
crater.

598
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:32,250
So scientists think the Age of the Dinosaurs
ended like this. One day, 65 million years

599
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:41,170
ago, the world was full of dinosaurs. It began
like any other day. Huge herds of dinosaurs

600
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:48,230
were walking slowly across Mexico. Oviraptors
were sitting on their nests, and maiasaurs

601
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:56,610
were finding food for their babies. Small
feathered dinosaurs were flying from trees.

602
01:18:56,610 --> 01:19:02,200
Huge stegosaurs were walking slowly through
the forest, and argentinosaurs were eating

603
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:10,920
the tops of trees. Tyrannosaurs were watching
the plant-eaters carefully, hoping for a meal.

604
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:16,900
And dinosaurs from the parasaurolophus family,
with their strange, hollow heads, were singing

605
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:20,830
to their friends far away.

606
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:26,120
The plant-eaters kept their eyes open, as
they did every day. They were looking for

607
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:33,520
danger - for tyrannosaurs and utahraptors,
the enemies that wanted to kill them.

608
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:41,210
But none of them looked up into the sky, where
the real danger was.

609
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:51,790
Then, suddenly, in a few seconds, it happened.
A bright light filled the sky, and there was

610
01:19:51,790 --> 01:20:00,880
an enormous BANG! - louder than anything they
had ever heard. A great wind knocked all the

611
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:11,170
trees flat, and a few seconds later, everything
in the forest was on fire.

612
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:16,670
All the dinosaurs nearest to the meteor were
burned in a few minutes. There was nothing

613
01:20:16,670 --> 01:20:25,190
left of them, nothing at all. Those more than
50 kilometres away died more slowly. But all

614
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:31,140
of them, all over the world, began to die.

615
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:40,580
In a few seconds, 165 million years had ended.

616
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:50,420
Not everything died, of course. Some small
animals, like insects, snakes, and small birds,

617
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:57,290
lived. Because they were not very big, they
did not need much food. One of these small

618
01:20:57,290 --> 01:21:05,150
animals looked a bit like a mouse. It was
a warm-blooded animal, covered in soft hair,

619
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:13,530
and it probably lived in holes in the ground.
Dinosaurs ate lots of them every day - but

620
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:20,820
now, suddenly, the dinosaurs were gone. So
now this animal could come out of its holes,

621
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,340
and feel a little bit safer.

622
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:34,260
This small, unimportant animal was an early
mammal. Over the next 64.5 million years,

623
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:44,790
it slowly evolved into many different types
of mammals - elephants, lions, bears, horses,

624
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:49,210
sheep, and humans.

625
01:21:49,210 --> 01:22:03,360
And today there are mammals all over the Earth,
just as, once upon a time, there were dinosaurs.

626
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:15,650
CHAPTER TEN
Studying Dinosaurs

627
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:21,960
But how do we know all this? There were no
humans alive when the dinosaurs lived, and

628
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:28,880
we cannot travel back in time to watch them.
So how do we know?

629
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:36,251
We can learn a lot about dinosaurs from fossils.
There are two types of dinosaur fossils: body

630
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:40,320
fossils, and trace fossils.

631
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:46,680
Body fossils are what is left of the real
bones from dinosaur bodies. Over time they

632
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:54,870
have changed and become hard, like rock. Sometimes
scientists are lucky, and find all the bones

633
01:22:54,870 --> 01:23:02,920
of a single dinosaur in one place, but that
is very unusual. Usually, they just find a

634
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:09,550
few bones, and the other parts of the body
have disappeared. This may be because when

635
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:16,021
the dinosaur died, some other animals ate
it, and carried away the bones. Sometimes

636
01:23:16,021 --> 01:23:21,640
water has washed some of the bones away, or
the rocks that contained the fossils have

637
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:24,900
broken into smaller pieces.

638
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:32,800
But even from one fossil, we can learn a lot.
Dr Mantell learned a lot from the single iguanodon

639
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,530
tooth he found in 1822.

640
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:44,611
It was very big, so it came from a very big
animal. It was not a very sharp tooth, so

641
01:23:44,611 --> 01:23:51,720
he knew the animal ate plants, not meat. And
it looked different from the teeth of almost

642
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:59,750
every animal alive today. The only living
animal with teeth like that was the big lizard

643
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:08,040
called an iguana. So Dr Mantell called it
Iguanodon. Later, when he found some more

644
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:14,070
bones, he learned more about its legs, arms,
and head.

645
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:21,590
In the same way, when William Buckland found
Megalosaurus, he knew that it was a meat-eater,

646
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:25,400
because of its sharp teeth.

647
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:33,730
Trace fossils are things like dinosaur footprints,
eggs, and dung. Dinosaur footprints can tell

648
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:42,000
us how it walked. Did it walk on two feet
or four? How fast could it run? The footprints

649
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:49,500
of one theropod from Texas show that it was
running at 39 kilometres per hour, faster

650
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,430
than a horse!

651
01:24:52,430 --> 01:25:00,650
The eggs and nests tell us about dinosaur
babies and family life. And dinosaur dung?

652
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:07,330
Yes, scientists look at this carefully too.
When they find bits of plants or animals in

653
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:14,860
it, they know what the dinosaur was eating.
(The dung is millions of years old, and has

654
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:20,520
become hard like rock, so it does not smell
bad.)

655
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:29,200
Today, scientists use computers to make pictures
of dinosaur bones, to see how they worked.

656
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:33,490
They can watch the dinosaurs moving on the
computer.

657
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:41,670
How do we know that meat-eaters like Tyrannosaurus
rex killed other dinosaurs? The scientist

658
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:50,880
Robert Bakker answers that. He calls himself
a murder detective. Dinosaur scientists, he

659
01:25:50,880 --> 01:26:01,460
says, 'dig up murder victims from 144 million
years ago. Then we figure out who killed them.'

660
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:09,740
How does he do that? He looks for 'bullets'
and 'bullet wounds'. The 'bullets' are dinosaur

661
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:17,230
teeth. Meat-eating dinosaurs often lost one
or two teeth when they killed, or were eating,

662
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:25,240
other dinosaurs. They grew new ones later.
So when Bakker finds teeth near a dead diplodocus,

663
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:32,920
it is like finding a bullet near a dead man.
If he finds allosaur teeth, he knows that

664
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,900
an allosaur was the killer.

665
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:42,460
And when he finds tooth damage on bones, the
damage is like 'bullet wounds'. It also gives

666
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:46,580
him information about the killer.

667
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:55,401
Were dinosaurs cold-blooded, like lizards
and fish, or warm-blooded, like mammals? Cold-blooded

668
01:26:55,401 --> 01:27:02,570
animals do not need much food, and move slowly
when it is cold. Warm-blooded animals need

669
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:09,080
much more food, and move quickly, even in
cold weather.

670
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:16,721
Lizards are cold-blooded, and until the 1970s
scientists thought that dinosaurs were big

671
01:27:16,721 --> 01:27:25,740
lizards. But today, most scientists think
that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. John Ostrom

672
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:32,230
thinks Deinonychus was warm-blooded, because
it could move so quickly. And some dinosaurs

673
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:38,940
lived in Antarctica, which was not always
warm even in the Cretaceous. We know that

674
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:47,530
dinosaurs grew very quickly too, and cold-blooded
animals do not do that. So most dinosaurs

675
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:51,680
were probably warm-blooded, like us.

676
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:58,380
But there are plenty of things we do not know.
What type of noise did Parasaurolophus make?

677
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:08,410
Did it really sing? Lots of dinosaurs probably
made noises, but nobody has ever heard them.

678
01:28:08,410 --> 01:28:17,140
And what colour were dinosaurs? Again, nobody
knows, because colour does not stay in fossils.

679
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:23,630
But dinosaurs were probably colourful, like
birds and animals today. Think of the large

680
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:32,630
frills on the heads of Protoceratops and Triceratops,
or the 'hat' on Lambeosaurus. They were probably

681
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:38,570
there to frighten enemies, and to attract
females. And a brightly coloured frill is

682
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:41,600
much easier to see.

683
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:48,210
Lots of birds today are brightly coloured.
And many dinosaurs, like birds, had feathers.

684
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:54,590
So lots of dinosaurs were probably covered
with beautiful feathers, just like birds.

685
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:57,400
But what colour were they?

686
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:04,860
Nobody knows.

687
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:07,740
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Dinosaurs Today

688
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:26,920
In 1896, the rich Scottish-American businessman
Andrew Carnegie built a Museum of Natural

689
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:34,250
History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Carnegie
wanted the biggest dinosaur in the world for

690
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:42,050
his museum, so he asked his scientists to
find one. At Sheep Creek, near the Freezeout

691
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:50,470
Mountains in Wyoming, they found what they
wanted - an enormous diplodocus. At that time,

692
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:57,740
it was the biggest dinosaur in the world.
They called it Diplodocus carnegii, giving

693
01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:06,230
it Carnegie's name. Carnegie was very happy.
But he had a problem: his museum was not big

694
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:14,730
enough. So he had to build a huge, new room,
just to keep his diplodocus in.

695
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:20,840
When King Edward the Seventh of England visited
Carnegie at his castle in Scotland, he saw

696
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:23,220
a picture of Carnegie's diplodocus.

697
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:30,340
'I say, Carnegie, what in the world is this?'
the king asked.

698
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:35,430
Carnegie smiled and told him that it was the
biggest animal that ever lived - and that

699
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,450
it had Carnegie's name.

700
01:30:37,450 --> 01:30:47,270
'Oh! I say, Carnegie,' the king said. 'We
must have one of these in the British Museum.'

701
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:55,460
Carnegie loved to be important, so in 1905,
he sent a model of his diplodocus to the Natural

702
01:30:55,460 --> 01:31:02,780
History Museum in London. Later, he sent models
to museums in Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Bologna,

703
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:13,470
St Petersburg, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Mexico
City, and Munich.

704
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:19,260
Carnegie's diplodocus is one of the most popular
dinosaurs in the world. Millions of people

705
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:27,440
see it every year, all over the world. In
London, the diplodocus is called 'Dippy.'

706
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:33,180
Children sometimes spend the night in the
Natural History Museum, sleeping under Dippy

707
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:36,940
and learning about other dinosaurs.

708
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:43,771
In Carnegie's Pittsburgh Museum, there is
a tyrannosaurus rex called 'Samson'. Children

709
01:31:43,771 --> 01:31:51,510
love that too. It is fun to sleep under a
diplodocus, or to stand in front of a tyrannosaurus

710
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:59,010
like Samson in a museum. There are many other
museums with dinosaurs to see too. Some of

711
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:04,970
the best are the Field Museum in Chicago,
the American Museum of Natural History in

712
01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:14,550
New York, the Natural History Museum in Beijing,
and the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Alberta, Canada.

713
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:20,171
If you cannot see a real dinosaur, you can
still play with one on your computer. And

714
01:32:20,171 --> 01:32:26,970
you can have fun with dinosaur games too.
Dinosaurs have appeared in hundreds of computer

715
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:37,010
games since 1986. In 1990, a likeable green
dinosaur called 'Yoshi' appeared in the computer

716
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:44,980
game Super Mario World - he soon became famous,
and even had his own games. But with their

717
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:52,070
sharp teeth and claws, and enormous bodies,
dinosaurs are more often seen in fighting

718
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:59,980
games. Since 1997, millions of people have
enjoyed fighting dangerous dinosaurs in the

719
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:08,370
seven very successful Turok games. And in
the last five years, dinosaur games have become

720
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:18,950
even more popular, with new games like Dino
Run, Dino D-Day and Velociraptor Safari.

721
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:26,420
But can you imagine a world with dinosaurs
and humans together? In the 1900s, people

722
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:33,120
began to write books about this idea. One
of the first was The Lost World by Sir Arthur

723
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:41,290
Conan Doyle. In this book, a scientist called
Professor Challenger discovers dinosaurs still

724
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:45,170
living on a mountain in South America.

725
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:51,900
More recently, Michael Crichton's book Jurassic
Park - later a popular film by Steven Spielberg

726
01:33:51,900 --> 01:34:00,360
- uses the same idea. In this book, scientists
find dinosaur blood in the stomach of a fossilized

727
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:06,090
insect. They use this blood to make new dinosaurs.

728
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:15,190
Is this really possible? Scientists say no
- well, not yet. And that is a good thing.

729
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:21,920
After all, dinosaurs are much, much bigger
than us. If we bring back dinosaurs, we will

730
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:29,100
not be able to talk to them, or make friends
with them. And when a tyrannosaur sees a human,

731
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,740
it will think just one thing-lunch!

732
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:43,530
Remember, birds are dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus
was, in some ways, like an enormous chicken.

733
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:51,470
So if you want to see a real living dinosaur,
watch a group of hungry chickens eating their

734
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:56,280
food. Then think of a chicken as big as a
house.

735
01:34:56,280 --> 01:35:04,380
Do you really want the dinosaurs to come back?

736
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:17,930
- THE END -
