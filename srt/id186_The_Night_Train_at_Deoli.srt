00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:09,830
THE NIGHT TRAIN AT DEOLI

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,210
There are some moments in life that are never
forgotten.

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:21,220
It can be anything - a favourite toy from
childhood, a time of shared laughter, the

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:30,679
pain of lost love, the scent of a flower,
sunlight on a distant mountain top, the platform

5
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:59,590
of a small railway station in northern India,
in the soft quiet light of early morning...

6
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:05,920
When I was at college, I used to spend my
summer holidays at Dehra, at my grandmother's

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,070
place.

8
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,320
I stayed there in the hills from early May
until late in July.

9
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,430
Deoli was a small station about thirty miles
from Dehra; it marked the beginning of the

10
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,800
heavy jungles of the Indian Terai area.

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,380
The train used to reach Deoli at about five
in the morning, when the station was poorly

12
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,740
lit with oil lamps, and the jungle across
the railway line was just visible in the early

13
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,409
light of day.

14
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:47,960
Deoli only had one platform, a waiting room,
and an office for the stationmaster.

15
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:56,500
On the platform there was a tea stall, a fruit
seller, and a few thin, hungry dogs; not much

16
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,840
else, because the train stopped there for
only ten minutes before rushing on into the

17
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,820
forests.

18
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,900
Why it stopped at Deoli, I don't know.

19
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,479
Nothing ever happened there.

20
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,489
Nobody got off the train and nobody got on.

21
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:20,920
But the train always stopped there a full
ten minutes, and then a bell sounded, the

22
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:28,730
guard blew his whistle, and soon Deoli was
left behind and forgotten.

23
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,800
I used to wonder what happened in Deoli, behind
the station walls.

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,860
I always felt sorry for that lonely little
platform, and for the place that nobody wanted

25
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,760
to visit.

26
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:49,030
I decided that one day I would get off the
train at Deoli, and spend the day there, just

27
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,920
to please the town.

28
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,420
I was eighteen, visiting my grandmother, and
the night train stopped at Deoli.

29
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,459
A girl came down the platform, selling baskets.

30
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:10,230
It was a cold morning and the girl had a shawl
thrown across her shoulders.

31
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:18,720
Her feet were bare and her clothes were old,
but she was a young girl, walking like a queen.

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,519
When she came to my window, she stopped.

33
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:29,070
She saw that I was staring at her, but at
first she pretended not to notice.

34
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:36,709
She had a pale skin, shiny black hair, and
dark, troubled eyes.

35
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:43,830
And then those eyes, searching and expressive,
met mine.

36
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:50,319
She stood by my window for some time and neither
of us said anything.

37
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,980
But when she moved on, I found myself leaving
my seat and going to the door.

38
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:03,420
I stepped out and stood waiting on the platform,
looking the other way, away from her.

39
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,220
I walked across to the tea stall.

40
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,900
Water was boiling over a small fire, but the
owner of the stall was busy serving tea somewhere

41
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,490
on the train.

42
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,590
The girl followed me to the stall.

43
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,949
'Do you want to buy a basket?'

44
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:20,949
she asked.

45
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:25,580
'They are very strong, made of the finest...'

46
00:04:25,580 --> 00:06:34,490
'No,' I said, 'I don't want a basket.'

47
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,100
suddenly filled with light.

48
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:44,020
We said nothing for some time, but we each
knew what the other was feeling.

49
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:50,949
I wanted to put her on the train there and
then, and take her away with me.

50
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:57,849
I hated the idea of having to watch her disappear
into the distance of Deoli station.

51
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:03,169
I took the baskets from her hand and put them
down on the ground.

52
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:08,600
She put out her hand for one of them, but
I caught her hand and held it.

53
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,040
'I have to go to Delhi,' I said.

54
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,110
She nodded.

55
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,509
'I do not have to go anywhere.'

56
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:21,889
The guard blew his whistle for the train to
leave.

57
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,880
How I hated him for doing that!

58
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,440
'I will come again,' I said.

59
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,560
'Will you be here?'

60
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,020
She nodded again, and as she nodded, the bell
rang and the train started to move.

61
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,860
I had to pull my hand away from the girl and
run for the moving train.

62
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,050
This time I did not forget her.

63
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,960
She was with me for the rest of the journey,
and for long afterwards.

64
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,740
All that year she was a bright, living thing
in my mind.

65
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,970
And when college finished, I packed and left
for Dehra earlier than usual.

66
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,110
My grandmother would be pleased at my eagerness
to see her.

67
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,690
I was anxious as the train entered Deoli,
because I was wondering what I should say

68
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,979
to the girl and what I should do.

69
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:19,900
I was determined not to stand helplessly in
front of her, unable to speak or express my

70
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,800
feelings.

71
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,280
The train came to Deoli, and I looked up and
down the platform, but I could not see the

72
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,050
girl anywhere.

73
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:37,380
I opened the door and stepped on to the platform,
deeply disappointed, and fearing the worst.

74
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,800
I ran up to the stationmaster and said, 'Do
you know the girl who used to sell baskets

75
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,839
here?'

76
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,580
'No, I don't,' he replied.

77
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,370
'And you'd better get on the train if you
don't want to be left behind.'

78
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:57,880
But I walked up and down the platform, and
stared past the station buildings.

79
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:04,000
All I saw was a tree and a dusty road leading
into the jungle.

80
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,300
Where did the road go?

81
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,230
The train was moving out of the station, and
I had to run up the platform and jump for

82
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,260
the door of my compartment.

83
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:20,230
Then, as the train gathered speed, I sat miserably
in front of the window.

84
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,380
What could I do about finding a girl I had
seen only twice, who had said very little

85
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:35,500
to me, and about whom I knew nothing - absolutely
nothing - but for whom I felt a fondness and

86
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,010
responsibility that I had never felt before?

87
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,730
My grandmother was not pleased with my visit
after all, because I only stayed at her place

88
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,779
for a couple of weeks.

89
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:53,140
Feeling restless and worried, I took the train
back, intending to ask further questions of

90
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,220
the stationmaster at Deoli.

91
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,430
But at Deoli there was a new stationmaster.

92
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:06,510
The previous man had been moved to another
station, and the new man didn't know anything

93
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,490
about the girl who sold baskets.

94
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,880
I found the owner of the tea stall, and asked
him if he knew anything about the girl with

95
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,240
the baskets.

96
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,279
'Yes, there was such a girl here, I remember
quite well,' he said.

97
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,490
'But she has stopped coming now.'

98
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,490
'Why?'

99
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,490
I asked.

100
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,620
'What happened to her?'

101
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,529
'How should I know?' he said.

102
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:31,070
'She was nothing to me.'

103
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,550
And once again I had to run for the train.

104
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:41,280
As Deoli platform slid away, I decided that
one day I would have to break my journey there,

105
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,290
spend a day in the town, make enquiries, and
find the girl who had stolen my heart with

106
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,981
nothing but a look from her dark, impatient
eyes.

107
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:57,690
I cheered myself up with this thought during
my last few months in college.

108
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:03,180
I went to Dehra again in the summer and when,
in the early hours of the morning, the night

109
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:09,370
train came into Deoli station, I looked up
and down the platform for signs of the girl,

110
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,720
knowing I wouldn't find her but hoping just
the same.

111
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,550
Somehow, I couldn't bring myself to break
my journey at Deoli and spend a day there.

112
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:26,029
(If this was a film, I thought, I'd get off
the train, solve the mystery, and provide

113
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:28,670
a suitable ending for the whole thing.)

114
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,720
I think I was afraid to do this.

115
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,770
I was afraid of discovering what had really
happened to the girl.

116
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:45,750
Perhaps she was no longer in Deoli, perhaps
she was married, perhaps she had fallen ill...

117
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,899
In the last few years I have passed through
Deoli many times, and I always look out of

118
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:58,959
the train window, half expecting to see the
same unchanged face smiling up at me.

119
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,740
I wonder what happens in Deoli, behind the
station walls.

120
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,959
But I will never break my journey there.

121
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,899
I prefer to keep hoping and dreaming, and
looking out of the window up and down that

122
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,500
lonely platform, waiting for the girl with
the baskets.

123
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:27,720
I never break my journey at Deoli, but I pass
through as often as I can.

124
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,050
- THE END -
