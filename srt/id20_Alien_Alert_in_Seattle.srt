CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,290
Alien Alert!

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,730
My name's Karen Nielsen and I'm fifteen years
old.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,450
I'm tall and I have short red hair and green
eyes.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,279
I live in Seattle, Washington.

6
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:22,160
It's a wonderful, green city and I love it.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,380
I live with my parents and my dog, Tex, in
a yellow house with a lovely garden.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,370
Tex is a big brown dog and he's three years
old.

9
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,649
I have a lot of fun playing with him.

10
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:43,300
In my free time I like playing volleyball,
going rock climbing and listening to music.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,220
I have a big music collection and I love listening
to music with my friends.

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,520
I also like reading science fiction books.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,800
My story begins in August, a month before
school started.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,149
My parents and I were having breakfast in
the kitchen and we were watching the local

15
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,299
news on the television.

16
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,810
Suddenly the newsreader said, "Alien Alert!

17
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,850
Early this morning there was a report of an
unidentified flying object near the Cascade

18
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,590
Mountains east of Seattle.

19
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,200
Two tourists saw a UFO in the sky above them.

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,180
They said it was gray and round.

21
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,290
They also said it didn't make any noise.

22
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,940
Later this morning a high school teacher saw
the same UFO flying above her house.

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,900
The Seattle Police are investigating."

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,950
"Wow!"

25
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,950
I said.

26
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,490
"An alien spaceship here in Seattle!

27
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,200
This is exciting!"

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,180
"Do you believe it?" asked my mom.

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,640
"Who knows?

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,250
I don't think we're alone in this big universe,"
said my dad.

31
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,590
"The Earth is only a small planet, you know."

32
00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:00,939
I started thinking about aliens and went to
the library to look at some books about UFOs.

33
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:05,380
That evening all the newspapers had "ALIEN
ALERT!"

34
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,119
on their front pages.

35
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,500
A month later I went back to high school.

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,459
This is my second year at Washington High
School and I like it a lot.

37
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:21,510
When I finish school and university I want
to become a chemist.

38
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,930
On the way to school I met my best friend
and classmate, Barbara Reynolds.

39
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,610
She is a tall, pretty girl.

40
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,230
She lives near my house and we always walk
to school together.

41
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,230
She is Afro - American and one of the best
students at our school.

42
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,110
She wants to become a doctor.

43
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,830
Basketball is her sport and she plays on the
girls' basketball team.

44
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,190
Like myself, she also enjoys listening to
music.

45
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,569
"We have some new teachers this year," said
Barbara happily.

46
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:56,959
"I hope they're all men and cute!"

47
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,200
"Me too.

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,909
We need something new and interesting in our
lives," I said laughing.

49
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:06,680
Barbara and I like talking about boys and
clothes; it is fun.

50
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,190
"Did you buy any new clothes for school?"

51
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,269
she asked.

52
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,370
"I bought these new jeans and this black belt,"
I said.

53
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,400
"The jeans look great with the pink T-shirt,"
she told me.

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,060
"I bought this new blue jacket and white trainers
for the fall."

55
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,909
"Did you hear about the news about that UFO
near the Cascade Mountains last month?"

56
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:29,080
I then asked.

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,680
"I was in California visiting my grandmother
so I didn't hear much, but I read about it

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,739
online," said Barbara.

59
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,060
"People see at least one every month in the
United States, but no one has ever seen an

60
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,060
alien."

61
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,260
"Do you think they really exist?"

62
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,260
I asked.

63
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,239
"I don't think we're alone in the universe,"
she said.

64
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,800
"But it's a mystery..."

65
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,319
"I agree."

66
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,200
We got to school at half past eight and went
to our first class, science.

67
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,700
There was a man of about thirty in the classroom.

68
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,810
"Hello, I'm Mr Kent, your new science teacher,"
he said.

69
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,470
Barbara and I looked at him.

70
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,220
He was tall and quite slim.

71
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,200
He had blond hair and brown eyes.

72
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,500
He was well-dressed and had a friendly face.

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,220
"We're lucky!"

74
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,460
whispered Barbara.

75
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,790
"He's really cute."

76
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,130
"You're right!"

77
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,010
I whispered laughing.

78
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,640
"What's your name?" he asked, smiling at me.

79
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,690
"Hi, I'm Karen Nielsen," I answered.

80
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,560
Then he looked at Barbara and asked, "And
who are you?"

81
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,210
"My name's Barbara Reynolds."

82
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:46,240
At that moment an airplane passed over our
school and made a lot of noise.

83
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,760
Everyone in class looked out of the window,
but the sun was very bright in front of us

84
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,480
and it hurt our eyes.

85
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,390
We turned away from the window, but Mr Kent
didn't.

86
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,810
He looked directly at the airplane and at
the sun.

87
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:07,350
How strange, I thought, the sun doesn't hurt
his eyes.

88
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,720
When the science lesson was over we went to
the English lesson.

89
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,220
The new teacher was a very thin man with black
hair and green eyes.

90
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,530
He had a small nose and a pale face.

91
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,130
"What a strange teacher!"

92
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,150
I whispered to Barbara.

93
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,910
"Very strange!"

94
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,440
she whispered.

95
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,370
The new teacher didn't smile and spoke slowly
and coldly to the class.

96
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,210
"My name is Mr Wilkinson and I'm your new
English teacher.

97
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,590
I don't want any talking in class.

98
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,020
This year we're going to study William Shakespeare
and other great writers."

99
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,020
"Ugh!

100
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,060
How boring!" said two boys, who were sitting
at the back of the class.

101
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,690
"Stop that now!" said Mr Wilkinson.

102
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,560
"Now open your literature books at page five."

103
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,690
His voice was strange: he sounded like, a
robot.

104
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,550
Barbara touched my arm and whispered, "He's
terrible!

105
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,120
How are we going to survive this class?"

106
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:22,440
I looked at her and whispered back, "I have
absolutely no idea.

107
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,840
CHAPTER TWO

108
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,750
A Strange New Teacher

109
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,560
Everyone at school had lunch at 12.30 in the
cafeteria.

110
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,240
I always had lunch with Barbara and Walter
Andrews, a sixteen- year-old boy.

111
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,880
He was tall and had dark brown hair and dark
eyes, and I liked him.

112
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,630
He was a quiet boy and didn't have many friends.

113
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:53,400
His favorite subjects were math and science,
and he liked computers a lot.

114
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,900
His parents were divorced and he lived with
his father and his cat, Tootsie.

115
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,610
He was often lonely because he never saw his
mother and his father was always at work.

116
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,090
He loved Tootsie and spent a lot of time with
her.

117
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,620
"What do you think of our new teachers?"

118
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,570
I asked Barbara and Walter.

119
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,180
"Well, I think Mr Kent is really cute.

120
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,160
He's friendly too," said Barbara.

121
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,530
"But did you see the way he looked at the
airplane?

122
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,370
The sun didn't hurt his eyes," said Walter.

123
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,550
"Did you hear Mr Wilkinson's voice?"

124
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,730
I asked.

125
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,700
"He talks like a robot; his voice is so cold."

126
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,060
"And he's unfriendly," said Barbara.

127
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,250
"Hey, look over there.

128
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,800
Look at what he's drinking!"

129
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,880
whispered Walter.

130
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,770
We all looked at Mr Wilkinson who was sitting
by himself in a corner of the cafeteria.

131
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,380
He had a strange lunch.

132
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,090
There was a glass of green juice in front
of him, and on the table there were some black

133
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,940
pills.

134
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:02,070
He put two of them into the glass and the
green juice started to make bubbles.

135
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,610
Then suddenly it changed color and became
red.

136
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,980
Mr Wilkinson took the glass and slowly drank
the mysterious red juice.

137
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,890
We looked at each other nervously, but then
started laughing.

138
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,720
"How can he drink that?"

139
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
I said.

140
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,080
"Perhaps it's a new diet," said Barbara, "and
that's why he's so thin!"

141
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,340
"I don't think so," Walter said.

142
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,440
"There's something strange about our English
teacher," I said.

143
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,580
The next morning during the English lesson
Mr Wilkinson started asking us some personal

144
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,090
questions.

145
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,590
"Andrews.

146
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,480
Walter Andrews," said Mr Wilkinson.

147
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,180
"Tell me something about yourself."

148
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,720
Walter was surprised because teachers didn't
usually ask personal questions.

149
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,240
"Well, I like computers, and my hobby is astronomy,"
he said.

150
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,800
"I have a small telescope and I like looking
at the stars.

151
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,740
I have a pet called Tootsie; she's a black
and white cat."

152
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,740
"Good!

153
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,640
You have an interesting hobby.

154
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,570
Thank you, Walter," said Mr Wilkinson.

155
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,010
He then asked other students about their life
and hobbies.

156
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,760
"H mm," I thought, "perhaps he wants to know
more about us.

157
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,310
How strange!"

158
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:32,620
Then I looked at him carefully and I noticed
something: his eyes were not green anymore.

159
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,390
They were a different color today!

160
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,820
I suddenly had an idea.

161
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,290
I put up my hand and asked, "May I go to the
bathroom, please?"

162
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,840
"Yes, of course," Mr Wilkinson answered.

163
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,920
As I walked towards the door I looked at his
eyes again.

164
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,030
I was right - they were blue!

165
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,300
They looked like the sea.

166
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,120
I was surprised and a little scared.

167
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,150
That afternoon I decided to go to Walter's
house.

168
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,770
He was sitting in front of his computer.

169
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:11,510
He was very interested in aliens and life
on other planets.

170
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:17,140
There were posters of the solar system and
the constellations on the wall of his room.

171
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,770
"Did you hear about the alien alert last month?"

172
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,040
I asked.

173
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,960
"Yeah, in the Cascade Mountains, right near
Seattle!" said Walter.

174
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,210
"The news was exciting, but the police and
the newspapers never tell us the truth.

175
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,570
I'm sure there are UFOs and aliens in the
universe."

176
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,670
"What are you looking at now?"

177
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,670
I asked.

178
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,080
"I'm on the Internet, on the International
Space Club site," he said excitedly.

179
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,480
"Listen to this, Karen.

180
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,190
Something very important is happening.

181
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,880
A comet is passing through the Virgo constellation.

182
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,450
When a comet and a constellation meet, aliens
can travel to our planet!

183
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,880
Everything is right for intergalactic voyages!"

184
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,170
"What are intergalactic voyages?"

185
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,290
I asked.

186
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,550
"They're when you can travel from one galaxy
to another," Walter said.

187
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:13,840
"They can take place only at special times,
for example, when a constellation and a comet

188
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
meet.

189
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,560
Some people say aliens come to Earth to attack
us.

190
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,160
But I think they want to study us."

191
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,240
"Wow, you know everything about space!"

192
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
I said.

193
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,560
"I love space," said Walter, smiling.

194
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,810
"I want to become an astronaut.

195
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,240
I want to go to another galaxy and perhaps
meet aliens!"

196
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
"Wow!

197
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,190
That's interesting and dangerous," I said
and started thinking.

198
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,870
Suddenly I had an idea.

199
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,550
"Perhaps Mr Wilkinson is... an alien!"

200
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,810
I said slowly.

201
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,150
"What!" he cried, looking at me.

202
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,010
"Oh, Karen, you read too many science fiction
books!

203
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,750
He's not an alien."

204
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:04,650
"Well, his voice doesn't sound human, his
eyes change color and he has a very strange

205
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,770
lunch," I said.

206
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,980
"What do you mean, his eyes change color?"
he asked surprised.

207
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,880
"Didn't you notice?"

208
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,970
I said.

209
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,700
"Yesterday they were green and today they
were blue!"

210
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,180
"Are you sure?" he asked.

211
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,600
"Of course I'm sure," I said excitedly.

212
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,721
"Listen, Walter, there was a UFO sighting
last month and Mr Wilkinson is a new teacher

213
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:32,880
at Washington High.

214
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,810
No one knows where he comes from!

215
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,910
Perhaps he arrived on that UFO."

216
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,480
Walter looked at me with his big, dark eyes
and said, "Well, it's possible!

217
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,860
He has got a very strange face and his voice
is really cold.

218
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,480
Perhaps he is an alien!

219
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,279
And that's why he asked us those personal
questions - he wants to study us."

220
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,279
"Exactly!"

221
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,279
I said.

222
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,690
"But let's study him, too!

223
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:08,900
We can follow him and see were hi lives.

224
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,520
CHAPTER THREE

225
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,800
A Sad Story

226
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,490
"Good morning!"

227
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,410
Mr Kent said, smiling.

228
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,330
"Today we're going to the lab to do some practical
work."

229
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:27,270
The lab was a big room with long tables, chairs
and big cupboards.

230
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,279
There were white mice in cages.

231
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:35,820
When Mr Kent walked by their cages they all
started running around and making a lot of

232
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,820
noise.

233
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,100
"What's the matter?"

234
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,110
laughed Mr Kent, speaking to the white mice.

235
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,650
"Are you afraid of me?

236
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,870
I won't eat you!"

237
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:50,100
Then he looked at the class and said, "Today's
lesson is about worms.

238
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,020
I'm going to give you some worms and you have
to cut them in half.

239
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,250
The two pieces can live and move by themselves.

240
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,710
You'll see."

241
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,870
I was not happy.

242
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,089
I looked at my worm.

243
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:05,470
It was long and green.

244
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,600
I didn't want to cut it.

245
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,089
"Karen, are you afraid of your worm?" asked
Mr Kent, smiling.

246
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,680
"Give me your knife and I can help you."

247
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,740
His arm touched mine and I got an electric
shock - I jumped up from my chair.

248
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,820
"What's wrong Karen?" asked Mr Kent.

249
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,900
"Oh, nothing, nothing," I said, trying to
smile.

250
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:36,330
He cut the worm and then walked to the next
table to help other students.

251
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:41,160
I wrote a note to Walter and told him about
the electric shock.

252
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,440
"Walter!"

253
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,740
I whispered.

254
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,600
He turned around and I gave him the note.

255
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,330
"Walter and Karen, what are you doing?" asked
Mr Kent.

256
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,690
"What do you have in your hand, Walter?"

257
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,180
His voice scared me.

258
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,180
Walter and I were in big trouble with the
teacher.

259
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,730
"Ah, n...nothing," said Walter.

260
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,350
"Please pay attention!" said Mr Kent.

261
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,860
"Next time you'll have to give me the note."

262
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,800
"I'm sorry, Mr Kent," said Walter.

263
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,770
When the science lesson was over Mr Kent called
me to his desk.

264
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,850
"Oh, no...," I thought.

265
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,950
"I'm sorry I scared you during the lesson.

266
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,940
Two years ago I had a bad car accident and
lost my arm.

267
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,330
My left arm is artificial - it's an electric
arm.

268
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,770
Sometimes it gives electric shocks."

269
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,790
I was surprised and sorry.

270
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:42,029
At lunch I told Walter and Barbara about Mr
Kent's electric arm.

271
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:44,740
They were both surprised.

272
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,550
As we walked out of the cafeteria we saw Mr
Wilkinson.

273
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,560
"Hello, Mr Wilkinson," said Barbara.

274
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,750
"Oh, uh... hi," he said, looking at us.

275
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,649
His eyes were green again, but I didn't say
anything.

276
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:06,690
At half past three Walter and I ran out of
the school and waited for Mr Wilkinson to

277
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,580
walk by.

278
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,990
We saw a lot of students and teachers, but
we didn't see him.

279
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,440
Finally we saw him walking down the street
and we followed him silently.

280
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,040
He lived near the school in a pretty white
house.

281
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,730
There was a small garden around it and a big
tree near the front door.

282
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:35,250
He walked into his house and we went quietly
to a window and looked inside.

283
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,730
He put some books on the kitchen table and
opened the refrigerator.

284
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:45,020
He took out a bottle of the horrible green
juice and put it on the table.

285
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,770
Then he went upstairs.

286
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,850
"Oh, no," said Walter, "he went upstairs."

287
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,240
"No problem!"

288
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
I said.

289
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
"I can climb up this tree."

290
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,000
"Are you sure?" asked Walter surprised.

291
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,320
"Of course," I said laughing.

292
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,170
"Don't forget, I go rock climbing."

293
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,189
"Well, be careful, Karen," said Walter.

294
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:10,400
I climbed up the tree and I could see Mr Wilkinson's
bedroom.

295
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,780
"What's happening?"

296
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,230
whispered Walter.

297
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,589
"He's in his bedroom and he's sitting in front
of a mirror," I whispered back.

298
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,030
"His hands are on his hair...

299
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,100
Oh, no!"

300
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,100
"What?

301
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,220
Tell me!" asked Walter.

302
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,160
I continued looking into the house.

303
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,620
Mr Wilkinson was now completely bald!

304
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,400
I felt cold.

305
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,610
Suddenly I saw my face in Mr Wilkinson's mirror
and he saw it too.

306
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,650
He turned around and looked at me.

307
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,220
I was terrified and didn't know what to do.

308
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,040
I could not run away because I was at the
top of a big tree.

309
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,670
But Mr Wilkinson didn't look angry; he looked
sad.

310
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,660
He walked over and opened the window.

311
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,920
"Karen!

312
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,020
What are you doing up this tree?" he asked.

313
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,580
"I... uh..."

314
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,820
"Please climb down," he said.

315
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,350
"I want to talk to you."

316
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,790
I climbed down the tree and Walter was waiting
for me.

317
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,200
He looked very worried.

318
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,410
"Come on, Karen, let's run away!" he said.

319
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,730
"No, Walter, we can't," I said.

320
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,000
"Mr Wilkinson wants to talk to us."

321
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,950
Mr Wilkinson came out of his house and stood
in the garden.

322
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,260
"You students think I'm strange," he said
quietly.

323
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,240
"I can understand why."

324
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,530
Walter and I were terrified.

325
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,390
"Let me tell you my story.

326
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,960
Last year my doctor told me I was very ill.

327
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,200
I had cancer."

328
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,650
"Oh, how terrible!

329
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,520
I'm really sorry," I said.

330
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,020
"Yes, it was terrible.

331
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,260
I had an operation and then chemotherapy.

332
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:07,380
After the operation I lost my voice, so now
I speak with a type of artificial voice.

333
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,220
That's why my voice sounds strange.

334
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,200
I lost all my hair from the chemotherapy,
so now I wear a wig."

335
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,700
"We didn't know...," said Walter.

336
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,410
"Mr Wilkinson, we're very sorry about our
terrible behavior," said Walter.

337
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,710
"Yes, please forgive us," I said.

338
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:33,670
"Oh, don't worry, I am getting better now
which is good," he said quietly.

339
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,429
"May I ask you a question?"

340
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:37,429
Walter said.

341
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:38,650
"Of course!"

342
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,800
"What's that green juice you drink at lunch?"

343
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,380
Walter asked.

344
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,860
He smiled and said, "The green juice and the
black pills are medicines."

345
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,090
"But why do your eyes change color?"

346
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,360
I asked.

347
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,930
"So, you saw that, did you?

348
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,250
You kids see everything!" said Mr Wilkinson.

349
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:08,250
"I wanted to do something different so I bought
a pair of colored contact lenses.

350
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,610
I thought a new look could make me feel better."

351
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,540
"Did the contact lenses make you feel better?"

352
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,309
I asked.

353
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:18,940
Mr Wilkinson looked at me and smiled.

354
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,700
"A little, it was nice having something different
for a day.

355
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,450
But it's my job that is really making me feel
better."

356
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,610
"You like your job, don't you?" asked Walter.

357
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:35,220
"I love my job," said Mr Wilkinson, smiling.

358
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,960
"It's wonderful to work with young people
like you."

359
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,950
"Do you like Seattle?"

360
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,100
I asked.

361
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,400
"Yes, I do," said Mr Wilkinson.

362
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,020
"It's a beautiful city with lots of parks
and fun things to do.

363
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,740
And I'm starting to make a few friends."

364
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,880
"Good," I said, smiling.

365
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,760
"Welcome to the Emerald City!"

366
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,030
We all laughed.

367
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,490
CHAPTER FOUR

368
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,210
Who's in the Computer Room?

369
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:15,900
After leaving Mr Wilkinson's house, Walter
and I talked about our visit.

370
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,980
Both of us felt very sorry about our behavior.

371
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,930
"I think we learned a big lesson today," said
Walter.

372
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:28,309
"Some people seem strange because they have
problems - big problems.

373
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:32,400
But they're people just like you and me, and
they need our help and friendship."

374
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,549
"I agree with you, Walter," I said.

375
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:43,160
"But we learned two important lessons today,
thanks to Mr Wilkinson: we must help and understand

376
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,700
others.

377
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,090
And it's not nice to invade someone's privacy."

378
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,090
I thought about Mr Kent and his artificial
arm.

379
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,130
He was another person with a big problem.

380
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,700
"Well, the mystery is solved," I said.

381
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,559
"Mr Wilkinson isn't an alien!

382
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,570
He's a very nice teacher.

383
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,280
We walked in silence for a few minutes.

384
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,670
We were both thinking about Mr Wilkinson.

385
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,930
"Hey, do you want to get an ice cream now?"

386
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,650
I finally asked Walter.

387
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,260
"Good idea!"

388
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
Walter said.

389
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,600
"Let's invite Barbara."

390
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,370
"Yeah, let's," I said.

391
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,840
"It's almost five o'clock and basketball practice
is over.

392
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,620
I'll send her a text message."

393
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:36,030
Thirty minutes later we met Barbara and we
sat down by the sea and ate our three large

394
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,410
ice creams.

395
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:42,070
"So, what's happening?" asked Barbara.

396
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,670
"We have a lot of news for you," I said.

397
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,670
"Really?

398
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,760
Well, don't make me wait.

399
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,750
Tell me immediately!" said Barbara laughing.

400
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:58,700
We told her everything: the news about the
comet, and the intergalactic voyages, and

401
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,140
how we had the idea that Mr Wilkinson was
an alien.

402
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:10,710
We told her about what happened when we followed
Mr Wilkinson home and the teacher's sad story.

403
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,530
Barbara listened carefully and she was very
surprised.

404
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,670
"The poor man," she said sadly.

405
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,760
"What a terrible problem!

406
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,840
And he's alone here in Seattle, isn't he?

407
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,770
Karen, let's make him a delicious chocolate
cake next weekend.

408
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,410
My mom can help us.

409
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,470
It'll be a welcome present."

410
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,790
"Yes, let's do it on Sunday afternoon.

411
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,770
Then we can take it to school on Monday,"
I said.

412
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,270
"He'll love it!"

413
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,980
"Well, girls, I'm not a good cook, but the
chocolate cake sounds great," said Walter.

414
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,980
"Now tell me more about intergalactic voyages,"
said Barbara.

415
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,750
"Yes, please do," I said.

416
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,080
"Perhaps aliens will come to visit Earth."

417
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,370
Walter told us a lot of interesting things
about UFOs and aliens.

418
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,120
I suddenly noticed that it was getting dark.

419
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,770
I tried to look at my watch but it wasn't
on my arm.

420
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,370
"Oh, no!"

421
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,370
I said.

422
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,550
"Where's my watch?"

423
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,550
Then I remembered.

424
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,740
"I took it off in the gym at lunchtime.

425
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,620
I'm sure I left it there near the showers
after volleyball.

426
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,960
I must go and get it now!"

427
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,120
"Don't worry, Karen, the janitor will find
it and put it in a safe place.

428
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,730
You can get it in the morning," said Barbara.

429
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:36,860
"But that watch is really important to me:
it was a present from my grandparents," I

430
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,860
said.

431
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,860
"But the school's closed at this time," said
Walter.

432
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:49,130
"No, it's not closed today because Mrs Wong
is preparing some math tests for her classes,"

433
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,130
I said.

434
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,680
"How do you know that?" asked Walter.

435
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,530
"I heard her talking to Miss Cruz this morning,"
I said.

436
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,070
"You know everything!" said Barbara smiling.

437
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,250
"OK then, we'll see you tomorrow morning."

438
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,770
Walter also smiled and said, "Good luck!"

439
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:12,150
I ran to Washington High and the main door
was open.

440
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:17,650
I went in and started going to the gym, but
something stopped me.

441
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:23,620
I had a strange feeling, but I didn't know
what it was.

442
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,710
Something was pushing me upstairs.

443
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,330
I was afraid because the school was dark and
silent.

444
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,610
I started going up the stairs to the first
floor.

445
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,320
"Where am I going?

446
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,340
The gym is downstairs.

447
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,640
Why am I going upstairs?"

448
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,070
I asked myself.

449
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:48,070
My heart was beating faster and faster.

450
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,049
Something was waiting for me at the top of
the stairs - I knew it.

451
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:54,210
But what was it?

452
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,820
I wanted to run home but I could not do it.

453
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,070
I had to find out.

454
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:07,530
When I got up to the third floor I saw a light
on in the computer room.

455
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,110
I went quietly to the door.

456
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,910
Someone was working in front of a computer.

457
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,690
It was Mr Kent!

458
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:21,720
He was writing a long line of numbers and
letters.

459
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,059
Suddenly I saw the face of an alien on his
computer screen!

460
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:32,299
The alien had a green head and big red eyes.

461
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,640
It didn't have a nose or any hair.

462
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,520
Its mouth and ears were very small.

463
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,670
Then Mr Kent put both of his hands on his
head.

464
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:48,200
He closed his eyes and started pulling his
hair.

465
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,870
He was taking his hair and his face off!

466
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:57,710
Suddenly Mr Kent had a green face like the
alien on the screen.

467
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,440
He was an alien!

468
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,580
I was terrified but I could not run away.

469
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,840
He started talking to the alien on the screen.

470
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,480
"Klyreg is calling home.

471
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,960
Klyreg here," he said.

472
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,630
"ALTANK PILLEX, Klyreg.

473
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,330
This is your leader speaking.

474
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,850
How are things going?" said the alien on the
screen with a strange voice.

475
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,520
"Everything is fine, Gortz, but I'm tired
of this mask.

476
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,760
Life as a human is difficult," he said.

477
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,289
"Your work on Earth is very important," said
the alien.

478
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:38,120
"You have to stay there until everything is
finished.

479
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,420
Did you choose the student who will come to
Mitrax?"

480
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:47,380
"No, I'm going to choose one tomorrow," said
Mr Kent.

481
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380
"What?"

482
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,380
I thought.

483
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,549
"He's going to take a student to another planet!

484
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:53,740
This is terrible!"

485
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,470
"There's little time, Klyreg.

486
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,640
You have to hurry.

487
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,080
Remember, we'll meet you and the student at
the old airfield behind the school on Friday

488
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,630
night at 9.30 p.m.

489
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,020
Don't be late!

490
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:12,870
When the comet leaves the Virgo constellation
at midnight the intergalactic doors close.

491
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,150
And then we can't return to Mitrax for another
six hundred years."

492
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,420
"I know, Gortz.

493
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,850
I won't be late," said Mr Kent.

494
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,470
"Good, but how will you get the student?

495
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,920
You can't touch him or her because you're
electric."

496
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,419
"I have a plan," said Mr Kent.

497
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:36,169
"On Friday evening there's a PTA meeting at
school.

498
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:41,110
There will be a lot of people here: teachers,
parents and students.

499
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:46,390
During the meeting I'll ask a student to come
with me to the science lab.

500
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,000
Then I'll spray him with my special X-5 spray.

501
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:59,730
With the X-5 spray humans can't think anymore,
they forget who they are - they can only obey.

502
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,039
The student will follow me to the old airfield."

503
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,810
"Everything on Mitrax is ready for the human,"
said the alien.

504
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,350
"We want to study him."

505
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,460
"Good.

506
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,740
ALTANK PILLEX, Gortz," said Mr Kent to the
alien.

507
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:24,880
Then he wrote a long line of numbers and letters
on the computer screen and it turned black.

508
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,640
I went quickly and quietly down the stairs
and ran out of the building.

509
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,400
I started running down the street and across
the park.

510
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:40,820
I could not stop thinking about the green
head and the big red eyes of the alien.

511
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:46,740
And I could not believe that Mr Kent was an
alien and he was planning something terrible.

512
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,919
What could I do to stop him?

513
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,140
I had to talk to Walter and Barbara.

514
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,990
I felt cold and my heart was beating fast.

515
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:04,150
I wanted to get home as fast as possible.

516
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,730
CHAPTER FIVE

517
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,380
The Plan

518
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,900
When I arrived at school the next day I went
to the gym to look for my watch.

519
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,679
I could not find it near the showers so I
went to ask the janitor.

520
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:24,210
"Hello, Mr Phillips," I said, "did you find
a watch near the showers yesterday?"

521
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,980
"Yes, I did," said Mr Phillips.

522
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,910
"Here it is!"

523
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,010
He took my watch out of a box on his desk
and smiled.

524
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,470
"Oh, that's great!

525
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:39,690
Thanks a lot," I said happily and ran to class.

526
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,860
At lunch Barbara, Walter and I sat together
in the cafeteria.

527
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,620
I had a lot of things to tell them.

528
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,750
"Well, guys, guess who's an alien?"

529
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,910
I said.

530
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,710
"Oh no!" said Walter.

531
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,440
"Not another alien, first it was Mr Wilkinson..."

532
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,390
"Is this a joke?" asked Barbara.

533
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,700
"No, listen to me, please!"

534
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,480
I whispered excitedly.

535
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,240
"Mr Kent is an alien!"

536
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,380
"WHAT!"

537
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,380
cried Walter.

538
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,000
"No, he's not!"

539
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,500
cried Barbara, who thought I was joking.

540
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
"Shh!

541
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Be quiet!"

542
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
I said.

543
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,240
Some of the other students turned around and
looked at us.

544
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,490
"Let me tell you what happened last night."

545
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,750
I told them everything about last night.

546
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,049
My friends were shocked but they believed
me.

547
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:34,460
They stopped eating their lunches.

548
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,940
"Do you remember the alien alert in August?"
asked Walter.

549
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,210
"All the newspapers were talking about it."

550
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:47,900
"Yeah," said Barbara, "some people saw a UFO
near the Cascade Mountains!"

551
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,720
"Then Mr Kent is one of the aliens from the
UFO!" said Walter.

552
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,799
"Do you remember how he looked at the sun
the first day of school?

553
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,070
And how the mice in the cages were afraid
of him?

554
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,070
Wow!"

555
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,549
"Aliens scare me," said Barbara.

556
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:06,720
"A teacher who's an alien at our school..."

557
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,750
"I don't think aliens are bad," said Walter.

558
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,270
"They're just different."

559
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:18,500
"Now listen," I said, "other aliens are coming
to the old airfield Friday night in their

560
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,730
spaceship.

561
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:25,100
They want to take Mr Kent and a student to
their planet, Mitrax.

562
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,760
They want to study humans."

563
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,290
"A student!"

564
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,290
cried Barbara.

565
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,350
"That's one of us!"

566
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,960
"We have to stop him!" said Walter.

567
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,220
"Are the aliens coming this Friday?" asked
Barbara.

568
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,980
"Yes, on the day of the PTA meeting," I said.

569
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,500
"And today is Thursday.

570
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,150
We only have one day to do something."

571
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,330
"I have an idea," said Walter.

572
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,490
"What is it?"

573
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,320
Barbara and I asked.

574
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:59,120
"We have to find the special X-5 spray and
take it away from Mr Kent," Walter said.

575
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,460
"Without it he can't take the student."

576
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,549
"Great idea!" said Barbara.

577
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:07,860
"The spray is probably in the science lab
or in his house."

578
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:13,380
"This afternoon when he goes home we can look
for the spray in the science lab," said Walter.

579
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,559
"But all the sprays and bottles are in locked
cupboards, and we don't have the key."

580
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,270
"Maybe my brother Matt can help us," said
Barbara.

581
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:27,510
"He's a policeman and he has a special key
that opens all doors."

582
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,290
"Can we use it?" asked Walter.

583
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:36,010
"Well, I can't tell him our story because
he'll never believe it," said Barbara.

584
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:40,450
"But sometimes he goes to work and leaves
the special key in his room.

585
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,540
I'll look for it and take it.

586
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,750
Then I'll put it back."

587
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,169
"Be careful, Barbara," I said.

588
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:49,650
"We don't want trouble with the police!"

589
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,740
We started laughing.

590
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:58,550
It was time to go back to our afternoon classes:
math and American history.

591
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,720
I was happy when school ended at half past
three.

592
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,540
Barbara and I went to her house and Walter
stayed at the school library.

593
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,060
When we got to Barbara's house no one was
home.

594
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,299
We went to Matt's room and looked for the
special key.

595
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:20,069
"I hope Matt didn't take the key with him,"
said Barbara.

596
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:24,460
She opened all the drawers and cupboards in
his room and looked for it.

597
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,639
"Here it is!"

598
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,829
she cried happily.

599
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:29,050
"It was at the back of his desk drawer."

600
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,889
"Oh, great!

601
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:34,730
Now let's go back to school," I said.

602
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:41,669
We went back to school quickly and called
Walter, who was still studying in the library.

603
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:46,639
It was almost five o'clock and there was no
one in school.

604
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,819
We went upstairs to the science lab.

605
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:53,319
The door of the lab was open and someone was
inside.

606
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:54,679
"Oh, no!

607
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:57,589
It's Mr Philips, the janitor," Walter whispered.

608
00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:01,180
"Let's hide in the bathroom!" said Barbara.

609
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,020
We hid in the bathroom for a few minutes.

610
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,710
Then we heard Mr Phillips go downstairs.

611
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:11,450
"OK, now we can go to the lab," said Walter.

612
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,700
We went inside the lab and looked around.

613
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:19,260
There was a big sign on each cupboard that
said, DANGER!

614
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,660
TOXIC CHEMICALS INSIDE!

615
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:27,130
We opened the two big ones and looked at every
bottle.

616
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,150
There weren't any spray cans.

617
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:35,269
Then we looked inside the smallest one and
found a small black spray can.

618
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:37,539
It didn't have a name.

619
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:41,220
"All the other bottles and cans have a name,"
said Walter.

620
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,030
"This must be Mr Kent's spray!"

621
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,490
He took it out of the small cupboard and said,
"It's very heavy."

622
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,999
"Who wants to take it home?"

623
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:51,059
I asked.

624
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:52,660
"Not me!" said Barbara.

625
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,430
"My mother always looks around in my room."

626
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,479
"Mine does too," I said.

627
00:35:57,479 --> 00:36:00,550
"Oh, I'll take it home," said Walter.

628
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,690
"A spray can from another planet...

629
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,059
I can study it!"

630
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:06,099
"Don't spray yourself with it!"

631
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,269
Barbara said laughing.

632
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:15,150
Walter, Barbara and I went home because we
had a lot of homework to do.

633
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,109
After dinner the phone rang and I answered
it.

634
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,670
"Hi, Karen," said Walter.

635
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,440
"Can you come to my house?

636
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,089
I have to talk to you."

637
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:26,969
"It's eight o'clock and I'm doing my homework,"
I said.

638
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:30,799
"Karen, please, this is important," Walter
said.

639
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:32,930
"Are you alright, Walter?"

640
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,049
I asked.

641
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:35,740
"You sound strange."

642
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,430
"Please come, Karen.

643
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,029
It's important."

644
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:43,140
"OK, I'll be there in fifteen minutes," I
said.

645
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:48,259
I quickly put on my jacket and ran downstairs
to the living room.

646
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:53,230
My mom was reading the newspaper and my dad
was watching TV.

647
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,150
Tex was sitting next to them.

648
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,420
"Mom, I'm taking Tex out for a walk."

649
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,739
"At eight o'clock at night?"

650
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:03,130
my mom asked, surprised.

651
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,130
"Yeah, I'm tired of studying," I said.

652
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:10,460
"I really need to take a walk and get some
fresh air.

653
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,499
I'll be back by nine o'clock."

654
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:15,849
"Some fresh air is good for you, Karen," said
my dad.

655
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:17,690
"It's a nice evening."

656
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,969
"See you later!"

657
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:21,210
I said.

658
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:25,099
Tex and I walked down the street and crossed
the park quickly.

659
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:28,910
What did Walter want at this time?

660
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,240
I wanted to find out.

661
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:39,549
It was a warm evening and there was a full
moon in the sky.

662
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,200
CHAPTER SIX

663
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,869
A Big Decision

664
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:48,369
Walter was waiting for me at the front door
of his beautiful house.

665
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:50,050
"Hi Karen!" he said.

666
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,670
"You can leave Tex outside in the garden.

667
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,109
Tootsie doesn't like dogs."

668
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:59,690
"I know, and Tex doesn't like cats either,"
I said laughing.

669
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,509
Walter was home alone and we went to his room
and sat down.

670
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:07,479
"Karen, I have some news for you," he said.

671
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:08,920
"News?

672
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
What news?"

673
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
I asked.

674
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,009
"I want to go to Mitrax with Mr Kent," said
Walter.

675
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:16,279
"WHAT!"

676
00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:17,279
I cried.

677
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:18,680
"Are you joking?"

678
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,720
"No, I'm not joking, Karen," he said.

679
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,500
"This is a great opportunity for me.

680
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,240
You know I want to become an astronaut.

681
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,170
A trip on a spaceship to another galaxy is
wonderful!

682
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:33,279
I can see Mitrax and the aliens who live there.

683
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:36,729
I can study them and see how they live and
what they eat.

684
00:38:36,729 --> 00:38:40,049
I can find out things that aren't written
in books.

685
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:44,680
This is a great scientific adventure and I'm
lucky I can go!

686
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,829
How many people have the opportunity to go
to and explore another planet?"

687
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,109
Walter was happy and excited.

688
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:55,489
"But... aren't you afraid of aliens?"

689
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:56,650
I asked.

690
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,529
"What will they do to you?"

691
00:38:58,529 --> 00:39:03,170
"I don't think Mr Kent and the other aliens
want to hurt me," said Walter.

692
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,740
"They just want to study me because I'm a
human.

693
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,440
I think I can trust them."

694
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,799
"When will you return to Earth?"

695
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:11,799
I asked.

696
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:15,849
"I don't know," he said, "but I want to return
to see you."

697
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:18,099
"Are you going to tell your dad?"

698
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:19,099
I asked.

699
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:22,390
"He's away on business for a few days," said
Walter.

700
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:25,969
"I'm going to write him a letter and explain
everything."

701
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:31,809
We talked for a long time and I began to understand
Walter's decision.

702
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:37,739
"I'll never see you again," I said and started
crying.

703
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:41,650
He took my hand and said, "Please don't cry,
Karen.

704
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,480
I'll come back and tell you amazing things."

705
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,940
We were silent for a few minutes.

706
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,869
"Please don't tell anyone except Barbara about
my decision," said Walter.

707
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:58,730
"I won't, it's our secret," I said.

708
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,630
"Here, take my school ring.

709
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:06,160
When you look at it, think of me," he said
giving it to me.

710
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,059
"I'll always think of you," I said quietly.

711
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:12,339
I put his ring on my finger.

712
00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:17,930
"Listen, Karen," said Walter, "we have to
make a plan for tomorrow evening.

713
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:22,979
When Mr Kent takes the student to the science
lab he won't find his spray.

714
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:27,969
So the student will run away and he will return
to his spaceship with no one.

715
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:31,150
He can't miss his spaceship because it will
leave without him.

716
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:36,109
I'll wait for him in the science lab tomorrow
evening and I'll tell him my decision."

717
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:40,630
"Good luck, Walter," I said.

718
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:46,089
Walter looked at Tootsie and said, "Can you
look after Tootsie when I go away?"

719
00:40:46,089 --> 00:40:51,700
"Well, there's Tex... but I can look after
your cat," I said.

720
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,769
"I've got a big garden."

721
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:57,839
"Thanks a lot, Karen," said Walter.

722
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:05,839
When I got home it was late and I immediately
went upstairs to bed, but I couldn't sleep.

723
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,789
On Friday morning I met Barbara and we walked
to school together.

724
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:13,849
I told her about Walter's decision.

725
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:18,789
She stopped in the middle of the street and
almost started crying.

726
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:22,509
Then she saw his school ring on my finger.

727
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:26,859
She smiled and said, "He likes you a lot."

728
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:32,500
At the end of the school day Walter, Barbara
and I went for an ice cream.

729
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,539
We sat around a small round table and ate
our ice cream quietly.

730
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:45,030
"This is the last time we can have ice cream
together," said Barbara sadly.

731
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,119
The PTA meeting started at seven o'clock.

732
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:54,769
First, the parents visited our classrooms
and talked to some of our teachers.

733
00:41:54,769 --> 00:42:00,019
At eight o'clock there was a big meeting in
the gym with the principal.

734
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:06,349
She was explaining about all the plans for
the school over the next year.

735
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:12,079
At about a quarter past eight Mr Kent got
up from his chair and went to see Barbara's

736
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,729
family.

737
00:42:13,729 --> 00:42:17,869
He whispered something to them and then to
Barbara.

738
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,339
She was his choice.

739
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:23,049
She got up and followed him.

740
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:27,209
She wasn't worried because she knew Walter
was waiting in the science lab.

741
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:31,989
They left the gym and went upstairs.

742
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:34,160
I decided to follow them.

743
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,170
"Karen, where are you going?"

744
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,540
whispered my dad.

745
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:45,400
"Oh, I'm just going to the science lab for
a minute".

746
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,309
CHAPTER SEVEN

747
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:51,200
The Old Airfield

748
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,729
When I got to the science lab I slowly opened
the door and looked inside.

749
00:42:57,729 --> 00:43:00,640
Barbara was standing near the table.

750
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:08,160
Mr Kent took out his key and opened the small
cupboard, but he could not find his X-5 spray.

751
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,880
"Oh, no!" he said angrily.

752
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,039
"Where is it?"

753
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:18,390
I heard Walter say, "What are you looking
for, Mr Kent?"

754
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,029
"Walter, what are you doing here?"

755
00:43:21,029 --> 00:43:22,599
asked Mr Kent surprised.

756
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:29,239
"Are you looking for your X-5 spray, Klyreg?"
asked Walter calmly.

757
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,450
"How...

758
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:35,660
how do you know my name and about the spray?"
asked Mr Kent nervously.

759
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,619
"We know everything about you," said Barbara.

760
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:47,250
"Yes, we know who you are and why you're here,"
I said.

761
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,209
I walked into the lab and closed the door.

762
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:56,150
Mr Kent was very surprised and looked inside
the small cupboard again.

763
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:02,569
"We know about your plan and I want to go
to Mitrax with you," said Walter, looking

764
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:04,960
at Mr Kent in the eyes.

765
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,099
"Leave Barbara here and take me with you.

766
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:09,309
You can study me.

767
00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:12,109
I'm not afraid, I know you won't hurt me."

768
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:17,930
"You want to come to Mitrax with me?" asked
Mr Kent, who was shocked.

769
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,109
"Yes, I do!" said Walter.

770
00:44:20,109 --> 00:44:23,390
"I want to find out about life on other planets."

771
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:28,009
"That's a very brave decision," said Mr Kent.

772
00:44:28,009 --> 00:44:32,970
"Mitrax is in another galaxy and it's very
different to Earth.

773
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:33,970
Are you sure?"

774
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:36,410
"Yes, I'm sure," said Walter.

775
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,630
"It will be a great experience."

776
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:43,509
"Mr Kent, can I ask you what Mitrax is like?"

777
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:44,940
I asked.

778
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,219
I wanted to know something about where Walter
was going.

779
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:52,069
"Yes, Karen, you can," he answered.

780
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:55,890
"Mitrax is a small planet, about half the
size of Earth.

781
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:00,680
There are no buildings and we all live in
spaceships.

782
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,489
Our technology is much more advanced, Walter
will have a lot of fun discovering all the

783
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:06,880
new things."

784
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,980
It sounded interesting.

785
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:14,619
I looked at my watch and said sadly, "It's
almost nine o'clock.

786
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:17,849
You're going to miss your spaceship.

787
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:20,400
Goodbye Walter and good luck."

788
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,599
"One day I'll come back!" said Walter looking
at me.

789
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:30,880
Mr Kent walked towards the door and Walter
followed him.

790
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,150
"Yes, goodbye and good luck, Walter," said
Barbara.

791
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,300
Mr Kent looked at us and smiled.

792
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:45,210
I thought about the green face and the red
eyes under the mask - I could not believe

793
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,619
what was happening.

794
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:53,059
"You humans are... interesting," said Mr Kent.

795
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:59,450
"Walter, let's go, we have to get to the airfield
before half past nine."

796
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:03,390
Then they ran down the stairs and left the
school.

797
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:07,069
I looked at Barbara and said, "Let's follow
them!

798
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:10,849
We can see the spaceship and perhaps a few
aliens!"

799
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:15,069
"Yeah, let's go!" said Barbara.

800
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:17,589
There was no one at the old airfield.

801
00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:22,190
The spaceship was there, but the lights were
off.

802
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:25,210
It was gray and round.

803
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:29,239
Mr Kent and Walter were standing in front
of it.

804
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:32,749
Suddenly the lights came on and a door opened.

805
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:36,849
A tall alien came to the door.

806
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:43,630
He said something to Mr Kent in a strange
language and then another strange voice said,

807
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:46,890
"The spaceship is leaving in one minute."

808
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,119
Walter turned around and said, "Goodbye, Karen.

809
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,250
Goodbye Barbara."

810
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,069
"Have fun on Mitrax!"

811
00:46:54,069 --> 00:46:59,369
I said laughing and crying at the same time.

812
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:05,160
Walter and Mr Kent went inside the spaceship
and the door closed suddenly.

813
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:13,019
The spaceship lights turned on and it immediately
went up into the night sky silently.

814
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:15,930
Barbara and I watched it until it disappeared.

815
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:20,190
Then we went back to the meeting at school.

816
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:24,380
Barbara went to sit with her parents and I
went to sit with mine.

817
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,089
"Is everything alright, Karen?"

818
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:28,269
my mom asked.

819
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:29,719
"Of course!"

820
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:30,719
I said.

821
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:33,849
"This is a very interesting meeting," said
my dad.

822
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:38,160
"When it's over we're invited to coffee and
cake in the cafeteria."

823
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:46,549
"Oh, OK," I said, but I wasn't interested:
I was thinking about Walter, Mr Kent, the

824
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:49,910
spaceship and Mitrax.

825
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,779
Barbara looked at me and smiled.

826
00:47:51,779 --> 00:47:57,299
She was the only one who could understand
how I felt that evening.

827
00:47:57,299 --> 00:47:58,449
Six months later...

828
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:05,609
The day after the PTA meeting Barbara and
I told everyone the truth about Mr Kent and

829
00:48:05,609 --> 00:48:07,170
Walter.

830
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:12,549
The news was on the front pages of every American
and foreign newspaper.

831
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:19,199
There were hundreds of articles about the
UFO, Mr Kent, Walter and Mitrax.

832
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,710
Journalists came to our school and interviewed
us.

833
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:27,569
They took pictures of us and the old airfield.

834
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:34,259
TV stations from all over the world also came
to film Washington High School.

835
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:38,039
The news was on television for weeks.

836
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:41,900
Then things slowly started to get back to
normal.

837
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,319
At school we now have a new science teacher.

838
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:51,989
Her name is Miss Lundberg, and I don't think
she's an alien... but who knows!

839
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:57,279
Mr Wilkinson is feeling better and he often
smiles and laughs.

840
00:48:57,279 --> 00:49:02,299
He's starting to eat a big lunch in the cafeteria
like everyone else.

841
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:07,880
We all like his English class because he is
an excellent teacher.

842
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,789
He'll be our English teacher next year too.

843
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:15,599
Tootsie now lives with us and she's happy.

844
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:22,740
She and Tex fought a lot in the beginning
but now they're friends and they play together.

845
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:30,890
Barbara and I often talk about Walter, Mr
Kent, the spaceship and our great adventure.

846
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:37,880
Some evenings I sit in the garden, look at
Walter's ring and look up at the sky.

847
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,920
I think of him on Mitrax.

848
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,920
"Good night, Walter, wherever you are.

849
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,759
I hope to see you soon."

850
00:49:46,759 --> 00:49:46,779
- THE END -
