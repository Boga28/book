1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,200
The West of Ireland, with its rivers full 
of salmon, is a grand place to go fishing.  

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,240
Sinclair Yeates has been trying to catch 
salmon for three days, but without success.  

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,360
He starts his journey home, travelling by train,  

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,160
which in the early years of the twentieth century 
is an experience full of interest and surprises...

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,400
People say there is no smoke without fire.  

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,520
But that was not true in the station 
waiting-room where I had to wait for my train.  

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,560
There was certainly plenty of smoke 
but the fire seemed quite dead.

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,680
When I complained to the stationmaster, he said 
that any chimney in the world would smoke in a  

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,520
south-easterly wind. He was, however, sympathetic, 
and took me to his own fire in his office,  

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,040
where the steam rose in clouds from my wet boots. 
We talked of politics and salmon-fishing, and  

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,320
I had to confess that on my three-day 
trip I had not caught a single fish.

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,320
Before the signal for my train was received, I 
realized for the hundredth time the wonderful  

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,320
individuality of the Irish mind and the 
importance of the 'personal element' in Ireland.  

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,360
If you ask people for help, they will break rules,  

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,200
ignore official advice, make special 
arrangements - all just to please you.

16
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,880
I found a seat in a carriage, and the train 
dragged itself noisily out of the station.  

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,760
A cold spring rain - the time was the middle 
of a most unseasonal April - poured down  

18
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:57,360
as we came into the open. I closed both windows 
and began to read my wife's letter again.  

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,320
Philippa often says I do not read her letters, 
and as I was now on my way to join her and  

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,160
my family in England, it seemed sensible to 
study again her latest letter of instructions.

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,960
'Such bad luck that you haven't caught any 
salmon. If the worst comes to the worst,  

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,080
and you still haven't by the time 
you join us, couldn't you buy one?'

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,400
I hit my knee with my hand. I had forgotten about 
the damn fish! Philippa would say, 'Sinclair,  

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,760
I was right! You don't read my letters, do you!'  

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,160
It's a pity she never learns from these frequent 
experiences; I don't mind being called a fool,  

26
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,640
but then I should be allowed to forget things, as 
fools do. Without doubt, Philippa had written to  

27
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,600
Alice Hervey, whose house we were staying in for 
the next week, and told her that Sinclair would  

28
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:00,000
be only too delighted to bring her a salmon. And 
Alice Hervey, who was rich enough to find much  

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,440
enjoyment in saving money, would have already 
planned the meal down to the last fish bone.

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:15,120
Anxiously thinking about this, I travelled through 
the rain. About every six miles we stopped at  

31
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,920
a station. At one, the only event was that the 
stationmaster presented a newspaper to the guard;  

32
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,400
at the next, the guard read aloud some 
interesting facts from it to the driver.  

33
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,040
The personal element was strong on this line 
of the Munster and Connaught Railway. Routine,  

34
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,480
hated by all artistic minds, 
was disguised by conversation.

35
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,640
According to the timetable, we were supposed 
to spend ten minutes at Carrig station,  

36
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,360
but it was fifteen before all the market people 
on the platform had climbed onto the train.  

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,320
Finally, the window of the carriage next to mine 
was thrown open, and an angry English voice asked  

38
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,800
how much longer the train was going to wait. The 
stationmaster, who was deep in conversation with  

39
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,280
the guard and a man carrying a long parcel wrapped 
in newspaper, looked round and said seriously.

40
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,640
'Well now, that's a mystery!'

41
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,280
The man with the parcel turned away and studied 
an advertisement, his shoulders shaking.  

42
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,640
The guard put his hand over his mouth.

43
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,560
The voice, even angrier now, demanded the 
earliest time its owner could get to Belfast.

44
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,440
'Ye'll be asking me next when I take me 
breakfast,' replied the stationmaster calmly.

45
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
The window closed with a bang, 
and the man on the platform  

46
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
dropped his parcel, which fell to the ground.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,160
'Oh! Me fish!' cried the man, carefully picking up  

48
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,000
a remarkably handsome salmon that 
had slipped out of its wrapping.

49
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,160
Suddenly I had a bright idea. I opened my 
window and called to the stationmaster.

50
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,160
'Excuse me, would your 
friend sell me that salmon?'

51
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,920
There was a moment's lively discussion, and the 
stationmaster replied, 'I'm sorry, sir, he's only  

52
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,040
just bought it, in this little delay we have. But 
why don't ye run down and get one for yourself?  

53
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,200
There are six or seven of them down at Coffey's, 
selling cheap. There'll be time enough. We're  

54
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,160
waiting for the mail train to pass through in the 
other direction, and it hasn't been signaled yet.'

55
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,480
I jumped from the carriage and ran 
out of the station at top speed,  

56
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,360
followed by a shout from the guard that he 
wouldn't forget me. Congratulating myself  

57
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,520
on the influence of the personal 
element, I hurried through the town.  

58
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,240
On my way I met a red-faced, heated man carrying 
another salmon, who informed me there were still  

59
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,560
three or four fish at Coffey's, and that 
he was running for the train himself.

60
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,680
'Coffey's is the house with 
the boots in the window!'  

61
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,160
he called after me. 'She'll sell at ten 
pence a pound if ye're stiff with her!'

62
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,640
'Ten pence a pound,' I thought, 'at 
this time of year! That's good enough.'

63
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,320
I saw the boots in the window, 
and rushed through a dark doorway.  

64
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,440
At that moment I heard, horrifyingly near, 
the whistle of the approaching mail train.  

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,880
The fat woman who appeared from a back 
room understood the situation at once,  

66
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,040
and in one rapid movement picked up a large fish 
from the floor and threw a newspaper round it.

67
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,520
'Weighs eight pounds!' she said. 'Ten shillings!'

68
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,080
I realized she was charging more than ten 
pence a pound, but this was not the moment for  

69
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,840
stiffness. I pushed the coins into her fishy 
hand, took the salmon in my arms, and ran.

70
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,920
Needless to say, it was uphill, and at the 
steepest point I heard another whistle, and feared  

71
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:07,360
that the worst had happened. When I reached the 
platform, my train was already out of the station,  

72
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,600
but the personal element was still working for me. 
Everybody in the station, or so it seemed to me,  

73
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,400
shouted loudly to the driver. The stationmaster 
put his fingers in his mouth and sent an  

74
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,200
unearthly whistle after the departing 
train. It took effect; the train slowed.  

75
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,960
I jumped from the platform and followed it along 
the rails; there were passengers' heads at all  

76
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,200
the windows, watching me with deep interest. The 
guard bent down and helped me up onto the train.

77
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,840
'Sorry, sir, the English gentleman going to 
Belfast wouldn't let me wait any longer,'  

78
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,920
he said apologetically.

79
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,200
From Carrig station came a delighted 
cry from the stationmaster:  

80
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,400
'Ye told him ye wouldn't forget him!'

81
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,240
My very public return to my seat 
was greeted with great sympathy  

82
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,600
by the seven countrywomen who were now in 
my carriage. I was hot and out of breath,  

83
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:14,880
and the eyes of the seven women were fixed on me 
with deep and untiring interest. After a while  

84
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,200
one of them opened the conversation by 
supposing it was at Coffey's I got the salmon.

85
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,800
I said it was.

86
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,680
There was a silence, during which it was 
obvious that one question burnt in every heart.

87
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,880
'She's sure to have asked for 
ten pence!' said one woman.

88
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,720
'It's a beautiful fish!' I said bravely. 'Eight 
pounds weight. I gave her ten shillings for it.'

89
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,120
This confession produced a 
wave of shock and sympathy.

90
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,200
'Sure, and Eliza Coffey would rob her own mother!'

91
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,840
'How could an honest gentleman 
win a battle with her!'

92
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,000
'Eliza Coffey never paid a 
penny for that fish! Those  

93
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,640
boys of hers stole a whole 
lot of them last night.'

94
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,440
At the next station they climbed out. I helped 
them with their heavy baskets, and in return  

95
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,960
they told me I was a fine man, and they wished 
me well on my journey. They also left me with the  

96
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,440
information that I was soon to present the highly 
respectable Alice Hervey with a stolen salmon.

97
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,920
The afternoon passed cheerlessly into evening, 
and my journey did not get any better.  

98
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:40,000
Somewhere in the grey half-light I changed trains, 
and again later on, and at each change the salmon  

99
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,400
lost some of its newspaper wrapping. I wondered 
seriously whether to bury it in my suitcase.  

100
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,560
At the next station we paused for a long time.  

101
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,240
Nothing at all happened, and the rain 
beat patiently on the carriage roof.  

102
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,840
I closed my eyes to avoid the cold 
stare of the salmon, and fell asleep.

103
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:12,560
I woke up in total darkness. The train was not 
moving, and there was complete silence. I could  

104
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:20,560
see a lamp at the far end of a platform, so I knew 
we were at a station. I lit a match and discovered  

105
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,400
from my watch that it was eleven o'clock, exactly 
the time I was supposed to board the mail train.  

106
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,400
I jumped down and ran along the platform. There 
was no one on the train; there was no one even  

107
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,800
in the engine, which was making sad 
little noises to itself in the silence.  

108
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:46,720
There was not a human being anywhere. The name 
of the station was just visible in the darkness.  

109
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,680
With a lighted match I went along it letter 
by letter, but it was so long that by the  

110
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,840
time I got to the end, I had forgotten the 
beginning. One thing I did realize, though,  

111
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,800
was that it was not Loughranny, the station 
where I had planned to catch the mail train.

112
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,800
For a moment I had the feeling 
that there had been an accident,  

113
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:19,920
and that I now existed in another world. Once more 
I investigated the station - the ticket office,  

114
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:28,320
the waiting room - and finally discovered, at some 
distance, the stationmaster's office. As I came  

115
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,880
closer, I could see a thin line of light under 
the door, and a voice was suddenly raised inside.

116
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,160
'Let's see ye beat that. Throw down your King!'

117
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,440
I opened the door with understandable violence, 
and found the guard, the stationmaster,  

118
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,480
the driver, and his assistant seated 
around a table, playing a game of cards.

119
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,560
I was angry, and with good reason, but I 
accepted what they said in their defense:  

120
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,920
they thought there was no one left on the train, 
a few minutes here or there wouldn't matter,  

121
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,920
they would soon get me to Loughranny, 
and the mail train was often late.

122
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,560
Hoping they were right about my 
chances of making the connection,  

123
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,840
I hurried back to my carriage, with the 
officials running enthusiastically ahead of me.

124
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,920
'Watch out for the goods train, Tim!' 
shouted the station-master to the driver,  

125
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,400
as he banged my door shut. 'She 
might be coming any time now!'

126
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,800
The answer travelled back proudly from the engine.

127
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,080
'Let her come! She'll have us to deal with!'

128
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,840
The train moved forward and gained speed 
rapidly. We had about fifteen miles to go,  

129
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,080
and we went as fast as the engine could manage. 
But it was no good - we arrived too late.

130
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,960
'Well,' said the guard, as I stepped onto 
the deserted platform of Loughranny station,  

131
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,080
'that old mail is the most unpunctual 
train in Ireland! If ye're a minute late,  

132
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,280
she's gone, and maybe if ye were early, 
ye'd be half an hour waiting for her!'

133
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,400
On the whole, the guard did his best. He 
said he would show me the best hotel in town,  

134
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:22,160
although he feared it would be hard to get a bed 
anywhere because of the Feis. A Feis, it seems,  

135
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,200
is a festival of Irish songs and dances, where 
people compete for prizes. He picked up my case,  

136
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,960
he even carried the salmon, and as 
we walked through the empty streets,  

137
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,560
he explained to me how easily I could 
catch the morning boat from Rosslare,  

138
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,040
and how it was, in fact, quite an 
improvement on my previous plan.

139
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,960
All was dark at the uninviting door 
of the hotel chosen by the guard.  

140
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:53,280
For five whole minutes we rang the bell 
hard. I suggested trying a different hotel.

141
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,840
'He'll come,' said the guard confidently. 
'He'll come. It rings in his room, so it does.'

142
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,480
A boy, half awake, half dressed, opened the door.  

143
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,640
'There's not a bed here,' he said, 
yawning, 'nor anywhere in the town either.'

144
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
'I'll sit in the dining room till the 
time for the early train,' I said.

145
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,600
'To be sure, there's five beds in the dining 
room,' he replied, 'and there's mostly two  

146
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,440
people in every bed.' His voice was firm, 
but he had a hesitating look in his eye.

147
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,040
'What about the billiard room, 
Mike?' said the guard helpfully.

148
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,560
'We have blankets on the 
billiard table at this minute,  

149
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,240
and the man that won first prize 
for reels asleep on top of it!'

150
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,760
'Well, can't ye put some blankets on 
the floor under it?' said the guard,  

151
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,440
putting my case and the salmon in the hall. 
'To be sure, there's no better place in the  

152
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,720
house! Now I must go home, before 
me wife thinks I'm dead and buried!'

153
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,760
His footsteps went lightly 
away down the empty street.

154
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,240
'Nothing troubles him!' said the boy bitterly.

155
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,520
And I realized that only the 
personal element stood between me  

156
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,520
and a sleepless night on a 
cold, wet station platform.

157
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,840
It was in the dark of the early morning that I 
woke again to life and its troubles. A voice had  

158
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:34,240
woken me, the voice of the first prize for reels, 
descending through a pocket of the billiard table.

159
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,240
'Excuse me, sir, are ye going 
on the 5 o'clock train to Cork?'

160
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,480
'No,' I said crossly.

161
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,760
'Well, if ye were, ye'd be late,' said the voice.

162
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,640
I received this useful information in annoyed  

163
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,640
silence, and tried to wrap 
myself in a disappearing dream.

164
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,920
'I'm going on the 6.30 me 
self,' continued the voice,  

165
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,200
'and it's unknown to me how I'll put on 
me boots. Ye would not believe how me feet  

166
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,920
swelled up in me dancing shoes last night. 
Me feet are delicate like that, ye see.'

167
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:17,280
I pretended to be asleep, but the dream was 
gone. And so was any chance of further sleep.

168
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,160
The first prize for reels got 
down from the billiard table,  

169
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,360
presenting an extraordinary picture. He was 
wearing grass-green breeches, a white shirt,  

170
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,160
and pearl-grey stockings. He undressed, 
and put on ordinary clothes, including  

171
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,880
his painful boots. He then removed 
himself and his things to the hall,  

172
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,880
where he had a loud conversation with the boy. 
Meanwhile, I crawled out of my hiding-place to  

173
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,200
renew my struggle with life. Fortunately, 
the boy soon appeared with a cup of tea.

174
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,560
'I've wrapped the salmon up in brown paper 
for ye, sir,' he said cheerfully. 'It's  

175
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,320
safe to take across Europe with ye if ye 
like! I'll just run up to the station now,  

176
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,920
with the luggage. Would ye mind carrying the 
fish yourself? It's on the table in the hall.'  

177
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,320
My train went at 6.15. The boy had put my 
case in one of the many empty carriages,  

178
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,040
and stayed with me, making pleasant 
conversation, until the train departed.

179
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,720
'I'm sorry ye had a bad night, sir,' he said, 
'and I must tell ye, it was only that Jimmy  

180
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,040
Durkan - he's the first prize for reels, sir 
- had taken a few drinks. If he'd been sober,  

181
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,720
I'd have put a gentleman like ye on the billiard 
table instead of him. He's a baker, ye know,  

182
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,600
in the town of Limerick. And he's engaged to my 
sister. Well, any girl would be glad to marry him.  

183
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,880
He dances with a beautiful straight back, and 
he makes grand bread!' Here the train started.

184
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:06,160
It was late that night when, stiff, dirty, 
with tired eyes blinded by the bright lights,  

185
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:13,200
I was taken by the Herveys' well-trained doorman 
into the Herveys' huge grand hall, and was told  

186
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:21,360
by another of the Herveys' beautifully dressed 
servants that dinner was over. I was just hoping  

187
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:28,480
I could go quietly upstairs to avoid meeting 
anyone, when a voice cried, 'Here he is!'

188
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,920
And Philippa, looking lovely in evening dress,  

189
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:40,720
came into the hall, followed by Alice Hervey, 
and my niece, whose wedding party this was,  

190
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,800
and by all the usual relations who hate to 
miss anything that's going on before a wedding.

191
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,320
'Is this a wedding present 
for me, Uncle Sinclair?'  

192
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,440
cried the future bride, in the middle 
of a flood of questions and sympathy.

193
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,480
As she spoke, she eagerly took hold of the 
brown-paper parcel that was still under my arm.

194
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,840
'I advise you not to open 
it!' I cried. 'It's a salmon!'

195
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,200
The future bride gave a little scream of distaste,  

196
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,240
and without a moment's hesitation, threw it at 
her best friend, a girl standing near her. The  

197
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:29,120
best friend gave an answering scream, and jumped 
to one side. The parcel that I had looked after  

198
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,520
with a mother's care across two countries and a 
stormy sea fell with a crash on the stone floor.

199
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,480
Why did it crash?

200
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:47,920
'A salmon!' cried Philippa, staring at the 
parcel. There was now a small pool around it,  

201
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,480
spreading over the floor. 'But 
that's whiskey! Can't you smell it?'

202
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,640
The servant came respectfully forward. He 
knelt down, and cautiously picked pieces  

203
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,960
of a broken glass bottle out of the brown 
paper. The smell of whiskey became stronger.

204
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,560
'I'm afraid the other things are ruined, sir,' 
he said seriously, and pulled out of the parcel,  

205
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,560
one after the other, a very 
large pair of dancing shoes,  

206
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,800
two long grey stockings, and a 
pair of grass-green breeches.

207
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,320
They were greeted with wild enthusiasm, in 
doubtless much the same way as when they  

208
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,240
shared the success of Mr Jimmy Durkan at 
the Feis, but Alice Hervey was not amused.

209
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,320
'You know, dear,' she said to Philippa 
afterwards, 'I don't think it was very clever  

210
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:52,000
of dear Sinclair to take the wrong 
parcel. I had wanted that salmon.'
 
 
 
 

211
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,553
- THE END -
