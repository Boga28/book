CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:06,609
A band on a guitar
Before I was born, my mum played music with

3
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:07,899
four friends.

4
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:11,240
There's a photograph of them in our living
room.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,420
Evie, Grace, Angela, Kate and my mum.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,130
They were the Sweet Pepper Band, and they
played South American music.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,430
Mum played guitar.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,030
Mum had long dark hair.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:30,120
In the photograph she's wearing a big hat,
a red shire and yellow trousers.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,100
She looks South American, but she's not, she's
English.

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,780
She's smiling in the photograph.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,989
She looks beautiful.

13
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:40,350
She's beautiful now too.

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,320
But these days her hair is short and the dark
brown colour comes from a bottle.

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,770
Mum doesn't play her guitar very often any
more.

16
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,760
It sits in the corner of the living room waiting
for Evie, Grace, Angela or Kate to visit.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,620
When I was a little girl, I liked to put my
small hand on the front of Mums guitar while

18
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,809
she played if.

19
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,830
My hand moved a little because of the music.

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,790
Mum said that was called vibration.

21
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,020
She was happy that I could feel the vibration
of her music when I put my hand on her guitar.

22
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,890
And she wasn't angry when one day I had blue
paint on my hand and I put it on the guitar.

23
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,890
Mum liked me to feel the vibration of her
music, you see.

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,710
That's because I can't hear her music.

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,840
My ears don't work.

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
I'm deaf.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,120
I was born like that.

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,970
Sometimes I think that's why Mum doesn't play
music very often because she knows I can't

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,090
hear it.

30
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,480
And now that I'm eighteen years old, my hands
are too big to put them on the front of the

31
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
guitar.

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,070
I don't know if Mum was sad to have a deaf
baby.

33
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,450
She tells me I was beautiful when I was born.

34
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,720
I had lots of blonde hair and blue eyes that
went brown like hers after a few months.

35
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,910
But I don't think Mums sad because she smiles
all the time.

36
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,680
Mum smiles more than anyone I know.

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,520
She's always happy, that's one of the things
everyone loves about her.

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,769
The children at Busy Kids Day Nursery, where
we both work, all love Mum.

39
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:15,030
Busy Kids is Mum's business.

40
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,890
She started it five years ago.

41
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,750
Mum's really good with children.

42
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,519
I remember when I was quite young - five or
six years old - I was sad about something.

43
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,870
I don't remember what I was sad about, but
I do remember what Mum said.

44
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:34,300
We sat in a chair together with her face close
to mine and she put her arms around me.

45
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:40,349
We stayed like that for a while, and then
she sat back so she could talk to me.

46
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:43,510
Mum and I use our hands and fingers to talk
to each other.

47
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,930
It's called signing.

48
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,829
Anyway, Mum said that we can choose how to
be in life - happy or sad.

49
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:54,019
She said, 'Life's short, so choose to be happy.

50
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,409
I try never to forger those words.

51
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,639
I try to be like my mum because I think she's
a wonderful person.

52
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,950
I don't know much about my father because
he left after I was born.

53
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,209
All I know is that he played music too, and
that he's French.

54
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,770
He lives in Paris now.

55
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,920
Mum and my father met when he was working
in Norwich for a year.

56
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,859
They fell in love and soon got married.

57
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:23,160
Dad moved into the house where Mum and I live
now.

58
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,980
Norwich is a beautiful place, but it isn't
as big and exciting as Paris.

59
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,310
I think my father got bored.

60
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,870
Or perhaps he was sad when I was born deaf.

61
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,790
Because that's when he went away to live with
his family in Paris.

62
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,090
He never came back.

63
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,109
Some of my friends don't talk to their parents
very much.

64
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:50,459
My friend Suzanne sometimes tells her mother
she's with me when she's really with her boyfriend.

65
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,379
She does this because her mum worries about
her all the time.

66
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:57,159
She worries about where she is and who she's
with.

67
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:02,260
But Mum and I are very close, and I couldn't
tell her something that wasn't true.

68
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,469
Anyway, she doesn't worry the way Suzanne's
mum does, so I usually tell her everything.

69
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:11,040
But I didn't tell her when I fell in love
for the first time.

70
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
I don't know why.

71
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,639
Perhaps it was because it felt so strange;
because I felt so strange.

72
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,560
It was almost like being on a boat on an angry
sea.

73
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,270
Sometimes I was afraid of how I felt.

74
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,300
And there was another problem.

75
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,530
I didn't know the name of the man I was in
love with.

76
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,599
CHAPTER TWO
Shopping

77
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:39,060
Just for a moment, try to think what it's
like to live in my world.

78
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,470
Stop what you're doing and put your hands
over your ears.

79
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,770
Are there no sounds at all?

80
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,910
Or are the noises of the street just quieter
than usual?

81
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,780
I know Mum loves listening to the sounds of
birds singing in the countryside when we go

82
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,780
walking.

83
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,360
In my world there are no birds singing.

84
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,980
There are no noisy men working on the roads.

85
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,590
No people leaving bars late at night shouting
at each other.

86
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,659
No babies crying.

87
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:09,840
But the man I love doesn't live in my world.

88
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,409
He lives in the hearing world.

89
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:17,300
The first time I saw him, he was standing
in front of the shop across the road from

90
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
our house.

91
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,330
He was putting apples and oranges onto the
table outside the shop and his black hair

92
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,720
had blue lights in it from the sun.

93
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,440
I watched him from my bedroom window, and
I smiled at how carefully he was putting the

94
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,620
fruit onto the table.

95
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,530
He was like an artist, not a shop assistant.

96
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,350
Then, as I watched, a big motorbike went up
the street.

97
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,840
The young man looked up and smiled as he watched
it go past.

98
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,720
I saw the motorbike go past, but he heard
it first, then saw it.

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,360
After the motorbike was gone, he went back
to his fruit.

100
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,680
But then a small girl fell off her bicycle
close to the shop and he ran to help her.

101
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,819
He knew she wanted help because he heard her.

102
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:05,639
In only one minute, I already knew four things
about him.

103
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,220
He had beautiful black hair.

104
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,110
He liked motorbikes.

105
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,910
He was kind to apples, oranges and little
girls.

106
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,229
And, of course, he could hear.

107
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,650
Until I first saw him, I didn't think very
often about being deaf.

108
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,050
It's all I've ever known, and I can't do anything
to change it.

109
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,750
And all my boyfriends have been deaf.

110
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,240
But after I saw the young man, I wanted to
be like most other people.

111
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,020
I didn't want to be different.

112
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,240
I soon found out that he only worked at the
shop on Saturdays.

113
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,280
After that I went in there to buy something
each Saturday.

114
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,470
Every week I wanted to talk to him, but every
week I just smiled and paid for my things.

115
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,479
Things that I didn't really want.

116
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,599
Mum often looked at me strangely when I came
back from the shop.

117
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,669
'We didn't need any apples, Samantha,' she
said once.

118
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,389
'I bought some yesterday.'

119
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:05,599
And another time, 'We've already got biscuits
in the cupboard.'

120
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,030
On Saturdays I always wanted to go to the
shop, but I always felt afraid too.

121
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,830
I never felt very comfortable as I walked
across the road.

122
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,620
I played with the money in my pocket like
a child going to buy sweets.

123
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,379
And then sometimes when I got to the shop
I waited for a moment outside, reading the

124
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:25,060
postcards in the window.

125
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,669
People who want to sell things write about
them on a postcard and the young man puts

126
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:32,550
them in the window: 'Car, five years old.

127
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,919
Cat needs good home, large fridge, nearly
new.'

128
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:42,210
One Saturday I read all of the postcards twice
before I went into the shop.

129
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,430
Then, when I was inside, I didn't know what
to buy.

130
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,580
Mum and I always go to the supermarket on
Fridays and I really didn't want anything.

131
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,210
The young man was busy selling bread and cakes
to a woman with two children.

132
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,120
This gave me time to think, and in the end
I decided to buy a newspaper.

133
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,160
The shop was often very busy on Saturdays.

134
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,819
Usually the young man just had time to smile
at me and take my money.

135
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,499
But that morning it was different.

136
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:15,259
After the woman and her children left, the
shop was empty.

137
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:18,219
There was only me and the young man.

138
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:21,830
When I took my newspaper to him to pay for
it, he smiled.

139
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,349
But when I tried to smile back at him, my
mouth felt like wood.

140
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:29,039
Then he said something to me.

141
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,169
I watched his mouth closely.

142
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:36,329
We had lessons at school to help us lip-read
- to watch people's mouths to read their words

143
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:37,470
when they talk.

144
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,840
I can lip-read quite well.

145
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,540
So I watched the young man's mouth and I thought
he was talking about a fire.

146
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,339
A big fire.

147
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:51,330
Then I looked down at my newspaper and saw
a picture of a house on fire.

148
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,170
It was a colour picture, and the fire was
very big and red.

149
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,410
I hoped nobody was in the house.

150
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,899
That's what I wanted to say to the young man:
'How terrible!

151
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:05,060
I hope nobody was in the house.'

152
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,279
But I didn't say it.

153
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,050
I didn't say anything.

154
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,500
I don't like speaking, you see.

155
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,050
I don't like actually using my voice.

156
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,970
When I was a child I often tried to talk and
other children didn't understand me.

157
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,970
Sometimes they laughed.

158
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,020
That's why I think my voice sounds strange.

159
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,339
And I didn't want the young man to think I
was strange.

160
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:32,060
When I looked up, the young man was speaking
again.

161
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,850
Then he wailed for me to answer him.

162
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,410
But I didn't hear him, so I couldn't.

163
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,590
So I just smiled and took my newspaper and
left the shop.

164
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:46,930
But as I walked across the road to my house,
I felt sad because I was sure he probably

165
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,550
did think I was strange now.

166
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,170
CHAPTER THREE
My best friend

167
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,670
Mum looked at me when I went into the house
with the newspaper.

168
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,540
We signed to each other.

169
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:03,560
'Are you OK?' she asked, and I did my best
to smile.

170
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,130
'Yes, I'm OK,' I said.

171
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,100
She looked at me for a moment as if she didn't
quite believe me, and then she said, 'Ron's

172
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
here.

173
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,980
He's in the living room.'

174
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,100
That made me happy again.

175
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,740
Ron is my very best friend.

176
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,339
We lived next door to each other when we were
children.

177
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:27,839
Now he's a student in London, and I don't
get to see him very often.

178
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,529
He's studying to be a teacher of deaf children.

179
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:35,180
He wanted to become one because of me.

180
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,880
Ron learnt to speak to me by signing when
he was very young.

181
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,880
I went quickly into the living room.

182
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,339
Ron was sitting on the sofa reading a magazine.

183
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:48,130
When he saw me he put the magazine down.

184
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,470
'Hi, Sam!' he signed to me and smiled.

185
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,630
'Hi, Ron.'

186
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,180
I smiled back and kissed him.

187
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,870
'How are you?'

188
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,450
I was really happy to see him.

189
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,550
I knew I could tell him about my problem with
the man from the shop.

190
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,139
Ron understood these things.

191
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:10,040
I remember the first time he fell in love.

192
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,550
It was with my friend Suzanne, actually.

193
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,959
Mum put her head round the door.

194
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,690
I watched her mouth move as she asked Ron
if he wanted a cup of tea.

195
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,529
She likes Ron as much as I do.

196
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:27,970
When we were children, she often took both
of us to the sea for the day.

197
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,430
Once I asked Ron what the sound of the sea
was like.

198
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,430
He said.

199
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,000
The sea's loud when it gets to the beach.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,970
But it can be soft and quiet too.'

201
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,310
Usually I don't feel sad about being deaf,
but I love the sea, and I would like to hear

202
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,430
what it sounds like very much.

203
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,550
I quickly told Ron about the man from the
shop before Mum came back with the tea.

204
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,639
'Actually, I think I know him,' Ron said after
a few moments.

205
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,130
'My brother's friend has a Saturday job at
that shop.

206
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,520
He's a student at the university.

207
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,410
He lives in Pete's house'

208
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,860
Pete is Ron's brother.

209
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,639
'I couldn't believe it!

210
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,620
My man lived in Pete's house!

211
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,009
What's his name?'

212
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:15,130
I asked.

213
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,759
'Jim, Ron told me.'

214
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,930
'Actually, Pete's having a party at his house
tonight.

215
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,010
Come with me.

216
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,310
Jim will probably be there.'

217
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,480
Parties are difficult for me because I can't
talk to people.

218
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,709
It's different when I'm with my other deaf
friends because we sign to each other and

219
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,839
we laugh a lot.

220
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,420
Going to a party with them is different to
going to any other sort of party.

221
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,769
We all speak the same language.

222
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:46,000
When I'm at a party with them, I'm in the
centre of things.

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,330
At parties with hearing people, I'm on the
outside.

224
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,800
Or I feel as if I am.

225
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,370
Ron knew what I was thinking.

226
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,040
'Come to the party,' he signed.

227
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
'Please.

228
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,840
I'd like you to come.'

229
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,600
'OK' I said at last, just as Mum came in with
the tea.

230
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,930
CHAPTER FOUR
The party

231
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,680
Later I was looking at all my clothes when
Mum came into my bedroom.

232
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,290
I had a green dress in one hand and a short
black skirt in the other hand.

233
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,870
I wasn't happy with the dress or the skirt.

234
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,889
Mum took a blue jumper from the bed and gave
it to me.

235
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:29,079
'The weather man on the television says that
it will snow,' she said.

236
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:33,570
Then she smiled and kissed me, and I felt
bad that she didn't know about Jim.

237
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,420
I decided to tell her as soon as there was
anything to tell.

238
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,930
If there was anything to tell.

239
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,860
It was almost spring, but it was still very
cold.

240
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,490
Ron and I stopped to buy some drinks on the
way to the party and by the time we got to

241
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,579
Pete's house it was beginning to snow.

242
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:54,050
Ron looked at me as we waited at the door.

243
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,110
'OK?' he asked.

244
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,240
I smiled at him.

245
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,740
'Yes,' I said.

246
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
'I'm OK.'

247
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,210
A girl opened the door and said hello to Ron.

248
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,089
I didn't know her.

249
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,220
She was very pretty and she was wearing a
nice red dress.

250
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,100
I smiled at her and followed Ron into the
house.

251
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,779
Inside, we went into the kitchen.

252
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,589
It was full of people.

253
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:24,660
All the girls were wearing short dresses or
skirts.

254
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,320
I was the only one wearing a jumper and jeans.

255
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,140
Ron and I took our drinks into the living
room.

256
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,259
This room was full of people too.

257
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:39,370
And it was hot - very hot -but I couldn't
take my jumper off because I wasn't wearing

258
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,660
a T-shirt under it.

259
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,500
The jumper was a mistake, but I tried to forget
about it.

260
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,830
'The music's very loud,' I said to Ron.

261
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,170
'How do you know that?' he asked and smiled.

262
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:59,030
'Because I can feel it in my legs,' I told
him, and it was true.

263
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,095
It was like my hand on Mum's guitar.

264
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:03,790
The vibration of the music was travelling
from the floor into my feet.

265
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,850
Then it was going right up my legs and into
my body.

266
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,389
A man came up to us.

267
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:12,459
It was Pete.

268
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:15,490
He said something to Ron, then looked right
at me.

269
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,080
Pete knows I'm deaf of course.

270
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,620
'Hello, Sam' I saw his mouth saying.

271
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,740
'Where's Jim?'

272
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,600
I wanted to ask, but I didn't.

273
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,240
I just said hello and smiled.

274
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,470
Pete talked to us for a while, then he went
to change the music.

275
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,470
Ron talked to me.

276
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,290
People in the room watched us talking with
our hands.

277
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,300
People often watch when I use sign language.

278
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,129
It's interesting for them, I think.

279
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:49,430
Ron told me about the fun he was having with
his new friends in London.

280
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,150
He talked a lot about a girl called Mary.

281
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,240
'Is Mary your girlfriend?'

282
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,480
I asked him, and his face went a bit red.

283
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,389
'At the moment she's just a friend,' he said.

284
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:03,230
'But I want her to be my girlfriend.'

285
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,920
I thought about Jim.

286
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,709
Where was he?

287
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,279
Why wasn't he here?

288
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,509
The party was in his house!

289
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:14,250
Ron often knows what I'm thinking.

290
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,029
'Hell come soon,' he told me.

291
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:21,759
Around ten o'clock, Ron was talking to some
other friends across the room.

292
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,230
I felt very hot in my jumper, so I decided
to go into the garden for a short time.

293
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,360
Outside, everything was white.

294
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,720
There was snow everywhere, and it was beautiful.

295
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,070
The garden looked like a big white cake, and
I was the first person to walk on it.

296
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,310
Or, I thought I was the first person to walk
on it.

297
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,520
But after a few moments I saw that I wasn't.

298
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,399
I could see empty places in the snow made
by shoes - footprints.

299
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,600
But I couldn't see anyone.

300
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,470
But I knew someone was there because just
then something very cold hit the side of my

301
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,940
face.

302
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,410
Snow!

303
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,149
CHAPTER FIVE
Snow fun

304
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:05,530
More snowballs flew past my face.

305
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,169
Then I saw someone come out from behind a
white tree.

306
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:12,079
It was the man from the shop!

307
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,040
It was Jim!

308
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,520
I laughed and quickly made a snowball.

309
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,780
Then I sent it through the air.

310
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,800
But Jim moved so quickly to one side the snowball
hit a tree behind him.

311
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,910
So I started to make another snowball, but
before it was ready, Jim threw a new one at

312
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,360
me.

313
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,850
I laughed again.

314
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,990
Then I ran behind a wall and made lots of
snowballs.

315
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,010
When they were ready, I came out from behind
the wall.

316
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,750
But Jim had made lots of snowballs too, and
soon I was very wet.

317
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,850
After a few minutes I was laughing so much
my stomach hurt, just the way it does when

318
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,909
I'm laughing at parties with my deaf friends.

319
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:57,200
When I looked up at last, I saw that Jim was
standing quite close to me.

320
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,809
I also saw that something was wrong.

321
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:02,309
He wasn't smiling now.

322
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,620
He was looking at me.

323
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,970
I remembered how he looked at me in the shop
and I knew it was the same now.

324
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,850
He was waiting for me to answer him.

325
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,320
But I couldn't.

326
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,490
I looked into his face, waiting for him to
speak again.

327
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,150
After a while, he did, and this time I watched
his mouth very carefully.

328
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:26,110
There was an outside light on the side of
the house.

329
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,919
Anyway, the snow all around us made it almost
as light as day.

330
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,309
'What's your name?' he asked.

331
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:37,710
This time I knew it was very important for
me say something.

332
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,200
'Sam,' I said carefully.

333
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,620
'My name's Sam.

334
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,970
Samantha.'

335
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,720
Then I told him: 'I can't hear what you say.

336
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
I'm deaf.'

337
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,429
He looked at me for a very long time, and
I wasn't sure if he understood.

338
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:56,350
Then he smiled.

339
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,630
'Can you lip-read, Sam?' he asked.

340
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,430
I nodded.

341
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,400
'Yes,' I said.

342
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
'Usually.'

343
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,860
'Then lip-read this,' he said, moving his
mouth carefully.

344
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,730
'The time for talking has finished.

345
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,870
Get your snowballs ready!'

346
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,809
Then he ran away and went back behind his
tree.

347
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:23,470
Before I could move, snowballs were coming
through the air again.

348
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,179
I ran back behind my wall, laughing.

349
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,850
My first snowball hit him in the face.

350
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:34,010
But he sent one back which got me on my face.

351
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,240
The snow was cold and wet in my eyes, but
I didn't mind.

352
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,760
I was happy.

353
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,500
I knew Jim was throwing snowballs at me because
he liked me.

354
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,780
Sometimes when people learn about me being
deaf they're very careful with me.

355
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,450
I feel like I'm a piece of expensive glass.

356
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,370
It's difficult to be friends with a piece
of expensive glass.

357
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,180
Bui Jim wasn't careful with me and I liked
that.

358
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,350
Soon I was very hoc.

359
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,370
But I didn't want to stop.

360
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,140
I wanted to throw snowballs at Jim all night.

361
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,480
But after about five minutes, Jim stopped.

362
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,429
When I looked over to see why, I saw his mouth
was moving.

363
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:17,730
But he wasn't looking at me, he was looking
at someone behind me.

364
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,000
I turned and saw a girl standing near the
house.

365
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,870
It was the girl in the red dress.

366
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,580
The same girl who opened the door when Ron
and I arrived at the party.

367
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,430
She was saying something to Jim and she didn't
look happy.

368
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,630
She wasn't smiling and her eyes were cold.

369
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,549
As cold as her legs in the short red dress.

370
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:42,960
Jim started to walk across the snowy grass.

371
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,700
When he got near to me, he smiled and looked
into my face.

372
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,000
'I'll win next time,' he said, then he went
inside with the girl.

373
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,039
I stayed on in the garden for a few minutes
more, but it wasn't much fun now.

374
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,890
You can't really throw snowballs at yourself.

375
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,850
When I went back in the house I found Ron
in the kitchen.

376
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,850
'Sam!

377
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,380
You're still here,' he signed.

378
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,740
'I was looking for you.'

379
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,809
He looked at my wet clothes.

380
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:13,480
'What happened to your jumper?'

381
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,610
Before I could answer I saw Jim on the other
side of the kitchen.

382
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,050
The girl in the red dress was talking to him,
but he wasn't listening.

383
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:26,740
He was watching me and Ron speaking with our
hands.

384
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,429
Ron saw who I was looking at.

385
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:34,590
'Have you been outside with Jim?' he asked,
and he smiled when my red face gave him my

386
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,590
answer.

387
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,059
'I've been with Jim and about a hundred snowballs.'

388
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:42,500
I smiled as I signed the words.

389
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,360
Ron laughed.

390
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,630
More people came into the kitchen and he moved
closer to me.

391
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,870
There wasn't enough room for him to sign now,
so he spoke carefully.

392
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,150
'It's very good to see you, Sam,' he said.

393
00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:00,070
I like London, but it's not so much fun without
you there'.

394
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,320
Ron is like my brother.

395
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,380
So when he kissed my face, I knew it was the
kiss of a brother to his sister.

396
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,070
But I didn't know if Jim knew that.

397
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,880
CHAPTER SIX
Spring cleaning

398
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,840
The next Saturday was the first Saturday in
Mareh.

399
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,279
Mum always likes us to clean the house on
the first Saturday in Mareh.

400
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,341
She calls it spring cleaning.

401
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:27,021
She was cleaning downstairs, and I was cleaning
upstairs.

402
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:32,860
I wanted to be upstairs because I could see
the shop from my bedroom window.

403
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:38,120
Downstairs there are always cars in the street
outside and you can't see out very well.

404
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:44,529
I really wanted to see Jim again, and I looked
out of the window often while I was cleaning.

405
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,400
Once he came outside to put some fruit and
flowers onto the cable, but he didn't look

406
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,900
across the road.

407
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,590
The snowball fight was a week ago now.

408
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,820
A week is a long time if you're in love.

409
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,720
It was sunny and the snow was gone now.

410
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,200
I was sorry about that.

411
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,110
'Haven't you finished this room, Sam?'

412
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,500
Mum stood in front of me, signing.

413
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,840
She couldn't understand why I was still cleaning
my room.

414
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,630
I'm usually quite quick ac cleaning.

415
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,179
When I'm not looking out of windows and remembering
snowballs.

416
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,250
'Sorry,' I answered, and she smiled.

417
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,159
'That's OK.

418
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:28,080
Actually, can you go to the shop to get a
bottle of window cleaner for me?

419
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,770
I forgot to buy some.'

420
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,340
I couldn't believe it!

421
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,110
She was sending me to the shop!

422
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,299
'Do you feel OK, Sam?'

423
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:38,350
Mum asked me.

424
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,600
'You look hot.''

425
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,500
'Yes,' I answered.

426
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,950
'I feel fine.'

427
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,049
But I knew my face was red.

428
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:49,340
'Are you sure?'

429
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,340
she said.

430
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,179
I'll go to the shop if you want.'

431
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:54,260
'No!'

432
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,409
I signed.

433
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:57,409
I'll go.'

434
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:01,600
And I quickly went downstairs and left the
house.

435
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,250
Jim was busy when I went into the shop.

436
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,942
He was standing near the bottles of wine with
a man.

437
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:11,580
He was helping the man to decide which wine
to buy.

438
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,110
The man was quite short.

439
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,180
Jim smiled at me over his head.

440
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,740
I smiled at him, and then I went over to the
bottles of cleaner.

441
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,590
Mum always buys the same window cleaner, but
I stood in front of the different bottles

442
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,920
as if I didn't know which one was best.

443
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,049
I wanted the short man to choose his wine
quickly and leave.

444
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:34,049
I wanted Jim to myself.

445
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:39,480
At last the man left, carrying two bottles
of wine, one-red, one white.

446
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,429
I took my window cleaner over to Jim to pay
for it.

447
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:48,210
When I got there he was writing something
on a piece of paper.

448
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,440
Then he gave it to me.

449
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,230
The writing was large and black.

450
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:56,600
It was like an artist's writing.

451
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,549
I read the words: 'I know more about snowballs
than wine.'

452
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:59,860
I laughed.

453
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,110
'Did you enjoy our snowball fight?

454
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,260
He wrote next.

455
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,669
I took the pen from him.

456
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:11,100
'Yes, I wrote, I did.

457
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,950
Very much.'

458
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,210
After he'd read my words, he looked at me.

459
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,000
Then he started writing again.

460
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,340
'Is Ron your boyfriend?'

461
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,880
I read.

462
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,669
This time I didn't write, I spoke.

463
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:26,320
'No,' I said.

464
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,530
'He's my best friend.

465
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,300
I haven't got a boyfriend.'

466
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,070
Jim understood me without any problem.

467
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,620
Or I think he did, because he smiled.

468
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:42,710
'Do you want to meet me tomorrow night?' he
said, and he moved his mouth carefully so

469
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,670
I could lip-read his words.

470
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,500
'Yes,' I said.

471
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,510
'I'd like that.'

472
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:52,850
'How long does it take to buy window cleaner,
Sam?'

473
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,460
Mum asked me when I got back to the house,
but I only smiled.

474
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,360
'Sorry, Mum' I signed and hurried quickly
upstairs.

475
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,810
It wasn't until I started cleaning Mum's bedroom
that I thought about the girl in the red dress

476
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,250
again.

477
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,250
Who was she?

478
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,970
But I was afraid of the answer.

479
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:15,390
I liked Jim too much and I didn't want to
think about the girl in the red dress.

480
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,191
CHAPTER SEVEN
A new boyfriend

481
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:22,490
Next day, Mum and I went to Winterton for
a walk.

482
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,310
Winterton is one of my favourite places.

483
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,370
It's cast of Norwich, by the sea.

484
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,410
Winterton is where Mum took me and Ron when
we were children.

485
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,040
It takes about forty-five minutes to drive
there.

486
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,460
We put on our coats and made some coffee and
some sandwiches to take with us.

487
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,530
On the beach it was cold but sunny.

488
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,020
Some children were running by the sea with
their dog.

489
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,049
As we walked along, I told Mum about Jim.

490
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:55,320
When I was finished, my face was a bit red.

491
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,860
'You really like him, don't you?'

492
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,420
she said, looking at me.

493
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,630
It was windy by the sea.

494
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:06,870
Mum's hair was all over her face, but I could
see her smile through it.

495
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,440
'Yes,' I said, 'I do.'

496
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,950
Just for a moment, she looked a little sad.

497
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:17,030
She walked ahead a short way, then she looked
back at me.

498
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,900
'Love is wonderful,' she said, smiling again.

499
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,650
'Enjoy it while you can, Sam.

500
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,660
Enjoy it while you can.'

501
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,140
I did enjoy myself that evening.

502
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,990
Very much.

503
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,080
Jim and I went to a bar in the centre of Norwich.

504
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,169
It was in the old area of town, close to the
river.

505
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:39,429
There was a pool table in the bar.

506
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:42,399
I like playing pool.

507
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,360
Ron taught me how to play, years ago.

508
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,740
Now I'm better than him.

509
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,610
Jim saw me looking at the pool table and the
next moment he was putting some money into

510
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,490
the side of it.

511
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,340
We played and I won easily.

512
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,740
It only took five minutes.

513
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,860
My last boyfriend got angry when he lost.

514
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,510
But when I looked at Jim I saw that he was
laughing.

515
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,750
I liked that.

516
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,730
'Very good!' he said.

517
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,400
'But my snowballs are better than yours!

518
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,210
Then he looked at me.

519
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,769
'Can you understand me?'

520
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:20,769
I smiled.

521
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:21,769
'Yes,' I said.

522
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,320
'I can understand if you speak slowly.

523
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,700
Can you understand me?'

524
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,490
Jim smiled too.

525
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,669
'Yes,' he said, 'I can understand you very
well.'

526
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:36,159
We sat down together at a table and for the
next two hours we talked.

527
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,220
Most of the time we spoke to each other, and
sometimes we wrote things down.

528
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,620
I didn't think about how we were talking.

529
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,060
I was too interested in what we were saying.

530
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,010
This was what I found out about Jim.

531
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:55,179
He was twenty-one years old and he was studying
English at university in Norwich.

532
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:58,880
This was his last year as a student.

533
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,990
His family lived in Derbyshire, in the middle
of England.

534
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:08,919
He had a brother of twenty-five, a sister
of seventeen and a dog called Sky.

535
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,460
He liked walking in the hills near his family
home.

536
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,659
He told me that in winter the hills were often
white with snow.

537
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:19,269
Winter was his favourite time.

538
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:23,679
Then he told me the only two things he didn't
like about Norfolk: there weren't many hills

539
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,450
and it didn't snow very often!

540
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:30,680
Mum has told me that people who live in different
places in England sound different when they

541
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,190
speak.

542
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,140
People from Derbyshire sound different to
people from London, and people from London

543
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,149
sound different to people from Norwich.

544
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:41,520
They have different accents.

545
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,530
So I knew that Jim probably had a different
accent to the other people around us in the

546
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,530
bar.

547
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:50,850
Then Jim wanted to know about me, so I told
him about my job at Busy Kids.

548
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:56,080
I said that I spent a lot of my time playing,
and that the children don't mind about me

549
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,850
being deaf.

550
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,980
I won't always work at Busy Kids, 'I finished,
I like working there but I also like writing

551
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,460
stories.

552
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,230
One day I want to write a book.'

553
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,909
'I'm sure you will,' Jim said.

554
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:11,320
'You'll write a book and you'll be famous.'

555
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,380
'I just want to be happy,' I wrote on his
piece of paper.

556
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,380
But I was already happy.

557
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,820
Happy being with Jim.

558
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,610
'What's it like to be deaf?'

559
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,909
Jim asked then, and I thought for a moment.

560
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:29,789
'You don't mind me asking you that, do you?'

561
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:31,029
Jim asked.

562
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,289
'No,' I wrote.

563
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,269
'I want to tell you.

564
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:35,720
But it's difficult'

565
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,910
'I think it must be very peaceful,' Jim said.

566
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,220
'I like noise, but sometimes I need to be
quiet.

567
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,330
That's when I go to the countryside for a
walk.'

568
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,330
He laughed.

569
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,270
'But actually the countryside can be a very
noisy place!

570
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,769
There are cars and animals and birds singing.'

571
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:59,480
'Mum likes listening to the birds sing,' I
told him.

572
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,790
'Yes, I do too.' he said.

573
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,010
And the sound of the wind in the trees.

574
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:10,830
'Sometimes my world is too quiet,' I said,
and Jim touched my hand.

575
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,880
'Don't be sad,' he said, and I smiled.

576
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,260
'I'm not sad,' I said, and it was true.

577
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,080
I was very happy, being with Jim.

578
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,890
'I think being deaf is a bit like swimming
underwater,' I told him.

579
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,799
'You know, when you're swimming and you look
up through the water.

580
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,690
Everything looks different.

581
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,190
The water changes everything.'

582
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,789
Jim moved his chair near to mine and took
my hand in his.

583
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:41,029
'Fish always live in the water,' he said.

584
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:43,070
'It's all they know.'

585
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:46,940
'Yes,' I said, and I knew he understood what
I was trying to tell him.

586
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,720
'Fish don't know that the water makes things
look different.'

587
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,019
When the bar closed, Jim walked home with
me.

588
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:56,669
He had his bicycle with him.

589
00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:00,670
It was dark, so I couldn't read his lips,
but I didn't mind.

590
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,350
It was nice just to be with him.

591
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,900
We lived in different worlds because I was
deaf, and he wasn't.

592
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,010
But it wasn't important.

593
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,580
Outside my house, we stopped under a street
light.

594
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,070
Jim looked into my eyes.

595
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,309
'What's your mobile phone number?

596
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:20,210
So I can text you.'

597
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,860
I told him my mobile phone number.

598
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,830
Then I showed him how to say goodbye in sign
language.

599
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,630
He tried it a few times.

600
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,519
Then, he showed me another way to say goodbye.

601
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,309
With a kiss.

602
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:37,789
I liked that way best.

603
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:42,200
CHAPTER EIGHT
The girl in the red dress

604
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,220
That evening was the beginning of something
wonderful, because Jim and I met often after

605
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,900
that.

606
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,139
Sometimes he went out with his friends or
stayed at home to study.

607
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:53,940
But we saw each other as often as we could.

608
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,370
We met in cafes or in bars, or we just went
for walks.

609
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:03,190
Sometimes we used pen and paper to talk, but
usually I read his lips.

610
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,890
I showed him some more sign language too.

611
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,390
But often we didn't have to talk at all.

612
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,770
We just liked being together.

613
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,920
When we weren't together we sent each other
text messages and emails.

614
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,789
In this way we spoke to each other every day.

615
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:24,110
Sometimes I felt I was living a dream, a very
good dream.

616
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,150
I was in love and I was very happy.

617
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,924
Until the day I met the girl in the red dress
again.

618
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:32,924
The girl from the party.

619
00:33:32,924 --> 00:33:36,519
It was a Monday morning and I was on my way
to work.

620
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:40,799
Mum had left early to meet a new parent, so
I was walking.

621
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,340
It was a sunny day, and I was feeling good.

622
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:50,690
I went to the shops to buy food for the children's
lunches and then I walked through the park.

623
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:55,139
I was probably thinking about Jim, because
I was always thinking about Jim.

624
00:33:55,139 --> 00:34:00,649
I didn't see the girl with the red dress until
she stood in front of me.

625
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:04,840
She wasn't wearing a red dress that day, of
course, but I knew who she was.

626
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,630
'Hello,' I said, but she didn't say anything.

627
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,750
She just stood there and looked at me.

628
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,690
Then, when she started speaking, she talked
really quickly.

629
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,430
Too quickly.

630
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,120
'Please,' I said.

631
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,200
'Can you speak more slowly?

632
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,700
I can't understand you.'

633
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,130
She looked cross.

634
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,220
'What?'

635
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,040
I saw her say.

636
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,250
'I can't understand you!

637
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,780
My face went red, but I tried again, speaking
carefully.

638
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,110
'Please speak more slowly so I can read your
lips.

639
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,110
I'm deaf.'

640
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,340
When she spoke again, she spoke very slowly.

641
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,790
Too slowly.

642
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:48,400
I could understand every word.

643
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,690
'Jim was my boyfriend before he met you,'
she said.

644
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,490
'My boyfriend.

645
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:56,140
We were very happy together.

646
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,050
Very happy.

647
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:02,220
I'm good for him in a way you can never be
good for him.

648
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,920
How can you be good for him?

649
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,770
You can't hear his music!'

650
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,910
'His music?'

651
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,380
I didn't understand what she meant.

652
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,380
She looked at me.

653
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,870
'Don't you know about his music?'

654
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,550
she said.

655
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,550
Jim plays in a band!

656
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,570
I can't believe you don't know that!

657
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,440
The band means everything to him.

658
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
Everything.

659
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,380
And he needs to be with someone who can hear
his music.

660
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,380
Jim writes songs.

661
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,370
Didn't you know that?

662
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:37,740
You really don't know Jim very well, do you?

663
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,410
He writes songs and he plays them to me before
he tries them with the band.

664
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,350
He could never do that with you, could he?

665
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,450
So stay away from him, understand?

666
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,210
You'll never make him happy the way I do.'

667
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,680
She waited for a moment to see if I would
say anything, but I was too hurt inside to

668
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,390
speak.

669
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,360
Hurt and afraid.

670
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,890
So she said it one more time: 'Stay away from
Jim.'

671
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,340
Then she left.

672
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,680
There was a seat in the park under a tree.

673
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,950
I sat down on it and watched her walk away.

674
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,670
My head hurt.

675
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,110
It was lull of her words.

676
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,730
She was Jim's girlfriend until he met me.

677
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,160
Was that true?

678
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,390
Why didn't he tell me?

679
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,900
And he played music in a band...

680
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,470
Was that true as well?

681
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,710
I thought I knew Jim, but now...

682
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,970
I didn't know what to believe or to think
I only knew that I was afraid.

683
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,560
Very afraid.

684
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,810
I knew why Jim never spoke to me about his
music.

685
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,640
Because I'm deaf.

686
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,270
Just then I felt my phone ring.

687
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,280
I took it from my bag and looked at it.

688
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,970
There was a text message from Jim.

689
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,790
Meet me tonight.

690
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,790
I love you, Jim

691
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,260
I didn't answer the message.

692
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,610
Mum looked at me when I arrived at Busy Kids.

693
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,940
'Are you all right, Sam?'

694
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,110
she asked me.

695
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,620
'You look ill.'

696
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,320
'I'm OK,' I signed and I took the shopping
into the kitchen where we make the children's

697
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,140
lunches.

698
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,140
Mum followed me.

699
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,590
'Sam?'

700
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,590
she said.

701
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,590
'What is it?'

702
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:20,180
I didn't want to talk about it.

703
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,880
But Mum's face was very worried, so I told
her.

704
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,510
'You must speak to Jim,' she said.

705
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,060
'Do you want me to phone him?'

706
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,500
'No,' I said.

707
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,000
'No, thank you.

708
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I need to think.'

709
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,490
I was sad all day.

710
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,480
No, I was worse than sad.

711
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,050
My happy world was broken into pieces.

712
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,020
At four o'clock Mum told me to go home early.

713
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,070
'I've got a friend coming for dinner, but
I'm busy here,' she said.

714
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,790
'Can you cook something?'

715
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,850
I was happy to go home early, but I wasn't
hungry.

716
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:00,110
But I made a pizza for Mum and her friend.

717
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,930
Mum got home at six o'clock and went to have
a shower.

718
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,800
When somebody comes to the front door at our
house, the lights go on and off.

719
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,390
Then I know that someone's there.

720
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:15,020
The lights in the kitchen went on and off
while I was making a salad and Mum was in

721
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,020
the shower.

722
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,030
I went to the front door to see who it was.

723
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,470
I could see a man through the glass.

724
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,250
It was Jim.

725
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,630
I opened the door.

726
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,530
He was smiling, but I couldn't smile back.

727
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:34,170
I was pleased to see him, but I was sad too,
because of the meeting with the girl.

728
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,650
'Hi, Sam,' he said.

729
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,680
'These are for you.'

730
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,730
Then I saw he had some flowers.

731
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,560
Beautiful flowers.

732
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,350
Red roses, lots of them.

733
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,180
Flowers for a boyfriend to give to his girlfriend.

734
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,540
But in my head I saw the girl from the party
in her red dress.

735
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,600
The roses were the same colour as her dress.

736
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,000
Did Jim give her roses when he was her boyfriend?

737
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,610
'Thank you,' I took the flowers from him,
and when I looked up again, Jim was saying

738
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,620
something.

739
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,660
Except of course I didn't know what it was.

740
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:14,570
I don't think I have ever felt so sad about
being deaf as at that moment.

741
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:20,490
Jim took the flowers back from me and put
them down on a table inside the house.

742
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,070
Then he put his arms around me.

743
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,820
I knew he was trying to show me what he wanted
to say to me.

744
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:31,510
It was the same thing as his text message,
the same thing as the roses: 'I love you.'

745
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,960
I was happy that Jim loved me.

746
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,570
But I was still sad because I knew love wasn't
enough.

747
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,450
CHAPTER NINE
Pizza and talking

748
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:46,531
When I was about fifteen years old, my favourite
books and films were all love stories.

749
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:51,660
The stories were all the same.

750
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,630
There was a man (the hero) and a woman (the
heroine).

751
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,630
They met.

752
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:01,100
But there was always a problem which meant
they could not be together at first.

753
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,050
Perhaps the hero was hurt by love in the past
and didn't want a girlfriend now.

754
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:10,370
Or the heroine had an important job and didn't
have time for a boyfriend.

755
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:13,990
Anyway, these books or films always finish
in the same way.

756
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:19,470
The hero and the heroine know that they are
in love, so the problems aren't important.

757
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,530
The only important thing is their love.

758
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:27,670
When we tell children stories we often finish,
'and they were happy ever after'.

759
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,790
It's the same with love stories.

760
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:34,320
The hero and the heroine are always 'happy
ever after'.

761
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,430
Happy together always, with no problems.

762
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:42,550
But real life is different to stories, and
I'm not a heroine.

763
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:47,700
Anyway, I read hundreds of those books when
I was fifteen, and there was never a story

764
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,400
about a deaf girl with a boyfriend who played
music.

765
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,130
I moved away from Jim as Mum came down the
stairs.

766
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,980
Her hair was wet, but she was smiling at Jim.

767
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,200
I soon saw that he was the friend coming to
dinner.

768
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,000
'I don't want you to be sad,' she signed to
me while Jim put the roses in some water,

769
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,570
'so I phoned Jim and asked him to dinner.

770
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,620
After we've eaten, you can tell him why you're
sad.

771
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,390
And until then, I can find out more about
him.'

772
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:20,170
She was smiling like the children in the Busy
Kids nursery smile sometimes.

773
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,870
When they've done something a little bad.

774
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:27,940
I don't usually feel angry with the children,
and I couldn't feel angry with Mum.

775
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,560
While we are the pizza, Jim and Mum talked.

776
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,260
Mum laughed a lot.

777
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,720
I knew she liked Jim.

778
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,370
Of course she liked Jim.

779
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:43,090
Sometimes Mum signed to me to tell me what
she and Jim were talking about: his studies

780
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:48,510
at university, his family, her days as a musician
with the Sweet Pepper Band.

781
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,480
'Jim's father plays guitar,' she told me.

782
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,810
'He was quire famous when he was a young man.

783
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,570
Isn't that interesting?'

784
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,090
Mum was like a young girl.

785
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,240
She was having fun talking to Jim.

786
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,990
But I sat quietly, watching them.

787
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,460
I didn't eat very much.

788
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,650
I wasn't hungry.

789
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,120
I think Mum was asking Jim more questions
about his family.

790
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,750
But I just felt sad that I didn't already
know about his father being a famous musician.

791
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:24,100
After two months of being Jim's girlfriend
I didn't know his father was a famous musician.

792
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,310
I didn't know about Jim playing in a band.

793
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:32,780
And I didn't know that the girl from the party
was his girlfriend before me.

794
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,920
What else didn't I know?

795
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,380
'I'm going out now,' Mum said to me after
dinner.

796
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,350
'I'll wash the plates when I come home.

797
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,520
You stay here and talk to Jim.'

798
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,960
I saw her say goodbye, and then she left.

799
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,900
I took Jim's plate.

800
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,550
'Do you want a coffee?'

801
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,950
I asked him.

802
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:55,200
'No, thank you,' he said.

803
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,520
He was looking at me, waiting, but I didn't
know what to say or how to begin.

804
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,840
I only knew that I wanted to sign to him what
I was thinking and feeling.

805
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,020
I wanted him to understand signing.

806
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,650
Signing is my first language and I wanted
to talk to him about the girl from the party

807
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,110
in my first language.

808
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,470
Jim waited until I was looking at him.

809
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,150
'Your mum told me what happened,' he said.

810
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,120
'She told me about Lauren.'

811
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,580
So, I thought, that's what she's called.

812
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,580
Lauren.

813
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,580
I didn't like her and I didn't like her name.

814
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,960
'Sam,' Jim said, 'Lauren wasn't my girlfriend
when you and I met at the party.

815
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,480
We did go out together for a few months, but
that was last year.

816
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,520
We're just friends now.

817
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
Or we were friends.'

818
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,960
Oh, I'm so angry with her for hurting you!

819
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,850
I didn't think Jim would lie to me.

820
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,790
But he didn't tell me about his music...

821
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,861
Jim knew what I was thinking.

822
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:57,220
'I'm sorry I didn't tell you about my music,'
he said.

823
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,650
'You didn't tell me because it's a problem,'
I said, but he didn't agree.

824
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:05,020
'No,' he said, 'that's not true.'

825
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,250
'Yes, it is,' I said.

826
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,720
I told him he loves music and I can't hear
music.

827
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,050
It's a big problem- I told him he doesn't
want a deaf girlfriend, he wants a hearing

828
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,050
girlfriend.

829
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,420
But now Jim couldn't understand me.

830
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:24,380
I wasn't speaking very well because I was
angry and sad.

831
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,160
So I wrote it down for him: 'You want a girlfriend
who can hear your music.

832
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,520
I'm not good for you.'

833
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,590
Jim's face was very sad.

834
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,880
'Don't say that,' he said.

835
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,380
'It isn't true.

836
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,231
I know what I want, and that's you.

837
00:44:39,231 --> 00:44:42,490
You are good for me, Sam.

838
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:44,180
You're very good for me.'

839
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:49,580
When I didn't answer, Jim started to write
again: 'I want to be with you, Sam.'

840
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,460
'I want to be with you too.'

841
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,620
That's what I wanted to write.

842
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:57,260
But I didn't, because I couldn't forget Lauren's
words.

843
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,920
Maybe Jim did want me.

844
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,790
Maybe Lauren just wanted to hurt me.

845
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,940
But her words were true.

846
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,840
I could never know Jim, the man who played
music.

847
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,020
So, could I ever really know Jim?

848
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,170
CHAPTER TEN
Jim's band

849
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,670
Jim went home after that.

850
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:22,570
I told him to go because I needed to think.

851
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:25,720
Before he went, he wrote something down and
gave it to me.

852
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,700
I read it after he left.

853
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:33,100
It said: 'I believe that sometimes it's more
important to feel than to think.

854
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,750
We love each other.

855
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:36,890
Don't forget that.'

856
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,070
I didn't forget it.

857
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,010
I thought about it all the time.

858
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:43,930
But I also remembered Lauren's words.

859
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:45,780
And Jim's music.

860
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,970
It was the worst time of my life.

861
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,130
Mum knew I was sad.

862
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,200
'Take a holiday from work, Sam,' she told
me.

863
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,820
'Visit Ron in London.'

864
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,330
I thought it was a good idea.

865
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,950
I always had fun with Ron.

866
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:03,950
So I went.

867
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:08,000
But it's difficult to have fun with anyone
when your world is in pieces.

868
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,680
I was in London, not Norwich, but I still
was thinking about Jim; I wasn't having fun

869
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,680
at all.

870
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,450
And I soon saw that Ron and his friend Mary
were boyfriend and girlfriend now, not just

871
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,260
friends.

872
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,050
Ron felt bad about Jim and me.

873
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,220
He tried not to be too happy about Mary when
I was there.

874
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,900
He didn't want me to feel worse.

875
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,160
But every time he looked at her, he smiled.

876
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,420
And I understood.

877
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,970
Of course I understood!

878
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,230
Until a week ago it was the same for me.

879
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:44,440
I felt happy every time I looked at Jim.

880
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,440
But not anymore...

881
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,720
A few days later, when it was time for me
to catch the train home, Ron took me to the

882
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,720
station.

883
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,410
We stood together on the station platform
with hundreds of people hurrying to work around

884
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,080
us.

885
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,520
Ron signed to me, 'Sam, I don't think of you
as my deaf friend,' he said.

886
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,850
I think of you as my kind, funny friend.

887
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,780
I'm sure it's the same for Jim.'

888
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,040
'I'm so lucky to have you as my friend,' I
told him.

889
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,730
We kissed and said goodbye, and then I got
on the train.

890
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:20,430
I wanted to believe Ron, but Lauren's words
were always in my head: 'Jim wants to be with

891
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,160
someone who can hear his music.'

892
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,290
I knew it was true.

893
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:27,820
When I got home Mum looked at me.

894
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,620
She saw in my face that nothing was different.

895
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,600
'Send Jim a text message, Sam,' she said.

896
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,210
'Please.

897
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:37,250
Speak to him.

898
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,680
I hate to see you like this.'

899
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,150
'I can't,' I told her.

900
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,400
She looked at me for a long time.

901
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,690
'Do you know what I think?'

902
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:46,690
she said.

903
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:51,550
'I don't think this is about Jim at all.

904
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,640
I think it's about your father.'

905
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,940
I looked at her, but I didn't say anything.

906
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,020
I wanted to know what she meant.

907
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:04,280
'I didn't want to tell you this,' she said,
'but now I think its best.'

908
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,660
Mum's face was sad, and I felt afraid.

909
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,170
'What is it?'

910
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,860
I asked.

911
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,930
She closed her eyes for a moment.

912
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:18,040
'Your father left us because he met another
woman: a woman who didn't have any children

913
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,050
and who thought your father was wonderful.

914
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:24,440
She didn't want to play guitar or have children.

915
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,480
She only wanted to be with him.

916
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,600
Sam, your father didn't leave because you
were deaf.

917
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,590
He left because he didn't want to be a father
to any child.'

918
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:35,900
Mum was very sad now.

919
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,710
She was crying and her face was wet.

920
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:43,580
I wanted to put my arms around her, but she
started signing again.

921
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,510
'You think Jim will leave you after a few
months because you're deaf.

922
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,700
But I think you're wrong.

923
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,320
Jim isn't the same as your father.

924
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,200
He doesn't just think about himself.

925
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,800
He's a good man and he loves you.'

926
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,100
She smiled at me.

927
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,410
'Oh, Sam, I understand, I really do.

928
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,910
When you love somebody you feel afraid.

929
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:09,390
But it's better to feel afraid than to feel
sad.

930
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:13,650
Sometimes you have to fight for what you want.'

931
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,850
She put her arms around me and soon we were
both crying.

932
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:20,920
Then, after a few minutes, she smiled at me.

933
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,250
She looked happy now, like Mum again.

934
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,520
'Get your coat,' she told me.

935
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,550
'I know where Jim is.

936
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,710
We can go to see him.'

937
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:33,510
I didn't ask any questions, I just did what
she said.

938
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,270
I wanted to see Jim.

939
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:39,170
I wanted to see him very much.

940
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,800
Mum drove through the city centre.

941
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,600
I didn't know where we were going or how she
knew where Jim was- I was busy thinking about

942
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,910
love stories and about the problem keeping
me from Jim.

943
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:53,950
It wasn't that I was deaf and it wasn't because
my dad left when I was born.

944
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,680
It was me.

945
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,110
I was making problems because was afraid.

946
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:03,710
I was fighting against something I really
wanted, and it was stupid.

947
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:07,580
I could never kill my love for Jim; it was
too strong.

948
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:12,930
After ten minutes the car stopped and I saw
we were near a church.

949
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:17,540
But Mum didn't go into the church, she went
up to the building next to it, St Marks Church

950
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,190
Hall.

951
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,250
Before she opened the door, I stopped her.

952
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:24,090
'How did you know where to find Jim?'

953
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,960
I asked her.

954
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,200
Mum smiled.

955
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,430
'I came here while you were in London,' she
said and smiled again.

956
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,430
'Follow me.

957
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,640
It's all right.'

958
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,390
Then she opened the door and went in.

959
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:40,810
After a moment I went in after her.

960
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:44,020
And there was Jim with four other men.

961
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:48,992
They were playing music, and I knew this was
Jim's band.

962
00:50:48,992 --> 00:50:50,200
Jim was playing drums.

963
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,350
There were four drums of different sizes.

964
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,990
Jim was playing all of them.

965
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:59,580
His hands were moving very quickly.

966
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:02,290
Quicker than Mums hands when she's speaking
to me.

967
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:05,000
I watched him play for a few moments.

968
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,880
At first he didn't see me, but I was happy
just to look at him.

969
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,350
It was very good to see him again.

970
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:14,180
And now I was really seeing him.

971
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:19,500
Because this was the Jim who played music:
this was the real Jim.

972
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,411
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Happy ever after

973
00:51:22,411 --> 00:51:27,670
I knew the music was loud because I fell the
vibration of the sound in the floor under

974
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:31,120
my feet- Mum put her hands over her ears.

975
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:35,440
When Jim saw me there was not as much vibration
because he stopped playing his drums.

976
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,020
He got up and walked over to me and his friends
stopped playing too.

977
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:43,350
I think everyone was looking at us, but I'm
not sure.

978
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:48,500
All I remember is Jims smile and the love
in his eyes before he kissed me.

979
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,310
As I kissed him back, I forgot to be afraid.

980
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,780
This was Jim and I loved him.

981
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,600
There was nothing to be afraid of.

982
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:02,330
After a few moments he moved about a metre
away and started to sign to me.

983
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:04,811
He made some mistakes, but I understood.

984
00:52:04,811 --> 00:52:08,450
Just as he understood when I spoke to him.

985
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:11,460
And I remembered his fast hands on the drums...

986
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,880
There was no problem.

987
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,930
This is what he signed to me: 'Your mum taught
me some sign language.

988
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:21,340
Now I'll teach you to play drums.

989
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,800
Come with me.'

990
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,300
Before I could answer, Jim took my hand in
his.

991
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,210
We moved to stand with his friends.

992
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:32,060
Mum was smiling at me.

993
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,890
Everyone was smiling.

994
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:39,600
Jim stood behind me and his hands were on
my hands and then I was playing the drums.

995
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,370
And the vibration travelled from the drums
to my hands and up my arms to my head.

996
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,530
It was wonderful.

997
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:51,790
As wonderful as my small hand on the front
of Mum's guitar.

998
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:52,240
- THE END -
