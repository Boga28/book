00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,760
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,400
A Visitor

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,280
My name's Samuel. Lenny 
Samuel. You can call me Len.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm a private eye. A private eye is a 
private detective - a detective who will  

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,800
work for anyone who will pay him. I'm not a 
policeman. I work on my own as a private eye.

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,800
My office is on the west side of Los Angeles, 
on the fourth floor of a high building.  

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,200
There are only two rooms in my office - the 
outer room and the inner room. The outer  

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,080
room is the waiting-room. There are four chairs 
in the waiting-room, although there are never  

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,800
four people waiting to see me. In fact, there 
is usually no one at all waiting to see me.

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,760
In the inner room, there's a cheap wooden desk. 
There's a big wooden chair for me to sit on and,  

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,160
on the opposite side of the desk, there's 
a low metal chair for my visitors.  

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,680
The rest of the furniture in my office 
consists of a large, empty metal cupboard,  

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,040
and a low bed in one corner. When there is a 
lot of work, I sometimes sleep in the office.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,680
The notice outside my door says: "L. Samuel. 
Private Detective." That's me. I'm quite tall,  

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,120
nearly two metres, and I weigh eighty 
kilos. A lot of men say that I'm ugly,  

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,960
but women seem to find me attractive. I've got 
brown eyes, brown hair and very nice teeth.  

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,360
I had a good nose, too, until someone 
broke it in a fight last year.

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,720
Recently, I haven't been very busy. 
In fact, I've had very little to do.  

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,120
However, I did have some work last month. 
It all started late one afternoon, when I  

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,000
was sitting in my office. I had just finished 
cutting my nails and I was about to clean them.

21
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,160
Suddenly, I heard someone 
walk into the outer room.  

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,320
I always leave the door of the outer room open, 
in case anyone wants to come in and see me.  

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,480
When I heard the footsteps in the 
outer room, I wasn't very surprised.

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,800
I thought that someone had made a 
mistake and come into the wrong office.  

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,520
It was probably someone looking 
for the doctor next door.

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
But a moment later, there was a very 
quiet knock on the door of the inner room.

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,680
'Come in,' I shouted and put away the 
scissors I had been cutting my nails with.

28
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,960
The door opened and in walked one 
of the most beautiful women I had  

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,040
ever seen. She was about eighteen years 
old, with blue eyes and long blonde hair.  

30
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,560
She was wearing a smart green coat and 
had a big brown handbag over her shoulder.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,240
'Excuse me,' said the girl. 
'I'm looking for Mr Samuel.'

32
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,720
'I'm Samuel,' I said, with a quick 
smile. 'Come in and sit down.'

33
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,360
The girl didn't smile back at me.

34
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,480
'No, I won't sit down,' she said.

35
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,800
'Well, if you won't sit down, at least 
come in and close the door,' I replied.

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,800
The girl came in, walked over 
and put her handbag on my desk.

37
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,000
'Now,' I said, 'what can I do for you?'

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,840
'I need help,' said the girl slowly.  

39
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,200
'But I don't know if you will be able to 
help me. Are you a real private detective?'

40
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,480
'Of course I am,' I replied angrily. 'Didn't 
you see the notice on the office door?  

41
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,200
It says "L. Samuel. Private Detective." 
I'm Samuel. I'm a private eye.'

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,640
'All right, Mr Samuel,' the girl said 
coldly. 'There's no need to get angry.  

43
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,920
I have a little job for you.'

44
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,880
'Right,' I said quickly. 
'What do you want me to do?'

45
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,400
'It's very simple really,' the girl replied.  

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:59,840
'I want you to find my sister. 
She has disappeared.'
 
 

47
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,360
CHAPTER TWO

48
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
Please Find My Sister

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,120
'I see,' I said. 'Your sister has disappeared.  

50
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,080
Have you reported her 
disappearance to the police?'

51
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,240
The blonde girl shook her head. She looked 
very nervous and was starting to cry.

52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,320
'No, I haven't told the police,' she said.  

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,080
'I don't want any trouble with the police. 
I just want you to help find my sister.' She  

54
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,680
took a small, pink handkerchief out 
of her handbag and dried her eyes.

55
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,520
'All right,' I said. 'Tell 
me all about your sister.'

56
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,360
'Her name is Elaine Garfield,' said the girl.

57
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,840
'And what's your name?' I interrupted.

58
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,400
'Helen. Helen Garfield,' she replied. 
'My sister disappeared a week ago.  

59
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,240
We had arranged to have dinner together 
last Monday night, but she didn't come.'

60
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,200
'Perhaps your sister didn't come because she 
doesn't like the food you cook,' I suggested.

61
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,080
'Don't try to be funny. I flew all the 
way from New York to see her last Monday,'  

62
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,040
she said angrily.

63
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,800
'Oh, so you don't live in 
Los Angeles, then,' I said.

64
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,520
'No,' she replied quickly, 'I live in New York. 
I flew right across America to see my sister,  

65
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,400
but, when I got here, I discovered 
that she had disappeared.'

66
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,760
'How do you know she has disappeared?' I asked.  

67
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
'Perhaps your sister just 
forgot about the dinner.'

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,480
The blonde girl took a deep breath.

69
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,800
'Look,' she said, 'Let me finish my story. If you  

70
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,520
don't stop asking questions, I'll 
find myself another detective.'

71
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,080
'Right,' I said, 'I'm listening.'

72
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,960
'I waited for my sister last Monday evening, in 
my hotel,' said the girl. 'But she didn't come.  

73
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,080
I telephoned her, but there was no answer. So 
the next morning, I went to the office where  

74
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,280
she worked. At her office, they said that she 
had been to work the day before, on the Monday.  

75
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,800
They also told me that she'd left 
suddenly, in the middle of the afternoon,  

76
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,600
without telling anyone. After that I went 
round to her flat, but there was no one there.'

77
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,880
The girl stopped for a minute, and then continued.

78
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,480
'Mr Samuel,' she said, 'I'm very worried 
about my sister. It's not usual for her to  

79
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,280
disappear suddenly like this. I'm sure that 
she's in danger and I want you to find her.'

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,680
'All right,' I said. 'It may 
be easy or it may be difficult,  

81
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,800
but I'll find her. But first, tell me why 
you've waited six days before coming to me.'

82
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,600
'That's none of your business,' the girl said.

83
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,280
'OK,' I replied. 'Your sister's name is 
Elaine Garfield. What does she look like?'

84
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,560
'Oh, that's easy,' Helen Garfield 
replied, 'she looks like me. We're twins.  

85
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,360
Now, Mr Samuel, how much money do you charge?

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,520
'Fifty dollars a day,' I said.

87
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,800
'Very well, Mr Samuel,' said the girl, 
'but fifty dollars a day is a lot of money.  

88
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,480
I hope that you will work hard for it.'

89
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,320
'Oh yes,' I replied, with a smile, 'I'll work 
very hard. Now give me the address of your  

90
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,400
sister's flat, and the name of the office 
where she works. I'll start work at once.'

91
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,280
The blonde girl wrote the addresses on 
a piece of paper and gave me the paper.

92
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,840
'One more thing,' I said. 'Can 
you give me your address, too?'

93
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,720
'That won't be necessary,' she 
replied, as she picked up her handbag.  

94
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,680
'I'll come and see you again tomorrow afternoon, 
at five o'clock. Goodbye, Mr Samuel.' 

95
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,320
Without waiting for an answer, the girl 
turned around and walked out of the office.

96
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,760
As I watched her walk out of 
my office, I smiled to myself.  

97
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:43,840
'This is better than cleaning my nails,' 
I thought. Then I began my work.
 
 

98
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,720
CHAPTER THREE

99
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,680
The Manson Building

100
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
After the blonde girl had left my office,  

101
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,840
I looked at the two addresses which she had 
written on the piece of paper. The first was:

102
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
Elaine Garfield,

103
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,680
Apartment 716,

104
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,800
Manson Building,

105
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,680
Sunset Place.

106
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,720
The second address was:

107
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,000
Myer and Myer,

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,960
Attorneys,

109
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,320
Title-Insurance Building

110
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,880
Putting the paper in my pocket, I 
got up and walked towards the door.  

111
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,040
Then I stopped and went back to my desk. I opened 
the top left-hand drawer and took out my gun,  

112
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,200
a .38 Smith and Wesson. Then I 
put the gun back in the drawer.  

113
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,000
I decided that it was safer to leave it behind. 
It's easy to get shot, if you're carrying a gun.

114
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,360
I ran down the stairs, all four 
floors, and out into the street.  

115
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,080
My old grey Chrysler was outside, so I jumped 
in and drove off fast, towards Sunset Place.

116
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
The Manson Building was a tall, 
ugly block of apartments. I parked  

117
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,840
the Chrysler outside and walked 
towards the big glass front doors.

118
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,200
'Hey, mister!' a voice said.

119
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,760
I continued walking.

120
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,080
'Hey, mister!' said the voice again. 
'You can't leave your car there.'

121
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,640
I stopped and turned around. A man in a 
grey uniform was standing by the Chrysler.

122
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,240
'Hey, mister!' the man repeated, 
'you can't park your car here.'

123
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,480
'Why not?' I asked.

124
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,640
'Because only people who live in the 
Manson Building can park here,' he replied.

125
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,280
'So,' I said, 'How do you know that 
I don't live in the Manson Building?'

126
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,960
'Because I'm the porter,' the man 
replied. 'I work in the entrance of  

127
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,800
the building and let people in and out 
of the door. I know everybody here.'

128
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,080
'Right,' I said, 'then please let me in.'

129
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,840
The porter and I walked up to the big 
glass front doors and he let me in.

130
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,080
'Who do you want to see?' the porter asked.

131
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,480
'Miss Elaine Garfield,' I said. 
'She lives in Apartment 716.'

132
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,240
'I'm sorry,' the porter 
replied, 'Miss Garfield is out.'

133
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,320
'When did she go out?' I asked, 
trying not to look interested.

134
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,160
'Mind your own business,' said the 
porter. 'I'm not going to tell you.  

135
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,600
And I'm not going to let you go up to Miss 
Garfield's apartment, when she's not there.'

136
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,160
'Why don't you go for a 
walk?' I said to the porter  

137
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,560
and put five dollars in his hand. I gave 
the porter the money to make him go away.

138
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,560
The porter shook his head.

139
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,720
'No,' he said.

140
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,200
I gave the porter five dollars more.

141
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,400
'Now go for a long walk,' I said.

142
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,120
The porter went out into the street  

143
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:31,840
and I went up to Apartment 716, 
Miss Elaine Garfield's apartment.
 
 

144
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,400
CHAPTER FOUR

145
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,400
A Very Tidy Apartment

146
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,640
I rang the bell beside the door 
of Apartment 716 and waited.

147
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,720
There was no answer. I rang again, but there 
was still no answer. Then I took a small,  

148
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,200
square piece of plastic out of my pocket. I 
looked around. I was alone. I pushed the piece  

149
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,240
of plastic into the space between the door and 
the door frame and moved the plastic up and down.  

150
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,440
In a minute, the door opened 
and I went into the flat.

151
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,360
I stood still and listened. There was silence.  

152
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,320
I switched on the light and looked 
around. It was a modern apartment.  

153
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,680
I was standing in the living-room. Through an 
open door on my left, I could see the bedroom  

154
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,400
which was very neat and tidy. I looked 
in the wardrobe - it was almost empty.

155
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,760
'That's funny,' I thought. 'People who disappear 
don't usually take most of their clothes with  

156
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,080
them. They only take their clothes if they've been 
planning their disappearance for a long time.'

157
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,240
I walked back into the living-room 
and searched it carefully.  

158
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,760
But I found nothing to explain 
Elaine Garfield's disappearance.  

159
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,800
Then I went into the kitchen. The kitchen was 
also very clean and tidy. There were no dirty  

160
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,760
plates or cups. There was no old milk in the 
refrigerator. Everything was in its place.

161
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,600
'Well,' I thought, 'there's only 
the bathroom left to search now.'

162
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,240
The bathroom, too, was empty and clean. I walked 
quickly around the flat, making sure that I hadn't  

163
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,800
forgotten anything. I wiped everything I had 
touched with my handkerchief, because I didn't  

164
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,280
want to leave any fingerprints. Then I switched 
off the lights and opened the door to leave.

165
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,840
But I didn't leave. There were two men standing 
outside the door. One of them was short and had  

166
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,120
red hair and a nasty smile. The other was 
quite tall and was wearing a hat pulled  

167
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,480
down over his face. The one with the hat was 
holding a gun and the gun was pointing at me.

168
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,240
I tried to close the door, but the red-haired 
man put his foot out to stop the door closing.  

169
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,080
I let go of the door. The door 
opened and both the men came  

170
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,080
in. The one with the hat was in front 
and he was still carrying the gun.

171
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,160
'Hold your hands up in the 
air,' said the man with the gun.

172
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,800
Then he turned to the red-haired man.

173
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,560
'See if he's got a gun on him, Jo.'

174
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,080
Jo, the red-haired man, came over towards me. I 
waited. When Jo was between me and the man with  

175
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,280
the gun, I jumped. I jumped forward and caught 
Jo around the neck. I held him in front of me.  

176
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,320
The man with the gun couldn't shoot 
because he would hit his friend.

177
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,440
'Right,' I said to the man with 
the gun. 'Get out of the way.  

178
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm leaving now and I'm 
taking your friend with me.'

179
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,400
Holding Jo in front of me, I walked 
slowly towards the man with the gun.  

180
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,120
Then something went wrong with my plan.

181
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,880
The man with the gun started to laugh. He put 
the gun back in his pocket and stood laughing.

182
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,800
'Why are you laughing?' I asked.

183
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,160
'I'm laughing because you're so stupid,' the 
man with the gun said and walked up to me.

184
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
'Stop,' I said, 'or else I'll...'

185
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,240
'What will you do?' asked the man with the gun. 
'You can't do anything. I'm the one with the gun.'

186
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,160
As he said this, the man leant forward. He 
pulled Jo out of my hands and hit me in the face.  

187
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,280
I must say that I wasn't 
expecting to be hit in the face.  

188
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:58,560
It hurt. It hurt even more when he hit me again 
and I fell on the floor. I lay still on the floor,  

189
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,920
hoping that the two men would go away. But 
they didn't go away. Instead, they picked me  

190
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:15,840
up and hit me hard on the head. Everything went 
black. I lay on the floor - I was unconscious.
 
 

191
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,840
CHAPTER FIVE

192
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,440
Myer and Myer

193
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,080
I woke up with a terrible pain in my head.  

194
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,920
I was lying on the floor outside the front door of 
Miss Elaine Garfield's apartment. I looked around.  

195
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:48,080
The man with the gun and his red-haired friend had 
left. I was alone and I had a terrible headache.  

196
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,200
I got up slowly and felt my head gently, to see 
if there was any blood. There wasn't any blood,  

197
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,280
but my head was still very painful. I decided 
to go back to the office and go to bed.

198
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,760
There was no sign of the porter at 
the entrance to the Manson Building.  

199
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,840
I walked out of the door and across to the old 
grey Chrysler. I drove slowly back to the office.

200
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,520
The telephone was ringing when I arrived at 
the office. I went in quickly and answered it.

201
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,680
'Samuel speaking.'

202
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,480
'Listen, Samuel,' replied a 
voice. 'Forget about Elaine

203
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,920
Garfield. We hurt you a little in her apartment.  

204
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,600
If you don't forget all about Elaine 
Garfield, we'll hurt you a lot more.'

205
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,920
'Who are you?' I asked.

206
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,920
But there was no answer. The 
man had put down the telephone.

207
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,040
I decided to do what the man had told me. I would 
forget all about Elaine Garfield - for ten hours.  

208
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,080
After a good night's sleep, I would look for 
Elaine Garfield. I would also try to find the  

209
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,480
man with the gun and his friend, Jo. I lay down 
on the hard, low bed and went straight to sleep.

210
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,600
I woke up the next morning at eight 
o'clock. I felt my head carefully,  

211
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,040
but it did not hurt so much now.

212
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,320
I left the office and went across the street 
to the cafe where I usually had breakfast.  

213
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,280
I drank a glass of orange juice, ate some 
fresh toast and drank several cups of coffee.

214
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,880
I read the morning newspapers. There was a lot 
of news, but nothing about Miss Elaine Garfield.  

215
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,600
I looked at my watch, left the cafe 
and walked over to the Chrysler.

216
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,360
By nine o'clock, I was outside 
the Title Insurance Building.  

217
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,760
At three minutes past nine, I was standing outside 
the door of Myer and Myer, Attorneys. At twenty  

218
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,440
past nine, I was still standing outside the door. 
Nobody had arrived yet to work. At nine thirty,  

219
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,560
the first secretary arrived and, at eighteen 
minutes to ten, I was sitting in Mr Myer's office.

220
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,840
'Well, Mr Myer,' I said, 'my name's 
Samuel and I'm a private detective.'

221
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,560
'I'm pleased to meet you,' Mr Myer said politely.  

222
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,440
He was about fifty-five years old, with 
a grey suit, grey hair and a grey face.

223
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,880
'Does Miss Elaine Garfield work here?' I asked.

224
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,000
'Yes, she does,' Mr Myer said,  

225
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,840
'But she hasn't been to work since last 
Monday. Why do you want to see Elaine?'

226
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,520
'Her sister has asked me to 
help find her,' I replied.  

227
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,840
'Can you think of anything Elaine said or 
did which could explain her disappearance?'

228
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,520
Mr Myer scratched his head.

229
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,040
'No,' he said, 'I'm afraid I can't help you.'

230
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,920
'Who did Elaine work with?' I asked.

231
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,680
Mr Myer looked at me.

232
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,960
'Why do you say, "Who did Elaine work 
with?" and not "Who does Elaine work with?"  

233
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,440
Elaine's not dead, is she?' he asked.

234
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
I looked straight back at Mr Myer.

235
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,760
'I don't know if Elaine is dead or not,' I 
said. 'Would you be very sad if she was dead?'

236
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,600
'Yes, of course I would be 
sad!' Mr Myer replied angrily.  

237
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,920
'Are you trying to suggest 
that I know where Elaine is?'

238
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,600
I smiled.

239
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,320
'Now don't get excited, Mr Myer,' I said. 
'Can you tell me the name of anyone who  

240
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,640
works with Elaine - anyone who shares a 
desk with her or works in the same room?'

241
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,400
'Yes,' Mr Myer said, 'that's easy. 
Elaine shares a room with Suzy Graham.'

242
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,760
I got up.

243
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,040
'Thank you very much, Mr Myer,' I said. 
'Where is Suzy Graham's office, please?'

244
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,520
'It's along the corridor,' said Mr 
Myer 'the third door on the left.'

245
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,640
I thanked Mr Myer again and walked to the door.

246
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,080
'Oh, Mr Samuel,' Mr Myer said, 
'I'm sorry that I got angry,  

247
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,480
but you understand that I don't want...'

248
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,840
'Yes, I understand,' I interrupted. 'You don't  

249
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,800
want dirty private detectives 
in your nice, clean office.'

250
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,360
I walked out of Mr Myer's office 
and banged the door behind me.  

251
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,000
I walked slowly down the corridor and 
knocked on the third door on the left.

252
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,040
'Come in,' said a voice.

253
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,720
So I went into the room.

254
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,440
'Are you Suzy Graham?' I asked.

255
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,840
'Yes,' said the girl sitting 
at the desk. 'I'm Suzy.'

256
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,800
I smiled at her. Suzy, was the 
kind of girl everyone smiled at.  

257
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,240
She was small and slim and had 
a pair of beautiful, brown eyes.

258
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,680
'What can I do to help you?' Suzy asked.

259
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,040
I smiled again.

260
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,360
'I'd like to ask you some questions, Miss Graham.'

261
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,920
'Don't call me Miss Graham,' the 
girl said, 'you can call me Suzy.'

262
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,160
'Well, Suzy,' I said, 'I would like to ask 
you some questions about a friend of yours.  

263
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,840
Her name is Elaine Garfield.'

264
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,760
Suzy stopped smiling.

265
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,120
'Yes, all right,' she said. 'But I don't want 
to talk about Elaine here in the office.'

266
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,800
'Right,' I replied, 'I'll tell you what 
we'll do. We'll go out and find a cafe.  

267
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,560
I'll buy you a cup of coffee and you 
can tell me about Elaine. All right?'

268
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,200
Suzy cheered up and looked much happier.

269
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,920
'I'd like to have a cup of coffee,' she said, 'but 
Mr Myer might get angry if I leave the office.'

270
00:19:49,920 --> 00:20:05,840
'Don't worry about Mr Myer,' I said, with a 
big smile. 'Mr Myer and I are great friends.'
 
 

271
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,080
CHAPTER SIX

272
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,200
Suzy

273
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,960
Suzy put on her coat and we 
left the office together.  

274
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,360
We found a little cafe, just opposite 
the Title-Insurance Building.

275
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,680
In the cafe, I told Suzy why I was 
asking questions about Elaine Garfield.

276
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,240
'Elaine's twin sister, Helen, thinks that 
Elaine has disappeared, and she has asked  

277
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,240
me to find Elaine,' I said. 'Helen told me that 
she came to Myer and Myer last Tuesday. She was  

278
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,240
told that Elaine had left work suddenly, 
last Monday afternoon. Is that right?'

279
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,680
Suzy nodded.

280
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,120
'At least, part of it's right,' she said.  

281
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,840
'Elaine was at work last Monday, and she 
hurried off in the middle of the afternoon.'

282
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,360
Suzy stopped for a minute, and then she continued.

283
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,840
'But I don't remember seeing Elaine's sister,  

284
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,440
Helen, on Tuesday. In fact, I didn't 
even know that Elaine had a sister.'

285
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,520
'Elaine's sister lives in New York,' I explained. 
'Now, can you remember last Monday afternoon?  

286
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,680
Did Elaine give any reason for leaving suddenly?'

287
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,840
'Oh, yes,' Suzy said, 'Elaine said that she 
wasn't feeling well and was going to lie down.'

288
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,800
'Did Elaine receive any visitors or phone 
calls last Monday afternoon?' I asked.

289
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,920
'No, I don't think so,' said Suzy.  

290
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,920
'No wait a minute, I think ... yes, Elaine did 
receive a phone call, just before she left.'

291
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,520
I smiled.

292
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,160
'I don't suppose that, by chance, you might 
have heard any of the telephone conversation?'

293
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,720
'Certainly not,' Suzy replied, 'I don't 
listen to other people's phone calls.'

294
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,880
'Can you think of any reason why 
Elaine disappeared?' I asked.

295
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,160
'No,' Suzy replied, 'Elaine was 
always very friendly with everyone  

296
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,760
and she didn't seem to have any troubles.'

297
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,680
'Did Elaine have any special friends, any men 
or women she talked about a lot?' I asked.

298
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,600
'No, not really,' Suzy replied. 'Elaine and 
I used to be quite friendly and we went out  

299
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,680
dancing together a lot. But recently 
we haven't been out together at all'

300
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,200
'I understand,' I said, though I really 
didn't understand anything at all.  

301
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,040
'Can you remember the last time you went out 
together? Can you remember the place you went to?'

302
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,680
'Oh, that's easy,' Suzy said quickly, 'we went 
to the Las Cabanas Club. We always went there.  

303
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,920
It was about a month ago. We had an argument 
there and we haven't gone out together since.'

304
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
'What was the argument about?' I asked.

305
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,880
'It was after midnight,' Suzy explained, 'and I 
wanted to go home. But Elaine said she wanted to  

306
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,920
stay a bit longer. She said that she had met a 
wonderful man and didn't want to leave. I said  

307
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,600
I was going home and I left Elaine in the club. 
After that evening, one thing led to another.'

308
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,920
'What do you mean,' I asked, 
"...one thing led to another"?'

309
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,000
Suzy smiled.

310
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,440
'I often spoke to Elaine 
about the man she had met.  

311
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,360
Elaine thought he was wonderful. I 
told her that he was no good at all.'

312
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,000
'What did Elaine say when you told 
her that?' I asked, with interest.

313
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,840
'She became very angry,' replied Suzy. 'We 
haven't been out dancing together since then.'

314
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,600
I paid for the coffee.

315
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,240
'You've been very helpful, Suzy,' 
I said, 'and I've only got one more  

316
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,720
question. Can you remember the name of the 
man Elaine Garfield met at Las Cabanas?'

317
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,080
'Benny Greep,' Suzy said, 
'that's his name. Benny Greep.'

318
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,960
'Thank you very much indeed, Suzy,' I said, 
with a smile. 'You've been a great help.'

319
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,960
'Not at all,' Suzy said and looked at 
me with her beautiful, big, brown eyes.  

320
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,400
'If there's anything else I 
can do for you, just ask.'

321
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,640
I looked straight into her eyes.

322
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,440
'What are you doing tonight?' I asked.

323
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,400
'I'll be at home watching television,'  

324
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,440
Suzy replied. 'My boyfriend's a boxer and he's 
fighting in a match on television tonight.'

325
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,960
'Goodbye, Suzy,' I said and watched her as 
she walked back across the street to the  

326
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,840
Tide-Insurance Building. Her boyfriend 
was a boxer! That was just my luck.
 
 

327
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,360
CHAPTER SEVEN

328
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,080
Benny Greep

329
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,720
I looked at my watch. It was nearly eleven 
o'clock. I went back into the cafe and asked if I  

330
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,800
could look at the telephone book. I turned to "L" 
and ran my finger down the outside of the page.  

331
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:37,280
Soon, I found the name I was looking for: "Las 
Cabanas". I looked more closely. The address was:

332
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:45,840
Las Cabanas, 232 Golden Drive. Telephone: 323.0313

333
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,240
I left the cafe and walked over to 
where I had parked the Chrysler.  

334
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,320
It wasn't time for lunch yet, so I decided 
to go and see what Las Cabanas was like.  

335
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,160
It took me nearly twenty minutes to drive there 
and another ten minutes to find somewhere to park.

336
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,480
Have you ever seen a night club in the 
daytime? It's a very depressing sight.  

337
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,760
At night, a nightclub seems wonderful. 
However, at a quarter to twelve in the morning,  

338
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,320
it looks old, empty and dirty. The man I met at 
Las Cabanas looked old, empty and dirty, too.

339
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,480
I rang the bell for five minutes 
before he answered the door.  

340
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,120
Even then, he didn't open the door itself. 
Instead, he opened a small window in the door.

341
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,160
'What do you want?' he asked. 'The club 
doesn't open until ten o'clock tonight.'

342
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,560
'I'm looking for someone,' I said, 
'someone called Benny Greep.'

343
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,320
'I don't know anyone called Benny Greep,' the 
man replied and started to shut the window.

344
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,160
'Wait a minute,' I said and pushed 
five dollars through the window.

345
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
'That's better,' the man said.

346
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,400
And he opened the door and let me in.

347
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,720
I followed him across the dance 
floor. The man was a cleaner.  

348
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,840
He picked up a brush and began to clean the floor.

349
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,880
'Do you know where I can find Benny 
Greep?' I asked the man again.

350
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,280
'If you come back tonight at ten 
o'clock, you'll find Benny Greep here,'  

351
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,080
the man said. 'Benny plays the drums in the band.'

352
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,640
I gave the man another five dollars.

353
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,360
'Where can I find Benny now?' I asked.

354
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The man picked up a piece of paper from 
the floor and wrote an address on it.

355
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,920
I took the paper and left immediately.

356
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,680
As I drove the grey Chrysler 
away from Las Cabanas,  

357
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,840
I looked at the address the cleaner had written:

358
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,800
5314 ARVIEDA STREET

359
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,080
WEST LOS ANGELES

360
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,600
5314 Arvieda Street was an 
old block of apartments.  

361
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,080
I gave the porter a couple of dollars and he 
told me which was Benny Greep's apartment. I  

362
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:47,200
walked up the narrow, dark stairs until I came to 
the fifth floor. I was looking for Apartment 507.

363
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,480
I knocked on the door of Apartment 
507 and waited. There was no answer,  

364
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,880
so I rang the bell. No answer. I knocked 
again, hard. There was still no answer.

365
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,840
I pushed against the door and it opened easily. 
I waited. There was no sound from the apartment,  

366
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:12,000
so I went in. The light was on and the curtains 
were drawn. The apartment was very small. There  

367
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,160
was one main room, which was used as the 
living-room, dining-room and bedroom.  

368
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,600
The room had two doors. One of the doors led 
into the kitchen and the other into the bathroom.

369
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,680
The main room was very untidy. The table 
was covered with dirty plates and glasses  

370
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,640
and there was a full ashtray lying on the 
floor. There was a strange smell in the room.

371
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,040
I looked into the kitchen. The 
kitchen was also dirty and untidy.  

372
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,480
I walked across to the 
bathroom and opened the door.

373
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,840
Benny Greep was in the bath. His left hand was 
hanging over the side of the bath. The hand had  

374
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,520
neatly cut nails, and there was a gold ring on one 
finger. The wrist was covered by a shirt-sleeve,  

375
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,080
which was rather dirty. I couldn't see the rest 
of the arm, because it was under the water.

376
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,960
Benny Greep's head was just out of the water. He 
had a handsome face and quite long, black hair.  

377
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,400
His eyes were wide open. The only other parts 
of his body out of the water were his feet.  

378
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,400
But I couldn't see his toes because he still had 
his shoes and socks on. The bath water was red.

379
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,160
I pulled out the plug in the bath, to let 
the water out. When the bath was empty,  

380
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,680
I looked at the dead man more closely. He had been 
dead for several hours. He had been shot in the  

381
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:33,840
chest and then pushed into the bath. I looked on 
the floor by the bath. There was blood there, too,  

382
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,800
and I was standing in it. I moved back and 
cleaned the blood off my shoes with some water.

383
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,600
Then I quickly looked round the main 
room again. The dead man's coat was  

384
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,680
lying on a chair and I felt in the 
pockets. I found a few dollars and  

385
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,320
a driving licence. The driving licence 
had a photograph of the dead man on it.  

386
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,440
The licence belonged to Benny Greep, 
and the address in the licence was 5314  

387
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:11,840
Arvieda Street, West Los Angeles. The dead 
man in the bath was definitely Benny Greep.
 
 

388
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,240
CHAPTER EIGHT

389
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,440
Arrested for Murder

390
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,720
I moved around the room and carefully cleaned 
everything I had touched. I didn't want to  

391
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,520
leave any fingerprints. There was nothing in the 
room to connect Benny Greep with Elaine Garfield.  

392
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,480
I picked up the telephone 
and asked for the police.

393
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,920
'I'm speaking from Apartment 507, 5314 Arivieda 
Street,' I said. 'There's a dead man in the bath.'

394
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,280
'Right,' said the policeman at the other 
end of the telephone. 'What's your name?'

395
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,040
I told him.

396
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,600
'Don't touch anything,' the policeman said,  

397
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,560
'and stay where you are. A police 
car will he there in a few minutes.'

398
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,880
I put down the phone and sat down to wait. Three 
minutes later, I heard the police car coming.  

399
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,680
The car stopped outside the building and I 
could hear heavy feet running up the stairs.

400
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,640
Two policemen walked into the apartment. 
They were both wearing ordinary clothes  

401
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,680
and looked hot and tired. One was about 
twenty-five years old, the other about forty.

402
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,520
The older policeman came up to me 
and showed me his police papers.

403
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
'Where's the body?' he asked.

404
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,400
I pointed to the bathroom. Both 
policemen went into the bathroom  

405
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,240
to have a look. The younger one 
came back first, shaking his head.

406
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,560
'All right,' said the younger 
policeman, 'why did you do it?'

407
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,840
'Do what?' I asked in surprise.

408
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,120
'Why did you kill your friend in 
the bath?' said the young policeman.

409
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,760
'He wasn't my friend,' I replied.

410
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,120
'I don't care if he was your friend or not,' said 
the policeman. 'Tell me why you killed, him.'

411
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,240
'I didn't kill him,' I said calmly.

412
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,600
'Then what are you doing here?' asked the 
older policeman, coming in from the bathroom.

413
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,440
'My name's Lenny Samuel,' I explained. 'I'm 
a private detective and I came here to talk  

414
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,800
to Benny Greep. The door was open and so I 
came in. I looked in the bathroom and I found  

415
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,600
the dead man in the bath, so I telephoned 
the police. The dead man is Benny Greep.'

416
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,080
'Why did you want to talk to Benny 
Greep?' the younger policeman asked.

417
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,520
'I'm sorry, I can't answer that,' I replied.

418
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,480
'Who are you working for?' 
asked the older policeman.

419
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,720
'I'm sorry, I can't answer that 
either,' I said. 'As far as I know,  

420
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,840
Benny Greep's death doesn't have anything 
to do with the person I'm working for.'

421
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,400
'Tell me who you are working for,' 
shouted the younger policeman angrily.

422
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,080
'Take it easy,' said the older policeman to 
the younger one. 'You stay here until the  

423
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,560
other police arrive. I'm going to take 
Mr Samuel down to the police station.'

424
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,520
I kept quiet and followed the older policeman 
out of the room and down the stairs.  

425
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,320
Outside the building, we got into my 
old Chrysler. The policeman drove.  

426
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,920
We were soon at the police station, where 
the policeman locked me in a small room.  

427
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,040
I sat down on a hard, wooden chair in 
the locked room and tried to sleep.

428
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,520
It was no use getting angry or 
upset at being arrested for murder.  

429
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,240
That is something you have to get used to, if you 
are a private detective. It happens all the time.

430
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,680
But I could not sleep. I was thinking about 
all the things which had happened since I had  

431
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:23,120
met Helen Garfield the day before. I couldn't 
sleep, because several things were worrying me.  

432
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,840
But I couldn't remember what those things were.
 
 

433
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,440
CHAPTER NINE

434
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,400
Sergeant Murphy

435
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,920
While I was in the police station, I remembered 
one of the things which was worrying me.  

436
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,480
How had Jo and his tall friend known that 
I was in Elaine Garfield's apartment?  

437
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,240
The porter at the Manson Building 
must have told the two men.  

438
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,000
I decided that I would go and talk to the 
porter when I left the police station.

439
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,120
I sat back in the chair and looked at my 
watch. The time was nearly four o'clock.

440
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,920
Then I remembered that Helen Garfield was coming  

441
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,520
to my office at five o'clock. I 
would not be there to meet her.

442
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,000
But there was something else that was 
worrying me. It wasn't anything important.  

443
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,440
It was quite a small thing. But 
I couldn't remember what it was.

444
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,080
Suddenly, the door opened and a policeman came in.

445
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,280
'Stand up,' shouted the policeman. 'Follow me.'

446
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,560
I stood up and followed the policeman 
out of the room and along a corridor.  

447
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,920
The policeman stopped, knocked 
on a door and opened it.

448
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,360
'Are you ready to see the private 
detective?' asked the policeman,  

449
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,800
as he put his head around the door.

450
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,360
Without waiting for an answer, the policeman 
opened the door wide and pushed me into the room.  

451
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,040
The policeman came into the room 
and closed the door behind him.

452
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,520
In the room, there was a man sitting behind a 
desk. He was completely bald - he had no hair  

453
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,160
at all. He was about fifty-five years 
old and his name was Sergeant Murphy.  

454
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,920
Sergeant Murphy had spent all his life in the 
police and he didn't like private detectives.

455
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,200
Sergeant Murphy sat looking at me. He looked at me 
for about five minutes, without saying anything.  

456
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,200
I was standing in front of his 
desk, looking straight back at him.  

457
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,640
The silence didn't worry me. 
In fact, I quite liked it.  

458
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,880
The silence was much nicer than questions about 
what I'd been doing in Benny Greep's apartment.

459
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,320
'What were you doing in Benny Greep's 
apartment?' asked Sergeant Murphy suddenly.

460
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,200
'I wanted to talk to him,' I replied.

461
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,040
'Why did you kill Benny Greep?' 
shouted Sergeant Murphy suddenly.

462
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,360
'I didn't kill him,' I replied,  

463
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,240
and I told Sergeant Murphy the same story that I 
had told the policemen in Benny Greep's apartment.

464
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,640
'I don't believe a word of what you've told me,' 
said the sergeant. 'Who are you working for?'

465
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,720
'I'm sorry,' I replied, 'I can't 
tell you who I'm working for.  

466
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,760
As far as I know, Benny Greep's death has nothing 
to do with me or with the person I'm working for.'

467
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,560
I stopped and looked at the sergeant. I 
knew that what I had just said wasn't true.  

468
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,960
In fact, I thought Benny Greep's death was 
connected with Elaine Garfield's disappearance.  

469
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,840
But I couldn't tell the police. Helen Garfield had  

470
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,880
said that she didn't want the police to 
know about her sister's disappearance.

471
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
Sergeant Murphy looked me straight in the eyes.

472
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:21,120
'I hate all private detectives,' he said slowly, 
'and you are the private detective that I hate  

473
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:26,480
the most. I don't think you are telling me the 
truth. I think you are hiding things from me.  

474
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,720
I think you know more about Benny 
Greep's death than you say you do.  

475
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,600
And you are going to tell me all you know - now.'

476
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,520
'I've already told you all 
I know,' I replied quietly.

477
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,840
Sergeant Murphy's face went red. The red colour 
went up until it covered all of his bald head.

478
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,720
'Don't try to play, games with 
me,' he shouted. 'Now get out.'

479
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,760
'Can I go home now?' I asked.

480
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
'No,' said Sergeant Murphy.

481
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,640
The sergeant told the policeman at the door to  

482
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,040
take me back to the small 
room and lock me up again.

483
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,160
I went with the policemen and didn't 
argue. I don't like arguing with policemen.  

484
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,000
When I was alone in the room again, I sat down. 
I tried to remember the other thing that had been  

485
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:25,840
worrying me earlier. Someone had said something 
important, but I could not remember what it was.
 
 

486
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,640
CHAPTER TEN

487
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,600
The Yellow Car

488
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,480
I looked at my watch. It was half past five. 
I was still at the police station. I'd seen  

489
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,840
Sergeant Murphy once more, during the afternoon. 
It hadn't been a pleasant meeting. I hadn't told  

490
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,640
the sergeant who I was working for. And I hadn't 
told him why I'd wanted to talk to Benny Greep.

491
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,320
Half past five. I wondered if Helen 
Garfield was waiting for me at my office.

492
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,480
Suddenly, the door of the room 
opened and Sergeant Murphy came in.

493
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,040
'Get out,' he said, 'I've decided to let 
you go. Now go before I change my mind.'

494
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,880
I went before Sergeant Murphy changed his mind.  

495
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,240
As I got my car out of the police garage, I 
wondered why Sergeant Murphy had let me go.

496
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,160
As I drove away from the police station, 
I noticed a small yellow car behind me.  

497
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,880
A minute later, I looked in the mirror again. 
The small yellow car was still behind me.  

498
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,640
I drove a little faster and 
then suddenly turned right  

499
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,120
up a narrow street. At the end of the narrow 
street, I turned left and then left again.  

500
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,040
Soon, I was back on the main road. I looked in the 
mirror. The yellow car was still right behind me.

501
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,680
So that was why Sergeant Murphy had let me go. The 
sergeant had ordered some policemen to follow me.  

502
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,000
They were going to watch what I did and who I met.

503
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,800
I drove straight back to the 
office. As I parked the car outside,  

504
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,760
I noticed the yellow car had stopped across 
the road. I ran up the stairs and into my  

505
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,640
office. The door to the outer room was 
open, as usual, but the room was empty.

506
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,280
Helen Garfield wasn't, there. But 
there was a letter on the table,  

507
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,880
on top of the magazines. I picked 
the letter up and read it.
 
 

508
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Dear Mr. Samuel,

509
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,440
I came here at five o'clock 
and waited but you didn't  

510
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,240
come. I must see you urgently. Meet 
me at has Cabanas at 11.30 tonight.

511
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,920
Helen Garfield.
 
 

512
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,880
I put the letter in my pocket and looked 
at my watch. It was just after six o'clock.  

513
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,560
I had five and a half hours before 
the meeting with Helen Garfield.  

514
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,760
There was plenty of time to go to the 
Mansion Building and talk to the porter.  

515
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,760
I got into the Chrysler and drove 
off towards the Mansion Building.  

516
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,280
The small yellow car was still following me. As 
I drove, I thought about Helen Garfield's letter.

517
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,600
'Why does she want to meet me 
at Las Cabanas?' I asked myself.  

518
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,640
'In fact, how does she know about Las Cabanas 
at all? She says that she lives in New York.'

519
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,520
I would have to ask Miss Helen Garfield 
a few questions, the next time I saw her.

520
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,560
But the most important thing now was to get away 
from the yellow car, which was still following me.  

521
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:14,160
I was going to the building where Elaine Garfield 
lived and I didn't want the police to know.

522
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,040
There were two men in the yellow car. I 
turned right and the yellow car followed.  

523
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,120
I stopped and the yellow car stopped. I turned the 
Chrysler around and the yellow car turned around.  

524
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,000
I tried to drive faster than the yellow car, 
but the Chrysler was too old and too slow.

525
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,520
I slowed down and waited until I was near the 
next traffic lights. Then, just as the lights  

526
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,480
were changing from green to red, I drove 
across them. The yellow car was too late.  

527
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,520
The lights were now red. But that didn't stop 
the car. It drove straight past the red light.

528
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,800
Then, as I looked angrily in my mirror, 
something happened which made me laugh.  

529
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,640
A policeman on a motorbike 
drove after the yellow car.  

530
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,960
The policeman made the driver stop, 
because he had driven past the red light.

531
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,080
I drove away as fast as possible. In my mirror, I 
could see the driver inside the car arguing with  

532
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,560
the policeman on the motorbike. It was the 
funniest sight I had seen for a long time.  

533
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,560
I drove on towards the Manson 
Building, happy to have escaped.  

534
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:23,840
I may even have sung a little, 
because I was feeling so good.
 
 

535
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,360
CHAPTER ELEVEN

536
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,280
A Short Visit to the Manson Building

537
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,200
As I was driving happily towards the 
Manson Building, I had a surprise.  

538
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,960
I looked in the mirror. The yellow 
car was coming up fast behind me.

539
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,080
I drove as fast as I could, but the 
yellow car got closer and closer.  

540
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,840
Just then, a dog ran across the 
road, in front of the Chrysler.  

541
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:59,120
I braked hard and the tyres screamed as the 
Chrysler stopped suddenly to avoid the dog.  

542
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,840
Then there was the scream of more tyres as 
the driver of the yellow car tried to stop.

543
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:09,680
There was a loud crash and a bang, as the small 
yellow car ran right into the back of my big,  

544
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,600
old, grey Chrysler. The two men 
in the yellow car weren't hurt,  

545
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,280
but their car was badly damaged at the front. 
Oil and water were running out onto the road.  

546
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,080
The old Chrysler was not damaged at all. I 
got out and walked back to the yellow car.

547
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,080
'You ought to be more careful,' I said to the 
driver. 'You were driving very dangerously.  

548
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,000
It's lucky for you that my 
car isn't badly damaged.'

549
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,200
'But...but...,' the driver began to 
say, but I did not wait to listen.

550
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,600
I ran back to the Chrysler, jumped 
in and drove on. The last I saw  

551
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,560
of the yellow car was the two men 
pushing it to the side of the road.

552
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,840
I was soon at the Manson Building and I 
went into the hall, to look for the porter.  

553
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,720
I couldn't see him anywhere. Then I noticed 
a door with a sign on it saying "Porter".  

554
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,640
I knocked quietly, but there was no answer. I 
opened the door slowly and looked into the room.

555
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,400
The porter was sitting at his desk, asleep. 
His feet were on the desk and he was lying  

556
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,080
back in his chair. I walked quickly and 
quietly into the room and closed the door.  

557
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,960
I went up to the desk and noticed a 
piece of paper lying by the telephone.  

558
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,400
There was a telephone number 
written on the paper - 3230313.

559
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,360
'Las Cabanas,' I said to myself. 'That's 
the telephone number of the nightclub.'

560
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Without waking the porter, I left the room. 
I had found out what I wanted to know.  

561
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,280
The two men who had hit me on the head 
had probably come from Las Cabanas.  

562
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,720
The porter must have telephoned them 
when I went up to Elaine Garfield's flat.

563
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:51,520
I was now very interested in Las Cabanas. Elaine 
Garfield used to go dancing there with Suzy.  

564
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,120
Benny Greep worked there before 
he was killed. Helen Garfield  

565
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,720
wanted to meet me there at half 
past eleven. And now the porter  

566
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,000
and the two men who had hit me on the 
head were connected with Las Cabanas.

567
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,160
I went home, washed, changed and had a meal.  

568
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,080
At eleven o'clock, I went out 
again. I was going to Las Cabanas.

569
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,680
There were lots of cars parked outside and I had 
to leave the Chrysler quite a long way away from  

570
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:21,600
the nightclub. As I walked up to the entrance 
of Las Cabanas, it started to rain heavily.  

571
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,000
I knocked on the door and the little window 
in the door opened. A face looked at me for a  

572
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,000
minute. Then the door opened and I went in. 
The club no longer looked empty and dirty.  

573
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Soft lights and sweet music had changed 
the appearance of the club completely.  

574
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,120
I stood and looked around. There was a small 
dance floor, on which a few people were dancing.

575
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,640
The band was small and not very good. There 
was a new drummer instead of Benny Greep.  

576
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,040
Around the dance floor, several groups 
of people were sitting round low tables.  

577
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,040
To the right of the dance floor, there 
were more tables where people were eating.  

578
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,720
There were two doors behind the 
tables, which led into the kitchen.  

579
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:07,840
I sat down at a table by the dance floor, in 
the darkest part of the room, and waited.
 
 

580
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,840
CHAPTER TWELVE

581
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,640
Las Cabanas

582
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,200
Exactly at eleven thirty, Helen Garfield came 
into the nightclub. She was looking as beautiful  

583
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,880
as ever, but seemed to be a little worried. Her 
blue eyes looked around the room until she saw me.  

584
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,120
Then, with a little smile, she 
walked up and sat down at the table.  

585
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,320
She sat next to me, with 
her back to the dance floor.  

586
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,520
She was carrying a bag, which she put on the floor 
beside her. The smile disappeared from her face.

587
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,920
'Where were you this afternoon, Mr Samuel?' she 
said sharply. 'I'm paying you fifty dollars a day.  

588
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,120
In return for that money, I 
want you to do what I tell you.  

589
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,920
Now why weren't you at your office 
this afternoon at five o'clock?'

590
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,840
I took a deep breath.

591
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,560
'Well, Miss Garfield,'  

592
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,080
I said, 'it's a long story. Let's have 
a drink and I'll tell you all about it.'

593
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,160
A waiter came over and I ordered some drinks.

594
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,920
When the waiter had gone, the beautiful, blonde 
girl said, 'Come on, Mr Samuel, tell me.'

595
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,400
'OK,' I said, 'but stop calling me Mr Samuel. 
Call me Len - all my friends call me Len.'

596
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,160
'I'm not a friend of yours, Mr Samuel,' 
the blonde girl said, in a voice like ice.  

597
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,320
'I'm paying you a lot of money to work for me.'

598
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,840
'Fifty dollars a day doesn't allow you 
to be rude to me,' I replied quietly.  

599
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,680
'In the last twenty four hours, I've been 
hit on the head and suspected of murder.'

600
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,640
'What do you mean?' the girl said, 
and leant towards me. 'Murder?'

601
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,000
Just then, the waiter brought the drinks 
and we sat in silence until he had gone.  

602
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,560
Then I told Helen Garfield about my visit to 
her sister's apartment in the Manson Building.  

603
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,120
I told her about the two men who had caught 
me there. Helen Garfield listened in silence.

604
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,000
'Do you like the band, Miss Garfield?' I asked.

605
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,400
'I didn't come here to talk about the 
band,' the blonde girl said angrily.

606
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,760
'The band has got a new drummer tonight,' I said,  

607
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,440
'because I found the old drummer 
dead in his bath this morning.'

608
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,600
The blonde girl turned around 
quickly to look at the band.  

609
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,720
She said something to herself 
which I didn't hear. She lifted  

610
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,680
her right hand and started stroking her 
hair. She looked sad and very worried.

611
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:43,280
'What...what was the drummer ...the 
dead man's name?' Helen Garfield asked.

612
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,280
'Greep,' I said, 'Benny Greep. I don't 
suppose that you know Benny Greep, do you?'

613
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,520
Helen Garfield shook her head.

614
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,840
'No,' she said.

615
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,360
I told her what had happened 
at the police station.  

616
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,640
Then I told her about the policemen 
who had followed me in a yellow car.

617
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,000
'Do you think they're still 
following you?' the blonde  

618
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,320
girl asked quickly and looked around the club.

619
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,720
I told her how I had got away from the yellow car.

620
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,560
'Now, Miss Garfield,' I continued, 'it's time 
for me to ask you a few questions. There are  

621
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,880
some things about your sister's disappearance 
which worry me. I want to ask you about them.'

622
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,000
'All right,' she said, 'but I don't 
think I can help you. I don't know much  

623
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,840
about Elaine's life here. I don't know 
very much about Los Angeles, either.'

624
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,160
I sat back in my chair and 
looked at her. This beautiful,  

625
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,600
blonde girl was paying me fifty 
dollars a day to find her sister.  

626
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:42,320
I liked what I saw. Then, very quietly, I 
began to ask Helen Garfield some questions.

627
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,640
'You don't know Los Angeles very well?' I began.

628
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,520
'That's right,' the girl replied.

629
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,280
'But you were able to find out 
where Elaine worked,' I continued.  

630
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,680
'And you went to Myer and Myer last Tuesday, 
to ask if they knew anything about Elaine.'

631
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,840
'Yes,' the girl said, looking at me closely.

632
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,320
'Who did you speak to at Myer 
and Myer?' I asked. 'Suzy?'

633
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,280
'No,' the girl said, 'I spoke to Mr Myer.'

634
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,840
'I want to ask you something else,' I 
said. 'When I went to Elaine's flat,  

635
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,960
I noticed something unusual. There were 
very few clothes in the wardrobe. It seems  

636
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,840
your sister planned her disappearance quite 
carefully. She had taken her clothes with her.'

637
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,480
'I see,' the girl said and 
looked around the nightclub.

638
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,960
I waited until she looked back at me.

639
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,840
'Do you like it here?' I asked.

640
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,240
'Yes,' she said.

641
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,240
'I like it, too,' I said, 'But there's 
something else which is worrying me.  

642
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,320
Do you mind if I ask you one more question?'

643
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,120
'Not at all,' the girl said.

644
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,600
'Well,' I began, 'I've been wondering why you 
asked me to meet you here, at Las Cabanas.'

645
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,360
Helen Garfield pushed back her chair and stood up.

646
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,160
'Would you please excuse 
me for a minute?' she said.

647
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,640
She picked her bag up from the floor and 
walked over towards the ladies' toilet,  

648
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,760
which was near the entrance.

649
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,960
'Would you like another 
drink?' I shouted after her.

650
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,960
'Yes, please,' she shouted back, over 
her shoulder. I ordered two more drinks  

651
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:29,840
and sat back in my chair. I looked around 
the nightclub. It was almost midnight.
 
 

652
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,640
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

653
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,320
Helen Garfield Leaves

654
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,240
I sat by the dance floor in Las Cabanas, waiting 
for Helen Garfield to come back from the toilet.  

655
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,320
I was waiting for her to answer my 
question. I wanted to know why she  

656
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,160
had asked me to meet her here. I looked 
around at the people who were dancing.

657
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,240
On the other side of the dance floor, 
I could see people sitting eating at  

658
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:58,000
the tables. Waiters were carrying food in and 
out of the two doors leading to the kitchen.

659
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,280
I looked at my watch again. 
It was five past twelve.  

660
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,880
Helen Garfield was taking a long time. I 
finished my drink and ordered another one.

661
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,760
At ten past twelve, I got up and 
walked over towards the entrance.  

662
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,320
There was a man standing by the front door of 
the nightclub. I asked him if he had seen Helen.

663
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,880
'The beautiful blonde with 
blue eyes?' the man asked.

664
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,240
'Yes,' I said.

665
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,480
'She left nearly a quarter of 
an hour ago,' said the man.

666
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,800
'Are you sure?' I asked.

667
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,560
'Yes,' the man replied. 'She 
asked me to get her a taxi.'

668
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,200
'Did you hear her give the taxi 
driver an address?' I asked quickly.

669
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,400
The man shook his head.

670
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,280
'No,' he said, 'I'm sorry.'

671
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,560
I thanked the man and walked back to my seat.

672
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,120
Why did Helen Garfield leave 
without telling me? I asked myself.  

673
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,080
Perhaps some of the questions 
that I asked made her angry.

674
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:57,520
Just then, I looked up and saw a man 
walking across the dance floor towards me.  

675
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:03,680
I recognised the man. He was short, with red 
hair. He was looking at me and smiling in a  

676
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,200
rather unfriendly way. It was Jo - one of the men 
who had found me in Elaine Garfield's apartment.

677
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,880
I decided to leave. I stood up and started to 
walk towards the door. I didn't want to meet  

678
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,760
Jo again. As I walked towards the door, 
I thought that I heard someone shouting.

679
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,400
'Excuse me, sir,' said a voice.

680
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,400
I didn't stop or look around. 
Then I heard the voice again.

681
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,480
'Excuse me, sir. You haven't paid your bill.'

682
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,880
I had forgotten to pay for the 
drinks. The waiter came running  

683
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,080
up to me and I quickly took out ten 
dollars and gave them to the waiter.

684
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,440
'You can keep the change,' I 
said as I gave him the money.ну

685
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,280
Without waiting for a reply, I 
turned and hurried towards the door.

686
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,440
Then I heard the waiter's voice again.

687
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,880
'Excuse me, sir, excuse me, sir,' he said.

688
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,800
I stopped and turned around. 
The waiter came up to me.

689
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,120
'Excuse me, sir, ten dollars is not enough,'  

690
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,160
he said, 'The price of your 
drinks is twelve dollars.'

691
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,840
'Las Cabanas is very expensive,' I said,  

692
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,840
as I gave the waiter another five 
dollars. 'Now, you can keep the change.'

693
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,600
Then I stopped thinking about money. 
Jo was walking quickly towards me.  

694
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,960
I turned around and ran towards 
the door as fast as I could.  

695
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,760
I got to the door and was just about to leave 
Las Cabanas. I was happy because I had escaped.

696
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,960
Then I got a surprise. There, 
standing by the door of the nightclub,  

697
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,880
was Jo's tall friend. It was the same man who had 
hit me on the head in Miss Garfield's apartment.  

698
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:45,840
The tall man had seen me coming and had moved 
in front of the door. Now, I couldn't get out.
 
 

699
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,000
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

700
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,560
The Fight

701
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,240
I stopped and looked behind me. Jo was closer now 
and the smile on his face looked very unfriendly.  

702
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,560
I was caught. I could not go out of 
the door and Jo was right behind me.

703
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,360
I turned around quickly and ran towards 
Jo. Before he knew what I was doing,  

704
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,960
I put my arms around him and started dancing. He 
was very surprised and tried to pull away from me.  

705
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,480
But he couldn't fight properly. He was 
afraid that the other people would notice.

706
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,440
I looked over my shoulder and saw the tall man  

707
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,320
standing helplessly on the 
side of the dance floor.  

708
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,720
I pushed Jo into the middle of the dance floor, 
where there were lots of other people dancing.

709
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:35,520
Then I felt something sharp touching my back. It 
was a knife. 'Stop trying to be funny, Samuel,'  

710
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,640
said Jo angrily. 'Stop dancing and go over to 
the door or else I'll push this knife into you.'

711
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,200
We were right in the middle of the dance 
floor and a long way from the tall man.  

712
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:51,040
Jo was holding a knife against my back. Some of 
the other people around us had stopped dancing.  

713
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,400
They were staring in surprise at the 
sight of two men dancing together.

714
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,800
I lifted my foot and kicked 
Jo's leg as hard as I could.  

715
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,760
He gave a cry of pain and fell to the floor. 
I looked around to see where I could run to.  

716
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,800
Jo's tall friend was coming 
through the dancers towards me.

717
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,080
I turned around and ran off the 
dance floor. I looked back over  

718
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,360
my shoulder and saw that both Jo 
and his friend were following me.

719
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,720
I ran between the tables where people were 
eating. The floor was slippery and I fell over.  

720
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,840
As I fell, I knocked over a table and the 
plates of food and glasses fell on top of me.

721
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,200
I got up quickly and ran out through 
one of the doors into the kitchen.  

722
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,200
Then I stopped and counted to five.

723
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,640
As Jo and his tall friend 
were coming towards the door,  

724
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,840
I pushed the door closed as hard as I could. There 
was a loud bang as the men ran into the door.

725
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:42,960
I smiled and turned round. But 
I did not smile for very long.  

726
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,960
Three cooks were coming towards me 
with big kitchen knives in their hands.

727
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,920
I looked at the cooks and at 
the knives they were holding.  

728
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,640
I thought about running towards 
them and trying to fight them.  

729
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,880
I decided that it would be a stupid idea 
to try and fight three big men with knives.

730
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,720
To my left, there was a very big saucepan 
full of boiling soup on the stove. I picked  

731
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:07,760
it up and threw it at the cooks. There were loud 
cries of pain as the hot soup hit the three men.

732
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,560
Just then, the door opened behind me.  

733
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,880
Jo and his tall friend stood in the 
doorway, and the tall man was holding a gun.

734
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,440
There was a loud bang as the gun went off. 
The bang was followed by a scream of pain  

735
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,280
from one of the cooks, because the tall 
man had shot him in the foot by mistake.

736
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,120
I quickly picked up a large pile of dirty plates 
and threw them at Jo. He saw the plates coming and  

737
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:34,960
he tried to move away. As he moved, he slipped on 
the floor and fell onto a pile of broken plates.

738
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,880
Without waiting, I ran to a door at the 
back of the kitchen. The door was locked  

739
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,160
and I banged against the door with my shoulder. 
The lock broke easily and I pushed the door open.  

740
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,960
As I ran out into the dark street, I could still 
hear the shouts and cries coming from the Club.

741
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,400
I came to the Chrysler and 
bent over to open the door.  

742
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,920
Just then, there was a noise behind me. I 
turned around and saw a man with his arm raised.  

743
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:15,840
Then I felt a terrible pain in my head. Everything 
went black. I fell to the ground, unconscious.
 
 

744
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,560
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

745
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,440
The Police Station

746
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,400
'Feeling better now?' asked a voice.

747
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,200
I opened my eyes and looked around 
me. I didn't know where I was.  

748
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,520
I was lying on something hard and 
there was a bright light on my eyes.

749
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,320
'Where am I?' I asked.

750
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,200
Then I realised where I was. 
I recognised the grey walls,  

751
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:48,320
the hard furniture and the bright electric 
lights. I was in the police station again.

752
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,920
'Feeling better now?' the voice repeated.

753
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,640
I looked at the policeman who was talking to me.

754
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:01,520
'Yes,' I said very slowly, 'but my head 
feels as if it is breaking in half.'

755
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,800
'You're lucky to be alive,' said 
the policeman. 'A police car found  

756
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,040
you lying in the middle of the road on 
Golden Drive. You would have been hit  

757
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,360
by passing cars - and probably killed, 
if the police car hadn't found you.'

758
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,680
I thought for a moment. I wasn't 
sure how much the police knew.  

759
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,040
I didn't want to tell the police 
anything they did not already know.

760
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:29,600
'Yes, I was lucky,' I said. 'By the way, 
what was a police car doing on Golden Drive?'

761
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,520
'Oh,' said the policeman, 'there was a big 
fight at a nightclub called Las Cabanas.  

762
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,280
We had a telephone call to say that 
there was a madman in the club.  

763
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,480
The madman was breaking up all the furniture. 
A police car was sent to the nightclub,  

764
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,760
but the madman escaped before the police arrived. 
The police car was returning when it found you  

765
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,720
lying in the middle of the road. You were very 
lucky. The car nearly ran right over you.'

766
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,240
I smiled.

767
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,800
'I don't feel very lucky,' I 
replied. 'In fact, I feel terrible.'

768
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,000
'Never mind,' said the policeman. 'Can you walk?'

769
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,840
I stood up and walked a few steps. My 
head hurt, but otherwise I felt all right.

770
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,480
'Yes,' I said, 'I can walk.'

771
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,120
'Good,' the policeman said, 'let's 
walk along the corridor, then,  

772
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,040
and have a talk with a friend of yours.'

773
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,920
We went along the corridor. The 
policeman stopped at a door and  

774
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,000
knocked. There was a shout from inside the 
room and the policeman opened the door.  

775
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:33,200
I walked into the room and the policeman followed. 
He shut the door and stood in front of it.

776
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,440
There was only one desk in the 
room and behind the desk was a man.  

777
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,240
He was bald. It was my 'old 
friend', Sergeant Murphy.

778
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,760
'Hello, Sergeant Murphy,' I said, trying 
to smile. 'How are you feeling tonight?'

779
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,800
Sergeant Murphy didn't smile back at me.

780
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,920
'Are you trying to be funny?' he asked.  

781
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,280
'It isn't night, it's morning. 
You've been unconscious all night.'

782
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,600
'Oh,' I said.

783
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:07,120
'Now,' said Sergeant Murphy, 'let's begin. I want 
you to tell me why you were lying, unconscious,  

784
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:12,400
in the middle of Golden Drive at half past twelve 
last night. You were a danger to the traffic.'

785
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,320
'I thought that the traffic was a danger to me,' 
I replied. But the sergeant didn't even smile.

786
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,640
'I'm waiting for you to tell me 
what happened,' said the sergeant.

787
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,720
'Nothing much happened,' I began, 'I spent 
part of the evening at Las Cabanas and left  

788
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:34,080
just before midnight. I walked back to my 
car. Just as I was about to get into the car,  

789
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,040
someone hit me over the head. 
That's the last I remember.

790
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,440
'This policeman,' and I pointed 
to the one standing by the door,  

791
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,240
'told me that I had been found in the middle 
of the road. Someone must have put me there.'

792
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,840
Sergeant Murphy smiled.

793
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,280
'Yes,' he said, 'someone who wanted to 
kill you put you in the middle of the road.  

794
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,920
Someone was hoping that a car 
would hit you and kill you.'

795
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,640
I smiled back at the sergeant.

796
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,880
'Can you think of anyone who would want 
to kill you?' the sergeant asked me.

797
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:13,840
'Oh, yes,' I replied, 'hundreds of people would 
like to kill me, including a few policemen.'
 
 

798
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,480
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

799
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,080
Tell Me the Truth

800
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,520
Did you leave Las Cabanas before 
midnight?' asked Sergeant Murphy.

801
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:35,440
'That's right,' I replied, 'I left 
the nightclub just before twelve.'

802
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:42,160
'So you weren't at Las Cabanas when the big fight 
started, just after twelve?' asked the sergeant.

803
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,960
'Big fight?' I said, trying to sound surprised.

804
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:50,960
'Don't sound so surprised,' said Sergeant 
Murphy angrily. 'We received a telephone  

805
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,120
call from the owner of Las Cabanas. He 
said that just after midnight last night,  

806
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:00,960
a tall man with brown hair and brown eyes, called 
Lenny Samuel, attacked two of the people at the  

807
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,520
club. The owner of the club said that you 
'then attacked and injured three cooks. Then  

808
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,880
you broke over one hundred plates and a table, 
and ruined food worth several hundred dollars.'

809
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,040
I didn't say anything. I could 
not think of anything to say.

810
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,680
'Did you really do all that?'  

811
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:24,240
Sergeant Murphy asked, in a different voice. 
The Sergeant sounded both surprised and pleased.  

812
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,880
'Did you really do all that on your 
own, or did you have men to help you?'

813
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,720
'I did it all on my own,' I said, 
beginning to feel a little proud of myself.

814
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,600
'Do you know that you could go to prison 
for six months for what you did last night?'  

815
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,520
the sergeant asked. He was laughing as he said it.

816
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,000
I wasn't laughing. I couldn't see 
anything funny about six months in prison.

817
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,840
'Look,' Sergeant Murphy said, 'I'm not stupid.'

818
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,680
I agreed with the sergeant that he was not stupid.

819
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:01,840
'I'm not stupid,' Sergeant Murphy repeated, 'and 
I know why you were at Las Cabanas last night.  

820
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:05,840
Benny Greep used to work there and 
you went to find out about his death.'

821
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,680
I agreed with the sergeant again. 
It seemed the best thing to do.

822
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:15,520
'Now,' Sergeant Murphy said slowly, 
'I'm interested in Las Cabanas.  

823
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:21,200
The club is owned by people who are criminals. 
But we can't prove that they have broken the law.  

824
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:28,240
I'm also interested in Benny Creep's murder. Now, 
what I suggest is this. Tell me all you know about  

825
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:33,920
Las Cabanas and Benny Greep and I will let you 
go. If you tell me all you know, you won't go to  

826
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,960
prison for the fight at the nightclub. But I want 
the truth, not the lies you told me yesterday.'

827
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,200
I took a deep breath and started 
to tell the sergeant what I knew.  

828
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:47,360
I told him about everything 
except Elaine Garfield.  

829
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:51,760
I wasn't sure how closely Elaine Garfield 
was connected with Benny Creep's death. So,  

830
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,960
I told the sergeant that Helen Garfield, from New 
York, had asked me to find out about Las Cabanas.

831
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:03,040
Sergeant Murphy asked me for Helen Garfield's 
address in New York and I said I didn't know it.  

832
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:07,840
Then the sergeant asked me where Helen Garfield 
was staying in Los Angeles. I said I didn't know.

833
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,920
I told Sergeant Murphy all 
that I knew about Benny Greep,  

834
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:17,200
except that the drummer had known Elaine Garfield. 
Then I asked him about the two men in the yellow  

835
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:22,240
car, who had followed me. The sergeant smiled 
and said that the two men were policemen.  

836
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,520
Finally, I told him about 
the fight at Las Cabanas.

837
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,160
Sergeant Murphy listened to everything. 
When I had finished my story,  

838
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,240
he looked at me in silence for a few moments.

839
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,800
'Right, Samuel, I hope that 
you've told me the truth,  

840
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:41,040
and all the truth. If you've been telling 
me more lies, I'll make sure that you go  

841
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:45,600
to prison for six months, because of the 
fight at Las Cabanas. Now, you can go.'

842
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,280
I stood up.

843
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,320
'Thank you,' I said, with a smile.

844
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:56,080
Sit down, he said, 'and listen. You 
can go. But you must promise to tell  

845
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:59,920
me anything you find out about Las 
Cabanas and about Benny Greep.'

846
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,880
'I promise,' I said quickly and stood up.

847
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:09,200
Wait a minute, said Sergeant Murphy. 'I've one 
more thing to tell you. I'm going to telephone  

848
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:14,400
the New York police. I'm going to ask them to 
find out all they can about Helen Garfield.  

849
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,640
If the police in New York discover that 
you've told me lies about Helen Garfield,  

850
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,200
you will be in very serious trouble.'

851
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,200
I told the sergeant not to 
worry and thanked him very much.

852
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,160
I left the police station feeling very 
happy because Sergeant Murphy had let me go.  

853
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:39,840
I called a taxi and went out to 
Golden Drive to get the Chrysler.
 
 

854
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,840
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

855
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,800
Telephone Calls

856
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,360
I drove the Chrysler back to the 
office and walked up the stairs.

857
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:59,200
The office looked just the same. 
There were no letters for me.  

858
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,600
I went down to the cafe and had a 
late breakfast. As I drank my coffee,  

859
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:08,240
I thought about some of the things Helen Garfield 
had told me at Las Cabanas before the fight.

860
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,880
I decided to check one of the things 
immediately and walked over to the telephone.  

861
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:18,080
I opened the telephone book and looked under 
'M' until I found the telephone number of  

862
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,840
Myer and Myer. I picked up the 
telephone and dialled the number.

863
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:27,920
'Myer and Myer, good morning,' said a 
voice which I recognised. 'Can I help you?'

864
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,320
'Hello, Suzy,' I said, 'this is 
Len Samuel. Do you remember me?'

865
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,840
'Of course I remember you,' said Suzy.

866
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,680
'Did your boyfriend win his boxing 
match on television?' I asked.

867
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,320
'No,' Suzy replied, 'and anyway, 
he's not my boyfriend any more.'

868
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:50,080
'Really,' I said happily, thinking that perhaps 
I could ask Suzy to go for a drink with me.

869
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:55,840
'Yes,' Suzy said, 'the boxer had a fight with 
my new boyfriend outside my house last night.'

870
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,400
'And who won?' I asked.

871
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,560
'My new boyfriend,' replied Suzy.

872
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,480
'Oh,' I said sadly, 'and what 
does your new boyfriend do?'

873
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:10,960
'My new boyfriend's a weight lifter.' Suzy 
replied. 'He lifts big weights in competitions.'

874
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,080
I was about to say goodbye. Then I remembered 
that I had not telephoned to speak to,  

875
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,720
Suzy. I wanted to speak to her boss, Mr Myer.

876
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,920
'Can I speak to Mr Myer please, Suzy?' I asked.

877
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,880
'Right,' Suzy said, 'I'll put 
you through to Mr Myer. Goodbye.'

878
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,880
There was a pause and then 
I heard Mr Myer's voice.

879
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,840
'Hello, Myer speaking.'

880
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,840
'Good morning Mr Myer,' I said, in a 
deep voice. I had put my handkerchief  

881
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,200
over the telephone, so that Mr 
Myer would not know my voice.

882
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,800
'This is the police,' I said, 
'Sergeant Murphy speaking.'

883
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,520
I pretended to be Sergeant Murphy so 
that Mr Myer would answer my questions.

884
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,840
'Good morning,' said Mr Myer. 
'What do you want to ask me about?'

885
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:02,640
'It's about a girl who works for you,' I said. 
'Her name is Elaine Garfield. She has disappeared  

886
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:07,920
and we are trying to find her. Elaine's sister, 
Helen, came to see you last Tuesday, didn't she?'

887
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:14,880
'No,' said Mr Myer, 'Elaine's sister didn't come 
to see me last Tuesday. I didn't know that Elaine  

888
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,320
had a sister, until a private detective told me. 
He said that Elaine's sister was called Helen.'

889
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:26,080
The telephone line was very bad and it was 
difficult for me to hear what Mr Myer was saying.

890
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,200
'What did you say?' I asked.

891
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,880
'I said that Elaine's sister was called Helen,'  

892
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,040
replied Mr Myer. 'The names 
are very similar, aren't they?'

893
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,840
Thank you very much, Mr Myer,' I 
said and put the telephone down.

894
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:48,640
Mr Myer was right. The names Helen 
and Elaine were very similar. Elaine  

895
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,680
Garfield had disappeared. And so far, I was 
the only person who had met Helen Garfield.

896
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,440
I left the cafe and walked back up to my office.  

897
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,720
As I climbed the stairs, I 
could hear my telephone ringing.  

898
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:06,240
I didn't hurry. I walked slowly along the corridor 
into my office, and answered the telephone.

899
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:13,680
'Is that Samuel?' a voice said. I 
recognised the voice at once. It was Jo.

900
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,320
'Yes,' I said, 'this is Len Samuel.'

901
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:22,480
'Listen, Samuel,' Jo said, 'we want Elaine 
Garfield and we think you know where she  

902
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:27,520
is. We are coming to your office to 
see you. Wait for us. Don't go out.'

903
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:33,680
'But I ...' I started, but it was too 
late. Jo had put the telephone down.

904
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,720
I sat down at my desk sadly.

905
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,680
'Now what's going to happen?' I thought.  

906
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:44,560
'Jo and his friend will come to see me. They'll 
ask me if I know where Elaine Garfield is.  

907
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,960
But I don't know where she is. I wonder 
if they will believe me when I tell them.'

908
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,400
The telephone rang again. I picked it up.

909
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,640
'Hello,' I said.

910
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,040
'Hello, Samuel,' said a familiar voice.

911
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,840
'Hello, Sergeant Murphy,' I 
replied, trying to sound pleased.

912
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,360
'We've just telephoned New 
York,' the sergeant said angrily,  

913
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:10,800
'and the New York police were very helpful. The 
New York police told us that there is no such  

914
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:16,400
person as Helen Garfield. Helen Garfield does 
not exist. There is no one living in New York  

915
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:22,000
called Helen Garfield. You were lying when you 
told me that you were working for Helen Garfield.'

916
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,320
'But...' I started.

917
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:28,880
'Now, listen,' the sergeant interrupted, 
'I am sending a police car round to your  

918
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,400
office. I want to see you. Wait 
for the police car. Don't go out.'

919
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:42,400
The sergeant put down the telephone and I sat back 
in my chair. I was worried. What would happen now?  

920
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:49,120
Jo was coming to see me and so was a policeman. I 
tried to think of what I would say to them both.  

921
01:09:49,120 --> 01:10:01,840
I hoped that the policeman and Jo 
would not arrive at the same time.
 
 

922
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,800
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

923
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,120
I Find Elaine Garfield

924
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,320
The telephone rang again. I was afraid to answer 
it. The telephone continued ringing. Finally,  

925
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,360
I did answer it.

926
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,440
'Hello,' I said.

927
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:27,120
'Is that Mr Samuel?' asked a voice. It was 
Helen Garfield. 'Yes, Miss Garfield,' I replied,  

928
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:32,400
'this is Len Samuel speaking.' 'I 
must see you,' said Helen Garfield.

929
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,960
'Well, I would like to talk 
to you, too, Miss Garfield,'  

930
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,520
I said slowly. 'I think there are a lot 
of things you and I must talk about.'

931
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:47,680
'Right,' the girl said, 'meet me at the 
"Seventh Mann" cafe in five minutes.  

932
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,520
Do you know where the cafe is? It's 
about half a mile from your office.'

933
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,760
'I know the "Seventh Man", 'I replied, 
'but I can't meet you in five minutes,  

934
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,200
because I'm expecting visitors.'

935
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,560
'You must come at once, Mr Samuel,' she said.

936
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,480
'But...' I began.

937
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:08,640
It was too late. Helen Garfield had put her 
telephone down. I got up from the chair and  

938
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:15,600
walked to the door. I decided to go and meet Helen 
Garfield. Both Jo and Sergeant Murphy had told me  

939
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:21,040
not to go out. But I decided I would rather 
talk to Helen Garfield than to the policeman  

940
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:25,840
or to Jo. If Jo and the policeman came when 
I was out, they could talk to each other.

941
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,320
I left the building and drove the 
Chrysler down the road. I was very lucky,  

942
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:35,120
because I was able to park right outside 
the "Seventh Mann". I walked into the cafe.

943
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,880
Helen Garfield was sitting at a table in the 
comer. I walked over and sat down beside her.  

944
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:45,840
I asked the waiter for a cup of coffee. I 
drank the coffee without saying anything.  

945
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,800
Then I put the cup down and looked at the 
beautiful, blonde girl sitting beside me.

946
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:57,520
'Miss Garfield,' I said, you are a very beautiful 
girl, but I think you are a liar. I think that  

947
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,680
everything you've said to me has been lies. 
I don't think you've ever told me the truth.'

948
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:06,400
The blonde girl's face slowly became 
red. She looked straight at me.

949
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:11,440
'Mr Samuel,' she said, 'I'm paying 
you a lot of money to work for me.  

950
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,960
I asked you to find my sister. I 
didn't ask you to call me a liar.'

951
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,200
'Well, Miss Garfield, I think 
I have found Elaine Garfield.  

952
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,800
Would you like me to tell you where she is?'

953
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,320
'Yes,' the blonde girl said, 'where is Elaine?'

954
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:30,000
'She's here in this cafe,' I said. 
'Elaine Garfield is sitting next to me.  

955
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,240
You are Elaine Garfield. 
Helen Garfield doesn't exist.  

956
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:39,440
You pretended to be Helen Garfield, but 
there really never was any such person.

957
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:46,000
'The police in New York say that Helen Garfield 
doesn't exist,' I went on. 'Helen Garfield and  

958
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,520
Elaine Garfield are the same person. You are 
Elaine Garfield and you pretended to be Helen.'

959
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,760
The blonde girl stood up angrily.

960
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,400
'How much money do you want, Mr Samuel? You 
are no longer working for me,' she shouted.

961
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,840
'Sit down,' I said quietly.

962
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,920
The blonde girl did not sit down, 
so I pulled her down beside me.

963
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,600
'Now listen, Miss Garfield,' I 
said firmly. 'You are going to  

964
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,720
tell me all about yourself 
and why you came to see me.  

965
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:18,320
I want to know all about Benny Creep and Las 
Cabanas. I want to know why you disappeared.'

966
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,320
'I won't tell you anything,' she said.

967
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:25,200
'Oh, yes, you will tell me everything,' I 
replied, 'you'll tell me everything or else  

968
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:30,160
I'll take you straight to the police. You see, 
the police are looking for me at this moment.

969
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:34,320
'The police think that I may have killed 
Benny Greep,' I continued. 'The police  

970
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:38,160
know that I had a fight at Las Cabanas 
last night. A red haired man and his  

971
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:43,280
tall friend are also chasing me. They are the 
two men who started the fight at Las Cabanas.  

972
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:47,520
They will try to kill me if I don't tell them 
where you are. So you see, Miss Garfield,  

973
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,360
I think you had better tell me everything. 
I'm the only person who can help you.'

974
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:57,280
The blonde girl sat in silence for 
a minute. Then she began to cry.

975
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:13,840
'All right,' she said, 'I'll tell you 
everything. I am Elaine Garfield.'

976
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,480
CHAPTER NINETEEN

977
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,560
Everything Is Explained

978
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,200
I looked at the blonde girl.

979
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:28,880
'So you agree that you're really Elaine 
Garfield and not Helen,' I said quietly.  

980
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,120
'Now tell me about Benny Greep.'

981
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,280
The girl took a deep breath.

982
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,760
'Suzy Graham and I used to go out dancing 
together a lot,' said Elaine. 'We often  

983
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:45,120
went to Las Cabanas. One night when we were 
there, I met a wonderful man called Benny.  

984
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,200
Benny was the drummer in the 
band. I liked him very much and  

985
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:53,840
went to the nightclub very often, to 
see Benny. We became very good friends.'

986
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,280
The girl stopped again and 
took out her handkerchief.

987
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,000
'Go on,' I said quietly.

988
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,560
'I used to go to Las Cabanas to 
see Benny nearly every night,  

989
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,960
but it was difficult for us to talk 
to each other,' the girl continued.

990
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,800
'Why was it difficult for you and 
Benny to talk to each other?' I asked.

991
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,160
'Because Benny was the drummer 
in the band, of course,'

992
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:19,920
Elaine Garfield replied. 'We couldn't 
talk to each other very much,  

993
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,160
because he was playing with 
the band most of the evening.'

994
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,000
'I understand,' I said and 
ordered two more coffees.

995
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,960
'So I spent a lot of time in Las 
Cabanas, watching Benny play the drums,'  

996
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:35,040
the girl said. 'And I also watched everything 
else which happened in the nightclub.'

997
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,040
'What did you see?' I asked.

998
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,720
'I didn't notice anything unusual at first,' 
the girl replied. 'But, after a few nights,  

999
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:46,240
I noticed that the same people always 
came to the club, at the same time.'

1000
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,320
'Which people?' I asked.

1001
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,640
'There was a red-haired man,  

1002
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,520
a tall man who never took off his hat, and 
one or two others,' said Elaine Garfield.

1003
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,040
'Yes,' I said, 'I think I have met two of them.  

1004
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,840
They were the men who hit me on 
the head in the Manson Building.'

1005
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:08,080
'Anyway,' the girl continued, 'one night, I asked 
Benny why these men came to the club every night.  

1006
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:13,360
Benny told me not to ask questions. So I watched 
the men more carefully afterwards and noticed  

1007
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,400
that they always arrived with bags. But when 
the men left, they weren't carrying bags.'

1008
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,560
'What did you do then?' I asked.

1009
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:25,440
'I asked Benny about the men again,' she 
said. 'Benny said that there were a lot  

1010
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,520
of strange things happening at Las Cabanas, 
and that it was dangerous to ask questions.'

1011
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,840
The waiter brought the coffees and 
Elaine waited until he had gone.

1012
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,600
'One night,' she continued, 'one of the 
men was sitting at the table next to me.  

1013
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,960
He was talking to some other men and 
he opened the bag that he was carrying.  

1014
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:49,680
I was sitting quite close and I could see into the 
bag. The bag was full of diamonds and jewellery.'

1015
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,200
'Really?' I said and drank my coffee.

1016
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,360
'I told Benny about the bag of jewellery,  

1017
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:00,080
later on in the evening,' continued Elaine. 
'Benny was very excited at the news.

1018
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:05,120
He told me that he had known for a long 
time that criminals used Las Cabanas.  

1019
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,000
They used the club as a place 
to buy and sell stolen things.  

1020
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,720
Benny and I talked all evening about the bag 
of jewellery. Benny said that the jewellery  

1021
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:17,360
was stolen. The men who were selling it were 
criminals and they had stolen the jewellery.

1022
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:22,480
'Well,' Elaine continued, 'Benny 
wanted to steal one of the bags.  

1023
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,800
He said that the jewellery was stolen, so it 
didn't matter if we stole it from the criminals.  

1024
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:31,440
I agreed to help him. We hoped to sell the 
bag and to use the money to go away together.'

1025
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,760
'I see,' I said, 'and did you help 
Benny to steal the bag of jewellery?'

1026
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:42,240
'Yes, we waited for nearly a week,' Elaine 
replied. 'Then, last Sunday, I had a chance  

1027
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:47,280
to steal the bag. It was at the end of the 
evening, and nearly everyone had left the club.  

1028
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:51,440
I had found out where they hid the bag and 
I was able to take it and give it to Benny.  

1029
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Benny had big bags in which he carried 
his drums. It was easy for him to hide  

1030
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,280
the bag of jewellery in the drum 
bag. We left the club together,  

1031
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:04,320
with the bag of jewellery. We decided to hide the 
jewellery in my apartment and then sell it later.

1032
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:10,000
'The next day was Monday,' Elaine continued, 
'and I went to work. In the afternoon,  

1033
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,240
I had a telephone call from Benny. Benny 
said that the red-haired man knew that the  

1034
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:20,160
bag of jewellery had been stolen. He was very 
angry. Benny told me to stop work and go home.  

1035
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:25,040
He told me to stay at home, to make sure that no 
one came to take the jewels. Benny was going to  

1036
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:29,280
continue working at Las Cabanas. Then no one 
would think that he had stolen the jewels.'

1037
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,680
'And did you stay at home?' I asked.

1038
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:37,440
'Yes, I stayed at home for three days,' Elaine 
replied. 'But I was afraid that the red-haired  

1039
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,520
man would find out where I was living. Then 
he would come to get the bag of jewellery.'

1040
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,760
'So what did you do?' I asked.

1041
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,800
'That was easy,' she said, with a smile.  

1042
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,600
'I moved into a hotel in the centre 
of the town and then came to see you.'

1043
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,040
'But why did you come to see me?' I asked.

1044
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:59,360
'To make sure that I was safe,' said 
Elaine. 'I pretended to be my sister  

1045
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:04,640
and said that I had disappeared. I asked you 
to find me. Then I knew that I was safe.'

1046
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,200
'Why?' I asked.

1047
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:10,880
'Because you were looking for me,' 
Elaine continued. 'If the men from  

1048
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,720
Las Cabanas found me or took me away, 
you would find out and chase them.'

1049
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,560
'Thank you very much for thinking 
that I am such a good detective,'  

1050
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,000
I said. 'But why didn't you tell me the truth?'

1051
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:35,840
'That's easy,' said Elaine. 'I didn't 
want to tell you about the jewels.'
 
 

1052
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,480
CHAPTER TWENTY

1053
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,800
I'm Sorry, Mr Samuel

1054
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,280
'Go on with your story,' I said.

1055
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:51,920
'The evening I came to see you at your office,' 
said Elaine, 'I telephoned Benny at Las Cabanas.  

1056
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,680
I told Benny what I had done. Benny 
told me that the red-haired man knew  

1057
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,720
that we had stolen the jewellery. 
Benny told me that there would be  

1058
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:02,000
no trouble if I brought the jewels 
back to Las Cabanas the next night.'

1059
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,400
'You were stupid to trust 
the red-haired man,' I said.

1060
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:11,920
'I know,' the girl said. 'I was afraid. So I 
asked you to meet me at Las Cabanas at midnight'

1061
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:18,320
'So you didn't know that Benny was dead 
until I told you at Las Cabanas,' I said.

1062
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:23,360
'No,' Elaine said. 'That is why I 
ran away before midnight. I decided  

1063
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,000
not to give them the jewellery, 
because they had killed Benny.'

1064
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,800
'You've still got the jewels, then?' I 
asked, in surprise. 'Where are they?'

1065
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:35,680
'Here,' Elaine said, and pointed 
to a small bag under the table.

1066
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:41,520
I reached under the table, picked up the hag 
and opened it. The bag was full of diamonds  

1067
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:46,320
and jewellery. Just then I heard a voice 
and, at the same time, Elaine screamed.

1068
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,040
'Give it to me!' said the voice.

1069
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:55,680
I looked up quickly and saw Jo standing beside 
me. His tall friend was right behind him.

1070
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:58,560
'Give me the bag!' said Jo, once again.

1071
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,760
'How did you know I was here?' I asked.

1072
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:08,160
'You parked your car right outside,' said 
Jo, with a laugh. 'Now, give me the bag.'

1073
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:15,280
I passed him the bag. As I gave him the bag, I 
jumped to my feet and hit Jo hard in the face.  

1074
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,440
He tripped and fell heavily onto the 
floor. I moved towards the tall man,  

1075
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:24,320
who was still standing a few feet away. I was 
about to run at him, but then I stopped. The  

1076
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,640
tall man had taken a gun from his pocket 
and the gun was pointing straight at me.

1077
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:33,120
'Right,' said the tall man. 'Don't 
move or else I'll shoot you.'

1078
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:37,920
Jo got up from the floor. He still 
had the bag of jewellery in his hand.  

1079
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,520
Together, Jo and his friend with 
the gun walked towards the door.  

1080
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,200
They walked backwards, to make sure that 
Elaine and I did not try to get the bag back.

1081
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,480
As the two men reached the 
door, I started to laugh.

1082
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:52,000
'What are you laughing at?' 
shouted the man with the gun.

1083
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,080
'Look behind you,' I said.

1084
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:01,120
Both men turned around and looked. In the 
doorway of the cafe stood Sergeant Murphy,  

1085
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:06,720
with two other policemen. Sergeant Murphy jumped 
on the tall man with the gun and Jo ran back into  

1086
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,920
the cafe. I stepped forward to stop Jo and 
he ran straight into me. We both fell on the  

1087
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:17,200
floor and the two policemen ran up. One of the 
policemen held Jo. The other policeman held me.

1088
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,080
'They are the criminals,' I shouted, 
pointing at Jo and his friend, 'not me.'

1089
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,000
'You are all coming down to the police station,'  

1090
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,960
Sergeant Murphy said and looked over to 
Elaine Garfield. 'You must come, too.'

1091
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:37,040
It took a long time to tell Sergeant 
Murphy the whole story. In the end,  

1092
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:42,240
he believed what Elaine and I told him. The 
sergeant warned me not to tell him lies again,  

1093
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:48,160
and agreed to let me go free. Elaine told 
Sergeant Murphy all she knew about Las Cabanas.  

1094
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:52,320
The sergeant was very pleased to catch 
Jo and his friend with the jewels.  

1095
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:56,800
Sergeant Murphy agreed to let Elaine go 
free, because she helped catch the criminals.

1096
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,360
As we were leaving the police station,  

1097
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:03,280
I asked Sergeant Murphy how he had 
found us in the "Seventh Man" cafe.

1098
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:09,280
'It was very lucky, really,' said the 
sergeant. 'We went to your office to see you,  

1099
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:14,560
but you weren't there. As we were leaving, we 
saw the red-haired man and his friend entering.  

1100
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,920
We waited and when they left, 
we followed them to the cafe.'

1101
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:24,160
'Thank you very much, Sergeant,' said 
Elaine. 'And thank you very much, Mr Samuel.'

1102
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:28,800
'That's all right,' I said, 'you 
are paying me fifty dollars a day.'

1103
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:32,720
'I'm sorry, Mr Samuel,' Elaine said,  

1104
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:38,800
'I'm afraid I can't pay you. Now that I've given 
the jewels to the police, I don't have any money.'

1105
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:47,840
I smiled and got into the old grey Chrysler and 
drove back to the office. I didn't say goodbye.  

1106
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:54,960
When I got back to the office, I sat down in my 
chair. It's not much fun being a private eye.  

1107
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:15,840
You get hit on the head, nearly killed, and chased 
by the police. And you don't always get paid.
 
 
 
 

1108
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:23,326
- THE END -
