1
00:00:01,489 --> 00:00:08,069
Pauline Attenborough was seventy-two years
old, but she looked much younger.

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,169
When a soft light shone on her, she could
look as young as thirty.

3
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:18,990
She had a lovely figure and face, and her
nose was a very good shape.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,550
Only her big grey eyes made her look older.

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,000
Pauline had left her husband, Ronald, many
years ago.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,720
Pauline and Ronald had had two sons, Henry
and Robert.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,070
Henry, the older son, had died when Robert
was only ten.

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,500
Now Robert was thirty-two.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,600
He lived with his mother and worked as a lawyer
in London.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,890
Robert Attenborough did not earn very much
money, but this was not a problem.

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,190
His mother was a rich woman.

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,130
Pauline's niece, Ciss, also lived in the house.

13
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,710
Her father, Ronald Attenborough's brother,
had died five years ago.

14
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,750
Ciss had no money or home of her own.

15
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,909
She needed a place to live.

16
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,229
So she depended on her Aunt Pauline.

17
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:17,869
Ciss was a big young woman, with dark hair
and eyes.

18
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,350
She was very shy.

19
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,270
She was in love with her cousin, Robert, but
she had never told him this.

20
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,900
Robert was also very shy.

21
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,640
He had no confidence in himself.

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,350
Pauline, Robert and Ciss lived together quietly,
in a lovely house about twenty-five miles

23
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,319
from London.

24
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,420
The house was surrounded by pleasant gardens.

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,200
It was the perfect house and the perfect life
for Pauline.

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,189
Every day, Robert went to work in London.

27
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:57,039
Then when he came home, the three of them
- Pauline, Robert and Ciss - ate dinner together.

28
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,490
During dinner, there were always candles on
the table.

29
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,380
Pauline liked candles because the soft candlelight
made her look young and beautiful.

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:14,840
The soft light shone on the skin of her bare
arms and the soft material of her dress.

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,560
Pauline shone with happiness.

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,360
She looked like a beautiful woman of only
thirty-two or thirty-three.

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,420
After dinner, they had coffee in the warm
drawing room.

34
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,780
The room was full of lovely furniture.

35
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:36,860
For many years, Pauline had collected furniture
and beautiful, unusual pictures from many

36
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,090
different countries.

37
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,750
She had sold these things to museums for a
lot of money.

38
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,260
This had made her a rich woman.

39
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,680
Pauline, Robert and Ciss chatted together
pleasantly.

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,050
Their conversation was always simple and bright.

41
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,950
Then at half-past eight, Ciss carried the
tray of coffee things out of the room.

42
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,710
Robert always stayed and continued chatting
to his mother.

43
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,550
He always listened to everything that she
said.

44
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,680
At the side of the house, there was a large
courtyard.

45
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,070
Ciss had a flat just across the courtyard,
above the old coach house and stables.

46
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:22,650
Several years ago, a carriage and horses had
been kept in these buildings.

47
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,010
Now Robert kept his car in the coach-house.

48
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,700
Ciss did not always go to her flat after dinner.

49
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,860
In summer, she sometimes sat outside in the
large garden.

50
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,260
She listened to Pauline's laughter coming
from the drawing room.

51
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,660
In winter, Ciss put on a thick coat and walked
through the garden and down to the little

52
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,360
bridge over the stream.

53
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,820
She liked to hear the water running under
the bridge.

54
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,590
She would look back at the lighted windows
of the drawing room, where Pauline and Robert

55
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,940
were so happy together.

56
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,540
Ciss loved Robert.

57
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,960
'I believe that Pauline wants Robert to marry
me when she dies,' she thought.

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,480
'But Robert is very shy.

59
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,140
Perhaps his mother won't die for many years.

60
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,820
By that time, it will be too late.

61
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,900
Robert will be just an empty man who never
enjoyed his life.'

62
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,169
Sometimes Ciss stayed in the dark garden until
about ten o'clock, when she saw the light

63
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,389
go on in Pauline's bedroom.

64
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,749
Robert usually stayed in the drawing room
for another hour, then he would go to bed

65
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:37,749
too.

66
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:42,530
Ciss, standing in the garden, wanted to go
to him.

67
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,060
She wanted to say, 'Oh, Robert!

68
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,620
This is all wrong!'

69
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,849
But she could not do this because Aunt Pauline
would hear.

70
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:56,280
So she went to her own rooms.

71
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,300
In the mornings, Robert went to London at
about nine o'clock.

72
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,279
Pauline rested in bed.

73
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,300
She came downstairs at lunchtime.

74
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,490
Sometimes she did not leave her bedroom until
teatime.

75
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,950
But she always looked fresh and young.

76
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,289
Pauline always had a rest in the afternoons.

77
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:20,990
When the sun shone, she liked to lie outside
and bathe in the warm sun.

78
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:27,069
Behind the stables, there was a second, smaller
courtyard, which was surrounded by trees.

79
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:34,529
The sun shone right down into this little
courtyard, so it was a perfect place for sunbathing.

80
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:41,180
Here, Ciss put a chair for Pauline to lie
on, a large umbrella and blankets.

81
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,949
If the sun became too hot, Pauline could lie
in the shade of the umbrella.

82
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:52,430
One afternoon, Ciss decided to sunbathe too.

83
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:58,160
She found a ladder and climbed up onto the
flat roof of the stables.

84
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,960
Then she lay down on a blanket in one corner
of the roof.

85
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,740
The sun shone brightly here and it was very
hot.

86
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,699
Ciss was above Aunt Pauline, who lay in the
little courtyard below.

87
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,199
But Pauline did not know that Ciss was on
the roof above her.

88
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,360
It was lovely, lying in the warm sun and air.

89
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,309
The warmth of the sun on her legs and arms
made Ciss feel comfortable and relaxed.

90
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:32,979
Suddenly she heard a voice speaking softly
and her heart jumped with fear and shock.

91
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:36,860
'No, Henry dear!' said the voice.

92
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,330
'It was not my fault that you died instead
of marrying Claudia.'

93
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,210
The voice did not sound human.

94
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,699
Where was it coming from?

95
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,449
There must be someone on the roof!

96
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:54,039
Ciss lifted her head and looked around.

97
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,199
But there was nobody on the roof with her.

98
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,949
Suddenly she heard the soft voice again.

99
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,210
'No, darling!

100
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:06,190
I said that you would be tired of her in six
months!

101
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,430
I warned you, and it was true.

102
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,270
I couldn't do anything more.

103
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,909
And you died without ever knowing me again.'

104
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:18,610
The voice was silent.

105
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,410
Ciss lay on her blanket.

106
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,729
It was a beautiful summer afternoon.

107
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:26,960
Did the voice belong to a ghost?

108
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,150
Ciss hated the idea of ghosts, spirits and
magic.

109
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,539
Then she heard a deep sigh and the strange
voice spoke again.

110
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:43,419
'Ah, well, a heart must feel pain!

111
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,030
But it wasn't my fault, dear.

112
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:53,830
It is better for a heart to feel pain, rather
than break from sorrow.

113
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,870
And Robert could marry poor, boring Ciss tomorrow,
if he wanted to.

114
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,100
But he doesn't care about her.'

115
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,639
Ciss sat up quickly.

116
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,659
She was very surprised.

117
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:08,840
It was Aunt Pauline talking!

118
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,460
It must be Aunt Pauline!

119
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,810
Where was she?

120
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,909
And how was Ciss hearing her strange whispers?

121
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:20,210
Aunt Pauline must be lying right below her.

122
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,879
And she must be using a trick to make her
voice sound strange.

123
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,469
Aunt Pauline was trying to frighten her!

124
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:32,370
Ciss was still afraid, but she was now thinking
more clearly.

125
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,459
Ciss lay down again.

126
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:39,560
She knew the story of Henry, Robert's older
brother.

127
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,210
Henry had been in love with Claudia, a beautiful
young actress.

128
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:48,840
But his mother had been against Claudia and
had laughed at Henry.

129
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,759
Henry had become ill with a brain disease
and died at the age of twenty two.

130
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:59,829
'I think that I should get up now,' the voice
was saying.

131
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:02,509
'I've had enough sun.

132
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:08,459
A woman might live forever if she has enough
sun, love and good food.

133
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:14,220
I truly believe a good life will make me live
forever.'

134
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,990
'That is certainly Aunt Pauline's voice,'
Ciss said to herself.

135
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,959
'How horrible!

136
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,550
I'm hearing Aunt Pauline's thoughts.'

137
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,589
Ciss turned and looked down in front of her.

138
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:31,639
She was staring at a hole in the corner of
the roof.

139
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:38,889
The lead gutter, the pipe for taking away
the rainwater, went down into this hole.

140
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:42,990
The water then came out of the rain pipe,
near the ground.

141
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,930
Suddenly a sigh and a whisper came out of
the hole.

142
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,399
'Ah well, Pauline!

143
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,600
Get up.

144
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,209
You've had enough sun today.'

145
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:58,550
Now Ciss understood.

146
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:05,319
Aunt Pauline was lying below her and the rain
pipe was carrying her voice up to the roof!

147
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:08,240
Aunt Pauline was speaking her thoughts aloud.

148
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,190
She did not know that the sound of her voice
was going up to the roof.

149
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:17,829
So Aunt Pauline was feeling guilty about Henry's
death.

150
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:21,560
He had died and she thought that it was her
fault.

151
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:29,370
Ciss believed that Pauline had loved her big,
handsome son Henry, more than she loved Robert.

152
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,920
Henry's death had been a terrible shock for
Pauline.

153
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,320
She only loved Robert because Henry was dead.

154
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,290
Ciss put on her clothes, picked up her blanket,
and carefully climbed down the ladder.

155
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,470
As she went down, she heard her aunt calling,
'All right, Ciss!'

156
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,360
The lovely lady had finished sunbathing.

157
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,670
She was returning to the house.

158
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,210
Ciss went into the small courtyard.

159
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:03,350
She picked up Pauline's blankets and the chair
and put them in the house.

160
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,600
Then she looked for the opening of the rain
pipe.

161
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,060
She found it in the corner of two walls of
the stable building.

162
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,740
The mouth of the rain pipe was almost hidden
by the leaves of a plant on the wall.

163
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:21,350
When Pauline sat in her chair and turned her
face to the wall, her mouth would be near

164
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,709
to the rain pipe.

165
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:25,990
Ciss had heard her aunt's voice.

166
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,240
No ghosts, spirits, or magic had made the
voice.

167
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,449
That evening, after they had drunk their coffee,
Pauline stood up.

168
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:40,800
'The sun has made me so sleepy today,' she
said.

169
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,810
'I shall go to bed now.

170
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,440
You two sit and chat.'

171
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,810
When Pauline had gone to bed, Ciss turned
towards Robert.

172
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,389
'Do you remember your brother, Henry?'

173
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:57,680
she asked him.

174
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,270
Robert looked at her in surprise.

175
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,220
'Yes, very well,' he said.

176
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,670
'What was he like?' asked Ciss.

177
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:13,520
'Tall and handsome, with soft brown hair like
mother,' Robert said.

178
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,840
'Women liked him.

179
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,880
Henry was very happy and clever.'

180
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,660
'Did he love your mother?'

181
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,480
'Very much,' Robert said.

182
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,870
'She loved him too - more than she loves me.'

183
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,550
'Robert,' Ciss said.

184
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,660
'Do you like me?'

185
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,360
Ciss saw Robert's face become pale.

186
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,270
'Yes,' Robert said.

187
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,810
'I like you very much.'

188
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,040
'Will you kiss me?

189
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,339
Nobody ever kisses me,' Ciss said.

190
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:52,980
Robert looked at his cousin with fear in his
eyes.

191
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,529
Then he stood up and kissed her gently on
the cheek.

192
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:01,350
Ciss held Robert's hand and pressed it against
her breast.

193
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,010
'Come and sit with me in the garden,' she
said.

194
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,029
'But what about mother?' he said.

195
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,120
He was nervous and shy.

196
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,139
Ciss smiled a little and looked into his eyes.

197
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,029
Suddenly Robert's face became red.

198
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:25,260
A few minutes later, she left him and went
to her flat.

199
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,120
The sunny weather continued.

200
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,250
It was now July.

201
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,220
Every afternoon, Pauline sunbathed in the
small courtyard.

202
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,240
And Ciss lay on the roof above the stables,
listening.

203
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,660
But the sound of Pauline's voice did not come
up the pipe again.

204
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,690
After dinner in the evenings, Ciss waited
in the garden.

205
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,069
She saw the light go on in her aunt's bedroom.

206
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:53,579
She saw the lights go out in the drawing room.

207
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:58,560
She waited, but Robert did not come into the
garden.

208
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,310
Then one night, he came out and walked towards
her.

209
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,029
Ciss stood up and walked softly over the grass
to him.

210
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,410
'Don't speak,' Robert whispered.

211
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,700
They stood together, looking up at the stars
in the dark sky.

212
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,699
'How can I ask you to love me?' he said.

213
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:22,779
'And how can I marry?

214
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,089
I haven't made much money.

215
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:27,230
And I can't ask my mother for money.'

216
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,090
'Then don't worry about marrying yet,' Ciss
said.

217
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,540
'But do love me a little.'

218
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,910
Robert gave a short laugh.

219
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,379
'It's hard to begin,' he said.

220
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:45,150
They sat down and he held her hand.

221
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,990
At last, she said goodnight, stood up, and
went indoors.

222
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:54,100
The next day, Ciss lay on the roof, sunbathing.

223
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,430
Suddenly she heard her aunt's voice from the
hole in the lead gutter.

224
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:04,290
First Pauline spoke in Italian, then she spoke
in English.

225
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,740
'No, Robert dear,' said Pauline's voice.

226
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,990
'You will never be the same kind of man as
your father.

227
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,879
But you look like him.

228
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,630
Mauro was a wonderful lover.

229
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,630
Mauro!

230
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,630
Mauro!

231
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,930
How you loved me!'

232
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,089
The voice stopped speaking.

233
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:32,249
Ciss realized that her aunt had a secret.

234
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:37,200
Pauline's husband, Ronald, had not been Robert's
father!

235
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,889
Robert's father had been an Italian man called
Mauro.

236
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:47,779
'I'm disappointed with you, Robert,' continued
Pauline's voice.

237
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:53,100
'Your father was a priest, but he was the
best lover in the world.

238
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,970
You are like a cold fish.

239
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,940
And Ciss is like a cat who is trying to catch
you.'

240
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:07,680
Ciss suddenly put her mouth near the hole
in the rain pipe and spoke.

241
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,910
'Leave Robert alone!'

242
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,290
she said in a deep voice.

243
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,300
'Don't kill him too.'

244
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,320
There was a silence.

245
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,649
The hot afternoon sun shone on the flat roof
of the stables.

246
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,529
Ciss listened, with her heart beating quickly.

247
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:35,120
At last, she heard her aunt Pauline whisper
the words, 'Did someone speak?'

248
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,800
Ciss spoke again into the hole of the lead
gutter.

249
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,790
'You killed me,' she said in a deep, terrible
voice.

250
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,630
'Don't kill Robert too!'

251
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,240
'Ah!' said Pauline, giving a little cry.

252
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,259
'Who's speaking?'

253
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:00,379
'Henry!' said Ciss in the same, deep voice.

254
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:02,920
There was silence again.

255
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,089
'I didn't kill you, Henry,' said Pauline.

256
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,089
'No!

257
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,089
No!

258
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,120
Henry, it wasn't my fault.

259
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,809
I loved you, my dearest boy.

260
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:18,850
I only wanted to help you.'

261
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,360
'You killed me!'

262
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,640
Ciss said in the deep voice.

263
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,470
Now, let Robert live.

264
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,780
Let him go!

265
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,090
Let him marry!'

266
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,400
'Henry!' said Pauline.

267
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,860
Are you a ghost?

268
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,260
Have you come to punish me for your death?'

269
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,720
'YES!

270
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:52,670
I HAVE COME TO PUNISH YOU!' said Ciss in a
terrible, frightening voice.

271
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,410
She was very angry with Pauline.

272
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,299
She felt that her anger was going down the
rain pipe to her aunt.

273
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,430
At the same time, she almost laughed.

274
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,470
This was a very funny conversation!

275
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,929
Ciss lay and listened.

276
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:13,990
No sound came from the rain pipe.

277
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,320
The afternoon had become cooler.

278
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,720
Yellow and grey clouds had covered the sun.

279
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,880
There was a roar of thunder.

280
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,279
A storm was coming.

281
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:29,850
Ciss dressed quickly, went down the ladder,
and ran to the corner of the stables.

282
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,700
'Aunt Pauline!'

283
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,700
she called.

284
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,289
'Did you hear thunder?'

285
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:36,289
'Y-yes!

286
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:42,220
I am going indoors,' her aunt replied in a
weak voice.

287
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,679
'Don't wait for me.'

288
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:48,660
Ciss watched her aunt go inside the house.

289
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,809
The sky was growing darker.

290
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:55,730
Ciss took the blankets and the chair and hurried
inside.

291
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,159
Then the storm began.

292
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:03,240
Pauline did not come downstairs to tea because
she did not like thunder.

293
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,710
Robert did not arrive home until after tea.

294
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,620
By this time, the rain was pouring down.

295
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,740
Ciss went to her flat and got ready for dinner.

296
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,720
She put on a pretty white dress and fastened
some white flowers at her breast.

297
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,910
When she went into the drawing room, Robert
was waiting.

298
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:28,840
He was standing by the drawing-room window
and listening to the rain falling.

299
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,360
He now had a different look on his face as
he watched her.

300
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,110
The drawing room was lit by the soft light
of a table lamp.

301
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,350
Ciss walked towards the bookshelves near the
door.

302
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:47,270
When she heard the door opening softly, Ciss
suddenly turned on the switch of the ceiling

303
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,320
light.

304
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,029
Her aunt, wearing a black dress, stood in
the doorway.

305
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:57,510
The strong, hard light showed her face clearly.

306
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:04,270
Pauline was wearing make-up, but her face
looked old and full of hate.

307
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,010
'Oh, aunt!' cried Ciss.

308
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:16,300
'Mother, you look like a little old lady!'
said Robert in a shocked voice.

309
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:22,600
'Aren't we going to eat dinner?' asked Pauline
angrily.

310
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,909
Pauline sat at the table, getting angrier
and angrier.

311
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:30,650
She looked very, very old and very ugly.

312
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,510
Ciss and Robert watched each other.

313
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,350
He was very shocked by his mother's face.

314
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,970
Pauline ate her dinner quickly, like a hungry
dog.

315
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,770
As soon as they had finished eating, she ran
towards the stairs.

316
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,779
Robert and Ciss followed her from the room.

317
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,110
'You pour the coffee.

318
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,200
I hate it,' said the old woman quickly.

319
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,270
'I'm going to bed!

320
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,340
Goodnight!'

321
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,549
There was silence.

322
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:04,960
At last, Robert said, 'I'm afraid that mother
isn't well.

323
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,210
She must see a doctor.'

324
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,770
'Yes,' said Ciss.

325
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,990
The rest of the evening passed in silence.

326
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,880
Robert and Ciss stayed in the drawing room.

327
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,960
A fire was lit.

328
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,179
Outside, cold rain was falling.

329
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:27,880
At about ten o'clock, the door opened and
Pauline came into the room.

330
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,120
She shut the door and came to the fire.

331
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,150
Then she looked at Robert and Ciss with hate
in her eyes.

332
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,900
'You two should get married quickly,' she
said in an ugly voice.

333
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,770
'You are so much in love.'

334
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,580
Robert looked up at his mother.

335
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,520
'You believed that cousins should not marry,
Mother,' he said quietly.

336
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,710
'You told me that often.'

337
00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:00,510
'I do believe that cousins shouldn't marry,'
replied Pauline.

338
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,580
'But you're not cousins.

339
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,820
Your father was an Italian priest, Robert.

340
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,800
He was a great man.

341
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,320
And he was too great to have a weak son like
you.'

342
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,090
With a terrible look on her face, Pauline
left the room.

343
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,809
Pauline had gone mad.

344
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:24,260
Her madness continued for a week.

345
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,399
The doctor came and told her that she must
sleep.

346
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:29,340
He gave her drugs to help her.

347
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,909
But she did not take the medicine.

348
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:37,580
She walked about her room, looking ugly and
full of hate.

349
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,539
She would not look at either Robert or Ciss.

350
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:45,790
At first, Ciss was frightened by what she
had done.

351
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,600
She realized that her trick had made her aunt
mad.

352
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,350
Ciss almost felt sorry for the terrible thing
that she had done.

353
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,059
Then she thought, 'This woman is the real
Pauline.

354
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,039
We never saw her true character before.'

355
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,740
But Pauline was not going to live long.

356
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,110
She stayed in her room, and did not see anyone.

357
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,590
She had her mirrors taken away.

358
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,200
She did not want to look at herself.

359
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,600
Robert and Ciss spent a lot of time together.

360
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,909
But Ciss could not tell Robert what she had
done.

361
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:23,500
She was afraid.

362
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,680
'Do you think that your mother ever loved
anybody?'

363
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,480
Ciss asked him one evening.

364
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,710
'Mother only loved herself!'

365
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,830
Robert said.

366
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,460
'And she loved power.

367
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,680
She got her power by controlling other people's
lives.

368
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,580
She was beautiful, and she grew strong by
controlling everyone and everything.

369
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,820
She destroyed Henry and she was destroying
me.'

370
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:55,480
'And don't you forgive her?' asked Ciss.

371
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,909
'No, I don't.

372
00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:02,419
She took other people's hopes and happiness
and destroyed them.'

373
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:06,360
Two days later, Pauline died.

374
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,169
Ciss found her dead, in her bed.

375
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:16,049
Pauline's heart had become weak, and the drugs
that she took were too strong for her.

376
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:23,659
But after her death, Pauline got her revenge
on her son and her niece.

377
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:30,970
Pauline Attenborough was a very rich woman,
but she left Robert only one thousand pounds.

378
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,640
And she left Ciss only one hundred pounds.

379
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,940
The rest of her money went to a museum.

380
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:45,360
She had built a museum and given it her own
name - the Pauline Attenborough Museum.

381
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,150
- THE END -
