1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:13,940
At this time of year, and this time of day,
there were very few people in the park.

2
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,100
It was probable that the young lady, who was
sitting on one of the benches, had just wanted

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,100
to rest for a while and think about the coming
spring.

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,870
She sat there, thoughtful and still.

5
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:35,210
The sadness in her eyes seemed to be something
new, because it had not yet changed her bright

6
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:41,640
young face, nor turned her soft lips into
a thin hard line.

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,130
A tall young man came walking through the
park along the path near the bench where she

8
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,550
was sitting.

9
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:55,640
Behind him came a boy carrying a suitcase.

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:04,489
When the man saw the young lady, his face
changed to red and back to pale again.

11
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:11,140
He watched her face as he came closer, and
his own face showed both hope and worry at

12
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,570
the same time.

13
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:19,460
He passed her only a few meters away, but
she gave no sign that she had seen him, or

14
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,760
even knew he was there.

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:31,200
Fifty meters further on the young man suddenly
stopped and sat down on a bench by the path.

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,290
The boy dropped the suitcase and stared at
him with wondering eyes.

17
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,509
The young man took out his handkerchief and
wiped his face.

18
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:47,580
It was a good handkerchief, a good face, and
the young man was good to look at.

19
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,970
He said to the boy:

20
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,720
'I want you to take a message to that young
lady on that bench.

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,760
Tell her I am on my way to the station, to
leave for San Francisco.

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,720
From there I shall travel north to the wild
places of Alaska.

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,789
Tell her that, as she has ordered me neither
to speak nor to write to her, I am taking

24
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,830
this chance to appeal to her one last time.

25
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,469
Tell her that she has been unkind and unjust
to someone who has done no wrong; and she

26
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:25,340
has given him no reasons and no explanations.

27
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,310
Tell her that I do not believe her to be an
unjust person.

28
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,950
Tell her that I have disobeyed her orders,
in the hope that she will return to the paths

29
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,719
of justice and reason.

30
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,409
Go, and tell her that.'

31
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:47,540
The young man dropped a half-dollar into the
boy's hand.

32
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,990
The boy looked at him for a moment with bright,
intelligent eyes out of a dirty face, then

33
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,239
turned and ran down the path.

34
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,819
As he came closer to the lady on the bench,
he studied her carefully.

35
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,269
The lady looked back at him coolly.

36
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:16,189
'Lady,' the boy said, 'that guy on the other
bench sent yer a song and dance by me.

37
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:22,469
If yer don't know the guy, and he's tryin'
to do some funny business, say the word, and

38
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,029
I'll call a cop in three minutes.

39
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:29,629
If yer does know him, and he's all right,
then I'll give yer the song and dance that

40
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,459
he gave me.'

41
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,129
The young lady showed a little, just a little
interest.

42
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,879
'A song and dance!'

43
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:45,540
she said, in a very sweet voice that seemed
to suggest something not at all sweet.

44
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:52,809
'A new idea - a kind of traveling singer,
I suppose.

45
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:59,919
I used to know the gentleman who sent you,
so it will not be necessary to call the police.

46
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,709
Please begin your song and dance, but do not
sing too loudly.

47
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,379
It is not really the time or the place for
that kind of thing.'

48
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:13,419
'Aw, come on, lady,' said the boy, 'yer know
what I mean.

49
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:18,769
It ain't a song and dance really, it's a lot
of hot air.

50
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:25,840
He told me to tell you he's got his shirts
in that case and he's movin' on to 'Frisco.

51
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,830
Then he's goin' on up to Alaska.

52
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,039
He says yer told him not to send round no
more love notes, nor stand around lookin'

53
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,050
over the garden gate.

54
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,470
He says yer threw him out like last year's
hat, and never gave him no chance to argue.

55
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,520
He says yer told him to go, and never said
why.'

56
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,580
The interest in the young lady's eyes did
not go away.

57
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,150
Perhaps her interest was in the cleverness
of the future Alaskan traveler, who had found

58
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,870
a way to get round her orders.

59
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,730
She fixed her eyes on an untidy-looking tree
in the park, and spoke to the messenger:

60
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,150
'Tell the gentleman that he knows very well
what my ideals are.

61
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,750
He knows what they have been, and he knows
what they still are.

62
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:23,910
In this matter, the two most important ideals
are that a person should be true, and loyal.

63
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:30,960
Tell him that I have studied my own heart,
and I know that it can be weak, as well as

64
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
strong.

65
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,310
That is why I do not wish to listen to his
arguments or to hear any words from him at

66
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,520
all.

67
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,090
I am not unjust, and have never been unjust.

68
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:50,229
But if he really wants to hear what he already
knows, you may tell him this...

69
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:56,569
'Tell him I entered the garden room that evening
from the door at the back, to cut a flower

70
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:58,539
for my mother.

71
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:04,370
Tell him I saw him and Miss Ashburton beneath
the pink oleander bush.

72
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:11,220
It was a pretty picture indeed, but the juxtaposition
told the whole story without the need for

73
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,659
a single word.

74
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:20,639
I left the garden room at once, without the
flower, and with my ideals broken into a hundred

75
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,020
thousand pieces.

76
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,259
You may take that song and dance to your dancing
teacher.'

77
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,259
'Juxta...

78
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,259
juxta?

79
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,550
Help me out, lady,' said the boy.

80
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,120
'Give me an easier word, will yer?'

81
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:45,780
'Juxtaposition... or, if you like, closeness
- the kind of closeness that can destroy an

82
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,580
ideal in a second.'

83
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,969
At once the boy turned and ran back to the
other bench.

84
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:56,379
The young man's eyes questioned him, hungrily.

85
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:01,120
The boy's eyes shone with excitement at his
new job as translator.

86
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,629
'The lady says that she knows that girls just
can't stop listenin' when a guy comes tellin'

87
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:11,490
stories and tryin' to be real nice and friendly.

88
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,110
That's why she won't listen to no sweet words
from yer.

89
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:21,569
She says she caught yer in the hothouse under
the flowers with yer arms around a girl.

90
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:27,029
She just stepped in the back to get a flower
for her ma, and yer was holdin' this other

91
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,449
girl real nice and close.

92
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:36,919
She says it looked pretty, all right all right,
but the juxta... but it made her sick.

93
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:42,279
She says yer gotta get busy and get off and
get that train real quick.'

94
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:49,310
The young man's eyes opened wide and his eyes
lit up with a sudden thought.

95
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:56,370
His hand flew to the inside pocket of his
coat, and pulled out a handful of letters.

96
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:04,270
Choosing one, he gave it to the boy, together
with a silver dollar from another pocket.

97
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,939
'Give that letter to the lady,' he said, 'and
ask her to read it.

98
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:13,749
Tell her that it should explain everything.

99
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:20,569
Tell her that she needs another ideal - she
must learn to trust, and that trust can prevent

100
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:23,840
much unnecessary heartache.

101
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,820
Tell her that her ideals are not broken.

102
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,320
Tell her that the true and loyal person is
still true and loyal, and has not changed

103
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,900
in any way.

104
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,550
Tell her I am waiting for an answer.'

105
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,740
The messenger stood before the lady again.

106
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:51,649
'The guy says there's been bad things said
about him, and it ain't right, it ain't just.

107
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:53,510
He says he ain't a bad guy.

108
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:03,410
And, lady, yer read that letter, and you're
goin' to see that he's all right, all right.'

109
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,740
The young lady took the letter.

110
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,890
She seemed unsure about it, but she opened
it, and read it.

111
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,250
Dear Dr Arnold

112
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:21,740
I want to thank you for the very kind help
that you gave to my daughter last Friday evening,

113
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,959
when she became suddenly ill with her old
heart trouble in the garden room at Mrs Waldron's

114
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,480
party.

115
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,930
It was so lucky that you were near enough
to catch her as she fell, and were able to

116
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,980
give her a doctor's care at once.

117
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,279
We are sure that you saved her life.

118
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,709
I would be happy if you would visit us soon
as her doctor.

119
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,500
Gratefully yours,

120
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,529
Robert Ashburton

121
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:54,910
The young lady closed the letter, and gave
it back to the boy.

122
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,070
'The guy wants an answer,' said the messenger.

123
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,990
'What's the word, lady?'

124
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,950
The lady's eyes were suddenly very bright
and smiling.

125
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:15,089
'Tell that guy on the other bench,' she said,
with a happy, shaky little laugh, 'that his

126
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,860
girl wants him.'
