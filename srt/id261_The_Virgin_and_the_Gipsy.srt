1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
The Virgin and the Gipsy

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,080
Lucille and Yvette Saywell were sisters.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:12,560
When Lucille was nine years old and Yvette was 
seven, a shocking thing happened in their family.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,560
Their mother, Cynthia, left their father 
and ran away with a young, poor man.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,440
The sisters' father, Arthur Saywell, was a vicar.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,440
He was a handsome man and a good husband.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,560
The vicar's neighbours were very surprised.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,440
Why had the vicar's wife left him?

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,120
Lucille and Yvette did not know 
why their mother had gone away.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,640
Perhaps she did not love them.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,200
Perhaps they had not been good daughters.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,800
The vicar was offered a job 
as rector of Papplewick,  

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,120
a small village in the north of England.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,280
So the family went to live in the rectory, 
which stood just outside the village.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,200
The rectory was an ugly stone house, with 
the River Papple running just beside it.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,440
The rector's mother, and his sister Aunt Cissie,  

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,360
came to live with the rector 
and his two daughters.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,520
The rector's mother - or Granny, as the girls 
called her - was over seventy years old.

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,160
The rector was very upset that his wife had left.

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,440
So Granny never spoke about Cynthia to her son.

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,880
But, secretly, the old woman was 
pleased that Cynthia had run away.

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,960
Granny was now the most 
important person in the house.

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,320
She controlled everybody else so 
that they did what she wanted.

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,320
She liked controlling the family very much.

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,440
If Cynthia came back, everything would change.

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,920
And Granny did not want that to happen.

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,840
Lucille and Yvette remembered their 
first home in the south, very clearly.

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,920
They also remembered their mother.

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,640
She had been like the sun.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,680
She was beautiful and bright, but also dangerous.

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,960
She had brought light and life to the 
house, but she had also been selfish.

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,800
As Granny grew older, she became almost blind.

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,280
She could not read and somebody had to lead 
her about because she could see very little.

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,520
She did not get out of her bed until midday, but 
she controlled all the other people in the house.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,040
The rector especially loved 
his younger daughter, Yvette.

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,120
Yvette was like her mother in many ways.

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,680
She was beautiful but careless.

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,120
The rector spoiled Yvette.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,000
And he let her do everything that she wanted.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,720
So, as Yvette grew up, she did not care 
very much about other people's feelings.

41
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,520
The rector's sister, Aunt 
Cissie, was almost fifty.

42
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,440
She spent all her time taking care of Granny.

43
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,040
Cissie did not complain, 
but inside she felt angry.

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,360
She had no life of her own and no future.

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,040
She had no time for herself.

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,320
And she had nothing to look forward to.

47
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,480
Yvette was young and beautiful.

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,760
She never tried to understand 
Aunt Cissie's feelings.

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,640
So Aunt Cissie was jealous 
of Yvette and hated her.

50
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,720
When they had finished their education in England,  

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,560
Lucille and Yvette were sent to a 
school in Switzerland for a year.

52
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,000
They returned to the rectory at Papplewick when 
Lucille was twenty-one and Yvette was nineteen.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,400
They were tall, attractive young 
girls with fresh, bright faces.

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,720
Their hair was cut short in the modern style.

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,360
It was a summer day and Yvette and 
Lucille were coming back to England.

56
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,280
They were crossing the 
Channel by boat from France.

57
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,720
The girls were not looking 
forward to living at the rectory.

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,000
'Papplewick is such a boring place,' said Yvette.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,360
'There are no interesting young 
men living near the village.'

60
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,120
'Yes, there are!' said Lucille.

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,920
'The Framley family lives in the village 
and Bob Framley is a nice young man.

62
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,160
And you know that Gerry Somercotes adores you.'

63
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,120
'But men who adore me are 
very boring,' said Yvette.

64
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,160
'I would like to fall deeply in love.'

65
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,840
'I wouldn't,' said Lucille.

66
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,720
'I would hate to fall in love.

67
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,320
Perhaps you would hate it too, if it happened.'

68
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,000
'But won't you hate to go back 
to Papplewick?' said Yvette.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,680
'Not really,' said Lucille.

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,960
'But I suppose that we'll get rather bored there.

71
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,400
I wish that Daddy would buy a car.

72
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,080
We'll have to ride our bicycles everywhere.'

73
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,560
As the ship came closer to 
the south coast of England,  

74
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,440
Yvette and Lucille watched the cliffs of Dover.

75
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,440
The walls of rock were usually 
white when the sun shone.

76
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:29,760
But today, the sky was grey and dull, 
and the cliffs were grey and dull too.

77
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,920
The two girls looked tall and confident.

78
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,880
But they were just young girls 
who knew nothing about life.

79
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,960
They were like ships that were moving from a 
safe harbour onto the wide and dangerous sea.

80
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,720
As soon as they went inside the rectory, 
Lucille and Yvette felt depressed.

81
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,320
The hard stonewalls seemed ugly and unclean.

82
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,120
The furniture seemed ugly and unclean too.

83
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,120
Nothing was fresh.

84
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,160
The food they ate was terrible.

85
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,920
Granny was given special things to eat.

86
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:12,640
And grey-faced Aunt Cissie ate very 
little - only one boiled potato at dinner.

87
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,680
She never ate meat.

88
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,080
Cissie hated food and eating.

89
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,360
Granny was now over eighty years old.

90
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,320
It was easy for her to control her son.

91
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,960
When Arthur Saywell's marriage went wrong,  

92
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,520
he had realized that life outside the 
family could be difficult and dangerous.

93
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,920
Only life inside the family was safe.

94
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:43,440
So he stayed close to the family and his mother 
- the most important person in the house.

95
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,560
The countryside round the village 
of Papplewick was dark and dull,  

96
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,120
with steep hills and deep, narrow valleys.

97
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,280
All the houses in the village were made of stone.

98
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,160
Life in Papplewick was as dull as stone too.

99
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,480
Lucille got a job in the city as a secretary.

100
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,200
She travelled to and from 
the city every day, by train.

101
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,080
Both girls helped the poorer 
people in the village.

102
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,560
But Yvette left the rectory whenever she could.

103
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,680
Sometimes she had tea with the wives 
of men who worked in the factories.

104
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,520
She liked talking to the working men.

105
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Their world was very different 
from her own life in the rectory.

106
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,960
The months passed.

107
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,000
Yvette went to lots of parties and dances.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,160
Sometimes friends came in their 
cars and took her to the city.

109
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,800
But she never seemed to be really happy.

110
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,520
At home, she was often angry, 
and she was rude to Aunt Cissie.

111
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,920
The girls hated inviting 
their friends to the rectory.

112
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,640
There were only four rooms 
downstairs - the kitchen,  

113
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,760
the dining room, the rector's 
study and the drawing room.

114
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,480
The drawing room was the only room 
where a good hot fire was lit.

115
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,320
So Granny always sat in the drawing-room.

116
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,560
Whenever the girls brought their friends to the 
rectory, Granny was sitting in the drawing-room.

117
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,600
The girls never felt comfortable and they 
could not relax when Granny was there.

118
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,120
Granny liked meeting people.

119
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,200
She wanted to be introduced 
to all the girls' friends.

120
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,360
She wanted to know who the young people were.

121
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,680
She wanted to know where they came 
from and every detail of their lives.

122
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,280
When Granny had this information, 
she took control of the conversation.

123
00:08:52,280 --> 00:09:01,040
One afternoon, Lottie, Ella and Bob Framley - 
some of Yvette's friends - came to the house.

124
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,080
A young man called Leo Wetherell came too.

125
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,920
Granny had not met Leo before, so 
Yvette had to introduce him to her.

126
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,240
'Granny, this is Mr Wetherell.'

127
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,160
'Mr What-did-you-say?' shouted Granny.

128
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,480
'You must excuse me, I'm a little deaf.

129
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,560
I can't hear properly.'

130
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:37,440
She held her hand towards Leo Wetherell 
and stared at him with her blind old eyes.

131
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
Leo felt very uncomfortable.

132
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,440
'We want to go on a picnic tomorrow,' said Ella.

133
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,480
'We're going to Bonsall Head, in Leo's car.'

134
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,080
There was a wonderful view from the top 
of Bonsall Head, from this high hill,  

135
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,320
you could see across the 
countryside for miles around.

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,160
'Did you say Bonsall Head?' asked Granny.

137
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,520
'Yes.'

138
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,960
There was a silence.

139
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,880
'Did you say that you were 
going in a car?' asked Granny.

140
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,960
'Yes,' said Yvette.

141
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,680
'In Mr Wetherell's car.'

142
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,360
'I hope that he's a good driver,' said Granny.

143
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,000
'The road to Bonsall Head is very dangerous.'

144
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,440
'Leo is a very good driver,' said Yvette.

145
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,880
'Not a very good driver?' said Granny.

146
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,360
'He is a very good driver!' shouted Yvette.

147
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,200
Then Aunt Cissie came into the room.

148
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,360
Following her was the maid, who brought 
tea and a plate of little cakes.

149
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,200
Several minutes later, Lucille 
returned from her job in the town.

150
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,840
She was very tired and had 
black marks under her eyes.

151
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,840
When she saw all the people in the drawing 
room, she gave a little cry of surprise.

152
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:19,880
'You've never spoken about Mr Wetherell 
to me, have you, Lucille?' said Granny.

153
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,440
'I don't remember,' said Lucille.

154
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,320
'You can't have talked about him,' said Granny.

155
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,240
'I've never heard his name before.'

156
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,160
Yvette was eating the little cakes.

157
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,000
Without thinking about anyone else, 
she took another cake from the plate.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,840
Aunt Cissie felt very angry with Yvette.

159
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:52,160
She picked up her own plate, which had one 
small cake on it, and offered it to Yvette.

160
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,240
'Would you like my cake too?' she asked in a 
voice that was polite, but cold with anger.

161
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,800
'Oh, thanks!' said Yvette carelessly, 
taking Aunt Cissie's cake as well.

162
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,160
Now she had two cakes on her plate.

163
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,520
Aunt Cissie's face showed her 
feelings - feelings of hate.

164
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,080
But Yvette did not notice that anything was wrong.

165
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,480
Lucille and Yvette felt very 
tired when their friends left.

166
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,160
The conversation between their friends 
and Granny had been very difficult.

167
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,240
Yvette looked at her grandmother.

168
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,320
Granny looked like a kind, weak 
old lady, but she was very strong.

169
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,720
She wanted to control other people by 
knowing everything about their lives.

170
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,920
She was like a fat old toad that 
Yvette had seen in the garden one day.

171
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,240
The toad had sat by a bee-hive.

172
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,120
It had caught and eaten the bees 
as they came out of the hive.

173
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,040
Next day, the weather was dull and grey.

174
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,800
The roads were wet and slippery because 
it had rained for several weeks.

175
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,240
But the young people still wanted 
to drive up to Bonsall Head.

176
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,880
There were two men in the group 
- Leo Wetherell and Bob Framley.

177
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:25,920
And there were four girls - Lottie and Ella 
Framley, who were sisters, and Lucille and Yvette.

178
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,280
The young people all got into Leo's car.

179
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,320
As he drove through the quiet villages, 
they all talked and sang songs.

180
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,720
The car went along the road through dark trees,  

181
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,200
and then began the long slow 
climb up to Bonsall Head.

182
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,960
At the top of the hill, there were 
no trees, there was only grass.

183
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,520
On each side of the road there 
were low walls made of stone.

184
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,160
Above the hills, the sky was dull and grey.

185
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,680
'Shall we stay here for a moment?' 
said Leo, stopping the car.

186
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,720
'Oh, yes!' cried the girls.

187
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,040
Leo turned off the engine and 
they all got out of the car.

188
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,680
The view from the top of the Head was wonderful.

189
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,720
All around, they could see hills and deep valleys.

190
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,360
And towards the north, they saw a 
train moving slowly in the distance.

191
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,560
'Come on!' said Leo.

192
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,080
'Let's drive down to Amberdale and have some tea.'

193
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,560
The friends got back into the car 
and drove along the top of the Head.

194
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,280
They were so high that it was 
like being on top of the world.

195
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Up here, it was cold and windy.

196
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,440
The young people were silent, 
looking out across the stone walls.

197
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,480
Suddenly, ahead of them on the road, they 
saw a horse pulling a small green cart.

198
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,120
The cart was driven by a man, and an 
old woman was walking by its side.

199
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,360
Because the road was narrow, 
the car could not pass.

200
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,320
Leo sounded the horn sharply and 
the man on the cart looked round.

201
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,440
But the old woman walked on 
and did not turn her head.

202
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,400
Yvette's heart gave a jump.

203
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,680
The man on the cart was a gipsy.

204
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,960
He wore a dark green cap and a big red and 
yellow silk handkerchief around his neck.

205
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,000
He sat on the cart in a comfortable, relaxed way.

206
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,320
'Get out of the way!' shouted Leo angrily.

207
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,760
The man pulled the horse's 
reins and the cart stopped.

208
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,840
But it was still in the middle of 
the road and the car could not pass.

209
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,560
So Leo had to stop the car too.

210
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,920
'Would the pretty young ladies like to have 
their fortunes told?' said the gipsy, laughing.

211
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,960
'Would they like to know what will 
happen to them in the future?'

212
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:13,720
The gipsy was very handsome, with black hair 
and a black moustache above very white teeth.

213
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,520
His dark watchful eyes looked 
at Yvette's soft young face.

214
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,720
She looked into his eyes and felt 
a strange feeling of excitement.

215
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,560
It was like a little flame in her heart.

216
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,080
'He's very strong,' she thought.

217
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,360
'He's stronger than I am!'

218
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,920
'Oh, yes!' cried the girls.

219
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,400
'Let's have our fortunes told!'

220
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,280
'But what about the time?' cried Leo.

221
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,080
'It's getting late.'

222
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,080
'It doesn't matter about the time,' said Lucille.

223
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,880
The gipsy jumped down lightly from the cart.

224
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,640
He seemed a little over thirty 
years old and he was well dressed.

225
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,120
Beneath his black and green coat,  

226
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:10,840
he wore a dark green jumper, tight 
black trousers and black boots.

227
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:16,480
Now the young people saw that there was 
an old quarry on one side of the road.

228
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,920
Many years ago, men had cut rock out of the 
ground and an opening had been made in the hill.

229
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,120
There were three caravans in the quarry.

230
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,440
The wall of rock rose high above the 
caravans, curving round towards the road.

231
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,280
Grass grew between the rough stones on the ground.

232
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,600
The quarry was a good place 
for the gipsies winter camp.

233
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,680
The old gipsy woman went into one of the caravans.

234
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,400
Two black-haired children 
looked out of the open door.

235
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,160
The gipsy gave a call and an old man 
came to take the horse from the cart.

236
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,840
Then the gipsy went up the 
steps into the nearest caravan.

237
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,720
At the same moment, a tall and handsome 
gipsy woman came down the steps.

238
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:13,200
She had big gold rings in her ears and a 
pink headscarf over her black wavy hair.

239
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,320
She wore a large green skirt.

240
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,840
Her face was long and her eyes were 
bright and fierce, like a wolf.

241
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:30,200
'Which beautiful young lady wants to 
hear her fortune?' the woman asked.

242
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,960
'If she shows me her little 
hand, I can read her future.'

243
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,480
The woman's eyes looked sharply from face to face.

244
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:49,120
Yvette, Lucille, Lottie and Ella all wanted 
the gipsy woman to tell them their fortunes.

245
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:55,600
They agreed a price and the woman pulled 
two wooden stools from under a caravan.

246
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,680
The first girl, Lottie, sat down and the 
gipsy woman looked closely at her hand.

247
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,520
She told Lottie about her future life.

248
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,960
Yvette was the last girl to have her fortune told.

249
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,240
The gipsy woman stared into the girl's face.

250
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,640
'I don't think that I want my 
fortune told,' Yvette said nervously.

251
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,840
'Are you afraid?' asked the woman.

252
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:33,840
'Do you have a secret? Would you like to go 
into the caravan, where nobody can hear?'

253
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
'Yes!' said Yvette.

254
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,360
'I'll go into the caravan.'

255
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,200
The gipsy woman called something to her husband.

256
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,120
The gipsy man appeared at 
the top of the caravan steps.

257
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,400
He was holding a small, 
black-haired baby in his arms.

258
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,640
He came down the steps, 
looking at Yvette as he passed.

259
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,120
Yvette followed the woman 
up the steps of the caravan.

260
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,840
At the top, she turned towards her friends.

261
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,320
'I won't be long,' she said.

262
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,400
Yvette's coat had soft, grey 
animal's fur around the collar.

263
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:18,000
The collar was open, showing the white skin 
of her throat and her pale green dress.

264
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,720
She knew that the gipsy man was looking 
at her as she entered his house.

265
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,840
Yvette's friends waited for a long time.

266
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,640
It was getting dark and cold.

267
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,880
At last, the caravan door 
opened and Yvette came out.

268
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,800
The gipsy woman followed her.

269
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:42,560
'Was I away a long time?' asked 
Yvette, not looking at anybody.

270
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:48,640
'I hope that you weren't bored! 
Wouldn't tea be nice! Shall we go?'

271
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,360
'You get in the car,' said Bob Framley.

272
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,200
'I'll pay.'

273
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,920
He gave some money to the gipsy woman.

274
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:02,280
As Yvette got into the car, she also 
put some money into the woman's hand.

275
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,600
Leo started the engine and 
switched on the car's lights.

276
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,040
'Goodnight!' called Yvette.

277
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,240
As Leo turned the car onto the 
road, Lucille spoke to her sister.

278
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,840
'Yvette, tell us what the 
gipsy woman said to you.'

279
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,280
'Oh, nothing exciting,' said Yvette.

280
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,520
'Just the usual things.

281
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:33,840
My future will include a dark man who means 
good luck, and a fair one who means bad luck.

282
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,400
Someone in the family will die.

283
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,680
I'll marry when I'm twenty-three.

284
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,640
I'll have lots of money 
and love, and two children.

285
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,640
That's all!'

286
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,720
At the rectory a few days later, there was a 
big quarrel between Yvette and Aunt Cissie.

287
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,880
The quarrel was about Aunt Cissie's Window Fund.

288
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,720
Aunt Cissie had been collecting money to pay 
for a new, decorated glass window in the church.

289
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,440
This window was to remember the men from 
the village who had died in the war.

290
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,680
Aunt Cissie had asked Lucille and Yvette 
to collect money for the Window Fund too.

291
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,040
She gave each of them a special moneybox.

292
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,640
The quarrel started when Aunt Cissie asked 
the girls for the money from their boxes.

293
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,520
There was very little money in 
Yvette's box, only fifteen shillings.

294
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,760
'But some money must be missing.

295
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,960
Where is the rest of it?' asked Aunt Cissie.

296
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,560
'Oh,' said Yvette carelessly.

297
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,480
'I borrowed it.'

298
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,280
Aunt Cissie was very angry with Yvette.

299
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,200
Yvette's father, the rector, was angry too.

300
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,920
'If you needed money, why 
didn't you tell me?' he said.

301
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,160
'I - I thought that it didn't 
matter,' said Yvette nervously.

302
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,280
'I needed to buy some things for myself.

303
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,000
I can pay it back.'

304
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,120
'And what have you spent the 
money on?' her father asked.

305
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,080
'I can't remember,' said Yvette.

306
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,040
'I gave some of it away.'

307
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,760
Yvette's face was very pale.

308
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,960
The rector was afraid that Yvette 
was becoming like his wife, Cynthia.

309
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,440
She had behaved in the same 
careless way as Yvette.

310
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,000
Now Yvette looked at him in the 
same way that Cynthia had done.

311
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,040
Arthur Saywell felt guilty and afraid.

312
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,360
'You must give the money back to 
the Window Fund,' he said coldly.

313
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,000
'I'll lend you some money now 
so that you can pay it back.

314
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,080
In the future, if you can't trust yourself, 
don't touch money which isn't yours.

315
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,480
You have not been honest.

316
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,000
Dishonesty is a terrible thing.'

317
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,440
Yvette felt very bad.

318
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,640
She knew that she had done wrong.

319
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,720
She had been dishonest.

320
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,880
She had taken money, which was 
not hers, and she had spent it.

321
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,480
Why had she touched the money?

322
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,800
The rector paid the missing money to Aunt Cissie.

323
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,680
But Aunt Cissie could not forgive Yvette.

324
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,360
One night, when Yvette had gone 
to bed, her door opened softly.

325
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:36,040
Aunt Cissie stood in the doorway of the 
bedroom, pushing her grey-green face forward.

326
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,960
Terrified, Yvette sat up in her bed.

327
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:48,560
'Liar! Thief! Selfish little creature!' 
said Aunt Cissie in a voice full of hate.

328
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,600
'You're a selfish, greedy little thief!'

329
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,240
Yvette opened her mouth to scream.

330
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,320
But Aunt Cissie shut the door and disappeared.

331
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,560
Yvette jumped out of bed 
and locked the bedroom door.

332
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:11,440
She slowly got back into the bed 
and lay there, almost mad with fear.

333
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,920
'I wish that I were a gipsy,' she said to herself.

334
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,040
'I want to live in a camp, or a caravan.

335
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,680
I never want to go into a house again.

336
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,800
I hate this house.

337
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,960
There's no fresh air here.

338
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,240
I want to live my life freely.

339
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,440
I want to live in the fresh air, like a gipsy.'

340
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,680
Then Yvette thought about the gipsy 
woman who had told her fortune.

341
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,680
She remembered the woman's words:

342
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,960
'There's a dark man who never lived in a house.

343
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,400
He loves you.

344
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,520
Other people are treading on your heart.

345
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,720
They will tread on your heart 
until you think that it's dead.

346
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:11,080
But the dark man will blow the spark 
of life into fire again - a good fire.'

347
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,280
Yvette hated the cold rectory.

348
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:20,160
She liked the big dark gipsy woman 
who had gold rings in her ears.

349
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,080
She liked the woman's strong hands.

350
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,800
And the gipsy man!

351
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:32,200
Yvette remembered the way that he had 
looked at her, and her body shook.

352
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,320
She had given two pounds from the 
Window Fund to the gipsy woman.

353
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,640
She never told her father or Aunt Cissie this.

354
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,840
For several days, the weather was cold and wet.

355
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:52,640
One afternoon, Lucille had a half 
day's holiday from her job in the city.

356
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,880
The rector was writing in his study.

357
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,040
Granny, Lucille and Yvette 
were in the drawing room.

358
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,280
The girls were making a blue dress for Yvette.

359
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,320
Granny was resting on the couch.

360
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,080
Yvette was sitting at the table, sewing her dress.

361
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,000
The room was very untidy.

362
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,720
There were small pieces of 
blue material everywhere  

363
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,760
and the scissors were lying on the floor.

364
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,280
Yvette had placed a mirror 
on the top of the piano.

365
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,160
But she had placed it in such a 
careless way that it could easily fall.

366
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,880
Aunt Cissie came into the room.

367
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,840
'This room is in a terrible mess!' she said.

368
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,000
'You'll have to clear these things away, Yvette.'

369
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,400
'I'll clear everything away before 
we have tea,' Yvette replied.

370
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,600
She got up and pulled the 
half-made blue dress over her head.

371
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:57,560
But as she did so, she knocked the mirror off 
the top of the piano and it fell to the floor.

372
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,280
Luckily the mirror did not break.

373
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,440
But everybody got a terrible shock.

374
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,840
'Oh! She's smashed the mirror!' cried Aunt Cissie.

375
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,600
'It's broken!'

376
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,480
'Smashed a mirror! Which mirror! Who's 
smashed it?' said Granny sharply.

377
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,400
'I haven't smashed anything,' said Yvette calmly.

378
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
'It's all right.

379
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,080
Anyway, it's my own mirror.

380
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,200
I brought it from our home at the vicarage.'

381
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,800
'Don't break it in this house, 
wherever it came from,' said Granny.

382
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,200
'It's very unlucky to break a mirror.

383
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,040
I don't want any bad luck brought to this house.'

384
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,920
'Oh, I'm not superstitious,' said Yvette.

385
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,600
'I don't believe that breaking 
a mirror will bring bad luck.'

386
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:57,720
'Yvette, will you please tidy this mess and 
put your things away,' said Aunt Cissie.

387
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,040
'It's really terrible to live with people who are  

388
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:08,160
always making a fuss about small 
things!' cried Yvette angrily.

389
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,680
'Which people are you talking 
about?' said Aunt Cissie.

390
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,520
'You know who I'm talking about,' said Yvette.

391
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,680
'I'm talking about the 
people in this awful house.'

392
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,360
'Well,' said Granny.

393
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:31,280
'Thank goodness that there's nobody evil 
or mad, like your mother, in our family.'

394
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,800
For a second, there was a terrible silence.

395
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,400
Then Lucille stood up quickly.

396
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,880
'You shut up!' she shouted at Granny.

397
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,280
Aunt Cissie angrily jumped towards Lucille 
and began to push her out of the room.

398
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,400
'Go to your bedroom!' she cried.

399
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,120
'Stay in your room until 
you've apologized to Granny.

400
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,200
Say that you're sorry, then you can leave!'

401
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,440
'I shall not apologize!' shouted 
Lucille, and she left the room.

402
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,200
Yvette stood in the centre of the drawing room.

403
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,000
She was still wearing the half-made blue dress.

404
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,960
She was shocked by what 
Lucille had said to Granny.

405
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,560
But she was also very angry with Granny.

406
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,920
The rector came in.

407
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,200
'What's wrong?' he asked.

408
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,400
'Oh, nothing!' said Yvette carelessly.

409
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,040
'Lucille told Granny to shut up 
when she was saying something.'

410
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,480
'Lucille must learn to control 
her nerves,' said Granny.

411
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,440
'The mirror fell down, and it worried me.

412
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:53,000
Yvette said something about superstitions 
and the people in this awful house.

413
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,040
I said that the people in this 
house weren't evil or mad.

414
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,160
Then Lucille told me to shut up.

415
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,920
But it's only because of her nerves.'

416
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,280
Yvette was shocked.

417
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,960
Granny was not telling the rector the truth.

418
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,120
Granny had said that the 
girls' mother was evil and mad.

419
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,560
Aunt Cissie came back into the room.

420
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:26,240
'I've told Lucille not to come out of her 
room, until she apologizes,' she said.

421
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,640
'I don't want an apology,' said the old lady.

422
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,280
'Lucille's nerves made her behave like that.'

423
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:43,200
Yvette's body was shaking inside as she collected 
her thread, scissors and other sewing things.

424
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,360
She went up the stairs to see Lucille.

425
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Halfway up the stairs, there was a window.

426
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,840
Yvette always looked out of this window, 
hoping to see someone on the road.

427
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,240
The rectory was beside the River Papple.

428
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:05,440
The road curved round the bouse, down to the 
bridge over the river, and on up to the village.

429
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,960
A horse, pulling a green cart, 
was coming down the road.

430
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,800
It was driven by a man who was 
sitting on the front of the cart.

431
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,680
He was wearing a green cap.

432
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,880
It was the gipsy.

433
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,200
At of the cart, there were metal 
pots and pans and long brushes.

434
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,920
The gipsy crossed the bridge, and passed 
along the road by the rectory wall.

435
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:36,520
He looked up at the old stone house 
and saw Yvette standing at the window.

436
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,720
He nodded his head to her.

437
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,600
Yvette was still wearing the blue 
dress, but it had no sleeves.

438
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,840
Because she was a little cold, Yvette 
rubbed her hands along her pale arms.

439
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:57,080
The gipsy stopped at the white gate of the 
rectory, and jumped down from the cart.

440
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:03,480
He took some brushes and other things from the 
back of the cart and turned towards the house.

441
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,240
He looked up at Yvette as he opened the gate.

442
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,040
Yvette hurried to the bathroom 
and put on her other dress.

443
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,280
Then she went downstairs to the drawing room.

444
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,560
The maid arrived there at the same time.

445
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,280
'Aunt Cissie,' Yvette said.

446
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,280
'There's a man selling brushes at the door.

447
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,840
Shall I go and see him?'

448
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,480
'What kind of a man is he?' asked Aunt Cissie.

449
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,960
'A man with a cart,' said Yvette.

450
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,200
'A gipsy,' said the maid, 
coming into the drawing-room.

451
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Aunt Cissie stood up.

452
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,800
She wanted to see the gipsy herself.

453
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:50,200
The gipsy stood at the door, 
holding his brushes in one hand.

454
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:57,720
From his other hand, shining metal objects were 
hanging - a saucepan, a candlestick and plates.

455
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,160
He looked at Aunt Cissie with his large dark eyes.

456
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:10,000
'Do you want to buy anything today, 
lady?' he asked in a soft, quiet voice.

457
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,680
Aunt Cissie saw that he was very 
handsome, so she did not close the door.

458
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,440
'This candlestick is lovely,' said Yvette.

459
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,720
'Did you make it?'

460
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,040
'Yes, lady!'

461
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,400
The gipsy looked at Yvette and his 
eyes showed his feelings for her.

462
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,720
She knew that he wanted her.

463
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,920
He desired her.

464
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,400
It made her feel weak.

465
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Aunt Cissie went to show the rector the  

466
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,840
candlestick and Yvette was 
left alone with the gipsy.

467
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,480
'How is your wife?' she asked.

468
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,680
The man looked at Yvette and smiled.

469
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,680
'She's all right,' he said.

470
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:59,920
'When are you coming to the quarry 
again?' he asked in a low voice.

471
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,080
'Oh, I don't know,' said Yvette carelessly.

472
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,440
'Come on a Friday, when I'm there,' he said.

473
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,720
Yvette looked over the 
gipsy's shoulder at the road.

474
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,960
She pretended that she had not heard his words.

475
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Aunt Cissie returned with 
money to buy the candlestick.

476
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,960
Yvette turned away and went upstairs.

477
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,800
She stood beside the window on the 
stairs and looked onto the road.

478
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,440
She did not want the gipsy to see her.

479
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,560
She wanted to know if he had any power over her.

480
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,080
Did he control her feelings and her mind?

481
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,600
She watched the gipsy walk through 
the white gate to the cart.

482
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:51,040
He put his brushes and pans 
away and jumped onto the cart.

483
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,960
Then he was gone.

484
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,880
'No, he hasn't any power over me!' said Yvette.

485
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,040
And she went to see Lucille.

486
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,680
'Granny is sorry about what happened,' she said.

487
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,320
'Don't be angry.

488
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,400
Let's go down to dinner.

489
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,160
Come on, Lucille!'

490
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,560
When Friday came, Yvette thought all day 
about the quarry high up on Bonsall Head.

491
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,960
She wanted to be there, among 
the caravans with the gipsies.

492
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,920
But she did not go.

493
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,160
She stayed at home and sewed her 
blue dress for a party the next day.

494
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,600
She danced with Leo Wetherell at the party.

495
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,040
'Why don't we get engaged, Yvette?' asked Leo.

496
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,440
Leo was an ordinary young man.

497
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,880
But he was pleasant and kind, and he was rich.

498
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,960
Yvette quite liked him.

499
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,880
But she did not want to get engaged to him.

500
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,520
What a silly idea! She did not 
think about Leo's feelings at all.

501
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,240
'Get engaged!' she said.

502
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,160
'But that's impossible.'

503
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,200
'Since those gipsies told your fortune, I've 
felt that I am the only one for you,' said Leo.

504
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,040
'And you are the only one for me.'

505
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,200
'Really!' said Yvette, very surprised.

506
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,760
'Really!'

507
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,440
'You felt the same thing, didn't you?' he said.

508
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,720
'Do you feel the same about 
me, as I feel about you?'

509
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,320
'What? Do you think that I 
want to get engaged?' she said.

510
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,480
'No.

511
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,360
How could I dream of such an impossible thing?'

512
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,560
The musicians began to play again 
and people stood up to dance.

513
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,440
Leo looked at Yvette.

514
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,480
'I won't dance anymore,' she said.

515
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,920
'But do go and ask somebody 
else to dance with you.'

516
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,440
Leo stood up angrily and walked away from her.

517
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,880
Yvette watched the young men dancing.

518
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,120
Then suddenly a picture of 
the gipsy came into her mind.

519
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:13,720
She saw his face, his straight 
nose, his smiling lips.

520
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:21,560
She saw his black eyes, which seemed to look 
deep into a dark, secret place inside her.

521
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,360
The gipsy was so different 
from the young men around her.

522
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,440
Yvette did not want any of them.

523
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:37,080
When Leo smiled at her, his smile did 
not make a flame burn in her heart.

524
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,080
The next week, it rained again.

525
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,720
But when Friday came, it was sunny and cold.

526
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,800
Yvette told her family that she was 
going for a ride on her bicycle.

527
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,960
But she did not tell them that she 
was going to visit the gipsies camp.

528
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,960
It was February and the sun was not strong 
enough to melt the ice on the ground.

529
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,120
But the sun made Yvette think of spring.

530
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:10,360
Her body was warm from cycling, 
but her hands were very cold.

531
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,800
She was not wearing gloves.

532
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,280
The horse and cart were not in the camp.

533
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,000
The gipsy man was sitting on 
the ground, making a metal bowl.

534
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,800
He was not wearing a coat or a cap.

535
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,360
The sun shone on his black hair and green jumper.

536
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,640
An old woman was cooking some 
food in an iron pot over the fire.

537
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,400
Three small children were playing near her.

538
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,720
The man looked up as Yvette got off her bicycle.

539
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,600
'How are you all?' she asked politely.

540
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,520
'All right.

541
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:57,320
Do you want to sit down for a minute?' he said, 
pulling a wooden stool from under a caravan.

542
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,880
Yvette went to the fire to 
warm her hands near the flames.

543
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,160
'Are you cooking dinner?' she asked the old woman.

544
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,880
'Yes,' the woman replied.

545
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,680
'Dinner for him.

546
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,480
And for the children.'

547
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,080
She pointed at the three 
black-eyed, black-haired children.

548
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,560
They were staring at Yvette.

549
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,320
The gipsies, their caravans and 
everything in the camp was clean and tidy.

550
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,720
'Are they your children?' 
Yvette asked the gipsy man.

551
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,120
He looked straight into her eyes, and nodded.

552
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,040
'Where's your wife?'

553
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,720
'She's taken the cart, to try and sell things.

554
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,960
I don't go selling things.

555
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,360
I make them, but I don't go selling them.

556
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,440
Not often.'

557
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,240
Yvette sat down on the stool.

558
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,360
'You said that you would be 
here on a Friday,' she said.

559
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,800
'And the weather was fine today.

560
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,040
So I came this way.'

561
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,280
'It's a very fine day!' said the gipsy.

562
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:18,320
'Do you want some dinner? There's 
meat with some beans in it.'

563
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,560
'Yes, please.

564
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,840
I'll have just a little,' said Yvette.

565
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,240
'Do you want to come up into the 
caravan and wash your hands?'

566
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,920
'No, thank you,' she said.

567
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
'They're clean.'

568
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,360
They ate the food, sitting round the fire.

569
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:43,760
The children sat on the ground, eating beans 
and meat with a spoon or their fingers.

570
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,480
The gipsy man was silent.

571
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,200
Then the old woman made some coffee.

572
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,960
Yvette took off her hat and shook her 
short, brown hair in the sunshine.

573
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,320
'How many children do you 
have?' Yvette asked suddenly.

574
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:06,800
'Five, I think,' replied the gipsy 
slowly, looking up into her eyes.

575
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,240
He held a cup of coffee 
towards her and she took it.

576
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:16,840
She knew that he was sitting 
there silently, like a shadow.

577
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,240
Yvette's hair fell across her face 
as she put her lips to the hot cup.

578
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,400
She felt very weak, as if the 
gipsy had complete power over her.

579
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,880
And as he drank his own coffee, he looked at her.

580
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,680
'Do you want to go to my caravan 
now, and wash your hands?' he said.

581
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,880
'Yes, I think so,' she said.

582
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,880
He got up quietly.

583
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,920
Then he spoke a few words to the old woman 
and climbed up the steps to his caravan.

584
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,200
Yvette stood still at the bottom of the steps.

585
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,520
Suddenly they heard the sound of a car.

586
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,640
A big, powerful car passed 
the quarry, then stopped.

587
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,640
The gipsy came down the 
steps of the caravan again.

588
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,080
'Put on your hat,' he said to Yvette.

589
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,880
Yvette went back to the stool by the fire.

590
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,200
The gipsy picked up his tools and 
began working on the metal bowl again.

591
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,880
'May we warm our hands at 
the camp fire?' said a voice.

592
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,840
A small woman came towards the fire.

593
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,920
She was wearing a fur coat, but 
her body was shaking with the cold.

594
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,200
A large, fair-haired man was following her.

595
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,320
He was tall and strong, with 
a body like an athlete's.

596
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,360
The woman sat at the fire and held 
her hands towards the warm flames.

597
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,560
The gipsy was still making his metal bowl.

598
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,800
The big blond man went over to him.

599
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,840
'We're on our honeymoon,' 
the woman said to Yvette.

600
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,040
'But it's a honeymoon before we're married!'

601
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,600
'Really!' said Yvette.

602
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,520
She was surprised.

603
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,960
'Yes! Have you heard of Simon 
Fawcett?' the woman asked.

604
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,760
She was talking about a rich, 
well-known engineer in northern England.

605
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,080
'Well, I'm Mrs Fawcett.

606
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,400
My husband is divorcing me.

607
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,080
As soon as the divorce is complete, I'm 
going to marry this man - Major Eastwood.'

608
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:28,760
She turned round and looked at the large 
blond man who was talking to the gipsy.

609
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,760
Then she looked at the gipsy.

610
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,720
Her big brown eyes shone.

611
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,960
'He's a handsome man!' she said.

612
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,280
'Yes, quite handsome!' said Yvette.

613
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:48,440
'Are you cycling?' asked the woman, 
looking at Yvette's bicycle by the caravan.

614
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,160
'Yes.

615
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,880
I'm going down to Papplewick,' replied Yvette.

616
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,440
'My father is the rector of Papplewick.'

617
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,160
Major Eastwood came and stood by the fire.

618
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,520
'We were talking about the war,' he said.

619
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,480
'I thought that I remembered that man's face.

620
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,720
He served in my regiment.

621
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,720
He took care of the horses.

622
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,640
He was excellent.'

623
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,360
'Why don't you come with us in our 
car?' said the woman to Yvette.

624
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,360
'We live in Scoresby.

625
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,360
That's near Papplewick.

626
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,960
We can tie your bicycle onto the back of the car.'

627
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,520
'Thank you.

628
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,760
I think that I will,' said Yvette.

629
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,520
'It's going to snow,' said the woman, 
looking up at the cold, grey sky.

630
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,960
She closed the collar of her 
fur coat around her neck.

631
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:49,040
'Are you going back in the car?' 
the gipsy asked, looking at Yvette.

632
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,280
'Yes,' she replied.

633
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,120
'The weather changes very quickly.'

634
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,760
Yvette did not know what the gipsy was thinking.

635
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,520
But she was not very interested.

636
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,160
She was more interested in Mrs Fawcett.

637
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,280
This woman had left her rich husband 
and had run away with Major Eastwood,  

638
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,760
a poor man who was five or 
six years younger than her.

639
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,200
'Well, goodbye!' said Mrs Fawcett to the gipsy.

640
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,400
'Thank you for the warm fire.'

641
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,960
'Fire is free for everyone,' said the gipsy.

642
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,320
'Goodbye!' said Yvette.

643
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,480
'I hope that it doesn't snow.'

644
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,240
'We don't worry about a 
little snow,' said the gipsy.

645
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:43,240
And Yvette followed the woman 
in the fur coat to the car.

646
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,040
Yvette was excited about her new friends.

647
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,760
She called them the Eastwoods.

648
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,840
They were renting a small cottage near the hills.

649
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,560
Mrs Eastwood was thirty-six.

650
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,400
She had two children, who were 
both more than twelve years old.

651
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,080
She had left them with her husband.

652
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,800
But Mr Fawcett had agreed that the children could  

653
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,240
live with their mother when 
the divorce was complete.

654
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,480
The Eastwoods were a strange couple.

655
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,960
Mrs Eastwood was a tiny woman, 
with big eyes and curly black hair.

656
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,600
Major Charles Eastwood 
looked completely different.

657
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:29,080
He was a big young man with bright 
blond hair and light grey eyes.

658
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,440
He looked like a great, pale bird of winter.

659
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,320
The Eastwoods invited Yvette 
for a meal at their cottage.

660
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:43,160
Yvette thought that they were very 
unusual and interesting people.

661
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:50,920
She told Lucille about her new friends, but she 
did not tell the rector, Granny, or Aunt Cissie.

662
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,880
She knew that they would 
ask her a lot of questions.

663
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,640
'But I don't want you to visit 
us if your father doesn't know  

664
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,480
about our friendship,' said Mrs Eastwood.

665
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,680
'I'm sure that he won't worry,' said Yvette.

666
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,440
Yvette talked about many 
things with the Eastwoods.

667
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,760
On one visit, they talked about love and marriage.

668
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,720
'Don't you want to fall in love and 
get married?' asked Mrs Eastwood.

669
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,360
'No, not really,' said Yvette.

670
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,720
'But don't you know what love is?' 
said Mrs Eastwood in surprise.

671
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,200
'Is there no man who makes you feel different?'

672
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,160
'I don't think so,' said Yvette.

673
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:45,160
'Except - yes! There is one man 
who makes me feel different.

674
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,840
The gipsy.'

675
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,800
'What gipsy?'

676
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,960
'The one who was a soldier and cared for the 
horses in Major Eastwood's regiment in the war.'

677
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:01,120
'You're not in love with him!' said 
Mrs Eastwood in a shocked voice.

678
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,240
'Well!' said Yvette.

679
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,840
'I don't know.

680
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,840
He's the only man who makes me feel different.

681
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,560
He really is!

682
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:14,000
He looked at me in a different 
way from any other man.

683
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,920
He looked as if he really 
desired me - really wanted me.'

684
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,400
'What a horrible man!' cried Mrs Eastwood.

685
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,080
'Do you think that he shouldn't 
look at me?' asked Yvette.

686
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:34,160
'No! He certainly should not!' cried Mrs Eastwood.

687
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,680
'But it was rather wonderful.

688
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,200
It really was!' said Yvette.

689
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,680
'And nothing like that has happened in my life.'

690
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:50,840
'I think,' said the Major, 'that desire 
for a woman is the most wonderful thing.'

691
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:55,960
'Do you think that the gipsy 
is special?' asked Yvette.

692
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,600
'If I were you, I should know,' said the Major.

693
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:08,800
'But she can't possibly marry him and live in a 
caravan!' said Mrs Eastwood in a shocked voice.

694
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,480
'I never said that she should 
marry him,' said Major Eastwood.

695
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,160
'And she shouldn't have a love 
affair,' said Mrs Eastwood.

696
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,440
Major Eastwood thought for several moments.

697
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,200
'That gipsy was the best man that we 
had who worked with horses,' he said.

698
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,920
'He became ill and almost died.

699
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,360
I almost died too.

700
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,720
I was buried for twenty hours under snow.

701
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,120
I was only found by accident.'

702
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,480
'Oh,' said Yvette.

703
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,200
'Life is so terrible.'

704
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,440
Yvette had thought that her father would not 
worry about her friendship with the Eastwoods.

705
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,960
But when the rector heard 
about them, he was very angry.

706
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,280
'I've heard that your new friends 
are the half-divorced Mrs Fawcett  

707
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,840
and her boyfriend, Eastwood,' he said.

708
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,600
'They're very nice,' said Yvette.

709
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,160
'They'll be married in about a month.

710
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,440
I like them very much.

711
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,360
They both seem such honest people.'

712
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,480
'You've got a strange idea 
about honesty,' said the rector.

713
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,360
'Eastwood is a young man who lives 
with a woman older than himself.

714
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,800
He lives on her money.

715
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,240
The woman has left her home and her children!

716
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,640
And you seem to know them very well.

717
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,240
Where did you meet them?'

718
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,680
'I was riding my bicycle,' said Yvette.

719
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,520
'I met them on the road.

720
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:54,040
They came along in their 
car and we started to talk.'

721
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,520
'And how many times have you visited them?'

722
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,880
'I've been to their cottage in Scoresby twice.'

723
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,960
The rector looked at Yvette with hate in his eyes.

724
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,360
He remembered his wife Cynthia.

725
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,280
Cynthia had behaved like Mrs Eastwood.

726
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:21,080
Cynthia had left him and run 
away with a younger, poor man.

727
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,880
His daughter liked the Eastwoods.

728
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,520
She did not think that their behaviour was wrong.

729
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,040
Was Yvette becoming like Cynthia?

730
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:37,760
'Yvette, why do you make friends with 
people like the Eastwoods?' he said.

731
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:44,560
'Aren't there enough good people in the world 
for you? You must stop this kind of behaviour.

732
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:49,520
Or you will have to live with mad, bad people.'

733
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,560
Yvette's face became pale.

734
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,640
She felt cold with fear.

735
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,560
'But why?' she said.

736
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:04,160
'What have I done? Is it a very bad 
thing, to be friends with the Eastwoods?'

737
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,720
'Don't say anymore,' said the rector.

738
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:12,080
'I'll kill you, before you go down 
the same bad road as your mother.'

739
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,960
Yvette looked at her father.

740
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:24,600
The skin of his face was pale yellow, and 
his eyes were mad with fear, anger and hate.

741
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:28,760
Yvette felt very cold and lonely.

742
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,400
There was a terrible silence.

743
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:39,520
'Are you saying that I can't be a friend 
of the Eastwoods?' she asked again.

744
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,840
'You can be their friend, if 
you wish,' said the rector.

745
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:49,880
'But if you are, you cannot be with your 
Granny, your Aunt Cissie, and Lucille.

746
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,000
You have to choose between 
clean people like your Granny,  

747
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,200
and people who are unclean 
in their bodies and minds.'

748
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,560
There was another silence.

749
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,680
'All right,' said Yvette at last.

750
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,080
'I'll write to the Eastwoods.

751
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,920
I'll say that you don't want me to know them.'

752
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:21,360
She walked quietly out of the room 
and wrote a note to Mrs Eastwood.

753
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,800
Dear Mrs Eastwood,

754
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,840
Daddy isn't happy that I'm visiting you.

755
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:31,960
So you'll understand that I 
can no longer come to Scoresby.

756
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,120
I'm very sorry.

757
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,960
After she had sent the note, Yvette felt empty.

758
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,920
Her life was dull.

759
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,320
Her home was cold and loveless.

760
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,080
She thought about the gipsy again.

761
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:52,880
She wanted him to hold her in his arms 
and keep her safe from her father.

762
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,880
Her feelings for her father had changed.

763
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,760
She still liked him, but she no longer loved him.

764
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,560
His words had hurt her very much.

765
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,120
And she began to hate Granny.

766
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:15,120
Whenever she saw the fat, blind old woman sitting 
in the drawing room, she thought of a great toad.

767
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,520
After she had sent the note, 
Yvette saw the gipsy twice.

768
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,680
Once he came to the house with things to sell.

769
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,440
She stood by the window on 
the stairs and watched him.

770
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,600
But she did not go downstairs and talk to him.

771
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:35,600
The second time that Yvette saw 
the gipsy, she met him by accident.

772
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,320
It was March, and the weather was sunny.

773
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:44,880
Brightly coloured spring flowers were growing 
in the woods and on the hills and fields.

774
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,400
Yvette was cycling along the road.

775
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,800
She saw the gipsy coming out of a stone cottage.

776
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,880
His horse and the green cart 
were standing in the road.

777
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,080
He returned to the cart with some of his brushes.

778
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,800
Yvette got off her bicycle.

779
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,160
As soon as she saw him, she loved him.

780
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,400
She knew that she loved the way that he moved.

781
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,120
She loved his face as he 
turned, silently, towards her.

782
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,280
She felt that she knew him 
better than she knew anybody.

783
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,720
She knew him better than her sister, Lucille.

784
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,240
She felt that she belonged to the gipsy forever.

785
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:33,640
'Have you made anything new?' she asked, 
looking at the things on his cart.

786
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,360
'I don't think so,' he said.

787
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:42,320
When the gipsy looked at her, 
there was still desire in his eyes.

788
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:46,160
But now the desire was less strong.

789
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:51,320
'The old gipsy dreamed 
something about you,' he said.

790
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,800
'Did she?' cried Yvette, very interested.

791
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,240
'What did she tell you?'

792
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,560
'She said, "Be braver in your body,  

793
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:09,240
or your luck will leave you." And then she 
said, "Listen for the voice of water."'

794
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,600
'What does that mean?' asked Yvette in surprise.

795
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,480
'I asked her that question,' the gipsy said.

796
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,920
'She says that she doesn't know.'

797
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,720
Then he was silent, as he looked at her soft face.

798
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,120
'All right,' she said.

799
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:34,160
'I don't understand the words now, but 
perhaps I'll understand them in the future.'

800
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,880
She looked at him with clear, shining eyes.

801
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,400
'Aren't you coming to the quarry again?' he said.

802
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,200
'Perhaps I'll come, sometime,' she said.

803
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:51,840
'It's spring!' he said, smiling 
and looking round at the sun.

804
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,200
'We're going to pack up our 
camp soon, and go away.'

805
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,680
'All right,' Yvette said.

806
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,640
'Perhaps I will visit before you go.

807
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:07,920
I'll come and say goodbye to your wife, 
and the old woman who sent me the message.'

808
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,760
But Yvette did not visit the 
gipsies camp at the quarry.

809
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:17,080
She went out with her friends to parties, 
and she danced with Leo Wetherell.

810
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:21,120
She wanted to go and say goodbye to the gipsies.

811
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,160
But she did not.

812
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,280
It was Friday afternoon.

813
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:32,920
The weather was fine, and the sun shone brightly 
on the yellow flowers in the rectory garden.

814
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,360
The River Papple was very full of water.

815
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:41,320
The water rushed quickly and 
noisily under the stone bridge.

816
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:46,000
It was unusual for the river 
to have so much water in it.

817
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,680
Yvette felt very lazy.

818
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,640
She did not want to do anything.

819
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,800
She walked in the garden by the river.

820
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,080
The rector had gone out, and Lucille was at work.

821
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,760
Granny was inside the house with Aunt Cissie.

822
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,360
Yvette sat on a wooden seat, which 
was only a few feet above the river.

823
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,520
She thought about the gipsies.

824
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:19,760
'The gipsies camp is a better home for me, 
than here in the rectory,' she thought.

825
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,200
Yvette looked again at the river.

826
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,040
The brown water was rushing past 
the garden extremely quickly.

827
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:35,680
She remembered the message from the old 
gipsy: 'Listen for the voice of water.'

828
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,640
Yvette heard a voice calling her name.

829
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,640
Aunt Cissie was standing by a door 
of the house, waving her hand.

830
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:48,040
'Yvette! I'm going to the 
village!' Cissie shouted.

831
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,080
'I won't be away for long.

832
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,320
Don't forget that Granny is alone.'

833
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,040
'All right!' Yvette shouted back.

834
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,120
The sun was beginning to go down.

835
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:03,273
It was past five o'clock.

836
01:00:03,273 --> 01:00:06,720
Yvette would have to go 
back into the rectory soon.

837
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:12,240
Once again, she would have to be in 
those horrible rooms with Granny.

838
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,280
She walked by the river.

839
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:18,840
She did not want to go inside the ugly house.

840
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,440
Suddenly she heard the sharp noise 
of a horse and cart on the road.

841
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,040
And somebody was shouting.

842
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,040
It was the gipsy.

843
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:32,880
He was waving his hands at 
her wildly, and shouting.

844
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,240
Yvette turned and looked behind her.

845
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:42,800
At that moment, she heard a sound like 
the roar of a great and dangerous animal.

846
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:49,720
A huge wall of water was coming around the 
bend of the river and rushing down towards her.

847
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,480
The gipsy was shouting and 
running across the garden.

848
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:58,320
He pulled her arm and screamed, 'Run!'

849
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,720
The huge wave of water swept Yvette off her feet.

850
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,000
The gipsy pulled her towards the house.

851
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,600
He was trying to take her to the 
steps that led up to the front door.

852
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:16,240
But before they reached the steps, another 
wave hit them and covered their heads.

853
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,080
The water was as cold as ice.

854
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,240
The gipsy pulled Yvette up again.

855
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:28,280
'Go to the steps!' he shouted in Yvette's 
ear, pushing her in front of him.

856
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,120
At last, they reached the steps of the house.

857
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:37,840
Another wall of water came roaring 
to the house, and the walls shook.

858
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:43,080
The gipsy pushed open the door 
and they were swept inside.

859
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,680
The water filled the hall.

860
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,680
Suddenly they saw Granny 
come out of the drawing room.

861
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:55,840
She felt the water all around her legs, 
and opened her mouth in a cry of fear.

862
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,000
Yvette climbed up the stairs.

863
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,040
Water poured from her hair and clothes.

864
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:07,040
The gipsy followed her, his 
wet black hair over his eyes.

865
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:13,520
From the top of the stairs, they stared at the 
flood, which rushed through the hall below them.

866
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,040
Yvette saw Granny's body in the water.

867
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:22,000
Her old face was purple and 
her mouth opened and closed.

868
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,840
But no sound came out.

869
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,560
She was trying to hold onto 
the stairs with one hand.

870
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:33,240
Yvette saw the old woman's gold 
wedding ring shining on her finger.

871
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:38,760
Another wave of water struck the house 
and there was a strange cracking noise.

872
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,360
Yvette reached the door of her bedroom.

873
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,360
The water moved below them like a wild brown sea.

874
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,720
They felt the house begin to move.

875
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,120
'The house is going to fall!' shouted the gipsy.

876
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,320
'Where is the chimney? The chimney is strong.

877
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,800
It won't fall.

878
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,960
We must get near the chimney.

879
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,120
Then we'll be safe.'

880
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:05,160
'Come in here! In here!' said Yvette.

881
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,600
The chimney was in one wall of Yvette's bedroom.

882
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:12,800
They went into the room and the 
gipsy looked out of the window.

883
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:17,760
Outside, between the house and the 
hill, there was a sea of water.

884
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:24,480
Broken trees and other things were being 
swept around in the wild brown flood.

885
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,680
There was a terrible noise 
from somewhere in the house.

886
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,920
Walls were falling.

887
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,640
'It's all right,' said the gipsy.

888
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,600
'This room is safe.'

889
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,600
He pointed to the chimney.

890
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,200
'Look, the chimney is strong.

891
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,800
It's like a tower.

892
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,920
But we must get warm.

893
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,120
Take off your wet clothes and get into the bed.

894
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,440
I'll rub you with a towel so that you can get dry.

895
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,480
I'll dry myself too.'

896
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,320
The gipsy pulled off his wet clothes.

897
01:03:55,320 --> 01:04:00,680
He took a towel and began to 
rub his cold wet body quickly.

898
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,960
Yvette took off her dress.

899
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,080
Her body was shaking.

900
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:09,400
The gipsy went to the door and looked out.

901
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,040
The sky was quite dark now.

902
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:15,800
The end of the house that was 
nearest to the river had gone.

903
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,920
The water had swept the walls away.

904
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,600
The stairs had disappeared too.

905
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:29,040
'It's all right! The water isn't 
rising any higher,' said the gipsy.

906
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,560
'Get into the bed.

907
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,720
Lie under the blankets.'

908
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,920
Yvette pulled the sheets 
and blankets over her head.

909
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,480
Her body was shaking with cold.

910
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:43,680
Suddenly she uncovered her 
head and looked at the gipsy.

911
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,320
'M-make me warm!' she cried.

912
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,720
Her teeth were snapping 
together between each word.

913
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,440
'I w-will d-die from the c-cold.'

914
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,520
The gipsy nodded his head 
and held her in his arms.

915
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,000
His body was shaking too.

916
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,280
He held her body tightly against his own body.

917
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:07,600
Slowly, they began to feel warm again.

918
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,960
At last, they slept.

919
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:16,440
The next day, the sun was 
shining in a beautiful blue sky.

920
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,920
The bridge had broken and disappeared.

921
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,720
But the water had stopped rising.

922
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,040
Most of the rectory had 
been destroyed in the flood.

923
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:31,600
The south-west corner of the house was 
now a great pile of mud and stones.

924
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:36,920
By midday, men from Papplewick 
village arrived at the rectory.

925
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:41,200
They used ladders to get 
across the river to the house.

926
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:47,760
In the kitchen, they found Granny's body 
among the mud, trees and broken furniture.

927
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,360
Then more villagers came running down the hill.

928
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,480
They had a message from the old gipsy.

929
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,240
He had said that his son had 
been near the rector's house.

930
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,040
He had seen Yvette at the top of the house.

931
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,040
Everyone began to search for Yvette.

932
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:09,000
The men put a long ladder up 
to the window of her bedroom.

933
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,880
A policeman from Papplewick climbed up the 
ladder and broke the glass of the window.

934
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,720
He saw Yvette lying in the bed, asleep.

935
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,600
The noise of the breaking glass woke her.

936
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,560
She sat up suddenly, holding a blanket around her.

937
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:31,840
The policeman shouted to the people 
below, 'Miss Yvette's in bed!'

938
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,240
'Don't be frightened, miss,' he said to Yvette.

939
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,000
'Don't worry anymore.

940
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,680
You're safe now.'

941
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,520
Yvette did not understand.

942
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,960
Was the policeman talking about the gipsy?

943
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,960
Where was her gipsy?

944
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,920
What had happened to him?

945
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,480
He had gone!

946
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,080
And a policeman was looking into the room!

947
01:06:55,080 --> 01:07:01,080
'If you get dressed, miss, we'll take you 
down to safe ground,' said the policeman.

948
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,920
'You can't stay here.

949
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,920
The house will probably fall.'

950
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,720
The policeman turned his head away and waited.

951
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,560
Yvette took some clothes from 
a cupboard and put them on.

952
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:17,160
The gipsy's wet clothes 
were no longer on the floor.

953
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,520
There was just a wet mark on the carpet.

954
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,280
Yvette called to the policeman.

955
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,880
'We must get out of the house as 
soon as possible, miss,' he said.

956
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,320
'The house may fall.'

957
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,720
'Really!' said Yvette calmly.

958
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,240
'Is it as bad as that?'

959
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,760
She heard shouts from outside.

960
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,680
She went to the window and looked out.

961
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,360
There, below, was her father.

962
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:50,280
The rector's arms were wide open and 
tears were running down his face.

963
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,600
'I'm all right, Daddy,' Yvette said calmly.

964
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,880
And tears began to run down her own face.

965
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:02,160
'Don't cry, miss, don't cry!' said the policeman.

966
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:08,040
'The rector has lost his mother, but 
he's very thankful that you're alive.'

967
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,920
'Is Granny drowned?' asked Yvette.

968
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,360
'I'm afraid that she is dead, 
poor lady!' said the policeman.

969
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,200
'Can you go down the ladder, miss?'

970
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,440
Yvette looked at the ladder.

971
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,400
It did not look safe.

972
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:30,840
But then she remembered the words of 
the old gipsy: 'Be braver in the body.'

973
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:34,280
'Oh, yes!' she said.

974
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:39,000
At the bottom of the ladder, 
she ran into her father's arms.

975
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,040
Later, a car took Yvette and her 
father to the Framleys house.

976
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,240
Lucille and Aunt Cissie were waiting there.

977
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:51,120
Lucille cried when she saw 
that her sister was safe.

978
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,960
Even Aunt Cissie was happy that Yvette was safe.

979
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:02,320
'I can't cry about Granny, now that 
Yvette is alive!' Aunt Cissie said.

980
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:08,040
The flood had happened because of a great 
reservoir, live miles from the rectory.

981
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,080
The reservoir contained a huge amount of water.

982
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:16,440
But the wall of the reservoir had 
become weak and had suddenly burst.

983
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:23,400
The water had rushed through the broken wall, 
and down to the village, in a great flood.

984
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,640
Yvette did not tell anyone that 
the gipsy had been in her bedroom.

985
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:31,520
She only said that he had 
taken her inside the house.

986
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,480
She said that she had climbed up the stairs alone.

987
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,840
But Yvette knew that the gipsy had escaped.

988
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,720
The old gipsy had come to the 
village to get the horse and cart.

989
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,760
He had said that his son was safe.

990
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:50,840
'We should thank the gipsy who 
saved Yvette's life,' said Lucille.

991
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,560
The rector and his daughters went to the quarry.

992
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,440
But it was empty.

993
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:00,080
The gipsies had packed up their camp and left.

994
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:05,880
That night, Yvette lay in her bed and 
thought about everything that had happened.

995
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,800
There was a deep pain in her heart.

996
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:17,840
'Oh, I love him! I love him! I 
love him!' she said to herself.

997
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,840
Sometime later, Yvette received a short letter.

998
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,560
Dear Miss,

999
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,320
I saw in the paper that you were all right.

1000
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,960
So was I.

1001
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:32,560
I hope that I'll see you again one day.

1002
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:38,680
I came that day to say goodbye, 
but the water gave me no time.

1003
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,400
Your servant,

1004
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,000
Joe Boswell

1005
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:51,360
For the first time, Yvette 
realized that the gipsy had a name.
