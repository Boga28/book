1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:04,960
Jake arrives at Euston station in London.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,590
It is a holiday weekend and it is his first
time away from Manchester.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,790
Jake is eighteen years old and he lives with
his family.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,290
Now he is in London.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,750
He is very happy.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,900
He stops and looks at his map.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,310
'I can go to the Notting Hill Carnival and
I can see some interesting places from the

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,560
bus too,' he thinks.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,650
Jake is sitting on a red London bus behind
a big family.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,569
The children are standing at the windows.

11
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:33,890
They are looking for famous places.

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,890
'Look!

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,330
There's Madame Tussaud's!

14
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,460
Can we go there?'

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,770
'Not today,' their mother answers.

16
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,840
'We're going to the carnival.'

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,410
'They're going to Notting Hill too,' Jake
thinks.

18
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,930
It is a hot afternoon and Jake is sitting
on a bench in Notting Hill.

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,740
Suddenly, he sees some people in costumes.

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,480
They have balloons and drams in their hands.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,540
'Does the carnival start here?'

22
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,140
Jake asks Mel, a girl in a green dress.

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,030
'Yes, near here.

24
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,030
Look at the floats!'

25
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,030
she says.

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,180
'Listen to the music!

27
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,350
The procession is starting.'

28
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,400
Suddenly, a tall girl runs to the first float.

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,710
Her costume is yellow and red and she has
feathers in her hair.

30
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,620
The young men on the float shout to her.

31
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,740
'Quickly, Maria!

32
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,860
You're late!'

33
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,640
'Sorry - a little problem with my job,' she
says.

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,060
'But it's OK now.'

35
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,920
The band moves slowly down the street.

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,640
Jake looks at the beautiful tall girl in her
carnival costume.

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,270
Their eyes meet and she smiles at him.

38
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,890
Suddenly, he knows.

39
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,970
It's love!

40
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,190
Jake's new friends are standing and waiting
for him.

41
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,590
But he walks away from them.

42
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,890
He can only see Maria.

43
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,770
Mel talks to Jake but he doesn't hear her.

44
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,330
She looks at Maria and she understands.

45
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,350
The carnival procession moves down the street.

46
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,340
On the floats people are dancing to the music.

47
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,150
Some people in the street are dancing too.

48
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,560
There is a lot of music, noise and colour.

49
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,630
Lake is running but there are crowds of people
near him.

50
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,310
He can't stay with Maria's float.

51
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,380
How can he meet this beautiful girl?

52
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,950
Who is she?

53
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,280
Maria looks down and sees Jake again.

54
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,730
He has a friendly face and she likes him too.

55
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,730
'I'm Jake.

56
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,200
What's your name?' he shouts.

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
'Hi, Jake!

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
I'm Maria,' she answers.

59
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,270
'Can I telephone you?

60
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,940
What's your number?"

61
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,060
She gives a big smile.

62
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,709
But Jake ain't hear her!

63
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,290
The band is playing and people are shouting.

64
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,580
The procession goes near a street cafe.

65
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,569
People are drinking coffee at tables on the
street.

66
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,210
A tourist is standing on a chair.

67
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,290
He is making a film of the carnival.

68
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,680
His wife is watching him.

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,880
Jake sees a camera on the table.

70
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,870
He wants a photograph of Maria.

71
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,440
He takes the camera and runs quickly after
the float.

72
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
'Maria!

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
Maria!

74
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
I want a photo!

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Smile, please!'

76
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,300
The procession is moving slowly.

77
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,880
There are crowds of people in the street and
Jake can't see Maria now.

78
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,160
'I can run down a quiet street and find her
float,' he thinks.

79
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,550
He tries the first street.

80
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,430
Suddenly, he hears the music from the band.

81
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,690
He is near the procession now.

82
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,989
He sees Maria's float and shouts, 'Maria!

83
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:09,989
I'm here!'

84
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,550
She sees him and she waves.

85
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,129
The tourist finds a policeman.

86
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,680
'A young man in a red T-shirt - he has my
camera!' he says.

87
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,900
'Yes, I understand.

88
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,209
Can you see him now?'

89
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,740
'It's very difficult in this crowd.

90
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,940
But wait... yes, I can see him!

91
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,360
There he is!'

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,140
Jake is standing on a bench.

93
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,250
'Look!

94
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,550
That's him and that's my camera!'

95
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,840
Jake puts his photograph of Maria in his pocket.

96
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
He is happy now.

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,260
The policeman and the tourist run to him.

98
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,190
'Come down, young man,' the policeman says.

99
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,870
'Is that your camera?'

100
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,180
'No, it's my camera,' the man says.

101
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,800
Jake's face is red.

102
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,190
Now he has a problem.

103
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,760
'Sorry, I only want one photo.

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,099
Here's your camera.'

105
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,269
'I'm very sorry,' Jake says.

106
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,519
'I never do this.'

107
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,370
Jake thinks of his mother and he is very unhappy.

108
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,800
The tourists think of their son and suddenly
they are unhappy too.

109
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,060
'We have our camera now,' they say.

110
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,580
'He isn't a bad boy.

111
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,160
Please, can he go?'

112
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,340
'No, I can't do that,' the policeman says.

113
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,330
Jake is standing in front of a police sergeant.

114
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:18,870
'Now, in your pockets you have... a map, a
pen, 5.73 pounds a train ticket.

115
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,320
Is that all?'

116
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,180
'Let's see this important photo,' the first
policeman says.

117
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,931
Jake takes the photo from his back pocket
and gives it to the sergeant.

118
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:29,940
The sergeant looks at the photograph for a
long time.

119
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,470
He is surprised.

120
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,620
'Where's Policewoman Day?'

121
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,520
the sergeant asks.

122
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,660
'She's at the doctor's,' a policewoman says.

123
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,600
'No, she's here again now,' a policeman says.

124
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,880
'Do you want her?'

125
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
'Yes.

126
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
Send her in.

127
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
We have a problem.'

128
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,860
The policeman walks to the door and says,
'Please come in, Policewoman Day.'

129
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,400
The policemen look at the photo and they smile.

130
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Why?

131
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Jake doesn't understand.

132
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,250
The door opens and Policewoman Day comes in.

133
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,690
She looks at Jake.

134
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,750
He looks at her.

135
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,870
They are very surprised.

136
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,870
'It's you!'

137
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,870
they say at the same time.

138
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,010
'Look at this photo, Maria,' the sergeant
says.

139
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,710
'Here you are at the doctor's - or perhaps
the carnival?'

140
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,080
- THE END -
