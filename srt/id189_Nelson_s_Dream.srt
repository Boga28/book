CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,700
Endings

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:11,219
That Friday evening, at Heathrow Airport,
Nelson Mbizi turned to wave a last goodbye

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,790
to his student friends.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:18,010
They were jumping up and down, making crazy
faces and shouting his name.

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:24,680
They'd given him a huge soft toy, a bear with
the name Paddington written across its blue

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,100
jacket.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,030
He felt stupid carrying it, but didn't know
what else to do with it.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,030
'Bye!

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:36,250
Thanks for the bear!' he called, lifting the
bear up and waving it as he walked through

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,390
to security.

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,760
It was sad saying goodbye, but he was glad
he'd got his degree and was leaving the greyness

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,239
of London to go back to sunny Gomokure, his
home country.

14
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,220
He stood in the security queue and thought
about the people he'd met during his hotel

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,329
management studies.

16
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:59,760
He was going to miss some of them badly, especially
Jackie.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,579
There were those who had laughed at him when
he told them he wanted to go home to Africa

18
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:06,710
and 'make things better'.

19
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:12,539
But Jackie had said, 'Even if you don't know
how yet, I'm sure you'll make a big difference

20
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,280
someday.'

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,069
Nelson and Jackie had been lovers for a year,
but when they both realised they wanted to

22
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:24,829
go home to their own countries, they'd agreed
their affair was over.

23
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:27,439
She'd left for Australia two days before.

24
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,399
The sadness of missing her was like a gentle
ache in Nelson's chest.

25
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:39,049
Once through security, he bought a cappuccino
and sat watching the planes come and go, and

26
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:40,369
the sun go down.

27
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:46,969
He thought of his lovely but difficult mother,
and his big, airy bedroom.

28
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:52,220
He thought of his father, who had ridiculed
him so often, but still wanted him to work

29
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,630
in one of the hotels he owned - a man who
never asked people to do things, but just

30
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,750
ordered them around.

31
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,369
He wasn't going to be the easiest of bosses.

32
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:07,570
'Still,' thought Nelson, 'it'll be good to
be earning my own money.'

33
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,270
The loudspeakers announced Nelson's flight.

34
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:17,960
'Flight 087 to Kurupenda is now boarding at
Gate 53.'

35
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
***

36
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,159
Kurupenda, the capital city of Gomokure, has
many suburbs.

37
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,180
Some are luxurious with large houses and gardens.

38
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:34,040
Some, like Chapangana, have narrow, dusty
streets and tiny houses.

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:41,120
On the same Friday evening, in a small house
in Sector D, a crowded area of Chapangana,

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,390
a sixteen-year-old boy sat beside his mother.

41
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,379
She was quiet today.

42
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:51,560
She lay on the earth floor, wrapped in a blanket
with another on top.

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,660
Once, her skin had been clear and dark like
chocolate, but now that she was sick, large

44
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,590
parts of her face and arms were white and
dry.

45
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,319
She was shivering with cold.

46
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,980
Her lips were cracked and bleeding, and she
was so thin that her bones showed through

47
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,580
both blankets.

48
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,920
Daniel and his brothers and sister had watched
their mother slowly dying for months.

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,909
She opened her eyes.

50
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,280
'Daniel,' she said.

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,620
'Go and see if Philomena's coming.'

52
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,609
Her voice was weak, but her eyes burned in
her bony face.

53
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:34,720
'OK,' he said and smiled at her.

54
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,870
'Don't waste time!'

55
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,200
Her voice was deeper than he had ever heard
it.

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,150
'And ask your sister to come here.'

57
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,519
'OK,' he said again and turned away.

58
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,390
Daniel went through the front room where his
eldest brother, Eddy, was pretending to be

59
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,010
asleep on the bare floor.

60
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,930
He went on out into the tiny yard.

61
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:01,489
His sister, Lily Anne, was playing with their
baby brother, Blessing, in the dust.

62
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,620
She had on her bright pink shoes.

63
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,989
'Mum wants you,' he said.

64
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,129
Lily Anne went in.

65
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:12,249
She knew what to do.

66
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:16,639
All four of the children had been living with
this illness for a long time.

67
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,350
Their father had died the year before.

68
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:26,630
Daniel stood in the tiny garden of number
1175, Sector D, looking up the long, straight

69
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,650
street.

70
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,500
He prayed that Philomena would come quickly.

71
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,340
She was the only friend his mother seemed
to trust.

72
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,920
He could see people moving, black against
the setting sun: groups of teenagers laughing

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:47,140
and chatting, smaller children playing and
running about, adults coming home from work,

74
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,770
tired but cheerful because it was Friday.

75
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:58,350
Music came from the small, boxy houses - radio
music, guitar music, traditional songs.

76
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,560
Only number 1175 was silent.

77
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,871
Then, among the dark bodies in the shining
fog of dust, he saw Philomena, tall, thin

78
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:13,010
and graceful, carrying a large bag on her
head.

79
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,560
She went into her house, number 1163.

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,389
Daniel ran to her gate.

81
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,670
He called, 'Knock, knock.'

82
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,380
'Come in,' she said as she came to the door.

83
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,850
'Ah, it's you, Daniel.

84
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,700
What is it?'

85
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,803
'Mum is sorry to interrupt your evening, but
she needs to speak to you.

86
00:05:34,803 --> 00:05:37,530
Can you come now?'

87
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:43,960
Philomena went inside, picked up her keys,
closed the door, and followed Daniel without

88
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,540
a word.

89
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,620
At number 1175, Daniel took Philomena into
the back room.

90
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,690
He saw her stop for a second, as usual, to
adjust to the smell.

91
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:01,480
Then she smiled her wide smile, sat on the
floor by his mother, and picked up a thin,

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,080
dry hand.

93
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,980
'Melanie,' she said, 'I've come.'

94
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:12,400
Melanie was too weak to lift her head, but
she opened her eyes and tried to smile at

95
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,250
her friend.

96
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,630
She took a deep breath.

97
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,940
'My time has come,' she said.

98
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,240
'I have to ask you to do one more favour for
me.'

99
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,470
'Anything,' promised Philomena.

100
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:34,230
'I want you to ask your rich employer to help
my children...

101
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,950
There's nobody else I can turn to.'

102
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,070
'I'll do that,' replied Philomena.

103
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,690
'The older ones are not sick.'

104
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,710
Melanie spoke in short bursts.

105
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,050
'Eddy's seventeen and not interested in school...

106
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,780
so he's looking for a job.

107
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,270
But he won't be able to support the others...

108
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:04,000
Daniel is clever, so he'll need help to finish
school... and with his music.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,910
Lily Anne should do four more years of school,
and she's a good cook...

110
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,450
One day she'll be a good housekeeper.

111
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:19,220
There's been almost no money since their father
died, but she still feeds us all somehow.'

112
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:26,310
Daniel watched the tears running out of his
mother's eyes and into her strangely white

113
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,150
ears.

114
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,330
The drops then fell onto the clean white pillow,
making a wet mark.

115
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,950
Lily Anne stood nearby, waiting for a chance
to change the pillow.

116
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:43,780
Melanie could hardly breathe, but she went
on.

117
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,240
'But little Blessing will join me soon.

118
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,430
He is sick, like me.'

119
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,720
'Are you sure?' asked Philomena.

120
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,330
'He was born after their father got sick...

121
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,810
He was tested with me at the hospital at Christmas.'

122
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:07,170
'You didn't tell me the result,' said Philomena.

123
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,120
Melanie's hand jumped in Philomena's, and
she tightened her grip.

124
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,030
'You will do this for me?'

125
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,540
she begged, and coughed a terrible, bubbling
cough.

126
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,810
She took a deep breath and pain showed on
her face.

127
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,640
Her eyes burned into Philomena's.

128
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Philomena nodded.

129
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,030
'I promise,' she said.

130
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:36,680
'Ask Eddy and Blessing to come to me,' Melanie
said.

131
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,320
Philomena pulled open Melanie's fingers and
stood up.

132
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,370
She turned and ran through to the front door.

133
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,230
'Eddy, bring Blessing,' she called as she
ran.

134
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,510
'At once!'

135
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,560
Eddy was ready.

136
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,640
He came in, put Blessing down beside his mother
and kissed the top of her head.

137
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,150
She lifted her hand to touch Eddy's face.

138
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,750
He stepped back and got down on his knees
beside Daniel.

139
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,080
Lily Anne stood beside them.

140
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,590
'Come, Daniel,' his mother said.

141
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,890
Daniel bent over his mother to kiss her head.

142
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,630
She wiped a tear from his face with her hard,
dry hand.

143
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:26,870
'When I am free,' she whispered, 'I will always
be nearby.'

144
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:32,440
Daniel smiled as his tears fell on her blankets.

145
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,050
'I will always listen for your voice,' he
promised.

146
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,990
He went back to kneel by Eddy.

147
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,370
He knew someone should say something like
they did in church, but he couldn't think

148
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,370
what.

149
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:53,030
Lily Anne went to her mother, kissed her hand
and stepped back before she could speak.

150
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:58,050
Little Blessing sat on the earth floor, playing
with a leaf he'd picked up outside.

151
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:06,740
'God, take care of my children,' Melanie cried
out in a deep voice like a man's.

152
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,120
She gasped and coughed.

153
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,310
Her eyes opened wide and went dull.

154
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,870
She didn't breathe in again.

155
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,180
The children didn't move.

156
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,200
Philomena crawled forward on her knees.

157
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,460
Her tears blinding her, she lifted the hand
that was stretched out towards Blessing and

158
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,060
laid it on Melanie's chest.

159
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,460
She closed Melanie's staring, empty eyes,
and sat back.

160
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:39,310
Eddy jumped up, impatiently wiping his eyes
and his nose on the bottom of his T-shirt.

161
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,470
'Is she dead?' he asked Philomena.

162
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,470
'Yes.'

163
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,720
'So now what?' he shouted.

164
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
'Now what?

165
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,529
What the hell are we supposed to do now?!'

166
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:53,340
He turned and went into the other room.

167
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,960
'What the hell!?

168
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,570
What the hell!?'

169
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,330
His angry voice filled the little house.

170
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,800
Then he ran out into the street.

171
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,890
Lily Anne took Blessing in her arms and lifted
him up, her young face expressionless.

172
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:15,160
'I only have enough sadza for us to eat today
and tomorrow,' she said to Philomena.

173
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,050
'I've got some,' said Philomena, her eyes
on her dear friend's peaceful face.

174
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,520
'You'll eat with me tonight.'

175
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,960
Daniel got up from his knees and sat beside
his mother, touching her hair.

176
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:38,790
He whispered to her, 'We talked about it,
but we didn't really believe it...

177
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,230
You weren't supposed to really die.

178
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,830
Nobody will love us like you did.'

179
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:50,870
The last orange light of the sun shone through
the little window and gently touched his mother's

180
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,870
cheek.

181
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,930
Daniel heard Philomena go out to find someone
to help with the body.

182
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:02,990
The women in the street began the loud weeping
he had heard so often lately.

183
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,960
He stood up and walked outside in a dream.

184
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,810
Life would be very different from now on.

185
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,800
CHAPTER TWO

186
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Home again

187
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:25,250
Early on Saturday morning, Nelson stood waiting
for his suitcases at Kurupenda Airport.

188
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,440
In the three years since he'd left, a shiny
new airport had been built.

189
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,550
As he looked around, he saw his mother waving
from behind a glass wall.

190
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,029
He smiled and waved back.

191
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:44,360
She had on a long red and white dress and
a head cloth, and she was laughing.

192
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,430
'You look wonderful, Mum,' he said as they
met.

193
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,990
He hugged her and lifted her off her feet.

194
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,420
'You look too much like an adult!'

195
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,420
she replied.

196
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,820
'Put me down!

197
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,270
Where is my little boy?'

198
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,430
'Not there anymore, Mum.

199
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,060
I'm twenty-two now.

200
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,150
I've even got a real job, if Dad still wants
me to work for him.'

201
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,610
'Oh, he does.

202
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,830
He's been talking about it for weeks now.

203
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,440
Is this toy bear yours?'

204
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
'Yeah.

205
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,520
My friends gave him to me to "look after"
me!'

206
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,250
Ruby Mbizi laughed and took Nelson's arm.

207
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,470
'Now you're home you'll be well looked after!'

208
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,760
She led him out to a new Mercedes that shone
in the early-morning sun.

209
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,450
As Nelson and his mother drove towards their
house, Nelson looked out for things he remembered.

210
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:44,020
The jacaranda trees were flowering the same
misty September blue in the avenues.

211
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:50,500
Most of the buildings were the same, some
modern with a lot of glass, some older, and

212
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,380
some like buildings he'd seen in London.

213
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,710
At last they were driving up their own leafy
street.

214
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:03,850
The great white gate was still the same, but
it opened electronically now.

215
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,810
The man in the little gatehouse was new.

216
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:12,230
He touched his hat and called out, 'Good morning,
Mrs Mbizi, young Mr Mbizi!'

217
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,310
as Nelson's mother drove into their garden.

218
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,990
Nelson saw that the bushes round the tennis
court were taller and the house had been painted

219
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,860
a paler pink than he remembered.

220
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,160
But the great spreading flamboyant tree by
the swimming pool hadn't changed, the perfectly

221
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,730
cut grass was still as richly green, and the
flowerbeds were even more colourful.

222
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,670
'It's good to be home,' he said as they went
up the steps into the house.

223
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,380
'Are you hungry?'

224
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,550
his mother asked.

225
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,380
'You bet!'

226
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,050
'I'll ask Cook to make you some breakfast.

227
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,010
Come into my sitting room.

228
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,740
There's something I want to show you.'

229
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,870
Ruby Mbizi sat down at her desk and pulled
a large photograph towards her.

230
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:03,230
'Your second cousins,' she said with a smile.

231
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,050
Three lovely young women were sitting on the
deck of a luxurious river boat.

232
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,779
They all wore bikinis and had the same empty
smile on their perfect faces.

233
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,560
'Look, Mum...'

234
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,220
Nelson was embarrassed by what he knew was
coming.

235
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,779
He walked over to the window.

236
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:23,779
Ruby smiled.

237
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:28,399
'You'll need some company, and they're all
in town just now.

238
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,080
You have a choice of three!'

239
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,980
'Let's leave it a week or two, shall we, Mum?'

240
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,560
There was a knock on the door and Mrs Mbizi
called out, 'What is it?'

241
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,820
Philomena, the housekeeper, came in.

242
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,970
'Excuse me, madam, but can I ask you something?'

243
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,149
Nelson turned from the window to look at Philomena.

244
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:55,750
'Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Nelson.'

245
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,670
Philomena's smile was like a light in the
dark by the door.

246
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,870
'Welcome back.

247
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,080
I didn't know you were here.'

248
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,020
'Thank you, Philomena,' Nelson said.

249
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,950
'Good to see you.'

250
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,860
'I'll come back later, madam.'

251
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,190
Philomena turned to go.

252
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,510
'Was it something private?' asked Ruby Mbizi.

253
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,930
'Not really, madam.

254
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,709
But it's important.

255
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:26,390
I wanted to ask you for help for some children.

256
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:32,050
They've just lost their mother and their father
and they're orphans now.'

257
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,830
Nelson saw his mother's face harden.

258
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:40,960
'Well, Philomena, if I helped every child
in that situation I would have nothing left

259
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,620
within a week, isn't that so?'

260
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,470
Mrs Mbizi said with a false little smile.

261
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,920
'That's true, madam.'

262
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,980
Philomena looked down at her shoes.

263
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,240
Nelson turned back to the window.

264
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,630
'It was the mother's dying wish that I asked
you,' she said.

265
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,890
'Well, now you have.

266
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,909
Is there anything else?'

267
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:06,419
'No, madam.'

268
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,439
'That's all then, Philomena.

269
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,949
Thank you.'

270
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:16,220
Nelson waited until the door had closed and
then asked his mother, 'Couldn't you give

271
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,569
something to the church and ask them to help
that family?

272
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:24,000
Then you needn't say the money's from you
and you won't have others begging...'

273
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,679
'Nelson, my dearest, there are now thousands
and thousands of AIDS orphans in this country.

274
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,499
There's nothing anyone can do about it.'

275
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,149
'There must be, Mum.

276
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:37,279
There must be organisations...'

277
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,529
'Well, I'm not an organisation.'

278
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:43,330
'Perhaps Philomena just doesn't know who to
ask.'

279
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,520
'Well, nor do I.

280
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,789
So there's an end to it.'

281
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:49,110
Nelson was tired.

282
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:54,179
He hadn't slept much on the plane and he knew
he would never persuade his mother to think

283
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,399
about something when she didn't want to.

284
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:58,519
'How's Dad?' he asked.

285
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,379
'Busier than ever.

286
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,090
I hardly ever see him.'

287
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,779
Ruby smiled a twisted smile and her eyes warned
him off the subject.

288
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:11,820
'I'll go and have some breakfast by the pool,'
he said.

289
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:19,409
Nelson bent to kiss her and went to the kitchen,
leaving Ruby looking at the photograph.

290
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:24,690
The smell of Cook's biscuits and the warmth
from the oven met him in the corridor.

291
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,269
He stopped just before the kitchen as he heard
Philomena say his name.

292
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:32,100
'You didn't tell me Mr Nelson was back,' she
was saying.

293
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,100
'No.

294
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,470
I thought you'd get a nice surprise,' said
Cook.

295
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,080
'What do you mean by that?'

296
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,690
'Well, he's always been your favourite.'

297
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,559
'He's everybody's favourite, not just mine.

298
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,200
He's much too nice to have Mr and Mrs Mbizi
as parents.'

299
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,980
Cook and Philomena laughed.

300
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,260
This seemed to be an old joke.

301
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,379
Nelson coughed to warn them he was coming.

302
00:18:56,379 --> 00:19:01,960
Cook said loudly, 'Is Mr Nelson's orange juice
ready?'

303
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,840
'Hello, Cook,' said Nelson as he came into
the kitchen.

304
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,640
'I do believe you've got a bit fatter!'

305
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,409
Cook laughed with delight and clapped her
hands.

306
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:18,210
'You sound very English now, Mr Nelson,' said
Cook.

307
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,659
Nelson smiled.

308
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,730
'Philomena, can you bring my breakfast out
to the pool?' he asked.

309
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,740
'Of course,' she said.

310
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,429
Nelson was almost asleep in the early sun
when she arrived with a heavy tray.

311
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:38,739
She put the tray down on a small table beside
Nelson and turned to go.

312
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:39,739
'Philomena.'

313
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:43,590
Nelson sat up and looked at the glass of orange
juice.

314
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,029
'What's the name of the family of orphans?'

315
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:49,340
'The mother was Melanie Mawadza.

316
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,139
There are four children.'

317
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:55,119
'What's their address?'

318
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,489
He focused on his plate.

319
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:01,870
'Number 1175, Sector D.'

320
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,509
'Mmm.

321
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:05,659
Do you live near there?'

322
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:07,009
'Yes.

323
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:08,150
Five houses further up.'

324
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,289
'Do they have any money at all?'

325
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:17,859
Nelson was still looking down, careful not
to look into Philomena's eyes, remembering

326
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:19,799
his African manners.

327
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:25,109
'I think they own their house and they may
be OK for a short while.

328
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:28,159
But nobody is earning just now.'

329
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,379
'OK, Philomena.

330
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:31,489
Thanks.'

331
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:33,260
He looked up at last.

332
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,409
'Thank you, Mr Nelson.'

333
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:38,039
Philomena turned and left.

334
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:42,960
'Why did I ask her about those children?'
he thought as he ate.

335
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,909
'I can't do anything to help.

336
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,909
I've got no money.'

337
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:53,070
His parents had always talked of life in the
Sectors as ugly and dangerous and had forbidden

338
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,480
him to go there.

339
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,940
'Forget it,' he thought.

340
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:04,399
'Better not to get involved.'

341
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:05,399
CHAPTER THREE

342
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:08,269
Sector D

343
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:12,429
Nelson didn't see his father that first evening.

344
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:18,669
Mr Mbizi was the government Minister for International
Trade as well as a hotelier, and he was giving

345
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:20,379
a speech in Parliament.

346
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:26,340
Next morning, breakfast was laid out as usual
under the tree beside the glass doors from

347
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,890
the dining room.

348
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,840
Nelson sighed happily and sat down.

349
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,890
It was good to be back.

350
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,499
There was no sign of his mother or his father.

351
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:39,490
But there was a note on the table.

352
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,070
Welcome home!

353
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,540
Sorry to miss you again.

354
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,909
I have to be at Parliament again today, so
I won't be able to call you.

355
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:50,510
Meet me at the hotel at 5 p.m.

356
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,960
I'll introduce you to everyone and you'll
start work with Fletcher, the accountant,

357
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
tomorrow.

358
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,730
You've got a lot to learn and I want you to
learn it fast.

359
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,730
Dad

360
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,730
'Yuck!'

361
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,730
thought Nelson.

362
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,600
'Accounts are not my thing.

363
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,389
Perhaps I can get out of that soon and into
guest services.'

364
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:15,759
He called a few friends as he ate, hoping
to find a partner to play tennis.

365
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,179
But it turned out that none of his old friends
was free.

366
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:21,570
They were either busy or out of the country.

367
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:27,710
As he ate the last piece of toast, he was
surprised to find himself thinking about Sector

368
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,450
D.

369
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,389
His parents would probably be furious if they
knew he was even interested, so he'd have

370
00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:35,659
to be careful.

371
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:39,960
And without money he wasn't sure there was
anything he could do to help.

372
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,529
'But I'd just like to see what it's like,'
he told himself.

373
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:49,429
He went up to his room and put some old clothes
into a backpack.

374
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:54,960
Then he borrowed the gardener's truck and
drove to a supermarket.

375
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,179
In the men's toilets he changed into the old
clothes and a woollen hat with a hole in.

376
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,110
Then he joined the queue for a bus.

377
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,879
Nobody looked at him and he found he was enjoying
being someone else.

378
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:13,059
In the tiny combi bus the passengers were
squeezed together.

379
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:17,730
The girl on Nelson's left was pressed against
him.

380
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,659
She was pretty and he thought of speaking
to her, but the driver had music on so loud

381
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:25,350
there was no point in trying.

382
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,559
Nelson fought his way out of the bus at the
Sector D stop.

383
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:34,879
He asked for directions and set off down the
long, dusty street.

384
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:40,710
Number 1175 was deserted, the door shut.

385
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,710
Nelson was surprised.

386
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:47,450
As it was Sunday, he had expected there to
be lots of people around, but in fact the

387
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,619
whole area was strangely empty.

388
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:56,080
Further down the street a great jacaranda
tree threw a cool shadow.

389
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,600
He walked towards it, enjoying the difference
between its blue and the blue of the sky.

390
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,249
There was a silent crowd of people in its
shade.

391
00:24:05,249 --> 00:24:10,110
He moved towards them quietly, keeping close
to a fence.

392
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:14,519
As he got nearer he could hear someone singing.

393
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,080
The music was from an mbira and the voice
was clear and sweet.

394
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:25,980
Over the heads of the crowd Nelson saw a young
man sitting on a rock under the tree.

395
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,100
He was playing the mbira and singing.

396
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,009
The people around him were moving silently
to the music.

397
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:34,649
Some of them were crying.

398
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:37,799
The young man sang:

399
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:41,110
So sit with us and drink a beer.

400
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,720
Sit with us and share a tear.

401
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,799
Nelson saw a man with a television camera
in the crowd.

402
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:53,820
The camera was pointed at the singer and sometimes
it turned slowly towards the listeners.

403
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,139
The young man went on:

404
00:24:58,139 --> 00:25:00,710
She's left us, but she's still here.

405
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,169
Gonna live!

406
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:03,539
Keep her dear.

407
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:04,919
Gonna sing!

408
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:05,970
Hold her near.

409
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,450
She's left us, but she's still here.

410
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:14,080
When he stopped, the crowd stood still for
a moment.

411
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,220
Then they all sighed.

412
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,850
Some clapped their hands and some just turned
away sadly and left.

413
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,299
Nelson stayed back and watched.

414
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:30,850
He saw a girl of eleven or twelve in an old
dress and bright pink shoes sitting beside

415
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,659
a baby.

416
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:36,039
She got up and started towards the singer.

417
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,259
But the cameraman said, 'Please, Lily Anne.

418
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:39,889
Stay and play with Blessing.

419
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:43,009
I want a shot of you both.'

420
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:49,080
Behind him, Nelson heard a woman's voice say,
'And then come and get some shots of their

421
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
house.

422
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,559
We'll go to the grave when the light's better.

423
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,119
It's too bright just now.'

424
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:58,570
The young man who'd been singing stood up.

425
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:03,460
He was tall, but much too thin, like a very
young tree.

426
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,190
He walked past Nelson to cross the road.

427
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:13,760
'And Daniel,' said the voice, 'you can sing
another song at the graveside.'

428
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,899
Daniel went up to a young woman who was standing
in the shadow of a tall fence.

429
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:23,529
His hands were tightly closed as he looked
down at her, but he spoke quietly.

430
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:26,210
'I can't sing at the grave.

431
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,549
I can only cry there.'

432
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:30,659
And he walked away.

433
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,869
The young woman had a notebook in her hand.

434
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:38,250
She seemed angry as she crossed something
out on the page.

435
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,250
'Phil!'

436
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,629
she shouted, still looking down at her notes.

437
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:45,850
The cameraman turned.

438
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,480
'Yeah?' he said.

439
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,700
Nelson could see that Phil didn't like his
colleague much.

440
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,450
She looked up and called out, 'Get those kids
over to the house and let's have some shots

441
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,509
by the front door.'

442
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:03,289
Then she turned her head a little and looked
in Nelson's direction.

443
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,940
He could see straight into her eyes.

444
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,090
They were green, and bright with anger.

445
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,139
They were the most beautiful eyes he had ever
seen.

446
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:15,919
His legs turned to water.

447
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,109
He stepped backwards, glad there was a fence
behind him.

448
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,109
He couldn't move.

449
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:26,399
It was as if she had pinned him to the fence.

450
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,499
But she looked straight through him and stepped
out of the shadow.

451
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:34,990
Nelson saw that her skin was the colour of
coffee with cream.

452
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:41,599
She walked fast across the road towards number
1175, stepping over a dirty plastic bag like

453
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,950
a dancer.

454
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,190
The thinning crowd followed Phil and the young
woman.

455
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,429
Nelson followed too, once his legs felt stronger.

456
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:55,480
'Keep back, there,' the young woman shouted.

457
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,519
People stepped back, raising white dust in
the road.

458
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,169
The sun was high now, and very hot.

459
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:08,679
'You, Lily Anne, show me where your mother
was when she died.'

460
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,159
The woman and the girl went into the house.

461
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,889
Daniel and some friends sat down by the door.

462
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:19,889
Nelson stayed out in the road, but next to
the garden fence.

463
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:23,230
A friend asked Daniel, 'Any news of Eddy?'

464
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,239
'Not yet.

465
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:26,269
He'll come back soon.

466
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:31,389
You know him - it takes a lot of beer and
girls to get over the bad times.'

467
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:36,230
'I saw him yesterday,' said an older man.

468
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:40,240
'He was at a bottle store in the city centre.

469
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,299
He had a girl on each side and a bottle in
his hand.'

470
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:47,559
They all laughed.

471
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,509
Daniel played quietly on his mbira while they
talked.

472
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:53,549
Phil stood impatiently in the sun.

473
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:55,760
'Hey, Viki,' he called.

474
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,090
'You ready for me in there?'

475
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:02,429
He'd taken a floodlight and battery out of
a black case.

476
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:05,659
Vila's angry voice called back.

477
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:06,659
'Yeah.

478
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:07,659
Yeah.

479
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:08,659
OK.

480
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,090
Come on in, and bring Daniel.'

481
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,860
Nelson waited against the fence.

482
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,679
Daniel took the heavy battery from Phil and
went in.

483
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,910
Some of the young men began telling each other
stories of Eddy's adventures when his father

484
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,910
died.

485
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,960
They laughed so much they had to sit down
in the dust.

486
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,820
Nelson had forgotten that most people in his
country laughed a lot, and sang, and played

487
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,729
music, however bad they were feeling.

488
00:29:35,729 --> 00:29:37,769
He found he was smiling too.

489
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:41,489
Then Viki and the children came out.

490
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:42,489
'Phil!'

491
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,669
she called.

492
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:46,049
Phil tripped in the doorway and bumped into
Viki.

493
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:49,190
'Keep your big feet away from me!'

494
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,789
she said crossly.

495
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,769
Nelson could not take his eyes off her.

496
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:57,779
He wanted to go up to her and say, 'It's OK.

497
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:00,009
Don't be angry.

498
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:01,269
Relax.'

499
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:05,720
Instead he bent over the fence and asked Phil,
'Where are you from?'

500
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,200
Phil was looking down, adjusting the camera.

501
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,980
'South Africa.

502
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,759
Network 10.

503
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:13,759
Jo'burg.'

504
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,759
'Right.'

505
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,169
Johannesburg was over a thousand kilometres
away.

506
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:22,440
So there wasn't much chance of his meeting
Viki again.

507
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,149
Nelson felt suddenly depressed.

508
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:27,850
He looked around at all the smiling young
faces.

509
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:33,889
Everyone was thin and bony, and he could smell
rubbish and worse in the street.

510
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:37,960
'How many of you will be dead soon?' he thought.

511
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,749
Viki was ready for Phil to film her talking.

512
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:44,840
'Right, let's get on with it,' she said.

513
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,139
Phil was arranging the floodlight on the ground.

514
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:50,099
'I need this light.

515
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,559
Sun's too high.

516
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,169
Can't see your face.'

517
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:55,529
'Oh, for God's sake,' said Viki.

518
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:58,299
'Just get yourself together, will you!'

519
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:05,059
Nelson opened his mouth to speak, but Daniel
laughed and said, 'Bike up a hill, that's

520
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:06,419
our Phil!'

521
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:09,130
Everyone but Viki laughed.

522
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,869
'Ready,' said Phil with a grin.

523
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:15,649
He switched the light on and turned it towards
her.

524
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:19,809
She stood with her head up and looked directly
at Phil's camera.

525
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:22,369
She spoke clearly and with feeling.

526
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:28,190
'This is the home of Daniel Mawadza and his
brothers and sister.

527
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:33,039
They are all under eighteen.

528
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,019
Their father died last year.

529
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:36,019
He was thirty-eight.

530
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,080
Their mother died two days ago, so they are
now orphans.

531
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,289
The illness that killed their parents was
AIDS.

532
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:44,299
They want me to tell you about it.

533
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:50,710
'If they'd known what was wrong earlier, maybe
their parents could have found treatment.

534
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,929
If people could accept that this illness must
not be hidden away, then they could talk about

535
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:58,100
it more easily.

536
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,509
Daniel and his family have nothing and no-one.

537
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:07,389
They are facing a long, slow death from being
poor, if not from being sick, like their parents.

538
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:11,259
'This is happening all over Africa.

539
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:14,950
Why are the governments of our countries doing
so little?

540
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,849
I'll tell you why.

541
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:18,479
Because they're frightened by this illness.

542
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:22,009
Because you can get this infection from sex.

543
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:28,860
There'd be no children without sex, and yet,
in African cultures, men and women don't talk

544
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,529
to each other about it.

545
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:37,679
But because our leaders feel fear and shame,
thousands of people die every week, thousands

546
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,630
of new graves appear, thousands of families
are left without income, thousands of children

547
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,850
are orphaned.

548
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:51,719
'We must make sure our governments, our churches
and our society as a whole stop thinking of

549
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,359
this illness as an illness of shame.

550
00:32:54,359 --> 00:33:00,429
We must make sure that everyone knows about
it and knows how to stop it.

551
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:05,480
We must make sure that there are fewer families
like Daniel's, not more.

552
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,200
'Daniel Mawadza doesn't want to talk on camera.

553
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,059
He says that when bad things happen he makes
them into music.

554
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,450
He plays mbira and sings.

555
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,729
Listen to him now...'

556
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:25,369
Viki's voice changed completely as she said
to Phil, 'Cut that in before the shots of

557
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:29,009
Daniel singing under the tree.'

558
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,299
'Right,' said Phil.

559
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:34,350
There was a moment of quiet when they finished.

560
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,739
Then all the young people began to clap.

561
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:39,830
Viki looked surprised.

562
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:44,320
'That's enough,' she said and picked up her
bag and papers.

563
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,230
'I'll see you at the grave about four thirty,
Daniel.

564
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,190
Bring Lily Anne and Blessing.

565
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,559
See you in the car, Phil.'

566
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,159
She walked fast up the street and turned a
corner.

567
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,000
Nelson nodded to Phil and then found himself
walking after Viki.

568
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,519
'Mistake!' he told himself.

569
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,039
'This is not what you came for.

570
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:09,859
Those kids are going to need help very soon
and you have nothing to offer.

571
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:16,270
And that girl's bad news - and she lives a
thousand kilometres away.

572
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,270
Forget her.'

573
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,200
Viki had disappeared.

574
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:26,690
'Good thing,' Nelson said to himself as he
waited for the bus at the top of the street.

575
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:32,899
He felt shocked and sickened by the way these
people lived, in spite of their cheerfulness.

576
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:34,289
And he felt helpless.

577
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:37,770
There was nothing he could do to help so many.

578
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:41,770
Nelson thought about his mother's point of
view.

579
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:47,119
Better to forget about Sector D and start
working at the hotel.

580
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:55,369
At least the hotels provided jobs for some
people.

581
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:56,970
CHAPTER FOUR

582
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:57,970
Beginnings

583
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:07,260
Nelson's taxi drew up at the steps of the
Lion Hills Hotel at four fifty-six that afternoon.

584
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,030
Nelson went in through the tall glass doors.

585
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:18,180
At the reception desk a middle-aged man looked
up and said, 'Can I help you, sir?'

586
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,210
'I have an appointment with Mr Washington
Mbizi at five o'clock,' said Nelson with a

587
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,690
polite smile.

588
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:28,029
'Ah, you must be Nelson Mbizi.'

589
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:29,290
The man grinned.

590
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,520
'And you must be Fletcher.'

591
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,160
'That's right.

592
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,400
I'm the accountant.

593
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,500
Mr Mbizi told me to wait for you.

594
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,970
Good to meet you at last.'

595
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,869
'Pleased to meet you, Fletcher.'

596
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:46,430
They shook hands.

597
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,880
'It's good to be here.'

598
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,250
Nelson looked around.

599
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:57,039
'Your father,' said Fletcher, 'wants us to
go straight down to the accounts department

600
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,210
and he'll join us there.'

601
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,330
They went down to the basement in the lift.

602
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,950
Nelson's father met them there.

603
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:11,470
He looked older and fatter than Nelson remembered,
but he seemed genuinely pleased to see his

604
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,130
son at last.

605
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:19,740
He took Nelson round and introduced him to
what seemed like a hundred people.

606
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:24,839
He showed Nelson some of the hotel rooms,
the kitchens, the laundry, the stores and

607
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,380
the front office.

608
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:32,140
Later, Nelson and Fletcher sat in the little
grey accounts office and Fletcher explained

609
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,670
how the flow of money was controlled and recorded.

610
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:41,640
Nelson wasn't very interested, although he
surprised himself by how well he understood.

611
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,109
By ten o'clock he was yawning and he went
home exhausted, wondering whether managing

612
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:52,430
hotels would be all accounts and no people.

613
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:58,140
Later that night, in his dreams, Nelson watched
Viki from a hilltop.

614
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,089
She was by a river, picking flowers.

615
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:07,800
He couldn't move, but he could see beyond
the mountains huge black clouds pouring rain.

616
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,740
The river was rising, but Viki didn't seem
to realise.

617
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,490
Nelson called to her, but she couldn't hear
him.

618
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,410
He tried to go to her, but his feet were attached
to the rock.

619
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,840
He watched her as the river rose higher and
higher.

620
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:30,910
Then suddenly it caught her and she was swept
away, screaming for help.

621
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:35,299
Nelson woke with a jump and found he was sweating
and shouting her name.

622
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:37,420
It was morning.

623
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,200
He sat up and took a deep breath.

624
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,069
The dream faded fast.

625
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:46,750
He managed to forget about it altogether as
he showered.

626
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:52,170
Then he went to work, his first adult job.

627
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:58,859
When Daniel got home from school on the fifth
day after his mother's death, he found Eddy

628
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,730
sitting on the step.

629
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,470
'Hey,' he said with a big smile.

630
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,180
'You OK?'

631
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,610
'Better now,' Eddy answered.

632
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,349
Daniel sat down beside Eddy and they both
looked at the road.

633
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:14,319
'Where have you been?'

634
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:16,390
'Can't remember it all.'

635
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,640
Eddy laughed and Daniel joined in.

636
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,470
'But I got a job at that garage in Sector
C, like we said.'

637
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,940
'Hey, that's cool,' said Daniel.

638
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,650
'I have to live there.'

639
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,000
Eddy looked uncomfortable.

640
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,420
'They won't pay me any money, just food and
a bed.'

641
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,849
Daniel picked up a small stone.

642
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,670
'When are you going?'

643
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,940
'Tonight, so I'm there for work tomorrow.'

644
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,670
'Does Lily Anne know?' asked Daniel.

645
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,690
'She's packing my things.'

646
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,119
'When will we see you?'

647
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:55,869
'Maybe once a week, or...'

648
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:56,890
Eddy hesitated.

649
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,359
'If you need me I'll come.'

650
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,089
'Right.'

651
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,279
Daniel threw the stone up and caught it.

652
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:06,579
'You're the boss here now.'

653
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:09,930
Eddy was almost in tears.

654
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,930
'Yeah.

655
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,000
Except Lily Anne's the boss really...'

656
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,710
They both laughed again, and the moment passed.

657
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:20,100
Two friends of Eddy's were walking by and
saw him.

658
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:26,000
They came into the garden and shook his hand
and hugged him, laughing and joking.

659
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,740
Daniel stood up, unfolding his long legs.

660
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,849
He went and got his mbira and sang as the
laughter got louder:

661
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:35,819
You have no heart, they say.

662
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:37,799
You ran away, they say.

663
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:39,260
With a bottle in your mouth,

664
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,580
And a girl round your neck,

665
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,950
You didn't even check,

666
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,829
Your little brother wasn't crying,

667
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:46,620
While your mother finished dying.

668
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,990
Some more people came into the garden and
stood listening to Daniel.

669
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,279
The young men and Eddy stopped playing around.

670
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:56,779
Gone five days, they say.

671
00:39:56,779 --> 00:39:59,259
Lost your way, they say.

672
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:01,960
Lily Anne and Blessing had come out to join
the crowd.

673
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,400
People were clapping to the music now.

674
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,869
Eddy stood among them, listening and pretending
the clapping was for him, with a big smile

675
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:11,869
on his face.

676
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:14,780
Came home shamed, they say.

677
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,420
Can't be blamed, we say.

678
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,039
Now I have no mother,

679
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:21,589
It's good you're back, big brother.

680
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:22,880
Welcome home.

681
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,380
Everyone started to laugh and dance around.

682
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,730
'Welcome home,' they called and sang to Eddy.

683
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,890
'Welcome home.'

684
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,890
***

685
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:39,799
For Nelson the days passed quickly as he learned
about the hotel.

686
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:46,650
His father had his own way of doing things,
so he had to 'unlearn' much of what he'd studied.

687
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,440
Fletcher kept an eye on him and reported to
Mr Mbizi every day.

688
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,680
A week after he'd started, Nelson found his
father at the breakfast table.

689
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,930
'Hi, Dad,' he said as he sat down.

690
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,549
'I was wondering when I'd get paid.

691
00:41:02,549 --> 00:41:07,960
I'd like to meet up with some friends, start
a savings account, all that grown-up stuff.

692
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,230
But I can't do anything without an income.'

693
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,740
Mr Mbizi was reading the paper.

694
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,440
He looked at Nelson over the top.

695
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,670
He didn't smile.

696
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,420
'You'll get paid when I'm convinced you're
worth it.

697
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,599
It's early days yet.

698
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,079
Fletcher will arrange a small advance if you
need pocket money.'

699
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:32,869
Then Mr Mbizi got up, his large stomach almost
knocking a plate off the table.

700
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:35,680
'See you later,' he said.

701
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,339
Nelson was angry.

702
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:43,079
But his father had always been able to make
him angry and he decided to be patient a bit

703
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,750
longer.

704
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:49,320
He did meet up with some friends one evening
and they talked about sport and music.

705
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:55,349
They were enthusiastic about Kundai Kambera,
a South African pop star that Nelson hadn't

706
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:58,500
heard of, who was only a year older than they
were.

707
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:04,980
They weren't interested in England, and wanted
to discuss girlfriends and how to avoid HIV,

708
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,059
and of course the price of cars.

709
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:13,599
Nelson didn't feel at home with them.

710
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,599
***

711
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,510
The next morning, Nelson was at the top of
the stairs when he heard his mother and father

712
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,130
arguing in their bedroom.

713
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,750
When he was a child, he used to hide and listen
when they argued.

714
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:29,520
Now he just stood outside their door, hoping
those days were over.

715
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,539
His father's voice wasn't very clear, but
he seemed to be saying something about 'not

716
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:38,730
my only son'.

717
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,599
Ruby was shouting as she opened the door to
leave.

718
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:47,940
'Well, he may not be your only son, Washington
Mbizi, but he's the only one in the eyes of

719
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,940
the law.

720
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,800
He's the only one with your name.

721
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,990
He's the only one with a good education, and
he's the only one you can trust.'

722
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:00,230
She banged the door shut and ran down the
stairs.

723
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:05,099
Nelson stepped quickly aside and she didn't
see him.

724
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:06,700
He walked slowly to his room.

725
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:14,130
He knew his father had had girlfriends - everybody
knew - and he'd guessed there were other children.

726
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:17,030
But why was this an issue now?

727
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:22,750
And was it anything to do with his father
avoiding paying him - did his father want

728
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,500
another son to run the hotels?

729
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:32,189
Mr Mbizi didn't appear at the hotel all day.

730
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:33,189
***

731
00:43:33,189 --> 00:43:38,809
That evening, Ruby came into the little sitting
room where Nelson was watching a film on TV.

732
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:44,330
She sat down and said, 'I want you to take
one of your cousins to the movies, instead

733
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,539
of sitting here on your own.'

734
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:48,000
'Oh, Mum.

735
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,720
They're just not my type.'

736
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,130
Nelson's eyes didn't leave the screen.

737
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,980
'How do you know?

738
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,059
You've hardly seen them since you were all
tiny.

739
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:00,869
You'd feel a lot better with a girlfriend.'

740
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:02,570
Ruby touched Nelson's arm.

741
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,490
'I feel fine, Mum,' Nelson replied, still
watching TV.

742
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,750
'Well, you don't look fine.

743
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:15,339
You hardly ever smile now, and you spend all
your time on hotel business,' said Ruby.

744
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:18,080
'There's a lot to learn,' Nelson said.

745
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,690
When his mother didn't reply, he turned to
her.

746
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:27,859
'Mum, what's this business about... about
my being...

747
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:30,750
only one of Dad's sons?'

748
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,779
'How did you...?

749
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:36,210
Nelson, you are his only son.'

750
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,190
'Well, yes, with you, Mum.

751
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:41,190
But...'

752
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,779
Ruby stood up.

753
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:44,960
'You are legally his only son.'

754
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,589
'I know.

755
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:48,849
Don't get upset, Mum.

756
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:51,460
I just wondered...'

757
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,280
Ruby walked to the door and turned.

758
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,089
'I will not rest until you have everything
you've worked for, whatever your father is

759
00:44:59,089 --> 00:45:00,230
planning.'

760
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,550
She went out and closed the door.

761
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,060
Nelson swore quietly.

762
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,470
He wasn't even sure he wanted to spend his
whole life in hotels.

763
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:14,790
He already found the constant demands of guests
with too much money and a high opinion of

764
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:16,710
themselves very tiring.

765
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,829
He might not want 'everything he had worked
for'.

766
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:24,359
Why couldn't his parents just tell him what
was going on?

767
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:27,320
He was an adult now.

768
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,260
He gave up trying to watch the film and started
changing channels to see what else was on.

769
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:38,589
As the pictures flashed on and off, he heard
the name Daniel.

770
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:41,220
He went back a station.

771
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:46,920
Viki's beautiful eyes were looking straight
at him and she was saying, 'Daniel Mawadza

772
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,490
doesn't want to talk on camera.

773
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:53,359
He says that when bad things happen he makes
them into music.

774
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,920
He plays mbira and sings.

775
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,710
Listen to him now...'

776
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:08,910
And there was Daniel sitting under the jacaranda
tree singing to the small crowd.

777
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:11,029
CHAPTER FIVE

778
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:12,029
Face to face

779
00:46:12,029 --> 00:46:17,330
Nelson's heart began to beat like a drum.

780
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:22,070
His breath was shaky and he found he was grinning
from ear to ear.

781
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,790
He jumped up and ran out into the dark garden.

782
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:29,500
He tore off his clothes and dived into the
swimming pool.

783
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:35,119
He swam up and down for a long time, until
he was calm enough to think.

784
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,770
At last he knew what he wanted to do.

785
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:42,380
He needed information - and money.

786
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:46,410
Next morning, Nelson was in the restaurant
with the manager planning a dinner for two

787
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,299
hundred when he got a message.

788
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:52,130
His father wanted to see him in his office.

789
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:57,779
Nelson came out of the lift and saw his father
through the door, talking on the phone.

790
00:46:57,779 --> 00:47:02,690
Mr Mbizi was bent over, talking very quietly
for once.

791
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:09,250
Nelson stood in the doorway until his father
saw him and gestured him to come in and sit

792
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,360
down.

793
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:16,780
Washington Mbizi's face was grey when he put
down the phone, but his voice was as loud

794
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,809
as ever.

795
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:20,519
'So, what do you think of that restaurant
manager?

796
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:24,900
Is he doing a good job?' he asked Nelson.

797
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,440
Nelson thought for a moment.

798
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,990
'He doesn't know a lot about the latest fashions
in menus, but he's excellent at organising,'

799
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:33,990
he said.

800
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:38,730
'I was thinking of taking on a new man - younger.'

801
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:43,740
'It's not my decision,' said Nelson, 'but
I wouldn't start someone completely new as

802
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,570
the manager, maybe as an assistant at first.'

803
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:52,250
Nelson was looking carefully at his father,
waiting for his opportunity.

804
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,250
'Right.

805
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,990
I'll think about it.

806
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:55,990
OK.

807
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,349
That's all I wanted.'

808
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:59,990
Nelson stayed in his chair.

809
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,099
'Will you be at Parliament tomorrow?'

810
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:05,700
'I'm going there now,' Mr Mbizi said.

811
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,660
'Is your import-export bill going through?'

812
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,800
'Not yet.

813
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,000
It's scheduled for next week, but there's
a lot of opposition.'

814
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,380
Nelson took a breath.

815
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:23,220
'Dad, what can you tell me about the Health
Ministry's AIDS programmes?'

816
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,369
His father's eyes suddenly focused on Nelson's
face.

817
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:30,269
'You positive, then?' he asked roughly.

818
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:31,269
'No.

819
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:32,269
No.

820
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:33,269
I'm fine.

821
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:36,150
I had a test in the UK and...'

822
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:40,240
Nelson remembered his father's supposed adventures
away from home.

823
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,539
'I'm... careful.

824
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:46,670
But it seems there's not much money being
spent on clinics and social awareness for

825
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:47,670
AIDS.

826
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:48,900
Why's that?'

827
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,619
'Some ministries have budget cuts.'

828
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:57,370
His father turned his attention to collecting
papers from his desk.

829
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:03,660
'But how can the government cut the health
budget when so many are in danger?' asked

830
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,660
Nelson.

831
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,520
'Politics can be a dirty business,' his father
growled.

832
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:13,410
'So what happens to the money they cut from
the health budget?'

833
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,700
Nelson couldn't believe what his father was
hinting at.

834
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,410
Was someone stealing public money?

835
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,250
'Don't ask.

836
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:25,190
I'm just grateful that so far I haven't had
any cuts in my ministry.

837
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,190
I've got to go.'

838
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:31,359
Mr Mbizi stood up and came round from behind
the desk.

839
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,420
Nelson stood too.

840
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,670
'What do you care, anyway?'

841
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,030
his father asked.

842
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:39,090
'There's something else I wanted to ask you,
Dad.'

843
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,920
'Get on with it then.

844
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,480
I'm going to be late at Parliament.'

845
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:49,660
'It's about what you and Mum said the other
day about... other sons.

846
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,770
Have you...

847
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,089
Have I got brothers?'

848
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,049
'Not now, Nelson.'

849
00:49:55,049 --> 00:49:57,540
Mr Mbizi was getting angry.

850
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:01,930
'I asked Mum and she said I'm the only legal
son.

851
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:03,299
Why is she worried about that?'

852
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:05,960
'I don't have time for this now!

853
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,579
What does she know anyway?

854
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:11,849
Forget it, Nelson, and concentrate on your
work.

855
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:19,599
You still need to take more responsibility
for financial decisions and for checking things

856
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,599
are done properly.'

857
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:22,290
'In that case, Dad, I think I deserve a proper
salary.'

858
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:27,259
'Do you even know how the wine cellar is run?'

859
00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:28,940
Mr Mbizi's voice was rising.

860
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:33,339
'Do you have any idea of the costs of the
laundry?

861
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:35,430
No, you don't.

862
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:39,009
When you do, we'll talk about real money.'

863
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:43,740
'Dad, you know those are things I can learn
in a few minutes.

864
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,530
Why don't you want to pay me properly?'

865
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:49,980
Mr Mbizi turned and stood in front of Nelson,
chin to chin.

866
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:56,960
'In my eyes, you still have to prove you're
worth it!' he said.

867
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,420
The whites of his eyes had thick red veins
in them.

868
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,819
Nelson tried a different technique.

869
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:07,019
'You see, Dad, there's a reason I need some
real money now.

870
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:10,320
There's a family of kids I've met.

871
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,460
They've lost both their parents.'

872
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,010
'Which family?'

873
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,420
barked Mr Mbizi.

874
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,770
'They live in...

875
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,750
Sector D, Dad.

876
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:20,750
They...'

877
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:24,329
His father made a sudden movement and punched
Nelson in the face.

878
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:26,430
'What do you know about Sector D?

879
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:30,740
What the hell have you been doing?' screamed
Mr Mbizi.

880
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,710
Nelson fell back a step.

881
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,849
He put a hand to his lips and felt the blood.

882
00:51:36,849 --> 00:51:40,280
His father moved again and Nelson stepped
further back.

883
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,250
He tripped on a chair and almost fell.

884
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:48,640
Two men from the next-door office came in
and grabbed Mr Mbizi's arms as he prepared

885
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,560
to hit Nelson again.

886
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,509
Nelson was shaking.

887
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:58,029
He'd forgotten what this was like and the
shock that it used to give him.

888
00:51:58,029 --> 00:52:03,010
Part of him wanted to hit his father again
and again, and part of him wanted to cry like

889
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,869
a baby.

890
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:08,759
His father was fighting to get away from the
two men.

891
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:14,279
Nelson looked at him, took a deep breath and
said, 'If you want to talk to me about...

892
00:52:14,279 --> 00:52:19,150
any of this, I'll be at home this evening.'

893
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:22,770
And he turned and walked carefully to the
lift.

894
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:27,050
He went into an empty guest room to clean
his face and take some deep breaths.

895
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:32,849
The news would be all over the hotel by now,
and his father would have left for the Houses

896
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:35,150
of Parliament.

897
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:39,550
Nelson decided not to do anything until he'd
calmed down.

898
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:43,199
He went back to work.

899
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:44,199
***

900
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:48,980
That evening in Sector D, Eddy had time off
from the garage and came home for the evening.

901
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,710
He brought some sadza, so they had something
to eat.

902
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:57,750
Lily Anne, Blessing and Daniel had had nothing
to eat for nearly three days.

903
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:01,970
'Why didn't you tell me you had no food?'

904
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,049
Eddy asked Lily Anne.

905
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:08,460
'No money for the phone,' she said, as she
put the plates in the bucket to take to the

906
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,609
tap in the street to wash.

907
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:13,550
Eddy swore and looked at Daniel.

908
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:18,260
'We gotta do something, Dan,' he said.

909
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,609
Daniel looked at him with angry tears in his
eyes.

910
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:23,130
'We've got no money, Eddy.

911
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:28,130
I can't look for work because I have nothing
to make phone calls with, or to pay for the

912
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,769
combi to go looking.

913
00:53:29,769 --> 00:53:32,250
I don't know who can help us now.

914
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,720
Philomena doesn't come home till Friday and
it's only Wednesday.

915
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:40,900
The only people I know who might are my friend
Givemore's parents.

916
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,700
But they've got ten kids living in their house
now.'

917
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,769
He couldn't even try to make up a song, he
felt so exhausted.

918
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:51,880
In the dark outside, they heard a sound.

919
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:57,099
And then a voice called out, 'Knock, knock!'

920
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:00,529
Lily Anne sat down suddenly.

921
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:05,560
It was Tobias Nakula, the owner of the grocery
store on their street.

922
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,650
Eddy opened the door and asked Mr Nakula in.

923
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:14,970
He was short, almost fat, with round cheeks
and a smooth voice.

924
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:20,430
'Boys,' Mr Nakula began, smiling broadly in
the candlelight.

925
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:26,170
'Boys, did Lily Anne tell you I had a word
with her today?'

926
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:28,740
Daniel looked at Lily Anne.

927
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,369
She nodded slightly, looking at the bucket.

928
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:37,880
Mr Nakula went on, 'And I realise things are
very bad for you.'

929
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,730
'We're fine, thank you, Mr Nakula,' said Eddy.

930
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:44,700
'Of course.

931
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,970
But you see, I heard of someone who wants
to rent a house in this area.

932
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:52,349
And I thought that might be useful to you.

933
00:54:52,349 --> 00:54:57,220
If you could each find somewhere else to live,
then you could rent out your house and pay

934
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,869
for your food and schooling.'

935
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:02,299
Eddy and Daniel glanced at each other.

936
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,119
'Who is this someone, Mr Nakula?

937
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,049
Shall I telephone him?' asked Eddy.

938
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:10,329
'No need, Eddy.

939
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:14,240
I'll make the arrangements, if you agree.'

940
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,140
Daniel moved to open the door and spoke quietly.

941
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,549
'That's very good of you, Mr Nakula.

942
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:25,109
We'll drop in to the shop in the morning if
we decide that's what we want.'

943
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:26,109
'Right.

944
00:55:26,109 --> 00:55:27,109
OK.

945
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:28,630
Well, children.

946
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,839
Think carefully.

947
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:35,430
If you do decide, my mother and my brother
and I would be happy to give Lily Anne somewhere

948
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:38,269
to sleep and some food each day.

949
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:40,609
She could even go to school again.'

950
00:55:40,609 --> 00:55:44,900
'Where I go, Blessing goes,' said Lily Anne
suddenly.

951
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,590
'Ah... well.'

952
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:49,329
Mr Nakula sounded confused.

953
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:54,160
'I'd have to discuss that with Mother, but
I think it'd be possible.'

954
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,260
'Thank you, Mr Nakula,' said Eddy, showing
him out.

955
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:04,619
In case Mr Nakula was waiting to overhear
their conversation outside, Eddy whispered,

956
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:08,200
'I'd feel a lot better knowing you all had
enough to eat.'

957
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:14,690
Daniel whispered back, 'If Mrs Nakula will
take Blessing as well as Lily Anne, I reckon

958
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:18,470
I could persuade Givemore's mum to let me
sleep on their floor.'

959
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,450
'I don't trust that man,' said Lily Anne.

960
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:27,859
'But imagine living at the grocery store!'
said Daniel, and sang quietly:

961
00:56:27,859 --> 00:56:30,059
'Don't trust that man,' says Lily Anne,

962
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:32,319
But she'll get fat on cho-co-late,

963
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,760
And steak and cake and jam.'

964
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,920
'Yeah!' said Eddy, forgetting to whisper.

965
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,580
'You guys'll be bringing me food soon.'

966
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,619
And so the decision was made.

967
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:49,529
Lily Anne waited till they were all asleep,
dug up her last lucky coin from the earth

968
00:56:49,529 --> 00:56:57,930
floor in the corner, and slipped out of the
house into the ink-black night.

969
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:02,200
CHAPTER SIX

970
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,200
New homes

971
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:09,999
Nelson knew he was dreaming because the dried-up
gardens he was walking through were the gardens

972
00:57:09,999 --> 00:57:11,940
at his home.

973
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,349
He could hear Daniel singing in the distance.

974
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:20,359
He seemed to float towards the song and found
Daniel standing in the bottom of the empty

975
00:57:20,359 --> 00:57:23,930
swimming pool with dead leaves blowing around
his feet.

976
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:29,640
There were huge birds in the sky above, birds
that eat dead animals.

977
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:35,130
But they began to fly down and sit around
the edge of the swimming pool, listening.

978
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:39,730
The song was sweet, but heavy with sadness.

979
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,609
Nelson woke up.

980
00:57:41,609 --> 00:57:44,609
Had he heard the phone ringing?

981
00:57:44,609 --> 00:57:46,559
If he had, it had stopped now.

982
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,460
It was two o'clock in the morning.

983
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:54,329
The first thing he thought of as he lay awake
was the fight with his father.

984
00:57:54,329 --> 00:57:59,160
Mr Mbizi hadn't appeared all evening and there'd
been no messages.

985
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:04,480
The next thing he thought of was his anger
with himself because he hadn't stopped thinking

986
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,480
of Viki.

987
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:11,490
Was he trying to help the children because
that might result in his seeing her again?

988
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:14,640
Was that the only reason he cared about them?

989
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,450
'No, of course not,' he answered himself.

990
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:23,460
He'd been worried about them before he knew
she existed.

991
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:28,150
But his mind went on turning over all the
issues of the day before.

992
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:32,960
At last he made a decision and finally slept
a little.

993
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,460
In the morning he went to the hotel early.

994
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:41,829
He told Fletcher and the department managers
that he was going to take a day off the next

995
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:43,009
day.

996
00:58:43,009 --> 00:58:45,990
He'd brought his laptop with him to his tiny
office.

997
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:50,549
He got onto the Internet and began a search
for organisations that helped people with

998
00:58:50,549 --> 00:58:54,089
HIV and AIDS in Gomokure.

999
00:58:54,089 --> 00:58:58,190
He was looking for something that covered
the Sectors, but he'd found nothing relevant

1000
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:01,039
when his desk phone rang.

1001
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:05,440
'You asked me to let you know when your father
came in,' said Fletcher.

1002
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,829
'He's in his office now.'

1003
00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:08,400
'Thanks, Fletcher.

1004
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,349
Can you meet me there?'

1005
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:15,680
Nelson's heart was hammering as he went up
in the lift.

1006
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,140
'Good morning, Dad.

1007
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,250
Fletcher,' he said from the door.

1008
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:24,740
'What's all this about?' said Mr Mbizi loudly.

1009
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:30,079
'Dad, I've decided that if I'm to be the manager
of your hotels, so that you can deal with

1010
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,650
your government business properly, then I
deserve a decent salary.

1011
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:39,089
I want you to know that I'm going to go downstairs
and arrange with Fletcher to put me on the

1012
00:59:39,089 --> 00:59:44,269
books as an official employee of your company
at a suitable rate, and pay my first wages.

1013
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:47,990
I didn't want to do this behind your back.

1014
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:50,220
That's all.'

1015
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:54,499
Washington Mbizi's mouth was open in astonishment.

1016
00:59:54,499 --> 00:59:59,730
Fletcher looked from one to the other in fear,
waiting for the explosion.

1017
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:04,859
Nelson thought his father might get violent
again, so he stayed near the door.

1018
01:00:04,859 --> 01:00:07,329
No-one spoke.

1019
01:00:07,329 --> 01:00:12,680
'I'll see you in the basement, Fletcher,'
said Nelson after a long moment, and turned

1020
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,920
to go.

1021
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:21,200
As he did, he was puzzled to see his father
smiling a small, surprised smile.

1022
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,770
Nelson took the stairs down so as not to wait
for the lift.

1023
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:33,109
Nelson worked until almost midnight, but he
didn't see his father again that day.

1024
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:34,109
***

1025
01:00:34,109 --> 01:00:38,249
The next morning he borrowed the gardener's
truck again and drove to the bank.

1026
01:00:38,249 --> 01:00:44,119
He spent most of the morning opening a personal
bank account and making some enquiries about

1027
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:45,960
accounts for charities.

1028
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,329
Then he drove to Sector D.

1029
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:51,710
This time he went as himself.

1030
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:56,119
But number 1175 seemed different.

1031
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:01,020
There were now two new chairs and a wooden
table in the front yard and a strange woman

1032
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,579
went into the door as he approached.

1033
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:09,609
Nelson drove on and parked under the jacaranda
tree where Daniel had sung, worried by this

1034
01:01:09,609 --> 01:01:10,609
development.

1035
01:01:10,609 --> 01:01:14,490
It was lunch time, so there weren't many people
around.

1036
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:19,770
But as he got out of the truck, a silent crowd
of children and young people appeared and

1037
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:22,220
watched him.

1038
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:26,450
'Can anyone tell me where the Mawadza children
are?' he asked.

1039
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:33,289
'Daniel lives at number 1210 now,' answered
a young woman with a baby on her back.

1040
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:37,130
'It's in the next street, down nearer the
river.

1041
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,460
He's at school this morning.'

1042
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,049
'And Lily Anne and Blessing?'

1043
01:01:43,049 --> 01:01:44,390
The woman smiled.

1044
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,329
'They're lucky.

1045
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:48,560
They've gone to live with the Nakulas.

1046
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,829
They have the grocery store on the corner.'

1047
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:52,940
'Are they a family?

1048
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,730
What are they like?' asked Nelson.

1049
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,680
'It's two brothers and their mother.

1050
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,109
They're OK as long as your credit's good!'

1051
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:03,230
she said with a little laugh.

1052
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:07,900
'And... er... what's his name?

1053
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:08,900
The eldest one?'

1054
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:09,900
'Eddy,' replied the young woman.

1055
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,400
'He's got a job with bed and food in Sector
C.'

1056
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,950
'Why did they split up?'

1057
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,589
Nelson had to ask, although he could guess
the answer.

1058
01:02:18,589 --> 01:02:25,289
'They ran out of money, so Tobias Nakula arranged
for them to rent out their house.

1059
01:02:25,289 --> 01:02:27,180
He's going to send Lily Anne to school again.'

1060
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,200
'That's good,' said Nelson.

1061
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,650
'What time does Daniel come home from school?'

1062
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:36,239
One of the boys was older than the others.

1063
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:40,250
He stepped forward and said to Nelson, 'He'll
be back by now.

1064
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:43,499
I can show you where he lives if you like.'

1065
01:02:43,499 --> 01:02:46,049
'What's your name?' asked Nelson.

1066
01:02:46,049 --> 01:02:48,950
'Henry,' replied the boy, looking at the ground.

1067
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:50,160
'Come on then, Henry.

1068
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,819
Let's go and find Daniel.'

1069
01:02:52,819 --> 01:02:58,529
Henry's face split open in a wide grin as
he got into the truck with Nelson.

1070
01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:03,480
They drove off in a cloud of dust, and all
the other children looked after them with

1071
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,160
envy.

1072
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,160
***

1073
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:10,390
Daniel stood outside his friend Givemore Chivasa's
house.

1074
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:15,950
He looked at the bright flowers in the tidy
little yard and smelled the food cooking.

1075
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:18,369
He thought how lucky he was to be here.

1076
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:21,141
Mrs Chivasa called to him as he went in.

1077
01:03:21,141 --> 01:03:24,739
'Food's on the table, Daniel.

1078
01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:26,170
Where's Givemore?'

1079
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,609
'He's coming.

1080
01:03:27,609 --> 01:03:30,099
He's chatting with some friends.'

1081
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:35,359
'Girlfriends, I imagine,' laughed Mrs Chivasa.

1082
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,329
'Hmm...

1083
01:03:37,329 --> 01:03:38,859
It smells really good.'

1084
01:03:38,859 --> 01:03:40,420
Daniel sat down to eat.

1085
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:45,619
Three other children were there already and
they made a lot of noise joking and laughing

1086
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:48,220
at each other.

1087
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:51,890
So Daniel wasn't sure he heard a car door
shut until a man's voice called out from the

1088
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:53,769
gate, 'Knock, knock!'

1089
01:03:53,769 --> 01:03:58,930
'Who's that?' said Mrs Chivasa as she went
through to the front door.

1090
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:01,799
Daniel heard her say, 'Can I help you?'

1091
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:04,269
'I'm looking for Daniel Mawadza.

1092
01:04:04,269 --> 01:04:09,509
I'm a friend of his friend Philomena's,' said
the voice.

1093
01:04:09,509 --> 01:04:14,720
It was an educated voice, too educated for
Sector D. 'My name's Nelson.'

1094
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,930
Mrs Chivasa said 'Ah, of course.

1095
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,079
I'm Primrose Chivasa.

1096
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,819
Please come in.'

1097
01:04:21,819 --> 01:04:24,460
Daniel had almost finished his food.

1098
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,410
He stopped eating as Nelson came in.

1099
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:30,880
The other children sat suddenly silent.

1100
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:37,259
Nelson was wearing real Levi jeans and a leather
jacket, which astonished Daniel.

1101
01:04:37,259 --> 01:04:41,670
Could Philomena really have friends like this,
so good-looking, so wealthy?

1102
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,269
'Would you like something to eat?'

1103
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:45,579
Mrs Chivasa asked.

1104
01:04:45,579 --> 01:04:48,999
'Thank you, but I've eaten.'

1105
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:52,700
Nelson smiled, and Mrs Chivasa sat down at
the table.

1106
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:58,319
Nelson's skin shone black and his teeth were
very white in contrast.

1107
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,200
He sat down opposite Daniel.

1108
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,480
'Hello, Daniel.

1109
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,410
You don't know me, but I know Philomena.'

1110
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:05,410
'Ah...'

1111
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:09,579
Daniel realised who this shining young man
must be.

1112
01:05:09,579 --> 01:05:11,759
'How is she?'

1113
01:05:11,759 --> 01:05:13,609
'She's fine,' said Nelson.

1114
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:16,989
'Hello, everyone,' Nelson said to the other
children.

1115
01:05:16,989 --> 01:05:21,759
They all greeted him shyly, and then sat in
silence.

1116
01:05:21,759 --> 01:05:23,779
Nelson went on, 'I saw you on television,
Daniel.'

1117
01:05:23,779 --> 01:05:26,930
'We were on TV?

1118
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:29,299
Hey, that's great!'

1119
01:05:29,299 --> 01:05:30,299
Daniel grinned.

1120
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:35,099
'I wondered whether the TV people had come
back or been in touch with you again.'

1121
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:39,690
'The reporter woman did say she would talk
to people about my singing.

1122
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:41,940
But I haven't heard...'

1123
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,190
'Nobody else?'

1124
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:45,650
Daniel saw Nelson was disappointed.

1125
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,829
'No.

1126
01:05:46,829 --> 01:05:51,559
But the cameraman, Phil, he left me his card.'

1127
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:52,700
Nelson smiled.

1128
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,760
'Ah.

1129
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,140
And do you still have it?'

1130
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:58,760
'Sure.'

1131
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,760
Daniel stood up and opened his school bag.

1132
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,970
Are you going to call him?'

1133
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:07,260
'I want to ask what people said about the
programme.'

1134
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:11,489
'Well, nobody's said anything to me,' said
Daniel.

1135
01:06:11,489 --> 01:06:13,569
'Maybe it wasn't showing on our local TV.'

1136
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:20,230
'No, it was on satellite, from Jo'burg, on
Sunday.'

1137
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:26,359
Daniel handed Nelson the card and noticed
how long and slim and smooth his fingers were.

1138
01:06:26,359 --> 01:06:31,339
'Thanks,' said Nelson as he wrote out Phil's
number on a piece of paper and put it in his

1139
01:06:31,339 --> 01:06:32,339
pocket.

1140
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:38,430
He gave the card back to Daniel and asked,
'And how are you?'

1141
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:39,859
Daniel picked up his mbira.

1142
01:06:39,859 --> 01:06:42,410
'I'm just fine, thanks.

1143
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:47,470
We're all eating again, and it looks as though
there might be money for me and Lily Anne

1144
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:48,789
to finish our schooling.

1145
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:51,510
And this family is very kind.'

1146
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:54,319
He began to play and sing.

1147
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:55,660
Mama's always singing

1148
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:57,450
and Papa's always bringing

1149
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:59,989
the money home to feed us.

1150
01:06:59,989 --> 01:07:05,279
They even say they need us!

1151
01:07:05,279 --> 01:07:06,279
The children all clapped and laughed.

1152
01:07:06,279 --> 01:07:09,880
Nelson asked, Are you both here then, you
and your brother?'

1153
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:14,290
'Well, Eddy lives at the garage where he works.

1154
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,759
He finally came back.'

1155
01:07:15,759 --> 01:07:16,759
Daniel grinned.

1156
01:07:16,759 --> 01:07:18,970
'I made a song about him.

1157
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:20,380
Want to hear it?'

1158
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:21,380
'Yeah!'

1159
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,630
shouted the children.

1160
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:25,420
Nelson laughed.

1161
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:28,109
'Another time, Daniel.

1162
01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:30,970
What about Lily Anne and Blessing?

1163
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:32,910
Are they OK?'

1164
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,210
Daniel laughed.

1165
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:35,210
'Yeah.

1166
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:37,579
They're in the best place - the grocery store!

1167
01:07:37,579 --> 01:07:42,220
The only thing they don't have there is the
traditional medicine for Blessing.'

1168
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:44,619
'Well,' said Nelson as he stood up.

1169
01:07:44,619 --> 01:07:45,780
'That's great.

1170
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:49,999
I'd heard from Philomena about your mother's
death...'

1171
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:55,549
Daniel stood up too and interrupted, 'So your
mother is Mrs Mbizi?'

1172
01:07:55,549 --> 01:07:59,609
'That's right,' replied Nelson, looking puzzled.

1173
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:03,490
'Nice woman, your mother.'

1174
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:06,920
Daniel made it clear with his voice that he
didn't mean it.

1175
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,799
'Hey!' said Nelson.

1176
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:11,869
'Don't judge her till you know her.'

1177
01:08:11,869 --> 01:08:12,960
'OK.

1178
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:18,540
I'll try,' said Daniel with a twisted smile.

1179
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:19,900
Nelson turned to go.

1180
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:24,200
'Thank you, Mrs Chivasa, for taking Daniel
into your home.

1181
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,830
I see you have a lot of other children living
with you.'

1182
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,980
'It's our pleasure, Mr Mbizi.

1183
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:33,320
He's a good boy and he keeps the other children
amused.'

1184
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:37,980
She gestured for Nelson to go in front of
her to the door.

1185
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,090
Daniel followed Nelson and Mrs Chivasa.

1186
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:45,900
In the front yard, he touched Nelson's arm
and looked into his face as he said, 'I've

1187
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,100
got to say thanks to you.

1188
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:51,620
Thanks for coming, thanks for remembering
us.

1189
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:58,430
Looks to me like your mother gave all her
heart to her son when you were born.'

1190
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:03,520
Nelson had to look up a bit to see into Daniel's
warm brown eyes.

1191
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,609
'She's very loyal to her own,' he said.

1192
01:09:05,609 --> 01:09:09,720
'As I'm sure your mother was.'

1193
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,650
Daniel felt his eyes suddenly fill with tears.

1194
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:16,020
'Yeah,' he said, looking down.

1195
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:18,980
The tears splashed into the dust.

1196
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,480
'Anyway, we're all OK for now.'

1197
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,840
'I'll let you know if I learn anything from
Phil.'

1198
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:29,450
Nelson turned to Mrs Chivasa and shook her
hand.

1199
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:30,960
'It was good to meet you.

1200
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,670
Goodbye,' he said.

1201
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:38,000
'Stay well,' said Mrs Chivasa in the traditional
way.

1202
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Daniel watched Nelson get into a shining dark
blue truck and drive away slowly so as not

1203
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,640
to make too much dust.

1204
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:50,460
Daniel turned to Mrs Chivasa and began to
dance her round the garden singing Kundai

1205
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:55,480
Kambera's greatest hit 'He's my saviour, I'm
his friend'.

1206
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,480
***

1207
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:01,120
Nelson dropped Henry off and drove back to
the main road.

1208
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:06,020
He parked in the first place he could find
and called Phil's number in Johannesburg from

1209
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,020
his mobile.

1210
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:11,060
It was such a relief to know he could pay
the bill himself now.

1211
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:13,110
A cheerful voice said, 'Yebo?

1212
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:14,110
Phil here.'

1213
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:16,410
'Hi, is that Phil the cameraman?'

1214
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:17,410
'Yeah.

1215
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:18,410
Who's this?'

1216
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:24,340
'I'm interested in those people in Sector
D in Chapangana.

1217
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:27,920
You filmed them a couple of weeks back.

1218
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,040
The singing guy, Daniel, gave me your number.

1219
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,190
I'm Nelson.'

1220
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:36,020
'Hi, Nelson,' said Phil.

1221
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,780
'How're they getting on?'

1222
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:42,370
'They've run out of money, so they've rented
out their house, but that means they've split

1223
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,920
the family up.'

1224
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,440
'That's usually a bad sign.'

1225
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,900
'Yeah,' agreed Nelson.

1226
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:52,360
'But they seem to be OK for now.

1227
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,360
It's just...

1228
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:59,500
Daniel has written some more songs, so I wondered
if you'd be doing another report on them.'

1229
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:05,390
'There was some talk a couple of days ago
about something else in that area, but nothing

1230
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:06,500
for sure.'

1231
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:11,160
'Would it be better if I contacted what's
her name?

1232
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,340
The reporter?'

1233
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:15,990
Nelson hoped Phil couldn't hear his heartbeat.

1234
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:16,990
'Viki?

1235
01:11:16,990 --> 01:11:19,000
I doubt it.

1236
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:27,250
She's not always very... pleasant and, well,
she can be, like, really poisonous at times.'

1237
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,040
'Hmm.

1238
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,850
OK.

1239
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:31,850
I'll get in touch with you, then.'

1240
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:35,770
'I'll give you her number, if you like.

1241
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:38,870
But don't be surprised if she cuts you off!'

1242
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:41,660
Phil gave a small, sad laugh.

1243
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:43,060
'Right.

1244
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:44,460
OK.

1245
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:45,870
Thanks.'

1246
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:49,650
Nelson tried to sound bored as he wrote down
the number.

1247
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:54,000
When he hung up, part of him wanted to call
Viki immediately.

1248
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,900
But part of him ridiculed the idea.

1249
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,800
'To say what?' he thought.

1250
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:02,080
'And anyway, she's not worth the cost of the
call.'

1251
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:08,690
Perhaps he'd get an idea about what to say
if he checked out the Network 10 website.

1252
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:10,630
He drove home too fast.

1253
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:11,630
CHAPTER SEVEN

1254
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:12,630
Rescue

1255
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:18,960
Late that afternoon, Nelson was in his room
researching on the Internet.

1256
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:25,910
He had learned everything about Network 10,
but nothing more about Viki than he knew already,

1257
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:27,000
except her surname.

1258
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:33,250
He had started looking again at sites concerning
AIDS in Gomokure, when the phone rang and

1259
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:36,120
he heard his mother answer it in the hall
downstairs.

1260
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:41,180
'Please don't call this number if you want
to speak to Philomena.'

1261
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,253
His mother's voice was raised in anger.

1262
01:12:42,253 --> 01:12:48,820
There was a pause and then, 'Well, all right
this once.

1263
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:55,963
But never again,' and a loud, 'Philomena!

1264
01:12:55,963 --> 01:12:56,963
Where are you?'

1265
01:12:56,963 --> 01:12:58,210
Nelson got up and went to the top of the stairs.

1266
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:00,990
'Who is it, Mum?'

1267
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:02,370
'Some kid.

1268
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:03,760
Where's Philomena?'

1269
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,300
At that moment Philomena came running.

1270
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,691
'Sorry, madam,' she said and took the telephone
carefully from Ruby.

1271
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:16,830
Ruby threw Philomena an angry look and marched
off to her sitting room.

1272
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:20,790
Nelson stood at the top of the stairs.

1273
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:24,910
What could be so urgent in Philomena's life
that meant her friends had broken the rule

1274
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:27,540
about phoning?

1275
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:28,660
Philomena put the phone down.

1276
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:32,750
Nelson cleared his throat so she would know
he was watching.

1277
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:35,470
'Oh, Mr Nelson!'

1278
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:37,330
She looked up with frightened eyes.

1279
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,280
'Are you busy?

1280
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,030
Could you give me some advice?'

1281
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:45,230
Nelson ran down the stairs and they both went
out into the garden.

1282
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:47,830
'Who was that?' he asked.

1283
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:49,510
'It was Lily Anne.

1284
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:54,330
She stole a coin from Mr Nakula to call me
again.

1285
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,510
She's frightened.'

1286
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:57,650
Philomena was crying.

1287
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:59,410
'What's happened?'

1288
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:00,660
Nelson asked urgently.

1289
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:05,460
'She called me during the night last night
to ask me what to do.

1290
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:06,600
Oh, God.

1291
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,370
I should have gone to her...'

1292
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:10,700
'Just tell me what has happened.'

1293
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:19,020
Philomena stared across the lawn as she said,
'Tobias Nakula and his brother have tried

1294
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,750
to have sex with her.'

1295
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,560
'What?'

1296
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,710
Nelson felt sick.

1297
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,060
'Did they succeed?'

1298
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:34,130
'Lily Anne says she managed to knock over
a vase which broke, so their mother Mrs Nakula

1299
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:36,520
came in and they left her alone.

1300
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:42,420
Now she has to pay for the vase, but she's
very afraid to stay, and Blessing won't stop

1301
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,520
crying.'

1302
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,870
'What do you want to do?'

1303
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:46,870
Nelson asked.

1304
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:47,870
'I...

1305
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:50,870
I just want to get her out of there.'

1306
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:53,340
'Come on then,' said Nelson.

1307
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,420
'Let's just go and get her.

1308
01:14:55,420 --> 01:15:00,250
We can take her to your house and then decide
what to do.'

1309
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,310
Philomena looked up at him with sudden hope.

1310
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:05,060
'I'll get my keys,' she said.

1311
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:09,470
The sun was going down as they set off in
the gardener's truck.

1312
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:12,390
Nelson drove fast in the failing light.

1313
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:15,340
'I thought the Nakulas were a good family.

1314
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:19,140
Everyone was pleased Lily Anne had been so
lucky.'

1315
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,470
'Yes.

1316
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:21,590
We all were.

1317
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:23,510
This is hard to believe.'

1318
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:25,920
Philomena thought for a while.

1319
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,450
'It may be that one or both of the brothers
are HIV positive, I suppose.

1320
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:36,910
Some men believe that if they are the first
to have sex with a girl they'll be cured of

1321
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:37,910
HIV.'

1322
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:40,150
'But that's a complete lie!'

1323
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:43,020
exclaimed Nelson.

1324
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:44,020
Philomena was quiet.

1325
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:51,140
After a while she said, 'I thought of offering
them my house when I heard they'd split up.

1326
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:56,100
But little Blessing is HIV positive and I'm
not sure about the others.

1327
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:59,840
If they lived with me, I might get it too.'

1328
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:05,501
'Not if you didn't have sex with them or get
some of their blood into your body,' said

1329
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:06,690
Nelson quietly.

1330
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:11,900
'Isn't their spit dangerous too?' asked Philomena.

1331
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:12,900
'No.

1332
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:17,080
It's only blood and the... er... sex liquids.'

1333
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:20,790
Nelson felt himself blushing.

1334
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:25,780
Philomena had worked for his mother since
he was born, and he felt impolite discussing

1335
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:29,620
these things with her, however important they
were.

1336
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:32,010
'Ah,' said Philomena.

1337
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:34,750
They drove on in embarrassed silence.

1338
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:40,960
The embarrassment lasted until they were parking
outside number 1163, Philomena's house.

1339
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:45,430
It was already completely dark and there were
no street lights on.

1340
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:50,370
There was quiet music coming from somewhere
nearby.

1341
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:51,700
Philomena broke the mood.

1342
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:57,250
'You know, Mr Nelson, it's a good thing there
wasn't much traffic on the road.'

1343
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:59,080
Nelson laughed nervously.

1344
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,310
'You're right.

1345
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:05,210
I don't usually drive that fast,' he said.

1346
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:08,890
Philomena unlocked her front door and turned
on the light.

1347
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:13,350
She began uncovering her kitchen things and
arranging for visitors.

1348
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:17,300
'I think it's best if I go alone to start
with.

1349
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:22,120
I'll say the children are coming to stay with
me for now.

1350
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,690
Then we can decide what to do.'

1351
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:26,900
'Fine,' agreed Nelson.

1352
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,130
'I'll wait here for ten minutes.

1353
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:32,990
If you haven't come back, I'll start walking
to the shop.

1354
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:37,420
Um... you did understand what I was saying
in the car?'

1355
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:42,250
'About HIV being only in blood and, er...

1356
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,280
Yes, Mr Nelson.

1357
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:49,230
We'll get her away from them, whatever it
takes.'

1358
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:55,850
Philomena touched a small bag that hung by
her door and then stepped out into the dark.

1359
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:59,350
Nelson sat and listened to her soft footsteps.

1360
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:03,170
He tried to be calm, but found he couldn't
sit still.

1361
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:09,020
Philomena, a grown woman with intelligence
and some education, hadn't known basic facts

1362
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,130
about HIV.

1363
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:15,320
How many others still misunderstood this infection?

1364
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,500
He looked at his watch.

1365
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,420
Only two minutes gone.

1366
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:25,670
Philomena had some cheap but clean furniture
and there was a shelf with some books on.

1367
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:28,920
He opened one and read a few paragraphs.

1368
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:34,200
He looked round the curtain into the other
room and saw a bed and a wardrobe in there.

1369
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,600
He checked his watch.

1370
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,060
Eight minutes had gone.

1371
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:41,290
Long enough, he decided.

1372
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:42,940
He switched off the light.

1373
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:47,380
The door made almost no noise as he opened
and then closed it.

1374
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:51,770
He stood outside for a few moments to get
used to the dark.

1375
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:56,690
But before he could do anything, he heard
quiet voices and footsteps coming towards

1376
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:57,690
him.

1377
01:18:57,690 --> 01:19:01,640
Philomena was bringing the children to her
house.

1378
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:05,500
Nelson could see that Lily Anne was in a state
of shock.

1379
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:11,000
Her breathing was irregular and her eyes wide
and unblinking.

1380
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,130
Philomena was carrying Blessing.

1381
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:14,420
He was asleep.

1382
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:18,650
Nelson and Philomena made a bed for them on
the sofa.

1383
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:26,300
Lily Anne sat on the edge, beside the sleeping
Blessing, looking at her pink shoes.

1384
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,940
Philomena made some hot milk from milk powder.

1385
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:35,220
Nelson sat down on a chair by the sofa and
took one of Lily Anne's hands gently in his.

1386
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:39,530
'Lily Anne, I know you've had a shock.

1387
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:44,660
But please try to tell me what happened,'
Nelson said gently.

1388
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:48,560
She looked up into his face, her eyes full
of tears.

1389
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:52,810
'It was my fault,' she said.

1390
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:59,990
'It was all my fault and now they'll take
the house away from us and we'll have nothing,

1391
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:01,960
and I have to pay for the broken vase.'

1392
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:07,380
Nelson and Philomena looked at each other
in surprise.

1393
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:12,260
Philomena made a sign and Nelson got up and
went out.

1394
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:15,340
He stood just outside the door, listening.

1395
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:19,150
Nelson heard Philomena sit on the chair by
Lily Anne.

1396
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:21,780
'Why is it your fault?'

1397
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:22,780
she asked.

1398
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:25,750
Lily Anne took a deep breath.

1399
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:30,180
'I got food from Mr Nakula without paying.

1400
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:38,110
Ever since Dad died, if we had no money, I
knew I could get food there if I smiled at

1401
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:39,110
him.'

1402
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:40,110
'Smiled?'

1403
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:41,110
Philomena asked.

1404
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:42,110
'Yes.

1405
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:46,001
I saw the girls at the bottle store smile
at the men who go there.

1406
01:20:46,001 --> 01:20:49,660
Then the men would give them money.

1407
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:52,680
So I used that smile on Mr Nakula.'

1408
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:56,080
'I see,' said Philomena.

1409
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:59,490
'I know what it means, that smile.'

1410
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:02,890
Lily Anne's voice held a hint of a boast.

1411
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:07,920
'I know it means, "I'll let you have sex with
me one day."

1412
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,950
But I knew Mr Nakula was afraid of Mum, too.

1413
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,710
So I thought I'd never have to pay the debt...'

1414
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:20,660
'So when you called and asked me how to stop
it if the brothers tried something, you weren't

1415
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,270
asking "just in case".

1416
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:25,190
You knew they would.'

1417
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:26,920
Philomena sounded a bit cross.

1418
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,080
'Yes, Aunt Philomena.

1419
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,110
I didn't tell you everything.

1420
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:32,110
I'm sorry.

1421
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:38,550
And your idea of telling them that Mum's ghost
was watching me stopped them for a while.

1422
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:39,550
But...

1423
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:42,930
I think Mr Nakula's brother is sick.

1424
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:46,040
He smells like Dad did.

1425
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,810
I think he wanted...'

1426
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:52,370
Lily Anne made a sound as though she was going
to be sick.

1427
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:58,190
Nelson heard Philomena move quickly and then
Lily Anne was noisily sick into something

1428
01:21:58,190 --> 01:21:59,190
plastic.

1429
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:02,180
'OK, now, Lily Anne.

1430
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:06,200
It's OK now,' whispered Philomena.

1431
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,710
'Sick it all out.

1432
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:10,910
You'll be better when it's gone.'

1433
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:14,420
Blessing began to stir.

1434
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:16,120
Philomena appeared at the door.

1435
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:19,580
'Please come in now, Mr Nelson.

1436
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:24,110
We have to decide what to do,' she said in
a low voice.

1437
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:29,730
Nelson came in and sat down quietly beside
Lily Anne while Philomena gave Blessing some

1438
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:31,820
milk in a cup.

1439
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:33,120
This made him cough.

1440
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,770
Lily Anne took the cup from Philomena.

1441
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:41,310
'He can eat and drink most days,' she said.

1442
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:45,580
'But sometimes he's too sick.'

1443
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:49,160
Philomena looked at Nelson and they went outside.

1444
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:57,010
She said, 'I'm afraid to have them both here,
with Blessing HIV positive, and perhaps Lily

1445
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:58,100
Anne too.'

1446
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:01,140
Nelson was thinking.

1447
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:04,860
He couldn't remember how many rooms for staff
there were at his home.

1448
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:12,960
'And Lily Anne has told me, Mr Nelson,' Philomena
went on, 'that she has started her monthly

1449
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:13,960
bleeding.

1450
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:19,600
It's difficult to keep her clean here, with
no water in the house.

1451
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:24,620
There's an empty room at your house, in the
staff cottage where we live.

1452
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:28,540
Could we take them there, just for tonight?'

1453
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:29,730
Nelson was relieved.

1454
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:32,040
'Of course, Philomena.

1455
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,710
That would be best.

1456
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:38,530
They can stay a day or two and we'll get them
to a clinic for tests.

1457
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:42,730
Just try not to let my mother see them!'

1458
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:47,510
CHAPTER EIGHT

1459
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:48,510
The hospice

1460
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:56,690
Nelson had to be at the hotel all the next
day, but Philomena took the children for HIV

1461
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:57,850
tests.

1462
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:03,080
When Nelson got home she told him that Blessing
was definitely HIV positive and that Lily

1463
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,100
Anne was negative so far.

1464
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:10,390
Philomena had also been out to Sector D on
the bus to pay for the vase with money Nelson

1465
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:13,700
had given her, and get the childrens things.

1466
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:19,220
She'd told Mrs Chivasa what had happened,
but Mr and Mrs Mbizi knew nothing about it.

1467
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:26,866
Nelson ate alone as neither of his parents
was at home, and then went up to his room

1468
01:24:26,866 --> 01:24:30,000
and began searching the Internet again for
an organisation that could help.

1469
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:37,140
Some time later, he found the name of a hospice
that took in people who were dying of AIDS,

1470
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:39,860
so that they could die peacefully and with
less pain.

1471
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:45,960
There was no website, but there was a phone
number and it seemed to be in an area about

1472
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,300
half an hour by car from Sector D.

1473
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:52,240
'At last!' he said to himself, and dialed
on his mobile.

1474
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,680
'Hello, Saint John's Hospice.'

1475
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:59,320
It was a woman's voice with a strong Irish
accent.

1476
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,330
'How can we help?'

1477
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:03,130
'Good evening.

1478
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:04,130
I...

1479
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:08,860
I've met a family of orphans in Sector D in
Chapangana who need help.

1480
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:12,100
They've had to move out of their home.

1481
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:13,980
Do you take in children?'

1482
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:14,980
Nelson asked.

1483
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,165
'We try to help people with AIDS in their
own homes.'

1484
01:25:16,165 --> 01:25:20,430
The woman sounded warm and caring.

1485
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:22,750
'Are they HIV positive?'

1486
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:23,750
'Right...

1487
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:28,670
Well, they have no home now, and the youngest
one is.

1488
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:31,140
But he's very small and his sister won't leave
him.'

1489
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:33,510
'And they have nowhere to go.

1490
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:36,020
How old is the sister?'

1491
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:39,980
Nelson could hear a smile in the woman's voice.

1492
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:41,980
'She's twelve, I think.

1493
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:42,980
Could you take them both?'

1494
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:47,230
'Would you like to bring them over for a look
first?'

1495
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:48,290
'Yes.

1496
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:49,350
Thanks.

1497
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:51,260
My name is Nelson.

1498
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:52,810
And you are?'

1499
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:54,150
'I'm Sister Michael.'

1500
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:55,150
'Sister Michael?

1501
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,150
Right.

1502
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:57,150
Thank you, Sister Michael.

1503
01:25:57,150 --> 01:26:02,500
May I bring them tomorrow morning, before
I go to work?'

1504
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,320
'You may.

1505
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,130
See you then, young man.'

1506
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:10,560
Nelson put the phone down with a smile on
his face.

1507
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:15,100
If this went well, the children would be gone
and safe before his parents knew anything

1508
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,100
about them.

1509
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:20,730
He went down to the kitchen to get a drink
before he slept.

1510
01:26:20,730 --> 01:26:26,080
As he passed his parents' bedroom door he
heard drawers opening and shutting and feet

1511
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,950
moving around.

1512
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:28,950
He knocked.

1513
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:32,470
His mother came to the door, closing it behind
her.

1514
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:36,420
Are you OK, Mum?' he asked.

1515
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:39,470
'You sound very busy for the middle of the
night.'

1516
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:40,470
'Yes.

1517
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:41,770
I'm fine.

1518
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:43,900
Just sorting out some clothes for next week.

1519
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:48,480
I have a lot of things to do in the next few
days.'

1520
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,270
Ruby looked very tired and had taken off her
make-up.

1521
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:54,210
'Can I help you?'

1522
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:56,130
Nelson asked.

1523
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:57,410
Ruby laughed.

1524
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:59,720
'Of course not!

1525
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,470
What do you know about what I need to wear?

1526
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:03,910
Go to bed and get some sleep.'

1527
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:04,910
***

1528
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:11,290
At the hospice early next morning, Sister
Michael showed Nelson and Lily Anne round

1529
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:12,640
the whole place.

1530
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:18,540
Sister Michael was white and in her sixties,
with the most caring blue eyes Nelson had

1531
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:20,100
ever seen.

1532
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:25,510
There were three long low buildings in the
shade of a group of tall, dusty flamboyant

1533
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:26,640
trees.

1534
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,700
Each building had rooms with one or two beds
in.

1535
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:32,640
Most of the patients were adults.

1536
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:36,060
There were just a few rooms for children.

1537
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:42,030
Each patient had a bed, two meals and a wash
each day, and someone to take care of them.

1538
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:46,570
Everyone worked voluntarily and nobody had
to pay.

1539
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:50,900
What money the hospice had, came from the
church and as gifts.

1540
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:56,980
A very thin man was making an old door into
a bed for Blessing as they looked around.

1541
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:02,590
When they'd finished, Lily Anne took Blessing
to the bookshelves and started to read a book

1542
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:04,210
to him.

1543
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:07,460
Other children gathered round to listen.

1544
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:12,210
Once he saw the children could stay and were
settled, Nelson gave some money to Sister

1545
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:13,240
Michael.

1546
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:17,550
'Sure, you don't have to do that, you know,'
she said.

1547
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:20,090
'But it will help, won't it?'

1548
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:21,670
Nelson said with a smile.

1549
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:23,950
'Well, I won't say no.

1550
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:26,820
You're a very kind young man.'

1551
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:34,660
Nelson drove home, through miles of suburbs
that looked like Sector D. 'How many more

1552
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:39,950
orphans are there out there,' he thought,
'and how few places like the hospice?

1553
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:41,260
So little hope...'

1554
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:47,690
'And when,' he asked himself later, as he
drove up to his house, 'when am I going to

1555
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:54,420
have the courage to call Viki and ask her
to come and make another programme about them?'

1556
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:55,420
***

1557
01:28:55,420 --> 01:29:01,840
Later, in the free moments during his working
day, Nelson thought about what to say to Viki.

1558
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:06,880
He wanted a good reason for calling her: at
least better than 'I can't get you out of

1559
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:12,170
my mind although I know you couldn't care
less, so please can we meet up?'

1560
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:17,720
Finally, his work finished, and with a yellow
moon rising in front of him, he drove over

1561
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:20,370
to see Daniel.

1562
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:21,370
Daniel looked very tired.

1563
01:29:21,370 --> 01:29:26,730
He'd got a part-time job working as a singing
advertisement, outside a music shop in the

1564
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:28,580
centre of town.

1565
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:33,310
He went there three afternoons a week and
stood outside the shop with a sign saying,

1566
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:36,690
'Every song you've ever heard is on sale here!'

1567
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:42,370
His job was also to sing a few lines from
some of the most popular songs to persuade

1568
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:45,630
passers-by to come in and spend their money.

1569
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,010
For this he was paid a tiny amount.

1570
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:53,820
But at least he could give Mrs Chivasa something
towards his keep, although he had to do most

1571
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:56,140
of his school work on Sundays.

1572
01:29:56,140 --> 01:30:03,240
Daniel told Nelson about this as they sat
in Mrs Chivasa's tiny garden on her blue chairs,

1573
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:06,320
in the light of the lamp over her front door.

1574
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,420
Nelson told Daniel about Saint John's Hospice.

1575
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:14,860
'I have to thank you again and again, Nelson,'
Daniel said.

1576
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:18,460
'Now we'll be OK for a while.

1577
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:21,700
That's just incredible.'

1578
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:28,600
After a moment, he added, 'Do you know how
long they'll let Lily Anne stay at the hospice?'

1579
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:31,000
'Probably until little Blessing...'

1580
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,280
Nelson sighed.

1581
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:38,630
'You know he's going to die, don't you?'

1582
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:42,290
Daniel looked at his long thin feet and nodded
his head.

1583
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:46,420
'Then Lily Anne's going to be homeless again,'
said Nelson.

1584
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:52,750
'So I've been thinking how you can earn some
more money, and maybe you can all move back

1585
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:54,070
home.'

1586
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:57,540
'And how is that?' asked Daniel without enthusiasm.

1587
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:04,870
'I thought,' said Nelson, 'if those TV people
came back, and filmed you doing a real performance,

1588
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:09,290
then maybe people would pay you to come and
sing at parties and...'

1589
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:11,370
'Will they come back?'

1590
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:13,670
Daniel's eyes lit up.

1591
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:18,960
'Well, I could phone Phil, or the reporter
woman...'

1592
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,770
Daniel jumped up and started a gentle dance.

1593
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:24,070
He spoke to the rhythm of his dance.

1594
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:27,970
'You've seen me on TV, now you see the real
me.

1595
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:35,010
Nelson, that's so cool, better than the biggest
jewel, better than a day off school!

1596
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:41,960
People passing in the road joined in and soon
there were thirty people dancing and laughing

1597
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:45,400
in the moonlight.

1598
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,400
***

1599
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:50,460
When Nelson got home, he could hear his mother
talking on the phone in the sitting room.

1600
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:54,380
Her voice was quiet but angry.

1601
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:59,500
He would have pitied the person on the other
end, except that he guessed it was his father.

1602
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:05,740
He went upstairs to his room, where he took
a deep breath and dialled Viki's number on

1603
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:07,500
his mobile.

1604
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:10,800
He got, 'This phone is switched off.

1605
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:11,800
Please try later.'

1606
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:19,820
He sent a text message: 'News from Sector
D. Pls call.'

1607
01:32:19,820 --> 01:32:25,980
He still felt like two people, one completely
in love with Viki, and the other embarrassed

1608
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:26,980
at his own stupidity.

1609
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:31,070
'It was better she had her phone switched
off,' he thought.

1610
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:35,960
When his phone rang later, he was on the Internet.

1611
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,840
'Hello?'

1612
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,820
His voice didn't seem like his own.

1613
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,590
'Who am I speaking to?'

1614
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:48,740
Viki was bored and tired, but her voice still
made his legs go weak.

1615
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:51,470
'My name's Nelson Mbizi.

1616
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:52,560
I...

1617
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:56,980
Well, I know Daniel Mawadza, the boy who sings.'

1618
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:58,730
'Yeah.

1619
01:32:58,730 --> 01:33:00,340
So what's the news?'

1620
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:06,750
'He's made some new songs and he's now singing
at the 7th Street Shopping Mall in the afternoons,

1621
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:09,540
but the family has had to split up.

1622
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:12,560
I felt you might want to do a new piece on
him.'

1623
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,720
'Has he had an offer from a record company?'

1624
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:21,740
'Not yet, but I thought another piece on your
programme might make him a bit more well-known

1625
01:33:21,740 --> 01:33:22,740
and...'

1626
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:26,610
'Look, I work for the news department of a
TV station.

1627
01:33:26,610 --> 01:33:31,090
We're not in the business of getting every
parentless kid in Africa started with his

1628
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:32,090
music career.

1629
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:37,050
Get me some real news, and until you do, keep
off my phone!'

1630
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:38,990
'Just a minute!'

1631
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:40,900
Nelson suddenly had an idea.

1632
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:45,560
'Daniel was afraid his sister was paying for
food with sex.

1633
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:49,260
He just wants to give her a better chance.'

1634
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,500
'Say that again.'

1635
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,140
Viki's energy had returned.

1636
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:58,290
'When the family had to rent their house out
so they wouldn't starve, Daniel's sister went

1637
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:03,560
to live with a family that wanted her to pay
with sex.'

1638
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:06,210
'Where is she now?'

1639
01:34:06,210 --> 01:34:07,210
'At a church hospice.'

1640
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:08,210
'So she's safe?'

1641
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:09,670
Viki sounded almost disappointed.

1642
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:13,710
'Yes, for now, but they can't keep her forever.

1643
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:19,030
It's an AIDS hospice and she's HIV negative
- so far.'

1644
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:23,420
'The family that had her, they still around?'

1645
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:24,420
'Yes.'

1646
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:25,980
Nelson smiled to himself.

1647
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:27,380
Viki was interested.

1648
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:33,410
'Can you meet me at nine o'clock tomorrow
morning at the Lion Hills Hotel?'

1649
01:34:33,410 --> 01:34:35,290
Nelson's mouth suddenly went dry.

1650
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:36,710
'Why there?'

1651
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:40,580
'Because I'm staying there,' Viki said impatiently.

1652
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:43,070
'I just got off a plane.

1653
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:46,220
Why do you think my phone was off?'

1654
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,220
'I...

1655
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:49,730
I work at that hotel,' Nelson stammered.

1656
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:50,770
'Right.

1657
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:53,210
So it's no problem to meet in the morning?'

1658
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:54,210
'No.

1659
01:34:54,210 --> 01:34:55,880
Of course not.'

1660
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,450
Nelson could hardly breathe.

1661
01:34:57,450 --> 01:35:00,440
'You going to tell me how I'll know you?'

1662
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,440
she asked.

1663
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:02,440
'Er...

1664
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,510
I'll know you.

1665
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:06,110
My name's...'

1666
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:08,580
'Nelson Mbizi, wasn't it?

1667
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:10,350
Yeah, I remember.

1668
01:35:10,350 --> 01:35:13,200
See you in reception, nine o'clock.'

1669
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:17,810
'Bye,' he said, but she'd already hung up.

1670
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:21,180
CHAPTER NINE

1671
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:24,550
Turning point

1672
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:32,860
It was hard to concentrate on anything after
that, so Nelson went downstairs to watch TV.

1673
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:36,400
He was just getting sleepy when his mother
came into the room.

1674
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:40,240
'Could you come through and talk to your father,
Nelson?'

1675
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:41,240
she said.

1676
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:43,310
'It's midnight, Mum.

1677
01:35:43,310 --> 01:35:45,490
Is anything wrong?'

1678
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:46,950
'Just come.

1679
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:47,950
Please.'

1680
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:50,900
She had an expression on her face he'd never
seen before.

1681
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:58,010
As he followed her into the main sitting room
he realised it was controlled panic.

1682
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:02,240
His parents stood in silence on either side
of a small table.

1683
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:05,530
On it, there were a lot of papers in tidy
heaps.

1684
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:07,320
'What's wrong?'

1685
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:09,780
Nelson asked as he went in.

1686
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:12,570
His father looked up from the papers.

1687
01:36:12,570 --> 01:36:16,780
He looked ten years older and two sizes smaller.

1688
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:22,430
'I've been getting threatening phone calls
for weeks,' said Mr Mbizi, his eyes showing

1689
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:25,510
white, his voice thin with fear.

1690
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:30,160
'But today a friend warned me that someone
is trying to get rid of me completely.'

1691
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:36,290
'They say he's stolen a lot of money,' added
Ruby.

1692
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,700
Nelson stared.

1693
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:42,280
He'd guessed there was something wrong, of
course, but he'd expected it to be more personal.

1694
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:46,210
This, he knew, could mean life or death.

1695
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:51,840
'I've made arrangements to leave the country
for a short time,' his father said.

1696
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:57,320
'I hope it won't be necessary to stay away
for long, but it may be.

1697
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:01,290
Your mother doesn't want to come with me.'

1698
01:37:01,290 --> 01:37:02,290
Nelson breathed in.

1699
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:05,510
He couldn't believe what he was hearing.

1700
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:06,650
'What...

1701
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:08,500
do you want me to do?'

1702
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:11,060
'The problems are with the government.

1703
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:12,980
Business is fine.

1704
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:16,690
So I want you to stand in for me until I can
get back.'

1705
01:37:16,690 --> 01:37:17,690
'What!

1706
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:18,960
Are you sure?'

1707
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,610
Nelson stared at his father.

1708
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:24,950
'I thought you thought I'm not ready.'

1709
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:29,530
'Well, you've shown me lately that you do
have a bit of initiative.

1710
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:36,080
And anyway, you'll be more loyal than the
managers, who might steal everything the minute

1711
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,520
my back is turned.'

1712
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,900
'Oh, right,' said Nelson in surprise.

1713
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:44,020
'We've all these papers to sign,' Mr Mbizi
growled.

1714
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:49,460
'The lawyer's on her way - Mrs Murape,' said
Ruby.

1715
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:51,090
Nelson looked at her.

1716
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:52,900
'You staying then, Mum?'

1717
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:55,230
'I'm waiting for the lawyer to tell me.

1718
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:58,490
If she says it's OK, I will.

1719
01:37:58,490 --> 01:38:03,090
If not, I'll go to my cousin's in London.'

1720
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:05,880
Nelson sat down at the table with his father.

1721
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:09,660
His mind was fighting its way out of the fog
of shock.

1722
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:12,010
'When are you leaving?' he asked.

1723
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:15,720
'In about an hour,' his father answered.

1724
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,390
'An hour!'

1725
01:38:17,390 --> 01:38:22,640
Nelson shook his head to clear it and then
sat with his father making lists of things

1726
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:24,000
he would need to do.

1727
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,490
It reminded him of the checklists he'd learned
when he was studying, and that helped him

1728
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:30,870
to concentrate.

1729
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:37,040
Mrs Murape arrived and explained to Nelson
and Ruby what each was responsible for.

1730
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,330
They signed all the papers.

1731
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:43,820
Mrs Murape thought it was best for Ruby to
leave as well.

1732
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:50,360
According to the law, as his wife, Ruby could
be held responsible for any money Mr Mbizi

1733
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:54,660
supposedly owed, whereas his son could not.

1734
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:58,190
Washington assured his son that he hadn't
taken any money.

1735
01:38:58,190 --> 01:39:05,880
'There's a large sum missing from government
funds - billions - and I have enemies of course.

1736
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:10,640
So they can kill two birds with one stone
if they accuse me of taking it.

1737
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:16,350
The real thief gets away with it, they kill
the import-export bill, and I'm out of the

1738
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:21,280
way in prison - or dead and shamed.'

1739
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,950
Nelson shook his head in silent disbelief.

1740
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:31,400
Then it was time to go, so Nelson helped Ruby
and Washington down with their two small suitcases.

1741
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:37,610
He shook his father's hand and then hugged
his mother for a long time.

1742
01:39:37,610 --> 01:39:44,010
She whispered in his ear, 'We may not be back
at all, so it's all yours now.

1743
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:46,630
Take care of it.'

1744
01:39:46,630 --> 01:39:52,690
Far too soon he found himself standing at
the front door, waving goodbye to his parents,

1745
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:54,880
wondering when he would see them again.

1746
01:39:54,880 --> 01:40:00,650
His father had said to him, 'Don't let anyone
know that I've left the country.

1747
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:03,510
Just say you don't know where I am.

1748
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:05,220
Say we had a fight.

1749
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:08,710
Everyone will believe that!'

1750
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:10,240
Nobody had smiled.

1751
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:16,990
As the white gate closed behind the Mercedes,
Nelson turned back into the house and locked

1752
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:17,990
the door.

1753
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:21,610
He had never felt so alone.

1754
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:27,690
He was now responsible for hundreds of workers,
one large and two smaller hotels, a traditional

1755
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:32,280
farm in the village that his father came from
and this house.

1756
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,810
And he had no idea how long this would be
for.

1757
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:42,450
At least he knew now what all the 'only legal
son' business had been about.

1758
01:40:42,450 --> 01:40:47,040
He was grateful to his mother for protecting
his right to take over from his father, but

1759
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:52,530
it had all happened so quickly that he didn't
know where to start.

1760
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:59,650
He took all the papers and account books up
to his bedroom and began looking through them.

1761
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:00,650
***

1762
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:02,680
At five o'clock the phone in the hall rang.

1763
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:05,500
Nelson went down to answer it.

1764
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,170
It was the gate.

1765
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:10,740
There were four policemen in a truck who wanted
to speak to his father.

1766
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:14,560
Mrs Murape had warned him this might happen.

1767
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:21,330
He ran up and hid the books and papers in
his old toy box and took off his clothes.

1768
01:41:21,330 --> 01:41:24,780
He was in his nightclothes when he unlocked
the front door.

1769
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:28,230
Two of the policemen stood there with a large
dog.

1770
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:29,850
They had guns.

1771
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:32,100
'Mr Washington Mbizi?'

1772
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:34,300
the taller one said.

1773
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:40,730
'He isn't here at the moment,' Nelson answered,
trying to look as if he'd just woken up.

1774
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:42,330
'Where is he?'

1775
01:41:42,330 --> 01:41:43,930
'I'm not sure.

1776
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:47,070
He doesn't usually tell me where he's going.'

1777
01:41:47,070 --> 01:41:48,850
'When will he be back?'

1778
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:51,710
'I don't know...

1779
01:41:51,710 --> 01:41:52,710
Why do you want him?'

1780
01:41:52,710 --> 01:41:56,320
'He's been stealing money from the government.

1781
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,140
We have to search the house.'

1782
01:41:58,140 --> 01:41:59,140
'What?

1783
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:00,760
Is that allowed?

1784
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:03,120
Don't you have to have...?'

1785
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:06,830
Nelson made a gesture to stop them.

1786
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:08,390
'Just stand aside.

1787
01:42:08,390 --> 01:42:11,150
We need to know if he's here.'

1788
01:42:11,150 --> 01:42:13,040
They pushed through the door.

1789
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:17,240
One of the other men came in and stood beside
Nelson in the hallway.

1790
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:19,860
The first two and the dog checked all the
rooms.

1791
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:23,830
There were no signs of the Mbizis' packing.

1792
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:25,910
Ruby had been careful.

1793
01:42:25,910 --> 01:42:31,380
The tall policeman made a phone call asking
for all airports and borders to be watched.

1794
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:36,310
As he was leaving, he turned to Nelson and
said, 'Don't leave town.

1795
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:41,180
We'll need to talk to you again very soon.'

1796
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:45,060
CHAPTER TEN

1797
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:47,510
Viki gets to work

1798
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:52,690
When they'd gone, Nelson couldn't rest.

1799
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:54,870
Had his parents got away?

1800
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:57,340
Were they still on the road?

1801
01:42:57,340 --> 01:42:59,570
He tried to call his mother's mobile.

1802
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:01,990
It was out of range.

1803
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:08,820
He got out the papers and copied everything
he could onto his laptop computer.

1804
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:14,320
He thought he might be followed, so he put
the originals in his tennis bag and the laptop

1805
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:15,820
in a shopping bag.

1806
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:21,510
He knew he'd have to keep that with him from
now on.

1807
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:25,480
He borrowed the truck again and left for the
hotel at his usual time.

1808
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:28,400
The tennis bag was on the floor beside him.

1809
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,750
Nobody stopped him on the road.

1810
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:38,300
When he got to the hotel, he locked the tennis
bag up in the hotel strongroom.

1811
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:42,650
Fletcher didn't seem surprised that Nelson
was now his boss.

1812
01:43:42,650 --> 01:43:47,760
He said Mr Mbizi had warned him it might be
necessary for a while.

1813
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:52,270
Fletcher's calmness steadied Nelson's nerves
as they worked on the accounts together.

1814
01:43:52,270 --> 01:44:00,550
At eight fifty-five, his heartbeat shaking
his whole body, Nelson said, 'Excuse me, Fletcher.

1815
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:02,960
I have an appointment at nine.

1816
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,110
We'll go on with this later.'

1817
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:10,530
Viki was standing at reception as Nelson came
out of the lift.

1818
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:13,200
She was wearing jeans and a dark green top.

1819
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:14,630
'Good morning.

1820
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:18,390
I'm Nelson Mbizi,' he managed to say.

1821
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:21,070
'Hi,' she said, looking him up and down.

1822
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:25,170
'I want you to tell me all about Daniel's
sister...'

1823
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:31,530
The fire in her eyes held a threat, even though
she was small and only came up to his chest.

1824
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:35,550
'Let's have some breakfast,' Nelson said.

1825
01:44:35,550 --> 01:44:36,550
He felt faint.

1826
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:42,180
One half of him felt sick with wanting to
put his arms around her, the other felt angry

1827
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:44,820
at himself - and very tired.

1828
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:48,360
They ate in the restaurant on the roof.

1829
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:52,150
Viki asked about Lily Anne and wrote notes.

1830
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:56,890
She wanted to know where Lily Anne was, but
Nelson felt he should talk to Sister Michael

1831
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:58,500
before he told her.

1832
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:05,380
Viki was almost friendly, until she suddenly
asked, 'You ill or something?'

1833
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:06,720
Nelson sighed.

1834
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,740
'No, not ill.

1835
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:10,150
I've been working all night.'

1836
01:45:10,150 --> 01:45:13,820
'Well, I hope they pay you properly for that.'

1837
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:18,050
Viki took a mouthful of her breakfast and
chewed it slowly.

1838
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:19,960
Nelson watched her.

1839
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:21,840
'When do you go back to Jo'burg?'

1840
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:28,320
'I should manage to do this new story and
the one I came for in two days.'

1841
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,410
She took another mouthful.

1842
01:45:29,410 --> 01:45:35,170
'Would you like to meet me for a meal tonight,
when you finish work?'

1843
01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:36,380
'Maybe...'

1844
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:37,570
She licked her lips.

1845
01:45:37,570 --> 01:45:40,720
'Can you take me to the Black Umbrella?

1846
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:43,870
I heard it's the best place in town.'

1847
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:46,800
The Black Umbrella was very expensive.

1848
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:53,610
But suddenly Nelson remembered he was boss
of a new world, and he was making a date with

1849
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:54,960
Viki.

1850
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:57,900
'I'll see what I can do,' he said, pleased
with himself.

1851
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:04,580
'If you can afford that,' she said, her eyes
wide and innocent, 'you could afford to help

1852
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:05,580
those orphans.'

1853
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:08,630
Nelson just stared at her.

1854
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:11,800
He didn't even feel angry.

1855
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:15,690
She smiled a poisonous little smile and drank
some coffee.

1856
01:46:15,690 --> 01:46:21,720
'Come to think of it,' he said quietly after
a moment's thought, 'you're right.

1857
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:24,210
I've just been... promoted.

1858
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:27,660
So soon I should be able to help more.'

1859
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:28,660
'Why?

1860
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:31,860
Don't you have enough money now?'

1861
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:37,210
Nelson suddenly remembered that she was a
reporter and that his father's disappearance

1862
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:38,940
would be big news for her.

1863
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:42,460
He decided not to mention his father at all.

1864
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:47,150
'Not of my own,' Nelson said, looking down
at his plate.

1865
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:51,920
'So this promotion means you will have?' asked
Viki.

1866
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:52,920
'Yes.

1867
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:57,510
Now I'm taking over much more of the management
of the hotels.

1868
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:00,440
I studied that in the UK, you see.'

1869
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:01,550
'Right.'

1870
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:03,600
Viki drank some coffee.

1871
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:09,260
'And how many of your employees are HIV positive,
do you think?'

1872
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:14,940
Nelson was glad to change the subject away
from the danger of mentioning his father.

1873
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:19,120
'That's something I need to learn more about,'
he said.

1874
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:20,330
'Yeah.

1875
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:21,530
Exactly.'

1876
01:47:21,530 --> 01:47:25,000
Viki's voice had an aggressive edge.

1877
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,500
'You realise you could lose about a quarter
of your workers in the next ten years?

1878
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:35,480
You need to be training extra people to take
their places, putting money in the bank to

1879
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:36,480
help their families.'

1880
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,750
'People don't like to talk about...'

1881
01:47:38,750 --> 01:47:39,750
Nelson interrupted.

1882
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:43,660
'Very few companies realise the extent of
the problem.'

1883
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:48,420
Viki tore open a bread roll and began buttering
one half.

1884
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:50,410
'True,' Nelson said.

1885
01:47:50,410 --> 01:47:53,600
'It's something I shall certainly be researching
into.'

1886
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:58,880
He thought, 'This isn't what I want to talk
about, however right she is.'

1887
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:01,680
'Research doesn't help.'

1888
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:03,420
Viki was dismissive.

1889
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:05,360
'Telling people helps.

1890
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,420
Making it public helps.

1891
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:11,880
When it's in the papers, businesses have to
take notice.'

1892
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:13,520
Nelson felt exhausted.

1893
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:18,920
He paused while she finished her coffee, then
said, 'Would you like some more?'

1894
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:20,350
'No, that's enough.

1895
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:23,200
I'm meeting Phil in five minutes.'

1896
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:26,110
'So shall I pick you up around nine tonight?'
he asked.

1897
01:48:26,110 --> 01:48:27,110
'I usually eat earlier.

1898
01:48:27,110 --> 01:48:29,840
Can you make it seven?'

1899
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,920
'Sure.

1900
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:35,860
I'll call your room at seven.'

1901
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:39,520
She didn't speak as she turned away, just
lifted a hand.

1902
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,400
Nelson stood up politely.

1903
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:46,530
'Why do I want her?' he asked himself, feeling
sick and stupid.

1904
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:48,550
'I must be mad.'

1905
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:54,990
He arranged to see all the department managers
in the afternoon and then went home.

1906
01:48:54,990 --> 01:49:00,670
It must seem as much as possible like an ordinary
day, so he told Philomena and Cook he was

1907
01:49:00,670 --> 01:49:02,360
taking his midday break early.

1908
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:06,830
They didn't ask about his parents and he didn't
mention them.

1909
01:49:06,830 --> 01:49:09,490
He was too tired to think up explanations.

1910
01:49:09,490 --> 01:49:13,930
Anyway, the man at the gate would have been
gossiping about the cars in the night and

1911
01:49:13,930 --> 01:49:15,680
the police at dawn.

1912
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:21,290
Nelson sat down to look through the documents
on his computer, but his head sank onto the

1913
01:49:21,290 --> 01:49:25,440
desk and he slept.

1914
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,440
***

1915
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:29,620
Daniel had a visit from Viki and Phil that
afternoon at the Chivasas' house.

1916
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:36,000
They asked him about Lily Anne and the Nakulas
and where they lived, and they left to interview

1917
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,630
them without asking Daniel to join them.

1918
01:49:39,630 --> 01:49:44,920
He wondered what Viki was going to do, so
he ran along the footpaths between the houses

1919
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:49,150
and arrived at the shop just as they drove
up.

1920
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:54,110
He watched Viki and Phil get out of their
truck and walk to the shop door.

1921
01:49:54,110 --> 01:49:59,300
He stood half-hidden by a fence and saw Tobias
come out with another man.

1922
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:05,800
Viki moved the two men into the sun, and Phil
began shooting with the camera on his shoulder.

1923
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:13,410
Daniel heard Viki say, 'That was a very good
thing you did - taking in orphan children

1924
01:50:13,410 --> 01:50:15,020
- that was very kind.'

1925
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:18,150
Was her smile a little sexy?

1926
01:50:18,150 --> 01:50:21,020
Her eyes were wide and clear green.

1927
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:23,960
A small crowd gathered to watch.

1928
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:25,540
Daniel joined it.

1929
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:27,690
Tobias looked very pleased.

1930
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:32,780
'Melanie Mawadza was a good customer,' he
said with an oily smile.

1931
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:35,570
'And this gentleman is...?'

1932
01:50:35,570 --> 01:50:36,570
Viki asked.

1933
01:50:36,570 --> 01:50:39,110
'This is Arthur, my brother.

1934
01:50:39,110 --> 01:50:42,630
He has lived with us since his wife died.'

1935
01:50:42,630 --> 01:50:46,570
Tobias went on smiling, looking at the camera.

1936
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:50,710
Daniel had never seen Arthur before, only
heard of him.

1937
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:52,760
'So you are both single?'

1938
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:55,590
Viki was being warm and friendly.

1939
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:59,160
Daniel didn't recognise her as the same woman.

1940
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:01,320
'That's right.'

1941
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:03,640
Tobias turned his attention to Viki.

1942
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:08,480
And there are no other women in your house
except your mother?'

1943
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,500
'That's right.

1944
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:12,790
Mum looks after us well.'

1945
01:51:12,790 --> 01:51:16,630
Viki turned to Arthur with a sweet look in
her eyes.

1946
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:19,710
'Is Lily Anne a good child?

1947
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:24,550
Did she behave herself properly in your home?'

1948
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:28,620
Arthur's eyes were red, his skin dry and dull.

1949
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:31,830
'Well,' began Arthur with a frown.

1950
01:51:31,830 --> 01:51:34,840
But Tobias touched his arm and he smiled.

1951
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:36,510
'Yeah,' he said.

1952
01:51:36,510 --> 01:51:41,140
'But in the end, she was only here for a day.'

1953
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:43,340
Viki laughed a playful little laugh.

1954
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:47,140
'A day and a night, wasn't it?'

1955
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:48,960
Daniel moved closer.

1956
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,630
'Mmm,' Arthur went on smiling stiffly.

1957
01:51:51,630 --> 01:51:55,260
'Did she give you money for her food?'

1958
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:56,960
'Nah.

1959
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,710
We didn't want her money,' said Arthur.

1960
01:51:59,710 --> 01:52:02,100
He licked his bleeding lips slowly.

1961
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,570
'She just helped Mum.

1962
01:52:04,570 --> 01:52:08,460
We were happy to feed her and her brother
for that.'

1963
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:12,360
Viki laughed sexily again, her voice soft
and caring.

1964
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:15,870
'So there was nothing else in your agreement
with her?'

1965
01:52:15,870 --> 01:52:19,540
'She's a bit young to do anything else for
us.'

1966
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:20,540
Tobias laughed.

1967
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:24,800
Then he whispered, 'Not experienced, like
you.'

1968
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:31,120
'I thought twelve-year-olds were very attractive
to older men?

1969
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:34,210
Making love to young ones can stop AIDS, can't
it?'

1970
01:52:34,210 --> 01:52:37,590
Viki's eyes were dancing with friendly laughter.

1971
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:44,280
Tobias nodded his head and said, 'Yes, well,
we talked about it, but we decided against

1972
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:45,280
it.'

1973
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:48,920
'Did you talk to her about it?'

1974
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:53,850
Viki leaned towards them again, her voice
quiet and knowing.

1975
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:59,290
'Nah,' said Tobias, almost touching Viki as
his long tongue licked his lips.

1976
01:52:59,290 --> 01:53:01,610
'We let her sleep.'

1977
01:53:01,610 --> 01:53:05,790
Viki's voice changed to icy cold, although
she didn't move.

1978
01:53:05,790 --> 01:53:09,420
'You had some trouble with a vase, didn't
you?'

1979
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:13,730
Tobias frowned in confusion and looked at
Arthur, then Viki.

1980
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:14,730
'What?

1981
01:53:14,730 --> 01:53:16,980
What do you mean?'

1982
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:20,820
'Oh, you know very well what I mean.'

1983
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:24,040
Viki stood back and looked a question at Phil.

1984
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:25,520
He nodded.

1985
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:28,040
She turned back to the Nakula family.

1986
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:34,140
'Nothing will stop AIDS if you've got it,
Mr Nakula.

1987
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:38,130
Not medicine from the medicine man, not sex
with little girls, not eating special plants.

1988
01:53:38,130 --> 01:53:42,180
You should get your brother to hospital today!'

1989
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:45,230
She turned and walked fast to the TV truck.

1990
01:53:45,230 --> 01:53:46,970
Phil followed.

1991
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:53,130
Tobias started to shout after her, but Daniel
didn't wait to hear, and ran back to the Chivasas'

1992
01:53:53,130 --> 01:53:54,130
house.

1993
01:53:54,130 --> 01:54:00,410
And there, after some very polite chat with
Mrs Chivasa, Viki told Daniel he could sing

1994
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:01,410
again.

1995
01:54:01,410 --> 01:54:03,970
'What are you going to say about me?'

1996
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:05,570
Daniel asked Viki.

1997
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:10,850
'I'll say that sometimes you find work now,
singing in public, so that you can help pay

1998
01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:12,800
for your sister to be in a safe place.

1999
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:16,790
Then you can sing any song you like,' Viki
said.

2000
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:20,170
'Can you say I'm always looking for more work?'

2001
01:54:20,170 --> 01:54:21,170
'No, Daniel.

2002
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:24,390
This isn't an advertisement for you.

2003
01:54:24,390 --> 01:54:29,810
It's a piece of news about what happens to
some families when both parents die: the dangers,

2004
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:31,520
and how kids manage.'

2005
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:32,520
'Right.

2006
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:34,930
So a song about my mum would be OK?'

2007
01:54:34,930 --> 01:54:37,150
'If you want.

2008
01:54:37,150 --> 01:54:40,770
Or a love song might be a better one - get
you more work...'

2009
01:54:40,770 --> 01:54:43,170
She looked up at him, eyebrow raised.

2010
01:54:43,170 --> 01:54:46,740
'You're not so bad, Miss Viki,' Daniel said.

2011
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:52,840
'Shut up and get on with it,' said Viki, almost
smiling.

2012
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:56,780
So Daniel sat down under Mrs Chivasa's lemon
tree.

2013
01:54:56,780 --> 01:55:02,970
Phil turned the camera on him and Daniel said,
'This is a love song to my mother.

2014
01:55:02,970 --> 01:55:04,880
She died eighteen days ago.'

2015
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:08,360
He played a gentle tune and sang:

2016
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:11,970
Loves a light, sun through dust.

2017
01:55:11,970 --> 01:55:15,140
Keeps shining through with hope and trust.

2018
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:18,620
You're flying now and we're past the worst.

2019
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:22,410
Your body's gone, dust to dust.

2020
01:55:22,410 --> 01:55:25,590
But don't fly too far, at least, not yet.

2021
01:55:25,590 --> 01:55:27,410
Stay nearby until I get

2022
01:55:27,410 --> 01:55:30,560
A new cell phone to dial the sky,

2023
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:33,670
So we can talk instead of cry.

2024
01:55:33,670 --> 01:55:40,770
By the time he finished a small crowd had
appeared and they clapped as the last notes

2025
01:55:40,770 --> 01:55:44,210
of the mbira died away.

2026
01:55:44,210 --> 01:55:49,550
Phil turned the camera onto them and then
to Viki, who said, 'Daniel can make you laugh

2027
01:55:49,550 --> 01:55:52,050
and cry at the same time.

2028
01:55:52,050 --> 01:55:59,910
He sings to make money to pay for his sister
to live in a safe place and to buy traditional

2029
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:01,450
medicine for his little brother, who is HIV
positive.

2030
01:56:01,450 --> 01:56:05,590
The family have rented out their house to
pay for food and Daniel's school fees and

2031
01:56:05,590 --> 01:56:06,790
music lessons.

2032
01:56:06,790 --> 01:56:10,580
One day he wants to make records.

2033
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:13,160
'Daniel and his family are the lucky ones.

2034
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:16,290
They have a house and perhaps a future.

2035
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:23,090
But most orphans in Sector D, and all the
other places like it, have no hope.

2036
01:56:23,090 --> 01:56:27,930
They die because they're sick or because they
can't earn enough money to pay for food.

2037
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:31,270
Some grandmothers are caring for more than
ten children.

2038
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:36,170
Some children become thieves or sell their
bodies so they can eat.

2039
01:56:36,170 --> 01:56:37,170
They don't know where to get help.

2040
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:46,190
The medicines used in America and Europe to
fight AIDS are unavailable or too expensive.

2041
01:56:46,190 --> 01:56:51,360
'Each one of you watching this programme must
think about these children.

2042
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:57,410
AIDS is here to stay and will kill between
a quarter and a third of your family, friends

2043
01:56:57,410 --> 01:57:01,720
and colleagues here in Africa in the next
ten years.

2044
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:07,420
We all need to learn about it; how to live
our lives and help others live theirs as happily

2045
01:57:07,420 --> 01:57:10,380
as possible with this killer beside us.

2046
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:17,870
'Thank you, Daniel, for your song, and thank
you, Mrs Chivasa, for giving Daniel a happy

2047
01:57:17,870 --> 01:57:20,900
home and the chance of a future.'

2048
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:24,670
Phil nodded to Viki and turned off the camera.

2049
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:30,030
They shook Mrs Chivasa's hand and Viki walked
off.

2050
01:57:30,030 --> 01:57:34,490
Daniel asked Phil, 'Did you come because Nelson
called you?'

2051
01:57:34,490 --> 01:57:35,550
'Yeah.

2052
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:37,880
He got in touch with me, then Viki.

2053
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:41,370
They had breakfast together this morning.

2054
01:57:41,370 --> 01:57:42,620
Why?'

2055
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:47,730
Phil's eyes went to the car where Viki was
now in the driver's seat, waiting.

2056
01:57:47,730 --> 01:57:52,320
'He got my sister and brother away from the
Nakulas.

2057
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:55,920
It'd be good if you put something about him
in the film.'

2058
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:58,400
'Viki may be going to.

2059
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,780
She's having dinner with him tonight.

2060
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:03,300
I'll suggest it if I get the chance.'

2061
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:04,320
'Great.

2062
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:05,340
Thanks.

2063
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:08,790
And thanks for having me sing on TV - twice!

2064
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:10,840
Today was better...

2065
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:13,740
the first time was too soon.'

2066
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:15,510
Phil walked to the truck.

2067
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:16,510
'Yeah.

2068
01:58:16,510 --> 01:58:19,060
Keep my number!'

2069
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:20,480
'Thanks.

2070
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:21,900
Bye.'

2071
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:23,190
Daniel watched them drive off.

2072
01:58:23,190 --> 01:58:29,430
It looked as though Viki was angry with Phil
again.

2073
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:35,270
CHAPTER ELEVEN

2074
01:58:35,270 --> 01:58:36,270
First date

2075
01:58:36,270 --> 01:58:41,760
Nelson was excited and nervous that evening.

2076
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:44,330
After his morning sleep, his mind was clearer.

2077
01:58:44,330 --> 01:58:50,070
He'd had meetings with each of the department
managers to tell them about the new arrangements

2078
01:58:50,070 --> 01:58:52,300
and hear their comments.

2079
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:56,960
He'd asked his father's secretary to book
him a table for two at a very nice restaurant

2080
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:02,600
on the edge of town with tables in the garden,
fish ponds, and lamps in the trees.

2081
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:07,090
(After Viki's comment, he'd decided against
the Black Umbrella.)

2082
01:59:07,090 --> 01:59:09,360
He'd spent some more time looking at HIV charity
websites.

2083
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:17,750
He had the beginnings of an idea about how
to help the situation in Sector D, so he sent

2084
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:22,330
off some emails for information.

2085
01:59:22,330 --> 01:59:26,580
He'd also called home trying to sound normal.

2086
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:30,590
Cook said she hadn't seen his father, but
that he'd phoned.

2087
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:35,190
The message was that they'd arrived fine in
the village and they'd be back in a day or

2088
01:59:35,190 --> 01:59:36,190
two.

2089
01:59:36,190 --> 01:59:40,000
Nelson knew that meant they were safely across
the border.

2090
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:46,490
He'd relaxed a little then, but now he was
tense again as he called Viki's room.

2091
01:59:46,490 --> 01:59:48,540
'Hi, Nelson?

2092
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:50,590
Five minutes?'

2093
01:59:50,590 --> 01:59:52,400
she said, and hung up.

2094
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:58,160
He noticed his mobile battery had run out,
so he left it charging with his laptop in

2095
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:01,700
his office, locked the door and went to get
the truck.

2096
02:00:01,700 --> 02:00:05,470
He waited for Viki at the hotel door.

2097
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:10,700
She came down the steps looking perfect in
a smart brown trouser suit and crisp white

2098
02:00:10,700 --> 02:00:11,880
blouse.

2099
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:14,850
Nelson's legs went weak again.

2100
02:00:14,850 --> 02:00:18,740
'I'm glad I'm sitting down,' he thought.

2101
02:00:18,740 --> 02:00:21,850
'Did you get to Sector D?' he asked as they
drove off.

2102
02:00:21,850 --> 02:00:27,630
'I met the Nakulas and got them on film admitting
they'd been thinking about having sex with

2103
02:00:27,630 --> 02:00:28,890
Lily Anne.'

2104
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:30,720
'My God!'

2105
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,720
Nelson exclaimed.

2106
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:33,440
'How did you manage that?

2107
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,531
And what will you do with it?'

2108
02:00:34,531 --> 02:00:35,531
'Nothing.

2109
02:00:35,531 --> 02:00:36,531
I'll just show it on air.

2110
02:00:36,531 --> 02:00:45,260
It may help other girls to protect themselves,
though most people in Sector D won't see it.

2111
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:48,180
It's a good thing they didn't manage to rape
her.

2112
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:50,560
The brother, Arthur, is really sick.

2113
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:52,940
He'll be dead in a year.'

2114
02:00:52,940 --> 02:00:54,250
'How can you be sure?'

2115
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:55,690
'He's as skinny as spaghetti.

2116
02:00:55,690 --> 02:01:00,030
His lips are bleeding and he's burning up
with fever.'

2117
02:01:00,030 --> 02:01:02,550
Viki sounded disgusted.

2118
02:01:02,550 --> 02:01:07,950
After a moment, Nelson asked, 'Did Daniel
sing again?'

2119
02:01:07,950 --> 02:01:08,950
'Yeah.

2120
02:01:08,950 --> 02:01:11,830
He sang a song about his mother.'

2121
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:12,990
Her voice changed.

2122
02:01:12,990 --> 02:01:16,340
Nelson glanced across at her.

2123
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:18,360
'What's wrong, Viki?

2124
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:20,210
Wasn't he good?'

2125
02:01:20,210 --> 02:01:21,870
'Yeah, yeah.

2126
02:01:21,870 --> 02:01:22,870
Of course he was good.

2127
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:26,840
It was a very sad song, that's all.'

2128
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:28,640
She was businesslike again.

2129
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:30,080
'Have you...'

2130
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:31,510
Nelson hesitated.

2131
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:34,070
'Have you lost your mother too?'

2132
02:01:34,070 --> 02:01:35,930
'No, no.'

2133
02:01:35,930 --> 02:01:38,750
Viki laughed a tired little laugh.

2134
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:45,700
'My mum's still fine, looking after my brothers
and sisters in Soweto.'

2135
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:46,700
'So...?'

2136
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:48,020
Nelson dared to ask.

2137
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:49,970
'So nothing...'

2138
02:01:49,970 --> 02:01:51,860
She was silent for a minute.

2139
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:59,450
'Is it your job to decide on the colours in
the rooms of the hotel, because mine's a really

2140
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:00,450
sick purple?'

2141
02:02:00,450 --> 02:02:01,450
'No.

2142
02:02:01,450 --> 02:02:02,740
I only started a couple of weeks ago.'

2143
02:02:02,740 --> 02:02:05,570
'So what do you do?'

2144
02:02:05,570 --> 02:02:09,600
Nelson told her about his job as boss of three
hotels.

2145
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:11,470
He was afraid she'd ask about his father,
but she didn't.

2146
02:02:11,470 --> 02:02:18,400
At the restaurant, Viki asked to sit near
the largest fish pond.

2147
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:22,010
She wanted to be able to watch the fish swimming
in the dark water.

2148
02:02:22,010 --> 02:02:27,280
The waiter moved their table to a place on
the grass, and then lit a little lamp on it

2149
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:28,280
for them.

2150
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:30,500
'Why did you ask me to dinner?'

2151
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:33,210
Viki asked as soon as they were alone.

2152
02:02:33,210 --> 02:02:39,190
He smiled to hide his surprise, and said,
'Because you're beautiful...'

2153
02:02:39,190 --> 02:02:42,550
Viki had a 'You must be joking' expression
on her face.

2154
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:45,510
'... but you seem... troubled.

2155
02:02:45,510 --> 02:02:53,740
And,' he went on, 'you may not know many people
here, so I thought you might be alone tonight.'

2156
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:55,240
Viki laughed out loud.

2157
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:59,980
'Well, at least you said what you thought
straight out,' she said.

2158
02:02:59,980 --> 02:03:03,250
'You're very straight with everyone yourself.'

2159
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:04,250
'Yeah...'

2160
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:06,310
Viki looked at the pond.

2161
02:03:06,310 --> 02:03:09,432
There was a little pause.

2162
02:03:09,432 --> 02:03:15,400
A small waterfall played into the pond and
large, lazy goldfish caught the light.

2163
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:17,600
A waiter came to take their order.

2164
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:20,470
'What's your other story on this trip?'

2165
02:03:20,470 --> 02:03:22,290
Nelson asked when he'd gone.

2166
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:24,230
'It's about a chocolate factory.'

2167
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:27,050
'Chocolate!' he exclaimed.

2168
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:31,800
He thought, 'At least it's not disappearing
members of the government.'

2169
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:33,220
'Yes.'

2170
02:03:33,220 --> 02:03:36,010
She was gazing at the shining fish.

2171
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:42,870
She didn't explain, so Nelson said, 'Chocolate
and children orphaned by AIDS.

2172
02:03:42,870 --> 02:03:46,790
Is your work always so varied?'

2173
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:47,790
'Mmm...

2174
02:03:47,790 --> 02:03:51,830
The AIDS message is the most important.'

2175
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:52,830
'Yes.

2176
02:03:52,830 --> 02:03:54,990
AIDS has changed everyone's lives.'

2177
02:03:54,990 --> 02:03:58,120
Viki looked at him sharply.

2178
02:03:58,120 --> 02:04:00,310
'Has it changed yours?'

2179
02:04:00,310 --> 02:04:03,170
'Only to make me careful!

2180
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:04,780
But for other people it's...'

2181
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:07,010
'A life or death business.'

2182
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:10,820
Viki's voice was hard.

2183
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:12,580
She was looking at the tablecloth.

2184
02:04:12,580 --> 02:04:16,390
'Have you lost someone lately?'

2185
02:04:16,390 --> 02:04:17,650
Nelson asked gently.

2186
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:18,730
'Not yet.

2187
02:04:18,730 --> 02:04:22,530
But it's only a matter of time.'

2188
02:04:22,530 --> 02:04:24,790
Viki looked up at him again.

2189
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:27,490
'Do you want to talk about it?'

2190
02:04:27,490 --> 02:04:28,790
'Not really...

2191
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:33,900
What I do want is to make as much noise as
I can.

2192
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:38,460
It's good I have a job where I can make some
things more well-known.

2193
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:39,540
So that's what I do.

2194
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:44,940
I tell the world about AIDS as it is, not
all the stories and lies.'

2195
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:53,240
'I've been thinking,' Nelson said, 'about
what you said - about those kids and a better

2196
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:54,240
place to live.'

2197
02:04:54,240 --> 02:04:55,240
'Yeah.

2198
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:57,260
You're a rich man.

2199
02:04:57,260 --> 02:04:59,470
You could do a lot for them.'

2200
02:04:59,470 --> 02:05:01,330
'Yes, maybe I could.

2201
02:05:01,330 --> 02:05:07,110
I haven't got much spare time just now, but
I'm beginning to think that those people in

2202
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:13,440
Sector D need a place to go, a kind of...
a kind of AIDS centre.'

2203
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:15,830
'What would they do there?'

2204
02:05:15,830 --> 02:05:17,420
Viki spoke sharply.

2205
02:05:17,420 --> 02:05:21,670
'Talk about it, learn about it, get tested...'

2206
02:05:21,670 --> 02:05:22,670
'Ha!

2207
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:26,670
They'd never even go in the door.'

2208
02:05:26,670 --> 02:05:29,150
Viki seemed suddenly angrier than ever.

2209
02:05:29,150 --> 02:05:31,990
'Nobody wants to know about AIDS.

2210
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:34,720
They just want to pretend it doesn't exist.

2211
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:41,620
People who are dying now, this minute, bleeding
and coughing to death, even they don't want

2212
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:44,260
to know what they've got.'

2213
02:05:44,260 --> 02:05:45,630
'Perhaps...'

2214
02:05:45,630 --> 02:05:47,400
Nelson decided not to argue.

2215
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:50,350
The waiter brought their food.

2216
02:05:50,350 --> 02:05:58,160
'What you really need,' Viki said a few moments
later, 'is a programme in schools to tell

2217
02:05:58,160 --> 02:05:59,640
the kids the truth.

2218
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:04,600
And a government programme that tests everyone
for free and gives advice.

2219
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:12,199
Then everyone who's HIV positive should get
those drugs that slow it down - anti-retrovirals

2220
02:06:12,199 --> 02:06:14,030
- for free as well.'

2221
02:06:14,030 --> 02:06:15,800
'Yes, I know.

2222
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:16,800
ARVs.

2223
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:20,261
But can you imagine any government in Africa
doing that?

2224
02:06:20,261 --> 02:06:21,261
Any government in the world, even?'

2225
02:06:21,261 --> 02:06:22,261
'That's what it needs, though.

2226
02:06:22,261 --> 02:06:29,540
And in some places they are doing at least
some of those things.'

2227
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:33,880
'But what about people who have AIDS now?'

2228
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:36,300
Nelson thought of little Blessing.

2229
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:39,110
'They need state help too.

2230
02:06:39,110 --> 02:06:42,770
You've got to care for the dying and orphans
as well.'

2231
02:06:42,770 --> 02:06:44,190
'The sick are sick.

2232
02:06:44,190 --> 02:06:46,630
They aren't going to get better.

2233
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:50,310
Just give them ARVs and let them die when
their time comes.

2234
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:57,440
But to stop HIV spreading we must spend the
money on making sure they don't infect anyone

2235
02:06:57,440 --> 02:06:58,440
else.'

2236
02:06:58,440 --> 02:06:59,840
'How can you say that?'

2237
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,340
Nelson was horrified.

2238
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:05,220
'Even some animals take care of their dying
relatives.'

2239
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:10,832
'Not if they have to choose between the dying
and the living.

2240
02:07:10,832 --> 02:07:16,132
And that's what we humans have to do now.

2241
02:07:16,132 --> 02:07:19,780
There just isn't enough money to care for
those who have no future and to make sure

2242
02:07:19,780 --> 02:07:23,460
everyone else has a future.'

2243
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:25,010
Nelson was silent.

2244
02:07:25,010 --> 02:07:30,840
Viki was getting more angry by the minute,
and he didn't want to have a real fight with

2245
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:31,920
her.

2246
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:38,200
'People who test positive these days have
to learn to look after themselves,' she went

2247
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:39,200
on.

2248
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:42,630
There was a pause.

2249
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:46,460
'Shall we try talking about something else?'
he asked.

2250
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:47,460
'Sorry?'

2251
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:51,900
'You were the one who said I was rich enough
to help Daniel's family.

2252
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:58,520
And when I talk about doing just that, you
get really angry, as though I was wrong.

2253
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:02,270
So I thought we should talk about something
that doesn't make you angry.'

2254
02:08:02,270 --> 02:08:05,690
'I didn't say you're wrong to help them.

2255
02:08:05,690 --> 02:08:09,840
Except for Blessing, they're still OK.

2256
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:11,210
They do have a future.

2257
02:08:11,210 --> 02:08:17,160
But it's not enough just to give them food
and get them back home.

2258
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:21,740
They need telling again and again how to avoid
getting sick.

2259
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:24,360
Nobody does that.'

2260
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:28,010
'Except you, you mean?'

2261
02:08:28,010 --> 02:08:30,340
Nelson smiled.

2262
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:33,600
'Nobody else in this whole world is trying
to get that message across.'

2263
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:38,040
Viki looked at him as if he were five years
old.

2264
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:39,960
'There are others.

2265
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:45,210
But not enough, and not in the right places.'

2266
02:08:45,210 --> 02:08:46,210
'Right.

2267
02:08:46,210 --> 02:08:47,210
OK...'

2268
02:08:47,210 --> 02:08:51,970
Perhaps she was like his mother, and couldn't
accept other people's opinions.

2269
02:08:51,970 --> 02:08:58,340
He smiled again and said, 'Now we are going
to talk about something else.'

2270
02:08:58,340 --> 02:08:59,840
'Like what?'

2271
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:03,090
Her voice gave him no encouragement.

2272
02:09:03,090 --> 02:09:07,490
'Like why you agreed to come out to dinner
with me.'

2273
02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:09,840
Viki looked up from her plate.

2274
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:13,490
It was as if she was seeing him for the first
time.

2275
02:09:13,490 --> 02:09:15,210
'God knows!'

2276
02:09:15,210 --> 02:09:16,380
she said.

2277
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:19,770
Nelson felt a real pain in his chest.

2278
02:09:19,770 --> 02:09:22,060
'Well... thanks.'

2279
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:24,350
'You're welcome.'

2280
02:09:24,350 --> 02:09:26,720
He thought, 'So...

2281
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:29,260
This really isn't going to work.

2282
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:31,240
She doesn't like me at all.'

2283
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:35,990
He ate some more of his suddenly tasteless
food.

2284
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:40,040
'Maybe she just thinks I'm useful to her in
some way.

2285
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:43,570
But then at least she would be polite...

2286
02:09:43,570 --> 02:09:47,450
So what is wrong between us?'

2287
02:09:47,450 --> 02:09:53,690
He was quiet a long time, trying to accept
the pain and forget that his body wanted hers.

2288
02:09:53,690 --> 02:09:59,620
At last he said, 'There is one thing I want
to ask you.'

2289
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:02,780
Viki was finishing the last of her food with
a slight frown.

2290
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:03,780
'Mmm?'

2291
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:09,220
'Are there any centres in Soweto for people
with HIV and AIDS - like I mentioned?

2292
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:13,990
Somewhere to go and learn what to do and meet
other people with the same problems?'

2293
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:15,820
'Not in my area.

2294
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:19,910
I think I've heard of one further away.

2295
02:10:19,910 --> 02:10:23,780
But people are embarrassed to be seen going
there.'

2296
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:24,960
Viki sighed.

2297
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:29,920
'That's so stupid, but it's the way things
are.'

2298
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:33,740
'So you don't advise me to do anything like
that?'

2299
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:36,960
'Why should I advise you to do anything?'

2300
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:41,231
'Well, you know more people with AIDS than
I do.'

2301
02:10:41,231 --> 02:10:43,830
'What do you mean?'

2302
02:10:43,830 --> 02:10:45,170
She was angry again.

2303
02:10:45,170 --> 02:10:49,270
'I've just met the people I make reports about.'

2304
02:10:49,270 --> 02:10:51,790
'Well, that's more than I have.'

2305
02:10:51,790 --> 02:10:54,450
Viki looked at her watch.

2306
02:10:54,450 --> 02:10:55,450
'Look.

2307
02:10:55,450 --> 02:10:58,160
Can we leave soon?'

2308
02:10:58,160 --> 02:10:59,650
'Yes, I...

2309
02:10:59,650 --> 02:11:00,650
Of course.'

2310
02:11:00,650 --> 02:11:04,390
'I'll just go to the toilet.'

2311
02:11:04,390 --> 02:11:05,390
'Sure...'

2312
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:08,670
Nelson stood up as Viki left the table.

2313
02:11:08,670 --> 02:11:12,310
He sat down again and watched the lights on
the water.

2314
02:11:12,310 --> 02:11:16,990
When she got back, he'd paid the bill and
they left immediately.

2315
02:11:16,990 --> 02:11:20,180
Viki was silent.

2316
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:22,210
Nelson was trying to think.

2317
02:11:22,210 --> 02:11:28,280
She obviously wasn't interested in him, not
for himself or even for his money.

2318
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:31,030
It was as if she'd locked a door against him.

2319
02:11:31,030 --> 02:11:37,270
Getting out of the truck, she said, 'It was
a good meal.'

2320
02:11:37,270 --> 02:11:39,030
His voice had an edge.

2321
02:11:39,030 --> 02:11:40,480
'Thanks for eating it with me.'

2322
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:41,480
'No problem.'

2323
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:45,750
'Tell me something, Viki.'

2324
02:11:45,750 --> 02:11:48,150
She stopped on the steps and turned round.

2325
02:11:48,150 --> 02:11:49,150
'Yeah?'

2326
02:11:49,150 --> 02:11:56,270
'Why does a beautiful, intelligent girl like
you enjoy hating so much?'

2327
02:11:56,270 --> 02:11:59,610
Viki's mouth and eyes opened in surprise.

2328
02:11:59,610 --> 02:12:03,080
She turned and ran up the steps without answering.

2329
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:07,050
Nelson sat in the truck for a few moments.

2330
02:12:07,050 --> 02:12:11,010
The angry, painful fog in his head suddenly
cleared.

2331
02:12:11,010 --> 02:12:13,240
'Right,' he thought.

2332
02:12:13,240 --> 02:12:15,260
'That's over.

2333
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:16,270
Finished.

2334
02:12:16,270 --> 02:12:18,140
Forget her.'

2335
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:24,530
He got out of the truck, threw the keys to
the doorman and started up the steps himself.

2336
02:12:24,530 --> 02:12:29,250
Suddenly he felt his arms being held from
behind and a voice in his ear said, 'Come

2337
02:12:29,250 --> 02:12:32,120
with us, please, Mr Mbizi.

2338
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:37,010
You're under arrest.'

2339
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:40,320
CHAPTER TWELVE

2340
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,540
Where's your father?

2341
02:12:41,540 --> 02:12:49,110
Nelson was dragged into a waiting van and
found himself lying in complete darkness on

2342
02:12:49,110 --> 02:12:50,920
the metal floor.

2343
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:54,420
He rolled from side to side as the van raced
along.

2344
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:58,810
His head hit against something and he lost
consciousness.

2345
02:12:58,810 --> 02:13:04,130
When he came round, he was on a hard bed in
a cell.

2346
02:13:04,130 --> 02:13:07,360
There was a bucket in the corner as a toilet.

2347
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:12,090
There was another man asleep and snoring on
the other bed.

2348
02:13:12,090 --> 02:13:16,990
The place was disgusting and smelled of dirt
and alcohol.

2349
02:13:16,990 --> 02:13:23,570
A man with keys came and took Nelson to a
room with two chairs with a desk between.

2350
02:13:23,570 --> 02:13:30,190
'Sit there and don't move, otherwise we'll
have to tie you up,' said the man.

2351
02:13:30,190 --> 02:13:32,330
He went out and locked the door.

2352
02:13:32,330 --> 02:13:38,470
Nelson's head was aching, but his mind was
working.

2353
02:13:38,470 --> 02:13:41,450
This must be to do with his father.

2354
02:13:41,450 --> 02:13:45,150
His heart beat with fear as he heard the key
in the door.

2355
02:13:45,150 --> 02:13:52,620
A tall man wearing a black leather jacket
came in and sat down opposite Nelson.

2356
02:13:52,620 --> 02:13:58,760
'Nelson Mbizi,' said the man, and just looked
at Nelson.

2357
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:01,050
Nelson acted stupid.

2358
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:04,270
'Yes?' he said pleasantly.

2359
02:14:04,270 --> 02:14:08,240
'Where's your father?' asked the man.

2360
02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:14,260
He had a pair of sunglasses and was polishing
them on his black shirt.

2361
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:19,740
The sunglasses showed he wasn't an ordinary
policeman.

2362
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:23,940
He was from the secret police of the Intelligence
Agency.

2363
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:32,440
'I had a message that he was in the village,
so he'll probably be back in a day or two.'

2364
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:38,020
Nelson tried to relax, although his head ached
and his heart was racing.

2365
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:42,480
'He's not in the village,' said the man.

2366
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:44,700
Nelson looked surprised.

2367
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:50,730
'Then I don't know where he is,' he said worriedly.

2368
02:14:50,730 --> 02:14:53,900
'Where's your father?'

2369
02:14:53,900 --> 02:14:55,790
the man said again.

2370
02:14:55,790 --> 02:15:01,810
'If he's not in the village, I don't know,'
Nelson said.

2371
02:15:01,810 --> 02:15:04,920
'Where's your father?'

2372
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:07,900
the man said a third time.

2373
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:10,670
'Look, I don't know.

2374
02:15:10,670 --> 02:15:13,220
I thought he was in the village.'

2375
02:15:13,220 --> 02:15:17,990
Nelson was glad he really didn't know where
his father was.

2376
02:15:17,990 --> 02:15:23,250
The man stood up and put on a pair of black
leather gloves.

2377
02:15:23,250 --> 02:15:27,070
'You know,' he stated.

2378
02:15:27,070 --> 02:15:31,900
Nelson stood up too, expecting to be hit.

2379
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:34,060
'I really don't know.

2380
02:15:34,060 --> 02:15:37,520
I've been out of the country for three years.

2381
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:41,380
I got back less than three weeks ago.

2382
02:15:41,380 --> 02:15:47,240
I have no idea what you're trying to find
out or why you want my father.'

2383
02:15:47,240 --> 02:15:52,260
The man stared into Nelson's face for what
felt like an hour.

2384
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:56,360
Then he turned and left the room, banging
the door.

2385
02:15:56,360 --> 02:15:59,910
Nelson sat down, feeling quite sick.

2386
02:15:59,910 --> 02:16:02,580
The door opened again.

2387
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:08,070
A different man took Nelson by the arm and
led him back towards the cell.

2388
02:16:08,070 --> 02:16:12,800
Nelson said, 'Look, you... you can't hold
me here.

2389
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,550
I haven't done anything wrong.

2390
02:16:14,550 --> 02:16:17,020
I want to speak to my lawyer.'

2391
02:16:17,020 --> 02:16:23,480
'In the morning,' this man said, and pushed
Nelson back into the cell and locked the door.

2392
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:26,920
Nelson lost his temper.

2393
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:29,900
He shook the door, but nothing happened.

2394
02:16:29,900 --> 02:16:32,840
He walked up and down shouting.

2395
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:34,519
The other man slept on.

2396
02:16:34,519 --> 02:16:39,050
In the end, Nelson sat on the bed, exhausted.

2397
02:16:39,050 --> 02:16:42,120
'The worst day of my life,' he thought.

2398
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:47,990
'If I get out of this alive, I'll never have
anything to do with politics.

2399
02:16:47,990 --> 02:16:53,450
I'll get that AIDS centre started - and I'll
forget all about Viki.'

2400
02:16:53,450 --> 02:17:01,120
Nelson had eventually dropped off to sleep
and woke curled up on the hard bed.

2401
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:04,530
Two policemen were taking the other man out
of the cell.

2402
02:17:04,530 --> 02:17:09,110
He had to be held up, he was still so drunk.

2403
02:17:09,110 --> 02:17:11,260
Nelson followed them out.

2404
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:18,000
'No, you stay in there,' said one of the policemen,
trying to push him back while keeping the

2405
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,290
other man up.

2406
02:17:19,290 --> 02:17:23,390
'I want to see my lawyer,' said Nelson.

2407
02:17:23,390 --> 02:17:29,250
It seemed that the man with the sunglasses
hadn't left any orders about what to do with

2408
02:17:29,250 --> 02:17:30,340
Nelson.

2409
02:17:30,340 --> 02:17:36,280
So Nelson signed a piece of paper and walked
out into the early sunshine, trying not to

2410
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:38,019
show how relieved he was.

2411
02:17:38,019 --> 02:17:41,769
He took a taxi to the hotel.

2412
02:17:41,769 --> 02:17:46,300
He told Fletcher what had happened and arranged
to be off for the rest of the day.

2413
02:17:46,300 --> 02:17:51,421
He collected his mobile and laptop and went
home.

2414
02:17:51,421 --> 02:17:54,190
Philomena and Cook were very excited.

2415
02:17:54,190 --> 02:17:59,050
A group of men from the Intelligence Agency
had been there from early morning until a

2416
02:17:59,050 --> 02:18:01,631
few minutes before.

2417
02:18:01,631 --> 02:18:07,000
Cook guessed they'd been setting up microphones,
bugging the house.

2418
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:12,190
Nelson was too tired to do anything about
that, or to tell them much about his arrest.

2419
02:18:12,190 --> 02:18:17,800
'They seem to be concerned about Mum and Dad
being away.

2420
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:23,219
We'll just have to remember the bugs when
we talk to each other - and on the phone!'

2421
02:18:23,219 --> 02:18:25,180
he said.

2422
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:27,809
He went up to bed and slept.

2423
02:18:27,809 --> 02:18:31,980
He woke in the early afternoon and checked
his emails.

2424
02:18:31,980 --> 02:18:37,690
There was a very positive response from one
large international charity.

2425
02:18:37,690 --> 02:18:42,130
It said there could be funding of several
thousand dollars if he prepared a business

2426
02:18:42,130 --> 02:18:45,639
plan and had it approved by a bank and a lawyer.

2427
02:18:45,639 --> 02:18:49,490
There was even an example business plan for
him to work from.

2428
02:18:49,490 --> 02:18:53,599
He ran downstairs to find some food.

2429
02:18:53,599 --> 02:18:58,290
Suddenly things didn't seem so bad - and he
was starving!

2430
02:18:58,290 --> 02:19:03,130
As he was finishing his food, the afternoon
newspaper came.

2431
02:19:03,130 --> 02:19:09,179
The story about his father supposedly stealing
government funds and making a run for it was

2432
02:19:09,179 --> 02:19:12,590
all over the front page, including his own
arrest.

2433
02:19:12,590 --> 02:19:17,769
The paper did at least suggest that Mr Mbizi
was being victimised.

2434
02:19:17,769 --> 02:19:23,170
It said that the new import-export laws he'd
been working on would have meant some people

2435
02:19:23,170 --> 02:19:25,350
would lose a lot of money.

2436
02:19:25,350 --> 02:19:31,410
Nelson left the paper for Philomena and Cook
and the gardener to read, and drove to Sector

2437
02:19:31,410 --> 02:19:34,130
D.

2438
02:19:34,130 --> 02:19:35,130
***

2439
02:19:35,130 --> 02:19:40,849
Primrose Chivasa was tidying up after feeding
Daniel, Givemore and nine other hungry, noisy

2440
02:19:40,849 --> 02:19:46,280
children, when she heard Nelson's truck and
then his 'Knock, knock!'

2441
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:47,280
Silence fell.

2442
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:50,220
'Come in, Mr Nelson,' she called.

2443
02:19:50,220 --> 02:19:56,970
After greeting everyone, Nelson asked Primrose,
'Do you know of anywhere for rent that would

2444
02:19:56,970 --> 02:20:00,970
be big enough for a sort of club or restaurant?'

2445
02:20:00,970 --> 02:20:05,340
'Goodness... that's a strange question, Mr
Nelson.'

2446
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:06,340
Nelson laughed.

2447
02:20:06,340 --> 02:20:10,830
'Yes, I know - and please just call me Nelson.

2448
02:20:10,830 --> 02:20:15,490
I want to see what the costs would be for
an idea I've had.'

2449
02:20:15,490 --> 02:20:19,500
Twelve pairs of eyes demanded an explanation.

2450
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:22,090
Nelson laughed again.

2451
02:20:22,090 --> 02:20:28,070
'Well, I hope to be able to start what they
call a drop-in centre for young people in

2452
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:33,240
Sector D. It would have a cafe and music so
you could meet your friends.

2453
02:20:33,240 --> 02:20:37,960
But it would also have an office where you
could get advice on living in a community

2454
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:42,700
with HIV and, I hope, a small laboratory where
you could be tested.'

2455
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:45,980
There was silence.

2456
02:20:45,980 --> 02:20:51,400
This wasn't something people talked much about
in public, in front of children.

2457
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:53,830
People were too afraid of HIV and AIDS.

2458
02:20:53,830 --> 02:21:01,170
They felt helpless and hopeless, so it was
spoken of behind hands, in whispers.

2459
02:21:01,170 --> 02:21:02,530
Nelson looked round the room.

2460
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:03,860
'What do you think?'

2461
02:21:03,860 --> 02:21:11,300
Givemore asked, 'Would there be somewhere
for a basketball ring?' and everyone laughed.

2462
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:16,311
'We could make sure there was,' replied Nelson.

2463
02:21:16,311 --> 02:21:21,890
Daniel said quietly, 'If it was a place that
people went to anyway to have fun, just a

2464
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:26,840
kind of social club, I think people would
go, even with the laboratory.

2465
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:29,330
We don't have a place like that near here.

2466
02:21:29,330 --> 02:21:31,890
But it would have to be cheap!'

2467
02:21:31,890 --> 02:21:34,530
Nelson looked at Mrs Chivasa.

2468
02:21:34,530 --> 02:21:39,220
'People would be embarrassed about the testing
and advice centre?'

2469
02:21:39,220 --> 02:21:42,070
'Yes,' she said with emphasis.

2470
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:44,380
'Right,' said Nelson.

2471
02:21:44,380 --> 02:21:50,580
'So is there anywhere in Sector D we could
rent to be a social club with coffee and music...'

2472
02:21:50,580 --> 02:21:53,511
'And room to dance,' laughed Daniel.

2473
02:21:53,511 --> 02:21:56,700
'And for football,' shouted a smaller boy.

2474
02:21:56,700 --> 02:22:02,630
A man's deep voice from the door said quietly,
'I know of somewhere.'

2475
02:22:02,630 --> 02:22:04,330
Everyone turned.

2476
02:22:04,330 --> 02:22:09,370
It was Mr Chivasa, home from work, with a
newspaper under his arm.

2477
02:22:09,370 --> 02:22:15,550
'I see you've been having adventures, young
man,' he said to Nelson as he came in and

2478
02:22:15,550 --> 02:22:17,990
put the paper on a shelf.

2479
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:21,761
Nelson touched the bruise on his head and
smiled.

2480
02:22:21,761 --> 02:22:23,910
The two men shook hands.

2481
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:30,680
'Well,' went on Mr Chivasa, 'when I've eaten,
I'll show you the place I've seen.

2482
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:34,000
It's an old bus garage by the river.'

2483
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,330
Primrose Chivasa was disgusted.

2484
02:22:36,330 --> 02:22:39,890
'But that's a horrible place.

2485
02:22:39,890 --> 02:22:43,620
It's much too dirty, and the river sometimes
comes right up to it in the rains.'

2486
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:49,130
'But it would be cheap,' laughed Mr Chivasa.

2487
02:22:49,130 --> 02:22:55,460
When Nelson, Givemore, Daniel and Mr Chivasa
got to the old garage a short time later,

2488
02:22:55,460 --> 02:22:59,170
they saw that Primrose had been right about
it being dirty.

2489
02:22:59,170 --> 02:23:04,951
But it had a large yard shaded by a great
flamboyant tree just coming into leaf, and

2490
02:23:04,951 --> 02:23:08,130
the river wasn't as close as she'd remembered.

2491
02:23:08,130 --> 02:23:14,450
'With a lot of work and a little money, this
could be a really good place,' Nelson said

2492
02:23:14,450 --> 02:23:16,040
after they'd looked around.

2493
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:21,160
'The roof seems fine and the walls are strong,'
Mr Chivasa agreed.

2494
02:23:21,160 --> 02:23:22,160
'Yeah!'

2495
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:23,160
shouted Givemore.

2496
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:30,410
'You could have the basketball ring there,
and the tables inside, and out here...'

2497
02:23:30,410 --> 02:23:33,450
'Sure,' agreed Nelson.

2498
02:23:33,450 --> 02:23:38,420
'And in the back part of the building, with
a door from the other side, people could come

2499
02:23:38,420 --> 02:23:40,500
to see the nurse, be tested, get advice, and
so on.'

2500
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:46,560
They stood outside, looking at the thin line
of water running in the sandy riverbed.

2501
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:53,240
The river was full of rubbish and there were
paths over the sand where people crossed it.

2502
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:57,620
When the rains came the paths and the rubbish
would all be washed away.

2503
02:23:57,620 --> 02:24:02,840
Givemore ran down into the riverbed to get
a football he could see among the rubbish.

2504
02:24:02,840 --> 02:24:06,370
Mr Chivasa followed him.

2505
02:24:06,370 --> 02:24:07,450
Daniel turned to Nelson.

2506
02:24:07,450 --> 02:24:11,110
'Did you and Miss Viki have a good time last
night?'

2507
02:24:11,110 --> 02:24:13,980
'What do you know about that, Daniel?'

2508
02:24:13,980 --> 02:24:14,980
Nelson asked.

2509
02:24:14,980 --> 02:24:17,800
'Phil said you'd be meeting up.'

2510
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:20,540
'Well, we did meet.

2511
02:24:20,540 --> 02:24:22,740
But we didn't become friends.

2512
02:24:22,740 --> 02:24:25,420
She really seems to enjoy hurting people.'

2513
02:24:25,420 --> 02:24:27,910
'That's sad,' said Daniel.

2514
02:24:27,910 --> 02:24:32,320
'You can't stay in love with someone like
that.'

2515
02:24:32,320 --> 02:24:33,700
Nelson laughed falsely.

2516
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:35,480
'What makes you say that?'

2517
02:24:35,480 --> 02:24:36,940
'It's obvious.

2518
02:24:36,940 --> 02:24:39,530
Love shines, you know, but...'

2519
02:24:39,530 --> 02:24:45,090
'Well, if I was in love with her before, I'm
not now!'

2520
02:24:45,090 --> 02:24:47,250
Daniel looked at Nelson.

2521
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:48,250
'No.

2522
02:24:48,250 --> 02:24:52,050
Of course not,' he said.

2523
02:24:52,050 --> 02:24:55,260
Givemore and his father were coming back up
from the riverbed with the football.

2524
02:24:55,260 --> 02:24:57,360
'It's got a hole in it.

2525
02:24:57,360 --> 02:24:59,630
But Dad says he can fix it!'

2526
02:24:59,630 --> 02:25:00,630
Givemore shouted.

2527
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:05,050
'Some things can't be mended,' Nelson called
back.

2528
02:25:05,050 --> 02:25:09,160
'It depends on what you want them to do,'
said Daniel.

2529
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:16,090
As they walked back, Nelson asked Mr Chivasa,
'If people knew there was some help available,

2530
02:25:16,090 --> 02:25:22,490
if they knew there was some hope, would they
feel better about being seen going for blood

2531
02:25:22,490 --> 02:25:23,490
tests?'

2532
02:25:23,490 --> 02:25:26,920
Mr Chivasa thought for a moment.

2533
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:30,510
'It's partly because sex is involved.

2534
02:25:30,510 --> 02:25:35,801
People are shy about their sex lives and don't
want to do anything in public that indicates

2535
02:25:35,801 --> 02:25:37,180
what they do in private.'

2536
02:25:37,180 --> 02:25:42,050
Nelson remembered something Viki had said.

2537
02:25:42,050 --> 02:25:48,300
'It would be good if everyone who came to
the centre was given advice and was tested,

2538
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:51,370
not just those who were worried about being
HIV positive.

2539
02:25:51,370 --> 02:25:57,370
We could make this clear to the customers,
then there'd be no reason for that shyness,

2540
02:25:57,370 --> 02:25:58,811
would there?

2541
02:25:58,811 --> 02:26:01,670
Everyone would be the same.'

2542
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:03,351
Daniel was just behind them.

2543
02:26:03,351 --> 02:26:09,940
He put in, 'You mean everyone who comes to
the cafe at the centre - as a kind of condition

2544
02:26:09,940 --> 02:26:13,040
of being allowed to use the centre?'

2545
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:15,140
'No, no.

2546
02:26:15,140 --> 02:26:22,750
Just if they want to, but make it kind of...
fashionable, the thing to do,' Nelson said

2547
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:24,660
over his shoulder.

2548
02:26:24,660 --> 02:26:30,650
Mr Chivasa said, 'If they liked the centre
enough, it might work.

2549
02:26:30,650 --> 02:26:35,230
You could give them a free meal if they agreed
to a test and a chat!'

2550
02:26:35,230 --> 02:26:39,890
They arrived at Nelson's truck and the two
men shook hands again.

2551
02:26:39,890 --> 02:26:43,580
'Best of luck, Nelson Mbizi,' sang Daniel.

2552
02:26:43,580 --> 02:26:46,511
'But you know, it won't be eazy!'

2553
02:26:46,511 --> 02:26:49,250
Nelson drove away with a smile.

2554
02:26:49,250 --> 02:26:50,250
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

2555
02:26:50,250 --> 02:26:51,861
Business plan

2556
02:26:51,861 --> 02:27:00,221
The next evening, Nelson left the hotel early
to have time to go to the old garage and get

2557
02:27:00,221 --> 02:27:02,061
measurements for his business plan.

2558
02:27:02,061 --> 02:27:06,970
He'd had no further news from his parents.

2559
02:27:06,970 --> 02:27:12,550
He'd also noticed he was being followed by
a small black car, but he tried to act naturally

2560
02:27:12,550 --> 02:27:13,550
anyway.

2561
02:27:13,550 --> 02:27:20,500
Nothing he did was going to help anyone find
his father.

2562
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:25,150
Nelson drove up to the Chivasas' house when
he'd finished and found that Daniel was just

2563
02:27:25,150 --> 02:27:27,900
back from singing in the shopping mall.

2564
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:32,010
'Have you got time to come with me to visit
Sister Michael at the hospice?'

2565
02:27:32,010 --> 02:27:33,270
Nelson asked him.

2566
02:27:33,270 --> 02:27:35,330
Daniel's face lit up.

2567
02:27:35,330 --> 02:27:36,360
'Oh yeah!

2568
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:44,271
Gotta see my sis at the hospice, make sure
Blessings not been messing, and give the Sister

2569
02:27:44,271 --> 02:27:45,271
some money.

2570
02:27:45,271 --> 02:27:46,271
Thanks, Nelson.

2571
02:27:46,271 --> 02:27:47,851
There's no direct bus.

2572
02:27:47,851 --> 02:27:50,510
Going in your truck would be great!'

2573
02:27:50,510 --> 02:27:56,650
They drove over to the hospice with Daniel
singing all the way.

2574
02:27:56,650 --> 02:28:02,340
He especially liked Kundai Kambera's songs,
and Nelson had to ask him to sing something

2575
02:28:02,340 --> 02:28:05,271
else when he'd sung the same one three times.

2576
02:28:05,271 --> 02:28:11,670
Nelson also said he didn't need to pay for
Blessing's care, but Daniel insisted he wanted

2577
02:28:11,670 --> 02:28:12,670
to.

2578
02:28:12,670 --> 02:28:16,690
By the time they drove into the hospice yard
it was dark.

2579
02:28:16,690 --> 02:28:20,730
Nelson got out and said, 'Just a minute,'
to Daniel.

2580
02:28:20,730 --> 02:28:26,181
He wanted to check out the black car that
was now parked outside the gate.

2581
02:28:26,181 --> 02:28:29,340
A white lady was walking towards the truck.

2582
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:32,330
Daniel held out his hand to her.

2583
02:28:32,330 --> 02:28:35,300
'You must be Sister Michael.'

2584
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:37,080
'Indeed, I am.

2585
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:41,590
And I would say you're Lily Anne's big brother.'

2586
02:28:41,590 --> 02:28:43,570
She smiled, shaking his hand.

2587
02:28:43,570 --> 02:28:44,820
Daniel towered over her.

2588
02:28:44,820 --> 02:28:45,860
'I'm Daniel.

2589
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:48,470
Our big brother is Eddy.

2590
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:52,220
I want to thank you, Sister Michael...'

2591
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:58,610
'It's I who should be thanking you, Daniel.

2592
02:28:58,610 --> 02:29:01,810
Lily Anne's a darling.

2593
02:29:01,810 --> 02:29:06,290
She's forever looking for ways to help, reading
to our guests, cleaning, cooking...'

2594
02:29:06,290 --> 02:29:08,510
'She kept our mother alive for much longer
than we boys could have,' said Daniel.

2595
02:29:08,510 --> 02:29:13,040
'But nothing is going to keep little Blessing
alive for long, you know.'

2596
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:15,870
The Sister's blue eyes were sympathetic.

2597
02:29:15,870 --> 02:29:17,800
'We all know that, Sister.

2598
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:24,890
It's just wonderful he can be in a place like
this for the rest of his short life.'

2599
02:29:24,890 --> 02:29:29,160
Daniel looked around in the dim light at the
clean, neat yard.

2600
02:29:29,160 --> 02:29:33,750
'And where is Mr Nelson?' asked the Sister.

2601
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:38,720
'He's being followed, so he's asking them
who they are!'

2602
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:39,720
Daniel laughed.

2603
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:41,210
'I'm not surprised.

2604
02:29:41,210 --> 02:29:43,370
I read about his troubles.

2605
02:29:43,370 --> 02:29:49,680
He must be very busy now, with his father
away and all those hotels to run.'

2606
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:54,930
'He needs to stay busy,' said Daniel, thinking
of Viki.

2607
02:29:54,930 --> 02:29:58,480
'Worrying about his parents, is he?'

2608
02:29:58,480 --> 02:30:01,700
'Yes, yes, that's it,' agreed Daniel.

2609
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:04,700
'He's got a lot to worry about suddenly.'

2610
02:30:04,700 --> 02:30:09,170
'And yet he still has time to think of the
orphans and the sick.

2611
02:30:09,170 --> 02:30:12,330
He's a gift from God, that's what he is.'

2612
02:30:12,330 --> 02:30:13,330
Daniel laughed.

2613
02:30:13,330 --> 02:30:14,330
'No more than you are, Sister!'

2614
02:30:14,330 --> 02:30:15,330
'Stop your nonsense, young Daniel.

2615
02:30:15,330 --> 02:30:16,330
That's my job!

2616
02:30:16,330 --> 02:30:19,200
Come and see the children.'

2617
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:27,530
And Sister Michael led Daniel into the children's
building.

2618
02:30:27,530 --> 02:30:33,431
Nelson hadn't been able to communicate with
the driver of the black car.

2619
02:30:33,431 --> 02:30:37,610
The windows were black too, and the driver
was pretending not to be there in the dark.

2620
02:30:37,610 --> 02:30:39,810
Nelson found the others inside.

2621
02:30:39,810 --> 02:30:47,740
While Daniel and his brother and sister were
playing together, he asked Sister Michael

2622
02:30:47,740 --> 02:30:50,490
for a word outside.

2623
02:30:50,490 --> 02:30:54,160
'Sister, I need your advice,' he began.

2624
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:57,900
'Whatever for, young Nelson?' asked Sister
Michael.

2625
02:30:57,900 --> 02:31:03,840
'I've had an idea about how to help people
in Sector D to learn about living with HIV

2626
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:07,540
in the community without being so afraid and
secretive.'

2627
02:31:07,540 --> 02:31:12,450
Nelson suddenly felt embarrassed.

2628
02:31:12,450 --> 02:31:17,510
This was a woman of the church who would never
have sex, never marry.

2629
02:31:17,510 --> 02:31:20,080
How could he talk to her about these things?

2630
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:22,670
'And what might that be?'

2631
02:31:22,670 --> 02:31:26,850
she asked, gesturing for him to sit with her
on a bench by the wall.

2632
02:31:26,850 --> 02:31:32,970
As Nelson told her all about his plans, and
the business plan for the charity, he forgot

2633
02:31:32,970 --> 02:31:34,230
about his embarrassment.

2634
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:42,841
In the end she declared, 'That's amazing,
young man.

2635
02:31:42,841 --> 02:31:48,420
I'm proud of you!

2636
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:51,350
What can I do to help?'

2637
02:31:51,350 --> 02:31:52,350
'I shall need nurses and experienced advisors,
a laboratory assistant, a visiting doctor,

2638
02:31:52,350 --> 02:31:53,350
drugs.

2639
02:31:53,350 --> 02:31:55,550
I need to know what those would cost and where
to find them,' said Nelson.

2640
02:31:55,550 --> 02:32:02,410
'I want to open the centre before the rains
come, so it's quite urgent.'

2641
02:32:02,410 --> 02:32:05,311
'I'll ask around,' promised Sister Michael.

2642
02:32:05,311 --> 02:32:10,610
'With the cuts in the Health Service budget,
there are lots of nurses and advisors looking

2643
02:32:10,610 --> 02:32:11,610
for work.'

2644
02:32:11,610 --> 02:32:13,271
She looked serious.

2645
02:32:13,271 --> 02:32:14,740
'But the drugs may be a problem.

2646
02:32:14,740 --> 02:32:18,160
They're just not available in this country
any more.

2647
02:32:18,160 --> 02:32:23,510
The Health Service doesn't have enough and
HIV drugs are too expensive for most people

2648
02:32:23,510 --> 02:32:24,521
to afford.'

2649
02:32:24,521 --> 02:32:30,210
'I may have to make a direct arrangement with
a drugs company abroad, then.'

2650
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:34,670
Nelson had already thought of this, and was
researching into how to do it.

2651
02:32:34,670 --> 02:32:38,350
'You'll need a qualified doctor,' said the
Sister.

2652
02:32:38,350 --> 02:32:40,430
'Can you recommend anyone?'

2653
02:32:40,430 --> 02:32:41,980
'Indeed I can.

2654
02:32:41,980 --> 02:32:43,540
He's a wonder.

2655
02:32:43,540 --> 02:32:50,521
He comes to us almost every day and gets no
more than a cup of tea as payment.'

2656
02:32:50,521 --> 02:32:53,140
'Could you let me have his number?'

2657
02:32:53,140 --> 02:32:54,593
'Of course,' said Sister Michael, standing
up.

2658
02:32:54,593 --> 02:32:55,593
'Let's go to the office.'

2659
02:32:55,593 --> 02:33:04,410
As they walked across the yard, Sister Michael
said quietly, 'Do you suppose the financial

2660
02:33:04,410 --> 02:33:09,550
crisis in the Health Ministry has anything
to do with the money they say your father

2661
02:33:09,550 --> 02:33:10,550
stole?'

2662
02:33:10,550 --> 02:33:12,880
Nelson thought a moment.

2663
02:33:12,880 --> 02:33:18,570
'You mean, someone stole it from the Health
Service budget, then tried to "borrow" from

2664
02:33:18,570 --> 02:33:21,261
the Trade Ministry to replace the missing
sum?'

2665
02:33:21,261 --> 02:33:24,540
'Maybe your father stood up to them and refused.'

2666
02:33:24,540 --> 02:33:32,160
'So,' said Nelson, 'they accused him of stealing
the money so as not to be found out themselves.'

2667
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:37,650
'It wouldn't be the first time in the history
of human beings,' said Sister Michael with

2668
02:33:37,650 --> 02:33:39,760
a sad smile.

2669
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:40,760
***

2670
02:33:40,760 --> 02:33:44,090
Nelson dropped Daniel off on his way home
later.

2671
02:33:44,090 --> 02:33:50,550
There was no news at home, and Philomena and
Cook had both gone to the staff cottage.

2672
02:33:50,550 --> 02:33:53,670
Nelson found it difficult to relax.

2673
02:33:53,670 --> 02:33:56,300
He kept expecting the police to come back.

2674
02:33:56,300 --> 02:34:02,900
He gave up trying to sleep and went on with
his business plan, but he couldn't help thinking

2675
02:34:02,900 --> 02:34:04,930
about his father's problems too.

2676
02:34:04,930 --> 02:34:09,870
He thought about trying to prove who had put
his father in this position.

2677
02:34:09,870 --> 02:34:13,471
It must be someone really high up in the government.

2678
02:34:13,471 --> 02:34:16,210
That meant they'd be very powerful.

2679
02:34:16,210 --> 02:34:20,150
Eventually he decided he was right not to
have anything to do with politics.

2680
02:34:20,150 --> 02:34:21,150
***

2681
02:34:21,150 --> 02:34:28,850
Over the next few days, Nelson went to see
the other two smaller hotels and got to know

2682
02:34:28,850 --> 02:34:30,300
more of the staff.

2683
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:36,020
He read about his fathers supposed crimes
in the papers and the Intelligence Agency's

2684
02:34:36,020 --> 02:34:40,890
guesses as to where Washington Mbizi was now.

2685
02:34:40,890 --> 02:34:46,391
He tried calling his mother several times
on her mobile, but she was always out of range.

2686
02:34:46,391 --> 02:34:53,240
When he'd finished his business plan, with
help from Sister Michael and her doctor, he

2687
02:34:53,240 --> 02:34:54,870
took it to his bank.

2688
02:34:54,870 --> 02:35:00,670
They took a couple of days to approve it and
passed it directly on to a lawyer.

2689
02:35:00,670 --> 02:35:06,570
After two hours of detailed questions and
answers and filling in forms, the lawyer told

2690
02:35:06,570 --> 02:35:12,840
him it was a good plan, so Nelson prepared
the final documents asking for money to start

2691
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:14,070
up a drop-in centre.

2692
02:35:14,070 --> 02:35:19,870
If the charity in America said yes, his dream
would be possible.

2693
02:35:19,870 --> 02:35:25,400
The day he sent the documents by email, Nelson
felt a bit lost.

2694
02:35:25,400 --> 02:35:29,930
That plan had kept him busy when he wasn't
doing hotel work.

2695
02:35:29,930 --> 02:35:35,990
Now he had nothing to do except wait - and
try not to worry about his parents.

2696
02:35:35,990 --> 02:35:42,101
As he was having dinner alone at home, Philomena
told him there'd been a phone call from his

2697
02:35:42,101 --> 02:35:43,160
mother that day.

2698
02:35:43,160 --> 02:35:48,990
'She just said she was fine and she'd call
again,' Philomena said.

2699
02:35:48,990 --> 02:35:53,740
So Nelson called his mother's mobile, feeling
relieved and pleased.

2700
02:35:53,740 --> 02:36:00,180
But instead of hearing her voice, he heard
a machine saying, 'This number is no longer

2701
02:36:00,180 --> 02:36:01,180
in service.'

2702
02:36:01,180 --> 02:36:08,070
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

2703
02:36:08,070 --> 02:36:09,310
Good news

2704
02:36:09,310 --> 02:36:17,780
At the hotel two mornings later, there was
a tall man with sunglasses waiting for Nelson.

2705
02:36:17,780 --> 02:36:21,460
He wasn't the man from the police station.

2706
02:36:21,460 --> 02:36:23,780
He asked to go somewhere private.

2707
02:36:23,780 --> 02:36:27,620
Nelson felt a great stone settle in his stomach.

2708
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:34,490
In Mr Mbizi's office the man asked Nelson,
'You heard from your father?'

2709
02:36:34,490 --> 02:36:38,770
'No, not for a few days,' answered Nelson.

2710
02:36:38,770 --> 02:36:41,020
'I'm getting really worried.

2711
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:47,540
He hasn't been away so long without being
in touch before - and all that rubbish in

2712
02:36:47,540 --> 02:36:48,660
the papers...'

2713
02:36:48,660 --> 02:36:54,090
'He was in Johannesburg until yesterday,'
the man said.

2714
02:36:54,090 --> 02:36:56,101
'But now we can't find him.'

2715
02:36:56,101 --> 02:36:57,670
Nelson was shocked.

2716
02:36:57,670 --> 02:36:59,760
'I... haven't heard anything.

2717
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:00,760
I...

2718
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:06,040
I haven't been able to contact either him
or my mother.'

2719
02:37:06,040 --> 02:37:09,030
'I just thought you should know.

2720
02:37:09,030 --> 02:37:15,070
We think the people he was working for - the
ones he stole the money for - we think they've

2721
02:37:15,070 --> 02:37:16,990
decided to get rid of him.'

2722
02:37:16,990 --> 02:37:20,330
'What are you saying?' asked Nelson, horrified.

2723
02:37:20,330 --> 02:37:21,340
'Don't know.

2724
02:37:21,340 --> 02:37:26,760
Why don't you try to reach him?'

2725
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:28,180
The man went to the door.

2726
02:37:28,180 --> 02:37:33,480
'And don't try leaving the country yourself,'
he said as he left.

2727
02:37:33,480 --> 02:37:38,530
Nelson tried to think.

2728
02:37:38,530 --> 02:37:43,260
His father hadn't stolen any money for anyone,
so there wasn't anyone wanting to get rid

2729
02:37:43,260 --> 02:37:44,790
of him.

2730
02:37:44,790 --> 02:37:49,690
The Intelligence Agency must have lost track
of him, and now they wanted Nelson to try

2731
02:37:49,690 --> 02:37:52,850
and call him so they could listen in.

2732
02:37:52,850 --> 02:37:58,260
Or had they 'got rid of him' themselves and
were trying to blame someone else?

2733
02:37:58,260 --> 02:38:04,970
With that thought, Nelson jumped up in panic
just as he heard an email arrive on his laptop.

2734
02:38:04,970 --> 02:38:06,381
The charity had accepted his proposal!

2735
02:38:06,381 --> 02:38:12,021
They had a couple more questions and wanted
to send someone to see it when the centre

2736
02:38:12,021 --> 02:38:13,370
was ready.

2737
02:38:13,370 --> 02:38:18,380
But he should go ahead if he could afford
to and the money would be available soon.

2738
02:38:18,380 --> 02:38:23,550
Nelson wanted to feel excited, but he was
much too worried.

2739
02:38:23,550 --> 02:38:29,110
He wrote a note to himself to contact the
garage owner and agree to the rent.

2740
02:38:29,110 --> 02:38:32,640
While he was doing that, his mobile rang.

2741
02:38:32,640 --> 02:38:34,271
It was a number he didn't recognise.

2742
02:38:34,271 --> 02:38:36,000
'Hello?' he said.

2743
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,300
'Hello, Nelson,' said Ruby.

2744
02:38:38,300 --> 02:38:39,370
'Mum!

2745
02:38:39,370 --> 02:38:42,590
Are you OK?

2746
02:38:42,590 --> 02:38:48,811
They're saying here that Dad might be dead.'

2747
02:38:48,811 --> 02:38:51,521
Nelson spoke quietly and shut the door.

2748
02:38:51,521 --> 02:38:54,689
'No, he's not dead.'

2749
02:38:54,689 --> 02:38:57,530
She sounded very tense.

2750
02:38:57,530 --> 02:38:58,870
'He's just... travelling.

2751
02:38:58,870 --> 02:39:04,380
I spoke to him just now.'

2752
02:39:04,380 --> 02:39:07,720
Nelson sat down suddenly in his father's chair.

2753
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:08,720
'Phew!

2754
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:12,729
And are you OK?

2755
02:39:12,729 --> 02:39:14,490
What's wrong with your phone?'

2756
02:39:14,490 --> 02:39:16,930
'I'm fine.

2757
02:39:16,930 --> 02:39:19,990
We've changed our phones so they can't find
us through the numbers.

2758
02:39:19,990 --> 02:39:23,320
I'm staying here with my cousin.'

2759
02:39:23,320 --> 02:39:27,220
'Thank God for that,' said Nelson with relief.

2760
02:39:27,220 --> 02:39:36,641
'Your father said he'd try to find an international
buyer for the Lion Hills - if you agree.'

2761
02:39:36,641 --> 02:39:39,170
Ruby's voice broke.

2762
02:39:39,170 --> 02:39:40,880
'It...

2763
02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:46,370
We won't be back for a while, and we'll need
money.'

2764
02:39:46,370 --> 02:39:48,880
Nelson's heart sank.

2765
02:39:48,880 --> 02:39:51,761
'OK, Mum.

2766
02:39:51,761 --> 02:39:55,440
I'll keep it all going till I hear from Dad.

2767
02:39:55,440 --> 02:39:56,681
Do you want me to come and see you?'

2768
02:39:56,681 --> 02:39:57,681
'No.

2769
02:39:57,681 --> 02:39:59,220
You stay there.

2770
02:39:59,220 --> 02:40:01,760
I'm fine.

2771
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:03,780
We mustn't talk for long.'

2772
02:40:03,780 --> 02:40:07,730
'Tell Dad I'll do whatever he says about the
hotel.

2773
02:40:07,730 --> 02:40:12,400
Just ask him to let me know exactly what he
wants.'

2774
02:40:12,400 --> 02:40:13,840
'Thanks, Nelson.

2775
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:16,980
I'll tell him if I can.

2776
02:40:16,980 --> 02:40:19,610
I love you.'

2777
02:40:19,610 --> 02:40:23,210
'I love you too, Mum.

2778
02:40:23,210 --> 02:40:24,210
Take real care.'

2779
02:40:24,210 --> 02:40:28,070
'Bye, Nelson.'

2780
02:40:28,070 --> 02:40:31,080
Nelson put his phone away.

2781
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:34,190
Perhaps he should change his number too.

2782
02:40:34,190 --> 02:40:38,930
But for now he had too much to do to get the
centre started.

2783
02:40:38,930 --> 02:40:43,460
He picked up the desk phone.

2784
02:40:43,460 --> 02:40:44,460
***

2785
02:40:44,460 --> 02:40:47,100
Philomena was laying the table when Nelson
got home that evening.

2786
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:51,340
'Can you come with me to Sector D after dinner?'
he asked.

2787
02:40:51,340 --> 02:40:54,330
'We've got the go-ahead for the centre.

2788
02:40:54,330 --> 02:40:57,210
I want to talk to Mr Chivasa about it.

2789
02:40:57,210 --> 02:41:01,220
I thought you might like to come too.'

2790
02:41:01,220 --> 02:41:02,830
Philomena laughed.

2791
02:41:02,830 --> 02:41:07,860
'Cook and I will make some sandwiches and
biscuits while you eat,' she promised.

2792
02:41:07,860 --> 02:41:12,710
It turned into a big party at the Chivasas'
house that evening.

2793
02:41:12,710 --> 02:41:18,570
The youngest children had gone to bed, but
they got up and joined in the fun as everyone

2794
02:41:18,570 --> 02:41:20,480
chatted and sang.

2795
02:41:20,480 --> 02:41:26,700
Mr Chivasa told Nelson he could organise getting
the old garage clean in the afternoons, after

2796
02:41:26,700 --> 02:41:29,050
he got back from his job.

2797
02:41:29,050 --> 02:41:33,340
He'd employ some of the young men in the Sector
who had no work.

2798
02:41:33,340 --> 02:41:36,681
Mrs Chivasa said she'd find women to help
too.

2799
02:41:36,681 --> 02:41:41,370
At about ten o'clock the neighbours came over
to complain about the noise.

2800
02:41:41,370 --> 02:41:47,060
But when they heard what was going on, they
joined in and brought a radio.

2801
02:41:47,060 --> 02:41:50,939
So the music went on well into the night.

2802
02:41:50,939 --> 02:41:51,939
***

2803
02:41:51,939 --> 02:41:57,780
During the next few days, Nelson organised
with Fletcher to use some money from the business

2804
02:41:57,780 --> 02:42:01,990
to open a bank account for the centre.

2805
02:42:01,990 --> 02:42:07,170
While Nelson worked long hours to prepare
the Lion Hills Hotel for sale in case his

2806
02:42:07,170 --> 02:42:13,642
father found a buyer, in Sector D Mr Chivasa
employed a work party of young men to clean

2807
02:42:13,642 --> 02:42:17,880
and paint the building, and clear the yard
at the old garage.

2808
02:42:17,880 --> 02:42:25,380
Eddy came over on his day off to lend a hand
and Daniel helped too, when he wasn't at school

2809
02:42:25,380 --> 02:42:27,750
or singing in the shopping mall.

2810
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:33,960
And in the mall, the shoppers were getting
to know Daniel.

2811
02:42:33,960 --> 02:42:39,620
He'd started singing his own songs in between
the ones he sang for the shop.

2812
02:42:39,620 --> 02:42:41,841
Sometimes he did requests.

2813
02:42:41,841 --> 02:42:47,021
One afternoon he was asked for his song 'about
the fat lady shopping'.

2814
02:42:47,021 --> 02:42:49,950
He sang it in a high, desperate voice.

2815
02:42:49,950 --> 02:42:51,470
Let me through.

2816
02:42:51,470 --> 02:42:52,610
I gotta go home.

2817
02:42:52,610 --> 02:42:55,470
Can't you see, I need more room.

2818
02:42:55,470 --> 02:42:58,090
I bought the hat and I bought the suit.

2819
02:42:58,090 --> 02:43:01,000
I bought some shoes and I bought some boots.

2820
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:04,150
I gotta get home 'cause my feet are dying,

2821
02:43:04,150 --> 02:43:06,800
Crying, trying to get home...

2822
02:43:06,800 --> 02:43:10,090
There were a lot of shouts and laughs as he
sang.

2823
02:43:10,090 --> 02:43:15,521
When he finished, a loud voice called out,
'Can you stop for a minute?

2824
02:43:15,521 --> 02:43:18,210
I want a word.'

2825
02:43:18,210 --> 02:43:24,720
Everyone turned round to see a man of about
twenty-five in sunglasses and a big hat.

2826
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:27,990
'Sure,' Daniel said to the stranger.

2827
02:43:27,990 --> 02:43:31,490
'What's your name?' asked the man.

2828
02:43:31,490 --> 02:43:35,990
'Who wants to know?' asked Daniel with a smile.

2829
02:43:35,990 --> 02:43:38,870
The man was quite short, well-dressed and
tough-looking.

2830
02:43:38,870 --> 02:43:42,900
He took off his sunglasses.

2831
02:43:42,900 --> 02:43:45,570
Daniel stepped back.

2832
02:43:45,570 --> 02:43:46,840
It was Kundai Kambera!

2833
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:52,100
'I like what I hear,' said Kundai, without
smiling.

2834
02:43:52,100 --> 02:43:54,050
'Oh, wow!'

2835
02:43:54,050 --> 02:43:57,810
For once, Daniel had nothing to say.

2836
02:43:57,810 --> 02:44:00,720
'Yes, you're good.

2837
02:44:00,720 --> 02:44:04,870
Could you do a few minutes in my show on Saturday?

2838
02:44:04,870 --> 02:44:06,780
One of my singers...

2839
02:44:06,780 --> 02:44:07,780
died yesterday.'

2840
02:44:07,780 --> 02:44:12,010
Kundai's eyes were wet.

2841
02:44:12,010 --> 02:44:14,680
He put the sunglasses back on.

2842
02:44:14,680 --> 02:44:15,810
'Sure.

2843
02:44:15,810 --> 02:44:16,960
Yeah.

2844
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:17,960
Of course!

2845
02:44:17,960 --> 02:44:20,540
What do you want me to do?'

2846
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:25,360
'Just sing two or three songs at the live
concert,' said Kundai.

2847
02:44:25,360 --> 02:44:28,780
'Do you sing more serious ones?'

2848
02:44:28,780 --> 02:44:29,931
'Yes.

2849
02:44:29,931 --> 02:44:31,750
Some of my songs are serious.'

2850
02:44:31,750 --> 02:44:34,430
'What about an instrument?'

2851
02:44:34,430 --> 02:44:38,790
'Well, I have an mbira, but I'm learning guitar.'

2852
02:44:38,790 --> 02:44:46,340
'Come to the Studio on 9th Street, number
115, tomorrow evening,' said Kundai.

2853
02:44:46,340 --> 02:44:49,490
'We'll be practising from about six.

2854
02:44:49,490 --> 02:44:52,820
I'll lend you a guitar if you need one.'

2855
02:44:52,820 --> 02:44:56,850
'Right,' said Daniel, trying to sound businesslike.

2856
02:44:56,850 --> 02:45:01,640
Kundai said, 'Have five songs ready to choose
from.'

2857
02:45:01,640 --> 02:45:04,221
'Thanks, Mr Kambera.'

2858
02:45:04,221 --> 02:45:08,870
'Thanks, your song made me smile on a sad
day.'

2859
02:45:08,870 --> 02:45:11,010
'See you tomorrow.'

2860
02:45:11,010 --> 02:45:12,550
Daniel grinned.

2861
02:45:12,550 --> 02:45:15,080
Kundai Kambera walked away.

2862
02:45:15,080 --> 02:45:20,560
Daniel saw two men, who had been looking in
shop windows, join him as he left.

2863
02:45:20,560 --> 02:45:24,900
The people around Daniel broke into excited
chatter.

2864
02:45:24,900 --> 02:45:30,729
He couldn't stop smiling, so he sang the fat
lady song again and the crowd laughed and

2865
02:45:30,729 --> 02:45:33,140
clapped.

2866
02:45:33,140 --> 02:45:37,680
Later Daniel took a bus to the cemetery.

2867
02:45:37,680 --> 02:45:42,301
He stood by his mother's grave and told her
about his good luck.

2868
02:45:42,301 --> 02:45:48,479
In the quiet sunset he sang a gentle song
to her.

2869
02:45:48,479 --> 02:45:57,490
He suddenly felt her near and heard her voice
say, 'Your talent is a gift from God.

2870
02:45:57,490 --> 02:46:01,261
Take care of it.'

2871
02:46:01,261 --> 02:46:06,220
Tears ran down his smiling face.

2872
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:12,290
Stars were shining in the black sky when he
left.

2873
02:46:12,290 --> 02:46:20,470
On his way home, Daniel stopped at the phone
box in Sector D and called Phil, the cameraman.

2874
02:46:20,470 --> 02:46:26,350
He told him about being in Kundai's live show
on Saturday, and about Nelson's new drop-in

2875
02:46:26,350 --> 02:46:27,670
centre.

2876
02:46:27,670 --> 02:46:33,320
Phil said he'd see what his programme boss
thought of the story.

2877
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:35,010
Daniel ran home.

2878
02:46:35,010 --> 02:46:39,500
It had been a happy day.

2879
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:44,740
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

2880
02:46:44,740 --> 02:46:48,800
A day for sadness

2881
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:53,550
That Friday, Nelson had a message from his
father.

2882
02:46:53,550 --> 02:46:59,160
Washington Mbizi had called the lawyer, Mrs
Murape, and she called Nelson.

2883
02:46:59,160 --> 02:47:06,240
He was to expect a man called Paul Walker
from Sydney, Australia, to arrive in Kurupenda

2884
02:47:06,240 --> 02:47:10,180
the next day to discuss buying the Lion Hills
Hotel.

2885
02:47:10,180 --> 02:47:16,550
Mr Walker knew the hotel, as he'd stayed there
on business in the past.

2886
02:47:16,550 --> 02:47:21,040
Nelson had planned to take the day off, but
he spent the morning checking everything with

2887
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:25,650
Fletcher and the department managers, and
making sure that they would be available the

2888
02:47:25,650 --> 02:47:27,350
next day.

2889
02:47:27,350 --> 02:47:32,220
After lunch he drove over to the old garage
in Sector D.

2890
02:47:32,220 --> 02:47:36,840
When he got there, he couldn't believe the
progress.

2891
02:47:36,840 --> 02:47:44,340
The outside was now bright blue and the doors
and windows were newly painted white.

2892
02:47:44,340 --> 02:47:50,210
Red flowers on the great flamboyant tree were
beginning to open.

2893
02:47:50,210 --> 02:47:54,890
The ground around the building was clear and
a row of chairs stood against the back wall,

2894
02:47:54,890 --> 02:47:58,010
all different shapes and colours.

2895
02:47:58,010 --> 02:48:05,421
The main door had a small tree on either side
and was open, with a curtain to stop the flies.

2896
02:48:05,421 --> 02:48:07,280
Loud music was coming from inside.

2897
02:48:07,280 --> 02:48:15,040
A large notice above the door said, 'THE GARAGE
will repair your life.'

2898
02:48:15,040 --> 02:48:18,580
Nelson laughed and pushed his way through
the curtain.

2899
02:48:18,580 --> 02:48:23,690
His dream really was coming true.

2900
02:48:23,690 --> 02:48:26,840
Daniel and Eddy were there with lots of other
young people.

2901
02:48:26,840 --> 02:48:30,820
A radio played on the clean, empty floor.

2902
02:48:30,820 --> 02:48:31,820
'Hey!'

2903
02:48:31,820 --> 02:48:32,979
called Nelson.

2904
02:48:32,979 --> 02:48:33,979
'Nelson!

2905
02:48:33,979 --> 02:48:36,560
Great to see you!'

2906
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:37,560
shouted Daniel.

2907
02:48:37,560 --> 02:48:39,551
'This is brilliant!

2908
02:48:39,551 --> 02:48:42,480
Someone's been working hard!'

2909
02:48:42,480 --> 02:48:47,570
'Lots of someones!' said Eddy as he and Daniel
came over to Nelson.

2910
02:48:47,570 --> 02:48:50,580
'But there's still a lot to do.'

2911
02:48:50,580 --> 02:48:51,580
Daniel laughed.

2912
02:48:51,580 --> 02:48:56,030
'All the kitchen equipment, and the laboratory,
and...'

2913
02:48:56,030 --> 02:49:00,160
Kundai Kambera's voice on the radio suddenly
filled the room with song.

2914
02:49:00,160 --> 02:49:02,510
Eddy shouted to Nelson, 'Did you know Daniel's
singing in Kundai's live show at the stadium

2915
02:49:02,510 --> 02:49:04,630
tomorrow night?

2916
02:49:04,630 --> 02:49:12,030
He met him at the shopping mall.'

2917
02:49:12,030 --> 02:49:13,090
'Hey!

2918
02:49:13,090 --> 02:49:15,050
Congratulations!' said Nelson.

2919
02:49:15,050 --> 02:49:16,851
'That's fantastic!

2920
02:49:16,851 --> 02:49:20,400
Are you going to be another Kundai then, Daniel?

2921
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:22,820
'Sure,' replied Daniel over the music.

2922
02:49:22,820 --> 02:49:30,140
'He's from an even poorer place than Sector
D. And now look at him!'

2923
02:49:30,140 --> 02:49:34,090
'Darling of the radio stations, a thousand
girls running after him,' shouted Nelson.

2924
02:49:34,090 --> 02:49:35,610
'Not quite you, somehow.'

2925
02:49:35,610 --> 02:49:40,190
'A hundred girls would be enough for me,'
answered Daniel.

2926
02:49:40,190 --> 02:49:43,290
'At least to start with!'

2927
02:49:43,290 --> 02:49:46,320
They laughed so much they didn't hear Primrose
come in.

2928
02:49:46,320 --> 02:49:48,640
'Hey, guys!'

2929
02:49:48,640 --> 02:49:49,950
she called.

2930
02:49:49,950 --> 02:49:51,870
She looked very serious.

2931
02:49:51,870 --> 02:49:56,920
'Hi, Mrs Chivasa,' said Daniel, turning the
radio down.

2932
02:49:56,920 --> 02:50:01,021
'Mr Chivasa just had a call on his work mobile.

2933
02:50:01,021 --> 02:50:04,261
I'm sorry, Daniel, Eddy, but...

2934
02:50:04,261 --> 02:50:13,160
It was Sister Michael to say that Blessing
has died.'

2935
02:50:13,160 --> 02:50:17,870
The boys put their arms around each other
and hid their faces.

2936
02:50:17,870 --> 02:50:24,290
'She says they'll bury him tomorrow morning
at the hospice unless you want him buried

2937
02:50:24,290 --> 02:50:26,580
with his mother.

2938
02:50:26,580 --> 02:50:29,280
Please call her back.'

2939
02:50:29,280 --> 02:50:32,340
After a few seconds, Eddy looked up.

2940
02:50:32,340 --> 02:50:36,880
'Thank you, Mrs Chivasa,' he said.

2941
02:50:36,880 --> 02:50:42,471
Daniel wiped tears off his face and said,
'We'd better get over there.'

2942
02:50:42,471 --> 02:50:44,479
'I'll take you,' said Nelson.

2943
02:50:44,479 --> 02:50:49,450
On the way, Daniel suddenly remembered something.

2944
02:50:49,450 --> 02:50:55,580
'I'd better call Phil later and tell him not
to bother trying to come,' he said.

2945
02:50:55,580 --> 02:51:01,320
Nelson's hand on the steering wheel shook,
but he kept his voice calm as he said, 'Did

2946
02:51:01,320 --> 02:51:03,470
he say they'd come to the show tomorrow?'

2947
02:51:03,470 --> 02:51:06,190
'He said they might.

2948
02:51:06,190 --> 02:51:09,940
But I'm not sure if I'll be able to do the
show now.

2949
02:51:09,940 --> 02:51:15,180
It doesn't seem right with little Blessing...'

2950
02:51:15,180 --> 02:51:17,640
There were tears on Daniel's cheeks.

2951
02:51:17,640 --> 02:51:20,490
Nelson put a hand on his arm.

2952
02:51:20,490 --> 02:51:25,860
'I think you'll find that Kundai will expect
you to sing as promised.

2953
02:51:25,860 --> 02:51:28,910
But call Phil now, if you want.'

2954
02:51:28,910 --> 02:51:33,340
Nelson got his mobile out of his pocket.

2955
02:51:33,340 --> 02:51:35,150
Daniel sighed.

2956
02:51:35,150 --> 02:51:43,630
'Well, even so, I don't really want the TV
people around,' he said as he pressed the

2957
02:51:43,630 --> 02:51:45,390
numbers.

2958
02:51:45,390 --> 02:51:47,160
'Yebo?'

2959
02:51:47,160 --> 02:51:49,000
Phil answered his phone.

2960
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:50,030
'Phil?

2961
02:51:50,030 --> 02:51:54,160
This is Daniel Mawadza.'

2962
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:56,230
'Hi, Daniel.

2963
02:51:56,230 --> 02:51:58,300
What's up?'

2964
02:51:58,300 --> 02:52:05,920
'Phil, my little brother just died, so I don't
think it's a good idea to come tomorrow, after

2965
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:06,920
all.'

2966
02:52:06,920 --> 02:52:08,920
'I'm with Viki.

2967
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:10,920
She was saying we might make it.

2968
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:12,381
Hang on.

2969
02:52:12,381 --> 02:52:15,220
I'll just tell her.'

2970
02:52:15,220 --> 02:52:17,729
There was a pause.

2971
02:52:17,729 --> 02:52:19,950
Suddenly Daniel was listening to Viki's voice.

2972
02:52:19,950 --> 02:52:20,950
'Hey, Daniel.

2973
02:52:20,950 --> 02:52:23,710
Sorry to hear about little Blessing.

2974
02:52:23,710 --> 02:52:27,000
Are you going to have a funeral?'

2975
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:34,090
'We're going to bury him with my mum and we
hope Sister Michael will come and say some

2976
02:52:34,090 --> 02:52:35,090
words.

2977
02:52:35,090 --> 02:52:36,090
Why?'

2978
02:52:36,090 --> 02:52:39,660
'That would make great TV, so we'll be there...'

2979
02:52:39,660 --> 02:52:40,660
'But...'

2980
02:52:40,660 --> 02:52:41,660
'And you're in Kundai Kambera's live show,
aren't you?

2981
02:52:41,660 --> 02:52:42,660
Tomorrow night at the football stadium?'

2982
02:52:42,660 --> 02:52:43,970
'Yes, but I...

2983
02:52:43,970 --> 02:52:45,380
You could...

2984
02:52:45,380 --> 02:52:51,560
In ten days or so Nelson's drop-in centre
opens.

2985
02:52:51,560 --> 02:52:52,560
That would be more interesting.'

2986
02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:53,560
'Not so, Daniel.

2987
02:52:53,560 --> 02:52:54,560
Babies dying are better television.

2988
02:52:54,560 --> 02:52:59,500
The viewers like to hear about bad luck.

2989
02:52:59,500 --> 02:53:06,010
Makes them feel good about their own lives.'

2990
02:53:06,010 --> 02:53:07,650
Daniel felt sick.

2991
02:53:07,650 --> 02:53:11,540
'Do what you want,' he said and pressed the
red button.

2992
02:53:11,540 --> 02:53:17,280
'I'm not so sure about her any more,' he said
as he handed the phone back to Nelson.

2993
02:53:17,280 --> 02:53:19,580
'Who do you mean?'

2994
02:53:19,580 --> 02:53:20,580
Nelson asked.

2995
02:53:20,580 --> 02:53:21,700
'That was Viki.

2996
02:53:21,700 --> 02:53:25,330
They're coming tomorrow to film the funeral.

2997
02:53:25,330 --> 02:53:28,620
She says bad luck stories make good TV.'

2998
02:53:28,620 --> 02:53:33,060
'Pretty sad, huh?' said Eddy.

2999
02:53:33,060 --> 02:53:38,300
Daniel went on, 'I met someone when I was
practising at the studio with Kundai.

3000
02:53:38,300 --> 02:53:41,300
This girl used to know Viki at school.

3001
02:53:41,300 --> 02:53:46,640
She said Viki was not always so... so...'

3002
02:53:46,640 --> 02:53:48,880
'So nasty?'

3003
02:53:48,880 --> 02:53:49,880
Nelson asked.

3004
02:53:49,880 --> 02:53:53,440
'I was thinking of a different word,' said
Daniel.

3005
02:53:53,440 --> 02:53:58,690
'I know it's probably just anger, but it's
eating her up.'

3006
02:53:58,690 --> 02:54:02,330
'We're all pretty angry these days,' said
Eddy.

3007
02:54:02,330 --> 02:54:04,521
'I'm still angry about Mum.

3008
02:54:04,521 --> 02:54:11,221
I have to run up and down the street sometimes,
so I don't lose my temper.

3009
02:54:11,221 --> 02:54:14,630
How do you feel about what's happening to
your dad, Nelson?'

3010
02:54:14,630 --> 02:54:19,520
'Usually I'm too busy to think about how I
feel these days.'

3011
02:54:19,520 --> 02:54:22,680
Nelson was quiet for a few moments.

3012
02:54:22,680 --> 02:54:31,260
Then he went on, 'I learned a long time ago
not to let anger stop me thinking, at least

3013
02:54:31,260 --> 02:54:33,790
not for long.

3014
02:54:33,790 --> 02:54:39,550
My dad did a lot of things that made me angry,
and if I showed it, he just locked me up or

3015
02:54:39,550 --> 02:54:43,370
hit me... or both.'

3016
02:54:43,370 --> 02:54:59,760
'Well, today is for sadness, not anger,' said
Daniel, and they drove on in silence.

3017
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:00,760
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

3018
02:55:00,760 --> 02:55:02,991
Goodbye, Blessing

3019
02:55:02,991 --> 02:55:09,050
Everyone was at the cemetery very early next
day.

3020
02:55:09,050 --> 02:55:16,271
The sun made long shadows of the few tired
trees and the silent crowd round Melanie Mawadza's

3021
02:55:16,271 --> 02:55:17,729
grave.

3022
02:55:17,729 --> 02:55:23,240
Only Nelson was missing as he had to meet
the Australian at the airport.

3023
02:55:23,240 --> 02:55:26,610
Daniel noticed Viki and Phil arrive.

3024
02:55:26,610 --> 02:55:30,820
He couldn't believe they were really so heartless.

3025
02:55:30,820 --> 02:55:37,770
He walked over to them and, looking down at
Viki, said, 'Do not say a word, or move anyone

3026
02:55:37,770 --> 02:55:39,210
or anything around.

3027
02:55:39,210 --> 02:55:42,660
I don't want to know you're here.'

3028
02:55:42,660 --> 02:55:46,771
Viki looked surprised at his anger and said,
'OK, Daniel.

3029
02:55:46,771 --> 02:55:50,270
Just a fly on the wall, as we say.'

3030
02:55:50,270 --> 02:55:52,360
'Right,' said Daniel.

3031
02:55:52,360 --> 02:55:58,860
He nodded to Phil, who nodded back sympathetically,
and returned to the graveside.

3032
02:55:58,860 --> 02:56:04,310
Sister Michael was saying, 'Blessing died
with a smile on his face.

3033
02:56:04,310 --> 02:56:09,850
He knew he would be with his mother soon.'

3034
02:56:09,850 --> 02:56:15,840
Daniel found he couldn't stop his tears enough
to sing, so little Blessing was gently lowered

3035
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:20,120
into the earth on top of his mother in silence.

3036
02:56:20,120 --> 02:56:27,250
Then Philomena and other friends began the
loud traditional weeping.

3037
02:56:27,250 --> 02:56:30,170
Suddenly Lily Anne fell to the ground.

3038
02:56:30,170 --> 02:56:33,570
Eddy and Daniel both put an arm round her.

3039
02:56:33,570 --> 02:56:35,271
Sister Michael came over.

3040
02:56:35,271 --> 02:56:40,590
'Eddy, can you come back to the hospice with
Lily Anne?

3041
02:56:40,590 --> 02:56:44,960
We need to do some paperwork, and you're the
man of the family.'

3042
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:48,971
'Come on, Lily Anne,' said Eddy.

3043
02:56:48,971 --> 02:56:51,400
'You've grown too much for me to carry you.'

3044
02:56:51,400 --> 02:56:55,360
He walked her slowly towards the hospice truck.

3045
02:56:55,360 --> 02:56:58,120
Sister Michael turned to Daniel.

3046
02:56:58,120 --> 02:57:01,580
'Get back home now, Daniel,' she said kindly.

3047
02:57:01,580 --> 02:57:04,430
'You'll need your strength for tonight.

3048
02:57:04,430 --> 02:57:10,840
You can cry for Blessing tomorrow, if you
must, but you know he's better where he is.'

3049
02:57:10,840 --> 02:57:12,890
'Thank you, Sister.

3050
02:57:12,890 --> 02:57:15,860
I'll be OK in a minute.'

3051
02:57:15,860 --> 02:57:16,860
'Right then.

3052
02:57:16,860 --> 02:57:18,150
Good luck tonight!'

3053
02:57:18,150 --> 02:57:26,930
As the truck drove away, Daniel turned and
saw Viki and Phil.

3054
02:57:26,930 --> 02:57:29,490
They were arguing about something, as usual.

3055
02:57:29,490 --> 02:57:34,900
He walked over to them, his anger suddenly
sharp as a knife.

3056
02:57:34,900 --> 02:57:35,900
'So.

3057
02:57:35,900 --> 02:57:39,450
Are you happy now?' he said directly to Viki.

3058
02:57:39,450 --> 02:57:42,450
'What do you mean?' asked Viki.

3059
02:57:42,450 --> 02:57:45,101
'Got your pictures of the dead baby going
home to his dead mother, and his brothers

3060
02:57:45,101 --> 02:57:46,771
and sister crying, did you?'

3061
02:57:46,771 --> 02:57:47,771
'Yes.

3062
02:57:47,771 --> 02:57:49,750
We did.

3063
02:57:49,750 --> 02:57:53,729
We got exactly that.'

3064
02:57:53,729 --> 02:57:55,150
Viki's eyes flashed.

3065
02:57:55,150 --> 02:57:57,011
But Daniel couldn't stop.

3066
02:57:57,011 --> 02:57:59,790
'Well, isn't that nice?

3067
02:57:59,790 --> 02:58:04,181
Now all your viewers can see how death tidies
up after AIDS.

3068
02:58:04,181 --> 02:58:09,729
They can think how lucky they've been that
they haven't lost their whole family yet.

3069
02:58:09,729 --> 02:58:14,530
They can think how lucky I am that I still
have a brother and a sister.

3070
02:58:14,530 --> 02:58:20,700
But then, perhaps you haven't thought that
some of them may be in a worse situation than

3071
02:58:20,700 --> 02:58:21,700
I am...'

3072
02:58:21,700 --> 02:58:22,830
'I doubt it.'

3073
02:58:22,830 --> 02:58:25,479
Viki was standing as tall as she could.

3074
02:58:25,479 --> 02:58:30,931
'Most of the people who watch my stuff aren't
from places like Sector D where there's nowhere

3075
02:58:30,931 --> 02:58:33,150
they can go for help.

3076
02:58:33,150 --> 02:58:37,790
Some of the people who see these programmes
have plenty of time and money.

3077
02:58:37,790 --> 02:58:45,660
So that's what I'm saying in my pieces - that
things are really, really bad, and they must

3078
02:58:45,660 --> 02:58:46,660
do something.'

3079
02:58:46,660 --> 02:58:52,880
'And yet when you meet someone who really
is doing something, you can't even be polite!'

3080
02:58:52,880 --> 02:58:59,480
Daniel was trying not to shout in this holy
place, but all his fear and sadness were pouring

3081
02:58:59,480 --> 02:59:00,480
out as anger.

3082
02:59:00,480 --> 02:59:02,110
'I suppose you mean Nelson.

3083
02:59:02,110 --> 02:59:06,700
I suppose he's been telling you that I was
a bit cold to him.

3084
02:59:06,700 --> 02:59:10,740
Well, he was trying to be romantic and it
was stupid.'

3085
02:59:10,740 --> 02:59:15,301
'And that's not allowed with a professional
woman like you, of course.

3086
02:59:15,301 --> 02:59:23,120
A woman who uses other people's bad luck to
move up in her career, to make herself a TV

3087
02:59:23,120 --> 02:59:24,120
star.'

3088
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:25,120
Viki gasped.

3089
02:59:25,120 --> 02:59:27,420
'Is that what you think I'm doing?'

3090
02:59:27,420 --> 02:59:30,430
'I don't think,' shouted Daniel, 'I know!

3091
02:59:30,430 --> 02:59:38,272
I see you making money out of the deaths of
babies, out of the grief of orphans and grandmothers,

3092
02:59:38,272 --> 02:59:40,450
and it turns my stomach.'

3093
02:59:40,450 --> 02:59:43,421
Viki's eyes suddenly filled with tears.

3094
02:59:43,421 --> 02:59:47,970
'You have no idea what you're saying,' she
said.

3095
02:59:47,970 --> 02:59:48,970
'I...

3096
02:59:48,970 --> 02:59:49,970
I don't believe...

3097
02:59:49,970 --> 02:59:53,681
you can believe...'

3098
02:59:53,681 --> 03:00:00,120
She turned away... and walked straight into
a tree she hadn't seen behind her.

3099
03:00:00,120 --> 03:00:05,330
She dropped her notebook and sat down slowly
on the earth at the foot of the tree.

3100
03:00:05,330 --> 03:00:10,060
She hid her face in her hands and made strange,
hard sounds.

3101
03:00:10,060 --> 03:00:15,700
Her whole body shook and tears bled through
her fingers.

3102
03:00:15,700 --> 03:00:18,440
Daniel stood staring in horror.

3103
03:00:18,440 --> 03:00:24,510
He looked round for Phil, but he had already
gone to their truck out on the main road.

3104
03:00:24,510 --> 03:00:27,851
Daniel walked quickly away from the tree.

3105
03:00:27,851 --> 03:00:30,380
Then he walked back again.

3106
03:00:30,380 --> 03:00:34,391
Viki was still on the ground.

3107
03:00:34,391 --> 03:00:38,090
He walked away again, and stood beside another
new grave.

3108
03:00:38,090 --> 03:00:43,500
There were plastic flowers, white against
the red earth, lying on it.

3109
03:00:43,500 --> 03:00:48,470
He took a deep breath and remembered what
Nelson had said about not letting his anger

3110
03:00:48,470 --> 03:00:51,110
stop him from thinking.

3111
03:00:51,110 --> 03:00:54,450
He turned and looked at Viki again.

3112
03:00:54,450 --> 03:00:57,729
She was wiping her face on her blouse.

3113
03:00:57,729 --> 03:01:01,229
She looked up and saw him still there.

3114
03:01:01,229 --> 03:01:06,000
She stood up quickly and looked around for
her notebook.

3115
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:09,920
Daniel walked over and picked it up from behind
the tree.

3116
03:01:09,920 --> 03:01:14,960
As he gave it to her, she whispered, 'Thank
you.'

3117
03:01:14,960 --> 03:01:17,870
He walked beside her in silence towards the
road.

3118
03:01:17,870 --> 03:01:24,600
'You're wrong about me, you know,' she said
at last.

3119
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:27,370
'Perhaps I am,' said Daniel.

3120
03:01:27,370 --> 03:01:33,979
'And anyway it doesn't matter what a sixteen-year-old
schoolboy thinks of you.

3121
03:01:33,979 --> 03:01:39,780
But it does matter what other people say about
you, and I don't like to see you making people

3122
03:01:39,780 --> 03:01:41,680
hate you.

3123
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:45,690
You can be kind, I've seen it.'

3124
03:01:45,690 --> 03:01:47,670
They stopped beside the truck.

3125
03:01:47,670 --> 03:01:50,830
'Do they hate me?

3126
03:01:50,830 --> 03:01:53,190
Actually hate me?'

3127
03:01:53,190 --> 03:01:57,830
'Well, you're not exactly lovable most of
the time.'

3128
03:01:57,830 --> 03:01:59,950
'Nor is this world.'

3129
03:01:59,950 --> 03:02:02,430
There was anger in her eyes again.

3130
03:02:02,430 --> 03:02:10,610
'You may think so, and perhaps you're right...
but I usually find it rather wonderful,' said

3131
03:02:10,610 --> 03:02:11,960
Daniel.

3132
03:02:11,960 --> 03:02:17,770
'You're... different,' she said, with a small
smile.

3133
03:02:17,770 --> 03:02:18,950
'No.

3134
03:02:18,950 --> 03:02:21,530
We're all born the same.

3135
03:02:21,530 --> 03:02:24,970
We just become different and forget about
the sameness.'

3136
03:02:24,970 --> 03:02:27,620
'That's what I mean.

3137
03:02:27,620 --> 03:02:30,160
You think differently!'

3138
03:02:30,160 --> 03:02:33,000
Her smile grew.

3139
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:37,620
She really was beautiful when her eyes weren't
burning.

3140
03:02:37,620 --> 03:02:40,070
Daniel wanted Nelson to see her like this.

3141
03:02:40,070 --> 03:02:43,920
'Where are you going now?' he asked.

3142
03:02:43,920 --> 03:02:48,020
'We're going to try and get an interview with
Kundai before his show.'

3143
03:02:48,020 --> 03:02:55,200
'Why don't you come over to the Garage,' he
suggested, 'and see how it's getting on?'

3144
03:02:55,200 --> 03:02:57,980
'I'm hungry now,' she smiled, 'after all those
tears.

3145
03:02:57,980 --> 03:03:01,971
Do you want to come with us and get a sandwich
on the way?

3146
03:03:01,971 --> 03:03:04,670
Or is someone taking you back?'

3147
03:03:04,670 --> 03:03:11,061
'Will Phil look after me if you go back to
being angry?' asked Daniel, making a little-boy

3148
03:03:11,061 --> 03:03:12,061
face.

3149
03:03:12,061 --> 03:03:16,130
'Will he protect me if you get angry again?'

3150
03:03:16,130 --> 03:03:17,750
Viki almost laughed.

3151
03:03:17,750 --> 03:03:23,811
Phil looked confused, but smiled and said,
'I'll sit in the middle.'

3152
03:03:23,811 --> 03:03:26,050
Which made them all laugh.

3153
03:03:26,050 --> 03:03:31,250
At the sandwich bar they got sandwiches and
bottles of water.

3154
03:03:31,250 --> 03:03:36,660
They took them outside, sat on the wall in
the shade and ate in silence.

3155
03:03:36,660 --> 03:03:43,270
Then, as they were collecting up their rubbish
to put in the bin, Viki went round the other

3156
03:03:43,270 --> 03:03:45,820
side of the truck.

3157
03:03:45,820 --> 03:03:49,110
Daniel could see her through the windows.

3158
03:03:49,110 --> 03:03:54,950
She got some pills out of her bag and took
them with some water from her bottle.

3159
03:03:54,950 --> 03:03:57,780
Daniel went round the truck and stood behind
her.

3160
03:03:57,780 --> 03:04:01,810
'How often do you take those?' he asked.

3161
03:04:01,810 --> 03:04:05,170
She jumped and then turned to look up at him.

3162
03:04:05,170 --> 03:04:09,780
'Oh, just when I have a headache,' she said
with a smile.

3163
03:04:09,780 --> 03:04:13,920
'You're lying,' he said sadly.

3164
03:04:13,920 --> 03:04:18,780
'You take them three times a day, with food,
don't you?'

3165
03:04:18,780 --> 03:04:24,271
'None of your business,' said Viki, looking
him straight in the eyes.

3166
03:04:24,271 --> 03:04:26,900
'Keep out of my life, Daniel.'

3167
03:04:26,900 --> 03:04:29,240
'I'm in your life for a reason.

3168
03:04:29,240 --> 03:04:31,841
And you're in my life for a reason.'

3169
03:04:31,841 --> 03:04:32,841
'No, Daniel.

3170
03:04:32,841 --> 03:04:34,710
Life isn't like that.'

3171
03:04:34,710 --> 03:04:40,229
'It is... if you want it to be.'

3172
03:04:40,229 --> 03:04:42,580
She turned away and got into the truck.

3173
03:04:42,580 --> 03:04:46,480
'We'll go to the Garage,' she said.

3174
03:04:46,480 --> 03:04:50,260
So Phil drove them to Sector D.

3175
03:04:50,260 --> 03:04:54,240
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

3176
03:04:54,240 --> 03:04:56,901
Meeting at the Garage

3177
03:04:56,901 --> 03:05:02,931
As they drove, Daniel's thoughts raced.

3178
03:05:02,931 --> 03:05:06,020
'What must it be like for Viki?

3179
03:05:06,020 --> 03:05:09,180
No wonder she keeps people away from her.

3180
03:05:09,180 --> 03:05:13,380
And how am I going to tell Nelson?'

3181
03:05:13,380 --> 03:05:18,080
Meanwhile, he was directing them to the Garage.

3182
03:05:18,080 --> 03:05:21,410
When they got there, Viki gasped.

3183
03:05:21,410 --> 03:05:23,900
It looked wonderful.

3184
03:05:23,900 --> 03:05:27,320
The sun was shining on the newly cleaned roof.

3185
03:05:27,320 --> 03:05:31,170
There was a line of teenagers planting something
along the back fence.

3186
03:05:31,170 --> 03:05:36,060
They were singing a Kundai song about 'Love
in the time of AIDS'.

3187
03:05:36,060 --> 03:05:41,400
There was different music coming out of the
main door and a couple of girls were sitting

3188
03:05:41,400 --> 03:05:47,190
in the shade counting tiny packets of biscuits
from one box to another.

3189
03:05:47,190 --> 03:05:51,021
Phil parked the truck under the big tree in
the back yard.

3190
03:05:51,021 --> 03:05:54,580
'Amazing...' he said to Daniel, with a big
smile.

3191
03:05:54,580 --> 03:05:58,420
'This might work!' said Viki, as she got out.

3192
03:05:58,420 --> 03:06:03,970
She walked off round the side of the building
to explore further.

3193
03:06:03,970 --> 03:06:09,020
Daniel couldn't see Nelson's truck, but he
knew Nelson would be on his way to the Garage

3194
03:06:09,020 --> 03:06:10,820
with Sister Michael and her nurse.

3195
03:06:10,820 --> 03:06:15,729
They had an appointment to meet the man who
was going to furnish the clinic.

3196
03:06:15,729 --> 03:06:19,820
Phil walked away with his camera, and Viki
wasn't in sight.

3197
03:06:19,820 --> 03:06:25,930
Daniel heard Nelson's truck coming and stood
ready to open his door.

3198
03:06:25,930 --> 03:06:29,420
Sister Michael and the nurse got out the other
side.

3199
03:06:29,420 --> 03:06:35,920
'I need to tell you something very important,'
Daniel said in Nelson's ear.

3200
03:06:35,920 --> 03:06:38,330
'Go ahead,' said Nelson.

3201
03:06:38,330 --> 03:06:39,940
'Not here.

3202
03:06:39,940 --> 03:06:44,921
It's... well, it seems to be a secret...'

3203
03:06:44,921 --> 03:06:45,921
'Right.'

3204
03:06:45,921 --> 03:06:50,790
Nelson took the two women through the back
door into what was going to be the laboratory

3205
03:06:50,790 --> 03:06:54,521
and advice rooms, and left them to have a
look around.

3206
03:06:54,521 --> 03:06:58,360
Daniel sat on one of the chairs outside by
the wall.

3207
03:06:58,360 --> 03:07:03,870
When Nelson came out, they both sat and watched
the line of teenagers in front of them across

3208
03:07:03,870 --> 03:07:04,970
the yard.

3209
03:07:04,970 --> 03:07:07,400
Daniel took a breath.

3210
03:07:07,400 --> 03:07:12,261
'I saw Viki taking ARVs,' he said.

3211
03:07:12,261 --> 03:07:16,110
Nelson sat motionless and silent.

3212
03:07:16,110 --> 03:07:20,930
'We had a sandwich together this morning,'
Daniel went on.

3213
03:07:20,930 --> 03:07:24,120
'She took some pills afterwards.

3214
03:07:24,120 --> 03:07:28,840
She didn't want us to see her and she said
it was none of my business when I asked about

3215
03:07:28,840 --> 03:07:30,200
them.

3216
03:07:30,200 --> 03:07:33,300
But I'm sure that's what they were.'

3217
03:07:33,300 --> 03:07:37,360
'So she's HIV positive,' said Nelson.

3218
03:07:37,360 --> 03:07:40,351
'That explains a lot.'

3219
03:07:40,351 --> 03:07:44,540
They sat listening to the teenagers singing
for a while.

3220
03:07:44,540 --> 03:07:51,150
The two girls counting packets of biscuits
finished, stood up, and took their boxes inside.

3221
03:07:51,150 --> 03:07:54,190
'Did Viki come to the funeral?'

3222
03:07:54,190 --> 03:07:55,560
Nelson asked.

3223
03:07:55,560 --> 03:07:58,860
'Yeah, she did.'

3224
03:07:58,860 --> 03:07:59,860
Daniel was embarrassed.

3225
03:07:59,860 --> 03:08:01,160
'I was...

3226
03:08:01,160 --> 03:08:04,970
I lost my temper with her afterwards.

3227
03:08:04,970 --> 03:08:10,710
I told her she was using the deaths of babies
to make herself into a TV star.'

3228
03:08:10,710 --> 03:08:12,450
'My God!'

3229
03:08:12,450 --> 03:08:17,090
'She cried, but she did seem to see why I
was hurt.'

3230
03:08:17,090 --> 03:08:19,150
'She did?'

3231
03:08:19,150 --> 03:08:24,091
Nelson hardly dared believe Viki could feel
for others.

3232
03:08:24,091 --> 03:08:26,170
'You must have made quite an impression...'

3233
03:08:26,170 --> 03:08:27,170
Daniel jumped up.

3234
03:08:27,170 --> 03:08:28,170
'I just remembered.

3235
03:08:28,170 --> 03:08:31,771
The funeral was too much for Lily Anne.

3236
03:08:31,771 --> 03:08:35,610
I must ask Sister Michael how she is!'

3237
03:08:35,610 --> 03:08:37,330
He went in.

3238
03:08:37,330 --> 03:08:40,240
Nelson didn't move.

3239
03:08:40,240 --> 03:08:45,570
He shut his eyes and felt tears run down his
face.

3240
03:08:45,570 --> 03:08:50,450
His heart felt as though it was being pressed
between two stones.

3241
03:08:50,450 --> 03:08:54,851
'What's the matter?' said a gentle voice.

3242
03:08:54,851 --> 03:08:56,230
Nelson opened his eyes.

3243
03:08:56,230 --> 03:08:59,980
The gentle voice was Viki's!

3244
03:08:59,980 --> 03:09:02,130
She sat down beside him.

3245
03:09:02,130 --> 03:09:07,479
He sat forward, hesitated; and then took her
hand.

3246
03:09:07,479 --> 03:09:09,580
She didn't pull it away.

3247
03:09:09,580 --> 03:09:14,250
'You're HIV positive,' he said.

3248
03:09:14,250 --> 03:09:16,369
'You guessed.'

3249
03:09:16,369 --> 03:09:19,311
She was looking at their hands.

3250
03:09:19,311 --> 03:09:22,650
'Daniel told me about the ARVs.'

3251
03:09:22,650 --> 03:09:31,600
After a moment Viki said, 'The man I went
with knew he was positive, but he didn't tell

3252
03:09:31,600 --> 03:09:32,600
me.'

3253
03:09:32,600 --> 03:09:34,420
'Have you told him?'

3254
03:09:34,420 --> 03:09:38,520
'I nearly killed him.'

3255
03:09:38,520 --> 03:09:42,030
'But you're still angry,' Nelson stated.

3256
03:09:42,030 --> 03:09:47,310
'I wanted to get married, have kids.

3257
03:09:47,310 --> 03:09:50,310
He's stolen all that.'

3258
03:09:50,310 --> 03:09:53,189
Viki's mouth was a hard line.

3259
03:09:53,189 --> 03:09:55,771
She stared at the fence.

3260
03:09:55,771 --> 03:10:00,470
'So you wouldn't let anyone near you...'

3261
03:10:00,470 --> 03:10:01,920
'What's the use?

3262
03:10:01,920 --> 03:10:06,590
I can't give a man love and children without
killing him.'

3263
03:10:06,590 --> 03:10:09,570
'There are ways...'

3264
03:10:09,570 --> 03:10:11,240
Nelson couldn't meet her eyes.

3265
03:10:11,240 --> 03:10:15,400
'No man wants to bother...'

3266
03:10:15,400 --> 03:10:17,611
'Depends on how much he loves you.'

3267
03:10:17,611 --> 03:10:22,340
He turned and looked at her.

3268
03:10:22,340 --> 03:10:26,320
She didn't answer, her eyes still on the fence.

3269
03:10:26,320 --> 03:10:31,060
'So what are you going to do?' he asked.

3270
03:10:31,060 --> 03:10:32,479
She turned to him.

3271
03:10:32,479 --> 03:10:36,280
'What can I do?

3272
03:10:36,280 --> 03:10:38,180
My job...'

3273
03:10:38,180 --> 03:10:39,960
She paused.

3274
03:10:39,960 --> 03:10:46,730
'... and trying to make sure people know how
to stop themselves getting sick,' Nelson added.

3275
03:10:46,730 --> 03:10:47,730
'Yes.

3276
03:10:47,730 --> 03:10:51,250
Like I said at dinner that night.'

3277
03:10:51,250 --> 03:10:53,860
'I should have guessed...'

3278
03:10:53,860 --> 03:10:54,971
Nelson said.

3279
03:10:54,971 --> 03:10:55,971
'Sorry.'

3280
03:10:55,971 --> 03:11:01,301
'I'm glad you didn't, but I'm sorry too.

3281
03:11:01,301 --> 03:11:05,040
I was very... rude.'

3282
03:11:05,040 --> 03:11:09,141
The faintest smile touched her lips.

3283
03:11:09,141 --> 03:11:14,410
'So was I,' Nelson smiled, 'when I left you
at the hotel!'

3284
03:11:14,410 --> 03:11:16,150
'That was...

3285
03:11:16,150 --> 03:11:18,880
I suppose I deserved that.

3286
03:11:18,880 --> 03:11:20,870
But, you see...

3287
03:11:20,870 --> 03:11:21,960
It's just...

3288
03:11:21,960 --> 03:11:25,400
I'm just so...

3289
03:11:25,400 --> 03:11:27,990
Well...'

3290
03:11:27,990 --> 03:11:32,060
Viki looked down at her hand in Nelson's.

3291
03:11:32,060 --> 03:11:35,350
'So frightened, to tell you the truth.'

3292
03:11:35,350 --> 03:11:42,560
'That's why I was crying just now,' said Nelson.

3293
03:11:42,560 --> 03:11:44,820
'Sorry?'

3294
03:11:44,820 --> 03:11:53,590
'Because I was imagining what it would be
like,' Nelson said very softly, 'to be alone

3295
03:11:53,590 --> 03:11:56,521
and know you were positive.'

3296
03:11:56,521 --> 03:12:01,040
Viki suddenly held Nelson's hand very tight.

3297
03:12:01,040 --> 03:12:04,110
He stood up and pulled her to her feet.

3298
03:12:04,110 --> 03:12:10,910
He put his arms around her and said, 'But
you don't have to be alone.'

3299
03:12:10,910 --> 03:12:14,979
She pushed her face into his chest to hide
her tears.

3300
03:12:14,979 --> 03:12:22,190
They stood still, holding each other in the
sunlight.

3301
03:12:22,190 --> 03:12:28,220
Daniel came out of the door, saw them, and
went straight back in, with a huge grin.

3302
03:12:28,220 --> 03:12:35,200
At last Viki took a deep breath and stood
back from Nelson, wiping her eyes.

3303
03:12:35,200 --> 03:12:40,690
All around them stood a silent circle of watchers,
Daniel and the nurse and Sister Michael among

3304
03:12:40,690 --> 03:12:41,690
them.

3305
03:12:41,690 --> 03:12:43,600
When Viki smiled they all began to clap.

3306
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:52,940
'So you'll be wanting to get on and finish
this film you're making,' said Sister Michael.

3307
03:12:52,940 --> 03:12:53,940
'Yes.

3308
03:12:53,940 --> 03:12:55,920
Of course.'

3309
03:12:55,920 --> 03:12:56,920
Viki laughed.

3310
03:12:56,920 --> 03:12:57,920
'Where's Phil?'

3311
03:12:57,920 --> 03:13:05,021
'He's having a cool drink over by the river,'
said Sister Michael.

3312
03:13:05,021 --> 03:13:08,500
Nelson forced himself to come back to earth
and looked at his watch.

3313
03:13:08,500 --> 03:13:12,340
'I've got to go and meet this businessman
from Australia now.

3314
03:13:12,340 --> 03:13:14,850
I left him to freshen up.

3315
03:13:14,850 --> 03:13:18,810
I'm hoping he's going to buy the Lion Hills
Hotel,' he explained.

3316
03:13:18,810 --> 03:13:22,010
'Daniel, shall I take you into town?

3317
03:13:22,010 --> 03:13:25,210
Do you need to practise for tonight?'

3318
03:13:25,210 --> 03:13:28,520
'I wanted to see Lily Anne...'

3319
03:13:28,520 --> 03:13:29,520
Daniel began.

3320
03:13:29,520 --> 03:13:31,490
'She's sleeping, Daniel.

3321
03:13:31,490 --> 03:13:37,110
She's fine, just very, very tired and sad,'
said Sister Michael.

3322
03:13:37,110 --> 03:13:40,681
'I'll try and bring her to the show this evening.'

3323
03:13:40,681 --> 03:13:44,830
'Then, yes, I'd better get some practice!'

3324
03:13:44,830 --> 03:13:48,561
'The show starts at eight,' said Nelson.

3325
03:13:48,561 --> 03:13:53,630
'Let's all meet up at the football stadium,
at seven thirty.'

3326
03:13:53,630 --> 03:14:00,320
'Kundai said I'd be given eight tickets, so
I'll meet you at Gate H, and give them to

3327
03:14:00,320 --> 03:14:01,721
you.'

3328
03:14:01,721 --> 03:14:03,600
Daniel suddenly couldn't stand still.

3329
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:08,460
He understood how important this evening was
going to be, how important this whole day

3330
03:14:08,460 --> 03:14:09,460
was.

3331
03:14:09,460 --> 03:14:13,280
He found it hard not to start singing now.

3332
03:14:13,280 --> 03:14:19,240
'I'll see you at the truck in five minutes,'
he said to Nelson and ran off to the Chivasa

3333
03:14:19,240 --> 03:14:20,870
house to get his mbira.

3334
03:14:20,870 --> 03:14:24,051
Nelson left Daniel at the football stadium.

3335
03:14:24,051 --> 03:14:29,101
They could hear music and tests being made
on the sound equipment.

3336
03:14:29,101 --> 03:14:31,660
Daniel ran in with a quick word of thanks.

3337
03:14:31,660 --> 03:14:36,280
Nelson took a few minutes to consider what
had happened with Viki.

3338
03:14:36,280 --> 03:14:39,721
He was so excited and happy he could hardly
think.

3339
03:14:39,721 --> 03:14:45,101
If she wanted to be with him as much as he
wanted to be with her, there'd be problems

3340
03:14:45,101 --> 03:14:49,439
because they lived and worked so far apart.

3341
03:14:49,439 --> 03:14:55,890
And there'd be problems eventually because
of her HIV status, though he knew there were

3342
03:14:55,890 --> 03:14:56,890
solutions.

3343
03:14:56,890 --> 03:15:04,280
But for now he only wanted to remember how
it felt to hold and comfort her.

3344
03:15:04,280 --> 03:15:06,630
He'd nearly fainted with happiness.

3345
03:15:06,630 --> 03:15:11,610
'Well, I'd better go and sell a hotel.'

3346
03:15:11,610 --> 03:15:13,051
He laughed to himself.

3347
03:15:13,051 --> 03:15:21,720
'Then I'll have more time to be with her.'

3348
03:15:21,720 --> 03:15:22,720
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

3349
03:15:22,720 --> 03:15:26,180
The show

3350
03:15:26,180 --> 03:15:27,970
'Nelson!'

3351
03:15:27,970 --> 03:15:31,710
shouted the big, soft Australian called Paul
Walker.

3352
03:15:31,710 --> 03:15:37,480
He was sitting in an armchair near reception
at the hotel and had to work hard to stand

3353
03:15:37,480 --> 03:15:38,670
up from it.

3354
03:15:38,670 --> 03:15:41,780
'Hello, Mr Walker,' said Nelson.

3355
03:15:41,780 --> 03:15:44,229
'Please come this way to my office.'

3356
03:15:44,229 --> 03:15:49,430
They went up in the lift to Washington Mbizi's
top-floor office.

3357
03:15:49,430 --> 03:15:54,320
There, Paul Walker looked hard at Nelson.

3358
03:15:54,320 --> 03:15:59,320
'You heard from your father about this deal?'
he asked.

3359
03:15:59,320 --> 03:16:00,550
Nelson was surprised.

3360
03:16:00,550 --> 03:16:02,010
'Only from our lawyer.'

3361
03:16:02,010 --> 03:16:05,820
Paul gave Nelson a sealed envelope.

3362
03:16:05,820 --> 03:16:10,430
'You might want to read this before we get
down to business.'

3363
03:16:10,430 --> 03:16:14,790
Nelson opened the envelope and found a note
to him in his father's handwriting.

3364
03:16:14,790 --> 03:16:18,920
I've discussed the deal for the Lion Hills
with Paul Walker.

3365
03:16:18,920 --> 03:16:24,330
He's agreed on a price I think is good, but
you should check that he doesn't want either

3366
03:16:24,330 --> 03:16:25,971
of the other hotels.

3367
03:16:25,971 --> 03:16:29,920
If he does, make sure he pays for it!

3368
03:16:29,920 --> 03:16:33,190
Tell your mother I'm fine.

3369
03:16:33,190 --> 03:16:34,380
Dad.

3370
03:16:34,380 --> 03:16:36,750
The note was dated three days before.

3371
03:16:36,750 --> 03:16:39,570
'How did you get this?'

3372
03:16:39,570 --> 03:16:40,830
Nelson asked Paul.

3373
03:16:40,830 --> 03:16:43,120
'Saw the man himself.'

3374
03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:44,120
'What?!'

3375
03:16:44,120 --> 03:16:45,120
'Yeah.

3376
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:47,689
He was in our part of the world last week.

3377
03:16:47,689 --> 03:16:48,800
Looked well.

3378
03:16:48,800 --> 03:16:53,540
He's moved on already, so I don't know where
he is now.

3379
03:16:53,540 --> 03:16:57,420
What does he say about the deal?'

3380
03:16:57,420 --> 03:16:58,910
Nelson put the note in his pocket.

3381
03:16:58,910 --> 03:17:04,280
He'd get on the phone to his mother and confirm
that his father was fine in a few minutes,

3382
03:17:04,280 --> 03:17:08,250
but first he said, 'Come and see round the
hotel.

3383
03:17:08,250 --> 03:17:12,630
When you've seen it, we can discuss the price...'

3384
03:17:12,630 --> 03:17:17,810
They went all over the hotel and then sat
down with Fletcher and the hotel manager and

3385
03:17:17,810 --> 03:17:19,470
the account books.

3386
03:17:19,470 --> 03:17:25,300
In the end, Paul was happy and they agreed
a price, but Nelson wanted to make sure all

3387
03:17:25,300 --> 03:17:27,521
the employees would be kept on.

3388
03:17:27,521 --> 03:17:32,760
Paul couldn't promise that, but he said he'd
discuss it with the lawyers at the next stage

3389
03:17:32,760 --> 03:17:36,399
of the sale.

3390
03:17:36,399 --> 03:17:37,399
***

3391
03:17:37,399 --> 03:17:41,700
Viki and Phil got to Gate H at the football
stadium before any of the others, but there

3392
03:17:41,700 --> 03:17:45,110
were already thousands of fans arriving for
the show.

3393
03:17:45,110 --> 03:17:51,270
Viki was happy with the work she and Phil
had done at the Garage and the hospice.

3394
03:17:51,270 --> 03:17:55,020
'You're staying on for a couple of days then?'

3395
03:17:55,020 --> 03:17:56,520
Phil asked.

3396
03:17:56,520 --> 03:17:58,620
Viki raised an eyebrow at him.

3397
03:17:58,620 --> 03:18:04,610
'Seems to me,' he said, 'you might have things
to talk to Nelson about.'

3398
03:18:04,610 --> 03:18:05,610
'Maybe...

3399
03:18:05,610 --> 03:18:12,490
He hasn't said anything - and I'm not sure
how I'm feeling at the moment.'

3400
03:18:12,490 --> 03:18:20,101
'Well, from long experience of working with
you, I'd say you look about the best I've

3401
03:18:20,101 --> 03:18:24,690
ever seen you,' said Phil, his face completely
serious.

3402
03:18:24,690 --> 03:18:26,950
'Oh, Phil!'

3403
03:18:26,950 --> 03:18:27,950
Viki laughed.

3404
03:18:27,950 --> 03:18:28,950
'See?

3405
03:18:28,950 --> 03:18:32,250
Third time you've laughed today.'

3406
03:18:32,250 --> 03:18:33,250
'OK.

3407
03:18:33,250 --> 03:18:39,080
If Nelson isn't too busy and wants me to,
I'll stay on and come back on Monday.

3408
03:18:39,080 --> 03:18:43,140
We have two stories to cover in Durban on
Tuesday, haven't we?'

3409
03:18:43,140 --> 03:18:44,200
'Yup.'

3410
03:18:44,200 --> 03:18:46,090
Daniel appeared at a run.

3411
03:18:46,090 --> 03:18:48,450
'Tickets!' he said and pushed them into Viki's
hand.

3412
03:18:48,450 --> 03:18:49,450
'See you.'

3413
03:18:49,450 --> 03:18:51,521
And he was gone.

3414
03:18:51,521 --> 03:18:54,141
'Good luck,' Phil called after him.

3415
03:18:54,141 --> 03:19:00,830
'Look, Viki, they've said I can film Daniel,
but from the platform with the other cameramen,

3416
03:19:00,830 --> 03:19:02,660
so I'll have to go and get organised.'

3417
03:19:02,660 --> 03:19:03,660
'Fine.

3418
03:19:03,660 --> 03:19:04,660
Go ahead.

3419
03:19:04,660 --> 03:19:06,240
I'll wait for everyone.

3420
03:19:06,240 --> 03:19:09,090
Is there a break in the show?'

3421
03:19:09,090 --> 03:19:10,090
'Yeah.

3422
03:19:10,090 --> 03:19:14,450
Just before Kundai comes on,' Phil said.

3423
03:19:14,450 --> 03:19:17,530
'Can we do a "speaking to the camera" piece
then?'

3424
03:19:17,530 --> 03:19:21,460
'Sure, but you'll have to come to me,' he
warned.

3425
03:19:21,460 --> 03:19:24,010
'It's that big platform thing in the middle.'

3426
03:19:24,010 --> 03:19:26,790
'I'll come there as soon as Daniel's finished.'

3427
03:19:26,790 --> 03:19:28,640
'Right.

3428
03:19:28,640 --> 03:19:30,120
See you.'

3429
03:19:30,120 --> 03:19:36,080
And Phil left her just as Nelson appeared
with Sister Michael, Lily Anne, Eddy and Philomena.

3430
03:19:36,080 --> 03:19:37,439
'Hi, Viki.

3431
03:19:37,439 --> 03:19:43,280
Do we have tickets?' asked Nelson, suddenly
filled with delight at seeing her.

3432
03:19:43,280 --> 03:19:44,320
'Hi.

3433
03:19:44,320 --> 03:19:48,620
Here they are,' she said, unable to meet his
eyes.

3434
03:19:48,620 --> 03:19:53,770
They found their seats and Viki sat at the
end of the row so she could get out to meet

3435
03:19:53,770 --> 03:19:54,920
Phil.

3436
03:19:54,920 --> 03:19:57,470
Nelson sat beside her.

3437
03:19:57,470 --> 03:20:00,800
'How did your meeting go?' she asked him.

3438
03:20:00,800 --> 03:20:05,570
They both sat, their hands between their knees,
looking at the stage.

3439
03:20:05,570 --> 03:20:09,400
'The Australian has agreed a price for the
Lion Hills Hotel.

3440
03:20:09,400 --> 03:20:12,520
He may even consider the other two hotels...'

3441
03:20:12,520 --> 03:20:18,570
'But once it goes through, you'll be free
to work full time for the Garage?'

3442
03:20:18,570 --> 03:20:19,570
Viki asked.

3443
03:20:19,570 --> 03:20:26,021
'Well, not if I still have the two smaller
hotels to run, but freer than now.

3444
03:20:26,021 --> 03:20:30,830
Will Network 10 send you up again for the
opening of the Garage in a couple of weeks?'

3445
03:20:30,830 --> 03:20:33,130
'I'm not sure.'

3446
03:20:33,130 --> 03:20:36,240
Viki closed her eyes and sighed.

3447
03:20:36,240 --> 03:20:38,971
Nelson was looking at Viki's profile.

3448
03:20:38,971 --> 03:20:45,000
He thought she looked too perfect to be true
and he felt as though he owned the world.

3449
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:49,400
'And I wanted to ask you something else.'

3450
03:20:49,400 --> 03:20:50,900
Viki turned to him.

3451
03:20:50,900 --> 03:20:51,900
'Oh?'

3452
03:20:51,900 --> 03:20:58,000
'May I come down to Jo'burg and spend a little
time with you when things are a bit quieter

3453
03:20:58,000 --> 03:20:59,350
here?'

3454
03:20:59,350 --> 03:21:00,610
asked Nelson.

3455
03:21:00,610 --> 03:21:02,610
'Do you really want to?'

3456
03:21:02,610 --> 03:21:03,900
'Not really.

3457
03:21:03,900 --> 03:21:08,070
I'm just making conversation to kill time,'
Nelson joked.

3458
03:21:08,070 --> 03:21:09,410
'Oh!'

3459
03:21:09,410 --> 03:21:12,780
Viki's laughter died quickly.

3460
03:21:12,780 --> 03:21:14,130
'Look.

3461
03:21:14,130 --> 03:21:15,479
Truly.

3462
03:21:15,479 --> 03:21:18,550
Part of me wants to see you more than you
can imagine and...'

3463
03:21:18,550 --> 03:21:21,620
'I doubt it...' said Nelson.

3464
03:21:21,620 --> 03:21:22,960
'... part of me knows it's stupid.

3465
03:21:22,960 --> 03:21:25,080
There's no future...'

3466
03:21:25,080 --> 03:21:26,101
Viki went on.

3467
03:21:26,101 --> 03:21:29,030
'But there is a present.

3468
03:21:29,030 --> 03:21:33,150
Surely we can enjoy that?' said Nelson.

3469
03:21:33,150 --> 03:21:35,979
Viki smiled more happily.

3470
03:21:35,979 --> 03:21:36,979
'OK.

3471
03:21:36,979 --> 03:21:39,189
Let's just enjoy the present.'

3472
03:21:39,189 --> 03:21:41,240
She held out her hand to him.

3473
03:21:41,240 --> 03:21:44,910
He took it in both his and kissed it.

3474
03:21:44,910 --> 03:21:51,650
They sat in silence waiting for the show to
start.

3475
03:21:51,650 --> 03:21:57,710
Two or three singers came and went on the
stage, introduced by a man with a microphone.

3476
03:21:57,710 --> 03:22:01,050
People clapped, but they weren't really interested.

3477
03:22:01,050 --> 03:22:06,200
They'd come to see Kundai and he wasn't on
until after the break.

3478
03:22:06,200 --> 03:22:09,820
The crowd chatted and moved around.

3479
03:22:09,820 --> 03:22:16,150
The man with the microphone came on and said,
'Until a month ago, the next place on the

3480
03:22:16,150 --> 03:22:19,851
programme was filled by Orlando.

3481
03:22:19,851 --> 03:22:23,801
You may know that Orlando died a few days
ago.

3482
03:22:23,801 --> 03:22:27,420
We miss him and thank him for his wonderful
music.'

3483
03:22:27,420 --> 03:22:32,580
The crowd went quiet and there was a short
pause.

3484
03:22:32,580 --> 03:22:39,300
'But now,' said the man, 'we're going to hear
from Daniel Mawadza.

3485
03:22:39,300 --> 03:22:44,010
You may have seen and heard him singing in
the 7th Street Shopping Mall.

3486
03:22:44,010 --> 03:22:48,210
Here he is, at the special invitation of Kundai.

3487
03:22:48,210 --> 03:22:51,000
Give him a big hand.'

3488
03:22:51,000 --> 03:22:55,110
Eddy stood up and called out, 'Go for it,
Dan!'

3489
03:22:55,110 --> 03:22:57,240
Others clapped and whistled.

3490
03:22:57,240 --> 03:22:59,820
Lily Anne just stood up and waited.

3491
03:22:59,820 --> 03:23:05,771
'Good evening, everyone,' came Daniel's voice
over the microphone.

3492
03:23:05,771 --> 03:23:09,770
He was wearing jeans he had borrowed from
Nelson and a plain white T-shirt.

3493
03:23:09,770 --> 03:23:14,990
He was carrying a borrowed guitar and his
mbira.

3494
03:23:14,990 --> 03:23:19,710
He came forward and sat on a small wooden
seat he brought with him.

3495
03:23:19,710 --> 03:23:24,570
'That was our dad's,' said Eddy quietly.

3496
03:23:24,570 --> 03:23:30,479
Daniel laid the guitar down beside him, sat
down with his mbira and said, 'I'll start

3497
03:23:30,479 --> 03:23:36,950
with a quick trip along 7th Street with one
of my favourite ladies.'

3498
03:23:36,950 --> 03:23:38,811
People laughed and clapped.

3499
03:23:38,811 --> 03:23:43,101
His next song was the one about his mother
dying.

3500
03:23:43,101 --> 03:23:46,890
The whole football ground went quiet.

3501
03:23:46,890 --> 03:23:49,790
Some people remembered seeing Daniel on TV.

3502
03:23:49,790 --> 03:23:53,570
They clapped for a long time at the end of
the song.

3503
03:23:53,570 --> 03:23:57,780
'And now, I have a new song.

3504
03:23:57,780 --> 03:24:03,431
It's called "Sometimes you know, but you don't
want to know'".

3505
03:24:03,431 --> 03:24:09,860
Daniel stood up, picked up the guitar and
played louder, happier music.

3506
03:24:09,860 --> 03:24:12,730
Sometimes you know, but you don't want to
know.

3507
03:24:12,730 --> 03:24:15,850
The truth's too sharp, too heavy, too near.

3508
03:24:15,850 --> 03:24:18,240
But you gotta listen so you can hear

3509
03:24:18,240 --> 03:24:21,160
Your heart saying, love's allowed.

3510
03:24:21,160 --> 03:24:22,530
Love's allowed.

3511
03:24:22,530 --> 03:24:23,760
Just don't hate us.

3512
03:24:23,760 --> 03:24:26,021
Love's allowed, whatever your status.

3513
03:24:26,021 --> 03:24:30,330
Even when you know, but you don't want to
know...

3514
03:24:30,330 --> 03:24:35,250
As Daniel finished, the crowd clapped and
called out, and those who were standing in

3515
03:24:35,250 --> 03:24:39,240
the middle of the football field were jumping
up and down.

3516
03:24:39,240 --> 03:24:44,340
Then the man with the microphone shouted,
'Thank you Daniel.

3517
03:24:44,340 --> 03:24:52,980
Now we'll take a break and... in fifteen minutes...
the great, the brilliant, Kundai Kambera will

3518
03:24:52,980 --> 03:24:54,390
be here!'

3519
03:24:54,390 --> 03:24:58,180
The crowd cheered wildly as the lights came
up.

3520
03:24:58,180 --> 03:25:03,760
'I have to meet Phil down at the platform,'
said Viki to Nelson.

3521
03:25:03,760 --> 03:25:07,420
She had tears on her face, but she was laughing.

3522
03:25:07,420 --> 03:25:08,939
'Wasn't Daniel amazing?

3523
03:25:08,939 --> 03:25:14,850
Lily Anne, Eddy, do you want to come and talk
to me on camera about him?'

3524
03:25:14,850 --> 03:25:15,850
'Yeah!'

3525
03:25:15,850 --> 03:25:19,229
they shouted and followed her into the crowd.

3526
03:25:19,229 --> 03:25:21,189
Nelson turned to Sister Michael.

3527
03:25:21,189 --> 03:25:24,160
'He really is good,' he said.

3528
03:25:24,160 --> 03:25:28,680
'How does he know all that stuff about how
people feel?'

3529
03:25:28,680 --> 03:25:30,180
'He watches.

3530
03:25:30,180 --> 03:25:33,360
And of course he feels too.

3531
03:25:33,360 --> 03:25:38,870
Did I hear you telling Viki that the hotel
deal is going through?'

3532
03:25:38,870 --> 03:25:42,050
'Almost certainly, yes.'

3533
03:25:42,050 --> 03:25:44,940
'So how do you feel about that?'

3534
03:25:44,940 --> 03:25:47,530
'Happy that it will mean I'm freer.

3535
03:25:47,530 --> 03:25:50,460
Sad to say goodbye to the hotel...'

3536
03:25:50,460 --> 03:25:58,120
'Well, by that smile on your face, I'd say
the happy wins over the sad.'

3537
03:25:58,120 --> 03:26:00,710
Sister Michael's blue eyes were laughing.

3538
03:26:00,710 --> 03:26:03,140
'Yeah, well...

3539
03:26:03,140 --> 03:26:06,020
That's partly because I learned that my dad's
fine.'

3540
03:26:06,020 --> 03:26:12,400
Philomena, at the other end of their row,
gasped, and hugged her Sunday handbag.

3541
03:26:12,400 --> 03:26:14,000
'That's just perfect.

3542
03:26:14,000 --> 03:26:16,750
Did you tell your mum?'

3543
03:26:16,750 --> 03:26:17,900
'First moment I had alone.'

3544
03:26:17,900 --> 03:26:22,660
'What else is making you smile then, young
Nelson?

3545
03:26:22,660 --> 03:26:26,080
Partly for your dad, and partly for what?'

3546
03:26:26,080 --> 03:26:28,830
'Partly because of Viki,' he said.

3547
03:26:28,830 --> 03:26:32,230
Sister Michael became serious.

3548
03:26:32,230 --> 03:26:34,670
'She's HIV positive, isn't she?'

3549
03:26:34,670 --> 03:26:38,850
'She told you?' asked Nelson in surprise.

3550
03:26:38,850 --> 03:26:40,450
'She did.

3551
03:26:40,450 --> 03:26:43,220
And it'll be hard for you, you know.'

3552
03:26:43,220 --> 03:26:46,790
'Not as hard as living without her,' declared
Nelson.

3553
03:26:46,790 --> 03:26:49,830
'Which in the end you might have to do.'

3554
03:26:49,830 --> 03:26:57,350
'Well, by then, with any luck, we'll have
lots of happy memories - and even a child

3555
03:26:57,350 --> 03:26:58,440
or two.'

3556
03:26:58,440 --> 03:27:01,601
'And so when will that happen, do you suppose?'

3557
03:27:01,601 --> 03:27:05,030
Sister Michael was making fun of him.

3558
03:27:05,030 --> 03:27:09,820
Philomena was pretending not to hear, smiling
broadly at her handbag.

3559
03:27:09,820 --> 03:27:12,540
'Oh, probably tomorrow or the next day.'

3560
03:27:12,540 --> 03:27:13,900
Nelson laughed.

3561
03:27:13,900 --> 03:27:16,689
'Unless of course she decides against it.'

3562
03:27:16,689 --> 03:27:18,380
'You know she won't...

3563
03:27:18,380 --> 03:27:23,080
Look, here are the others coming back again.

3564
03:27:23,080 --> 03:27:25,860
Will I see you soon at the hospice?

3565
03:27:25,860 --> 03:27:28,631
We all have to decide what Lily Anne will
do next.'

3566
03:27:28,631 --> 03:27:30,080
'Of course.'

3567
03:27:30,080 --> 03:27:34,431
Everyone sat down again and prepared to watch
Kundai.

3568
03:27:34,431 --> 03:27:39,290
The crowd was already singing his latest hit
song.

3569
03:27:39,290 --> 03:27:42,790
Viki took hold of Nelson's hand in the dark.

3570
03:27:42,790 --> 03:27:46,960
'Did Daniel know how you felt before you did?'

3571
03:27:46,960 --> 03:27:48,479
she whispered.

3572
03:27:48,479 --> 03:27:54,090
'No, but he knew how you felt before you did!'

3573
03:27:54,090 --> 03:27:56,860
Nelson whispered back.

3574
03:27:56,860 --> 03:28:04,080
She took his face between her hands and said,
'You just be glad he did!'

3575
03:28:04,080 --> 03:28:07,130
And she kissed him.

3576
03:28:07,130 --> 03:28:08,140
Epilogue

3577
03:28:08,140 --> 03:28:17,290
A year later Nelson and Viki's son, Daniel,
was born.

3578
03:28:17,290 --> 03:28:24,300
'Big' Daniel was still at school, but had
made a CD in London and done a tour of concerts

3579
03:28:24,300 --> 03:28:25,490
with Kundai.

3580
03:28:25,490 --> 03:28:28,290
Lily Anne had gone back to school.

3581
03:28:28,290 --> 03:28:34,521
She spent a lot of time at the Garage with
children and teenagers from families affected

3582
03:28:34,521 --> 03:28:36,120
by HIV.

3583
03:28:36,120 --> 03:28:41,920
Eddy was a bus driver when there was work,
but also drove for Nelson.

3584
03:28:41,920 --> 03:28:45,950
The Garage and the hospice often worked together.

3585
03:28:45,950 --> 03:28:53,860
Money came in from other countries and organisations,
partly because of films Viki made about their

3586
03:28:53,860 --> 03:28:54,860
work.

3587
03:28:54,860 --> 03:29:01,500
Viki's doctor said she might live an almost
normal life for many years if she looked after

3588
03:29:01,500 --> 03:29:04,470
herself and went on with the drugs.

3589
03:29:04,470 --> 03:29:11,910
Little Daniel was given the drug that stopped
him getting HIV from Viki, and it worked.

3590
03:29:11,910 --> 03:29:17,360
Ruby joined Washington Mbizi and they moved
from country to country, waiting for a change

3591
03:29:17,360 --> 03:29:18,360
in government in Gomokure.

3592
03:29:18,360 --> 03:29:19,360
***

3593
03:29:19,360 --> 03:29:20,360
According to reports by the United Nations
and the World Health Organisation, the average

3594
03:29:20,360 --> 03:29:23,460
number of people living with HIV in most countries
of Southern Africa rose to between one in

3595
03:29:23,460 --> 03:29:25,400
five and one in four in 2005.

3596
03:29:25,400 --> 03:29:29,000
In some places the figures can be as high
as one in two.

3597
03:29:29,000 --> 03:29:33,160
And the numbers are still rising for people
between the ages of fifteen and forty-nine.

3598
03:29:33,160 --> 03:29:37,601
In the same year there were more than four
million children orphaned by AIDS in southern

3599
03:29:37,601 --> 03:29:38,601
and central Africa.

3600
03:29:38,601 --> 03:29:38,990
- THE END -
