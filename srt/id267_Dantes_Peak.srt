CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,960
Harry Dalton loved volcanoes.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:14,080
He had the most dangerous and exciting job in the world.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,120
He was a scientist, and he wanted to understand volcanoes.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,920
"Volcanoes kill people," he said.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:42,080
"When we understand volcanoes, we can tell people: "This mountain is going to explode", and then they can move away."
He flew round the world.

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,280
Was a volcano ready to explode?

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,800
Harry Dalton was there.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,320
His girlfriend Marianne loved volcanoes too.

10
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:03,960
Then one day in South America they stayed top long near an
exploding volcano.

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,200
The mountain sent rock and ash up into the sky.

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:23,360
A small rock came down on to their car, hit Marianne, and
she died.

13
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,480
Harry was never the same again.

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,480
He worked harder - too hard.

15
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:43,360
He wanted to understand everything about volcanoes before a
volcano killed anybody again.

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:51,440
Marianne was dead: no others must die.

17
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,000
Some months later, his boss, Paul Dreyfus, called him into
his office.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:20,680
"Harry," he said, "you must take a holiday. You're tired. You're not twenty now, you're thirty-six. I'm sorry about
Marianne, but volcanoes are going to explode. You can't stop them."

19
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,280
Harry took a holiday.

20
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,560
He went round the world - but there are volcanoes all round
the world.

21
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,200
So he always found work.

22
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,000
After a year, he came back to the office.

23
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,920
His friends - Terry Furlong.

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,640
Stan Tzima, Nancy Field and Greg Esmail - all smiled when
Harry came back.

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,520
"We knew it," they said.

26
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:59,240
"You love your work. "Harry will come back soon", we said.
And here you are."

27
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:21,600
"Harry," said Paul Dreyfus two or three days later, "something is happening up in the Cascades. Our equipment
shows that one of the mountains there is moving, but not much. Nobody there knows it, but our equipment is good."

28
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,440
"In the Cascades?" Harry said.

29
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,680
"Here in the United States... in Washington?"

30
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:44,080
"That's right. Dante's Peak, near Mount Washington. We all
remember 1980 when Mount St Helen's exploded. Can you go?"

31
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,040
"I'm leaving now," said Harry.

32
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,720
He put some equipment in the back of his off road car, and
drove to Washington.

33
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,880
There were tall trees thick on the mountains.

34
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,000
"It's very beautiful here." Harry thought.

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,400
He saw the morning sun on mountain lakes to the left of the
road.

36
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,280
The mountain stood tall over the small town of Dante's Peak.

37
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,440
Only seven thousand people lived there.

38
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,360
It was quiet

39
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,080
Harry drove to the centre of the town and found the hotel.

40
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,640
Mr Cluster showed him to his room.

41
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:35,520
Then Harry asked, "Where's Mayor Wando? Do you know?"

42
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,000
"Yeah," said Cluster.

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:53,200
"She's speaking to the people of the town today at the school. A newspaper called Dante's Peak "The Second Best
Town in America" and they're giving the newspaper photograph of the town to the people."

44
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,440
CHAPTER TWO

45
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,720
"I'm going to be late," Rachel Wando said.

46
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,320
She ran round her room at home.

47
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,720
"Where's my other shoe?" she said.

48
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,200
"You're always late, Mom," said Lauren, Rachel's
ten-year-old daughter.

49
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,960
Rachel was thirty-five.

50
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,240
"And your shoe is under the bed."

51
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:31,960
"What am I going to say?" Rachel said. ""I want to say thank
you to Karen from the newspaper.

52
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,400
She came here...""

53
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,880
Rachel stopped.

54
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,320
"Is it Karen or Kathy from the newspaper?" she asked.

55
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,640
"For the tenth time, Mom," said Lauren, "she's Karen."

56
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,160
"Where's my good jacket."

57
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,920
"You don't have a good jacket."

58
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,000
"The blue jacket."

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,040
"It's on the back of the chair down in the kitchen."

60
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,840
Rachel ran down to the kitchen.

61
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:09,120
She put on her jacket and then called through the door of
her son's bedroom: "Graham, let's go!"

62
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,640
"He's not in," said Lauren.

63
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,080
"He'll meet us there. He told me. Come on!"

64
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,640
Harry stood quietly in a comer of the room.

65
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,160
Most of the people from the town were there.

66
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:35,840
Les Worrell, the most important businessman in the town, sat
with Karen Narlington from the newspaper.

67
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,920
He looked at the chair next to him.

68
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,960
Where was that woman?

69
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:48,040
Rachel ran into the room and then slowed to a walk.

70
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,000
Les stood up and said.

71
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,160
"And here's the mayor, Rachel Wando."

72
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,520
Harry watched Rachel.

73
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,720
"Wow!" he thought.

74
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,280
"The mayor is a woman... and she's beautiful!"

75
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:13,520
Rachel came up to the front of the room, smiled at Les and
Karen, and sat down in her chair.

76
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,480
First Karen spoke.

77
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Then Rachel stood up, and said: "I want to say thank you to
Kathy from the newspaper..."

78
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,320
"It's Karen," Lauren called from the back of the room.

79
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,800
Everybody laughed.

80
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,360
Rachel smiled.

81
00:07:34,360 --> 00:08:18,320
"We like our town. Now Karen's newspaper likes it too. And people read her newspaper all round America. This is
important for the town of Dante's Peak. So we thank you, Karen. She thinks that Dante's Peak is the second best town in America. We know better. It's the first, the best place to live. And next year, with the help of Elliot Blair, we'll show America. Karen's newspaper will say: "Dante's Peak - the best town in all America.""

82
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,160
She stopped talking and sat down.

83
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:29,520
The people in the room jumped to their feet, with smiles on
their faces.

84
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,720
Harry turned to the man next to him.

85
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,480
"Who's Elliot Blair?" he asked.

86
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,320
"He's a big businessman," the man said.

87
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:53,680
"He wants to bring a lot of money to Dante's Peak. He wants to make the town a centre for people's winter holidays.
There'll be a lot of work for people here."

88
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,480
CHAPTER THREE

89
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,840
Behind the town, up in the mountain, was a famous warm lake.

90
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,120
Swimmers often went there.

91
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:14,560
That day, two visitors, a young man and a young woman,
walked up to the lake for a swim.

92
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,040
The trees were green, the sun was in the sky.

93
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,800
It was quiet and beautiful.

94
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,440
The woman put her foot in the water.

95
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,280
"Ow!" she said.

96
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,720
"It's hot!"

97
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,200
"Yes," said her friend, "I know. The lake is famous."

98
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,640
They laughed, and walked into the water.

99
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,120
They played and swam.

100
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,600
"This is good," said the young woman.

101
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,800
"Do you want to come and live here?"

102
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,520
"No, it's too quiet," said the man.

103
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,200
"Nothing exciting happens."

104
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,640
Suddenly birds flew up from the trees, and they heard the
sound of animals.

105
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,360
"Why are the animals running away?" she asked.

106
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,640
"I don't know," he answered.

107
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,400
He pulled her under the water, and she laughed.

108
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,360
Suddenly, there was a small earthquake.

109
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,440
Now the woman was afraid.

110
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,960
She swam over to the man.

111
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,680
Under the lake rocks moved and the ground opened.

112
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,960
Hot gas exploded into the lake.

113
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,160
She screamed.

114
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,000
"The water!" she cried.

115
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,680
"It's too hot! It's..." They were her last words.

116
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,280
Soon the lake was quiet again.

117
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:56,720
From the school, Rachel went to find her daughter.

118
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:06,840
A tall, darkeyed man walked up to her and said, "Hi! I'm
Harry Dalton, from the United States Volcano Office, and..."

119
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:13,400
But Les Worrell and Elliot Blair came up to Rachel with
smiles on their faces.

120
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,280
"Well done, Rachel!" Les said, before Harry could say
anything more.

121
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,760
"You're a good speaker," Blair said.

122
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,040
"Thank you," Rachel said.

123
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,360
But she didn't want Dalton and Blair to meet.

124
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:38,480
Blair wanted to make Dante's Peak a holiday town, Dalton was
from the Volcano Office.

125
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,600
No, she didn't want them to meet.

126
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,880
Harry tried again.

127
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,920
"I'm Harry Dalton, from..."

128
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,720
"From Portland," Rachel said quickly.

129
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,440
"Yes, your boss spoke to me on the phone. He asked me to
show you round. Let's go."

130
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,000
She took him by the arm and moved him away from Worrell and
Blair.

131
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,200
Lauren came up to them.

132
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,800
"Where's your brother?" Rachel asked.

133
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,320
"I don't know," Lauren said.

134
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,760
"I think I do," Rachel said.

135
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,240
They went over to her car.

136
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,640
"Get in," Rachel said to Harry.

137
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,360
"I must find my thirteen-year-old son first."

138
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,360
They took the road up the mountain.

139
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,680
Rachel told Harry about Blair.

140
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,680
"He's going to be very good for the town," she said.

141
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,440
"Where are we going?" Harry asked.

142
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,600
He wanted to start work.

143
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,760
Rachel stopped the car outside an old mine.

144
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,080
She got out of the car and went over to it.

145
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,600
"Graham!" she called.

146
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,160
"Graham, are you in there?"

147
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,320
A minute later, three boys came out of the mine.

148
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,080
They were dirty.

149
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,920
"You two go home," Rachel said angrily to the other two
boys.

150
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,040
"And you - get in the car!"

151
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,600
Graham looked at Harry.

152
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,760
"Who are you?" he asked.

153
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:35,680
"I'm..." Harry began, but Rachel said: "That mine is dangerous. Rocks can fall. You mustn't go in there. How many
times do I have to tell you?"

154
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,760
"Mom, not now, OK?" Graham said.

155
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
He looked at Harry.

156
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,560
Harry smiled at him.

157
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,640
CHAPTER FOUR

158
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,560
They drove up the mountain.

159
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,800
"Hey, Mom," said Graham.

160
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,520
"Why don't you leave me at Ruth's?"

161
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,600
"Yeah, me too," said Lauren.

162
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,080
"There's no time," Rachel said.

163
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,160
"Mr Dalton wants to start working now."

164
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,080
"Oh, please, Mom," said the children.

165
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,800
"It's OK with me," said Harry.

166
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,920
"Ruth is my husband's mother," Rachel said, "but my husband
left me."

167
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,800
Ruth lived by a cold, clean mountain lake.

168
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,080
They drove up to her small house.

169
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,320
A dog ran out of the house and jumped up at the car.

170
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,840
"Hi, Roughy!" Lauren said through the window.

171
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,400
They all got out of the car.

172
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,240
Graham took an old shoe and threw it for Roughy.

173
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,040
The dog ran into the trees after it.

174
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,840
Lauren ran over to the house.

175
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,000
Hello, where are you?" she called.

176
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:25,120
An older woman came out of the house with a big smile on her face. She wore a shirt and jeans. "Hi!" she said. The
children ran over to her, but Rachel walked slowly. "Hello, Ruth," she said.

177
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,840
Ruth looked at Harry. "Is this your boyfriend?" she asked.

178
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:39,120
Harry answered. "No," he said. "I'm from the United States
Volcano Office.

179
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,400
I want to look at your mountain."

180
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:48,920
"Yeah, people came here in 1980, after Mount St Helen's,"
said Ruth.

181
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,560
"There wasn't a problem with this mountain then, and there
isn't now."

182
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Harry looked round at the lake.

183
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,960
There were brown, dead trees by the water.

184
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,520
"When did those trees die?" he asked.

185
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,520
"Trees are always dying," Ruth said.

186
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,240
"Then new trees come. We had a bad winter."

187
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,680
Harry took some equipment out of his bag and went over to
the lake.

188
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,680
Graham followed him.

189
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,560
"What are you doing?" he asked.

190
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Harry said: "This equipment will answer the question: How
much acid is there in the lake?" He looked at the equipment.

191
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,440
There was too much acid.

192
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,400
He put his finger into the water.

193
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,080
Not good.

194
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,200
He went back to the car.

195
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:54,320
"I'm going to take Mr Dalton up to the warm lake," Rachel
said to Ruth.

196
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,720
"Can the children stay here?"

197
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,120
"Yes, but why don't we all go?" said Ruth.

198
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,560
"Yeah," said Graham.

199
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,440
"We can go for a swim."

200
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,040
The children ran over to the car.

201
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,120
Rachel looked angrily at Ruth.

202
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,520
Harry smiled.

203
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,120
"These two women don't like being together," he thought.

204
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:27,360
In the car, Rachel asked about the acid in the water.

205
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,720
"It's not good," Harry said.

206
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,800
"Do we have a problem?" she asked.

207
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,960
"Will the mountain explode?"

208
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,680
"I don't know," he answered.

209
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:55,680
"Often nothing happens. People hear sounds under the ground,
there are earthquakes, trees die, there's acid in the water- and then nothing happens."

210
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,080
Rachel stopped the car near the warm lake.

211
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,840
The children jumped out of the car.

212
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,440
"Come on!" they cried.

213
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,840
"Let's go!"

214
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,840
"Wait for me!" Rachel called.

215
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,400
"Oh, they'll be OK," Ruth said.

216
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,680
She followed the children.

217
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,120
Harry started getting equipment out of the car.

218
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,640
Suddenly Lauren screamed.

219
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,400
Rachel ran through the trees.

220
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,960
Harry followed.

221
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,600
"Look!" Lauren cried.

222
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,880
On the ground at her feet were two dead animals.

223
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,680
"There are a lot of those round here this year," Ruth said.

224
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,320
"Do you think they're ill?"

225
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,000
The children went over to the lake.

226
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,640
Graham stood on a rock.

227
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,040
He wanted to jump in.

228
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,680
Suddenly Harry called, "Stop".

229
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:08,840
"There was a lot of gas. "There are some dead fish on the
water," he said, "and there's something bigger too.

230
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,440
What is it?"

231
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,240
Children can see things better.

232
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,920
Lauren screamed again.

233
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,800
"A man and a woman. There, face down, in the water!"

234
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,400
CHAPTER FIVE

235
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,120
Some men from the hospital carried the swimmers away.

236
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,960
Harry was on the phone to Paul Dreyfus.

237
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,480
"Yes, there is a problem here," he said.

238
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,520
"Send everyone - and the robot."

239
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,280
He listened to Paul's answer.

240
00:19:49,320 --> 00:20:02,600
"Yes, I know about the money," he said, "but we're talking about people here. Two people are dead." He put his phone
away.

241
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,280
"Are you OK?" he asked the children.

242
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,200
"Yes," they said.

243
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,600
"Who were those swimmers?" Harry asked.

244
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,040
"Do you know?"

245
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,080
"They weren't from the town," Rachel said.

246
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:26,480
"I think they were visitors. Do we have a big problem here,
Harry?"

247
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,600
"I don't know. I must talk to the most important people in
the town."

248
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,840
"OK," Rachel said.

249
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,000
"I'm the mayor. I'll tell them you want to meet them."

250
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,640
They met that evening.

251
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:53,280
Eight people were in the room - Harry, Rachel, Les Worrell,
and five other men and women from the town.

252
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,000
Harry and Rachel told the others about the swimmers and the
acid in the lake.

253
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:05,040
"But this volcano is dead," said Sheriff Turner.

254
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,280
"The last explosion was seven thousand years ago."

255
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,280
"No, it's sleeping, not dead," Harry said.

256
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,400
"And I think it's starting to be dangerous again now."

257
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:31,520
"Mr Dalton," Les Worrell said, "you want to move over seven thousand people from their homes. They aren't going to like
that."

258
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,440
"That's right," said two or three of the others.

259
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,040
"Do you want people to die?" Harry asked.

260
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,360
"Do you know that people will die?" Les said.

261
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:54,400
"No, I don't know. But I want people to be ready to move
out."

262
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,720
"And what about Elliot Blair?" Les said.

263
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,720
"What will we say when he asks, "Why are people leaving?

264
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,280
Is there a problem with the town?"

265
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,200
Mr Dalton, do you think that he'll put money into the town
after that?"

266
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,000
Everybody in the room started talking at the same time.

267
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,240
Suddenly, Paul Dreyfus walked into the room.

268
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,960
"Paul!" said Harry.

269
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,640
"You're here. Did you bring...?"

270
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:39,440
"Yes," Paul said" I brought everything. We're staying at the hotel and our office will be there. Now, what's happening
here?"

271
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:54,280
"Everybody," called Harry," this is my boss, Paul Dreyfus. Paul, I want the people in the town to be ready to leave.
We're talking about it now."

272
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,800
Paul looked at the others.

273
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,880
He said, "Harry come with me."

274
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,040
He took Harry outside.

275
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,920
"This isn't right," he said.

276
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:15,600
"You're a scientist. You don't know that the volcano will
explode."

277
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,000
"Two people are dead," Harry said.

278
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,920
"How many more people must die?"

279
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:48,160
"There's some acid in the water, there are some dead trees and animals. Why do you think "Volcano!"? There are
earthquakes, and you get acid in the water. You know that. I think that there was one earthquake, and that's all. I don't think the volcano is going to explode."

280
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,200
"But, Paul..."

281
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,320
"No," Paul said.

282
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,520
"I'm the boss. I think you're wrong."

283
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,800
He turned and went back into the room.

284
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:42,240
When Harry was there too, Paul said, "Everybody, Harry Dalton is a good man. He only wanted to help, but I don't
think the volcano will explode. Don't say anything to other people in the town. We don't want them to be afraid. The other scientists and I will stay here for a week or two. We'll take our equipment up into the mountain. When we know anything, I'll tell you. But I don't think we'll find any danger."

285
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,160
The businessmen were very happy.

286
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,360
Then they turned angrily to Rachel.

287
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,200
"That was a mistake, Rachel," they said.

288
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,320
"Why did you get us all in here? We don't want Blair to hear
about it."

289
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,840
Rachel looked at Dreyfus and Harry.

290
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,520
Which of them was right?

291
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,600
CHAPTER SIX

292
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,680
Dreyfus and Harry walked over to Stein's Bar.

293
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,800
"I want you out of here," Dreyfus said.

294
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:30,600
"Take a holiday... now! Goodbye. I'll see you in two weeks."

295
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,160
"No," said Harry.

296
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,560
"I won't go. I'm your best man, and this town has problems."

297
00:25:40,560 --> 00:26:04,120
"Yes," said Paul, "you are my best man. But you must understand something. After we go, the people here in
Dante's Peak will stay. They have their shops and their businesses. You think only about volcanoes, but this is about money too."

298
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,480
"OK," Harry said with a smile.

299
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,760
"I understand."

300
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,920
"OK," said Paul.

301
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:30,760
"Tomorrow we'll get a helicopter I want you to fly round the peak with your equipment. What's happening? Why? You find
the answers, and then you come and tell me."

302
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:41,920
"Right," Harry said, "I'll do that." Then he turned away and
had a drink with Terry Furlong and the others.

303
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:49,000
The next morning Harry went into the Blue Moon Cafe for
breakfast.

304
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,320
This was Rachel's cafe.

305
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,000
She smiled at him.

306
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,400
"Coffee?" she asked.

307
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,040
"Yes, please," he said.

308
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:09,960
"I'm sorry about yesterday I only wanted to help. I'm better
with volcanoes than I am with business people."

309
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:22,680
"I know you wanted to help," Rachel put the coffee back on the warmer, turned and said, "Do you want to come to dinner
tonight? I want to say thank you."

310
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,440
"Thank you? What for?"

311
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,480
"You stopped Graham jumping into that water."

312
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:38,800
"OK. Yes, please. I do want to have dinner with you."

313
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:45,080
Later in the morning, Harry and Terry went out in the
helicopter.

314
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,880
They took a lot of equipment and flew round the peak.

315
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,800
Terry watched the equipment.

316
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,200
"There's some gas," he said.

317
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,960
"But not a lot."

318
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:07,920
They couldn't see under the helicopter, so they didn't see
it: the ground suddenly gave a strong push.

319
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,880
Big rocks fell down the mountain.

320
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,560
Then everything was quiet again.

321
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,080
The mountain waited.

322
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:26,480
After dinner that evening at Rachel's house, Harry and
Rachel sat outside.

323
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,320
They looked at the lights of the town.

324
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,800
"I know it's a little town," she said.

325
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:40,320
"I know it's not important. But I love it here. It's my
home."

326
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,400
"Were you born here?" Harry asked.

327
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
"Yes."

328
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,880
"And... um... you lived with your husband here?"

329
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,120
"Yes." She was quiet for a moment.

330
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:15,160
"Brian and I were too young when we met. That was the problem. He left about six years ago. He never writes or
anything. The children don't remember him. I don't think he writes to Ruth."

331
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,680
"But you're OK," he said.

332
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:28,480
"Yeah, I am... now. What about you? No wife?"

333
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:42,200
"No. I move round the world all the time. There was somebody
at one time, but..." He told her about Marianne.

334
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,440
"I'm sorry," Rachel said.

335
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,000
"Volcanoes are dangerous," said Harry.

336
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,360
"People must know that."

337
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:00,840
"Perhaps you're wrong about our volcano," said Rachel.

338
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,040
"But I'm happy that you're here to help."

339
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:12,520
CHAPTER SEVEN

340
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:18,480
The next day Harry, Stan and Terry went up the mountain.

341
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,080
They left equipment here and there, near the peak.

342
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,080
"Now we'll know when the ground moves," Stan said.

343
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,040
"We can see it on our equipment in the office at the hotel."

344
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:41,440
"Yeah," said Terry, "when a bird jumps on to the ground,
we'll know it. How was dinner last night, Harry?"

345
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,520
Harry didn't say anything.

346
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:50,160
"For a mayor, she's very beautiful," said Terry.

347
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,720
Harry didn't say anything.

348
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Terry smiled.

349
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,520
Terry Furlong built robots.

350
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:23,600
"We can't get inside volcanoes," he said, "but my little robots can. They can see for us, find gases and smoke for
us. How hot is it? How dangerous is it? My robots can tell us. We can sit in the office, turn on our equipment, and see with the robot's eyes."

351
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:31,280
Two days later, they put Terry's robot in the car park and
turned it on.

352
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,120
It walked for a few metres.

353
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,720
"Yeah, come on, robot!" called Terry.

354
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,360
The robot stopped.

355
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,360
"Is there a problem?" asked Paul.

356
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,160
"No," said Terry.

357
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,320
He went over to the robot and kicked it.

358
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,560
The robot started again.

359
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,280
"It will be OK on the peak," said Terry.

360
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,800
They went to Rachel's cafe for coffee.

361
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,320
She knew them all well now.

362
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,480
"One black coffee," she said, "two with only milk, and two
with sugar too."

363
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,280
She gave them their coffees.

364
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:19,480
Then she asked, "What's happening? What are you finding?"

365
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:27,040
"Our equipment shows that every day there are between
twenty-five and seventy-five earthquakes," Nancy said.

366
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,240
"What?" cried Rachel.

367
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,120
Harry laughed.

368
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,560
"It's OK," he said.

369
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:44,440
"Nothing dangerous is happening. There are always small earthquakes. We can see them with our equipment, but they're
not dangerous."

370
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:51,680
The next day Terry and Harry took the robot to the peak and
sent it inside the old volcano.

371
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:59,360
The robot's "eyes" sent pictures back to their equipment,
and back to the equipment in the hotel too.

372
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,280
The robot walked on.

373
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,280
Suddenly it stopped.

374
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,840
"Oh, no!" said Terry.

375
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,120
He started to go after it.

376
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,240
"Be careful!" Harry said.

377
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,600
Terry climbed down into the old volcano.

378
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,080
He put his feet down carefully on the ground.

379
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,880
Good!

380
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,280
It was hard.

381
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,160
He walked on.

382
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,800
Back at the hotel, everybody watched the robot's pictures.

383
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,120
They didn't look at their other equipment.

384
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,240
Terry found the robot and kicked it.

385
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,960
The robot started moving again.

386
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,280
"OK, Terry, come back now," Harry said on his radio.

387
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,400
Terry didn't listen.

388
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,880
He followed the robot down inside the mountain.

389
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,520
Back in the hotel, Nancy stood up.

390
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,760
She turned round.

391
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,040
"Oh, no!" she said.

392
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,240
"Look at this equipment!"

393
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,960
The others turned round.

394
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,760
"A strong earthquake is happening," she said.

395
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,480
Paul called Harry on the radio.

396
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,720
"Come back now," he said.

397
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,080
"What did you say?" asked Harry.

398
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,120
"I couldn't hear you."

399
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,400
"I said, "Come back now,"" Paul said.

400
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,280
"Earthquake!"

401
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,920
But it was too late.

402
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:42,600
Ten metres above Terry, a large rock broke away and fell on
Terry and the robot.

403
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:51,480
Harry screamed into his radio: "Terry! Terry!" But no answer
came.

404
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,920
The rocks broke two of the robots "eyes".

405
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,960
Back in the hotel they couldn't see very well.

406
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,920
Paul said, "Harry, what's happening?"

407
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,960
"Get that helicopter up here now!" Harry said.

408
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,880
He started to climb down into the volcano.

409
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,000
Some more rocks fell near him.

410
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,320
There were rocks all round, but where was Terry?

411
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,000
Then he saw the colours of Terry's shirt.

412
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,720
He pulled some rocks away.

413
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,480
Terry looked up at him and smiled.

414
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,240
"There's something wrong with my leg," he said.

415
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,480
Harry looked.

416
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,880
"The rocks broke Terry's leg," he said into the radio.

417
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,080
"Tell the helicopter man, Hutcherson, to bring some help."

418
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Before long, Harry could hear the helicopter.

419
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,960
He spoke to Hutcherson on the radio.

420
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,280
"Nearer! Nearer!" he called.

421
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,080
But now there was smoke coming out of the old volcano.

422
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,400
Hutcherson was afraid.

423
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,280
"I'm not coming any nearer than that!" he said.

424
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,360
"You must!" Harry said.

425
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,960
"Only fifteen more metres! Down! Down!"

426
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,240
Slowly the helicopter came nearer.

427
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:33,040
It pulled Terry and Harry inside and flew off down the
mountain.

428
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:43,520
CHAPTER EIGHT

429
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,040
The helicopter came down near the town.

430
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,960
"Look," Terry said to Harry.

431
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,600
"A lot of people are waiting for us. We're famous!"

432
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,280
Harry smiled but said nothing.

433
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Doctors took Terry to hospital.

434
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,680
Rachel pushed through the people and came up to Harry.

435
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,400
"Are you OK?" she said.

436
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,080
"Yeah, I'm OK," he said.

437
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,960
Paul Dreyfus drove up in his car.

438
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,440
"I must go and talk to Paul," Harry said to Rachel.

439
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,520
"How's Terry?" Paul asked.

440
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,800
"He'll be OK," Harry said.

441
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:38,600
"But listen, Paul. We have a problem. That volcano's getting
ready to explode."

442
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,360
Dreyfus stopped smiling.

443
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:52,160
"I know it was hard for you up there, Harry," he said, "but
you mustn't get excited. Not a lot happened."

444
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,160
"Not a lot happened?" said Harry.

445
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,560
"Paul, I was there. That was a big earthquake."

446
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,840
"But the mountain didn't explode," Paul said.

447
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:12,440
"Terry was unlucky, that's all. Those rocks were weak."

448
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,680
"No, Paul, listen," Harry said.

449
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:23,200
"I think the lava is moving up nearer to the ground. The
ground is too warm up there."

450
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,000
"No, you listen, Harry," said Paul angrily.

451
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:42,320
"You lost Marianne. Now you're always afraid. Well, I'm sorry about Marianne, but I don't want people in Dante's
Peak to be afraid because you lost her."

452
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:48,200
The two men started to fight, but Greg pulled Harry away.

453
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,960
"Careful, Harry," he said.

454
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,040
Dreyfus walked away.

455
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,840
"Two more days," he told them.

456
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:04,840
"We'll stay only two more days. There's nothing more for us
to do here."

457
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,600
Three days later, they were ready to leave.

458
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,400
In the evening, Harry went to Stein's Bar.

459
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,200
Terry was back from the hospital.

460
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,840
He was in the bar with Nancy, Greg and Stan.

461
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:27,280
Harry met Rachel there, and they went to a quiet table in a
comer with their drinks.

462
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:33,800
"Perhaps you'll come down to Portland one day, and we'll
meet again," he said.

463
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:39,120
"I usually have a lot of things to do," said Rachel.

464
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,760
"Don't you take holidays?" he asked.

465
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:55,000
"Holidays? Oh, yes, I remember holidays. You have holidays when you don't have two children and a cafe, and aren't
mayor of a town."

466
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,040
Paul Dreyfus came over to their table.

467
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,200
"Can I sit down?" he said.

468
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,760
"Yes," they answered.

469
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:15,560
"Before we leave," Paul said to Rachel, "I want to say thank
you, Mayor Wando. You'll be happy to see us go."

470
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,000
"Yes," said Harry.

471
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,120
He looked at Elliot Blair and Les Worrell.

472
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,600
They sat together at a table.

473
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,960
"Our visit here was bad for business, I think."

474
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,840
Worrell and Blair came over too.

475
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:39,760
Les said, "I told Mr Blair, "Look, the volcano people are
leaving.

476
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,880
There can't be any danger here."

477
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,920
Am I right?"

478
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:53,560
Elliot Blair said, "Yeah. I want to put eighteen million
dollars into Dante's Peak, not Pompeii."

479
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,840
Paul laughed.

480
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,640
"No, there's no danger." Then he turned to Harry.

481
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:08,680
"You're a scientist, Harry. Can you say that it's dangerous
here?"

482
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,280
Dreyfus waited.

483
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,160
Blair and Worrell looked at Harry.

484
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:21,120
Then Harry said, No, I can't."

485
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Dreyfus smiled.

486
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,840
"Come over to the bar," he said to Blair and Worrell.

487
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,240
"I'll buy you two a drink."

488
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:38,960
A minute later Rachel said, "It's getting late. I must go
home to the children."

489
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,880
"I'll walk with you," Harry said.

490
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,400
They got up and left.

491
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,560
The lake near Ruth's home was quiet and dark.

492
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,280
But under the ground a lot of acid flowed into it.

493
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,240
Fish died.

494
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:04,960
First one fish, then ten, twenty, a hundred...

495
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,640
CHAPTER NINE

496
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,640
It was a beautiful night.

497
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,080
Rachel and Harry walked down the street through the centre
of town.

498
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:25,000
"What time are you going tomorrow?" she asked.

499
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,920
"Six o"clock in the morning," he said.

500
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,960
"I'm sorry you're leaving," she said.

501
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,680
"It's OK," he said. "Our equipment is here.

502
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,320
We can sit in Portland and answer the question: "What's
happening in Dante's Peak?" No problem."

503
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,280
"I know," she said.

504
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,560
"But I'm sorry you have to go."

505
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,520
Harry turned to Rachel, and she turned to him.

506
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,040
He put his arms round her.

507
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,080
Then a car drove down the street.

508
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,280
The driver slowed the car near them.

509
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,520
"Good evening, Rachel," a woman said.

510
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,320
Then she drove away.

511
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,720
"Jeannie Lane," Rachel said.

512
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,560
"She'll talk about this for the next two weeks."

513
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,080
They walked to her house.

514
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:29,080
When they were there she said, "Do you want to come in for
coffee or something?"

515
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,600
"Yes," he said.

516
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:39,840
Inside, she fell into his arms, but suddenly Lauren called
from her bedroom.

517
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,800
"Mommy, is that you? I'm thirsty."

518
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,200
"I'll bring you a glass of water," Rachel said.

519
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,840
She went into the kitchen.

520
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,640
"Oh, look," she called.

521
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,360
"The water is coming out all brown."

522
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,240
Harry ran into the kitchen.

523
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,200
He looked at the water.

524
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,160
"Where does the town's water come from?" he asked.

525
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,960
"About eight kilometres away, up the mountain," said Rachel.

526
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,120
"We have to go there, now," Harry said.

527
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,040
"Get the children."

528
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,240
They drove fast up the mountain road.

529
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,200
The sleepy children were in the back of the car.

530
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,840
"Here we are," said Rachel, and stopped the car.

531
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,480
Harry got out.

532
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,320
He and Rachel went over to the water.

533
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,440
It was all brown.

534
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,040
Harry walked round.

535
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,640
"There's gas all round here," he said.

536
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,880
They drove quickly back to town.

537
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,520
It was midnight.

538
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,680
Harry hit the door of Paul's hotel room.

539
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,320
When he opened the door, Harry went inside.

540
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,120
"What's happening?" said Paul.

541
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,040
"Look," said Harry.

542
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,280
He turned on the water in Paul's bathroom.

543
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:10,280
An hour later, all the scientists were back in their office
hard at work.

544
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:20,520
"The earthquakes are stronger now," Harry said early the
next morning."2.3 or 2.4 every time."

545
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,040
"There's a lot of gas too," Stan said.

546
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,400
"This mountain is ready to explode," said Nancy.

547
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,840
Paul Dreyfus put down the phone.

548
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,640
"More police are coming," he said.

549
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,040
"They'll be here by midnight."

550
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,760
Stan called over to Harry, "How much time do you think we've
got?"

551
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,600
"I don't know," Harry said.

552
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,680
He looked at Dreyfus.

553
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:56,440
Dreyfus said, "Ask Mayor Wando to tell the people of the
town to be ready to leave."

554
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:04,080
At six in the evening, Rachel, Harry and the two children
were in the cafe.

555
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,320
Rachel was on the phone.

556
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:19,160
"Ruth," she said for the fifth time, "you must come down to the town now. It's dangerous. We're going to leave. You must
come with us."

557
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,560
"I'm not leaving," Ruth said.

558
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,120
She looked out of the window at the trees and the lake.

559
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,240
"This is my home." She put down the phone.

560
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,560
Rachel went to the school.

561
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,160
The townspeople waited there for her.

562
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,280
"You must leave your homes," she said.

563
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,120
"Some of you will find it hard, but you must."

564
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,320
Elliot Blair got up and left the room.

565
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,640
Les Worrell watched him go.

566
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,840
He could do nothing.

567
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,400
"Must we wait, Rachel?" a young woman asked.

568
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,320
"Can we leave now?"

569
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,200
"Yes," Rachel said.

570
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,720
"Leave now."

571
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,600
Ten or twelve other people stood up and left the room.

572
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,720
Harry Dalton got up to speak.

573
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:23,520
"We're asking you to be ready to leave," he said, "because we don't want to see anything bad happen. But we don't want
you to be afraid."

574
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,120
But then the school building moved.

575
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,120
People jumped up out of their chairs.

576
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,920
Somebody screamed.

577
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,560
Everybody ran for the doors.

578
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:40,680
Out on the street they looked up at the mountain.

579
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,760
The volcano threw ash and smoke and gases up into the sky.

580
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,280
People ran through the town.

581
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,680
Children screamed for their mothers and fathers.

582
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:57,400
At Rachel's house Graham saw the mountain through the
window.

583
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,200
"Lauren!" he called.

584
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,320
"Let's go! We're leaving now!"

585
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,920
At the hotel Dreyfus looked at the equipment.

586
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,720
"The lava is starting to move," he said.

587
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,480
"Don't look at the equipment," Nancy said.

588
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,200
"Look out of the window."

589
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,640
The smoke from the peak was dark.

590
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,720
It was lava ash.

591
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:29,800
"Dante's Peak is going to be more dangerous than Mount St
Helen's," Paul said.

592
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,520
"And the explosion will come soon."

593
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:37,600
CHAPTER TEN

594
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:42,320
Outside, Rachel and Harry looked at the mountain.

595
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,360
"You were right," she said.

596
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,040
A building fell on to the school bus.

597
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,040
"I must go home. I must get the children," Rachel said.

598
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,200
"Let's take my car," said Harry.

599
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,280
They ran over to his off-road car.

600
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,000
They had to push through a lot of people.

601
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,720
There were earthquakes all the time now.

602
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,040
Buildings fell, windows broke.

603
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,520
The road broke open and a car drove into it.

604
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,920
Harry spoke on the radio.

605
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,240
"Paul, are you there?"

606
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,760
"Yes," said Paul.

607
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:28,440
"We're at the hotel. We're taking the equipment and leaving.
Where are you?"

608
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,680
"I'm with Rachel. We're going to get her children."

609
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:39,840
"Harry," said Paul, "I'm sorry. You were right and I was
wrong."

610
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,320
"Forget it, Paul," Harry said.

611
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,560
"See you soon!" He turned off the radio.

612
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:51,600
But when they came to Rachel's house, she screamed.

613
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,560
"My car!" she said.

614
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,440
"It's not here!"

615
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,560
She ran into the house.

616
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:03,000
"Here's a letter from Graham," she cried.

617
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,600
"He says he wants to get Ruth! He's driving up the
mountain!"

618
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,640
Harry fought through the other cars.

619
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,640
He couldn't drive across the river by the road, because
there were too many cars.

620
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,720
The water in the river flowed strongly.

621
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,280
"We can do it in this car," he said.

622
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,640
He drove into the river.

623
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,600
The water pulled at them, but Harry's car got through.

624
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:34,400
Other cars began to follow, but were not as lucky.

625
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,960
The water turned them over.

626
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,640
Behind them, the garage exploded in the town, and fires
started.

627
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,880
In the hotel Greg looked at his equipment.

628
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,960
"The lava is coming up," he said.

629
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,400
"It's very near the ground now."

630
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,000
Some people waited outside the hotel.

631
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,880
"Why are these people here?" asked Nancy.

632
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,600
"The helicopter's coming for them," Paul said.

633
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,280
Now the people could hear the sound of the helicopter in the
night sky.

634
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,960
Hutcherson brought the helicopter down by the hotel.

635
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,680
He opened the door and looked at all the people.

636
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,200
"Eleven people only," he said.

637
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,400
"No more than eleven."

638
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:29,120
Elliot Blair, Les Worrell and some others took out a lot of
money.

639
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,040
They paid Hutcherson, and smiled.

640
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,040
"We'll get out of here," Les said to Blair.

641
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:43,600
In the hotel, Paul said, "Why is Hutcherson flying out? It's
too dangerous."

642
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,720
He ran outside, but it was too late.

643
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,240
The helicopter left the ground.

644
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,880
"They paid him fifteen thousand dollars each," somebody
said.

645
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,560
"Stop! Stop!" called Paul.

646
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:07,600
"There's too much ash. You can't fly in all that ash." But
nobody in the helicopter heard him.

647
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,360
He watched the helicopter.

648
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,520
It flew over the town.

649
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,440
With twelve people in it, it flew slowly.

650
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,200
It was heavy.

651
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,720
It flew into a lot of ash.

652
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:28,200
The ash got inside the engine, and suddenly the engine
stopped.

653
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:34,520
Harry drove the car past the last buildings of the town.

654
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,280
Suddenly he stopped the car.

655
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:45,160
The helicopter hit the mountain on their right, fell across
the road in front of them, and exploded.

656
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,400
Harry spoke into his radio.

657
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,560
"A helicopter is down on Exeter Street. Send help."

658
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,840
"OK, Harry," said Stan.

659
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,440
"What are you doing? Where are you?"

660
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,080
"We're driving up the mountain," Harry said.

661
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,600
"We must get Rachel's children." He turned off the radio.

662
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,640
"Harry, listen to me," Stan said.

663
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:20,800
"There's no time, Harry. Come back. The lava..." But there
was no answer from the radio.

664
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,800
CHAPTER ELEVEN

665
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,240
The lights were on in Ruth's house.

666
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,040
Graham stopped the car in front of it.

667
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,000
The children jumped out and ran to the house.

668
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,240
Ruth came out of the front door with Roughy.

669
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,080
"What are you doing here?" she asked.

670
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,160
"We came to get you and Roughy out," they said.

671
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,360
"What?" she said.

672
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,680
"Get in the car," Graham said.

673
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,360
He pulled her hand.

674
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,800
A sudden strong earthquake moved the ground.

675
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,320
Roughy ran into the trees.

676
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,600
Lauren ran after her.

677
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,440
"Roughy! Roughy!" she called.

678
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,400
Harry and Rachel drove up the road.

679
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,840
"Not far now," Rachel said.

680
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,040
Then the strong earthquake hit them too.

681
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,520
Big rocks fell into the road behind them.

682
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,640
Rachel looked at Harry.

683
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,400
"Now we can't come back down this road," she said.

684
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:35,200
In the dark trees Ruth and the children called for Roughy.

685
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,160
Ruth got tired.

686
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,280
She stopped calling.

687
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,560
She heard the children.

688
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,320
They were young.

689
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,240
"I must get them out of here," she thought.

690
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:53,000
"Ruth, can you see Roughy?" said Lauren.

691
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,640
"No, I can't," Ruth said.

692
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,520
"And it's too late now. We must go. Now."

693
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,600
"But we can't leave her!"

694
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,600
The children looked at Ruth.

695
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,240
She was different, stronger.

696
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,800
"I said now," she said.

697
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:19,840
Harry stopped the car outside Ruth's house.

698
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,320
They saw Rachel's car there.

699
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,600
Rachel jumped out and ran into the house.

700
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,560
"Ruth! Graham! Lauren!" she called.

701
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,040
There was no answer.

702
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,640
"Where are they?" said Harry.

703
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,440
"The lights are on."

704
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,560
Then Ruth and the children came out of the trees.

705
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,600
Rachel ran over to them.

706
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,000
She put her arms round them.

707
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,640
"Where were you?" she said.

708
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,200
"I'm angry and happy at the same time."

709
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,000
"I'm sorry, Mom," said Graham.

710
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,280
"We had to get Ruth."

711
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,400
"There's no time for this now," said Ruth.

712
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,800
"Get the children into the car and get out of here."

713
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,680
"We can't do that," Harry said.

714
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:15,320
"There are rocks all over the road behind us. And you're
coming with us."

715
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,520
"OK," said Ruth.

716
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,880
"Give me five minutes. I must get some things."

717
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:28,040
Harry spoke on the radio to the scientists at the hotel.

718
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,240
"Is anybody there?" he asked.

719
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,320
"Harry, where are you?" said Dreyfus.

720
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,120
"Up at the lake," Harry said.

721
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:42,880
"We're OK, but there's no road for us to come back down the
mountain."

722
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:51,280
"Harry," Paul said, "this mountain is going to explode...
and soon. I'll send a helicopter up to get you."

723
00:56:51,280 --> 00:57:00,480
"No, get out of there," Harry said, "before it's too late.
Don't wait for us." The radio started to die.

724
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,760
"Harry, can you hear me?" Paul said.

725
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,840
"Can you hear me?" He looked at the others.

726
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,920
"The radio's dead," he said.

727
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:19,840
Rachel and Ruth threw things in some bags.

728
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,680
Ruth wanted to take everything.

729
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,920
"This is my home," she said.

730
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,120
"All my things are here."

731
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:33,880
Rachel wanted to cry: "Let's go! Leave all that! Let's go!"

732
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:41,160
Up on the mountain above Ruth's house a river of red lava
began to flow down the mountain.

733
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,680
Fire suddenly caught on the trees.

734
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,600
The river of lava left everything dead behind it.

735
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,920
The lava came to Ruth's house.

736
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,960
It flowed round to the left and to the right.

737
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,560
It flowed round to the front of the house.

738
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,600
The cars stood there.

739
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,560
Fire started to climb up the outside of the house.

740
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:08,200
Harry looked out of the back window of the house and saw the
lava.

741
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,160
Then the lava broke the window and flowed into the house.

742
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,080
Fire ate chairs, tables, everything.

743
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,960
Harry and Rachel pushed the children to the front door.

744
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,400
Ruth followed with her bags.

745
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,760
Rachel screamed: "Look! The cars!"

746
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,920
Red hot lava flowed under the cars.

747
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,280
Lava flowed from the left and right into the lake.

748
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,880
"There's only the lake," Harry said.

749
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,080
"Let's go!"

750
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:44,000
They ran down to the lake and jumped into Ruth's small boat.

751
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:48,360
"Now we'll be OK," Graham said to Lauren.

752
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,240
Then they saw the fish.

753
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,000
Hundreds of dead fish on the water.

754
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,520
Harry tried to start the boat's engine.

755
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,360
He couldn't do it.

756
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:09,000
Ruth said, "I know this boat. I'll do it." She started the
boat and they moved out across the water.

757
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,560
They looked back at Ruth's house.

758
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,440
There was fire everywhere.

759
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,040
"That was my home," Ruth said.

760
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,600
"I always lived there."

761
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,440
Everybody was very quiet.

762
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,520
One of the cars exploded.

763
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:34,120
"Where's Roughy?" the children thought.

764
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:40,720
"This boat is slow," Harry said, "but it'll get us there."

765
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,680
Then he heard a different noise.

766
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,640
"Where's that noise coming from?" he thought.

767
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:55,520
"Ah, yes, under the boat..." He looked down.

768
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,880
"Don't put your hands in the water," he said.

769
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,840
"Why?" Rachel asked.

770
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,160
"The water's acid."

771
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:11,480
Graham said, "The acid is eating into the boat. Will it get
us there?"

772
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,720
Harry didn't answer.

773
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:22,200
CHAPTER TWELVE

774
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,000
Soon the acid ate through, into the boat.

775
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,320
Acid water began to flow into the boat.

776
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:35,800
Put your feet up, out of the water," Harry said. "We only
have a hundred metres to go."

777
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,520
Then he heard a different noise, much worse.

778
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,000
"The engine is stopping," he said.

779
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,320
He tried not to be afraid.

780
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:56,480
"The acid ate into the engine. There are only thirty or
forty metres to go. Perhaps we'll get there."

781
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,720
The boat moved slowly on.

782
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,000
Thirty metres, twenty, ten...

783
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,280
"Graham, give me your coat," Harry said.

784
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:14,840
He put the coat round his hand and used his hand to move the
boat in the water.

785
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,040
But the acid quickly ate through the coat, and then the boat
stopped.

786
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:23,040
"Only five metres to go," Harry said.

787
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:31,520
"That tree is near - perhaps I can get to it and pull us
in." He tried, but he couldn't.

788
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,160
He tried again.

789
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,120
"Forget it, Harry," Ruth said.

790
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:42,040
"You can't do it." She looked down at the water.

791
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,160
"I can stand here," she said.

792
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,720
Harry turned round.

793
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,480
"Ruth, no!" he said.

794
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,000
But Ruth started to get out of the boat.

795
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,560
Harry moved to stop her but she pulled away.

796
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:01,280
She stood in the water and pushed the boat.

797
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,480
The acid ate at her legs.

798
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:11,320
Rachel, Harry and the children jumped out of the boat, on to
the ground.

799
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,160
Then Ruth screamed.

800
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:19,800
She tried to walk to them, but she fell on the ground.

801
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:24,000
"Don't come near," she said.

802
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,800
"The acid..."

803
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:31,560
They sat and watched her die.

804
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:36,600
"Oh, Ruth," Rachel cried.

805
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:43,280
"I love you." Ruth smiled up at her.

806
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:50,120
"My son didn't know you, Rachel," she said.

807
01:02:50,120 --> 01:03:04,360
"You're good. I want you to be happy." She looked at Harry
and closed her eyes.

808
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,760
She never spoke again.

809
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,840
Rachel and the children cried.

810
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:18,480
The sky was thick with ash and gases.

811
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,400
Harry, Rachel and the children walked down the mountain.

812
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,200
They were tired, and wet with dirty, black rain.

813
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:32,800
Now they could see the town: Suddenly they heard a big noise
to their right.

814
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,360
"What's that?" asked Rachel.

815
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:42,040
"Water, trees, rocks, buildings - all coming fast down the
mountain," Harry said.

816
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,760
"They're going to hit the river - the river through Dante's
Peak."

817
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:52,160
In Dante's Peak Paul Dreyfus and the other scientists were
at the radio.

818
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,000
"Harry, can you hear me?" said Paul.

819
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:03,160
"Harry, we must leave now. It's too dangerous for us to
stay. Sorry."

820
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:08,120
They put their equipment in their cars.

821
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:13,720
Dreyfus drove the car with all the equipment, and the others
all went in the first car.

822
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,840
The first car got across the river.

823
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:20,680
Dreyfus, in the second car, looked up.

824
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:24,200
The river was now much bigger than usual.

825
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:28,120
It was flowing fast, and there were rocks and trees in it.

826
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:32,280
It flowed on to the road and carried his car away.

827
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:37,400
He only had time for one scream before he died.

828
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:43,520
Harry found an old car.

829
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,240
Luckily, the engine started.

830
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,280
They got into it and began to drive.

831
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:55,120
Small rocks hit the car; large rocks hit the ground near
them.

832
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:58,040
Harry thought of Marianne.

833
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:03,360
"Not again, please," he thought.

834
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:08,520
Round the corner they came to a river of lava.

835
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,920
"Can we drive across that?" Rachel asked.

836
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,160
"I don't know," Harry said.

837
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:21,080
"But we must try." He drove as fast as he could at the lava.

838
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,680
A line of fire followed them across the lava.

839
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:30,400
Suddenly Lauren cried, "Look! There's Roughy!"

840
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,880
Roughy waited for them across the lava.

841
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,400
"How did she get here?" Harry said.

842
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,240
"Look!" Graham said.

843
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,080
"More lava is coming up behind Roughy."

844
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:46,080
"We can't stop," Harry said.

845
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,480
"Roughy will have one try only."

846
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,000
They drove along slowly.

847
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,400
Roughy ran up to the car.

848
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,400
Rachel opened her door.

849
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,600
"Come on, Roughy!" she called.

850
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,560
"Jump!"

851
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:04,040
The children screamed, "You can do it, Roughy!"

852
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,360
Roughy jumped.

853
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:10,040
Rachel caught her and pulled her into the car.

854
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,400
The children threw their arms round the dog.

855
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,400
They laughed.

856
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,480
Harry and Rachel laughed too.

857
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:23,400
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

858
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:28,800
They drove into Dante's Peak, but it was not the same town.

859
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:35,120
"Fire and earthquakes did their worst here," Rachel said
sadly.

860
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:40,840
"It was a beautiful town. I was happy to be the mayor."

861
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,720
They came to the river.

862
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:50,120
"We can't get across that," Harry said, "and there's more
lava coming."

863
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,800
"What can we do?" Rachel asked.

864
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,840
"We must get under the ground," Harry said.

865
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,720
"But how?"

866
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,520
Graham looked at him.

867
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,040
"I know," he said.

868
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,240
"The mine."

869
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:15,720
Nancy, Terry, Stan and Greg climbed out of the car and
turned to look back at the mountain.

870
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,680
A big earthquake hit, and the peak of the volcano exploded.

871
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:25,320
New, red-hot lava flowed down the mountain."

872
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:33,360
Goodbye, Harry," said Terry angrily. Nancy started to cry.

873
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:50,640
In the car Harry, Rachel and the children heard the sounds of the explosion. They were near the mine. They looked up at
the mountain. Something dark moved down the mountain very, very fast.

874
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:56,520
"Hot ash and rocks," Harry said. "When it hits us, we're
dead.

875
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,560
No mistakes, now!

876
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,560
I have only one try."

877
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,320
The car engine screamed.

878
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:07,000
Harry drove fast into the mouth of the mine.

879
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,680
Behind them, rocks fell thick and fast.

880
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:15,520
The lava Couldn't get in... but they couldn't get out.

881
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:21,800
"Is everybody OK?" asked Harry, when the car stopped.

882
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:26,320
He kicked out the front window of the car and helped the
others out.

883
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:32,680
"Graham," Harry said, "can we get out of the mine?"

884
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:36,240
"No we can't," Graham said.

885
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:46,400
"I know these mines. We must wait. But it's OK. My friends
and I left some food and drink here. Come with me."

886
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,240
They followed Graham down into the mine.

887
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:53,320
He showed them the food and drink.

888
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,280
There were lights there too.

889
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,480
They sat and ate some food.

890
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,960
Earthquakes moved the ground.

891
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,280
Rocks fell in the mine.

892
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:09,200
"We're going to die here," Lauren cried.

893
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:13,760
"The radio!" Harry suddenly remembered.

894
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:17,720
"I left the radio in the car. I must go back and get it."

895
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:20,920
"No, I'll go," Graham said.

896
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,560
"No, you stay," Harry said.

897
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,440
"We're going to die," cried Lauren.

898
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,360
"No, we're not," Harry said.

899
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,640
Hey, I know.

900
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,560
When we get out, we'll all go to the sea and catch fish.

901
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:41,640
I don't usually take holidays, but with you it will be good.

902
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,920
OK?

903
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,080
We'll do that?"

904
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,320
Rachel looked at Harry and smiled.

905
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,960
"Yeah," she said.

906
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,840
"We'll do that together. We'll be a family."

907
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,280
"OK," said Harry.

908
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,600
"But now I must go."

909
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,400
He walked back through the mine.

910
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,920
Suddenly he heard a sound above him.

911
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,920
He ran for the car.

912
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:12,200
Behind him, rocks fell.

913
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,800
He couldn't go back.

914
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,240
More and more rocks fell.

915
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:21,880
He was near the car when a rock hit his left arm and broke
it.

916
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,000
Other rocks hit his head and his legs.

917
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,960
He climbed inside the car, found the radio and turned it on.

918
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,640
"Help," he said.

919
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,000
"Please send help."

920
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,840
Two days later, the earthquakes stopped.

921
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,640
The volcano went quiet.

922
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:48,280
A big helicopter came down outside the mine.

923
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:58,000
Inside, when they pulled away hundreds of rocks, they found
Harry first, with the radio in his hands.

924
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,640
He stood by the helicopter, and a doctor looked at his arm.

925
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:07,920
Then the men brought Rachel and the children out of the
mine.

926
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,200
Harry walked over to them.

927
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,200
"Wait!" the doctor said.

928
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,000
"Your arm..."

929
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,120
But Harry had his arms round Rachel.

930
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:24,120
The children ran up and he took them in his arms too.

931
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:43,040
Nobody said a word - they were too happy.
