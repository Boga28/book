00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,120
CHAPTER ONE
The Champion of the World

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,090
All day, when not selling petrol, we had been
leaning over the table in the office of my

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,770
petrol station, preparing the raisins.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:18,390
We had a hundred and ninety-six of them to
do altogether, and it was nearly evening before

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,880
we had finished.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,169
'Don't they look wonderful!'

7
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:26,009
Claud cried, rubbing his hands together hard.

8
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:28,539
'What time is it, Gordon?'

9
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,060
'Just after five.'

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,530
Through the window we could see a car arriving
at the petrol pumps, with a woman at the wheel

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,210
and about eight children in the back, eating
ice creams.

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,100
'We ought to be going soon,' Claud said.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,590
'The plan won't work if we don't arrive before
sunset.'

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,500
He was getting nervous now.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,410
We both went outside, and Claud gave the woman
her petrol.

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,180
When she had gone, he remained standing in
the middle of the yard, looking anxiously

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,350
up at the sun.

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,590
'All right,' I said.

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,210
'Lock up.'

20
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,240
He went quickly from pump to pump, locking
each one.

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,670
'You'd better take off that yellow sweater,'
he said.

22
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,430
'You'll be shining like a light out there
in the moonlight.'

23
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,570
'I'll be all right.'

24
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,549
'You will not,' he said.

25
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,110
'Take it off, Gordon, please.

26
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,580
I'll see you in three minutes.'

27
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,490
He disappeared into his hut behind the petrol
station, and I went and changed my yellow

28
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,570
sweater for a blue one.

29
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,840
When we met again outside, Claud was dressed
in a pair of black trousers and a dark-green

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,030
sweater.

31
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,729
On his head he wore a brown cloth cap pulled
down low over his eyes.

32
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:50,909
'What's under there?'

33
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,880
I asked, staring at his unusually thick waist.

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,869
He pulled up his sweater and showed me two
very thin but very large white cotton bags

35
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:04,670
tied neatly and tightly around his waist.

36
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,840
'To carry the stuff,' he said.

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,459
'I see.'

38
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:12,000
'Let's go,' he said.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,750
'I still think we ought to take the car.'

40
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,730
'It's too risky.

41
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,760
They'll see it parked.'

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,730
'But it's over five kilometers up to that
wood.'

43
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,110
'Yes,' he said.

44
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,100
'And I suppose you realize we can get six
months in prison if they catch us.'

45
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,319
'You never told me that.'

46
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,340
'Didn't I?'

47
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,730
'I'm not coming,' I said.

48
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,730
'It's not worth it.'

49
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,570
'The walk will be good for you, Gordon.

50
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,280
Come on.'

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,570
It was a calm, sunny evening, with little
clouds hanging motionless in the sky, and

52
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,739
the valley was cool and very quiet as the
two of us began walking along the grass on

53
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:56,290
the side of the road that ran between the
hills towards Oxford.

54
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,420
'Have you got the raisins?'

55
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,420
Claud asked.

56
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,390
'They're in my pocket.'

57
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,290
'Good,' he said.

58
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,269
'Wonderful.'

59
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:11,720
Ten minutes later, we turned left off the
main road into a narrow side road with high

60
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,709
bushes on either side, and then it was all
uphill.

61
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,530
'How many keepers are there?'

62
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,319
I asked.

63
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,319
'Three.'

64
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,590
Claud threw away a half-finished cigarette
and lit another.

65
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,130
'Don't tell anyone how we've done it, do you
understand?

66
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,880
Because if anyone heard, every fool in the
district would do the same thing, and there

67
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,610
wouldn't be a pheasant left.'

68
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,570
'I won't say a word.'

69
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,530
'You ought to be very proud of yourself,'
he went on.

70
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,670
'There have been clever men studying this
problem for hundreds of years, and not one

71
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,460
of them's ever found anything even a quarter
as clever as you have.

72
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,550
Why didn't you tell me about it before?'

73
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,870
'You never asked for my opinion,' I said.

74
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,860
And that was the truth.

75
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,190
In fact, until the day before, Claud had never
even offered to discuss with me the subject

76
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,590
of poaching.

77
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:13,030
Often, on a summer's evening when work was
finished, I had seen him disappearing up the

78
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,160
road towards the woods; and sometimes as I
watched him through the window of the petrol

79
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,630
station, I would wonder exactly what he was
going to do, what tricks he was going to practice

80
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,700
ah alone up there under the trees at night.

81
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:35,120
He seldom came back until very late and he
never, absolutely never, brought anything

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,500
with him on his return.

83
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,440
But the following afternoon - I couldn't imagine
how he did it - there would always be a pheasant

84
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,390
or a rabbit hanging up in the hut behind the
petrol station.

85
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:53,760
This summer he had been particularly active,
and during the past couple of months he had

86
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,980
been going out four and sometimes five nights
a week.

87
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,170
But that was not all.

88
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,170
It seemed to me that recently his whole attitude
to poaching had changed.

89
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:11,480
He was more purposeful about it now, and I
suspected that it had become a kind of private

90
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,740
war against the famous Mr Victor Hazel himself.

91
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,490
Mr Hazel was extremely rich and his property
stretched a long way down each side of the

92
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,830
valley.

93
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,710
He was a brewer, with no charm at all and
few good points.

94
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:35,300
He hated all poor people because he himself
had once been poor, and he tried to mix with

95
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,770
what he believed were the right kind of people.

96
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:45,590
He hunted and gave shooting-parties and every
day he drove a big, black Rolls-Royce past

97
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,300
the petrol station on his way to and from
his factory.

98
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,060
As he drove by, we would sometimes see his
great, shining face above the wheel.

99
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,060
Anyway, the day before, which was Wednesday,
Claud had suddenly said to me, 'I'll be going

100
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,060
up to Hazel's woods again tonight.

101
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,060
Why don't you come along?'

102
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,060
'Who, me?'

103
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,060
'It's about the last chance this year for
pheasants,' he had said.

104
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,060
'The shooting season begins on Saturday, and
the birds will be scattered all over the place

105
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,060
after that - if there are any left.'

106
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,060
'Why the sudden invitation?'

107
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,060
I had asked.

108
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,060
'No special reason, Gordon.

109
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,090
No reason at all.'

110
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,800
'I suppose you keep a gun hidden away up there?'

111
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,180
'A gun!' he cried, disgusted.

112
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,560
'Nobody ever shoots pheasants, didn't you
know that?

113
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,801
If you shoot a gun in Hazel's woods, the keepers
will hear you.'

114
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:22,660
'Then how do you do it?'

115
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,330
'Ah,' he said.

116
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,100
There was a long pause.

117
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,760
Then he said, 'Do you think you could keep
your mouth closed if I told you?'

118
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,190
'Certainly.'

119
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,150
'I've never told this to anyone else in my
whole life, Gordon.'

120
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,180
'I am greatly honoured,' I said.

121
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,090
'You can trust me completely.'

122
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,180
He turned his head, looking at me with pale
eyes.

123
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:54,020
'I am now going to tell you the three best
ways in the world of poaching a pheasant,'

124
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,200
he said.

125
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,750
'And, as you're the guest on this little trip,
I am going to give you the choice of which

126
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,630
one you'd like to use tonight.

127
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,160
Now, here's the first big secret.'

128
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,010
He paused.

129
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:16,560
'Pheasants,' he whispered softly, 'are mad
about raisins.'

130
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,930
'Raisins?'

131
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,630
'Just ordinary raisins.

132
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,840
My father discovered that more than forty
years ago.

133
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,460
He was a great poacher, Gordon.

134
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,030
Possibly the best there's ever been in the
history of England.

135
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,270
My father studied poaching like a scientist.

136
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,960
He really did.'

137
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,930
'I believe you.'

138
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,410
Claud paused and glanced over his shoulder,
as if he wanted to make sure there was no

139
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,860
one listening.

140
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,590
'Here's how it's done,' he said.

141
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:55,690
'First, you take a few raisins and you put
them in water overnight to make them nice

142
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,340
and big and juicy.

143
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:05,270
Then you get a bit of good stiff horsehair
and you cut it into small lengths.

144
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,860
Then you push one of these lengths through
the middle of each raisin, so that there's

145
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,470
a small piece sticking out on either side.

146
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,830
Do you understand?'

147
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,930
'Yes.'

148
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:22,070
'So, the pheasant comes along and eats one
of these raisins.

149
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,070
Right?

150
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,970
And you're watching him from behind a tree.

151
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,270
So what then?'

152
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,700
'I imagine it sticks in its throat.'

153
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,890
'That's obvious, Gordon.

154
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,300
But here's the strange thing.

155
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,760
Here's what my father discovered.

156
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,650
The moment that happens, the bird never moves
his feet again!

157
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:49,860
He becomes absolutely rooted to the spot and
you can walk calmly out from the place where

158
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,550
you're hiding and pick him up in your hands.'

159
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,440
'I don't believe it.'

160
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,890
'I swear it,' he said.

161
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,210
'You can fire a gun in his ear and he won't
even jump.

162
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:09,560
It's just one of those unexplainable little
things, but you have to be very clever to

163
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,670
discover it.'

164
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,470
He paused and there was a look of pride in
his eyes as he thought for a moment of his

165
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,760
father, the great inventor.

166
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,860
'So that's method number one,' he said.

167
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,010
'Method number two is even more simple.

168
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,250
You take a fishing line.

169
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,581
Then you put the raisin on the hook, and you
fish for pheasants just as you fish for a

170
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:36,020
fish.

171
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:42,170
You let out the line by about fifty meters,
and you lie there on your stomach in the bushes,

172
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,950
waiting until a pheasant starts eating.

173
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,110
Then you pull him in.'

174
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,370
'What is method number three?'

175
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,710
I asked.

176
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,620
'Ah,' he said.

177
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,840
'Number three is the best one.

178
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,910
It was the last one my father ever invented
before he died.

179
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:04,070
First of all, you dig a little hole in the
ground.

180
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:10,510
Then you twist a piece of paper into the shape
of a hat and you fit this into the hole, with

181
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,340
the hollow end upwards, like a cup.

182
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,590
Then you put some glue around the edge.

183
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:25,340
After that, you lay some raisins on the ground
leading up to it and drop a few raisins into

184
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,280
the paper cup.

185
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,640
The old pheasant comes along, and when he
gets to the hole he puts his head inside to

186
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,700
eat the raisins, and the next thing he knows
is that he's got a paper hat stuck over his

187
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,400
eyes and he can't see anything.

188
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,040
Isn't it wonderful what some people think
of, Gordon?

189
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,050
Don't you agree?

190
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,730
No bird in the world will move if you cover
its eyes.'

191
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,940
'Your father was very clever,' I said.

192
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:01,320
'Then choose which of the three methods you
like best, and we'll use it tonight.'

193
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,680
'Yes, but let me ask you something first.

194
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,400
I've just had an idea.'

195
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,370
'Keep it,' he said.

196
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,480
'You are talking about a subject you know
nothing about.'

197
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,191
'Do you remember that bottle of sleeping pills
the doctor gave me last month when I had a

198
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:19,590
bad back?'

199
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,440
'What about them?'

200
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,480
'Is there any reason why they wouldn't work
on a pheasant?'

201
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,160
Claud closed his eyes and shook his head.

202
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,740
'Wait,' I said.

203
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,280
'It's not worth discussing,' he said.

204
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,010
'No pheasant in the world is going to swallow
those red pills.'

205
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,550
'You're forgetting the raisins,' I said.

206
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,540
'Now listen to this.

207
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,460
We take a raisin.

208
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,720
Then we put it in water.

209
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,860
Then we make a small cut in one side of it.

210
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,270
Then we hollow it out a little.

211
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,780
Then we open up one of my red pills and pour
all the powder into the raisin.

212
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,360
Then we get a needle and thread and very carefully
we sew up the cut.

213
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,720
Now out of the corner of my eye, I saw Claud's
mouth beginning to open.

214
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,610
'Now,' I said, 'we have a nice, clean-looking
raisin with sleeping powder inside it, and

215
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,860
that's enough to make the average man unconscious;
it will easily work on birds!

216
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,440
I paused for ten seconds to allow him time
to understand.

217
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,710
'And with this method we could really work
with huge numbers.

218
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,440
We could prepare twenty raisins if we wanted
to, and all we'd have to do is throw them

219
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,660
on the ground where the birds feed at sunset
and then walk away.

220
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:44,830
Half an hour later, we'd come back and the
pills would be beginning to work and the pheasants

221
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,570
would be up in the branches by then.

222
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:53,250
They'd feel sleepy and soon every pheasant
that had eaten one single raisin would fall

223
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,779
over unconscious and fall to the ground.

224
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:01,720
They'd be dropping out of the trees like apples,
and we could just walk around picking them

225
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,600
up!'

226
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,540
Claud was staring at me.

227
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,600
'And they'd never catch us either.

228
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,560
We'd simply walk through the woods, dropping
a few raisins here and there as we went, and

229
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,380
even if the keepers were watching us, they
wouldn't notice anything.'

230
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:29,990
'Gordon,' he said, 'if this thing works, it
will revolutionize poaching.'

231
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,570
'I'm glad to hear it.'

232
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,570
'How many pills have you got left?' he asked.

233
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,570
'Forty-nine.

234
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,570
There were fifty in the bottle, and I've only
used one.'

235
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,650
'Forty-nine's not enough.

236
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,360
We want at least two hundred.'

237
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,110
'Are you mad?'

238
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,370
I cried.

239
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:53,210
He walked slowly away and stood by the door
with his back to me, looking at the sky.

240
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:57,550
'Two hundred at least,' he said quietly.

241
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,940
'It's not worth doing it unless we have two
hundred.'

242
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,820
What is it now, I wondered.

243
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,350
What's he trying to do?

244
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:13,110
'This is almost the last chance we have before
the season starts,' he said.

245
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,790
'I couldn't possibly get any more.'

246
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,160
'You wouldn't want us to come back empty-handed,
would you?'

247
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,960
'But why so many?'

248
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,060
Claud looked at me.

249
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,450
'Why not?' he said gently.

250
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,850
'Do you have any objections?'

251
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,550
My God, I thought suddenly.

252
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:38,990
He wants to wreck Mr Victor Hazel's opening-day
shooting-party.

253
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:44,440
Mr Hazel's party took place on the first of
October every year and it was a very famous

254
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,670
event.

255
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:52,330
Gentlemen, some with noble titles and some
who were just very rich, came long distances,

256
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:57,260
with their dogs and their wives, and all day
long the noise of the shooting rolled across

257
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,050
the valley.

258
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,020
There were always enough pheasants for everyone;
each summer the woods were filled with dozens

259
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:10,200
and dozens of young birds at great expense,
but to Mr Victor Hazel it was worth every

260
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,870
penny of it.

261
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:18,460
He became, if only for a few hours, a big
man in a little world.

262
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,610
'You get us two hundred of those pills,' Claud
said, 'and then it'll be worth doing.'

263
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,150
'I can't,' I said.

264
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,170
'Why couldn't we divide one pill among four
raisins?'

265
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,310
'But would a quarter of a pill be strong enough
for each bird?'

266
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,410
'Work it out for yourself.

267
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,550
It's all done by body weight.

268
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,420
You'd be giving it about twenty times more
than is necessary.'

269
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,600
'Then we'll quarter the amount,' he said,
rubbing his hands together.

270
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,120
He paused and then thought for a moment.

271
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,520
'We'll have one hundred and ninety-six raisins!'

272
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,670
'Do you realize what that means?'

273
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,670
I said.

274
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,029
'They'll take hours to prepare.'

275
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:00,960
'It doesn't matter!' he cried.

276
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,220
'We'll go tomorrow instead.

277
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:08,770
We'll put the raisins in water overnight and
then we'll have all morning and afternoon

278
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,750
to get them ready.'

279
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,710
And that was exactly what we did.

280
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:19,770
Now, twenty-four hours later, we were on our
way.

281
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,220
We had been walking steadily for about forty
minutes, and we were nearing the point where

282
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,480
the path curved round to the right and ran
along the top of the hill towards the big

283
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,060
woods where the pheasants lived.

284
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,290
We were about two kilometers away.

285
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,540
'I don't suppose these keepers might be carrying
guns?'

286
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,140
I asked.

287
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,010
'All keepers carry guns,' Claud said.

288
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,950
I had been afraid of that.

289
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,149
'It's mostly for the foxes,' he added.

290
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:48,149
'Ah.'

291
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:51,220
'Of course, they sometimes shoot at a poacher.'

292
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,940
'You're joking.'

293
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,250
'They only do it from behind - when you're
running away.

294
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,480
They like to shoot you in the legs at about
fifty meters.'

295
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,370
'They can't do that!'

296
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,370
I cried.

297
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,900
'It's a criminal offence!'

298
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,790
'So is poaching,' Claud said.

299
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,170
We walked on for a while in silence.

300
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,720
The sun was low on our right now, and the
road was in shadow.

301
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,339
We had reached the top of the hill and now
we could see the woods ahead of us, large

302
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,829
and dark, with the sun going down behind the
trees.

303
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,090
'You'd better let me have those raisins,'
Claud said.

304
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,160
I gave him the bag, and he put it gently into
his trouser pocket.

305
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,280
'No talking when we're inside,' he said.

306
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,070
'Just follow me and try not to break any branches.'

307
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,400
Five minutes later we were there.

308
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,460
The path ran right up to the wood itself and
then went round the edge of it for about three

309
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,179
hundred meters, with only a few bushes in
between.

310
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:59,420
Claud slipped through the bushes on his hands
and knees and I followed.

311
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,390
It was cool and dark inside the wood.

312
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,720
No sunlight came in at all.

313
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,450
'This is frightening,' I said.

314
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,450
'Sh-h-h!'

315
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,040
Claud was very nervous.

316
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,280
He was walking just ahead of me.

317
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,670
He kept his head moving all the time and his
eyes were looking from side to side, searching

318
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,000
for danger.

319
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,260
I tried doing the same, but I soon began to
imagine a keeper behind every tree, so I gave

320
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,520
it up.

321
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,920
Then a patch of sky appeared ahead of us in
the roof of the forest, and I knew this must

322
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,710
be the feeding grounds.

323
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,710
We were now advancing quickly, running from
tree to tree and stopping and waiting and

324
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:48,991
listening and running on again, and then at
last we knelt safely behind a big tree, right

325
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:54,220
on the edge of the feeding grounds, and Claud
smiled and pointed through the branches at

326
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,450
the pheasants.

327
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,770
The place was absolutely full of birds.

328
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,230
There must have been two hundred of them at
least.

329
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,170
'Do you see what I mean?'

330
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,580
Claud whispered.

331
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,610
It was an amazing sight - a poacher's dream.

332
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,860
And how close they were!

333
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,670
Some of them were not more than ten steps
from where we were kneeling.

334
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:24,750
They were brown and so fat that their feathers
almost brushed the ground as they walked.

335
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,730
I glanced at Claud.

336
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,190
His big cow-like face showed his pleasure.

337
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,559
The mouth was slightly open, and there was
a kind of dream-like look in his eyes as he

338
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,150
stared at the pheasants.

339
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,520
There was a long pause.

340
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,330
The birds made a strange noise as they moved
about among the dead leaves.

341
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,470
'Ah-ha,' Claud said softly a minute later.

342
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,370
'Do you see the keeper?'

343
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,700
'Where?'

344
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,240
'Over on the other side, standing by that
big tree.

345
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,880
Look carefully.'

346
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,520
'Good heavens!'

347
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,850
'It's all right.

348
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,309
He can't see us.'

349
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:06,780
We knelt close to the ground, watching the
keeper.

350
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,490
He was a small man with a cap on his head
and a gun under his arm.

351
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,630
He never moved.

352
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,299
He was like a little post standing there.

353
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,990
'Let's go,' I whispered.

354
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,980
The keeper's face was shadowed by his cap,
but it seemed to me that he was looking directly

355
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,650
at us.

356
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,710
'I'm not staying here,' I said.

357
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,860
'Sh-h-h!'

358
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,450
Claud said.

359
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:37,280
Slowly, never taking his eyes off the keeper,
he reached into his pocket and brought out

360
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,410
a single raisin.

361
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,930
He placed it in his right hand and then quickly
threw it high into the air.

362
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:49,590
I watched it as it went over the bushes, and
I saw it land within a meter of two birds

363
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,970
standing together beside an old tree.

364
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,160
Both birds turned their heads at the drop
of the raisin.

365
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,660
Then one of them jumped over and ate it quickly.

366
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,450
I glanced up at the keeper.

367
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,679
He hadn't moved.

368
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,640
Claud threw a second raisin; then a third,
and a fourth and a fifth.

369
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,440
At this point I saw the keeper turn his head
away to look at the woods behind him.

370
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,850
Quickly, Claud pulled the paper bag out of
his pocket.

371
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:23,480
With a great movement of the arm he threw
the whole handful high over the bushes.

372
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,370
They fell softly like raindrops on dry leaves.

373
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,330
Every pheasant in the place must have heard
them fall.

374
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,870
There was a noise of wings and a rush to find
the raisins.

375
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,030
The birds were eating all of them madly.

376
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,710
'Follow me,' Claud whispered.

377
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,650
'And keep down.'

378
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,900
He started moving away quickly on his hands
and knees, under cover of the bushes.

379
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,400
I went after him, and we went along like this
for about a hundred meters.

380
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,559
'Now run!'

381
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,170
Claud said.

382
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:59,840
We got to our feet and ran, and a few minutes
later we came out through the bushes into

383
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,540
the open safety of the path.

384
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:07,450
'It went wonderfully,' Claud said, breathing
heavily.

385
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,890
'Didn't it go absolutely wonderfully?'

386
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,700
His big face was red.

387
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,830
'In another five minutes, it'll be completely
dark inside the woods, and that keeper will

388
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,470
be going off home to his supper.'

389
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,880
'I think I'll go, too,' I said.

390
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,180
'You're a great poacher,' Claud said.

391
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,850
He sat down on the grass bank and lit a cigarette.

392
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:37,250
The sun had set now and the sky was a pale
blue, faintly coloured with yellow.

393
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,820
In the wood behind us, the shadows and the
spaces between the trees were turning from

394
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,620
grey to black.

395
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,610
'How long does a sleeping pill take to work?'

396
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,610
Claud asked.

397
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,610
'Look out!'

398
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,610
I said.

399
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,230
'There's someone coming.'

400
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,670
The man had appeared silently and suddenly
out of the half-darkness, and he was only

401
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,030
thirty meters away when I saw him.

402
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,160
'Another keeper,' Claud said.

403
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,910
We both looked at the keeper as he came down
the road towards us.

404
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:10,700
He had a gun under his arm, and there was
a black dog walking at his feet.

405
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,000
He stopped when he was a few steps away, and
the dog stopped with him and stayed behind

406
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,910
him, watching us through the keeper's legs.

407
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,780
'Good evening,' Claud said in a nice friendly
way.

408
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:28,910
This one was a tall man of about forty with
quick eyes and hard, dangerous hands.

409
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:33,610
'I know you,' he said softly, coming closer.

410
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,140
'I know both of you.'

411
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,780
Claud did not answer this.

412
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,790
'You're from the petrol station, right?'

413
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,520
His lips were thin and dry.

414
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,060
'You're Cubbage and Hawes and you're from
the petrol station on the main road.

415
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,330
Right?

416
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,330
Get out.'

417
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,230
Claud sat on the bank, smoking his cigarette
and looking at the keeper's feet.

418
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,970
'Go on,' the man said.

419
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,460
'Get out.'

420
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,260
'This is a public road,' Claud said.

421
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,250
'Please go away.'

422
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,360
The keeper moved the gun from his left arm
to his right.

423
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,030
'You're waiting,' he said, 'to commit a criminal
act.

424
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,460
I could have you arrested for that.'

425
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,890
'No, you couldn't,' Claud said.

426
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,450
All this made me rather nervous.

427
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:27,710
'I've been watching you for some time,' the
keeper said, looking at Claud.

428
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,130
'It's getting late,' I said.

429
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,190
'Shall we go on?'

430
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,030
Claud threw away his cigarette and got slowly
to his feet.

431
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,690
'All right,' he said.

432
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,720
'Let's go.'

433
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,100
We wandered off down the road, the way we
had come, leaving him standing there, and

434
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,630
soon the man was out of sight in the half-darkness
behind us.

435
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,760
'That's the head keeper,' said Claud.

436
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,660
'His name is Rabbetts.'

437
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,790
'Let's get out of here,' I said.

438
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,530
'Come in here,' Claud said.

439
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:03,220
There was a gate on our left leading into
a field, and we climbed over it and sat down

440
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,799
behind the bushes.

441
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,190
'Mr Rabbetts is also due for his supper,'
Claud said.

442
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,970
'You mustn't worry about him.'

443
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,290
We sat quietly behind the bushes, waiting
for the keeper to walk past us on his way

444
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,290
home.

445
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,250
'Here he is,' Claud whispered.

446
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,640
'Don't move.'

447
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,330
The keeper came softly along the road with
the dog walking beside him, and we watched

448
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,470
them through the bushes as they went by.

449
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,910
'He won't be coming back tonight,' Claud said.

450
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,510
'How do you know that?'

451
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:41,850
'A keeper never waits for you in a wood if
he knows where you live.

452
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,390
He goes to your house, hides and watches for
you to come back.'

453
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,480
'That's worse.'

454
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,120
'No, it isn't.

455
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,450
Not if you put what you've poached somewhere
else before you go home.

456
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,600
He can't do anything then.'

457
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,160
'What about the other one - the one in the
feeding grounds?'

458
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,860
'He's gone, too.'

459
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,940
'You can't be sure of that.'

460
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,360
'I've been watching these men for months,
Gordon.

461
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,440
Honestly, I know all their habits.

462
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,190
There's no danger.'

463
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,350
A few minutes later, I followed Claud back
into the wood.

464
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:24,080
It was dark in there now, and very silent,
and we moved cautiously forward.

465
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,370
'Here's where we threw the raisins,' Claud
said.

466
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,150
I looked through the bushes.

467
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,860
The area was illuminated by the moonlight.

468
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,490
'You're quite sure the keeper's gone?'

469
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,490
'I know he's gone.'

470
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:44,010
I could just see Claud's face under his cap,
the pale lips, and the large eyes with excitement

471
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,770
dancing in each of them.

472
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,900
'Are they asleep?'

473
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,320
I asked.

474
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
'Yes.

475
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,580
In the branches.'

476
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,580
'Where?'

477
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,990
'All around.

478
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,140
They don't go far.'

479
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,309
'What do we do next?'

480
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:00,860
'We stay here and wait.

481
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:06,400
I brought you a light,' he added, and he handed
me one of those small pocket torches shaped

482
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,910
like a pen.

483
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,440
'You may need it.'

484
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,300
We stood there for a long time, waiting for
something to happen.

485
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,360
'I've just had a thought,' I said.

486
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,050
'If a bird can keep its balance on a branch
when it's asleep, then surely there's no reason

487
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,870
why the pills should make it fall down.'

488
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,280
Claud looked at me quickly.

489
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,530
'It's not dead,' I said.

490
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,190
'It's still only sleeping.'

491
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,760
'It's drugged,' Claud said.

492
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,000
'But that's just a deeper sort of sleep.'

493
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,740
There was a silence.

494
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,710
'We should have tried it first with chickens,'
Claud said.

495
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,559
'My father would have done that.'

496
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:51,910
'Your father was clever,' I said.

497
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:56,020
At that moment there came a soft thump from
the woods.

498
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,020
'Hey!'

499
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,850
I said.

500
00:27:58,850 --> 00:27:59,850
'Sh-h-h!'

501
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,289
We stood listening.

502
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:02,289
Thump!

503
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,299
'There's another!'

504
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:09,300
It was a heavy sound, as if a small bag of
sand had been dropped from about shoulder

505
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,300
height.

506
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Thump!

507
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,789
'They're pheasants!'

508
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:14,539
I cried.

509
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:15,539
'Wait!'

510
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,780
'I'm sure they're pheasants.'

511
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,780
Thump!

512
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,780
Thump!

513
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,190
'You're right!'

514
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,820
We ran back into the wood.

515
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,440
'Where were they?'

516
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,510
I asked.

517
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,590
'Over here!

518
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,460
Two of them were over here!'

519
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,419
'I thought they were this way.'

520
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:32,570
'Keep looking!'

521
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,730
Claud shouted.

522
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,059
'They can't be far.'

523
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,270
We searched for about another minute.

524
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,690
'Here's one!' he called out.

525
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,130
When I got to him, he was holding a wonderful
bird in both hands.

526
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,460
We looked at it closely with our torches.

527
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,490
'It's unconscious,' Claud said.

528
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,760
'It's still alive.

529
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,370
I can feel its heart.'

530
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,370
Thump!

531
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,020
'There's another,' he cried.

532
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,020
Thump!

533
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,020
Thump!

534
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,020
'Two more!'

535
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
Thump!

536
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
Thump!

537
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
Thump!

538
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
Thump!

539
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
Thump!

540
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,020
Thump!

541
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,020
Thump!

542
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,020
Thump!

543
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,020
Thump!

544
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
Thump!

545
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,370
All around us, pheasants were starting to
rain down out of the trees.

546
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:17,690
We began to rush around madly in the dark,
sweeping the ground with our lights.

547
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,690
Thump!

548
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,690
Thump!

549
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,690
Thump!

550
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,230
This lot fell almost on top of me.

551
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:27,990
I was right under the tree as they came down,
and I found all three of them immediately.

552
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,980
They were warm, the feathers wonderfully soft
in my hands.

553
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,340
'Where shall I put them?'

554
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,799
I called out.

555
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,620
I was holding them by the legs.

556
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,070
'Lay them here, Gordon!

557
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,830
Just pile them there where it's light.'

558
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:48,669
Claud was standing with the moonlight streaming
down all over him and a great bunch of pheasants

559
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:49,830
in each hand.

560
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:55,980
His face was bright, his eyes big and bright
and wonderful, and he was staring like a child

561
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,870
who has just discovered that the whole world
is made of chocolate.

562
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,870
Thump!

563
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,870
Thump!

564
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,870
Thump!

565
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,929
'I don't like it,' I said.

566
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,380
'It's too many.'

567
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:12,160
'It's beautiful!' he cried, and he threw down
the birds he was carrying and ran off to look

568
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,570
for more.

569
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,570
Thump!

570
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,570
Thump!

571
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,570
Thump!

572
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,570
Thump!

573
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,570
Thump!

574
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,570
It was easy to find them now.

575
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,120
There were one or two lying under every tree.

576
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,290
I quickly collected six more, three in each
hand, and ran back and threw them with the

577
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,490
others.

578
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,510
Then six more.

579
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,520
Then six more after that.

580
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,750
And still they kept falling.

581
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,780
Claud was madly happy.

582
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,169
He was rushing about under the trees.

583
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:44,660
I could see the beam of his light waving around
in the dark, and each time he found a bird,

584
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,840
he gave a little cry of pleasure.

585
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Thump!

586
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Thump!

587
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Thump!

588
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,740
'Mr Victor Hazel ought to hear this!'

589
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,660
'Don't shout,' I said.

590
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,960
'There might be keepers.'

591
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,090
For three or four minutes, the pheasants kept
on falling.

592
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,340
Then suddenly they stopped.

593
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,340
'Keep searching!'

594
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,340
Claud shouted.

595
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,610
'There are a lot more on the ground.'

596
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,350
'Don't you think we ought to stop?'

597
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,990
'No,' he said.

598
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,940
We went on searching.

599
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,410
We looked under every tree within a hundred
meters of the feeding grounds - north, south,

600
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,980
east and west - and I think we found most
of them.

601
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,490
At the collecting point there was a very big
pile of pheasants.

602
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,480
'It's wonderful,' Claud said.

603
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,220
'It's wonderful.'

604
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,530
He was staring at them in a kind of dream.

605
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:42,361
'We'd better just take half a dozen each and
get out quickly,' I said.

606
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:43,780
'I would like to count them, Gordon.'

607
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,800
'There's no time for that.'

608
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,900
'I must count them.'

609
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,169
'No,' I said.

610
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:53,360
'Come on.'

611
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,730
'One, two, three, four...'

612
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:02,659
He began counting them very carefully, picking
up each bird and laying it down gently to

613
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:04,169
one side.

614
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:08,710
The moon was directly above now and everything
was illuminated.

615
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,950
'I'm not standing around here like this,'
I said.

616
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:17,909
I walked back a few steps and hid myself in
the shadows, waiting for him to finish.

617
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:26,210
'A hundred and seventeen, a hundred and eighteen,
a hundred and nineteen, a hundred and twenty!'

618
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,210
he cried.

619
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,230
'One hundred and twenty birds!

620
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,929
It's an all-time record!'

621
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:34,760
I did not doubt it for a moment.

622
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,690
'The most my father ever got in one night
was fifteen.'

623
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:43,059
'You're the champion of the world,' I said.

624
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:44,940
'Are you ready now?'

625
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,090
'One minute,' he answered, and he pulled up
his sweater and began to unwind the two big

626
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,740
white cotton bags from around his waist.

627
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,420
'Here's yours,' he said, handing one of them
to me.

628
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,440
'Fill it up quickly.'

629
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,340
'You don't think that keeper is watching us
right now, do you, from behind a tree?'

630
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,400
'There's no chance of that,' Claud said.

631
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,580
'He's down at the petrol station, as I told
you, waiting for us both to come home.'

632
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,110
We started loading the pheasants into the
bags.

633
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,440
'There'll be a taxi waiting for us in the
road,' Claud said.

634
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
'What?'

635
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,580
'I always go back in a taxi, Gordon.

636
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,100
Didn't you know that?

637
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,730
A taxi is impersonal.

638
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:30,600
No one knows who's inside a taxi except the
taxi driver.

639
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,690
My father taught me that.'

640
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,290
'Which driver?'

641
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,890
'Charlie Kinch.

642
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,100
He's glad to help.'

643
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,600
We finished loading the pheasants, and I tried
to carry my bag on my shoulder.

644
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,980
The bag had about sixty birds in it and it
was heavy.

645
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
Very heavy.

646
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,700
'I can't carry this,' I said.

647
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,890
'We'll have to leave some of them behind.'

648
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,740
'Drag it,' Claud said.

649
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,260
'Just pull it behind you.'

650
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,270
We started off through the black woods, pulling
the pheasants behind us.

651
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:06,669
'We'll never get them all the way back to
the village like this,' I said.

652
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:10,629
'Charlie's never disappointed me yet,' Claud
said.

653
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:14,419
We came to the edge of the woods and looked
through the bushes into the road.

654
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,839
The taxi was there, not five meters away.

655
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:23,479
Claud said, 'Charlie boy,' very softly, and
the old man behind the wheel put his head

656
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:27,019
out into the moonlight and gave us a smile.

657
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:30,569
We slid through the bushes, dragging the bags
after us.

658
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,569
'Hello!'

659
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,710
Charlie said.

660
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,129
'What's this?'

661
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:36,979
'Potatoes,' Claud told him.

662
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:39,319
'Open the door.'

663
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:44,899
Two minutes later we were safely inside the
taxi, driving slowly down the hill towards

664
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:48,139
the village.

665
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,529
It was all over now.

666
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:56,229
Claud was very happy, full of pride and excitement,
and he kept leaning forward and tapping Charlie

667
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:59,300
on the shoulder and saying, 'What do you think,
Charlie?

668
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:05,089
What do you think about this?' and Charlie
kept glancing back at the large full bags

669
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:10,069
lying on the floor between us and saying,
'How did you do it?'

670
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:14,890
'There's a dozen of them for you, Charlie,'
Claud said.

671
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:21,859
Charlie said, 'I think pheasants are going
to be a bit scarce up at Mr Hazel's opening-day

672
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:27,599
shooting-party this year,' and Claud said,
'I imagine they are, Charlie.

673
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,660
I imagine they are.'

674
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,470
'What are you going to do with a hundred and
twenty pheasants?'

675
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,700
I asked.

676
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,420
'Put them in the freezer at the petrol station,'
Claud said.

677
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,839
'Not tonight, I hope.'

678
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,369
'No, Gordon, not tonight.

679
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:47,430
We leave them at Bessie's house tonight.'

680
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,170
'Bessie who?'

681
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,200
'Bessie Organ.'

682
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,229
'Bessie Organ!'

683
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:55,730
I was absolutely amazed.

684
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:00,829
Mrs Organ was the wife of the local vicar,
Jack Organ.

685
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:02,839
'Bessie always delivers my birds.

686
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:04,769
Didn't you know that?'

687
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:09,210
'I don't know anything,' I said.

688
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,680
'Bessie's a clever girl,' Charlie said.

689
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,960
We were driving through the village now and
the street lamps were still on and the men

690
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,349
were wandering home from the pub.

691
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:24,460
'The vicar loves a roast pheasant,' Claud
said.

692
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,499
The taxi turned left and went in through the
gates of the vicar's house.

693
00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:32,770
There were no lights on there, and nobody
met us.

694
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:37,450
Claud and I put the pheasants in the hut behind
the house, and then we said goodbye to Charlie

695
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,690
Kinch and walked back in the moonlight to
the petrol station.

696
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:47,289
I don't know whether or not Mr Rabbetts was
watching us as we went in.

697
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:50,779
'Here she comes,' Claud said to me the next
morning.

698
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:51,989
'Who?'

699
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:55,059
'Bessie - Bessie Organ.'

700
00:36:55,059 --> 00:37:00,420
He spoke the name proudly, as if he were a
general referring to his bravest officer.

701
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,190
'Down there,' he said, pointing.

702
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:09,119
Far away down the road, I could see a small
female figure advancing towards us.

703
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,809
'What's she pushing?'

704
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:12,000
I asked.

705
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,069
'There's only one safe way of delivering pheasants,'
he announced, 'and that's under a baby.'

706
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:21,539
'Yes,' I said.

707
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,190
'Of course.'

708
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:27,729
'That'll be young Christopher Organ in the
pram, aged one and a half years.

709
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:31,239
He's a lovely child, Gordon.'

710
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:35,240
I could just see the small face of a baby
sitting up high in the pram.

711
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:42,319
'There are sixty or seventy pheasants at least
under that little lad,' Claud said happily.

712
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:44,269
'Just imagine that.'

713
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:48,920
'You can't fit sixty or seventy pheasants
into a pram,' I said.

714
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,700
'You can if it's got a good, deep space underneath
it, and if you pack them in tightly, right

715
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,299
up to the top.

716
00:37:56,299 --> 00:37:58,509
All you need is a sheet.

717
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:03,369
You'd be surprised how little room a pheasant
takes up when it's asleep.'

718
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:07,259
We waited by the pumps for Bessie Organ to
arrive.

719
00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:12,869
It was one of those warm, windless September
mornings, with a darkening sky and a smell

720
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:15,420
of thunder in the air.

721
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,210
'Right through the village,' Claud said.

722
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,309
'Good old Bessie.'

723
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:22,839
'She seems in rather a hurry to me.'

724
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:26,099
Claud lit a new cigarette.

725
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,920
'Bessie is never in a hurry,' he said.

726
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,489
'She certainly isn't walking slowly,' I told
him.

727
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:34,489
'Look.'

728
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:37,319
He looked at her through the smoke of his
cigarette.

729
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:41,099
Then he took the cigarette out of his mouth
and looked again.

730
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:42,099
'Well?'

731
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:43,739
I said.

732
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:50,259
'She does seem to be going rather quickly,
doesn't she?' he said carefully.

733
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:53,979
'She's going very quickly.'

734
00:38:53,979 --> 00:38:55,210
There was a pause.

735
00:38:55,210 --> 00:39:00,400
Claud was beginning to stare very hard at
the approaching woman.

736
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,310
'Perhaps she doesn't want to get caught in
the rain, Gordon.

737
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:09,890
She thinks it's going to rain, and she doesn't
want the baby to get wet.'

738
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:13,070
'She's running,' I cried.

739
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,070
'Look!'

740
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:18,020
Bessie had suddenly started to run at top
speed.

741
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:22,849
Claud stood very still, watching the woman;
and in the silence that followed, I thought

742
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:25,010
I could hear a baby screaming.

743
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:29,249
'There's something wrong with that baby,'
I said.

744
00:39:29,249 --> 00:39:30,249
'Listen.'

745
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:36,269
At this point, Bessie was about two hundred
meters away from us, but was approaching fast.

746
00:39:36,269 --> 00:39:37,470
'Can you hear him now?'

747
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,470
I said.

748
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,680
'He's screaming his head off.'

749
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,229
The small, high voice in the distance was
growing louder every second.

750
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:47,349
'Perhaps the baby's ill.

751
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:51,869
There are a thousand and one things that can
happen to little babies like that,' Claud

752
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:52,869
said.

753
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:54,240
'Of course.'

754
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,989
'Whatever it is,' he continued, 'I wish she'd
stop running.'

755
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:05,479
A long lorry loaded with bricks came up beside
Bessie, and the driver slowed down and put

756
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:08,289
his head out of the window to stare.

757
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:13,609
Bessie ran on, and she was so close now that
I could see her big red face, with the mouth

758
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:16,440
wide open, breathing heavily.

759
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,450
Suddenly, out of the pram, straight up into
the air, flew an enormous pheasant.

760
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:26,209
Claud let out a cry of terror.

761
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:30,500
The fool in the lorry going along beside Bessie
roared with laughter.

762
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,420
The pheasant flew around sleepily for a few
seconds, then it lost height and landed in

763
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,359
the grass by the side of the road.

764
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:41,239
Bessie kept on running.

765
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:45,089
Then a second pheasant flew up out of the
pram.

766
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:47,890
Then a third and a fourth.

767
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:48,890
Then a fifth.

768
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,500
'My God!'

769
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,200
I said.

770
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,859
'It's the pills!

771
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:56,670
They've stopped working!'

772
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,010
Bessie covered the last fifty meters at a
great speed, and she came running up to the

773
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:05,440
petrol station with birds flying up out of
the pram in all directions.

774
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,839
'What's going on?'

775
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,460
she cried.

776
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,489
'Go round the back!'

777
00:41:10,489 --> 00:41:12,089
I shouted.

778
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:16,410
But she stopped beside the first pump in the
line, and before we could reach her she had

779
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:20,690
seized the screaming baby in her arms and
dragged him out of the pram.

780
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,690
'No!

781
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,690
No!'

782
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,250
Claud cried, running towards her.

783
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,940
'Don't lift the baby!

784
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,760
Put him back!

785
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,579
Hold down the sheet!'

786
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:34,819
But she wasn't even listening, and as the
weight of the child was suddenly lifted away,

787
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:40,309
a great cloud of pheasants rose up out of
the pram - forty or fifty of them at least

788
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:46,710
- and the whole sky above us was filled with
huge brown birds beating their wings madly

789
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,190
to gain height.

790
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:54,009
Claud and I started running up and down, waving
our arms to frighten them away.

791
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:55,059
'Go away!'

792
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:56,059
we shouted.

793
00:41:56,059 --> 00:41:57,059
'Shoo!

794
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,510
Go away!'

795
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:03,339
But they were too drugged still to take any
notice of us, and within half a minute they

796
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:09,269
had come down again and settled themselves
all over the front of my petrol station.

797
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:11,769
The place was covered with them.

798
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:17,009
They sat wing to wing along the edges of the
roof and a dozen, at least, were sitting on

799
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:19,369
the office window sill.

800
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:23,339
Others were sliding about on top of my second-hand
cars.

801
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:28,500
One bird with a fine tail was sitting on top
of a petrol pump, and quite a number sat at

802
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,210
our feet, shaking their feathers.

803
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:37,670
Across the road, a line of cars had already
started forming behind the brick lorry, and

804
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:41,779
people were opening their doors and getting
out and beginning to cross over to have a

805
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:43,640
closer look.

806
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,390
I glanced at my watch.

807
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,299
It was twenty to nine.

808
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:52,950
At any moment now, I thought, a large black
car is going to come along the road from the

809
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:59,299
direction of the village, and the car will
be a Rolls-Royce, and the face behind the

810
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:05,089
wheel will be the great shiny brewer's face
of Mr Victor Hazel.

811
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:08,400
'They attacked him!'

812
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,839
Bessie was shouting, holding the screaming
baby to her chest.

813
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:16,719
'You go on home, Bessie,' Claud said, white
in the face.

814
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,719
'Lock up,' I said.

815
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:18,719
'Put out the sign.

816
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:19,719
We've gone for the day.'

817
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:19,721
- THE END -
