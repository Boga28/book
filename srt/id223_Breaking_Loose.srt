1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:09,010
Where do we come from, where do we belong,
where is home?

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,150
Easy questions, but the answers are not always
so simple.

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,650
Family, culture, history - all these things
connect in different and mysterious ways.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,590
An Asian girl and an African man meet at a
university dance in an African country.

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:48,940
It is the girl's home town, and the man is
a visitor from another country.

6
00:00:48,940 --> 00:01:08,090
Who is the foreigner here... and does it matter?

7
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,100
A band called Iblis was playing on the stage.

8
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:19,930
The singer and guitarist was a young Asian
with long hair, now singing another popular

9
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,830
foreign song.

10
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,910
Close to the stage danced a group of fashionable,
brightly dressed girls.

11
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:33,130
Their wild way of dancing seemed to say that
they were the girlfriends of the four young

12
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,520
men in the band.

13
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,620
Yasmin was at the far end of the dance floor
with her girlfriends.

14
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:49,300
She and two of the girls were standing, because
there weren't enough chairs.

15
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:55,090
Sometimes she looked round at the dancers
and the band, hoping to see an empty chair

16
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,060
that she could bring over.

17
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,735
The band was loud, the room was hot and airless,
and everyone was sweating.

18
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:10,720
A 
well-dressed black man in a grey suit appeared

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,940
out of the crowd of dancers.

20
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,640
He came up to her and asked her to dance.

21
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
She went.

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,410
Of all the girls here, why me?

23
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,770
I don't want to dance.

24
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,750
I can't dance, she thought.

25
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:35,030
From the centre of the dance floor she looked
back sadly at her friends, who were talking

26
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,170
and laughing in the distance.

27
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,040
'I'm sorry,' he smiled.

28
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,880
'I took you away from your friends.'

29
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:53,730
'It's okay... only for a few minutes-' she
began, and blushed, realizing that was not

30
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,170
a polite answer.

31
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,860
After all, I should be pleased, she thought.

32
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,000
He's a professor.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,900
It was a dance that did not need any closeness
or touching - and she was grateful for that.

34
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,650
'Daniel Akoto.

35
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,650
That's my name.'

36
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,780
'I know... I'm Yasmin Rajan.'

37
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,940
It's all so unnecessary, she thought.

38
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,930
I'm not the type.

39
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:34,320
Why didn't he dance with one of those girls
near the stage?

40
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,210
She looked at him.

41
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,140
He danced much better than she did.

42
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,180
She was shorter than him.

43
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:49,860
Her long hair was brushed straight back from
her face, and she wore a simple dress.

44
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,720
This was the middle of her second year at
the university.

45
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,360
'Good music,' he said.

46
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,280
'Yes, isn't it?

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
I know the singer-'

48
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,410
'But too Western, don't you think?'

49
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,019
'I don't know...'

50
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,140
She felt uncomfortable with the conversation.

51
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:21,469
There was the little worry too - why had he
chosen her, and would he want to see her again?

52
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:26,490
He was looking at her and still talking.

53
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,520
'... you're too westernized, you Asians.

54
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:39,449
You like Western ways, European ways, even
more than we Africans do.'

55
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:44,370
She didn't know what to reply, and felt very
embarrassed.

56
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:50,699
He went on, shaking his head, 'Just listen
to that song!

57
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,169
Rolling Stones.

58
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:55,969
What do you call Indian in that?

59
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:58,289
Or am I missing something?'

60
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:01,849
Oh, why doesn't he stop?

61
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,029
she thought.

62
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:06,990
'What do you mean, we're westernized?'

63
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,469
she said angrily.

64
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:11,909
'Of course we have our own culture.

65
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:14,770
We have centuries-old customs...'

66
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,419
She had stopped dancing and there were tears
in her eyes.

67
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:27,800
She felt under attack in the middle of the
two hundred people dancing around her.

68
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,050
She could feel their eyes burning into her,
seeing her embarrassment.

69
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,919
She left Akoto in the middle of the dance
floor and, with her back straight and her

70
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,759
head high, returned to her friends.

71
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,430
The next day she waited for her punishment.

72
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:56,370
A call to the university's head office, a
black mark for her rudeness to a professor

73
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,770
who was a visitor from another African country.

74
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:07,889
During lunch in the university restaurant
with her friends, she saw him standing at

75
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:10,860
the door, looking around the room.

76
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,159
She took a deep breath and waited.

77
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:23,050
His eyes found her and he hurried forward
between the tables, laughing and calling out

78
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,479
greetings to people as he passed.

79
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:35,490
When he arrived at her table, he found an
empty chair, sat down and looked at her.

80
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,409
'About last night...' he began.

81
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:44,520
The other girls picked up their plates and
left.

82
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,860
She laughed.

83
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,270
'You pushed them out,' she said.

84
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,099
'They'll hate you for that.'

85
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:57,559
She wondered where she had found the confidence
to speak like that to him.

86
00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:03,139
He was in a red shirt - expensive, she thought.

87
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:09,059
He looked handsome - and harmless.

88
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:13,110
'But not for long, I hope,' he began.

89
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,999
His smile grew wider as he looked at her.

90
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:19,810
'I've come to apologize.

91
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:26,900
I asked you for a dance and then I bored you
with all those ideas of mine.'

92
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,490
'It's okay.

93
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,979
It's my fault too.

94
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:32,669
You see...'

95
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:36,060
'I know, I know.

96
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,659
An innocent Indian girl having to dance with
a man!

97
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:49,580
But tell me - don't you expect men to ask
you to dance when you're in a dance hall with

98
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,150
music playing?'

99
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,249
She smiled, a little embarrassed.

100
00:07:55,249 --> 00:08:02,620
'Having girlfriends with you usually means
that strangers don't come and ask...'

101
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,479
'Oh dear!

102
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,689
I'm a foreigner, so I didn't know that!

103
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:17,129
You came to have a good time with your friends
but you couldn't, because of me.

104
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,580
I'm really sorry.

105
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,830
Look, let me show you how sorry I am.

106
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,469
I'll take you for a drink.

107
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:28,459
How about that?'

108
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:33,500
'But I don't drink... alcohol, I mean.'

109
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,530
'Don't worry.

110
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,990
We'll find something for you.'

111
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:47,380
It was wrong of him to ask her, of course,
but she found she had accepted his invitation

112
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,470
without any worries.

113
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:59,450
When they met, as arranged, later that afternoon,
he said, 'I'll take you to The Matumbi.'

114
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:07,470
The Matumbi was a tea shop under a tree, half
a mile from the university.

115
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,930
It had a roof but no walls.

116
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,620
She went in slowly, feeling a little shy.

117
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,960
But Akoto was well known there, and the owner
pulled up two chairs at a table for them.

118
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,470
'Are you hungry?'

119
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,140
Akoto asked.

120
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,140
'No.

121
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,730
I'll just have tea... perhaps a small cake...'

122
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,040
'Right!

123
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:41,510
Two teas, one cake and one sikisti!' he called
out.

124
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,180
'What's a sikisti?'

125
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,470
she asked.

126
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,840
'It's a hot egg sandwich.

127
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,650
It's called sikisti because it costs sixty
cents!'

128
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,589
She laughed.

129
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:59,840
'It's true, believe me!'

130
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,430
Akoto was a professor of sociology, from Ghana.

131
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,920
'What are you studying?' he asked her, after
their tea.

132
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
'Literature.'

133
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,320
'Do you read any African writers?'

134
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,360
'Yes.

135
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,410
Soyinka...

136
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,450
Achebe...'

137
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,390
'Things fall apart...' he said.

138
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,950
'The center cannot hold.'

139
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,340
She finished the words for him.

140
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,230
He laughed.

141
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,770
'What about Ngugi?

142
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,230
Palangyo?

143
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,690
Omari?'

144
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,520
She shook her head.

145
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,760
She hadn't heard of them.

146
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,970
'New, local writers.

147
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,750
You should read Nuru Omari.

148
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,600
Wait for Me, that's her first book.

149
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,980
I could lend it to you if you want.'

150
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,350
'It's okay.

151
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,610
I'll borrow it from the library.'

152
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,340
He looked very surprised.

153
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,000
'But it'll take a long time for the library
to get it.'

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,730
'I'll wait...

155
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,730
I don't have much time right now.'

156
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,730
'All right.'

157
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,730
He was annoyed.

158
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:23,450
At last, when he saw that she was a little
restless, he said, 'Well, now that I've apologized,

159
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,610
I hope...

160
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,800
Well, perhaps we can go.'

161
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,481
I am studying literature and I have no time
to read the most recent books, she thought.

162
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:38,520
She felt ashamed.

163
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:46,800
When she saw him again several days later,
he did not appear to notice her.

164
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,570
He knows I'm not interested, she thought.

165
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,130
So why did I go to the tea shop with him?...

166
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,220
Because he's so different, so confident, so
intelligent...

167
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,090
He's a real gentleman!

168
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,620
Ah, that's it!

169
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,480
He said we Asians are westernized, but what
about him?

170
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,170
He's a perfect English gentleman himself!

171
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,780
I'll tell him that!

172
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:24,550
'Dear Professor Akoto,' she wrote, 'I wanted
to tell you something.

173
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,110
You called us Asians westernized.

174
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,810
Well, have you looked at yourself recently?

175
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:37,580
Your language, your clothes - a suit even
in hot weather - you are just like an English

176
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,580
gentleman yourself!

177
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,870
Yours sincerely, Yasmin Rajan.

178
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,000
P.S.

179
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,210
Could I borrow Omari's Wait for Me from you
after all?

180
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,130
Thanks.'

181
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,620
She put the note under his office door.

182
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,890
The next day he came to find her at lunchtime
again.

183
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,500
'You're quite right,' he said.

184
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,030
'Although I'm not sure I completely agree...

185
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,320
But let's not argue.

186
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,190
Let me show you my library.

187
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,770
You can borrow any book you like.'

188
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:23,990
He took her to his house, and when he opened
the door of his sitting room, her eyes opened

189
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,760
wide in surprise.

190
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,740
Three of the walls were covered with books.

191
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,480
She had never before seen so many books which
belonged to one person.

192
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,100
'You've read all these books?'

193
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,260
she asked.

194
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,340
'Well...

195
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,150
I wouldn't...'

196
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,150
'Lucky you.

197
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,860
You must know so much!'

198
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,650
'Oh, not really.'

199
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,950
'Do you also write?'

200
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,950
'Yes.

201
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,990
But none of my writing is published yet.'

202
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:04,040
He had ideas about African literature.

203
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,290
'Today's writers are going back to their beginnings,
digging deep.

204
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:15,380
And that's what I'm trying to do - dig.

205
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:21,110
So you can understand why I worry about what's
real and what isn't.'

206
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,950
They went to The Matumbi that evening.

207
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,680
She had her first sikisti, and talked about
her family.

208
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:37,710
'My father had a pawnshop, but pawnshops are
no longer allowed, so now he has a shop which

209
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,650
makes men's clothes.

210
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:45,100
Tell me, do you think pawnshops are a bad
thing?'

211
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,150
'Well, I think they're bad for poor people.

212
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:53,020
They have to pay an awful lot to get their
things back.'

213
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,540
'But where can poor people borrow money from?

214
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,540
Not the banks!

215
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,360
And you should see the kind of things they
bring to the pawnshop.

216
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,840
Old watches, broken bicycles, sometimes clothes.

217
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,320
We have three old gramophones that we can't
sell.'

218
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,190
'Is that right?

219
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,310
Can I look at them?

220
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,810
Perhaps I'll buy one.

221
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,940
I like unfashionable old things.'

222
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:29,310
So one afternoon Yasmin took him to her father's
shop to show him the old gramophones.

223
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:37,070
He entered the shop alone, while Yasmin went
round to the back of the building, where the

224
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,560
family lived.

225
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,640
Her father came to meet Akoto.

226
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,390
'Come in, Bwana.

227
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,520
What can I get for you?'

228
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,810
'I came with Yasmin,' Akoto explained in his
bad Swahili.

229
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,550
'For a gramophone...'

230
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,680
'Ah, yes!

231
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,790
The professor!

232
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,800
Sit, Bwana, sit.'

233
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:06,690
While Yasmin's father showed Akoto the gramophones,
Yasmin was inside the house, talking to her

234
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,260
mother.

235
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:15,350
'How can you bring him here like this?' said
her mother angrily.

236
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,960
'What will the neighbours think?

237
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,240
I'm so ashamed!'

238
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,200
'But Mummy, he is a professor!'

239
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:29,330
'I don't care if he's a professor's father!'

240
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:34,529
By the time Akoto had left the shop, with
his gramophone, Yasmin's mother was wild with

241
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:35,529
anger.

242
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:42,200
'You do not have friendships with men - not
with men who we don't know.'

243
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,790
'The world is not ready for it,' said Yasmin's
father quietly.

244
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,990
'You stay out of it!'

245
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,310
his wife screamed.

246
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:56,620
'This is between Yasmin and me!'

247
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:04,319
Yasmin knew her father would discuss things
sensibly, but her mother never stopped warning

248
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,819
her, and punishing her, and expecting the
worst, just because she was a girl.

249
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,309
Yasmin's three brothers did not have this
problem.

250
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:16,149
'What do you know of him?

251
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:22,659
With an Asian man, even if he's very bad,
you know what to expect.

252
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:25,129
But with him?'

253
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:29,119
Her mother went on shouting and screaming
like this for hours.

254
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:34,970
By the end of the day Yasmin felt half dead
with tiredness.

255
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:42,860
It was more than a week before she and Akoto
met again.

256
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,169
'Where do you eat lunch these days?' he said,
smiling.

257
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:50,289
'You're the perfect salesman.

258
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:51,330
You sell me an old gramophone and disappear.

259
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:57,289
Are you afraid I'll return it?'

260
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:05,110
She said something polite, and walked quickly
away.

261
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:10,320
Later she returned the books that she had
borrowed from him, and refused an invitation

262
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,470
to The Matumbi.

263
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:20,059
She did not go to the end-of-year dance, but
her friends told her what happened there.

264
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:26,129
Professor Akoto sat alone at a table for a
while, and drank quite a lot.

265
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:31,179
He got into a fight with Mr Sharp of the Boys'
School.

266
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:35,200
Then he left.

267
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,130
India was not just the past, or the close
circle of family, neighbours, and friends.

268
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:49,369
India was a place, a culture, one of the great
nations of the world.

269
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:54,330
And during the holidays Yasmin discovered
India.

270
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:59,369
She read endlessly, and asked her father about
it.

271
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:01,490
Here in Africa she was an Asian, an Indian.

272
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:09,529
But up to now she had known almost nothing
about India.

273
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:17,100
At first, her search for her own past seemed
to put a distance between her and Akoto, the

274
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,200
African.

275
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,840
But this was what he had talked about - digging
deep, finding what was real.

276
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,999
So in a strange way her search also brought
her closer to him.

277
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:39,070
The world seemed a smaller place when she
went back to university.

278
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:46,600
Smaller but exciting; full of people doing
their best, fighting, loving, staying alive.

279
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,730
And she was one of those people.

280
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,460
People who were locked into their own histories
and customs were like prisoners, she thought.

281
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:04,960
But sometimes the old patterns were broken,
and things changed - lives changed, the world

282
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
changed.

283
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,029
She was part of that change, she decided.

284
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:15,909
A month later Yasmin's father was lifting
boxes in his shop when he felt a pain in his

285
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:16,909
heart.

286
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:23,770
The doctor was called, but arrived late, and
by then Yasmin's father was dead.

287
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,769
Daniel Akoto came to the funeral.

288
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:34,490
He sat on the ground among the men, sweating
and uncomfortable, trying to sit with his

289
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,100
legs crossed.

290
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:42,649
A black face in a sea of patient brown Asian
faces.

291
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:48,269
Someone saw how uncomfortable he was and put
out a chair for him by the wall.

292
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:53,230
From there Akoto could see clearly across
the room.

293
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,700
Mrs Rajan sat beside the dead man, crying.

294
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:04,720
When she looked up, she saw Akoto through
her tears, and lost control.

295
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
'You!'

296
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
she screamed.

297
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,049
'What are you doing here?

298
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:19,279
What kind of man are you, who comes to take
away my daughter, even in my sadness?

299
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,669
Who asked you to come?

300
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:23,669
Go away!'

301
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:24,669
People turned to stare.

302
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:25,870
Akoto gave an apologetic smile.

303
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:31,399
'Go!' said the woman wildly, pointing a finger
at the door.

304
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:35,200
No one else said a word.

305
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:43,369
Akoto stood up, bent his head respectfully
towards the dead man and left the room.

306
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:50,620
A week later Yasmin knocked at his door late
in the evening and found him in.

307
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,399
'Come in,' he said, putting away his pipe.

308
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:59,429
'I've come to apologize for what happened
at the funeral.'

309
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:02,139
'It's all right.

310
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:08,710
People aren't at their best at a funeral...
but perhaps they're more honest.'

311
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,369
He watched her face carefully.

312
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:15,980
'You must think we're awful.

313
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,299
You're a professor - you know so much - you're
a great man...'

314
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:26,140
'No, I don't think you're awful.

315
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,160
And don't call me a great man!'

316
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,139
She began to laugh, a little wildly.

317
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:34,700
They both laughed.

318
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,960
'And you, I respect you.'

319
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,360
He spoke calmly.

320
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,770
'You are brave.

321
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:52,600
You left that crowd of girls that day at the
dance, and since then you've done it again

322
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,940
and again.

323
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,390
It's brave, what you've done.

324
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:07,131
Trying to break away from family, friends,
the old customs, the old ways... trying to

325
00:23:07,131 --> 00:23:09,350
find your own path in life...

326
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,240
Even coming here like this.

327
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,739
I realize that and I like you.'

328
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:21,419
'Well, I like you too!'

329
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,470
she said, too quickly.

330
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,890
There was a silence between them.

331
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:36,190
'You know, it's not going to be easy... with
my father dead, this will be the most terrible

332
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,340
news for my mother...

333
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,679
it will kill her, it will...'

334
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,769
Tears were running down her face.

335
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:47,220
'Now, now.'

336
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,330
He went up to her, put her wet face on his
shirt.

337
00:23:52,330 --> 00:24:23,940
'We'll have to do the best we can, won't we?'
