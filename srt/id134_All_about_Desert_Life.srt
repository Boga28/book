00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,560
CHAPTER ONE
What is a Desert

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:15,020
A desert is a dry place that has less than
25 centimeters of rain every year.

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,860
Some deserts have no rain for months or years.

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,340
Some deserts have sand, but others have stones
or rocks.

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,530
Some deserts are in the mountains.

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:35,719
In the day, temperatures in hot deserts are
usually from 20 to 35 degrees centigrade,

7
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,780
but temperatures can be more than 50 degrees.

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,859
At night, the air gets very cold.

9
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,500
Sometimes, it's less than 0 degrees.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:55,079
Most cold deserts are warm in summer, but
they are very cold in winter.

11
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:02,709
In summer, temperatures are usually from 21
to 26 degrees centigrade.

12
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:07,670
In winter, they are usually from 2 to 4 degrees.

13
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,830
Most of the water in cold deserts comes from
snow or fog.

14
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,390
It doesn't come from rain.

15
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:26,299
It snows in Antarctica, but this only makes
about 5 centimeters of water every year.

16
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:32,680
It's the biggest and coldest desert on Earth.

17
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,560
CHAPTER TWO
Different Deserts

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,390
More than 20 percent of the land on Earth
is desert.

19
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,700
There are many different deserts.

20
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,960
The Sahara Desert, in North Africa, is the
biggest hot desert on Earth.

21
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,880
It's 9 million square kilometers - that's
about as big as the USA!

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,030
The Sahara has sand dunes, rocks, and mountains.

23
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:10,300
Some of the sand dunes are 180 meters tall.

24
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,880
The Sahara has very strong winds that make
big sandstorms.

25
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,440
The sandstorms can take plants and animals
into the air!

26
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,790
The Atacama Desert is in Peru and Chile.

27
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,440
It's not very hot, and it's one of the oldest
and driest deserts on Earth.

28
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,970
It has less than 1 millimeter of rain every
year!

29
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:47,950
Scientists think that at one time, it didn't
rain here for 400 years.

30
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,900
There aren't many deserts in Europe.

31
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,900
There's one small desert in Spain.

32
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,260
It's called the Tabernas Desert.

33
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,830
The Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and China.

34
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:10,710
It's 1,300,000 square kilometers and it's
in the mountains.

35
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,250
Most of the land is rock.

36
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,200
It's one of the coldest deserts on Earth.

37
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:25,280
In winter, the temperature can be minus 40
degrees centigrade!

38
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,550
CHAPTER THREE
Plants

39
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:36,760
Deserts are very dry places, but plants can
still grow there.

40
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,620
Desert plants collect and use water in special
ways.

41
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:48,510
The cactus has big roots, so it can collect
water fast when it rains.

42
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,900
It stores water in its stem for when there
isn't any rain.

43
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,940
Many cactus plants have spikes.

44
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:07,260
The spikes also collect water, and they stop
animals eating the plant.

45
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:14,370
There are about 1,200 different types of plant
in the Sahara Desert.

46
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,340
The welwitschia plant gets water from fog.

47
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,210
The leaves collect the water and it goes down
into the soil.

48
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,610
Then the plant takes up the water with its
roots.

49
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,720
The baobab tree grows in the deserts in Africa
and Australia.

50
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,600
It can store thousands of liters of water.

51
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,290
Some baobab trees are more than 9 meters across!

52
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,900
Desert people can drink the water from this
tree.

53
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,280
The seeds of many desert plants can stay in
the soil for a long time.

54
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,210
When it rains, they grow fast and produce
flowers.

55
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:09,150
Then they die, but they leave seeds for the
next time it rains.

56
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,210
CHAPTER FOUR
Animals

57
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:20,670
It's hard to live in the desert, but deserts
are homes for many different animals.

58
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:26,780
Insects, like ants, can live underground when
it's hot.

59
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,520
They put their eggs underground, too.

60
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,450
Insects are important because bigger animals
need them for food.

61
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,980
Spiders and scorpions are arachnids.

62
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,510
Many desert arachnids are poisonous.

63
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:51,860
They use their poison to catch insects and
other small animals.

64
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:58,290
Mammals are animals that drink milk from their
mother when they are young.

65
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:07,419
Many desert mammals can live for days with
no water because they can get water from plants.

66
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:14,310
Desert jerboas make water in their body when
they eat dry seeds and roots!

67
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:22,300
Reptiles, like snakes, lizards, and desert
tortoises, have a thick skin.

68
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,890
This helps their body to save water.

69
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:37,680
Most reptiles get food and water from other
animals, but desert tortoises eat plants.

70
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,800
Some deserts even have fish.

71
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:49,310
Pupfish live in small rivers in the deserts
in North America.

72
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:56,020
CHAPTER FIVE
Day and Night

73
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:04,790
In deserts around the world, different animals
come out at different times.

74
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,690
Reptiles come out in the morning to get warm
in the sun.

75
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,310
Lizards lie on rocks to get warm.

76
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,190
They lie in the shade when it's too hot.

77
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,860
Desert tortoises look for food in the morning.

78
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:30,330
At night, they stay in their burrows so that
they are warm and safe from other animals.

79
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,270
Many desert birds also come out in the day.

80
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:40,790
In the morning, they look for spiders, insects,
and seeds.

81
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:46,430
Most desert animals sleep in the day and come
out at night.

82
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,040
Many small animals sleep in burrows.

83
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:57,050
Bigger animals, like foxes, sleep in big holes
called dens.

84
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,979
At night, scorpions look for food.

85
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:07,030
Scorpions have tiny hairs on their legs.

86
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:13,680
The hairs help the scorpions to feel other
animals moving.

87
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:22,850
Some animals, like desert cats and owls, have
special eyes to help them to see well at night.

88
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:31,870
Owls can also hear very well, so they know
when animals are moving.

89
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:37,199
CHAPTER SIX
People

90
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:44,229
About 13% of all the people in the world live
in deserts.

91
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:48,800
Some people lived in deserts a long time ago.

92
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,580
Aborigines were the first people of Australia.

93
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,210
They lived in the deserts in Australia more
than 40,000 years ago!

94
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,959
Aborigines use art to tell stories.

95
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:12,339
Many Aborigines live in cities today, but
some are going back to their traditional life

96
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,569
in the desert.

97
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:22,089
Tuareg people lived in the Sahara Desert more
than 2,000 years ago.

98
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:28,720
They are called the blue people because of
the color of their clothes.

99
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,140
Traditional Tuaregs travel across the desert
on camels.

100
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:39,160
They live in tents made from animal skins
and wood.

101
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,600
Many Tuaregs have farms, and others work in
cities.

102
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,699
Bedouin people lived in the deserts hundreds
of years ago.

103
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:55,660
They live in the Middle East and North Africa.

104
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,880
Traditional Bedouins are traveling farmers.

105
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,560
They live in tents or mud houses.

106
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,319
Today, many Bedouins work in cities.

107
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:12,970
Some Bedouins make and sell things.

108
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,800
CHAPTER SEVEN
Water in the Desert

109
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Deserts are very dry places, but all deserts
have some water.

110
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:34,230
An oasis is a place where water from under
the ground makes a lake or pond.

111
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,790
Some oases are small, but some are very big.

112
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:48,510
The Siwa Oasis in Egypt is 80 kilometers long
and 20 kilometers across.

113
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,740
About 23,000 people live here.

114
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,350
Some deserts have rivers.

115
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,920
The Nile River travels through the Sahara
Desert.

116
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,260
Many people live near this river.

117
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,290
They can catch fish and use the water for
farming.

118
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,370
In some deserts, there are big rainstorms.

119
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,749
Then there's no more rain for a long time.

120
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:21,939
So it's very important to collect rainwater.

121
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:32,779
In the Thar Desert, people collect water in
ponds, wells, and big tanks.

122
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:38,529
People in some cold deserts use nets to collect
the water from fog.

123
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:46,980
Each net can catch about 14 liters of water
every day.

124
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:53,029
CHAPTER EIGHT
Staying Cool

125
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:58,029
Many people and animals live in hot deserts.

126
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:02,879
They have different ways to stay cool.

127
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,439
Desert people use their clothes and houses
to stay cool.

128
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:16,990
Bedouin and Tuareg people wear long clothes
to protect them from the hot sun and the wind.

129
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,180
They wear a head cloth to protect their head
and face.

130
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:29,720
People in deserts build houses with small
windows so that it stays cool inside.

131
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,470
This keeps out the sun and also the wind.

132
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,329
Some desert houses have no windows!

133
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:45,119
Many big desert animals stay in a cool place
in the day.

134
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:54,819
Oryxes make a cool hole to sit in, or they
sit in the shade.

135
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:58,679
Some desert lizards are called sand swimmers.

136
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:05,660
When it's hot, these lizards swim under the
sand to stay cool.

137
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:14,690
Some animals, like crocodiles, snakes, and
frogs, sleep in the hottest parts of summer.

138
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:23,769
Other animals, like desert tortoises, sleep
in winter in cold deserts.

139
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:30,019
CHAPTER NINE
Living in the Desert

140
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:37,579
Living in the desert is very different from
living in a city, but people still cook, travel,

141
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:40,129
and go to school.

142
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:48,939
Most desert people eat bread, porridge, milk,
cheese, and food from desert plants.

143
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:53,230
They cook their food on a fire outside their
home.

144
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,839
Dates grow well in deserts.

145
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:03,639
Dates with cheese is traditional Tuareg food.

146
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:10,920
Every year, there's a festival in the Sahara
Desert, near Timbuktu in Mali.

147
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,869
There are three days of music, dancing, and
camel racing.

148
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:27,149
Today, many desert people drive SUVs, but
camels are better for traveling across sand!

149
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:32,200
Camels can travel more than 40 kilometers
in a day.

150
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,509
They are strong animals.

151
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:43,209
Desert people can use camels to carry food,
tents, and other things from their homes.

152
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:50,899
A long time ago, only a few desert children
went to school, but this is changing.

153
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:56,850
In the deserts in Australia, Aborigines are
building new schools.

154
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:04,889
Students speak their own language, and they
also learn English.

155
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:11,149
CHAPTER TEN
Desertification

156
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,810
Deserts are getting bigger.

157
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:21,519
Every year, the land around many deserts gets
dry and changes into new desert.

158
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,579
This is called desertification.

159
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:31,089
The land can get too dry when there's no rain
for a long time.

160
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,730
Sometimes people also make the land dry.

161
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:42,550
When there are too many farms in one place,
animals eat all the plants, and the soil blows

162
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,170
away.

163
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:51,629
Then new plants can't grow and there isn't
food for everyone.

164
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:57,670
Desertification is a big problem in countries
in Africa near the Sahara Desert.

165
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:07,129
In 50 years, these countries have lost 650,000
square kilometers of land - that's about the

166
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:11,429
same size as France.

167
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:17,899
Millions of people here are hungry, because
they can't grow food in the desert.

168
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:22,360
How can people help to stop desertification?

169
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,319
In many countries, people are growing more
trees.

170
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,589
Trees stop the soil blowing away.

171
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:38,470
In China, people are using a wall of trees
to stop desertification near the Gobi Desert.

172
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:45,659
The wall is 4,000 kilometers long!

173
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:49,729
- THE END -
