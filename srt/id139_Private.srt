00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,360
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,560
At the Golden Globes

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,760
Jack Morgan got out of his dark blue 
Lamborghini near the Beverly Hilton.  

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:24,320
It was the night of the Golden Globes, and he 
was with a beautiful and famous movie star.  

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:37,040
He helped Guinevere Scott-Evans out of the car, 
and she held his hand hard. Guinevere trusted  

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:47,680
Jack, and she trusted his company, Private. 
Everyone trusted Private; it was the best.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,080
But then Jack's oldest friend, 
Andy Cushman, called him.

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:06,240
Andy spoke quickly. "Jack, come 
to my house now! I need you."

9
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,160
"It's not a good time. What's wrong?" asked Jack.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,800
"It's Shelby. She's dead," said Andy. 
Shelby and Andy married six months ago.

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:38,800
Guinevere wasn't happy, but Jack took her to 
her table. Then, he was on the road to Andy's  

12
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:48,080
house in Bluffs. He stopped near the open 
front door, took out his gun, and went in.

13
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,080
"Andy?" shouted Jack.

14
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,040
"Jack! I'm in the bedroom."

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:08,880
Jack went through the house, his gun in his hand. 
In the bedroom, there were clothes everywhere.  

16
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,600
Shelby was on the bed, with blood on her head.

17
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,240
"What happened?" asked Jack.

18
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:31,600
Andy was near Shelby, his head in his 
hands. "Someone shot her. Please find him!"

19
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:41,360
Jack took photos of everything in the 
room. "Did you call the police?" he asked.

20
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,200
"No, I wanted you here," said Andy.

21
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,760
"Do you have a gun?" asked Jack.

22
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
"No," said Andy.

23
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:08,400
"OK, you must understand. The police will want 
to talk to you. They always want it to be easy.  

24
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:20,000
They will think, 'A woman is dead - did her 
husband kill her?' But I can help," said Jack.

25
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,760
He called the police and waited 
for them to arrive.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

26
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,320
CHAPTER TWO

27
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,200
A young woman dies

28
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,160
Justine worked with Jack at 
Private. People trusted her, too.  

29
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:53,280
Tonight, she was in an expensive Italian 
restaurant. Then, the chief of police called her.

30
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,160
"Another young woman is dead," 
Justine told her friend. "I must go."

31
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:13,840
In two years, eleven young women in Los 
Angeles were dead. Now, it was twelve.  

32
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:22,480
The killer always took something from 
the women - hair, a necklace, clothes.  

33
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,120
Then, the killer emailed the chief of police 
and told him about the women's things.  

34
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:43,680
Nobody knew where the emails came from, but 
the emails all had the same name - Steemcleena.  

35
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,640
The police found the women's things, 
but they couldn't find Steemcleena.  

36
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:00,320
The police wanted Justine, and 
Private, to help them find the killer.

37
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:11,600
Emilio Cruz, from Private, stopped his Mercedes 
at the restaurant door, and Justine got in.  

38
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,840
"What do you know about this girl?" asked Justine.

39
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:31,920
"Her name is Connie Yu. She was sixteen and very 
intelligent," said Emilio. "She was on the ground  

40
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:40,240
behind a restaurant. There was an earring 
in her left ear. There was no right ear."

41
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,720
Emilio stopped in a small, dark street  

42
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,600
near some police cars. They walked past 
the police and spoke to the doctor.

43
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,440
"We'll get an email about the ear 
in a day or two," Emilio said.

44
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,480
At 2 a.m., Justine and Emilio 
were at Private's offices.  

45
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,160
They talked to Sci, Private's forensic expert.  

46
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:26,720
"We have the woman's bag and cell phone," 
said Justine. "Can you look for DNA on them?"

47
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,720
"Of course," said Sci. "I can 
work all night on it."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

48
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,200
CHAPTER THREE

49
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,040
At Private

50
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:53,280
The next morning, Justine, Emilio, Sci, and 
Mo-bot, the computer expert, were in the office.

51
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:05,040
Jack opened his laptop and showed them the photos 
from Andy's bedroom. "Look at these," he said.  

52
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,320
"I can't see anything important. Can you?"

53
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,680
"Did the killer take anything 
from the house?" asked Justine.

54
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,360
"No, he took nothing," said Jack.

55
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,680
"And were Andy and Shelby 
happy together?" asked Emilio.

56
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,720
"Yes," said Jack. "Very happy."

57
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:48,640
"OK," said Justine. "This killer is a 
professional. But why did he kill Shelby?"

58
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,000
"The police always like easy answers.  

59
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:03,920
They will think one thing: Andy killed 
her," said Emilio. "Did Andy kill her?"

60
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:13,760
"No, he didn't," said Jack. "I 
know Andy well. He loved Shelby."

61
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,880
"What next?" asked Mo-bot.

62
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,280
"We look at Andy and Shelby,"  

63
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:31,680
said Jack. "We talk to their friends 
and to people they work with. Let's go."

64
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,840
"Wait!" said Justine. "I have 
some news on the young woman.  

65
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:51,200
We have her bag. Sci couldn't find any 
new DNA, but Mo-bot looked at her phone."

66
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,920
"I looked at the text messages," 
said Mo-bot. "There were hundreds,  

67
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08,160
from twenty or thirty people. I looked 
at the numbers, and they are all  

68
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:18,960
friends or family. But there is one strange 
message - I can't get the number for it. Look!"

69
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,160
A text message came up on the wall.
 
 

70
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:37,920
Connie. It's Linda. My mom took my phone. 
I must talk to you. Can we meet? Please!  

71
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:47,040
Behind the restaurant. At 
8.30 p.m. Don't tell anyone.
 
 

72
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:56,560
"I talked to Linda," said Mo-bot. 
"Her mother didn't take her phone.  

73
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:08,000
Linda didn't send that message. The killer got 
into Connie's phone and found all her friends.  

74
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,080
Then, he sent her that message from his phone."

75
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:25,200
"But we can't find the number of the killer's 
phone," said Sci. "It isn't possible."

76
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,840
"Who is Steemcleena?" asked Jack.

77
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Rudolph Crocker left his office at 7 p.m. and 
went for a drink. At 9 p.m., he was at home and  

78
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:57,920
ready for a run. He ran out to Marina del Rey and 
thought about Connie Yu. That was a great evening.

79
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,000
There was nobody near him. He stopped near a boat  

80
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:13,840
and put something on it. Then, he went home 
and sent an email to the Chief of Police.

81
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:23,600
You can find Connie Yu's ear on a boat in 
Marina del Rey. Steemcleena.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

82
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,080
CHAPTER FOUR

83
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,560
Another young woman

84
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,160
Jason Pilser got a text message at work at 3 p.m.

85
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:48,720
Scylla, your big night is 
Saturday. Be ready. Steemcleena.

86
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,680
"Scylla" was Jason's computer 
name. At 6 p.m., he left his office  

87
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:08,240
and drove to a store. He bought some gloves and 
some electric cable. He didn't pay with a card,  

88
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:16,240
and he looked down at the ground. He didn't 
want the cameras in the store to see him.

89
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,520
The big night was in three days. He 
was ready to kill his first woman.

90
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,960
"I'm going for a walk!" Marguerite 
Esperanza shouted to her grandmother.  

91
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:44,160
It was Saturday evening. Marguerite walked 
out the house and on to Rowena Avenue.  

92
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,840
A text message came on to her phone.

93
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,000
Hi Marg. It's Lamar. Where are you?

94
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
She read it and answered.

95
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,960
I'm on Rowena.

96
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,000
Lamar was a really nice boy. Marguerite liked him.

97
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,360
Do you want to get a pizza? asked Lamar.

98
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,840
OK, Marguerite answered.

99
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,680
Marguerite called her grandmother.  

100
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:34,160
"I'm getting a pizza with Lamar," she said. 
"And he'll walk home with me. Is that OK?"

101
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,840
The black van was near Rowena 
Avenue. The driver was Steemcleena.  

102
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,880
Scylla and Morbid were in the back of the van.

103
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,680
"She's out of her house," said 
Morbid. He gave the laptop to Scylla.

104
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:05,440
Scylla wrote a message: Hi Marg. It's Lamar...

105
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,480
Marguerite answered. Scylla 
wrote another message. The van  

106
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:22,800
stopped near the pizza restaurant and waited. 
Then, they saw Marguerite in the street.

107
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:35,200
"Go!" shouted Morbid. Scylla got out of the 
van. He pulled a bag over Marguerite's head  

108
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:45,600
from behind, and he and Morbid threw her 
into the van. Steemcleena drove away quickly.

109
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,120
"Help!" shouted Marguerite.

110
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,840
"Be quiet!" shouted Morbid. 
"Maybe you can win the game."

111
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,160
"Win?" asked Marguerite. "What do you mean?"

112
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:19,360
Steemcleena stopped the van in a park, with nobody 
near. Morbid and Steemcleena were behind Scylla.  

113
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
This was Scylla's game.

114
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,360
Marguerite got out of the van quickly, 
and she pulled the bag off her head.  

115
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:41,920
She couldn't run away; Steemcleena and Morbid 
could stop her. But she was tall and strong,  

116
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,840
and ready for Scylla. Her hand 
flew out and hit him on the nose.

117
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:58,960
There was blood on Scylla's face 
now, and he was angry. He ran at her,  

118
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:08,000
but she kicked him hard in the 
stomach. And then she kicked him again.

119
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Steemcleena looked at Morbid. "She's too 
good for Scylla," he said. He took out a gun  

120
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:26,240
and shot Marguerite in the head. 
Then, Scylla put on the gloves  

121
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:35,840
and put the cable around the dead woman's neck. 
He took her shoes and put them in the van.

122
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:49,840
"That wasn't good," said Steemcleena to Scylla. 
"But maybe you'll win the next game."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

123
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,840
CHAPTER FIVE

124
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,800
Scylla's next game

125
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,320
Justine met Police Lieutenant Nora 
Cronin in the park at 4 a.m. on Sunday.  

126
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:12,720
"The Chief of Police is here," said 
Nora. "He wants to talk to you."

127
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:23,120
The Chief was with three police officers near 
Marguerite's body. Justine walked up to him.

128
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:34,960
"It's good to see you," he said. "We need 
your help. Thirteen women are dead. And look!  

129
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,400
Somebody shot her dead - so why 
is there cable around her neck?"

130
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,360
"It's very strange," said Justine. 
"And where's her handbag?"

131
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:02,800
"There's no handbag," said the Chief, 
"and no shoes. I'm waiting for the email."

132
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:13,840
On Sunday evening, Scylla was on the terrace of 
his apartment, at the top of a tall building.  

133
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:24,560
The city was beautiful at night, but he didn't 
look at it. His face and body were black and blue.  

134
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:34,720
"That girl was strong," he thought. Then, 
he read the message from Morbid again.

135
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,560
You weren't good yesterday, 
Scylla. Steemcleena isn't happy.  

136
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:53,120
But you can play again tonight. We have 
someone for you. Be ready at 7 p.m.

137
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,560
Morbid and Steemcleena were at the 
door now, and Scylla went to open it.

138
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,520
"How's the nose?" asked Morbid.

139
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,760
OK, said Scylla. "Do you want a drink?"

140
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:24,480
"No," said Steemcleena. "Let's go on the 
terrace. I want to show you something."

141
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:35,680
The three men walked on to the terrace and 
looked down at the city. Then, Steemcleena  

142
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:48,400
turned to Scylla. "You think you can play again?" 
he asked. "You can. But you're playing with us."

143
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,200
Steemcleena took Scylla's legs,  

144
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:00,160
and Morbid took his arms, and they 
threw him over the terrace wall.

145
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,240
Justine and Jack were at Private with 
Mo-bot. They talked about Marguerite.

146
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,760
"The killer sent an email," said Justine,  

147
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:25,120
"and we found her shoes. Sci is looking 
at them now, but they're probably clean."

148
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:38,000
"The killer is using a van to look for the young 
women, I think," said Mo-bot. "He has a laptop  

149
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:49,360
and a radio in the van, and he can send messages 
to the women's cell phones. He can stop messages  

150
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:59,520
to their phones from other people, too. And maybe 
he can find them in the street from their phones."

151
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,480
"Is that possible?" asked Jack.

152
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,160
"I don't know. I'll ask 
Sci about it," said Mo-bot.  

153
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,920
"His friend Kit-Kat knows about cell phones."

154
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,800
"I remembered something important,"  

155
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:33,440
said Justine. "Someone killed a woman about 
five years ago in the same street as Connie Yu.  

156
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:44,000
Her name was Wendy Borman. The killer 
took her phone. And her necklace."

157
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,040
"Five years ago!" said Jack.  

158
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:57,840
"Maybe it's not thirteen women. Maybe it's 
more! We have work to do!"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

159
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,560
CHAPTER SIX

160
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,240
An angry husband can kill

161
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,280
On Monday morning, Andy was at Private. 
Jack had something to tell him.

162
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:22,080
"I can't sleep," Andy said. "I 
think about Shelby all the time."

163
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:34,880
"Andy," said Jack. "We talked to a lot of people 
about Shelby. She had a lot of friends - you know  

164
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:47,120
that. And we found one very good friend. The movie 
star Bob Santangelo. She saw him every week."

165
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,480
"That's not true!" shouted Andy. "She loved me."

166
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:05,360
"Maybe she loved you," said Jack. "But she 
loved Santangelo, too. Did you know that?"

167
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,440
"No, I didn't!" shouted Andy. "It's not true!"

168
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,040
Andy left. Jack and Sci talked about Santangelo.

169
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,400
"Did Andy know about Santangelo?" asked Sci.

170
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,800
"I don't know," said Jack.

171
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,040
"An angry husband can kill, you know," said Sci.

172
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:49,840
"I know, Sci," said Jack. "But Andy's a good 
man, and he's my friend. He didn't kill Shelby."

173
00:23:51,520 --> 00:24:04,000
"I understand. You don't want to hear 
it," said Sci. "But maybe he did."

174
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,960
Justine was at the police station 
with Lieutenant Nora Cronin.

175
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:20,640
"I looked on the internet," said Justine, 
"but can you tell me more about Wendy Borman?"

176
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:32,160
"One thing isn't on the internet," said Nora. "An 
eleven-year-old girl called Christine Castiglia  

177
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:42,800
saw something. She and her mother were in a 
coffee shop on Melrose Avenue. Christine saw two  

178
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:52,240
boys push Wendy into a van. Her mother didn't 
see anything, and Christine didn't see a lot.  

179
00:24:53,360 --> 00:25:01,440
The boys were white. One had a long nose 
and big ears; the other had long hair."

180
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:14,080
"But Christine is sixteen now," said Justine. 
"We need to talk to her again."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

181
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,040
CHAPTER SEVEN

182
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,320
Help from Sci's friends

183
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,720
Sci lived in an apartment with a lot of computers.  

184
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,680
On Monday evening, he sat at a computer 
and talked to his friend Kit-Kat in Sweden.

185
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,840
"You asked about cell phones," 
said Kit-Kat. "I can help.  

186
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:53,680
Someone in the United States of America has a new 
program. It can find a phone and get inside it.  

187
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:02,640
Then, it can send messages from the 
phone. And nobody knows it is happening."

188
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:12,320
"That's great, Kit-Kat," said Sci. 
"Do you know who made this program?"

189
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,280
"His name is Morbid. He's American, I think."

190
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,840
"Thanks, Kit-Kat. You're wonderful!"

191
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:38,080
Then, Sci sent a message to his friend Darren, who 
was in India. Darren played games on computers.

192
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,760
Do you know a player called Morbid?

193
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:51,840
Yes. I saw a message from a player 
called Scylla about Morbid. On Saturday.

194
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,320
What did he say?

195
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:05,520
He said: "I'm playing a new game with Morbid." 
Then, there was a message from Morbid the next  

196
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:19,920
day. "Scylla can fly. He flew off his terrace. 
Flying is easy, but the streets are hard."

197
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:28,640
Sci looked on the internet. On Sunday, 
a man fell off a terrace in Los Angeles  

198
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:38,160
and died. His name was Jason Pilser. 
"Was that Scylla?" Sci thought.

199
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,760
Sci met Jack in a coffee shop 
early on Tuesday morning.

200
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:57,200
"Jack, I have some news. Lots of people like 
playing games on the internet. In some of these  

201
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:07,920
games, you kill people, but you're playing - 
it's a game. I think some men in Los Angeles  

202
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:18,640
are playing a game, but they are really killing 
people. Not on the computer, but on the streets."

203
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,080
"Who are these men?" asked Jack.

204
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:38,240
"One man is - was - Jason Pilser. His computer 
name was Scylla. Another man is Morbid. Scylla  

205
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:48,160
died on Sunday night. The police say he fell 
off his terrace. But maybe someone pushed him."

206
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,840
"Let's go to his apartment," said Jack.

207
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:06,480
Jack and Sci met Nora at the apartment building, 
and they went up together. There wasn't anything  

208
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:14,080
interesting in the living room. But in the 
bedroom were a laptop and a cell phone.

209
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:23,280
"I'll take the computer back to Mo-bot," 
said Sci. "But I'll look at the phone now."  

210
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,440
He started to read the text messages.

211
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:34,720
"Jack, look at this." Sci gave the phone to Jack.

212
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:43,120
It's tonight, Scylla. You're 
the killer. Steemcleena

213
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:53,840
"It's from Steemcleena!" said Jack. 
"He's working in a group!"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

214
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,520
CHAPTER EIGHT

215
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,960
They're going to kill again

216
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:09,760
Justine took the police photos of Wendy 
Borman's body to the office at Private. She also  

217
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:19,360
took a bag of Wendy's clothes. "Sci can look at 
those," she thought. "There may be DNA on them!"

218
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,960
Justine looked at the photos of 
Wendy, dead, behind the restaurant.  

219
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:36,560
Five years ago, the police found Wendy's bag 
next to her, but her necklace was not there.  

220
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:47,120
Wendy always wore the necklace, and Justine 
found a photo of it. It had a star on it.

221
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,840
Then, she went to find 
Christine Castiglia in school.

222
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:04,720
Justine found Christine in the school restaurant. 
"Do you remember Wendy Borman?" she asked.

223
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,680
"I was only eleven," said Christine.

224
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:18,560
"Yes, but can you remember anything? 
What did you see?" asked Justine.

225
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,160
"A van stopped, and two boys got 
out and pushed a girl into the back.  

226
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,440
Then, they drove away. It was 
very quick," said Christine.

227
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,640
"And you saw the driver?" said Justine.

228
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,840
"He had a long nose. And 
big ears," said Christine.

229
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,240
"And the van?" said Justine.

230
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:59,840
"It was black. I remember a word 
on it: Gateway," said Christine.

231
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:08,880
Gateway. This was new. Gateway was 
an expensive school in Santa Monica.

232
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,840
"Thank you, Christine," said Justine.

233
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,160
Sci worked for hours on Wendy Borman's clothes.  

234
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:31,200
He looked for DNA and he found it - 
from two different men. "Yes!" he said.

235
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,680
He heard someone at the door, 
and Mo-bot ran into his office.  

236
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:46,720
"Sci, they are going to kill again. 
This week! I looked at Jason's computer.  

237
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:55,840
There were thousands of messages, and 
I read them all. Look at this one!"

238
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,640
Morbid, Scylla. Here's the next woman.  

239
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:09,840
She lives in Silver Lake, and her 
name is Graciella. Steemcleena

240
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,280
There was a photo of a young woman. 
"I'll call Jack," said Sci.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

241
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,840
CHAPTER NINE

242
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,800
Help from Carmine Noccia

243
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,840
On Tuesday afternoon, Jack 
was in his office with Emilio.  

244
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,440
They knew something about the young women's 
killers now, but nothing about Shelby's.

245
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:48,400
"Andy isn't a killer," Jack said. 
"Shelby's killer was a professional.  

246
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:59,520
There was no DNA, no gun, nothing. We need 
to talk to Carmine Noccia in Las Vegas."

247
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:09,200
Carmine and his family knew every professional 
killer from California to Florida.  

248
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:20,720
Jack didn't often work with men like Carmine. 
But, once, Carmine asked for Private's help -  

249
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:30,560
his daughter ran away, and he wanted her back. 
Jack found her. Carmine never forgot a friend.

250
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,760
"We'll fly to Las Vegas," Jack said.

251
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:45,120
Carmine was very rich, and his home was 
in a park, half an hour from the airport.  

252
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:53,360
Two big men came to meet Jack and Emilio 
at the door and took their guns from them.

253
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,920
Carmine was in the sitting room.

254
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,200
"Good to see you, Jack," said Carmine.

255
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,360
"I need your help," said Jack.

256
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:19,120
"Jack, you helped me, and I'll help 
you. But don't ask again," said Carmine.

257
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,680
"Someone killed my friend Shelby 
Cushman in Los Angeles - a professional.  

258
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,280
Who was the killer, do you know?" said Jack.

259
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:43,840
"I don't know. But I can ask. I'll 
call you when I know," said Carmine.

260
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:54,880
The call from Carmine came late at night. 
He only said two words: "Bo Montgomery."

261
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:05,040
Jack called Emilio early Wednesday 
morning. Emilio said he knew Bo Montgomery.  

262
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,880
Bo was a professional killer, and he 
lived on a horse farm in the Agoura Hills.

263
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,720
Jack and Emilio drove there fast. 
They stopped near the farmhouse.

264
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:33,920
A door opened slowly, and a man came out. He 
had a big dog, and in his arms was an AK-47.  

265
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,920
"What do you want?" he asked.

266
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:46,080
"I'm Jack Morgan, from Private. 
I'm working for Andy Cushman.  

267
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:54,160
Someone killed his wife, 
Shelby. Who paid for that?"

268
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,360
Bo Montgomery thought for a 
minute and then spoke slowly.  

269
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:08,960
"I don't know Shelby Cushman. I 
don't know any women in Bluffs."

270
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:19,200
Then, he wrote a name on the ground with 
the end of his gun. Jack looked at the name,  

271
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,240
and then Bo kicked it away.

272
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:35,840
"Goodbye, Mr Morgan," he said. "And please, drive 
slowly. The horses get frightened."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

273
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,160
CHAPTER TEN

274
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,840
DNA

275
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:49,840
Christine Castiglia wanted to meet 
Justine again, on Wednesday after school.

276
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,480
"Let's go to the coffee shop on Melrose Avenue,"  

277
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,440
said Christine. "I'll remember better 
there about the boys and the van."

278
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,040
"Great," said Justine.

279
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,640
The coffee shop was the same as five years before.  

280
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:19,280
"My mum and I sat here," said Christine. 
She went to a table near the window.

281
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:28,240
Justine had yearbooks for three years from 
Gateway school with photos of all the students.  

282
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,800
She put them on the table. "Can you look 
at these? Maybe one of the boys is there."

283
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:46,480
Christine turned the pages of the yearbooks. 
She stopped and looked at a photo of a group  

284
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:57,600
of boys. "That's him!" she said. She showed 
Justine. The boy had a long nose and big ears.

285
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,040
Justine looked at the name under 
the photo. Rudolph Crocker.

286
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,440
"Great job, Christine!" she said.

287
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:20,560
She opened her laptop and looked for Rudolph 
Crocker. There were two in Los Angeles. The first  

288
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:28,880
was sixty-six years old. The second worked 
for a small company on Wilshire Boulevard.  

289
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,080
And there was a photo of him. It 
was the boy, five years older.

290
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,840
Now, Justine needed his DNA.

291
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,640
Justine went to see Nora 
Cronin at the police station.  

292
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:55,840
"We have DNA from Wendy Borman's clothes," 
she told her. "It's from two men,  

293
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:07,120
but we don't know them. But I talked to Christine 
Castiglia. We looked at some photos, and she saw  

294
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:18,240
this boy. He pushed Wendy Borman into the van. 
Look!" She showed Nora a photo on her computer.  

295
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:27,840
"His name is Rudolph Crocker. He's twenty-three 
now, and he lives and works in Los Angeles."

296
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,240
"Maybe this is Steemcleena. And 
you want his DNA?" said Nora.

297
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,680
"Yes. Can you help me?" said Justine.

298
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:52,480
Nora and Justine stopped their car near Crocker's 
apartment building. They watched and waited.  

299
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:04,880
Crocker left the apartment at 6 p.m. and went for 
a run. He came home, and at 8 p.m. he came out  

300
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:14,400
and got into a new, dark blue Toyota van. He 
drove to a bar called Whiskey Blue and went in.

301
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,840
The two women went into the bar after him.

302
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,040
There were a lot of people in the 
bar. Crocker was in the corner with  

303
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,840
a man with long hair. Justine bought 
drinks, and the two women watched.

304
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:42,800
Half an hour later, the men finished 
their drinks and left. Nora and Justine  

305
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,840
quickly went to the men's 
table and took the glasses.

306
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,000
In the car, Justine called Sci.  

307
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:01,840
"Can you meet us at Private in twenty minutes?" 
she asked. "We have some DNA for you!"

308
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:12,240
Late on Wednesday, Jack and Emilio drove 
back to the city from the Agoura Hills.  

309
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,760
Jack left Emilio at his apartment 
and went to see Andy Cushman.

310
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:30,560
"Jack, why are you here now? It's 
1 a.m. You look tired!" said Andy.

311
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,720
"I am tired," said Jack. "Today, 
I drove to the Agoura Hills.  

312
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:45,360
How much did you pay Bo 
Montgomery to kill Shelby?"

313
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:53,120
Andy started to cry. "You don't understand, Jack,"  

314
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:04,000
he said. "She was with another man, that 
movie star. I couldn't live with that!"

315
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:13,680
Jack didn't speak. He hit Andy in the 
face, three times, and left.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

316
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,320
CHAPTER ELEVEN

317
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,800
A dark blue van

318
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:29,040
The next morning, Sci had news for 
Justine and Nora about the DNA.

319
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,840
"I have DNA from one of the glasses," 
he said. "Not Crocker's glass,  

320
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:45,680
the other man's. It's the same as 
the DNA on Wendy Borman's clothes."

321
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:56,000
"Who is this other man?" asked Justine. 
"We don't know him. Is it Morbid?"

322
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:03,440
"Maybe. And what did you get from 
Crocker's glass?" Nora asked Sci.

323
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:12,240
"I couldn't get DNA from Crocker's 
glass. It was too dirty," said Sci.

324
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:23,520
Justine looked at Nora. "What now?" she 
asked. "We must find Crocker!" said Nora.

325
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:36,080
Mo-bot worked all morning on her computer, 
and then she found something. She called Jack.

326
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:43,680
"Morbid wants to kill Graciella tonight! 
He's sending her text messages from a friend,  

327
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:54,240
Lulu. Graciella is answering these messages 
from Lulu. She says, 'See you after school',  

328
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,400
but I don't know where they are meeting."

329
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,320
"Where is Morbid?" asked Jack.

330
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,360
"I don't know," said Mo-bot.

331
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:16,000
Justine and Nora drove to Crocker's 
office on Wilshire Boulevard.

332
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,960
"Mr. Crocker is on vacation 
today," said the woman at the desk.

333
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,880
They drove fast to his 
apartment, but he wasn't there.

334
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,520
"Let's find his van!" said Nora.

335
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,360
Nora called the police station.  

336
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:47,280
"We're looking for a new, dark blue Toyota 
van. Every police car must look for it."

337
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,720
Then, she and Justine waited in their 
car near Crocker's apartment building.

338
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:03,440
The call came back to Nora. "The 
dark blue van is in Silver Lake.  

339
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,880
It was on Alvarado Street, 
but we can't find it now."

340
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:18,560
"We must stop that van!" shouted Nora 
into the radio. "The driver is a killer!"

341
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,760
Jack and Emilio were on the 
road, too. Mo-bot called Jack.

342
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,280
"I'm reading more messages 
from Morbid to Graciella,"  

343
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,280
she told him. "She's in Glendale, and he 
wants to meet at Ralph's Supermarket."

344
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:47,760
Graciella was in the street near the 
supermarket. Morbid walked up to her.

345
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:56,400
"Graciella?" he said. "I'm a friend 
of Lulu's. She's in hospital.  

346
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,560
Can you come with me to visit 
her? She wants to see you."

347
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:13,680
Morbid put his hand on Graciella's arm. Jack ran 
across the street and hit him in the stomach.

348
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:23,840
Morbid fell down, and Jack held him. 
"Where's Rudolph Crocker?" shouted Jack.

349
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:33,440
Nora and Justine got to Glendale quickly, 
too. Crocker's van was behind the supermarket,  

350
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,440
with a police car next to it. 
Nora talked to a police officer.

351
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,800
"Crocker is in the van, Lieutenant," 
he said. "He won't open the doors."

352
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:57,360
Justine walked up to the van. Crocker was sitting 
with his hands on his head. "Get out of the van,  

353
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,840
Crocker," she said. He smiled at her.

354
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:12,240
Justine hit the van window hard with her gun. 
She put her hand into the van, opened the door,  

355
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:19,840
and pulled Crocker out. There 
was blood and glass everywhere.

356
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,400
At the supermarket, the police took Morbid away.  

357
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:34,640
Jack and Emilio walked to Crocker's van. They 
found Justine with her foot on Crocker's back.

358
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,360
"Are you OK?" asked Jack. 
"There's a lot of blood on you."

359
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,080
"It's not mine," said Justine. "It's Crocker's."

360
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,520
Jack put some glass with blood on it in a bag  

361
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:01,840
and gave it to Emilio. "Get this to 
Sci," he said. "There's DNA here."

362
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,440
The police took Crocker away.  

363
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:15,840
Justine looked at Nora. "We need to go to his 
apartment and look for Wendy Borman's necklace."

364
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:26,160
Justine and Nora looked everywhere in Crocker's 
apartment. They found nothing. Justine opened  

365
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:35,120
the closet in the bedroom to look at Crocker's 
clothes again. The light was on a string, and she  

366
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:45,360
pulled it. She looked at the end of the string in 
her hand. It was the star from Wendy's necklace.

367
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:56,640
"We've caught them, Justine," said Jack, 
back at Private. "Sci looked at the DNA  

368
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:02,720
from Crocker's blood. It's the same 
as the DNA from Wendy's clothes."

369
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,880
The next morning, Jack's phone woke him early.  

370
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:21,520
"Jack, it's Carmine Noccia. I have some bad 
news for you. Your friend Andy Cushman is dead.  

371
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,800
His car went off the road near 
Marin, and it went into the ocean."

372
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,840
"Did anybody see Andy's car 
go into the ocean?" said Jack.

373
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:49,520
"Oh, yes. One of my cousins saw it. He was the 
only person there. Have a good day," said Carmine.

374
00:50:51,360 --> 00:51:00,720
Jack looked at his phone for a minute and 
thought, "Carmine's cousin killed Andy." Then,  

375
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:13,440
he turned and threw it out of the window. It was 
time for a new phone and a new phone number.
 
 
 
 

376
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,147
- THE END -
