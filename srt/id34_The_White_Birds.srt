1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,569
The White Birds

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:09,040
Once there was a king with ten sons and one
daughter.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,389
Their mother died when the daughter, Elisa,
was born.

4
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,369
They were very good, happy children.

5
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:24,880
Then the king fell in love with another woman
and he married her.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,880
He loved his new queen and in his eyes she
was always right.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,149
But she was a bad, jealous woman.

8
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:40,030
She hated the king's ten sons, and she wanted
to send them away.

9
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,789
Love made the king stupid.

10
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:46,129
It can make everybody stupid.

11
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,160
The poor old king sadly said goodbye to his
sons.

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,420
Then the queen took them outside the city
walls.

13
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:02,909
She said some magic words and changed the
ten boys into ten white birds.

14
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:08,160
'Fly away to another country,' she said.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,870
'Make your homes in treetops.

16
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,450
Find your food on the ground.'

17
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:21,500
And the ten brothers flew high into the sky
and away over mountains and rivers.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:30,530
They came to a great sea and they made their
home in some trees next to it.

19
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,450
When Elisa learned about her brothers, she
ran away from the king's house.

20
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,700
She cried for hours.

21
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,380
She walked for days.

22
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,240
She did not use her eyes - she followed her
love for her brothers.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,280
'One day I will find them,' she thought.

24
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,660
And her love took her near their home by the
great sea.

25
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,320
Night came and Elisa fell asleep under a tree.

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,250
All night the fairies watched her and no dangerous
animal came near her.

27
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,030
The next morning she walked again.

28
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,780
She met an old woman.

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,540
'What are you doing here?

30
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,680
Can't a brother or friend help you?' asked
the old woman.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,150
She gave Elisa some good food.

32
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,460
Elisa told her the story of her brothers.

33
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:36,420
'I am looking for ten fine princes on ten
white horses,' she said.

34
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,690
'Do you know of them?'

35
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,670
'Ten princes?'

36
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,180
said the woman.

37
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,370
'No, but I saw ten white birds this morning.

38
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,460
They had gold feet and jewels for eyes.

39
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,650
Perhaps they were princes.

40
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,790
They were by the river.'

41
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,940
She took Elisa to the river.

42
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,290
Elisa followed the river to the great sea.

43
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,060
She saw ten fine white birds.

44
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,319
Their gold feet and jewel-eyes shone in the
sun.

45
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,560
All round her Elisa saw pretty flowers and
beautiful trees.

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,170
Elisa built a small house from sticks.

47
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,430
She found flowers and put them round the walls.

48
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,380
When she came back, she found bread, eggs
and fish near the door.

49
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,080
That night her brothers came to her.

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,460
She cried.

51
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,730
'Don't be sad,' they said.

52
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,010
'We'll tell you some stories.'

53
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,740
Their stories were funny and after a time
she smiled.

54
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,150
Then she laughed.

55
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,459
When it was late, the brothers flew up into
a tree.

56
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,550
'Sleep well, Elisa,' they said.

57
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,840
'We are watching you.'

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,239
In her sleep, Elisa saw the old woman again.

59
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,790
Now she was a beautiful fairy.

60
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,610
'Do you want to help your brothers?'

61
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,810
she asked.

62
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,269
'Yes!' cried Elisa.

63
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,269
'Of course!'

64
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,269
'Are you strong?'

65
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,269
'Yes!

66
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,469
I am strong.'

67
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:27,729
'Then listen to my words and follow them.

68
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:31,949
There are gold flowers near your little house.

69
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:36,080
Take some home and put them in water from
the river.

70
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,389
Wash them many times and then make them into
coats.

71
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:47,169
Ten coats of gold flowers, one for each brother.

72
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:54,919
'But remember these things: First, only you
can make the coats.

73
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:00,110
Second, you can only speak after you finish
them.

74
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,789
Don't speak before that, or your brothers
will die.

75
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:07,400
Can you do these things?'

76
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:14,190
'Yes,' answered the princess in her sleep,
and she woke up.

77
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,939
She looked outside her door and saw the gold
flowers.

78
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:23,949
She followed the fairy's words and she worked
all day.

79
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,120
When the sun went down, her fingers hurt.

80
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,720
Her brothers came that night, but she did
not speak to them.

81
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,289
'Why are you not speaking?'

82
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:35,710
they asked.

83
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,629
'Is this the work of a bad fairy?'

84
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:41,699
She showed them her work.

85
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,599
She made a picture of ten coats on the ground
with her finger.

86
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,389
Then they understood - her work was for them.

87
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,150
She worked and worked.

88
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,059
Her brothers watched her.

89
00:05:57,059 --> 00:06:01,610
After two or three weeks, six coats were ready.

90
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:07,360
Then one day, when she was by the river, a
dog suddenly appeared.

91
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,039
It jumped at her.

92
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,180
Then other dogs came.

93
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,199
They made a great noise and ran round her.

94
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:21,449
A man came through the trees on a fine white
horse, with many men behind him.

95
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:25,460
Elisa looked at this man and she loved him.

96
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,860
'Who are you?' he asked her.

97
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,509
'Nobody lives here.

98
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,020
Where are you from?'

99
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,830
Elisa could not answer him.

100
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,289
'I am the king of a great country behind those
mountains,' he told her.

101
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:46,569
'I often come here with my dogs and horses.'

102
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,499
He came every day and spoke to Elisa.

103
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:55,120
They walked by the river and he told her about
his life.

104
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,180
He loved her and he wanted her to be his queen.

105
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,869
But why did she not speak?

106
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:05,719
She only spoke to him with her eyes.

107
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:11,160
In the end, he asked her, 'Will you be my
queen?'

108
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,710
Poor Elisa started to cry.

109
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,870
She ran to the gold flowers.

110
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:21,050
'We will take the gold flowers and your work
to my house.

111
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,309
You can work there.

112
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,249
Will you come?'

113
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:28,210
She could not say no, because she loved him.

114
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:35,610
'So Elisa and the king took the flowers and
the coats - there were eight now - to his

115
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,610
country.

116
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:44,740
Her brothers were sad, but each day they flew
high above the king's house.

117
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,879
The king had a jealous younger brother.

118
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,199
He wanted to be king and he wanted his brother
to die.

119
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,520
When the king married, he was angry.

120
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,900
'Now the king will have a son,' he thought,
'and I will never be king.'

121
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,630
The king could not see inside his jealous
brother's head.

122
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:13,470
Because he was good and kind, everybody was
good and kind.

123
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,860
One day the king had to leave the city for
many days.

124
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,719
He had to visit an important king in another
country.

125
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:26,020
The queen stayed at home and worked on her
coats.

126
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,399
Now she had nine.

127
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,020
But she had no more flowers.

128
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,240
She looked everywhere for the gold flowers.

129
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,209
Then she found some flowers in a bad place.

130
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:41,019
The people of the city threw their dead animals
there.

131
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:46,540
'I cannot go there in daylight,' thought the
queen.

132
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,370
'People will see me.

133
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,569
They will not understand and I cannot tell
them.'

134
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:54,050
So she waited for night.

135
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,220
Then she went out and got some flowers.

136
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,470
The king's younger brother saw the queen that
night.

137
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,449
He followed her and watched her.

138
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:10,319
He waited the next night and followed her
again.

139
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:13,560
'Now I have a plan,' he thought.

140
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,430
He followed her for five nights.

141
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:22,029
The next night he called the great men and
women of the city to a place outside the city

142
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,029
walls.

143
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,079
'Why are we meeting in the dark?'

144
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:27,850
they asked.

145
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,639
'You will see,' he answered.

146
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,550
'You will learn something about your queen.

147
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,959
Now, everybody, be quiet.

148
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,540
Wait here with me and watch.

149
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,660
What does our lovely queen do every night
when the king is away?

150
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,399
What do you think?'

151
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,180
A little time later, the queen appeared and
got the flowers.

152
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,120
She started to walk home, but the king's brother
ran after her.

153
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,389
He caught her arm.

154
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,660
'See!' he cried to the people.

155
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,480
'She is a bad woman.

156
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,550
Only a bad woman looks for flowers in this
place at night.

157
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,330
She uses them for bad magic.

158
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,300
She plans to kill our dear king, my brother.

159
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,009
Why do you think she never speaks?

160
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:21,449
Because she can only say magic words!'

161
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:25,750
People shouted, 'Kill her!', 'Put her on a
fire!'

162
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,890
And the king's brother said, 'Let's kill her
before the king comes back.

163
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,520
Or she will kill him!'

164
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,779
He took the queen back to her room.

165
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:43,680
'Tomorrow,' he said to her before he closed
the door, 'you will die!'

166
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,670
The king and his servants were one day's journey
away from the city.

167
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:54,209
They found a place for the night and got off
their horses.

168
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:58,899
The king looked up and saw a white bird in
the sky.

169
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:04,230
The bird flew down to the king and the king's
horse was afraid.

170
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,400
The king shouted at the bird, but it did not
go away.

171
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,920
Then he looked again and saw its gold feet
and jewel-eyes.

172
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,220
'It is one of the fairy birds,' he thought.

173
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,130
'One of the queen's birds.

174
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,050
She can understand their cries but I cannot.

175
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,769
I think it wants me to go back quickly to
the city.'

176
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:30,339
The king called his men.

177
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,930
'We are not staying here tonight,' he told
them.

178
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,670
'We are going to the city now.

179
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,350
We have to go back to the queen.

180
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,170
Get ready quickly.

181
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,890
I am leaving now.

182
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,100
Follow me!'

183
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,519
The king and his men followed the white bird
all night.

184
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,649
The bird called to them, 'Quickly.

185
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,120
Quickly.'

186
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,699
In the city, Elisa worked all night with her
gold flowers.

187
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:08,089
The next morning the people of the city met
in the big square in front of the king's house.

188
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:09,379
They looked up at the sky.

189
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,819
'What are those white birds up there?

190
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:16,720
Why are they making this noise?'

191
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,810
Men brought sticks and built a large fire.

192
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,949
The birds flew down and round the men's heads.

193
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:27,290
They took some sticks and flew away.

194
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,269
But they could not take every stick.

195
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:33,510
The king's brother went to the queen's room.

196
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,810
He brought her outside and into the square.

197
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:42,949
She carried the gold coats in her arms, and
the birds flew with her.

198
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:48,149
At the same time the king arrived at the opposite
end of the square.

199
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:50,940
His white bird flew over the people's heads.

200
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,540
'It is the queen,' cried the king.

201
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,759
He fought his way through the people to the
middle of the square.

202
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:01,500
'A fire?' cried the king.

203
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,579
'Why are you building a fire?'

204
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:08,440
He looked at his younger brother and he knew!

205
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,850
He was very angry, and the people were sorry.

206
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:19,860
The younger brother turned to the people and
shouted, 'Do we want her to die?'

207
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,959
But the people did not answer 'yes'.

208
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,410
They looked at their feet.

209
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,110
Then a little boy at the front shouted, 'No.'

210
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,029
And everybody shouted, 'No!'

211
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:38,730
The queen called to the white birds, 'Come
here, my brothers.'

212
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,100
The birds flew down to her feet.

213
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:49,730
She threw her wonderful gold coats over them
and they changed into ten fine young princes.

214
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:56,500
The princes took the king's brother on top
of the city walls and threw him to the ground.

215
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,129
Boys ran after them and threw stones at him.

216
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:04,319
Nobody saw him again.

217
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:08,339
The king put his arms round his queen.

218
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:13,240
Speak to me now, my beautiful wife.'

219
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,149
When you see white birds above you, listen.

220
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:20,249
You will hear them cry, 'Quickly.

221
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:21,490
Quickly'.

222
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,500
Now you understand.

223
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:23,819
- THE END -
