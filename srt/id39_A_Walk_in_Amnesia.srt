CHAPTER ONE
A Walk in Amnesia

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,510
That morning my wife and I said our usual
goodbyes.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,570
She left her second cup of tea, and she followed
me to the front door.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,330
She did this every day.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,779
She took from my coat a hair which was not
there, and she told me to be careful.

6
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,830
She always did this.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,670
I closed the door, and she went back to her
tea.

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,900
I am a lawyer and I work very hard.

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,480
My friend, Doctor Volney, told me not to work
so hard.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,030
'You'll be ill,' he said.

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:50,910
'A lot of people who work too hard get very
tired, and suddenly they forget who they are.

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,190
They can't remember anything.

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,800
It's called amnesia.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,460
You need a change and a rest.'

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,370
'But I do rest,' I replied.

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:08,540
'On Thursday nights my wife and I play a game
of cards, and on Sundays she reads me her

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,180
weekly letter from her mother.'

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,970
That morning, when I was walking to work,
I thought about Doctor Volney's words.

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,880
I was feeling very well, and pleased with
life.

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:31,620
When I woke up, I was on a train and feeling
very uncomfortable after a long sleep.

21
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,650
I sat back in my seat and I tried to think.

22
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:44,880
After a long time, I said to myself, 'I must
have a name!'

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,440
I looked in my pockets.

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,620
No letter.

25
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,810
No papers.

26
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,840
Nothing with my name on.

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,390
But I found three thousand dollars.

28
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,890
'I must be someone,' I thought.

29
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,610
The train was crowded with men who were all
very friendly.

30
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,780
One of them came and sat next to me.

31
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,780
'Hi!

32
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,069
My name's R.P.

33
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,959
Bolder - Bolder and Son, from Missouri.

34
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,489
You're going to the meeting in New York, of
course?

35
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,139
What's your name?'

36
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:29,019
I had to reply to him, so I said quickly,
'Edward Pinkhammer from Cornopolis, Kansas.'

37
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:34,620
He was reading a newspaper, but every few
minutes he looked up from it, to talk to me.

38
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,950
I understood from his conversation that he
was a druggist, and he thought that I was

39
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,660
a druggist, too.

40
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,150
'Are all these men druggists?'

41
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,150
I asked.

42
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,170
'Yes, they are,' he answered.

43
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,209
'Like us, they're all going to the yearly
meeting in New York.'

44
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,879
After a time, he held out his newspaper to
me.

45
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,609
'Look at that,' he said.

46
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:06,019
'Here's another of those men who run away
and then say that they have forgotten who

47
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,579
they are.

48
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:13,529
A man gets tired of his business and his family,
and he wants to have a good time.

49
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:19,609
He goes away somewhere and when they find
him, he says that he doesn't know who he is,

50
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:22,669
and that he can't remember anything.'

51
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,269
I took the paper and read this:

52
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,120
Denver, June 12th

53
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,840
Elwyn C. Bellford, an important lawyer in
the town, left home three days ago and has

54
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,169
not come back.

55
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,860
Just before he left, he took out a lot of
money from his bank.

56
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,040
Nobody has seen him since that day.

57
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,290
He is a quiet man who enjoys his work and
is happily married.

58
00:03:52,290 --> 00:04:00,439
But Mr Bellford works very hard, and it is
possible that he has amnesia.

59
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:04,989
'But sometimes people do forget who they are,
Mr Bolder,' I said.

60
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:06,579
'Oh, come on!'

61
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,299
Mr Bolder answered.

62
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,269
'It's not true, you know!

63
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:17,180
These men just want something more exciting
in their lives - another woman, perhaps.

64
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,169
Something different.'

65
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:24,240
We arrived in New York at about ten o'clock
at night.

66
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,960
I took a taxi to a hotel, and I wrote the
name, 'Edward Pinkhammer', in the hotel book.

67
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,430
Suddenly I felt wild and happy - I was free.

68
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,599
A man without a name can do anything.

69
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,390
The young man behind the desk at the hotel
looked at me a little strangely.

70
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,840
I had no suitcase.

71
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,949
'I'm here for the Druggists' Meeting,' I said.

72
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,360
'My suitcase is lost.'

73
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,970
I took out some money and gave it to him.

74
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:06,289
The next day I bought a suitcase and some
clothes and I began to live the life of Edward

75
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:08,479
Pinkhammer.

76
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,290
I didn't try to remember who or what I was.

77
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:21,159
The next few days in Manhattan were wonderful
- the theatres, the gardens, the music, the

78
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:25,840
restaurants, the night life, the beautiful
girls.

79
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,199
And during this time I learned something very
important - if you want to be happy, you must

80
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,970
be free.

81
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:40,060
Sometimes I went to quiet, expensive restaurants
with soft music.

82
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,620
Sometimes I went on the river in boats full
of noisy young men and their girlfriends.

83
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,539
And then there was Broadway, with its theatres
and bright lights.

84
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:57,110
One afternoon I was going back into my hotel
when a fat man came and stood in front of

85
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,110
me.

86
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,900
'Hello, Bellford!' he cried loudly.

87
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,110
'What are you doing in New York?

88
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,930
Is Mrs B. with you?'

89
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,550
'I'm sorry, but you're making a mistake, sir,'
I said coldly.

90
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,139
'My name is Pinkhammer.

91
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,530
Please excuse me.'

92
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:21,870
The man moved away, in surprise, and I walked
over to the desk.

93
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,139
Behind me, the man said something about a
telephone.

94
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:33,090
'Give me my bill,' I said to the man behind
the desk, 'and bring down my suitcase in half

95
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,780
an hour.'

96
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:41,600
That afternoon I moved to a quiet little hotel
on Fifth Avenue.

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,770
One afternoon, in one of my favourite restaurants
on Broadway, I was going to my table when

98
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,069
somebody pulled my arm.

99
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,639
'Mr Bedford,' a sweet voice cried.

100
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,699
I turned quickly and saw a woman who was sitting
alone.

101
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,039
She was about thirty and she had very beautiful
eyes.

102
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:07,439
'How can you walk past me like that?'

103
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,199
she said.

104
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,479
'Didn't you know me?'

105
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:13,530
I sat down at her table.

106
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,719
Her hair was a beautiful red- gold colour.

107
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:20,580
'Are you sure you know me?'

108
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,999
I asked.

109
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,120
'No.'

110
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
She smiled.

111
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,080
'I never really knew you.'

112
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,680
'Well, my name is Edward Pinkhammer,' I said,
'and I'm from Kansas.'

113
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:41,020
'So, you haven't brought Mrs Bellford with
you, then,' she said, and she laughed.

114
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,090
'You haven't changed much in fifteen years,
Elwyn.'

115
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,020
Her wonderful eyes looked carefully at my
face.

116
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,220
'No,' she said quietly, 'you haven't forgotten.

117
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,879
I told you that you could never forget.'

118
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,780
'I'm sorry,' I answered, 'but that's the trouble.

119
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,409
I have forgotten.

120
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:05,580
I've forgotten everything.'

121
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,580
She laughed.

122
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:12,560
'Did you know that I married six months after
you did?

123
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,300
It was in all the newspapers.'

124
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,880
She was silent for a minute.

125
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,199
Then she looked up at me again.

126
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,169
'Tell me one thing, Elwyn,' she said softly.

127
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:31,560
'Since that night fifteen years ago, can you
touch, smell, or look at white roses - and

128
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,170
not think of me?'

129
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:40,470
'I can only say that I don't remember any
of this,' I said carefully.

130
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,760
'I'm very sorry.'

131
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,060
I tried to look away from her.

132
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,060
She smiled and stood up to leave.

133
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,060
Then she held out her hand to me, and I took
it for a second.

134
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:03,710
'Oh yes, you remember,' she said, with a sweet,
unhappy smile.

135
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,510
'Goodbye, Elwyn Bellford.'

136
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:14,020
That night I went to the theatre and when
I returned to my hotel, a quiet man in dark

137
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,150
clothes was waiting for me.

138
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,900
'Mr Pinkhammer,' he said, 'can I speak with
you for a minute?

139
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,290
There's a room here.'

140
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,460
I followed him into a small room.

141
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,580
A man and a woman were there.

142
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:37,680
The woman was still beautiful, but her face
was unhappy and tired.

143
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,470
I liked everything about her.

144
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,350
The man, who was about forty, came to meet
me.

145
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,320
'Bellford,' he said, 'I'm happy to see you
again.

146
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,940
I told you that you were working too hard.

147
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,830
Now you can come home with us.

148
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,960
You'll soon be ad right.'

149
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,260
'My name', I said, 'is Edward Pinkhammer.

150
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,450
I've never seen you before in my life.'

151
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,950
The woman cried out, 'Oh, Elwyn!

152
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,950
Elwyn!

153
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,600
I'm your wife!'

154
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,270
She put her arms around me, but I pushed them
away.

155
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,480
'Oh, Doctor Volney!

156
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,910
What is the matter with him?'

157
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,820
the woman cried.

158
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,540
'Go to your room,' the doctor said to her.

159
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,540
'He'll soon be wed again.'

160
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,280
The woman left, and so did the man in the
dark clothes.

161
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:39,120
The man who was a doctor turned to me and
said quietly, 'Listen.

162
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,040
Your name is not Edward Pinkhammer.'

163
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,430
'I know that,' I replied, 'but a man must
have a name.

164
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,830
Why not Pinkhammer?'

165
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:57,580
'Your name', the doctor said, 'is Elwyn Bellford.

166
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:05,700
You are one of the best lawyers in Denver
- and that woman is your wife.'

167
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,590
'She's a very fine woman,' I said, after a
minute.

168
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,690
'I love the colour of her hair.'

169
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,830
'She's a very good wife,' the doctor replied.

170
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:23,800
'When you left two weeks ago, she was very
unhappy.

171
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,810
Then we had a telephone call from a man who
saw you in a hotel here.'

172
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,740
'I think I remember him,' I said.

173
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,920
'He called me "Bellford".

174
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,480
Excuse me, but who are you?'

175
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,160
'I'm Bobby Volney.

176
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,770
I've been your friend for twenty years, and
your doctor for fifteen years.

177
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,950
Elwyn, try to remember.'

178
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,000
'You say you're a doctor,' I said.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,880
'How can I get better?

180
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,520
Does amnesia go slowly or suddenly?'

181
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,350
'Sometimes slowly.

182
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,540
Sometimes suddenly.'

183
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,860
'Will you help me, Doctor Volney?'

184
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
I asked.

185
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,490
'Old friend,' he said, 'I'll do everything
possible.'

186
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,030
'Very well.

187
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,610
And if you're my doctor, you can't tell anybody
what I say.'

188
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,010
'Of course not,' Doctor Volney answered.

189
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,940
I stood up.

190
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,070
There were some white roses on the table.

191
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:34,960
I went over to the table, picked up the roses
and threw them far out of the window.

192
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,090
Then I sat down again.

193
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:44,610
'I think it will be best, Bobby,' I said,
'to get better suddenly.

194
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm a little tired of it all now.

195
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,220
Go and bring my wife Marian in now.

196
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,980
But, oh, Doctor,' I said with a happy smile.

197
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,519
'Oh, my good old friend - it was wonderful!'

198
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,700
- THE END -
