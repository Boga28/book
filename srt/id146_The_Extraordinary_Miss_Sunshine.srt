00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,380
CHAPTER ONE
A New School

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:08,840
Parents and grandparents say that the years
you spend at school are the best years of

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,240
your life.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,660
Maybe it's true for some young people, but
it wasn't like that for me... not at the beginning

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,530
anyway.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,430
My name is Alice May and I'm eleven years
old.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,689
I lived with my family in London until my
father got a new job in St Ives.

8
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:29,399
We moved to beautiful Cornwall one summer.

9
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,500
This is my story.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,360
The sun shone over St Ives, a seaside town
in Cornwall.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,910
It was a busy fishing port.

12
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,320
There were small stone houses and white sandy
beaches.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,650
Lots of families lived there.

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:52,920
The town needed a bigger, more important school,
so a famous architect designed a secondary

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
school.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,480
The school was for children between the ages
of eleven and eighteen.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,150
It was called The Fairbrother Academy.

18
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,619
The architect was very clever and he also
loved music.

19
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:11,850
'Every school needs a concert hall with a
stage and lights,' he said.

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,240
The concert hall he created was wonderful.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:23,359
He also built a large gym, art studios, computer
rooms and classrooms that were big and bright.

22
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,850
The outside of the school was beautiful.

23
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,780
There was a large front door and lions around
a fountain.

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,750
There were gardens and playgrounds and birds
sang in the trees.

25
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,649
Some of the children who came to The Fairbrother
Academy didn't want to learn.

26
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:45,749
They were not interested in French or Latin,
Maths or History.

27
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:50,850
They pushed their classmates in the playground
and called them bad names.

28
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,369
These children were good when they were at
home with their parents, but terrible when

29
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,380
they came to school.

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:03,270
I can hardly sleep before the first day at
my new school The Fairbrother Academy.

31
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,900
I am excited and nervous all at the same time.

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,500
In the morning, when I walk into my classroom,
I see a group of girls.

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,080
They are talking together.

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,050
They stop speaking when I come in.

35
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,670
'Hello,' I say.

36
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,950
'I'm Alice.'

37
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,500
The girls don't smile.

38
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,450
Their eyes are cold.

39
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,160
One of the girls called Iris Fudge, who has
an angry face, comes close.

40
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,340
She looks at my long dark hair and blue eyes.

41
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,330
Then she makes a scary face and runs back
to her best friend Roxy Miller and the group

42
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,330
of girls.

43
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,420
'Don't go near her.

44
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,630
She bites!'

45
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,810
Iris says.

46
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,000
They won't talk to me because I have braces
on my teeth.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,300
They call me 'Shark Face'.

48
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,850
I don't look very happy when I arrive home
from school.

49
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,330
My parents see my sad face.

50
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,860
'How was school?'

51
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,010
they ask.

52
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,890
'Fine,' I say.

53
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,710
They ask me about friends and I tell them
about the girls in my class and the fun things

54
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,350
we do together.

55
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,410
It isn't true.

56
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,840
I can't tell them what school is really like.

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,630
If dad speaks to the teachers everything will
become worse.

58
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,680
Every day there is trouble in our classroom.

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,190
The bullies don't like children who are clever
and do well at school or children who wear

60
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,190
glasses.

61
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,200
They want kids in their group who are not
very nice to teachers.

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,130
They like children who don't do their homework.

63
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,930
They think only bad children are cool.

64
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,040
It isn't only the group of girls who are bullies.

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,870
There is a boy gang too.

66
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,100
Their leader is Dexter Crane.

67
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,930
He's very tall.

68
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,920
Dexter pushes his classmates when they are
in the playground.

69
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,870
His friends, Ajax McCoy and Blaze Fenton,
watch and laugh.

70
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,650
They stand behind him.

71
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:11,680
At home in our house, a little bird sings
in the tree near my bedroom window.

72
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,290
She sees me crying and I tell her what school
is like.

73
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,820
The little bird shakes her head.

74
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,280
She doesn't like it at all.

75
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:31,070
CHAPTER TWO
Isadora Sunshine

76
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,590
The little bird flies across the fields, to
an old house near the sea.

77
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:43,570
The windows of the house are open and the
little bird flies in and rests on a bookcase.

78
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,690
It is Miss Sunshine's house.

79
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,570
Miss Isadora Sunshine has golden hair and
bright green eyes.

80
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,910
She is standing in front of a canvas, surrounded
by paints and brushes.

81
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,100
She is painting a picture of a storm and sailing
boats.

82
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,570
She has paint on her face and on her clothes,
but the painting is wonderful.

83
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:14,820
When Miss Sunshine sees the little bird fly
in, she puts her brush on the table.

84
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,760
She takes some bread and puts it in a dish.

85
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,840
She brings the bird some water.

86
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,260
'How lovely to see you,' says Miss Sunshine.

87
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,040
She knows from the way the bird jumps from
one foot to the other that she has something

88
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,830
important to tell her.

89
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,070
'Tell me.

90
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,950
What's the matter?'

91
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,480
she says.

92
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,419
Miss Sunshine sits on a chair and the little
bird sings a sad song of trouble.

93
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:44,620
When she finishes Miss Sunshine stands up.

94
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,290
'How sad,' she says.

95
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,120
'You were right to tell me.

96
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,410
We can do something to help.'

97
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:59,820
Miss Sunshine packs a bag with music books,
art brushes and strange musical instruments.

98
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,050
She puts her bag in the car and starts the
engine.

99
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,700
'Hold on tight,' she says to the little bird.

100
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,420
'It will only take forty-five minutes to drive
to the school.'

101
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,060
She drives to St Ives.

102
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,169
Before I continue with the story, I must tell
you about the head teacher at The Fairbrother

103
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:21,169
Academy.

104
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:23,560
How can I describe him?

105
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,650
He is not a handsome man.

106
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,730
His face is a bit like your reflection when
you look in a kettle - sort of squashed.

107
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,340
He is thin, and has long legs.

108
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,240
His name is James Weak and his name describes
his character.

109
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,300
He is weak by name and weak by nature.

110
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,370
Some people say he is a good head teacher.

111
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,120
Others say he doesn't answer his emails.

112
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,980
He is busy in his office every day playing
scrabble on his computer.

113
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:01,030
On this particular day his secretary, Miss
Baxter, knocks on the door.

114
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,400
'There's a lady to see you.'

115
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
'Oh, really?

116
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,889
I wasn't expecting anyone.

117
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:09,949
What lady?' says Mr Weak.

118
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,120
'Miss Isadora Sunshine.'

119
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,260
Mr Weak looks up because the moment he hears
the name 'Sunshine', he begins to feel happy.

120
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,400
'Send her in, Miss Baxter.'

121
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,729
Miss Isadora Sunshine is wearing a yellow
dress and she smells of sweet flowers.

122
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:31,600
She shakes Mr Weak's hand and sits down.

123
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,990
'I am here for the job of music teacher,'
she says.

124
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,970
Mr Weak is confused.

125
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,990
'Um, I don't think there is a job as music
teacher at the school.'

126
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,630
'Yes, there is,' shouts Miss Baxter from her
office.

127
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:54,139
'You have an email this morning from the old
music teacher', she says.

128
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:57,190
She appears with a printed letter.

129
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,180
'He left yesterday.'

130
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,700
Mr Weak looks even more surprised.

131
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,060
'Well, then yes - there is a job at the school.

132
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,930
We are looking for a music teacher.'

133
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:14,850
'I want good behaviour in the classroom,'
says Miss Sunshine.

134
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,410
'Of course,' says Mr Weak.

135
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,850
'But we are a friendly school, Miss Sunshine.

136
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,700
We allow children to call teachers by their
first names.'

137
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,720
Miss Sunshine smiles and shakes her head.

138
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,770
'I'm sorry, Mr Weak, but I won't allow that
in my classroom.

139
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:42,900
Respect is very important and I am here as
their teacher, not as their best friend.'

140
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,610
'I see,' says Mr Weak.

141
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,890
He looks confused.

142
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:53,630
'There may be other candidates,' he says in
a voice weak as water.

143
00:08:53,630 --> 00:09:02,290
'Mr Weak, there are no other candidates and
there is no one better than me.'

144
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,850
Mr Weak looks at Miss Sunshine.

145
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,200
He agrees but he doesn't say anything.

146
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,580
'So,' Miss Sunshine says.

147
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:18,830
'If there are no more questions, I would like
a copy of my timetable, so that I can start

148
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,700
this minute.'

149
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:29,330
CHAPTER THREE
A Classroom of Sunshine

150
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,070
No one talks to me at school.

151
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,370
I feel alone as I stand at the side of the
playground.

152
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:40,050
There are the cool kids and there are the
ones people don't speak to - children who

153
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,510
are different.

154
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:47,060
I want to speak to them, but I'm afraid of
Iris Fudge and her gang.

155
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:53,120
The teachers know there's trouble in our class
but they don't see children push their classmates

156
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,300
or hear the bad names.

157
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,910
The bullies are clever.

158
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,810
Sometimes we speak to a teacher, one who has
an understanding face.

159
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,290
'Write everything down,' the teacher says
to us.

160
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,240
'I will make a report and pass it on to the
head teacher.'

161
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,550
We write a letter but nothing happens.

162
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,860
Things are getting worse.

163
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:22,550
The bullies can contact me in cyberspace at
every moment of the day and night.

164
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,610
Why can't they leave me alone!

165
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,320
And then Miss Sunshine comes into my life.

166
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,959
Children stop talking and texting when she
walks into the music room in her yellow dress.

167
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,070
Her hair is long and golden.

168
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,390
She ties it with a silk scarf.

169
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,000
She smiles at us and looks at every child.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,770
She says, 'Good Morning,' then waits.

171
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,420
We look at each other.

172
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,410
Why is she waiting?

173
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,339
Then we realise and we stand up.

174
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,230
Dexter is the last one to stand up.

175
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,310
He doesn't look happy.

176
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,770
'No phones during my lesson.'

177
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:09,210
Miss Sunshine has a box and envelopes with
our names on.

178
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,300
We don't want to give her our phones.

179
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,279
Dexter and Ajax are angry.

180
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,730
When Miss Sunshine walks past us there is
a lovely perfume.

181
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,860
It's the smell of grass and sweet summer flowers.

182
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,940
She asks us our names and doesn't forget them.

183
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,750
When she gives us our homework we have to
say 'thank you.'

184
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,450
It's our first music lesson and Miss Sunshine
wants us to speak about music.

185
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,149
'What music do you like?'

186
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:42,570
Roxy stands up.

187
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,990
'I hate classical music.'

188
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,630
'Hate is a very strong word, Roxy.

189
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,520
We don't hate anyone or anything.

190
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,019
Why don't you like classical music?'

191
00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:01,330
'There are too many notes,' she says and her
friends laugh.

192
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,750
'I understand your opinion, Roxy.

193
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,070
Classical music is difficult.

194
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,399
There are a lot of notes.'

195
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,060
'I play jazz with my piano teacher,' Roxy
says.

196
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,910
I can feel surprise in the classroom and I
see Miss Sunshine smiling.

197
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,010
'Good,' she says.

198
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,290
'What about rap music?'

199
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,100
Ajax McCoy says.

200
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,209
'Now rap music is clever.'

201
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:31,050
'Why is it clever, Ajax?'

202
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,830
Miss Sunshine asks.

203
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,440
'Rap artists' songs are like poetry.

204
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,990
Each rap song has a message.'

205
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,720
'I like musical theatre,' says Blaze.

206
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,890
'I saw the musical Cats once,' says Ajax.

207
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:49,100
'Any other important musicians?' asks Miss
Sunshine.

208
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,700
Someone says 'The Beatles.'

209
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,840
The class says 'No.'

210
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,390
'You're right,' says Miss Sunshine.

211
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:03,680
'The Beatles were important for all the music
that came after them.'

212
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,710
'What about Ed Sh-Sh-Sheeran,' says Naomi
with a stutter.

213
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,050
She never speaks.

214
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,610
'Excellent, Naomi.

215
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:21,240
Ed Sheeran was really good at music when he
was a small child, like Mozart.

216
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,300
He started singing in his local church at
the age of four.'

217
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,880
Everyone is good in that first lesson.

218
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,550
It's the second lesson when it all begins
to go wrong.

219
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,170
CHAPTER FOUR
Imagine

220
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:45,430
Miss Sunshine's eyes are cold as she stands
in the door of the classroom.

221
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:51,740
A paper aeroplane flies through the air and
lands at her feet.

222
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,860
Dexter pulls a small boy's arm behind his
back.

223
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,810
Two other boys are fighting.

224
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,399
Girls are shouting.

225
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,380
There's so much noise.

226
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,810
Miss Sunshine walks to the teacher's desk,
but the noise doesn't stop.

227
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,370
She takes a whistle from her bag and blows
it.

228
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,280
The sound makes the whole class stop and look
at their teacher.

229
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,029
'Good morning,' Miss Sunshine says.

230
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:21,930
She waits for the class to stand.

231
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,750
Some of the boys sit in their chairs.

232
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,030
They are writing texts on their phones or
listening to music.

233
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,000
Blaze is humming.

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,529
'I see,' says Miss Sunshine.

235
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:38,070
She speaks only to the children who are standing.

236
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,250
'Can you bring your chairs round the piano?'

237
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,880
I take my chair and sit next to Emma.

238
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,089
She's a sweet girl who works hard.

239
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,020
She's clever and they laugh at her because
she wears glasses.

240
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,120
I don't know what Miss Sunshine will do about
the other children.

241
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:03,550
She takes some paper from her bag and gives
a sheet of paper to Dexter, Ajax, Blaze, Roxy

242
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,550
and Iris.

243
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:13,050
'I would like you to write me a few paragraphs
on The Music I Like,' she says.

244
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,279
She walks away.

245
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,100
They don't say anything.

246
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,020
She looks at us and says 'Take a deep breath.'

247
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,610
Someone laughs, but Miss Sunshine closes her
eyes for a moment.

248
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,260
'Stand up.'

249
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,889
We all stand.

250
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:34,279
'Shoulders down, stand tall, straight backs.'

251
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,100
We sing some scales.

252
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,780
Our music lessons are a lot of fun.

253
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,639
Our old teacher didn't let us sing in music
lessons.

254
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,540
There are some things in this world that are
amazing.

255
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,730
I love singing to a real piano.

256
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:56,570
Miss Sunshine plays really well and then she
gives us the music to Imagine by John Lennon.

257
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,330
We don't look at the words.

258
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,480
We know them.

259
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,920
We put the music down and sing from memory.

260
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,910
Miss Sunshine asks if anyone would like to
sing a solo.

261
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,089
The girls whisper 'Emma'.

262
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:16,550
Shy little Emma, who is clever and wears glasses,
has a wonderful voice.

263
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:24,639
And it's strange because now Dexter, Ajax,
Blaze, Roxy and Iris are alone.

264
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,350
They are miserable and we are smiling and
having fun.

265
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:35,459
At the end of the lesson Miss Sunshine collects
the sheets of blank paper.

266
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,540
She tells them to stay behind.

267
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,760
'I want to speak to each of you,' she says.

268
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,470
'But we'll miss the school bus home,' says
Iris.

269
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,550
'My mum will be angry.'

270
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,480
'The driver will return and take you home
later.

271
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,589
I'll phone your parents and explain everything.'

272
00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:00,870
Roxy gives Iris a killer look and they become
even more miserable.

273
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,709
For the first time, I run laughing out of
school with Emma.

274
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:10,429
We are smiling and singing Imagine.

275
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,730
CHAPTER FIVE
Feeling Good

276
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,850
The next morning we go into the music room.

277
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:26,780
I don't know what Miss Sunshine said to Dexter
and the others yesterday, but the mood is

278
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,780
better.

279
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,110
There is more respect.

280
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,460
Roxy and Ajax are sitting quietly.

281
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,960
They aren't sending text messages.

282
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,030
Blaze isn't humming.

283
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:42,169
Dexter isn't rocking on two legs of his chair.

284
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:49,090
I hope we are going to sing round the piano,
but Miss Sunshine takes an unusual object

285
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,240
from her bag.

286
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,200
'This is a singing bowl,' she says.

287
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:01,430
'When I run this wooden stick around the bowl,
it makes a sound like a bell.

288
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,800
This bowl is very old.

289
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,990
Listen carefully until you can't hear the
sound anymore.'

290
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,610
The singing bowl makes a mysterious sound.

291
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,440
It sings in my head.

292
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,510
About a minute passes.

293
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,940
There is complete silence in the classroom.

294
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,390
'What can you hear?'

295
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,820
Miss Sunshine whispers.

296
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,360
'Nothing at all, Miss,' says Emma.

297
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:34,920
'Remember that there is silence in music too
and moments of silence are important in our

298
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,950
lives.

299
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:43,100
Sound and music can help and mindfulness helps
your brain to work better.

300
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,610
Let's make a brain.'

301
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,690
What!

302
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,320
We look at each other.

303
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,970
'Put one hand in the air,' says Miss Sunshine.

304
00:18:52,970 --> 00:19:00,510
'Now put your thumb across and curl your fingers
over the top - this is the brain.'

305
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,640
'Cool,' says Ajax.

306
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,700
'The mind is complex.

307
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,600
It talks.

308
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,280
Sometimes there's a lot of stress in our heads.'

309
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,260
'My brain is always talking to me,' says Ajax.

310
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,970
'That's fine, everyone's brain talks,' says
Miss Sunshine.

311
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,390
'We can help our brain relax when we are kind
to other people.

312
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,260
It makes us feel good.'

313
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,250
'Singing makes me feel good.

314
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,120
Can we sing again, Miss?' asks Ruby.

315
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,840
'Of course we can.

316
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,549
Bring your chairs closer to the piano.'

317
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:42,220
Miss Sunshine gets us to sing some scales.

318
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,610
Miss Sunshine asks Roxy to play the piano.

319
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:52,220
Roxy looks shy at first and says she's too
embarrassed to play in front of everyone.

320
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,780
When Miss Sunshine says that Roxy can play
some jazz, she jumps up.

321
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,390
Roxy has got great rhythm.

322
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,980
She's really good.

323
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,929
I didn't know she had this talent.

324
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:09,850
We sing a song my mum likes, You've got a
Friend by Carole King.

325
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:16,050
I like the words of this song and singing
together makes us feel more united as a class.

326
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,000
Singing and mindfulness are helping.

327
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,280
My brain feels better by the end of class.

328
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,760
I'm less stressed and more relaxed.

329
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,620
When the bell rings, we skip to our next lesson.

330
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,330
CHAPTER SIX
Fire!

331
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:40,450
Dexter and I sit near each other every day
on the bus.

332
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:46,030
We get on and off at the same stop but he
doesn't walk with me.

333
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,980
He walks far behind me.

334
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,970
He kicks stones along the road.

335
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,590
I hurry ahead because I want to get home.

336
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,990
I know where Dexter lives.

337
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:04,070
I pass his house every day, but this afternoon
as I look across his front garden, I stop.

338
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,440
'Dexter,' I shout.

339
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
'Quick.

340
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Hurry!

341
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
There's a fire!'

342
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,340
My voice is high.

343
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,970
I am afraid.

344
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,940
He starts to run.

345
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,600
Together we run towards the smoke and flames.

346
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,180
'Who's in there?'

347
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,180
I say.

348
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,920
'Mum and my little sister.

349
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,460
She's only three.'

350
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,850
I pull my phone out of my pocket and dial
999.

351
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:31,920
I shout 'fire' when they ask me what service
I need.

352
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,330
I try to breathe slowly and calm myself down.

353
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,200
My voice is shaking when I give them the address.

354
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,830
Dexter opens the front door and there's lots
of black smoke.

355
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,740
'I'm going in,' he says.

356
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,740
'Wait!'

357
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,210
I run to an outside tap and hold my scarf
under the water.

358
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,100
I run back and tie the scarf around Dexter's
nose and mouth.

359
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,070
I pull my jacket up over my mouth.

360
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,770
'I'm coming with you.'

361
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,830
He pushes me back.

362
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,200
'No, you're not.

363
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,580
It's too dangerous.

364
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,080
I know where mum and my sister will be.'

365
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,400
Then he goes inside and all I can do is cry
and wait.

366
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,900
One minute, two minutes pass.

367
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,369
It seems longer.

368
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:23,410
The fire brigade arrives, then two ambulances.

369
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,750
Dexter appears through the smoke.

370
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,860
He is carrying his sister.

371
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,720
His hands are burned, but he wants to go back
for his mother.

372
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,280
'Leave it to us,' says a fireman.

373
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,100
Firemen pull Dexter away from the burning
house.

374
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,650
He doesn't want to leave.

375
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:47,220
They lift Dexter and his sister into the ambulance
and put on the emergency blue light.

376
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,160
That scares me.

377
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,650
A fireman appears carrying a woman.

378
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,539
And at that moment there's an explosion.

379
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:57,770
'Move away from here.

380
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,169
It isn't safe.'

381
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,980
A fireman says to me.

382
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,179
I can smell fire on my clothes and in my hair.

383
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:07,770
There's nothing for me to do.

384
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,320
I walk home.

385
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:17,929
Dexter is away from school for ten days and
when he returns he has bandages on his hands.

386
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,080
Everyone is pleased to see him, especially
Miss Sunshine.

387
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,050
'How is your mother and your little sister?'

388
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,620
she asks.

389
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,620
Dexter smiles.

390
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,330
'They're doing well.

391
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,059
The doctors are great.

392
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:33,780
They are still in hospital but they will be
home soon.'

393
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,660
'So, you are living with your grandma.'

394
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,710
Dexter smiles again.

395
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,640
'Yeah, she's lovely.

396
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,610
We'll be there for a while until the builders
repair our house.'

397
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:49,570
'You were very brave, Dexter,' Miss Sunshine
says.

398
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,700
Dexter looks at his shoes.

399
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
'Not really.

400
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,159
I was scared when I went into the house.

401
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:58,960
I couldn't see anything and it was really
hot in there.'

402
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,039
'Do the police know what started the fire?'

403
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,230
Miss Sunshine asks.

404
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,780
'They don't know.'

405
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,360
Dexter looks around the classroom for me.

406
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,460
'Alice was there.

407
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,030
She gave me her scarf to put over my mouth.

408
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,420
It's the smoke that kills.

409
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,840
You saved my life.

410
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,580
Thanks, Alice.'

411
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,110
And our class cheer and I'm crying.

412
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,930
Dexter is looking down and trying not to cry.

413
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,780
'I have something, for both of you.'

414
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,230
Miss Sunshine gives Dexter a large package
and a smaller one to me.

415
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,600
Dexter's is a violin... a really good one.

416
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,289
I can see he's pleased.

417
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:41,270
'It's awesome!' he says.

418
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,920
'I love it.'

419
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,940
'I don't play the violin anymore.

420
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,330
I want you to play it.'

421
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,440
Miss Sunshine turns to the class.

422
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,559
'I don't think you know that Dexter is very
talented.

423
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:59,430
He plays jazz violin very well.'

424
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,820
She looks at Dexter.

425
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,179
'You can't play at the moment.

426
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,130
Will you play for us when your hands are better?'

427
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,320
Dexter smiles.

428
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,520
'Of course.'

429
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,809
In my package there is a ukulele.

430
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:16,929
'For the ukulele band we're starting,' Miss
Sunshine says.

431
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:25,059
'It's easy to learn and I want the band to
play in the school musical.'

432
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,710
'A musical!'

433
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,559
everyone says together.

434
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,150
We all smile.

435
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:39,120
CHAPTER SEVEN
Everyone Has a Talent

436
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,920
My world is different and everything is better.

437
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,700
We all talk about the musical.

438
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,560
We don't walk to classes, we dance along the
corridors.

439
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:56,930
Ajax, who's good with words, is writing the
story and we practice the songs every day.

440
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:02,500
Our voices are better, stronger with Miss
Sunshine teaching us.

441
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,870
Mr Weak hums when he passes the music room.

442
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,380
'Everyone has a talent.

443
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:14,000
You just have to find it,' Miss Sunshine says
during our lesson.

444
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,220
She's right.

445
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,590
There are so many people in our class who
have a special talent.

446
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,110
Iris Fudge is a brilliant dancer.

447
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,909
We didn't know.

448
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:27,570
I love watching her when she's dancing.

449
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:32,659
She becomes someone else, so beautiful and
full of life.

450
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:37,540
She's practising after school every day with
some girls who study ballet.

451
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,510
People who are good at art are painting the
scenery.

452
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,840
And me?

453
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,990
I'm singing in the chorus and learning the
ukulele in my free time.

454
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:53,770
I follow lessons online and I practise in
my bedroom.

455
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,480
Dexter is responsible for the orchestra and
their rehearsals.

456
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,100
He's very musical.

457
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,830
He has a great feel for rhythm.

458
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,131
And he's changed!

459
00:27:03,131 --> 00:27:06,679
He's kind to people and that can make you
feel good.

460
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,200
And the funny thing is that Dexter is different
physically too.

461
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,920
His eyes are not small and hard.

462
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,580
They are soft.

463
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,360
He looks taller, more responsible.

464
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,580
He smiles a lot.

465
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,240
Dexter is someone I can trust.

466
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,419
He's playing the violin again now that his
hands are better.

467
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:28,450
The sound he makes is beautiful.

468
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,309
When he plays I feel happy.

469
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:38,410
We travel home together on the bus and he
talks about the music and performers he loves.

470
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,419
He wants to go to Music College in London
when he finishes school.

471
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,820
'How often do you practise?'

472
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,240
I ask him.

473
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,710
'Every day.

474
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,490
An hour before school and a couple of hours
when I get home.'

475
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,490
'Wow!'

476
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,490
I say.

477
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,309
'If I work really hard, I'll pass the audition.'

478
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:57,500
'And then what?'

479
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
I ask.

480
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,050
'A career in music, I think,' he says.

481
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:05,230
'I can play in an orchestra or form my own
jazz group.

482
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,740
What do you want to do, Alice?'

483
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,919
'I want to be a doctor,' I say in a small
voice.

484
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,170
We sit in silence for a minute and I start
to panic.

485
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,860
I'm expecting him to laugh and return to the
old Dexter.

486
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,700
But he smiles.

487
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,159
'You'll do it, Alice.

488
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,659
It won't be easy and you'll have to work hard,
but I know you'll do it.'

489
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:32,800
And I'm not sure why, but I feel strange.

490
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,260
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Talent Scout

491
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:45,070
There is no bullying anymore and there is
more respect for the teachers.

492
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:50,010
The school magazine is all about the musical
- interviews with the cast and with Ajax.

493
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,930
The story is about people who are different.

494
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,210
We can't all be the same.

495
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,210
The message is to be kind to someone every
day.

496
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,580
Most of all it is about the power of friendship.

497
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:11,420
Tickets are sold out for all five performances
and we are all excited.

498
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,580
I'm playing the ukulele in one song and I'm
singing in the chorus.

499
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,230
The songs make us happy.

500
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,590
We are full of confidence.

501
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,340
School has a greater purpose.

502
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,400
'This is your musical,' Miss Sunshine says.

503
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,930
'Smile and enjoy the evening.'

504
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,110
We are nervous as we wait.

505
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:38,840
It's five minutes before the musical starts
and I look round the curtain at the audience.

506
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,530
The concert hall is full.

507
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,860
Why have all those parents brought video cameras?

508
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,679
The music starts.

509
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,500
This is it.

510
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,700
We step into another world of lights and costumes.

511
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,780
And little shy Emma sings beautifully on stage.

512
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,120
It's a new and exciting experience.

513
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,340
A live performance is very different.

514
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,090
We can hear the audience laugh and clap.

515
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,549
It's great to see their reaction.

516
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:11,390
Their eyes are wide, their faces are smiling,
they are enjoying every moment.

517
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,900
I can see my parents surprise when the chorus
sings.

518
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,240
We are fantastic.

519
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,220
We sing and dance for five nights.

520
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,529
On the first night Mr Weak gives flowers to
Miss Sunshine and the other teachers.

521
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:27,950
We have a party.

522
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,980
We are happy!

523
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,529
One morning Miss Sunshine comes into the music
room.

524
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:36,559
She has something to tell us.

525
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,730
She closes her eyes until there's silence,
then opens them again.

526
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:46,309
'An American talent scout came to one of your
performances.'

527
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:50,030
She can see we don't understand what a talent
scout is.

528
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,230
She tries again.

529
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:57,860
'A talent scout is someone who recognises
great talent and promotes it.'

530
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,789
'Oooooh,' we all say.

531
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:04,700
'His name is Addison Bell.

532
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:09,750
He's a friend of mine and he came to talk
to me at the end of the musical.

533
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,200
He's American, from Los Angeles.

534
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,520
He wants to take your musical to Hollywood
this summer!

535
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
Silence.

536
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,850
Then there are cheers and laughter and crying.

537
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:30,830
'He thinks there's great talent in this show
and he wants American children to hear your

538
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,659
message of friendship,' Miss Sunshine says.

539
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:38,910
The summer holidays arrive and we fly to Hollywood.

540
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:42,440
Limousines pick us up at the airport.

541
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,150
I feel like a celebrity when I walk the red
carpet entrance to the Beverly Hills Hotel.

542
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,150
It's great.

543
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:54,279
There's a pool surrounded by palm trees in
tropical gardens.

544
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,590
Dexter is happy because musicians play jazz
in the restaurant.

545
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:04,330
There isn't much free time, but when we do
have a moment we watch people and Lamborghinis

546
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,890
in the city centre.

547
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,390
Rehearsals are going well and we will perform
in a theatre.

548
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,970
It's our first night tomorrow and we are all
excited.

549
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,860
I don't want this to end.

550
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,340
I don't want to come back down to earth.

551
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,990
But with Miss Sunshine in our lives, what
will happen next?

552
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:29,440
And I suppose you think this is the end of
my story, but not quite.

553
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,970
Music is a powerful force and I love Dexter's
violin playing.

554
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:38,360
We spend a lot of time together.

555
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,659
We watch the sunsets, we laugh and talk.

556
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:47,020
When his hand touches mine and our fingers
meet, we don't let go.

557
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,320
- THE END -
