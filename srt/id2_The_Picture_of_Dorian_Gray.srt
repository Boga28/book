1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:06,890
They must be hidden away somewhere.

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,280
He unlocked a secret cupboard and threw them
in.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,520
He could easily burn them later.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,769
Then he pulled out his watch.

5
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,020
It was twenty minutes to two.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,463
He sat down and began to think.

7
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:20,590
Basil Hallward had left the house at eleven.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,140
No one had seen him come in again.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,740
The servants were in bedâ€¦

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,740
Paris!

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,740
Yes.

12
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,180
It was to Paris that Basil had gone.

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,000
And by the midnight train as he had planned.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,920
It would be months before anyone suspected
anything.

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
Months!

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,850
He could destroy everything long before then.

17
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,300
Suddenly he had a thought.

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,790
He put on his coat and hat and went into the
front room.

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,040
From the window he could see the policeman
passing the house.

20
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,820
He waited, and held his breath.

21
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:00,660
After a few moments he went out of the house,
shutting the door very gently behind him.

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,559
Then he began ringing the bell.

23
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,780
In about five minutes a servant appeared.

24
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,450
He was half dressed and looked very sleepy.

25
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,150
'I am sorry I had to wake you up, Francis,'
he said, stepping in.

26
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,820
'But I have forgotten my key.

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,240
What time is it?'

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,010
'Ten minutes past two, sir,' answered the
man, looking at a clock.

29
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,310
'Ten minutes past two?

30
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,040
How horribly late!

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,080
You must wake me at nine tomorrow.

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,140
I have some work to do.'

33
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,229
'All right, sir.'

34
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,710
'Did anyone call this evening?'

35
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,799
'Mr Hallward, sir.

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,810
He stayed here until eleven, and then he went
away to catch his train.'

37
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,810
'Oh!

38
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,530
I am sorry I didn't see him.

39
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,210
Did he leave any message?'

40
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,210
'No, sir.

41
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,560
He said he would write to you from Paris.'

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,100
'That is all, Francis.

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,200
Don't forget to call me at nine tomorrow.'

44
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,479
'No, sir.'

45
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,189
The man went off to his bedroom.

46
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:19,599
Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the
table and passed into the library.

47
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:28,129
For a quarter of an hour he walked up and
down the room, biting his lip and thinking.

48
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:35,669
Then he took down a book from one of the cupboards,
and began to turn the pages.

49
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,719
'Alan Campbell, 152 Hertford Street, Mayfair.'

50
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,489
Yes, that was the man he wanted.

51
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:42,489
CHAPTER ELEVEN

52
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:44,309
The Problem of the Body

53
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:49,890
At nine o'clock the next morning his servant
came in with a cup of chocolate, and opened

54
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,890
the curtains.

55
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,780
Dorian was sleeping quite peacefully, lying
with one hand under his cheek.

56
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,920
As he opened his eyes a smile passed across
his lips.

57
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,059
He turned round, and began to drink his chocolate.

58
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:05,760
The November sun came into the room, and the
sky was bright.

59
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,829
It was almost like a morning in May.

60
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:14,909
Slowly he remembered what had happened the
night before.

61
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:19,579
The dead man was still sitting there, and
in the sunlight now.

62
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,329
How horrible that was!

63
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,730
Such terrible things were for the darkness,
not the day.

64
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:31,949
After he had drunk his cup of chocolate, he
went over to the table and wrote two letters.

65
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:37,739
One he put in his pocket, and the other he
handed to his servant.

66
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:45,060
'Take this round to 152 Hertford Street, Francis.

67
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:53,499
If Mr Campbell is out of town, get his address.'

68
00:03:53,499 --> 00:04:00,639
When the servant had gone, he lit a cigarette,
and began drawing on a piece of paper.

69
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,689
First he drew flowers, then houses, then human
faces.

70
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:11,559
Suddenly he realized that every face he drew
looked like Basil Hallward.

71
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:20,570
He frowned and went over to lie on the sofa.

72
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,500
An hour went past very slowly.

73
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,860
Every second he kept looking up at the clock.

74
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,289
As the minutes went by he became horribly
worried.

75
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:33,009
He got up and walked around the room.

76
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:34,389
His hands were strangely cold.

77
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,800
At last the door opened, and his servant entered.

78
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,759
'Mr Campbell, sir,' said the man.

79
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,860
The colour came back to his cheeks.

80
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,449
'Ask him to come in at once, Francis.'

81
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:49,949
He felt himself again.

82
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:51,819
His fear had gone away.

83
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:54,819
In a few moments Alan Campbell walked in.

84
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:58,930
He looked very angry and rather worried.

85
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,930
'Alan!

86
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,039
This is kind of you.

87
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,770
I thank you for coming.'

88
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,449
'I hoped never to enter your house again,
Gray.

89
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:18,729
But you said it was a question of life and
death.'

90
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:27,669
His voice was hard and cold, and he kept his
hands in the pockets of his coat.

91
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:32,790
'Yes, it is a question of life and death,
Alan.

92
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,870
And to more than one person.

93
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,889
Sit down.'

94
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:39,860
Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian
sat opposite him.

95
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,860
The two men's eyes met.

96
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,610
In Dorian's there was great sadness.

97
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,539
He knew that what he was going to do was terrible.

98
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:51,990
After a moment of silence, Dorian said very
quietly, 'Alan, in a locked room at the top

99
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,970
of the house, a dead man is sitting at a table.

100
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,599
He has been dead for ten hours now.

101
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:03,949
Don't stir, and don't look at me like that.

102
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,260
You don't need to know who this man is.

103
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,699
You don't need to know how or why he died.

104
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,550
What you have to do is this -'

105
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,550
'Stop, Gray.

106
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,280
I don't want to know anything more.

107
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,669
I don't care if what you tell me is true or
not true.

108
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:25,940
I don't want any part in your life.

109
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,660
Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.

110
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,660
They don't interest me any more.'

111
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,180
'Alan, they will have to interest you.

112
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,180
I am awfully sorry for you, Alan.

113
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,180
But I can't help myself.

114
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,289
You are the one man who can save me.

115
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:37,060
Alan, you are a scientist.

116
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,530
You know about chemistry, and things of that
kind.

117
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:46,590
What you have got to do is to destroy the
thing that is upstairs.'

118
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,400
'You are mad, Dorian.

119
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,600
I will have nothing to do with this.'

120
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,530
'He killed himself, Alan.'

121
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,949
'I am glad of that.

122
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,249
But who made him do it?

123
00:06:58,249 --> 00:06:59,629
You, I suppose.'

124
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:03,779
'Do you still refuse to do this for me?'

125
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:04,990
'Of course I refuse.

126
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,540
You have come to the wrong man.

127
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,770
Go to some of your friends.

128
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,770
Don't come to me.'

129
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,770
'Alan, it was murder.

130
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,770
I killed him.

131
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,229
You don't know what he made me suffer.'

132
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:15,229
'Murder!

133
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,960
Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come
to?

134
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,310
I will have nothing to do with it.'

135
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,699
'You must have something to do with it.

136
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,819
Don't ask any more questions.

137
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,240
I have told you too much already.

138
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,819
But you must do this.

139
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,400
We were friends once, Alan.'

140
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,300
'Don't speak of those days, Dorian.

141
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
They are dead.'

142
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,949
'They will hang me for this, Alan.

143
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:38,460
Don't you understand?

144
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:44,520
They will kill me for what I have done.'

145
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,909
Campbell got up to leave.

146
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:49,449
'I will not have anything to do with this.'

147
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:50,449
'You refuse?'

148
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:51,449
'Yes.'

149
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:53,180
The same look of sadness came into Dorian
Gray's eyes.

150
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,680
Then he took a piece of paper and wrote something
on it.

151
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,379
He read it over and pushed it across the table.

152
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:07,150
Then he got up and went over to the window.

153
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:12,210
Campbell looked at him in surprise and picked
up the paper.

154
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,169
As he read it, his face went white, and he
fell back in his chair.

155
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:19,539
After two or three minutes without speaking,
Dorian came and stood next to him.

156
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:24,780
'I am very sorry for you, Alan,' he said,
putting his hand on his shoulder.

157
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,759
'But there is no other way.

158
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,090
I have a letter written already.

159
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,090
Here it is.

160
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,090
You see the address.

161
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,690
If you don't help me, I will send it.

162
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,430
You know what will happen.

163
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,750
But you are going to help me.

164
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,540
It is impossible for you to refuse now.'

165
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,860
Campbell put his face in his hands.

166
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,709
'The thing is quite simple, Alan.

167
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,050
It has to be done.

168
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,750
Face it, and do it.'

169
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,210
A terrible sound came from Campbell's lips.

170
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,779
'Come, Alan, you must decide now.'

171
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:03,730
Alan paused for a moment.

172
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,860
'Is there a fire in the room upstairs?'

173
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,200
'Yes, there is a gas fire.'

174
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,330
'I must go home and get some... things.'

175
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,250
'No, Alan, you must not leave the house.

176
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:23,459
Write out what you want, and my servant will
get the things for you.'

177
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:29,519
It was nearly two o'clock when the servant
returned with an enormous wooden box filled

178
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,940
with the things Campbell had asked for.

179
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,690
'You can have the rest of the day to yourself,
Francis.'

180
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,110
'Thank you, sir.'

181
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:45,970
When the servant had left, the two men carried
the box up the stairs.

182
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,740
Dorian took out the key and turned it in the
lock.

183
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,690
Then he stopped and Campbell saw that his
eyes were full of tears.

184
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,460
'I don't think I can go in, Alan,' he said.

185
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,210
'I don't need you,' said Campbell coldly.

186
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,300
Dorian half opened the door.

187
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:16,960
As he did so, he saw the face of the portrait
staring in the sunlight.

188
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:23,110
He remembered that the night before he had
forgotten to cover the picture.

189
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:28,250
He was about to rush forward when he saw something
that made him jump back.

190
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:33,670
There was blood on one of the hands in the
portrait.

191
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,020
How horrible it was!

192
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:42,490
He hurried into the room, trying not to look
at the dead man.

193
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:48,560
Picking the curtain off the floor he threw
it over the picture.

194
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:58,470
Then he rushed out of the room and down the
stairs.

195
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:04,420
It was long after seven when Campbell came
back into the library.

196
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:13,050
He was quiet and white in the face, but very
calm.

197
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:19,089
'I have done what you asked me to do,' he
said.

198
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:20,310
'And now goodbye.

199
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,180
Let us never see each other again.'

200
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,220
'You have saved me, Alan.

201
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,610
I cannot forget that,' said Dorian, simply.

202
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,589
When Campbell had left he went upstairs.

203
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,160
There was a horrible smell in the room.

204
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:45,970
But the thing that had been sitting at the
table was gone.

205
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,970
CHAPTER TWELVE

206
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,259
'Why Do You Look so Young?'

207
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:54,959
'Don't tell me that you are going to be good,'
cried Lord Henry.

208
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,880
'You're quite perfect.

209
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,160
Don't change.'

210
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,370
Dorian Gray shook his head.

211
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,329
'No, Harry, I have done too many terrible
things in my life.

212
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:09,600
I am not going to do any more.

213
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,649
But tell me, what is happening here in London?

214
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,899
I have been out of the country for more than
a month.'

215
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:19,970
'People are still discussing poor Basil's
disappearance.'

216
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:25,060
'Are they not bored with that yet?' said Dorian,
pouring out some wine and frowning.

217
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,080
'My dear boy, they have only been talking
about it for six weeks.

218
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,490
The British only need one subject of conversation
every three months.

219
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,480
They have been very lucky recently, though.

220
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,360
First there was the scandal of my wife leaving
me, and then Alan Campbell killed himself.

221
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,759
Now there is the mysterious disappearance
of an artist.

222
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:54,820
The British police are saying that Basil did
take the midnight train on the ninth of November,

223
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:00,079
but the French police are sure that he never
arrived in Paris at all.'

224
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,880
'What do you think has happened to Basil?'

225
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,350
asked Dorian, holding up his wine against
the light.

226
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,269
'I have no idea.

227
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:13,449
If Basil wants to hide himself, it is no business
of mine.

228
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:17,000
If he is dead, I don't want to think about
him.

229
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,630
Death is the only thing that ever frightens
me.

230
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,120
I hate it.'

231
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,720
'Why?' said the younger man, in a tired voice.

232
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,279
'Because,' said Lord Henry, 'it is the only
thing that is final.

233
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:37,509
Let us have our coffee in the music room,
Dorian.

234
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:39,050
You must play Chopin to me.

235
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,550
The man who ran away with my wife played Chopin
beautifully.

236
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,670
Poor Victoria!

237
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,009
I was very fond of her.

238
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:51,899
The house is quite lonely without her.'

239
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:58,310
Dorian said nothing, but went into the next
room and sat at the piano.

240
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,790
After the coffee had been brought in, he stopped
playing.

241
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,569
'Harry,' he said, looking over at Lord Henry.

242
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:06,760
'Do you think Basil was murdered?'

243
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,140
Lord Henry yawned.

244
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,520
'Everyone liked Basil.

245
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,319
Who would want to murder him?

246
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:15,769
He was not clever enough to have enemies.

247
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,370
Of course he was a wonderful painter.

248
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,670
But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet
still be rather boring.

249
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,230
Basil was really rather boring.

250
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:30,899
The only thing that interested me about him
was that he worshipped you.'

251
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,690
'I was very fond of Basil,' said Dorian sadly.

252
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,509
'But don't people say he was murdered?'

253
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,110
'Oh, some newspapers do.

254
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,220
But I don't think it is likely.

255
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:49,319
I know there are awful places in Paris, but
Basil was not the sort of man to go to them.'

256
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:55,530
'What would you say, Harry, if I told you
that I had murdered Basil?'

257
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,630
said the younger man.

258
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,829
He watched him carefully after he had spoken.

259
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:06,550
'No, Dorian, you would not murder anyone.

260
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,220
It is ordinary people who murder.

261
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,889
It is their way of finding the extraordinary
pleasure that art gives us.'

262
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:14,639
'A way of finding the extraordinary pleasure?

263
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,410
Do you think that a man who has murdered could
do it again.

264
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,089
Don't tell me that.'

265
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:22,089
'Oh!

266
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:27,410
Anything becomes a pleasure if you do it too
often,' cried Lord Henry, laughing.

267
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,319
'That is one of the most important secrets
of life.

268
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:35,279
I believe, though, that murder is always a
mistake.

269
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,759
One should never do anything one cannot talk
about after dinner.

270
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,170
But let us pass from poor Basil.

271
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:50,100
I wish I could believe that he has died some
romantic death, but I can't.

272
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,600
He probably fell into the Seine off a bus.

273
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I can see him now lying on his back in the
dirty green water.

274
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,100
During the last ten years he had not been
painting well.'

275
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:20,880
Lord Henry walked across the room and touched
the head of a strange grey bird that he kept

276
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,649
in the music room.

277
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,740
Then he turned to face Dorian.

278
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,050
'Yes,' he continued, taking his handkerchief
out of his pocket, 'his painting seemed to

279
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,700
me to have lost something.

280
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:40,089
When you and he stopped being great friends,
he stopped being a great artist.

281
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:43,810
What was it that separated you?

282
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,040
I suppose he bored you.

283
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,389
If so, he never forgave you.

284
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:56,540
By the way, what happened to that wonderful
portrait he did of you?

285
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:02,800
I don't think I have ever seen it since he
finished it.'

286
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,200
'I told you years ago that it was stolen.'

287
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
'Oh!

288
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
I remember.

289
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,190
You never got it back?

290
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,680
What a shame!

291
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,680
It really was wonderful.

292
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,170
I remember I wanted to buy it.

293
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,160
I wish I had it now.'

294
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,640
'I never really liked it,' said Dorian.

295
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,140
'I am sorry I sat for it.

296
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,250
The memory of the thing is hateful to me.'

297
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,770
'How sad you look!

298
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,290
Don't be so serious.

299
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,190
Play me some music, Dorian.

300
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:41,270
And, as you play, tell me in a low voice why
you still look so young.

301
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:47,050
I am only ten years older than you are, and
I have grey hair and yellow skin.

302
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,910
You are really wonderful, Dorian.'

303
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,910
'Harry, please -'

304
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,380
'You have never looked more charming than
you do tonight.

305
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,190
You remind me of the day I first saw you.

306
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,300
You were very shy, and absolutely extraordinary.

307
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:09,920
You have changed, of course, but not in appearance.

308
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,480
You are still the same.'

309
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,580
'I am not the same, Harry.'

310
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,020
'Yes, you are the same.

311
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,700
I wish I could change places with you, Dorian.

312
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:28,580
The world has cried out against us both, but
it has always worshipped you.

313
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,560
It always will worship you.

314
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,550
Life has been your art.'

315
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:41,790
Dorian got up from the piano, and passed his
hand through his hair.

316
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:55,190
'Yes, life has been beautiful,' he said, quietly,
'but I am not going to have the same life,

317
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,190
Harry.

318
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,690
And you must not say these things to me.

319
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,990
You don't know everything about me.

320
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:10,790
I think that if you did, even you would turn
away from me.

321
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,890
You laugh.

322
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,990
Don't laugh.'

323
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,280
'Why have you stopped playing, Dorian?

324
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,810
Let us go to the club.

325
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:25,410
It has been a charming evening, and we must
end it charmingly.

326
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:30,110
There is someone I want to introduce to you
- young Lord Poole.

327
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:38,560
He has already copied your ties and he very
much wants to meet you.

328
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,440
He is quite charming and he reminds me of
you.'

329
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,240
'I hope not,' said Dorian, with a sad look
in his eyes.

330
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,790
'But I am tired tonight, Harry.

331
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,980
I won't go to the club.

332
00:19:52,980 --> 00:20:01,120
It is nearly eleven, and I want to go to bed
early.'

333
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,560
'Please stay.

334
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,710
You have never played so well as tonight.'

335
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:11,180
'It is because I am going to be good,' he
answered, smiling.

336
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,230
'I am a little changed already.'

337
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:18,810
'You can't change to me, Dorian,' said Lord
Henry.

338
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,750
'You and I will always be friends.

339
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,190
Come round tomorrow.

340
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,840
We shall go to lunch.'

341
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,420
'Do you really want me to come, Harry?'

342
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,420
'Certainly.

343
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,330
The park is quite lovely now.

344
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:43,650
I don't think there have been such flowers
since the year I met you.'

345
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,790
'Very well.

346
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,370
I shall be here at eleven,' said Dorian.

347
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,520
'Good-night, Harry.'

348
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,660
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

349
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,370
'To Kill the Past'

350
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,010
It was a lovely night.

351
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,650
He walked home, with his coat on his arm,
smoking his cigarette.

352
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,630
Two young men in evening dress passed him.

353
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:06,590
He heard one of them whisper to the other,
'That is Dorian Gray'.

354
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:13,830
He remembered how pleased he used to be when
he was stared at, or talked about.

355
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,970
He was tired of hearing his own name now.

356
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:23,490
When he reached home, he found his servant
waiting up for him.

357
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:30,210
He sent him to bed, and threw himself down
on the sofa in the library.

358
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:38,770
He began to think about some of the things
that Lord Henry had said to him.

359
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,930
Was it really true that one could never change?

360
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:47,430
There had been a time when he had been good
and innocent.

361
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,200
He had corrupted himself, and become a terrible
influence on others.

362
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,840
He had even got pleasure from this corruption.

363
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,960
Yet his soul had once been the purest of all.

364
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Was all that gone?

365
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Was there no hope for him?

366
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,480
In one terrible moment of passion, he had
asked to stay young for all time.

367
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,710
All his failure had been because of that.

368
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,960
He had not been punished, but perhaps punishment
was what he had needed.

369
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,620
Punishment cleaned the soul.

370
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:22,840
The mirror that Lord Henry had given to him,
so many years ago now, was standing on the

371
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
table.

372
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,020
He picked it up, remembering that horrible
night when he had first noticed the change

373
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
in the picture.

374
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:39,210
Once, someone who had loved him passionately
had written him a mad letter.

375
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:50,470
It had ended with these words: 'The world
is changed because you are made of gold.'

376
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:56,720
He repeated them to himself and suddenly realized
that he hated his own beauty.

377
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,930
Throwing the mirror on the floor, he broke
the glass into little pieces with his foot.

378
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,070
It was his beauty that had spoiled him.

379
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,830
It was better not to think of the past.

380
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,830
Nothing could change that.

381
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,020
He had to think of his future.

382
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:18,370
Alan Campbell had shot himself one night,
and his terrible secret had died with him.

383
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,800
The interest in Basil Hallward's disappearance
would soon pass away.

384
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,620
He was perfectly safe there.

385
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,250
What worried him was the death of his own
soul.

386
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:34,390
Basil had painted the portrait that had destroyed
his life.

387
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,990
He could not forgive him that.

388
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:45,730
It was the portrait that had done everything.

389
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:50,420
The murder had just been the madness of the
moment.

390
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,180
As for Alan Campbell, he had killed himself.

391
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,500
It was nothing to do with Dorian Gray.

392
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,670
A new life!

393
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,680
That was what he wanted.

394
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,810
That was what he was waiting for.

395
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,280
Perhaps it had begun already.

396
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,460
He would never again spoil innocence.

397
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,980
He would be good.

398
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:22,050
He began to wonder if the portrait in the
locked room had changed.

399
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,780
Was it still as horrible as it had been?

400
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,990
Perhaps if his life became pure, the face
in the portrait would become beautiful again.

401
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,010
He would go and look.

402
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,110
He took the lamp from the table and went upstairs.

403
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:42,410
As he opened the door, a smile of happiness
passed across his young face.

404
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:56,380
Yes, he would be good, and the ugly thing
he had locked away would not frighten him

405
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,860
any more.

406
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,820
He felt happier already.

407
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,850
He went in quietly, locking the door behind
him.

408
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:07,050
Walking straight over to the portrait, he
took off the purple curtain that was covering

409
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,050
it.

410
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,450
An angry cry of pain came from him.

411
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,900
He could see no change.

412
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,410
The thing was still hateful - more hateful,
even, than before.

413
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:21,790
The red mark on the hand seemed brighter and
more like new blood.

414
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:27,940
And why was the red mark larger than it had
been?

415
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,140
It was all over the fingers now.

416
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:36,620
There was blood on the painted feet, and blood
on the hand that had not held the knife.

417
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,620
What did it all mean?

418
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,110
That he should go to the police?

419
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:46,490
That he should tell the whole story, and be
put to death?

420
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,490
He laughed.

421
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,750
He felt the idea was absurd.

422
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,830
If he did tell them now, who would believe
him?

423
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,100
There was nothing left of the murdered man
anywhere.

424
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,970
He had destroyed everything belonging to Basil
Hallward.

425
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,620
He himself had burned the bag and the coat.

426
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,330
They would simply say he was mad.

427
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,760
Was this murder to follow him all his life?

428
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,110
Was he always going to suffer because of his
past?

429
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,360
Yet what could he do?

430
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,280
Go to the police?

431
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,700
Never.

432
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:40,980
There was only one thing they could use against
him and that was the picture itself.

433
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,540
He would destroy it.

434
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:56,630
Why had he kept it so long?

435
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:19,520
Once it had given him pleasure to watch it
changing and growing old.

436
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,880
Recently he had felt no such pleasure.

437
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:33,270
It had kept him awake at night.

438
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:55,340
When he had been away, he had been frightened
that another person would see it.

439
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:12,570
Just the memory of 

440
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,430
it spoiled many moments of happiness.

441
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,520
He would destroy it.

442
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:32,600
He looked around and saw the knife that had
killed Basil Hallward.

443
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:53,640
He had cleaned it many times until there was
no mark left on it.

444
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,610
It was bright, and it shone.

445
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,150
It had killed the painter.

446
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:13,790
Now it would kill the painter's work, and
all that it meant.

447
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:22,990
It would kill the past.

448
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:28,640
When that was dead he would be free.

449
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:44,390
He picked up the knife and pushed it into
the picture.

450
00:29:44,390 --> 00:30:01,290
There was a cry, and a crash.

451
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:21,330
The cry was so horrible that 

452
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:29,160
frightened servants woke and came out of their
rooms.

453
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:38,290
Two gentlemen, who were passing in the Square
below, stopped, and looked up at the great

454
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,290
house.

455
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,070
They hurried on until they met a policeman,
and brought him back.

456
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:50,190
The policeman rang the bell several times,
but there was no answer.

457
00:30:50,190 --> 00:31:02,200
Except for a light in one of the top windows,
the house was all dark.

458
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:15,070
After a time, he went away and stood in the
garden of the next house and watched.

459
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:23,520
'Whose house is that?' asked the older of
the two gentlemen.

460
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,690
'Mr Dorian Gray's, sir,' answered the policeman.

461
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:40,560
They looked at each other as they walked away,
and laughed cruelly.

462
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,380
They knew who Dorian Gray was.

463
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:53,910
Inside the house the servants were talking
in low whispers to each other.

464
00:31:53,910 --> 00:32:01,450
Old Mrs Leaf was crying.

465
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:09,060
Francis was as white as death.

466
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:45,370
After about a quarter of an hour, they went
fearfully upstairs.

467
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:54,360
They knocked, but there was no reply.

468
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,630
They called out.

469
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:08,730
Everything was still.

470
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:54,360
They tried the door.

471
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:23,009
It 

472
00:34:23,009 --> 00:34:24,009
was locked.

473
00:34:24,009 --> 00:34:43,549
Finally, they got on 
the roof and came into the room through the

474
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:44,549
window.

475
00:34:44,549 --> 00:35:00,599
When they entered the room they found a portrait
hanging on the wall.

476
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:46,710
It showed Mr Dorian Gray as they had last
seen him, young and beautiful.

477
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:59,480
Lying on 

478
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:34,809
the floor was a dead man in evening dress.

479
00:36:34,809 --> 00:37:31,539
He 
had a knife in 

480
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:47,829
his heart.

481
00:37:47,829 --> 00:38:01,560
He was old and horribly ugly.

482
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:15,230
It 

483
00:38:15,230 --> 00:44:23,329
was not until they saw his rings that 
they recognized who the man was.

484
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:23,700
- THE END -
