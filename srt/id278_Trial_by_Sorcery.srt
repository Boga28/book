00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,400
CHAPTER ONE

4
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,040
I marveled at the vastness of the Citadel.

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,600
It was home to the Dragon Guard, the greatest warriors of
the kingdom.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,800
While that was impressive alone, it was made even more
amazing because it was also the home of dragons.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,120
The massive, powerful creatures were kept in the lower
chamber of the castle.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,400
At least, that’s what my father used to tell me.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,920
A wall forty feet high surrounded the city of Autumnwick, as
well as the stone fortress that towered behind it.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,280
This was my first time seeing the place, and it was just as
large and imposing as I’d always imagined it to be.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,000
The massive gates that provided entrance through the wall
were manned with guards armed to the teeth.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,240
A small line had formed at the entrance as the guards
checked everyone entering.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,800
I traveled downhill and joined the line, adjusting my sword
belt.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,560
The weight of the blade continuously pulled down on my
pants.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,200
It made me reconsider my decision to use a side sheath
instead of one that went over the shoulder.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,200
It was too late to change my mind now.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:10,320
I’d spent the last of my coins to reach the Citadel, and I doubted the school would allow me to carry a blade during my
training anyway.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
The line shuffled forward slowly.

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,000
I did my best to remain patient, but it was difficult.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,360
I was finally here!

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,880
The home of the Dragon Guard!

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,280
I’d dreamed of joining their ranks for as long as I could
remember.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:28,400
My father’s stories had always been filled with awe and
wonder as he described his dragon and the bond they shared.

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,080
Although it was still early in the day, the sky was clear
and the sun beat down mercilessly.

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,840
I could feel droplets of sweat running down my back and
sides.

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,240
I drank the last of the water in my canteen and continued to
wait.

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,120
After what felt like an eternity of baking in the sun, I was
next for inspection.

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,160
I glanced behind me and saw the line was much longer now.

29
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,520
There were at least a hundred people waiting to get into the
city.

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,360
“Hold it there, low born,” one of the guards said.

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,280
I looked ahead, thinking he was speaking to me.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,000
He wasn’t.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,440
His attention was on a girl in front of me with long black
hair.

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:15,600
They’d already given her sack a thorough check, but the one
talking grabbed her by the elbow and pulled her aside.

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,040
I couldn’t hear what he was saying to her because he’d lowered his voice, but whatever it was, the girl did not
look amused.

36
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,920
“You, stop gawking and get over here.”

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,720
The other guard was glaring at me.

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,360
I hurried forward.

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,480
The guard looked me up and down and frowned.

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,360
“What’s your business?” he asked.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,800
“I’m here to sign up for the school,” I answered, trying to
ignore the sweat sliding down my back.

42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,520
The other guard was still speaking with the girl, and he was
being a little too touchy in my opinion.

43
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,400
“Another low born seeking fame and riches, huh?”

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,880
The guard was wearing a helm, but the ends of his hair
sticking out from under it were blond.

45
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,000
He was a high born, a noble.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,200
They were all the same.

47
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,600
They thought they were better than everyone else simply
because they were born with a different shade of hair color.

48
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:09,160
I’d been bullied in my hometown a few times, not just for my social standing, and I knew in a city this size that it
would be much worse.

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,720
The problem with this guard, however, was that he was only
paying attention to my hair.

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,120
He clearly didn’t notice the insignia that was sewn into my
upper sleeve.

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,320
I didn’t like to flounce it, but sometimes it was fun to
bring a noble down a peg or two.

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,960
“Stop it,” the girl with the other guard shouted.

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,000
He’d pulled her close and was trying to kiss her.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I’d seen enough.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,840
I turned my body so that the guard could see my insignia and
smiled at him.

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,080
His eyes widened for a brief moment, then he collected
himself and waved me through.

57
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,960
“Apologies,” he muttered.

58
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,200
I nodded at him, still smiling, and walked over to where the
other guard was harassing the girl.

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,640
“Is there a problem, cousin?” I asked.

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,000
Both the girl and the guard looked at me.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,520
The girl was confused and the guard looked irritated.

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,241
“I figured you would have been lost in the market by now,” I
said to the girl.

63
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:01,561
I was hoping she would catch on to what I was doing and play
along.

64
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:07,561
She tilted her head ever so slightly as a wordless sign of
thanks and stepped back from the guard.

65
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:12,761
“I’m fine,” she huffed. “This gentleman was just telling me
how to get to the school.”

66
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:18,401
“How kind of you, sir,” I said, showing off my insignia to
him as well.

67
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:21,281
He looked at it, then looked me in the eyes.

68
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,201
He hated that he couldn’t stop me.

69
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,921
I could see the seething anger in his blue eyes.

70
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:28,001
“Would you mind repeating the directions?

71
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,961
My cousin is terrible at remembering things like that.

72
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:32,361
Aren’t you, cousin?”

73
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:34,601
I exchanged glances with the girl.

74
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,361
She shrugged. “What can I say?

75
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:38,601
I’m not used to doing things on my own.”

76
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,081
The guard glowered at me.

77
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:43,921
Through clenched teeth, he said, “Go straight.

78
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:45,161
Through the market.

79
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,801
When you reach the wall, turn right.

80
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,721
The entrance is on the left.”

81
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:56,001
Before I could antagonize him further, he stomped past me
and returned to his post with the other guard.

82
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:58,641
“A bit of a jerk, that one,” I said.

83
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:02,081
The girl was already through the gate, leaving me talking to
myself.

84
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:05,401
I followed her and had to walk twice as fast to catch up.

85
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:06,961
“I’m Eldwin,” I said.

86
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:09,921
“Go away,” the girl replied.

87
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:13,281
“I’m sorry, I thought I just helped you back there.”

88
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:17,761
The girl stopped and turned around, placing her hands on her
hips and giving me a death stare.

89
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:20,041
“Did I ask for your help?”

90
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:20,681
“No …”

91
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:25,801
“Do I look like some sort of helpless wench that needs
rescue?” she demanded.

92
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,361
“Uh, no …”

93
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:31,281
“That’s because I’m not,” she growled. “I can take care of
myself.”

94
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:34,281
“Sorry,” I said lamely, putting my hands up.

95
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:39,241
Her eyes widened slightly at the sight of my right hand. “I
didn’t mean to upset you.

96
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:41,161
I just thought … never mind.

97
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,201
Forget that I said or did anything.”

98
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:46,201
I walked past her and continued following the road.

99
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:51,041
The girl’s response to seeing my mangled hand was the same
as everyone else who saw it.

100
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,681
Horror, disgust, you name it.

101
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:55,281
It came as no surprise to me anymore.

102
00:05:55,281 --> 00:06:01,361
The buildings on either side were short and squat, all of
them built with a dull gray stone.

103
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:07,001
The buildings on the right ended after several feet and
opened into a large space filled with vendors.

104
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:14,121
Multicolored tents were arranged in orderly rows and
delicious scents filled the air, making my mouth water.

105
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:17,041
My stomach growled and I absently patted it.

106
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:23,081
My breakfast had been filling, but I’d walked the last few
miles to Autumnwick and now I was hungry.

107
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:28,201
Considering I didn’t have any money for food, I was hoping
the school would provide meals.

108
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:32,441
My father had never told me about his training days, so I
wasn’t sure what awaited me.

109
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:38,081
All the sights and smells temporarily distracted my mind
from the girl, who I found to be quite pretty.

110
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:43,321
Her attitude, on the other hand, made me question my
judgment.

111
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:51,761
I watched the various vendors as they stood under their tents, hawking their wares and trying to negotiate prices
with potential customers.

112
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:55,801
The sun seemed to grow hotter by the second as I stood
there.

113
00:06:55,801 --> 00:07:01,681
I wiped the back of my hand across my forehead and was about
to continue to the school when the girl walked up to me.

114
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:03,801
“I’m sorry,” she huffed.

115
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:05,721
“Don’t worry about it,” I said.

116
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,961
“No, really.

117
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:09,681
I didn’t mean to be rude.

118
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:15,481
It’s just …” she trailed off and looked down. “My whole
life, people have tried to help me for their own gain.

119
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:19,121
I’ve made it a point in my life to never need help from
anyone.”

120
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:21,881
What she said didn’t make any sense.

121
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:26,401
She was a low born like me, so what would anyone have to
gain by helping her?

122
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,081
I pushed the thought away.

123
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:32,801
“Apology accepted,” I said. “I didn’t mean to offend you or
anything.

124
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:39,441
I thought that guard was being a little forceful for his own
good and thought I could help diffuse the situation.”

125
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:41,001
“Thank you,” she said.

126
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:43,761
She paused a moment, then said, “I’m Maren.”

127
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:44,561
Maren.

128
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:46,761
That was different … but beautiful.

129
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:50,881
“Nice to meet you, Maren,” I said. “Are you really going to
the school?”

130
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:54,601
“I am,” Maren confirmed. “I want to be a Dragon Guard.”

131
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:57,761
“So do I,” I said. “My father was one.”

132
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:58,361
“Was?”

133
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:05,281
“He died,” I answered. “In a big battle ten years ago.”

134
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:07,921
Maren’s eyed widened. “Wait.

135
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,041
Your father was Matthias Baines?”

136
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:16,401
I nodded. “That’s how I got this,” I pointed to the insignia
on my sleeve. “Noble by Deed.”

137
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:25,561
She stared at the patch intently for a moment, then turned toward the market. “Something smells good,” she said. “Want
to help me find what it is?”

138
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:30,041
I wanted to say yes, but because I didn’t have any money, I
was forced to decline.

139
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,841
Thankfully, she didn’t ask for a reason.

140
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:38,401
I wouldn’t have lied to her if she had, but I would have
been embarrassed.

141
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:43,881
My father’s heroics may have earned my family a noble title,
but that title didn’t come with riches.

142
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:46,761
“I’ll see you at the school,” I said.

143
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:50,681
Maren shrugged and disappeared into the crowded marketplace.

144
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:57,121
A droplet of sweat threatened to drip into my eye and I
wiped it away, then continued toward the Citadel.

145
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,401
Girls were odd creatures.

146
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,721
CHAPTER TWO

147
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:05,601
The entrance to the Citadel was much more heavily guarded
than the city gates.

148
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:08,281
And these guards weren’t the city guard, either.

149
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,721
They were Dragon Guards.

150
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:20,801
Their armor was decorated to look like dragon scales, but it
was versatile and practical for battle.

151
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:28,841
Behind the assemblage of guards was a long wooden table that
had weapons scattered haphazardly on its surface.

152
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:36,481
As I drew nearer, there was a whooshing sound that echoed
off the massive walls and made the items on the table
clatter.

153
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:42,361
The guards seemed unperturbed by the noise, but I was trying
to figure out what it was and where it was coming from.

154
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:47,281
Suddenly, a massive blue dragon swooped down from the sky
and landed in the courtyard.

155
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:51,561
I held my breath in awe as I stared at the powerful beast.

156
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:54,961
It was easily thirty feet long from its nose to its tail.

157
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:59,841
The dragon’s rider slid off the beast’s back from the
shoulder and landed on the ground gracefully.

158
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:03,201
I snapped my mouth closed and blinked several times.

159
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:08,441
In all the years my father had been a dragoon, I never had
the chance to see his dragon.

160
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:14,121
Aside from when the guards traveled the kingdom, dragons
were to be kept at the Citadel under lock and key.

161
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:15,841
I didn’t know why, though.

162
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:20,321
Now that I was standing before a dragon, I could hardly
fathom how big it was.

163
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:24,321
Its shoulder was six feet above the ground and its wingspan
was massive.

164
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:29,241
I tried to eyeball the length, but it had to be almost a
hundred feet across.

165
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:32,841
My focus on the dragon was broken as the guards got my
attention.

166
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,841
“Hey there,” one of them called out. “Step forward.”

167
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:41,041
I did as he asked and walked closer, but my gaze remained
locked on the dragon.

168
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:46,001
An older man approached the creature and took its reins,
then led it around the back of the castle.

169
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:51,561
With a swish of its tail, the dragon disappeared behind the
fortress and I looked at the guard who’d spoken.

170
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:56,801
“First time, huh?” he grinned. “I remember my first time
seeing a dragon, too.

171
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:58,801
It’s something you never forget.”

172
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:01,561
“I had no idea they were so large,” I said.

173
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,441
“Yeah, they’re impressive, all right.

174
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:08,041
That one was full-grown, but blues aren’t even the largest
dragons.”

175
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,001
“There are dragons bigger than that one?” I asked.

176
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:15,561
The guard nodded, still grinning. “Anyway, I assume you’re
here to sign up for admission?”

177
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:18,001
“Yes,” I replied.

178
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:19,641
“We’ve got a big crowd this year.

179
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:22,561
We can’t take everyone, but the best of luck to you.”

180
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:23,161
“Thank you.

181
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:26,961
Do I need to check my sword?” I asked, eyeing the table
behind him.

182
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:27,641
“Yes.

183
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:32,881
We’ll take the weapons to the armory and catalog them to the
appropriate students.

184
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:37,161
Once you’re accepted as an apprentice, or rejected, you’ll
get the weapon back.”

185
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:42,401
I hesitantly unstrapped the weapon from around my waist and
offered it to the guard.

186
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,482
He noticed my uneasiness.

187
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:47,042
“Don’t worry, we’ll keep it safe.”

188
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:52,362
“I don’t doubt that,” I said. “It’s just … it was my
father’s.”

189
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:59,402
The guard pulled the blade a few inches from the scabbard and read the inscription on the blade, then looked at me
with interest.

190
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:00,842
“You’re Matthias’s son?”

191
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:03,602
I nodded proudly. “Did you know my father?”

192
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:06,282
“No, but I saw him around here a few times.

193
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:07,722
He’s a hero, you know?”

194
00:12:07,722 --> 00:12:09,162
“I know.”

195
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,162
“I know your surname, but what’s your given name?”

196
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:13,402
“Eldwin,” I said.

197
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:18,162
The guard nodded slowly and set the weapon on the table with
what seemed like reverence.

198
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:24,402
He wrote down my name on a parchment, along with a
description of my blade.

199
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:31,322
I waited expectantly for the guard to say something after he
finished, but he remained silent.

200
00:12:31,322 --> 00:12:33,962
“Do I just go in?” I asked.

201
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:39,282
The guard seemed confused. “Do you not know what to do?” he
asked.

202
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:40,562
I shook my head.

203
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:42,922
“Ah, my apologies.

204
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:51,322
You’ll go through the main doors there,” he pointed an armored hand toward the front of the Citadel. “The
Administrators will sign you in and tell you where your room is.

205
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:57,322
The ceremonies don’t start for a few more hours, but you can
get some food from the dining hall if you’re hungry.

206
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:58,602
Don’t eat too much, though.

207
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:01,322
The stuff they serve at the ceremony is top-notch.”

208
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:06,642
“Thank you,” I said. “It was nice talking to you.”

209
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:13,442
I joined a small group of people who were heading for the Citadel’s entrance and listened to their excited
conversations.

210
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:16,882
Two of them were nobles by birth, both blond-headed.

211
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:22,282
They were talking about their lavish trips to the Citadel
and the disappearance of the princess.

212
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:23,642
That was news to me.

213
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,402
The king’s daughter was missing?

214
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:29,282
I could envision legions of dragon riders scouring the
kingdom for her.

215
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:33,482
Three low borns were talking about all the amazing things
they had seen in the market.

216
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:41,362
That brought Maren to mind again and I glanced over my shoulder to see if she had entered the courtyard yet, but I
didn’t see her.

217
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:45,922
I stayed at the back of the group and kept my mangled right
hand as concealed as I could.

218
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:55,202
A short stairway led to the large oak doors that towered as
tall as four men stacked atop one another.

219
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:59,242
As I stepped inside, an unmistakable calmness draped over
everyone.

220
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:01,682
The excited conversations of my peers died.

221
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:06,242
We all stood in the doorway, staring around the enormous
hall.

222
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:11,122
Marble columns were spaced every ten feet and supported the
domed ceiling above.

223
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:17,322
People dressed in flowing robes were moving in every
direction, their steps quiet but purposeful.

224
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:23,562
I couldn’t tell the difference between their ranks, though I knew there were a few different posts within the school
hierarchy.

225
00:14:23,602 --> 00:14:24,402
“Name?”

226
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:32,162
The question broke the silence and I snapped my gaze to the
right to find a tall, elderly man standing behind a lectern.

227
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,522
Atop the lectern was a book and quill.

228
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:37,442
His robes were brown, plain and unadorned.

229
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:39,522
“Speak up, boy, I can’t hear you.”

230
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:45,242
One of the nobles leaned toward the old man and repeated his
name so loud it echoed off the walls.

231
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:46,842
His name was Simon.

232
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:48,282
I didn’t catch his surname.

233
00:14:48,282 --> 00:14:55,562
The robed man dipped his quill into an inkwell and then wrote the name down, then told Simon what room he would be
staying in.

234
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,842
The process continued through all my peers until I was last.

235
00:14:58,842 --> 00:15:00,882
“Name?” the old man asked.

236
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:02,962
“Eldwin Baines,” I answered.

237
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:10,882
The man peered down at me and smiled. “Yes, I should have
seen the resemblance.

238
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:20,042
My eyes aren’t what they used to be.” He scribbled my name down in his book and then said, “You’ll be staying in the
North Wing, second floor, third room.”

239
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,922
“I’m sorry, but where is that?” I asked.

240
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:34,842
“Don’t worry about that right now,” the man said. “You’ll meet your Curate at the ceremony later and they will show
you to your wing, as well as explain the rules of the school.”

241
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:38,802
I nodded. “The soldier outside said we could get some food
from the dining hall?”

242
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:40,762
“Yes, that’s correct.

243
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:43,082
The dining hall is in the South Wing.”

244
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:47,122
A robed woman was walking past and the old man held up a
hand.

245
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:50,362
The woman paused and the man gestured toward me.

246
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:55,602
“Surrel, would you be a dear and show Eldwin here to the
dining hall?”

247
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:58,202
“Of course, Provost,” Surrel replied.

248
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:00,682
She looked at me and smiled. “Follow me.”

249
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:04,682
I fell into step behind the woman and glanced back at the
elder.

250
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:10,442
A new group had entered the hall and he began taking their
names.

251
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:11,762
He seemed nice.

252
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:14,002
And apparently, he knew my father.

253
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:20,682
Surrel led me down long, quiet hallways and eventually we turned a corner and the sweet smell of freshly baked bread
drifted on the air.

254
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:27,242
“The door to the left is the dining hall,” Surrel said. “You
can stay in there until the ceremony if you want.

255
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:34,602
Although the Provost has assigned you a room, you won’t be allowed to enter it until your Curate has outlined the
school’s rules.”

256
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,922
“Do I have to stay in there?” I asked.

257
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:38,602
“No, of course not.

258
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:40,202
Feel free to wander the academy.

259
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:42,402
The gardens outside are my particular favorite.”

260
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,562
“Thank you for bringing me here,” I said.

261
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:45,762
“You’re welcome.”

262
00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:50,562
With a slight bow of her head, Surrel left back the way we’d
come and I entered the dining hall.

263
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:59,162
Like the market, a swirl of different scents assailed my senses and I knew it would be hard to keep from eating more
than I should with the ceremony later.

264
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:02,842
I joined a line of students and grabbed a tray from one of
the stacks.

265
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:07,282
As we slowly walked forward, a long wooden bar was covered
with various foods.

266
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:14,762
Freshly baked bread, cheese wheels, steaming mutton, baked
turkey … it was more food in one place than I had ever seen.

267
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:19,962
I took a little bit of everything and by the time I reached
the end of the bar, my tray was full.

268
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:25,122
I spotted an empty table and sat down, then glanced around
at the other students.

269
00:17:25,122 --> 00:17:27,642
Everyone was focused on eating or talking.

270
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:30,882
The two nobles I had seen earlier were sitting together.

271
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:40,362
If they were like other nobles I had met, they probably saw themselves as better than everyone else and wouldn’t be
caught dead talking to a low born like me.

272
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:44,402
Disappointed, I cast a final glance around the room and
began eating.

273
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:46,682
The flavors that hit my tongue were delicious.

274
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:54,082
I’d always loved my mother’s cooking, but this school’s food
put her to shame.

275
00:17:54,122 --> 00:18:00,162
The spices from the meats set my tongue aflame, but
thankfully there was a pitcher of water at every table.

276
00:18:00,202 --> 00:18:06,122
I poured myself some and took a long drink, swishing the
cool water around in my mouth to ease the burning.

277
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:10,402
It wasn’t overwhelming, but I had never grown accustomed to
spicy food.

278
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:12,522
I was the oddity of my family.

279
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:19,482
By the time I’d cleared half the tray, I slowly became aware
that the general sound of the dining hall had grown quiet.

280
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:23,162
I looked around and noticed that several students were
looking in my direction.

281
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:27,482
I turned the other way, but I didn’t see anything that would
have drawn their attention.

282
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:28,402
And then it hit me.

283
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:30,922
I was using my mangled hand to eat with.

284
00:18:30,962 --> 00:18:34,162
The other students were staring at me.

285
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:35,082
CHAPTER THREE

286
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:38,122
“A cripple thinks he’ll be able to ride a dragon?”

287
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:44,802
Despite the many times I’d heard similar things hurled in my
direction, the words stung me emotionally.

288
00:18:44,842 --> 00:18:49,282
I swallowed the food in my mouth and took a drink, then
turned to see who said it.

289
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:53,162
One of the nobles, the one named Simon, was smirking at me.

290
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:59,402
I thought about just ignoring him, but for some reason I
couldn’t explain, I decided to confront him.

291
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:01,202
“What was that?” I asked.

292
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:04,882
Simon’s smile grew larger and he popped a grape into his
mouth.

293
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:08,082
“I said, a cripple thinks he’ll be able to ride a dragon.”

294
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:10,722
“Who said I was a cripple?”

295
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:13,522
“Look at your hand, low born.

296
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:15,882
It’s as mangled as a dragon’s toy.

297
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,522
How would you hold the reigns?

298
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:19,522
And what about wielding a blade?

299
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:22,002
How would you fight on the back of a dragon?”

300
00:19:22,002 --> 00:19:26,162
The hall had gone silent as Simon spoke, and all eyes were
on me.

301
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:32,042
“I can wield a blade just fine,” I replied. “And I’ll learn
to hold the reigns.”

302
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:32,522
“Oh?

303
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:37,643
Prove that you can hold a sword,” Simon said. “Challenge me
to a duel.”

304
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:41,403
Just as I was going to respond, a familiar voice spoke.

305
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:43,723
“Such unbecoming speech from a noble.

306
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:51,283
And even worse, from someone who thinks they are worthy of something simply because they were born with a different
shade of hair color.”

307
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:52,443
It was Maren.

308
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:56,603
She stood a few feet away from Simon, arms folded across her
chest.

309
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:59,323
Her black hair spiraled down her shoulders.

310
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:06,083
Though she was a low born like me, she was very imposing at
the moment.

311
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:12,603
Simon was also taken aback momentarily, but he stood up and
glared at her.

312
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:16,163
“How dare you speak to me like that, low born!”

313
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:20,723
“I should say the same to you, considering Eldwin here is a
Noble by Deed.”

314
00:20:20,723 --> 00:20:24,443
Simon looked at me and I flashed the insignia on my shoulder
to him.

315
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:29,643
His face reddened and he opened his mouth to say something
but stormed out of the dining hall instead.

316
00:20:29,643 --> 00:20:31,843
The other noble got up and left as well.

317
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:35,283
Maren came over to my table and sat down.

318
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:39,683
“I could have handled it,” I said. “You know you just made
an enemy, right?”

319
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:43,803
Maren shrugged. “I’ve been surrounded by enemies my entire
life.

320
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:44,963
What’s one more?”

321
00:20:44,963 --> 00:20:49,403
There she went, saying something that didn’t make any sense.

322
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:54,403
As low borns, we were the lowest in society, but we weren’t
surrounded by enemies.

323
00:20:54,443 --> 00:20:56,163
I ignored her comment.

324
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:59,563
My throat had gone dry and I drank some more water.

325
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:01,963
“You hungry?” I asked.

326
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:02,643
“No.

327
00:21:02,643 --> 00:21:03,883
I ate in the market.

328
00:21:03,883 --> 00:21:05,563
I found that delicious smell.

329
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:07,123
It tasted even better.”

330
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:07,923
“What was it?”

331
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:10,083
Maren shrugged. “Some exotic meat.

332
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,363
I’ve never heard of it.

333
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,283
How’s the food here?”

334
00:21:13,283 --> 00:21:17,323
“Delicious,” I replied. “Probably the best food I’ve ever
had.”

335
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:19,963
“You don’t get out much, do you?” Maren laughed.

336
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:21,003
“What do you mean?”

337
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:25,803
“Nothing.” She waved a hand dismissively. “There’s a few
hours before the ceremony.

338
00:21:25,803 --> 00:21:28,123
Any plans?”

339
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:36,883
“No?” I said, then took a bite out of the bread on my tray.

340
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:38,323
It was light and fluffy.

341
00:21:38,443 --> 00:21:38,883
“Good.

342
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,483
You can come with me.”

343
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:42,803
I finished chewing and asked, “Where?”

344
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:48,843
Maren leaned forward and lowered her voice to a whisper. “To
see the dragons.”

345
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:52,043
“What?” My heart fell from my chest into my stomach.

346
00:21:52,043 --> 00:21:54,563
We couldn’t just go wandering into the dragon stables!

347
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,363
Or could we?

348
00:21:55,403 --> 00:22:00,163
I washed the bread down with some water and lowered my
voice. “Are we allowed to see them?

349
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:02,043
We’re not even sworn in yet.”

350
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:05,083
The smile on Maren’s face told me everything I needed to
know.

351
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,403
She was a troublemaker.

352
00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:09,243
I leaned back in my chair and frowned at her.

353
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:11,283
“I don’t want to be kicked out of the school.

354
00:22:11,283 --> 00:22:12,243
I can’t be.”

355
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:18,523
“You won’t get kicked out,” Maren chided. “If anything,
we’ll be forced to clean the dishes or something like that.

356
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:22,443
As you said, we’ve not been sworn in yet.

357
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:28,123
How can they kick us out if we aren’t part of the student
body yet?”

358
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:32,083
I knew it was stupid, but her logic had a ring to it that I
couldn’t deny.

359
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:37,683
I stared at her in silence, wanting to tell her no, planning
to end this insanity immediately.

360
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:41,043
When I spoke, I found myself agreeing to go with her.

361
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:47,923
I pondered how that happened as I followed her down the long
hallways, passing robed students and teachers alike.

362
00:22:48,043 --> 00:22:50,003
“Have you been here before?” I asked.

363
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:54,283
She walked with confidence as if she’d walked these halls a
hundred times.

364
00:22:54,283 --> 00:22:55,043
“No.

365
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:57,163
I’ve seen maps of the school, though.”

366
00:22:57,163 --> 00:22:59,163
Maren had memorized maps of the place?

367
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:00,163
I shook my head.

368
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:01,203
She was lying.

369
00:23:01,203 --> 00:23:07,323
Maybe she was some third- or fourth-year student pretending
to be new and only wanted to get me into trouble?

370
00:23:07,323 --> 00:23:12,243
I was about to turn back when we reached a small wooden door
that was relatively hidden by the shadows.

371
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:18,283
If she hadn’t stopped at it, I would have walked right past
without noticing it.

372
00:23:18,283 --> 00:23:24,963
“Here,” she said softly, but her voice carried along the
hallway. “This is a door used by the servants.

373
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:28,363
It leads outside near the entrance to the stables.”

374
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:31,483
I have to admit, I was afraid.

375
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:40,123
The risk of being caught and kicked out of the Citadel was something I didn’t want to chance, but the idea that dragons
were just outside that door was too tempting.

376
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:41,843
“Let’s go,” I said.

377
00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:45,163
Maren nodded, that blasted smile on her face.

378
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:47,603
She twisted the handle and pushed the door open.

379
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:49,443
A wave of heat washed over me.

380
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:55,163
Although I knew it had only been a short time since I’d
entered the Citadel, it had felt like days had passed.

381
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:59,403
The sun was still high in the sky and it beat down
mercilessly.

382
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:02,683
Maren led the way and I followed closely behind her.

383
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:11,763
About fifty paces to the left was the large opening of a cave that led below ground, a massive burrow beneath the
Citadel that served as the stables.

384
00:24:11,763 --> 00:24:17,563
“There are two guards a few feet inside,” Maren whispered
over her shoulder. “We’ll need to sneak past them.”

385
00:24:17,563 --> 00:24:17,963
Guards?

386
00:24:17,963 --> 00:24:18,963
Oh, great.

387
00:24:19,003 --> 00:24:26,363
My doubt began to gnaw at me again. “Maybe we shouldn’t do this,” I said. “We should wait until it’s officially time
for us to see them.”

388
00:24:26,363 --> 00:24:31,403
Maren turned to look at me. “Are you a chicken?” she asked.
“All I’m hearing is you balking.”

389
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:35,163
Despite my fear, that made me laugh and I snorted.

390
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:37,963
Maren winked at me and turned back around.

391
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:43,563
“They’re playing dice,” she said. “Don’t drag your feet and
we should be able to get by without them noticing.”

392
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:48,163
We slipped into the shade of the cave’s entrance and my eyes
slowly adjusted to the gloom.

393
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:49,723
Maren was right.

394
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:56,643
The two guards were sitting cross-legged on the ground and
they were taking turns dumping dice out of a wooden cup.

395
00:24:56,683 --> 00:25:02,363
As we slinked past the guards and continued lower
underground, the air became cooler.

396
00:25:02,363 --> 00:25:08,803
It was pitch black for fifty feet or so, then everything was
illuminated by torches that lined the walls on either side.

397
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:14,563
Spaced intermittently on either side were smaller caves,
though they were still vast in size.

398
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:19,083
I glanced into one and saw giant eyes glittering in the
darkness.

399
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:25,923
I’m certain my heart skipped a beat and I was distantly
aware of Maren talking, but I couldn’t make out the words.

400
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:31,963
The massive outline of a dragon’s head moved toward me and I
could smell something acrid in the air.

401
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,403
My legs went stiff.

402
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:36,403
I was frozen in place, too afraid to move.

403
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:39,483
The dragon drew nearer and inhaled through its nostrils.

404
00:25:39,483 --> 00:25:45,883
My clothes fluttered from the pull of the air and the dragon
snorted once, then opened its maw.

405
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:47,523
I was going to die.

406
00:25:47,523 --> 00:25:51,923
There was no doubt in my mind as I saw the razor-sharp teeth
of the beast.

407
00:25:51,963 --> 00:26:02,043
Then the dragon made a choking sound and before I could force my legs to move, a foul-smelling mucus flew forth from
the dragon’s mouth and splattered all over me.

408
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,563
Disbelief alone kept me from vomiting.

409
00:26:04,603 --> 00:26:09,683
The dragon backed away and disappeared back into the shadows
of its cave.

410
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:12,803
I turned to look at Maren.

411
00:26:12,923 --> 00:26:15,603
Her eyes were wide, her mouth agape.

412
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:19,163
I thought for sure she was going to start laughing at me,
but she didn’t.

413
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,283
“What is this?” I asked lowly, horrified.

414
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:25,723
“I think it’s dragon phlegm,” Maren replied.

415
00:26:25,763 --> 00:26:27,923
“I’m trying not to freak out,” I said.

416
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:29,563
“At least it’s not acid.

417
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:29,923
Then you’d be dead.”

418
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:29,923
Now she started laughing.

419
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:29,923
I did, too.

420
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:33,923
I had forgotten all about the guards until I heard their boots cracking along the floor as their silhouettes came
into view.

421
00:26:33,923 --> 00:26:36,483
“Come on, this way!” Maren said.

422
00:26:36,483 --> 00:26:39,443
She grabbed my hand and pulled me along behind her.

423
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:47,523
I nearly slipped in the puddle of phlegm on the floor, but
thankfully I kept my balance.

424
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:55,923
We ran further into the cave, going deeper into the darkness
until there were no sputtering torches on the walls.

425
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:59,803
The blackness was absolute, and Maren slowed her pace.

426
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:02,643
She continued to hold my hand as we walked.

427
00:27:02,643 --> 00:27:07,403
I convinced myself it was only because she didn’t want to
lose me in the darkness.

428
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:09,363
“Where are we going?” I whispered.

429
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:11,843
“Away from the guards,” Maren replied.

430
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:14,763
I rolled my eyes. “Yeah, I know that.

431
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:17,323
I mean, where exactly are we going?

432
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:19,403
The exit is behind us.”

433
00:27:19,403 --> 00:27:27,604
“There is always more than one way into a place,” Maren said. “Considering who your father was, I’m surprised you
don’t know more about the school.

434
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,124
Or dragons.”

435
00:27:29,124 --> 00:27:30,284
She was right.

436
00:27:30,324 --> 00:27:36,684
My father had never really talked about the school or the
things he did as a dragoon in detail.

437
00:27:36,684 --> 00:27:43,004
I had always assumed he wanted to keep that part of his life separate from the rest so that he could have some semblance
of normalcy.

438
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:46,884
“Stop,” Maren said. “I think it’s right around here.”

439
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:48,164
“What is?” “I asked.

440
00:27:48,204 --> 00:27:51,604
“The secret door,” Maren said. “I need you to lift me.”

441
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:53,164
“How exactly?”

442
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:58,044
“Just put your hands together so I can use them as a step.”

443
00:27:58,044 --> 00:27:59,164
I bit my lower lip.

444
00:27:59,164 --> 00:28:01,404
She clearly had forgotten about my hand.

445
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:02,524
I cleared my throat.

446
00:28:02,684 --> 00:28:04,084
“Yeah, that’s not going to work.

447
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:07,764
I’ll have to wrap my arms around your waist and lift you
that way.”

448
00:28:07,764 --> 00:28:11,764
“That should work,” Maren replied. “Just don’t get any
ideas.”

449
00:28:11,764 --> 00:28:16,964
I snorted in reply and bent down slightly, then wrapped my
arms around her midsection and lifted her.

450
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:20,204
“Higher,” she said. “I can’t reach the ceiling.”

451
00:28:20,204 --> 00:28:24,164
Maren wasn’t heavy but trying to lift her higher was a
little awkward.

452
00:28:24,164 --> 00:28:28,004
I grunted as I bounced upward and readjusted my arms a
little lower.

453
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:35,524
Her thighs pressed against my head and despite her warning, I couldn’t stop the flow of inappropriate thoughts that spun
around in my mind.

454
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:39,964
She made noises as she stretched to reach the ceiling, which
didn’t help at all.

455
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:43,364
A moment later, there was a brief screeching sound.

456
00:28:43,404 --> 00:28:48,444
Light from above filtered down into the cave around us and
Maren pulled herself up through a manhole.

457
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:52,324
She offered her hand to me and I jumped a few times, but I
couldn’t reach her.

458
00:28:52,324 --> 00:28:56,444
She disappeared for a few seconds, then reappeared and
dropped a rope down.

459
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,404
“Try this,” she said.

460
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,644
I grabbed ahold of the rope and climbed up.

461
00:29:00,644 --> 00:29:03,244
The manhole opened into a plain stone chamber.

462
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:07,844
I laid on the floor beside her, most of the dragon phlegm
still wet against my skin.

463
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:10,004
I frowned in disgust.

464
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:11,924
“Where are we?” I asked.

465
00:29:11,924 --> 00:29:15,444
Maren giggled in response. “The women’s bath chamber.”

466
00:29:15,444 --> 00:29:16,164
CHAPTER FOUR

467
00:29:16,204 --> 00:29:23,564
A few hours later, after I had cleaned the dragon phlegm off
and washed my clothes, I sat in the school’s temple with the other hopefuls.

468
00:29:23,564 --> 00:29:27,724
There were roughly a hundred of us and the building was a
cacophony of voices.

469
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:34,484
Maren had left me alone when we escaped the women’s bathing
room, and thankfully the mens hadn’t been too far away.

470
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:38,084
I was able to get away with at least some shred of my
dignity.

471
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:45,284
To her credit, Maren hadn’t said anything about my dragon encounter other than she’d never heard of anything like that
happening before.

472
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:49,684
Neither had I, but what did either one of us know about
dragons?

473
00:29:49,684 --> 00:29:50,604
Not much.

474
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:54,004
I looked around the room and spotted Maren a few pews over.

475
00:29:54,004 --> 00:29:55,884
The temple’s layout was simple.

476
00:29:55,884 --> 00:30:02,724
Rows of pews on the left and right, divided by a walkway
down the middle, and an upraised dais at the front.

477
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:08,564
Large stained-glass windows behind the dais portrayed a
dragoon riding a massive red dragon.

478
00:30:08,564 --> 00:30:12,684
I knew that dragons had different colors, but I didn’t know
how many there were.

479
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:16,244
I’d seen a blue one earlier, and there was a red one on the
glass.

480
00:30:16,244 --> 00:30:20,004
My thoughts were interrupted when the school’s master called
for attention.

481
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:27,084
I craned my neck to see around the person in front of me and
saw the master was tall and thin.

482
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:29,124
His age was indeterminate to me.

483
00:30:29,124 --> 00:30:36,884
He was at least in his sixties, but I only thought that because his hair was entirely gray, including the short
beard that clothed his chin.

484
00:30:36,884 --> 00:30:43,124
I didn’t think I would be able to hear him from where I was
sitting, but his voice boomed across the entire room.

485
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:44,804
“Good evening, everyone.

486
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,284
Welcome to the Citadel.

487
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:49,044
I am Master Pevus, head of the school.

488
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:52,684
This is our largest group of hopefuls in many years.

489
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,124
Let us hope that this is just the beginning of changing
times.”

490
00:30:56,124 --> 00:31:01,604
Master Pevus shuffled around the platform and looked out at
us, peering in every direction before nodding to himself.

491
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:02,164
That was odd.

492
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:04,404
Was he looking for someone?

493
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:12,044
“As many of you probably already know, we do not accept
every potential student, even if they pass the three tests.

494
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:14,444
The reason for this is not for you to know.

495
00:31:14,444 --> 00:31:21,644
Suffice it to say that there are things here that will remain a mystery, no matter how many years you devote to
your studies.”

496
00:31:21,684 --> 00:31:24,884
He inhaled a deep breath and tightened his grip on his
wooden staff.

497
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:26,884
I tilted my head curiously.

498
00:31:26,964 --> 00:31:28,804
That staff hadn’t been there before.

499
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:29,684
Or had it?

500
00:31:29,684 --> 00:31:34,964
I blinked and looked at the person next to me, but if they
were aware of the same thing, they didn’t show it.

501
00:31:34,964 --> 00:31:36,964
I turned my attention back to Pevus.

502
00:31:37,004 --> 00:31:42,524
“The servants are setting up the feast and we will all move
to the dining hall in the next few moments.

503
00:31:42,564 --> 00:31:47,284
Please wait until they have finished laying everything out
before you start partaking of it.”

504
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:57,364
Master Pevus turned his head and cleared his throat, then continued speaking. “I’ve heard the whispered rumors going
around about the new color of dragon that will be in the bonding ceremony.”

505
00:31:57,364 --> 00:32:00,924
At this, muted conversations sprung to life around me.

506
00:32:00,924 --> 00:32:03,284
Master Pevus raised a hand for silence.

507
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:05,924
“I can confirm those rumors are true.

508
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:13,484
We typically have reds, greens, and blues, but this year we
will see a few black dragons in the mix.

509
00:32:13,484 --> 00:32:21,644
It has been a long time since we’ve had black dragons, so we have brought in a teacher who will aid in your training
should a black dragon choose to bond with you.”

510
00:32:21,644 --> 00:32:29,124
I tried to picture what a black dragon would look like, but considering I’d only seen one dragon, my imagination fell
flat.

511
00:32:29,124 --> 00:32:33,644
He had just named off four colors, though, and that seemed
like a lot to me.

512
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:39,284
Of course, I was completely uneducated about dragons, so I
was probably wrong.

513
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,164
Maybe there were hundreds of different colors.

514
00:32:42,164 --> 00:32:47,644
“Those of you familiar with the Citadel may notice some
recent changes around the grounds.

515
00:32:47,644 --> 00:32:55,164
To alleviate the questions directed to your Curates, just refer yourselves back to my original statement about
mysteries.

516
00:32:55,164 --> 00:33:03,204
If you annoy your Curate with unnecessary questions, you’ll
find yourself cleaning dishes or some other unsavory task.”

517
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:05,284
I made a mental note to remember that.

518
00:33:05,324 --> 00:33:08,164
The last thing I wanted to do was get punished.

519
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:11,924
After all, I had to live up to my father’s respected memory.

520
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:16,964
Master Pevus walked slowly down the center aisle and glanced
up and down the rows of pews.

521
00:33:16,964 --> 00:33:19,924
“I will lead the way to the dining hall.

522
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:22,844
Beginning with the last row, you shall follow behind me.

523
00:33:22,844 --> 00:33:26,844
Once everyone from the row has fallen into line, the next
row will do the same.

524
00:33:26,844 --> 00:33:28,684
Repeat this for every row.”

525
00:33:28,684 --> 00:33:31,564
I turned around to watch Master Pevus lead the way.

526
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:37,124
As he commanded, everyone rose from the pews and got in
line, following him to the dining hall.

527
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:41,924
My row was ahead of Maren’s, so I didn’t get to talk with
her much as we walked.

528
00:33:41,924 --> 00:33:44,364
There were whispered conversations around me.

529
00:33:44,364 --> 00:33:50,644
I eavesdropped on a few of them and learned that people on
the border of Osnen were reporting strange things.

530
00:33:50,644 --> 00:33:58,884
One conversation, between two young girls, revealed that rumors were being spread about the return of the someone
called the False King.

531
00:33:58,924 --> 00:34:02,044
I didn’t know who that was, but I listened intently anyway.

532
00:34:02,044 --> 00:34:04,764
Apparently, everyone thought he had died years ago.

533
00:34:04,764 --> 00:34:06,644
The rest of the conversations were boring.

534
00:34:06,684 --> 00:34:13,444
I was surprised when someone poked me in the back and I
glanced over my shoulder to see it was Maren.

535
00:34:13,524 --> 00:34:14,724
“Where’d you come from?” I asked.

536
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:17,604
“My mother and the authorities are still trying to determine
that.”

537
00:34:17,644 --> 00:34:20,884
She said it with such a straight face that for a second, I
actually believed her.

538
00:34:20,884 --> 00:34:24,884
Maren’s face broke into a smile and she giggled. “I’m
kidding, Eldwin.

539
00:34:24,884 --> 00:34:29,844
Has anyone told you that you’re too gullible?”

540
00:34:29,844 --> 00:34:35,924
“You would be the first, actually,” I replied. “And I’m not
gullible.”

541
00:34:35,924 --> 00:34:38,724
“Right.” Maren offered me an exaggerated wink.

542
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:41,924
We reached the dining hall and my eyes widened as we
entered.

543
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:46,444
The room looked completely different from what it had just a
few hours earlier.

544
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:49,804
The tables had been rearranged and a stage had been erected
in the back corner.

545
00:34:49,844 --> 00:34:53,724
A troop of performers was standing off to the side, talking
among themselves.

546
00:34:53,764 --> 00:34:56,564
Master Pevus stood patiently near the doors.

547
00:34:56,564 --> 00:34:59,444
He waited until everyone had entered before speaking.

548
00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:02,684
“You have all been assigned a Curate based on your housing
assignment.

549
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,484
Each table has been labeled with the wing and floor numbers.

550
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:08,844
Please find your tables and take a seat.”

551
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:14,725
That caused some chaos as a hundred of us tried to navigate
between the maze of tables to find where we belonged.

552
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:20,165
A lot of unintentional pushing occurred, but eventually,
everyone found their tables and sat down.

553
00:35:20,165 --> 00:35:28,165
I looked around at the others at my table and was surprised to find Maren and Simon were assigned to the same Curate I
was.

554
00:35:28,165 --> 00:35:32,845
Obviously, I was happy about the first and disappointed by
the second.

555
00:35:32,845 --> 00:35:42,285
Servants rushed to finish placing food on the tables and once they had cleared the room, Master Pevus tapped his
staff on the floor for attention.

556
00:35:42,285 --> 00:35:46,085
“Before we eat, I’d like to introduce you all to your
leaders.

557
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:48,245
Curates, if you would?”

558
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:54,565
A group of robed men and women entered the dining hall and
separated, each one standing next to a table.

559
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:56,125
Our Curate was a man.

560
00:35:56,165 --> 00:36:00,205
He was middle-aged, with short brown hair and a clean-shaven
face.

561
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:04,245
His eyes were green and he had the whitest teeth I had ever
seen.

562
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:08,285
“Greetings,” he said. “I am Curate Anesko.

563
00:36:08,285 --> 00:36:13,045
Once dinner is finished, I’ll lead you to your rooms and
explain the rules of the school.

564
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:16,565
There aren’t many, but they are important and in place for
good reason.

565
00:36:16,605 --> 00:36:24,245
Enjoy the meal and the ceremony, for tomorrow begins the
most difficult journey you’ve ever experienced.”

566
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:25,965
I exchanged looks with Maren.

567
00:36:25,965 --> 00:36:28,085
She shrugged and began filling her plate.

568
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:33,725
I wasn’t very hungry, so I picked a few delicious looking
items and ate sparingly.

569
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:37,605
I knew I shouldn’t have eaten as much as I did earlier, but
I couldn’t help it.

570
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:40,325
I was parched and drank several cups of water.

571
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:44,005
Before long, I could feel my bladder starting to cry out at
me.

572
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:51,085
I had no idea where I could relieve myself, so I tried to
ignore my body by bouncing my leg beneath the table.

573
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:57,605
While I was looking around the room and trying not to piss
myself, I noticed a red-faced man enter the dining hall.

574
00:36:57,605 --> 00:37:00,445
He seemed flustered and approached Master Pevus.

575
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:04,765
They shared a whispered discussion and Master Pevus’s face
seemed troubled.

576
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:08,045
The messenger left and Master Pevus looked directly at me.

577
00:37:08,085 --> 00:37:09,685
I swallowed hard.

578
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:14,205
Did he know about my earlier transgression with the dragon?

579
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:21,245
That intensified my need to relieve myself, but as the night
continued on, he never said anything to me.

580
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:24,125
Perhaps it was just my wild imagination.

581
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:30,005
The performers entertained us with feats of acrobatics,
juggling, and many other acts.

582
00:37:30,005 --> 00:37:35,445
Eventually, I found myself yawning and the need to empty my
bladder was too strong.

583
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:38,645
I rose from the table and approached Curate Anesko.

584
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:42,205
“Where are the lavatories from here?” I asked.

585
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:44,765
My body was starting to get hot and sweaty.

586
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,805
I was certain he could see my discomfort.

587
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:50,965
Curate Anesko motioned me to follow him and led me out of
the dining hall.

588
00:37:51,045 --> 00:37:54,725
We went to the left and at the end of the hall, turned
right.

589
00:37:54,765 --> 00:37:57,845
The mens bathing room that I had used earlier was on the
right.

590
00:37:57,845 --> 00:38:02,405
I thanked the Curate and quickly relieved myself, breathing
a sigh of relief.

591
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:06,885
“Tell your friend to watch her back,” a quiet voice said.

592
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:10,045
I turned to look, startled, but nobody was there.

593
00:38:10,045 --> 00:38:10,965
CHAPTER FIVE

594
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:15,085
After the ceremony was over, we followed Curate Anesko to
the North Wing.

595
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:19,205
A large staircase led up to the second floor and we all
stood at the bottom.

596
00:38:19,205 --> 00:38:22,765
I’d forgotten which room the Provost had assigned me to.

597
00:38:22,765 --> 00:38:24,645
It seemed everyone else had as well.

598
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:28,565
The Curate ended up having to tell us which rooms to go to.

599
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:39,525
I had assumed that we all had our own rooms, and was sorely disappointed when I realized that it was two students to
every room.

600
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,605
And of course, my roommate was Simon.

601
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:48,285
Before we were allowed to turn in for the night, Anesko
demanded our undivided attention.

602
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:52,205
We lined up single file, facing the Curate.

603
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:59,765
He clasped his hands behind his back and slowly looked down the line of students, pausing a few seconds as he reached
each of us.

604
00:38:59,765 --> 00:39:02,765
“There are a few rules that you need to observe.

605
00:39:02,765 --> 00:39:12,925
It is of the utmost importance that you do not break these
rules, or your time here will be very short.”

606
00:39:12,925 --> 00:39:19,805
Anesko’s gaze lingered on me for some reason, and again I
wondered if Maren and I had been seen by someone earlier.

607
00:39:19,805 --> 00:39:26,285
The Curate continued his speech, his stern gaze looking over
everyone as if we were all criminals.

608
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:31,965
“Firstly, no one is allowed out of their room after curfew,
which is the third bell after dinner.

609
00:39:31,965 --> 00:39:36,845
The bell rings every hour on the hour from dawn until
curfew.

610
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:42,725
If you are caught gallivanting around the grounds other than
to use the lavatory, you will answer to me.

611
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:44,485
Is that understood?”

612
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:45,845
We all nodded mutely.

613
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:46,325
“Good.

614
00:39:46,325 --> 00:39:54,205
Secondly, during the hours outside of curfew, you are
allowed anywhere on the grounds except the dragon stables.

615
00:39:54,205 --> 00:40:00,045
Until you are promoted to the rank of Adept, you might be
lucky enough to glimpse a dragon in passing.

616
00:40:00,045 --> 00:40:10,245
Dragons are powerful and cunning creatures, and until you’ve mastered the skills necessary to keep from falling under
their power, you will not get within fifty feet of one.

617
00:40:10,245 --> 00:40:12,165
Is that also understood?”

618
00:40:12,165 --> 00:40:17,365
I swallowed hard and nodded, remembering how the dragon
earlier had only been a few feet away.

619
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:22,565
Not only could the dragon have eaten me, but it seemed that
they had powers?

620
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:25,605
Were they able to use magic like sorcerers?

621
00:40:25,645 --> 00:40:34,045
I knew that a dragoon and a dragon had a special bond, but apart from that small knowledge, my father hadn’t told me
much more.

622
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:39,685
“Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, you must not share
the details of your tests with each other.

623
00:40:39,685 --> 00:40:49,445
The tests you will go through are different for every student and the results are for the Curates and Master Pevus
to determine your worthiness of bonding with a dragon.

624
00:40:49,445 --> 00:40:55,645
If you share your test details, you will immediately be removed from the Citadel and your memory will be magically
wiped.

625
00:40:55,645 --> 00:41:02,485
You will not remember this place, or of ever being here.”

626
00:41:02,485 --> 00:41:04,125
My eyes widened in surprise.

627
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:07,245
I knew less about magic than I did about dragons.

628
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:12,885
The idea that a single person had the power to remove
memories was … frightening, at the least.

629
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:16,645
If a sorcerer could do that, what else were they capable of?

630
00:41:16,645 --> 00:41:21,405
“There are other, minor rules, but these three are
inarguable.

631
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:25,605
You will not be able to contest them if you are guilty of
breaking them.

632
00:41:25,605 --> 00:41:29,565
Do you all understand the rules as I have explained them?”

633
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:32,565
There was more nodding, but Anesko didn’t seem satisfied.

634
00:41:32,565 --> 00:41:35,205
“I want to hear your understanding,” he said.

635
00:41:35,205 --> 00:41:37,645
“Yes, Curate,” a few of us said.

636
00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:39,965
“Everyone at once,” he demanded.

637
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:43,605
“Yes, Curate,” all of our voices rose together.

638
00:41:43,605 --> 00:41:45,205
“Excellent.

639
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:51,445
Normally, testing would begin in the morning, but Master
Pevus has decided to push it back a day.

640
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:55,325
You are all free tomorrow to enjoy the day as you see fit.

641
00:41:55,325 --> 00:42:00,805
I would suggest getting to know your surroundings and
learning the maze of hallways.

642
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:06,045
Meals are served at the second bell, the seventh bell, and
the thirteenth bell.

643
00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:10,205
If you don’t eat at the designated times, you don’t eat.”

644
00:42:10,205 --> 00:42:12,485
This was supposed to be a school.

645
00:42:12,485 --> 00:42:14,565
Why were the rules so harsh?

646
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,565
Forcing students to go hungry seemed wrong.

647
00:42:17,565 --> 00:42:21,405
Granted, going hungry was something I was accustomed to, but
still.

648
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,565
None of the nobles probably knew what going hungry meant.

649
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:27,605
I found some satisfaction with that idea.

650
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,925
A spoiled noble going hungry might teach them something.

651
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:35,925
“You are all dismissed,” Anesko said, then turned on his
heel and left.

652
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:44,365
After he had disappeared from view, Maren loudly joked,
“That guy needs to lighten up.

653
00:42:44,405 --> 00:42:46,325
Life is not that serious.”

654
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:51,885
I grinned at her, but everyone else ignored her and trekked
up the staircase that led to our rooms.

655
00:42:51,925 --> 00:42:53,805
Maren and I went up last.

656
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:59,325
She kept glancing around and I had a feeling she was up to
something.

657
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:03,766
“What are you doing tomorrow?” she asked, her voice much
lower than before.

658
00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:06,526
“Learning my way around the school,” I replied.

659
00:43:06,526 --> 00:43:10,646
“That sounds boring,” she huffed. “Want to go see the
dragons again?

660
00:43:10,646 --> 00:43:14,286
Maybe this time one won’t throw up on you and we’ll get to
touch one.”

661
00:43:14,286 --> 00:43:22,166
I stopped mid-step and looked at her incredulously. “Were you not listening to the Curate, or are you itching for
trouble?

662
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,326
We’re not allowed to go into the stables.”

663
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:27,286
“Rules were made to be broken, Eldwin.”

664
00:43:27,286 --> 00:43:32,686
“Trust me,” I said, raising my mangled hand for her to see.
“Rules are in place for good reason.”

665
00:43:32,686 --> 00:43:38,566
Maren stared at my hand in silence for a moment, then opened
her mouth as if she was going to say something.

666
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:43,366
Instead, she pursed her lips and nodded once, then continued
up the stairs.

667
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:44,126
Finally.

668
00:43:44,126 --> 00:43:46,726
Maybe she could learn to follow the rules after all.

669
00:43:46,726 --> 00:43:50,526
I stepped into my room, the third door from the staircase.

670
00:43:50,566 --> 00:43:52,526
Simon was already inside.

671
00:43:52,566 --> 00:43:58,726
He’d had his belongings delivered by a servant, and his
stuff was neatly arranged on one side of the room.

672
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:01,206
I only had the clothes I was wearing.

673
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:02,526
It didn’t bother me too much.

674
00:44:02,566 --> 00:44:04,406
I tried to look at the bright side.

675
00:44:04,446 --> 00:44:07,806
After all, I didn’t have to lug around a bunch of things.

676
00:44:07,806 --> 00:44:13,846
I sat on my bed and slipped my worn boots off, then laid
back and stared up at the ceiling.

677
00:44:13,846 --> 00:44:17,766
From the corner of my eye, I could see that Simon was
blatantly ignoring me.

678
00:44:17,806 --> 00:44:21,286
I tried to hide my smile, just in case he was looking my
way.

679
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:24,526
Maren had a fiery, rebellious personality.

680
00:44:24,526 --> 00:44:30,726
That wouldn’t be a bad thing if she were a noble, but low
borns couldn’t get away with acting rash like that.

681
00:44:30,726 --> 00:44:34,206
Still, I found her alluring like a poisonous flower.

682
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:38,086
She was nice to look at, but if you got too close, she would
infect you.

683
00:44:38,086 --> 00:44:40,446
Perhaps that wouldn’t be so bad.

684
00:44:40,486 --> 00:44:45,646
So long as she didn’t get me kicked out of the Citadel, I
could deal with her intrepid nature.

685
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,526
“Hey,” Simon said brusquely.

686
00:44:47,526 --> 00:44:51,686
“I know, ‘Tell my friend to watch her back.’ I got your
warning, Simon.”

687
00:44:51,686 --> 00:44:53,606
“What are you blabbering on about?” he asked.

688
00:44:53,606 --> 00:44:56,246
I sat up and looked at him. “In the lavatory.

689
00:44:56,246 --> 00:44:59,206
I heard your veiled threat about Maren.”

690
00:44:59,206 --> 00:45:06,246
Simon looked genuinely confused. “I don’t know who you heard, but it wasn’t me.” He shook his head and muttered
something under his breath.

691
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:07,686
“Right.

692
00:45:07,686 --> 00:45:09,886
What did you want to say, then?” I asked.

693
00:45:09,886 --> 00:45:15,246
“I was going to say that I think it would be best if you
left now while you have a choice in the matter.

694
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:19,926
That hand isn’t going to do you any favors around here.”

695
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:23,006
“How selfless of you,” I replied, then laid back down.

696
00:45:23,046 --> 00:45:33,606
“I’m trying to help you keep your honor intact,” Simon said. “You may not have been born a noble, but your father’s Deed
shouldn’t be disparaged because you’re too stubborn to give up.”

697
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:37,326
“I can’t give up,” I said. “I have nothing without this
school.”

698
00:45:37,326 --> 00:45:38,966
There was a long moment of silence.

699
00:45:38,966 --> 00:45:42,246
I looked over at Simon to see why he hadn’t said anything.

700
00:45:42,246 --> 00:45:44,286
He was on his bed, his back to me.

701
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,286
I rolled my eyes.

702
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,686
How dare he try to tell me what my father’s honor was worth?

703
00:45:49,766 --> 00:45:53,606
I knew more than anyone, especially some spoiled noble brat.

704
00:45:53,606 --> 00:45:56,526
I was still fuming when I heard Simon snoring.

705
00:45:56,566 --> 00:46:02,206
It wasn’t too loud, but I was having trouble falling asleep
and the sound was annoying.

706
00:46:02,206 --> 00:46:07,926
I rolled off the bed and left the room, then headed down the
stairs and navigated my way to the lavatory.

707
00:46:07,926 --> 00:46:11,326
The stone floor was cold on my feet, but it felt good.

708
00:46:11,406 --> 00:46:17,926
I splashed some water from a bucket onto my face and stared
into one of the mirrors that hung on the wall.

709
00:46:17,966 --> 00:46:19,126
My eyes were red.

710
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:22,446
I was physically exhausted, but I couldn’t sleep.

711
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,886
My mind was running in every direction.

712
00:46:25,886 --> 00:46:32,886
I headed back to the North Wing intending to try and force myself to sleep, but I saw a shadow dart down the hall to
the left.

713
00:46:32,886 --> 00:46:40,686
I knew I should have just minded my own business, but my
curiosity was piqued, and I slowly followed after the
shadow.

714
00:46:40,686 --> 00:46:43,366
As I turned the corner, I recognized Maren.

715
00:46:43,366 --> 00:46:46,846
She was surprisingly quiet for how fast she was moving.

716
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:48,646
“Maren!” I whispered loudly.

717
00:46:48,646 --> 00:46:52,286
She must not have heard me, for she disappeared into the
shadows.

718
00:46:52,286 --> 00:46:57,806
I almost went after her, but I didn’t want to risk being
caught by the Curate.

719
00:46:57,806 --> 00:47:03,366
I made it back to my room and climbed into bed, then laid
there and tried to clear my mind.

720
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:06,886
When the sun rose and Simon got up, I was still awake.

721
00:47:06,926 --> 00:47:09,406
The day was going to be a rough one.

722
00:47:09,446 --> 00:47:10,446
CHAPTER SIX

723
00:47:10,526 --> 00:47:13,366
I managed to get down to the dining hall in time for
breakfast.

724
00:47:13,366 --> 00:47:20,326
There were small mountains of scrambled eggs, buttered
toast, and thick sausages piled on the serving table.

725
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:26,766
I wasn’t as hungry as I expected to be, so I ate a minimal
amount and listened to the conversations around me.

726
00:47:26,766 --> 00:47:33,726
A few people talked about how they thought the Curate was
rude, and others talked about wanting to see the dragons.

727
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,846
Maren was unsurprisingly absent.

728
00:47:35,846 --> 00:47:38,966
I figured she had probably snuck down to see the dragons
already.

729
00:47:38,966 --> 00:47:41,326
She was going to get caught, I was sure of it.

730
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:45,166
I’d be sad to see her go, but it would be her fault for
breaking the rules.

731
00:47:45,206 --> 00:47:48,686
I wondered where she had gone last night, but there was no
telling.

732
00:47:48,686 --> 00:47:49,926
She was a free spirit.

733
00:47:49,926 --> 00:47:55,406
I decided to check out the market in Autumnwick since I
doubted that we would get many days to ourselves.

734
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:59,806
I didn’t have any money to spend, but I just wanted to get
some fresh air.

735
00:47:59,846 --> 00:48:05,006
It was surprising that I wasn’t falling asleep standing up
since I hadn’t slept at all the night before.

736
00:48:05,046 --> 00:48:09,966
As I walked down the various aisles of stalls, I saw wares
of all kinds.

737
00:48:09,966 --> 00:48:14,326
Swords and armor, meats and pastries, and many things I
didn’t recognize.

738
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:17,646
Since it was still early in the morning, the crowds were
light.

739
00:48:17,646 --> 00:48:22,006
I stopped at a stall that had daggers and admired the
craftsmanship.

740
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:24,126
One, in particular, caught my eye.

741
00:48:24,286 --> 00:48:29,726
The hilt was fashioned in the design of a dragon’s head, and
the blade was curved like a dragon tooth.

742
00:48:29,726 --> 00:48:35,606
It would be a good match for my sword, but I didn’t bother
asking the vendor how much it cost.

743
00:48:35,606 --> 00:48:39,086
Someone came up beside me and I moved aside to give them
space.

744
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:41,366
“Eldwin.” It was Simon’s voice.

745
00:48:41,366 --> 00:48:44,486
I looked over, surprised to find him in the market.

746
00:48:44,486 --> 00:48:54,046
Nobles usually sent servants out for them, but considering he was in the school now, I supposed Simon would have to get
used to doing things for himself.

747
00:48:54,086 --> 00:48:55,966
“Simon,” I replied tersely.

748
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:59,286
“I wanted to apologize for what I said last night,” he said.

749
00:48:59,286 --> 00:49:00,926
Confusion assaulted my mind.

750
00:49:01,046 --> 00:49:03,326
Simon wanted to apologize?

751
00:49:03,366 --> 00:49:08,326
I blinked a few times, my mind trying to wrap itself around
his words.

752
00:49:08,326 --> 00:49:10,726
“I could have been less abrasive with what I said.

753
00:49:10,726 --> 00:49:14,766
It’s just hard to hear everyone talking badly about you
because of your hand.

754
00:49:14,806 --> 00:49:19,526
Your father was a hero, and even though he was low born,
it’s not right.

755
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:21,366
I was just trying to help.”

756
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:23,966
“Well, you were also talking about my hand.”

757
00:49:23,966 --> 00:49:24,486
“I know.

758
00:49:24,486 --> 00:49:25,406
I’m sorry.”

759
00:49:25,406 --> 00:49:26,806
Simon was confusing me.

760
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:31,286
He was a noble, and nobles were all the same.

761
00:49:31,286 --> 00:49:34,646
Selfish, self-absorbed, and high maintenance.

762
00:49:34,646 --> 00:49:36,566
Yet here he was apologizing.

763
00:49:36,566 --> 00:49:42,286
I would never have imagined a noble apologizing in general,
but especially not to me.

764
00:49:42,286 --> 00:49:47,526
“Don’t worry about it,” I said. “I’m used to it, trust me.”

765
00:49:47,566 --> 00:49:49,406
“I want to make it up to you,” Simon said.

766
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:51,166
“You don’t have to,” I said.

767
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:53,966
“I want to,” he replied. “Come with me.”

768
00:49:53,966 --> 00:49:55,566
Simon walked away before I could argue.

769
00:49:55,566 --> 00:49:59,326
I watched him and debated on whether or not to follow him.

770
00:49:59,326 --> 00:50:04,886
The internal debate lasted a few seconds, then I sighed and
hurried to catch up to him.

771
00:50:04,886 --> 00:50:06,166
I wasn’t too proud.

772
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:10,166
“Really,” I said. “You don’t have to do anything.”

773
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:11,726
“It’s the least I can do.”

774
00:50:11,726 --> 00:50:15,006
Simon turned to the left, away from the market and down an
alley.

775
00:50:15,006 --> 00:50:18,886
I wasn’t sure where he was leading me, but I continued to
follow him.

776
00:50:18,886 --> 00:50:20,806
Another left took us behind a building.

777
00:50:20,806 --> 00:50:24,726
There was a group of guards leaning against the building’s
wall.

778
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:28,926
A feeling of uneasiness swept over me as I saw the men were
city guards.

779
00:50:28,966 --> 00:50:35,126
I started to backstep, but the clink of chainmail alerted me
to more guards closing in from behind.

780
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:39,566
I instinctively reached for my sword but remembered it was
in the Citadel’s armory.

781
00:50:39,566 --> 00:50:41,646
My heart started hammering in my chest.

782
00:50:41,646 --> 00:50:49,766
“Well done, Simon,” one of the guards said. “I was starting to think he had left the city before I could give him a
proper introduction to Autumnwick.”

783
00:50:49,806 --> 00:50:53,567
The guard who spoke stepped forward and I recognized him
from the other day.

784
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,807
He was the one who had accosted Maren before I intervened.

785
00:50:56,847 --> 00:51:02,847
I swallowed hard, knowing that whatever he had in store for
me, it couldn’t be good.

786
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:05,087
“What’s your name?” the guard asked.

787
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:08,607
I remained silent, but Simon spoke up.

788
00:51:08,687 --> 00:51:10,007
“His name is Eldwin.

789
00:51:10,007 --> 00:51:14,767
His father was Matthias Baines.”

790
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:18,607
The guard tilted his head slightly. “The war hero?” he
asked.

791
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:20,407
“The same,” Simon answered.

792
00:51:20,407 --> 00:51:24,407
“It’s a shame he raised a son who doesn’t know how to mind
his own business.

793
00:51:24,407 --> 00:51:33,247
Either way, I’m going to enjoy teaching him a lesson.” He motioned with his hand and the guards behind me grabbed my
arms roughly, holding me in place.

794
00:51:33,287 --> 00:51:37,847
“You see, Eldwin, here in Autumnwick, we city guards don’t
care for dragoons.

795
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:41,807
Granted, you aren’t one yet, but you’re trying to earn your
way in.

796
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,927
Do you know why we don’t like dragoons?”

797
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:46,927
I stared back at him, trying to make myself look defiant.

798
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:49,887
If it worked, the guard didn’t bother to acknowledge it.

799
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,447
“It’s because they let people like you in.

800
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:55,207
Crippled, low born, damaged people.

801
00:51:55,207 --> 00:52:00,847
How do they expect people like you to defend the kingdom?”
He shook his head. “Look at his blasted hand!

802
00:52:00,847 --> 00:52:03,167
He can’t even properly hold a sword.”

803
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:06,287
“I can wield a blade,” I finally spoke.

804
00:52:06,287 --> 00:52:08,287
“Ah, so now he speaks.

805
00:52:08,327 --> 00:52:12,807
I doubt that you have the strength in that hand to hold a
real man’s sword.”

806
00:52:12,807 --> 00:52:18,967
“My father’s blade is more of a real man’s sword than you’ve
ever seen.” Anger was beginning to simmer within me.

807
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:23,687
“Is that right?” The guard stepped closer, drawing only a
few inches from me.

808
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:27,727
I could smell the leather of his armor, along with the scent
of his body odor.

809
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,047
I scrunched my nose.

810
00:52:29,047 --> 00:52:31,567
He needed to take a bath.

811
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:35,567
“Jon, you said you were only going to scare him a bit,”
Simon said.

812
00:52:35,567 --> 00:52:38,287
I looked at him, but he didn’t meet my gaze.

813
00:52:38,287 --> 00:52:42,807
“I am,” Jon replied. “But he doesn’t seem scared yet.”

814
00:52:42,807 --> 00:52:46,607
Pain lanced through my stomach as Jon drove his fist into
me.

815
00:52:46,687 --> 00:52:50,767
I would have crumbled to my knees if his cronies wouldn’t
have been holding my arms.

816
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:52,967
I sucked in air between coughs.

817
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:59,767
The realization that Simon had tricked me only made me
angrier, but I was outnumbered and overpowered.

818
00:52:59,767 --> 00:53:04,367
“You’re pathetic,” Jon spat. “You’ll always live in your
father’s shadow.

819
00:53:04,367 --> 00:53:07,487
At least he’s not alive to see how wretched you are.”

820
00:53:07,527 --> 00:53:08,887
Jon punched me again.

821
00:53:08,887 --> 00:53:14,487
His guards released my arms and I fell to the ground.

822
00:53:14,487 --> 00:53:16,767
Dust rose and got into my mouth.

823
00:53:16,807 --> 00:53:21,807
It made my teeth gritty and I wanted to spit it out, but it
was all I could do to breathe.

824
00:53:21,847 --> 00:53:22,887
“Come on, Jon.

825
00:53:22,927 --> 00:53:25,047
Just leave him here.” It was Simon again.

826
00:53:25,087 --> 00:53:29,407
Maybe he felt bad and that was why he was trying to
intervene.

827
00:53:29,487 --> 00:53:30,407
It didn’t matter.

828
00:53:30,447 --> 00:53:31,407
He’d betrayed me.

829
00:53:31,447 --> 00:53:38,127
Dragoons were supposed to defend the kingdom and protect its
people, yet Simon was no better than these petty guards.

830
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:40,167
“That’s a good idea, Simon.

831
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:41,207
I will leave him here.

832
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,047
That way, no one will find his body.”

833
00:53:44,047 --> 00:53:47,447
I heard ringing steel and looked up to see Jon had drawn his
sword.

834
00:53:47,487 --> 00:53:51,087
Terror forced my limbs to move, and I struggled to my feet.

835
00:53:51,087 --> 00:53:55,847
The guards behind me shoved me back to the ground and my
knees struck the dirt painfully.

836
00:53:55,847 --> 00:54:00,327
“What are you doing?” Simon demanded. “You can’t murder
someone!”

837
00:54:00,327 --> 00:54:02,967
“I can do as I see fit,” Jon rebuked.

838
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:04,647
“I won’t let you.”

839
00:54:04,647 --> 00:54:06,287
“Watch yourself, Simon.

840
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:09,927
You may be a noble, but my father outranks yours.”

841
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:14,247
I prepared myself to get up and make a run for it as Jon
lifted his sword.

842
00:54:14,327 --> 00:54:20,967
Simon cried out in protest and grabbed ahold of Jon’s arm as
Jon started to swing, which threw his motion off.

843
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:24,007
The blade swung narrowly past my face.

844
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:28,087
I crawled backward and bumped into the legs of the guards
behind me.

845
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:30,287
Simon and Jon struggled against one another.

846
00:54:30,327 --> 00:54:33,807
I started to get to my feet, but one of the guards struck me
in the head.

847
00:54:33,807 --> 00:54:38,327
Agony screamed throughout my body.

848
00:54:38,327 --> 00:54:41,327
I gasped and my vision threatened to go black.

849
00:54:41,327 --> 00:54:44,447
I fought against unconsciousness, but it was a losing
battle.

850
00:54:44,487 --> 00:54:51,327
A bright flash of light and a sound like thunder echoed
against the buildings around us.

851
00:54:51,327 --> 00:55:01,167
I was already dazed, and the light blinded me, stabbing into my eyes and bursting into the back of my skull like a
thousand tiny hot shards of glass.

852
00:55:01,207 --> 00:55:08,927
I screamed, unable to bear the pain, but I couldn’t hear
myself over the roaring thunder.

853
00:55:08,967 --> 00:55:13,727
It seemed like the world was ending, ending in burning light
and rumbling noise.

854
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,887
I could see faint outlines of the guards rushing past me.

855
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:24,687
Just before the darkness of oblivion took me into its
embrace, I thought I saw a face contorted with rage.

856
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:25,767
Maren’s face.

857
00:55:25,767 --> 00:55:27,087
CHAPTER SEVEN

858
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:30,327
When I awoke, I had no idea where I was.

859
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,927
My mind seemed foggy as if it was stuffed with cotton.

860
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:39,207
I was lying on my back, staring up at a white ceiling.

861
00:55:39,207 --> 00:55:41,967
I was parched, and my lips were chapped.

862
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:46,007
Running my dry tongue over them was like using sandstone to
moisturize.

863
00:55:46,007 --> 00:55:49,247
“Water,” I rasped as I tried to sit up.

864
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:53,007
A wave of nausea washed over me and I had to lie back down.

865
00:55:53,007 --> 00:55:57,247
A dull pain throbbed in my stomach, and I vaguely remembered
Jon hitting me.

866
00:55:57,247 --> 00:56:03,127
It felt like an eternity before the nausea passed and I was
able to force myself into a sitting position.

867
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:05,447
There were two people in the room with me.

868
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:09,647
I immediately recognized Curate Anesko, but I didn’t know
the other person.

869
00:56:09,647 --> 00:56:13,727
It was a woman, and instead of gray or brown robes, she wore
white ones.

870
00:56:13,727 --> 00:56:17,967
She walked over to me carrying a wooden pitcher and cup.

871
00:56:17,967 --> 00:56:20,847
She poured some water into the cup and handed it to me.

872
00:56:20,887 --> 00:56:24,767
I started to take a sip but noticed tiny leaves floating in
the water.

873
00:56:24,767 --> 00:56:26,487
I looked at the woman curiously.

874
00:56:26,487 --> 00:56:28,647
“It’ll help with the pain,” she said.

875
00:56:28,647 --> 00:56:32,127
I was too thirsty to care whether that was true or not.

876
00:56:32,127 --> 00:56:36,647
I drank deeply, downing the entire cup as if I hadn’t had
water in weeks.

877
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:40,367
“Where am I?” I choked out as I handed the empty cup to her.

878
00:56:40,367 --> 00:56:43,967
She sprinkled some more leaves into the cup and refilled it.

879
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:47,247
“The infirmary,” she replied. “How are you feeling?”

880
00:56:47,247 --> 00:56:51,847
“Rough,” I said. “I’ve felt worse, though.” I held my hand
up for emphasis.

881
00:56:51,847 --> 00:56:53,887
“How did I get here?” I asked.

882
00:56:53,887 --> 00:56:57,167
“I’ll let Curate Anesko answer that,” she said.

883
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:59,087
She glanced back at him and he joined us.

884
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:02,087
“What were you doing in the market?” Anesko asked.

885
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:05,367
His tone wasn’t filled with tenderness like the healer.

886
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:07,807
“I was browsing the vendors.”

887
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:10,727
“How did you end up behind the money changers building?”

888
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:16,807
I didn’t know what a money changer was, but I assumed he
meant the building Simon had led me behind.

889
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:20,647
I opened my mouth to answer and paused.

890
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:27,247
Simon had betrayed me, true, but he also tried to defend me
when he realized Jon was going to kill me.

891
00:57:27,247 --> 00:57:32,887
I considered whether I owed him any favors, and decided that
his actions had canceled each other out.

892
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:34,767
I didn’t owe him anything.

893
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:39,247
“Simon tricked me into going behind the building with a
promise of giving me something.

894
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,487
The only thing back there was the city guards.

895
00:57:41,487 --> 00:57:43,647
They tried to kill me.”

896
00:57:43,647 --> 00:57:45,807
Anesko exchanged glances with the healer.

897
00:57:45,807 --> 00:57:52,687
“Drink this,” the woman said, then she and Anesko stepped
away and held a whispered conversation.

898
00:57:52,727 --> 00:57:54,407
I couldn’t hear what they were saying.

899
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:57,127
A low ringing sound had taken up residence in my ears.

900
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:01,047
I sipped the water and looked around the infirmary.

901
00:58:01,127 --> 00:58:06,767
The walls were white like the ceiling, but the floor was the
same gray stone as the rest of the Citadel.

902
00:58:06,807 --> 00:58:11,407
Rows of beds were lined in orderly rows, all of them empty
except one.

903
00:58:11,407 --> 00:58:17,287
I hadn’t noticed before, but someone was lying in the bed
with a bandage wrapped around their torso.

904
00:58:17,287 --> 00:58:20,487
A large vibrant red stained the sterile fabric.

905
00:58:20,487 --> 00:58:21,327
Blood.

906
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:22,247
Lots of it.

907
00:58:22,247 --> 00:58:25,727
Anesko and the healer came back over and I turned my
attention to them.

908
00:58:25,727 --> 00:58:31,967
“I’m going to escort you to your room,” Anesko said. “You
can rest there for the remainder of the day.

909
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:38,367
Tomorrow begins the first test, and unfortunately, if you
don’t test tomorrow, you don’t test at all.”

910
00:58:38,367 --> 00:58:42,688
“He needs at least three more days to rest,” the healer
interjected.

911
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,648
“I don’t make the rules, Anessa.

912
00:58:44,648 --> 00:58:46,168
I enforce them.”

913
00:58:46,168 --> 00:58:51,168
“It’s fine,” I said. “I’m feeling a little rough, but I can
take the test.”

914
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:55,088
“Are you sure?” Anessa asked, her face etched with worry.

915
00:58:55,088 --> 00:58:57,528
“I have to.

916
00:58:57,528 --> 00:59:03,088
This is my only chance.” I couldn’t be sure, but I thought I
saw a bit of a smirk on Anesko’s lips.

917
00:59:03,128 --> 00:59:06,368
Was he proud of me, or was he trying not to laugh at my
weakness?

918
00:59:06,368 --> 00:59:08,808
I supposed it didn’t matter either way.

919
00:59:08,808 --> 00:59:13,288
“If anything happens to him, I will not be pleased,” Anessa
warned the Curate.

920
00:59:13,328 --> 00:59:15,768
Anesko rolled his eyes and offered me his hand.

921
00:59:15,768 --> 00:59:17,808
I accepted it and slid off the bed.

922
00:59:17,808 --> 00:59:22,048
Without another word, the Curate led me through the
infirmary toward the door.

923
00:59:22,048 --> 00:59:25,968
As we passed by the bed with the bloodied person, I saw that
it was Simon.

924
00:59:25,968 --> 00:59:27,688
My eyes widened in surprise.

925
00:59:27,688 --> 00:59:30,048
“What happened to Simon?” I asked.

926
00:59:30,048 --> 00:59:31,568
“He was stabbed,” Anesko replied.

927
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,928
“Stabbed?” I remembered his scuffle with Jon.

928
00:59:34,928 --> 00:59:37,328
The guard must have gained the upper hand.

929
00:59:37,328 --> 00:59:42,448
I clenched my jaw in anger, which only added to my headache.
“Will he be all right?”

930
00:59:42,448 --> 00:59:43,648
“Don’t worry about him.

931
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:46,528
You have enough of your own problems.”

932
00:59:46,528 --> 00:59:50,608
I wasn’t sure what Anesko meant by that, and I didn’t bother
asking.

933
00:59:50,608 --> 00:59:52,768
We walked through the hallways in silence.

934
00:59:52,808 --> 00:59:56,808
Anesko kept his pace slow enough that I was able to keep up.

935
00:59:56,848 --> 01:00:03,088
The pain in my stomach was still there, but it had
diminished enough that it was more an annoyance than
anything else.

936
01:00:03,128 --> 01:00:06,648
Once we reached the staircase that led up to my floor,
Anesko stopped.

937
01:00:06,648 --> 01:00:11,568
He turned to face me and I saw that the hardness in his eyes
had lessened.

938
01:00:11,568 --> 01:00:17,648
“I don’t know why Simon and the city guard have it out for you, but I can only assume it has something to do with who
your father is.

939
01:00:17,688 --> 01:00:21,728
Perhaps they think that beating on you will gain them some
sort of reputation.

940
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:27,008
People are stupid when they are young, and today’s events
only solidify that for me.”

941
01:00:27,008 --> 01:00:30,408
Anesko sighed and rubbed his eyes with the tips of his
fingers.

942
01:00:30,408 --> 01:00:31,568
He seemed stressed.

943
01:00:31,568 --> 01:00:35,768
There had to be more going on than just my situation.

944
01:00:35,808 --> 01:00:38,648
I was involved and I wasn’t as strained as he was.

945
01:00:38,688 --> 01:00:43,448
“Someone used magic in that fight,” he added. “It was a
powerful spell, too.

946
01:00:43,488 --> 01:00:45,088
I don’t think the guards did it.

947
01:00:45,128 --> 01:00:48,608
They aren’t trained in the ways that students of the Citadel
are.

948
01:00:48,608 --> 01:00:51,288
Using magic against another person is illegal.

949
01:00:51,288 --> 01:00:52,608
I have to ask.

950
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:55,008
Did you use magic against those guards?”

951
01:00:55,048 --> 01:00:59,328
“No,” I answered. “I didn’t even know that what happened was
the result of magic.

952
01:00:59,328 --> 01:01:02,808
I was barely conscious when I got blinded.”

953
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:03,608
“Good.

954
01:01:03,608 --> 01:01:05,608
Do you know who cast the spell?”

955
01:01:05,608 --> 01:01:06,608
“No, Curate.

956
01:01:06,608 --> 01:01:09,208
I didn’t see anyone other than the guards.

957
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:15,288
And Simon.” The memory of Maren’s angry face flashed in my
mind’s eye.

958
01:01:15,288 --> 01:01:20,168
If that was real, I think I did know who cast the spell, but
I would never tell anyone.

959
01:01:20,168 --> 01:01:23,648
Anesko frowned. “We will have to find the person who did.

960
01:01:23,648 --> 01:01:31,248
Someone with magic that powerful must be trained to properly
use it, or they risk the lives of everyone around them.”

961
01:01:31,248 --> 01:01:33,008
I nodded, not sure what to say.

962
01:01:33,008 --> 01:01:34,928
I just wanted to go back to sleep.

963
01:01:34,928 --> 01:01:37,328
I was sure the Curate could see my exhaustion.

964
01:01:37,328 --> 01:01:38,808
“Listen to me, Eldiwn.

965
01:01:38,808 --> 01:01:39,528
Listen well.

966
01:01:39,528 --> 01:01:40,728
The tests are not easy.

967
01:01:40,728 --> 01:01:43,648
They will push you in ways you’ve never dreamed of.

968
01:01:43,648 --> 01:01:53,568
It is no small feat to pass the tests, but also know that passing the tests is only scratching the surface of what
being a dragoon holds.

969
01:01:53,568 --> 01:01:56,928
Did your father ever talk about his time here?”

970
01:01:56,928 --> 01:01:59,168
I shook my head. “No, Curate.”

971
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:01,248
“There is a good reason for that, trust me.

972
01:02:01,288 --> 01:02:05,048
Before the testing is done, you will wish that you were
dead.

973
01:02:05,048 --> 01:02:07,248
I know I did.”

974
01:02:07,248 --> 01:02:09,608
“Thank you for letting me know,” I said.

975
01:02:09,648 --> 01:02:15,368
Anesko stared at me, his eyes probing my soul, looking for
any hesitation or weakness.

976
01:02:15,368 --> 01:02:17,648
I was determined to pass the tests.

977
01:02:17,648 --> 01:02:20,728
Being a dragoon was all there was for me.

978
01:02:20,768 --> 01:02:26,248
If I didn’t pass and bond with a dragon, I had no idea what
I would do, or where I would go.

979
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:30,048
The lands my father’s Deed had earned were dead like my
parents.

980
01:02:30,128 --> 01:02:33,168
No crops grew there and water was non-existent.

981
01:02:33,168 --> 01:02:34,288
This was all I had.

982
01:02:34,288 --> 01:02:40,888
The Curate placed a hand on my shoulder. “Get some rest,” he
said. “You’re going to need it.”

983
01:02:40,888 --> 01:02:41,768
And then he left.

984
01:02:41,768 --> 01:02:46,448
I stood there for a moment, running his words through my
mind, over and over.

985
01:02:46,448 --> 01:02:48,928
I made my way up the stairs slowly.

986
01:02:48,968 --> 01:02:51,648
Every muscle in my body was sore.

987
01:02:51,648 --> 01:02:56,808
By the time I reached the top, I was tempted to get on my
knees and crawl the rest of the way.

988
01:02:56,808 --> 01:03:01,048
Yet somehow, I had enough strength to make it to my room and
into bed.

989
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:03,288
I fell asleep almost immediately.

990
01:03:03,288 --> 01:03:07,648
I awoke to the sound of the Citadel’s bell ringing and
quickly sat up.

991
01:03:07,648 --> 01:03:08,808
What bell was it?

992
01:03:08,808 --> 01:03:10,008
What day was it?

993
01:03:10,008 --> 01:03:17,328
I rolled out of bed and was happy to find that other than a
dull soreness in my stomach, I felt completely rested.

994
01:03:17,368 --> 01:03:20,448
At the foot of my bed was a folded set of gray robes.

995
01:03:20,488 --> 01:03:26,168
I figured I was supposed to wear them, so I put them on over
my clothes and headed down to the dining hall.

996
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:30,288
It was empty aside from a few servants doing some cleaning.

997
01:03:30,288 --> 01:03:32,888
“What bell is it?” I asked one of them.

998
01:03:32,888 --> 01:03:35,008
“Fifth,” the man answered.

999
01:03:35,008 --> 01:03:39,928
I thanked him and then sprinted for the temple, hoping I
wasn’t too late.

1000
01:03:39,928 --> 01:03:41,048
CHAPTER EIGHT

1001
01:03:41,088 --> 01:03:42,328
I rushed into the temple.

1002
01:03:42,368 --> 01:03:47,568
To my relief, everyone was seated and appeared to be waiting
for Master Pevus.

1003
01:03:47,608 --> 01:03:51,688
I slipped into the last pew, trying to be as quiet as
possible.

1004
01:03:51,768 --> 01:03:56,688
Nobody appeared to notice my tardiness, or if they did, they
didn’t care.

1005
01:03:56,688 --> 01:03:59,688
I spotted Maren sitting in one of the middle rows.

1006
01:03:59,728 --> 01:04:02,608
I thought about how I had seen her face during my attack.

1007
01:04:02,648 --> 01:04:04,728
There had been so much rage in her eyes.

1008
01:04:04,728 --> 01:04:06,928
Thinking about it now gave me a chill.

1009
01:04:06,928 --> 01:04:11,928
Was she the one who had cast the powerful spell Curate
Anesko mentioned?

1010
01:04:11,928 --> 01:04:13,088
I didn’t know.

1011
01:04:13,088 --> 01:04:13,488
Wait.

1012
01:04:13,488 --> 01:04:16,528
I considered the many odd statements she’d said.

1013
01:04:16,568 --> 01:04:19,728
Things about people wanting to help her for personal gain.

1014
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:21,408
What if she was a sorcerer?

1015
01:04:21,408 --> 01:04:23,848
That thought gave me pause.

1016
01:04:23,848 --> 01:04:27,888
The only sorcerer I had ever met was an old hedge witch when
I was eight.

1017
01:04:27,888 --> 01:04:33,128
I’d been violently ill and my mother had tried every remedy
she could think of, but nothing worked.

1018
01:04:33,128 --> 01:04:36,728
In desperation, she’d taken me to see Yizell.

1019
01:04:36,728 --> 01:04:43,608
The old witch had looked ancient and moved slow, but she was
kind and offered a concoction that ended my sickness.

1020
01:04:43,608 --> 01:04:51,168
Given that it was my only interaction with a magic user, it
was hard to fathom the anger one of them could possess.

1021
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:56,768
And yet, if it was Maren who had cast the spell … she had
done it to save me.

1022
01:04:56,808 --> 01:05:01,568
Master Pevus strode into the room then, his robes fluttering
around him.

1023
01:05:01,608 --> 01:05:05,368
He stood on the raised dais and cleared his throat.

1024
01:05:05,408 --> 01:05:06,648
I squinted at him.

1025
01:05:06,648 --> 01:05:10,928
He looked like he had aged several years since I had seen
him the other night.

1026
01:05:11,048 --> 01:05:12,048
“Attention!

1027
01:05:12,048 --> 01:05:14,048
Attention, students!”

1028
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:21,168
Once the multitude of voices quieted, Master Pevus
continued.

1029
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:25,248
“Today we will begin Compassion, the first of three tests.

1030
01:05:25,328 --> 01:05:29,368
Only one student will be tested at a time.

1031
01:05:29,368 --> 01:05:32,168
As such, we will break for meals.

1032
01:05:32,168 --> 01:05:41,008
Given that this is such a large group, I’m hoping that we will be finished before the curfew bell, but I am not
completely in control of the test.

1033
01:05:41,048 --> 01:05:47,528
“The magic of the temple is the true master here, and it
will dictate the amount of time you will spend in the test.

1034
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:55,168
I believe the longest any potential student has spent been in the test was three hours, but that is certainly not the
norm.”

1035
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:57,288
Master Pevus motioned at a door to his right.

1036
01:05:57,288 --> 01:06:00,848
“This door will lead you into the chamber where you will be
tested.

1037
01:06:00,848 --> 01:06:07,168
The Curates and I will view the testing, but we will not
interfere unless it is deemed an emergency.”

1038
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:08,848
Someone in the front raised their hand.

1039
01:06:08,848 --> 01:06:09,888
“Yes?”

1040
01:06:09,888 --> 01:06:12,928
“Is the test dangerous?” the person asked.

1041
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:13,928
“Physically, no.

1042
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,728
At least, not that I’ve ever witnessed.

1043
01:06:16,728 --> 01:06:30,209
Mentally, however, is another matter.” Master Pevus paused as if he was uncertain about how to elaborate. “These tests
are designed to investigate the deepest parts of you, the ones that you may not even be aware of.

1044
01:06:30,209 --> 01:06:35,209
Sometimes the tested can be temporarily … damaged, for lack
of a better term.

1045
01:06:35,209 --> 01:06:37,289
But there are no lasting effects.”

1046
01:06:37,329 --> 01:06:40,449
“What happens if you fail the first test?” someone else
asked.

1047
01:06:40,449 --> 01:06:46,689
Master Pevus steepled his fingers and stared down at them
for a moment, then looked back up.

1048
01:06:46,689 --> 01:06:52,249
“If you fail the first test, your memories of this place and
what you did here will be magically erased.

1049
01:06:52,249 --> 01:06:55,529
This is for your safety, as well as ours.

1050
01:06:55,529 --> 01:07:01,169
If you pass the Compassion test, then you will move on to
Magical Aptitude.”

1051
01:07:01,169 --> 01:07:07,449
One of the Curates, I didn’t know her name, walked up to
Master Pevus and whispered something to him.

1052
01:07:07,449 --> 01:07:09,249
He nodded and smiled broadly.

1053
01:07:09,289 --> 01:07:11,169
“We are ready to begin the testing.

1054
01:07:11,169 --> 01:07:17,529
We will start at the first pew and work our way back.

1055
01:07:17,529 --> 01:07:21,929
Out of respect for your fellows, I ask that you keep the
noise to a minimum.”

1056
01:07:21,929 --> 01:07:25,529
Master Pevus pointed to the person sitting at the edge of
the first pew.

1057
01:07:25,529 --> 01:07:27,969
“Will you please join me up here?”

1058
01:07:27,969 --> 01:07:30,569
I recognized the person from my first day.

1059
01:07:30,609 --> 01:07:34,689
He’d been in the group that I had walked in with when we
were assigned rooms with the Provost.

1060
01:07:34,729 --> 01:07:37,809
I didn’t know his name, but he was a low born with brown
hair.

1061
01:07:37,809 --> 01:07:41,849
Master Pevus led him to the door, where one of the Curates
opened it.

1062
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:45,449
The master ushered him inside, then the Curate closed the
door.

1063
01:07:45,489 --> 01:07:51,289
Both the master and the Curate left the room through another
door and the rest of us sat in silence.

1064
01:07:51,289 --> 01:07:59,169
I was hoping there would be some sort of sound or something that let us know the test had started, but I was
disappointed when nothing happened.

1065
01:07:59,169 --> 01:08:02,569
Eventually, people started having whispered conversations.

1066
01:08:02,609 --> 01:08:08,209
After a quarter of an hour, Master Pevus came back into the
room and called up the next person.

1067
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:11,249
And so it went, over and over, until the seventh bell.

1068
01:08:11,249 --> 01:08:14,409
We were released for lunch, and then we went back to the
temple.

1069
01:08:14,449 --> 01:08:15,609
The process continued.

1070
01:08:15,649 --> 01:08:21,249
I wondered where the tested exited the chamber, for they
didn’t come out of the door they entered in.

1071
01:08:21,249 --> 01:08:23,009
I’d find out myself soon enough.

1072
01:08:23,009 --> 01:08:27,409
When we came back from lunch, everyone had moved to the
front rows and changed spots.

1073
01:08:27,409 --> 01:08:29,049
I stayed near the back.

1074
01:08:29,049 --> 01:08:33,609
I wasn’t scared to take the test, but I wasn’t jumping in
excitement, either.

1075
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:39,929
This was the first step towards proving I was worthy of
being a dragoon, and I wasn’t sure if I was ready.

1076
01:08:39,969 --> 01:08:42,409
Maren sat next to me.

1077
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:44,129
I looked at her and she smiled.

1078
01:08:44,129 --> 01:08:45,809
She didn’t seem any different.

1079
01:08:45,809 --> 01:08:47,569
Perhaps I had imagined her face?

1080
01:08:47,649 --> 01:08:49,529
“Are you nervous?” she asked.

1081
01:08:49,529 --> 01:08:50,809
“A little, I guess.

1082
01:08:50,809 --> 01:08:51,929
What about you?”

1083
01:08:51,929 --> 01:08:53,689
“Nope.

1084
01:08:53,689 --> 01:08:54,449
Why are you nervous?”

1085
01:08:54,449 --> 01:09:00,089
I shrugged. “I guess because if I fail, I have nowhere to
go.”

1086
01:09:00,089 --> 01:09:01,409
“What about your family’s land?

1087
01:09:01,409 --> 01:09:02,809
And your mother?”

1088
01:09:02,809 --> 01:09:07,009
“My mother died,” I said softly. “A few weeks before I left
to come here.

1089
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:09,129
She had the wasting sickness.”

1090
01:09:09,129 --> 01:09:12,169
Maren frowned and laid her left hand atop my right.

1091
01:09:12,169 --> 01:09:13,289
My mangled one.

1092
01:09:13,289 --> 01:09:14,969
“I’m sorry,” she said.

1093
01:09:14,969 --> 01:09:18,689
I could feel my eyes well with tears, but I refused to cry.

1094
01:09:18,849 --> 01:09:21,849
I blinked rapidly.

1095
01:09:21,849 --> 01:09:23,089
“What about the land?

1096
01:09:23,089 --> 01:09:24,849
You get to keep it by birthright.”

1097
01:09:24,849 --> 01:09:26,649
“I know, but the land is dead.

1098
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:32,209
Crops won’t grow, and all of the people who worked for my
family left after my father died in battle.

1099
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:34,449
I am a noble in name only.

1100
01:09:34,449 --> 01:09:37,089
There is no money, no food, nothing.

1101
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:39,209
The Citadel is all I have.”

1102
01:09:39,249 --> 01:09:44,129
Maren squeezed my hand and in some unexplainable way, I felt
comforted.

1103
01:09:44,169 --> 01:09:45,809
We didn’t talk much after that.

1104
01:09:45,809 --> 01:09:49,689
And even though we were just waiting, the time went by
quickly.

1105
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:53,169
When our pew was the last, I began to get anxious.

1106
01:09:53,169 --> 01:09:57,289
My palms got sweaty and my heart started beating faster.

1107
01:09:57,289 --> 01:10:02,489
Maren didn’t let go of my hand until it was her turn to
enter the chamber.

1108
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:05,089
“See you on the other side,” she said, grinning.

1109
01:10:05,129 --> 01:10:10,969
I watched her until she disappeared into the chamber, then I
leaned forward and looked down at the floor.

1110
01:10:10,969 --> 01:10:13,649
I was next after her, and there were two people after me.

1111
01:10:13,649 --> 01:10:18,729
I considered asking them to switch places with me, but there
was no reason to delay the inevitable.

1112
01:10:18,729 --> 01:10:24,769
I had spent so much time looking forward to this moment, and
now that it was here, I could hardly believe it.

1113
01:10:24,809 --> 01:10:26,849
I was following in my father’s footsteps.

1114
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,889
I closed my eyes and inhaled deep, measured breaths.

1115
01:10:29,889 --> 01:10:32,569
My mind needed to be clear so I could focus.

1116
01:10:32,569 --> 01:10:37,849
I pushed everything from my mind and thought only about the
dragon from the stables.

1117
01:10:37,969 --> 01:10:44,049
It had been too dark to see what color it was, but I
remembered its glowing eyes and its razor-sharp teeth.

1118
01:10:44,089 --> 01:10:52,249
To bond with a creature like that, to share in its strengths and weaknesses, was hard to imagine, but I knew it was what
I wanted.

1119
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:58,569
By the time Master Pevus entered the room and called me to
the front, I had calmed my nerves and was ready for the
test.

1120
01:10:58,569 --> 01:11:00,249
He had called it Compassion.

1121
01:11:00,249 --> 01:11:05,249
While I didn’t know what the test would be like, I knew what
compassion was.

1122
01:11:05,249 --> 01:11:09,769
My mother had been the only person who didn’t look at me
differently after my hand had been crushed.

1123
01:11:09,769 --> 01:11:11,769
She’d shown me compassion every day.

1124
01:11:11,769 --> 01:11:14,769
I walked to the front and followed the master to the door.

1125
01:11:14,769 --> 01:11:21,409
Curate Anesko opened the door and I glanced back at Master
Pevus one last time.

1126
01:11:21,529 --> 01:11:27,609
His forehead was stooped with worry, but he’d looked like
that all day, so I didn’t let it bother me.

1127
01:11:27,649 --> 01:11:30,609
His eyes were a faded blue, almost gray.

1128
01:11:30,649 --> 01:11:35,489
He smiled at me, and I felt assurance in his expression.

1129
01:11:35,489 --> 01:11:39,369
I nodded at him, then looked at Anesko as I walked through
the doorway.

1130
01:11:39,449 --> 01:11:41,169
The Curate offered a single nod.

1131
01:11:41,209 --> 01:11:43,809
I bowed my head to him, then looked ahead.

1132
01:11:43,809 --> 01:11:49,969
The chamber looked like every other room of the Citadel with
its smooth stone walls and floor.

1133
01:11:49,969 --> 01:11:53,329
But when the door closed behind me, everything changed.

1134
01:11:53,329 --> 01:11:54,369
CHAPTER NINE

1135
01:11:54,449 --> 01:11:55,969
I was in Autumnwick’s market.

1136
01:11:55,969 --> 01:12:02,529
The Citadel towered behind me and I wondered if the magic of
the test had actually transported me here.

1137
01:12:02,529 --> 01:12:05,689
Everything was strikingly real, so it must have.

1138
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:10,649
It made sense, considering I hadn’t seen anyone come out of
the testing chamber.

1139
01:12:10,689 --> 01:12:14,889
I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to do, so I began to
explore the market.

1140
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:19,969
A young boy was standing beside one of the vendor stalls,
watching as people passed by.

1141
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:23,729
He was a low born with black hair and couldn’t be older than
eight years.

1142
01:12:23,769 --> 01:12:27,849
His face was dirty, and his clothes were in serious
disrepair.

1143
01:12:27,849 --> 01:12:30,649
As I walked by, he called out to me.

1144
01:12:30,649 --> 01:12:31,529
“Mister!

1145
01:12:31,529 --> 01:12:33,609
Do you have any coins to spare?”

1146
01:12:33,609 --> 01:12:38,489
Instinctively, I reached for my coin purse before
remembering that I had no money.

1147
01:12:38,529 --> 01:12:42,169
I patted the purse anyway, and I shook my head at the boy.

1148
01:12:42,209 --> 01:12:43,969
“Sorry, I don’t.”

1149
01:12:43,969 --> 01:12:49,169
The boy’s eyes gazed at me as if he was able to discern
whether I was being truthful or not.

1150
01:12:49,209 --> 01:12:51,889
He tilted his head to the side and smiled.

1151
01:12:51,929 --> 01:12:54,889
A few of his teeth were missing.

1152
01:12:54,889 --> 01:12:56,449
“That’s all right.

1153
01:12:56,449 --> 01:12:57,969
May your luck improve!”

1154
01:12:57,969 --> 01:12:59,809
“Yours, too,” I replied.

1155
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:04,289
I continued walking through the market and went down a row I
hadn’t seen the other day.

1156
01:13:04,329 --> 01:13:07,929
There were two people at a stall about mid-way down the
aisle.

1157
01:13:07,929 --> 01:13:12,049
They were having a heated discussion, and one of them was
waving their arms about wildly.

1158
01:13:12,049 --> 01:13:18,169
I thought about going down another row, but curiosity got
the better of me and I slowly got closer to them.

1159
01:13:18,169 --> 01:13:21,409
“I saw it first,” a woman said.

1160
01:13:21,409 --> 01:13:25,769
“Maybe, but I asked to buy it first,” the other woman
retorted.

1161
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:31,849
I glanced at the vendor, and he seemed content to let the
women verbally duel it out between themselves.

1162
01:13:31,849 --> 01:13:34,769
“It’s the last one, and I need it.”

1163
01:13:34,769 --> 01:13:38,689
I peered between the women and saw that they were arguing
over a slaughtered pig.

1164
01:13:38,769 --> 01:13:42,409
The amount of meat it would provide should have been
adequate for two families.

1165
01:13:42,489 --> 01:13:49,649
I held my tongue as I listened to their exchange, but then one of the women started to act like she was going to resort
to violence.

1166
01:13:49,649 --> 01:13:52,729
“You going to say something?” I asked the vendor.

1167
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:56,449
He glanced at me for a moment, then looked away and ignored
me.

1168
01:13:56,449 --> 01:13:58,809
“Ladies,” I interrupted.

1169
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,889
At first, they didn’t acknowledge me.

1170
01:14:00,889 --> 01:14:04,049
They kept yelling at one another and even started hurling
insults.

1171
01:14:04,089 --> 01:14:13,009
If someone didn’t do something quickly, I was certain the
two would end up hitting each other.

1172
01:14:13,009 --> 01:14:16,169
“Ladies,” I repeated, louder this time.

1173
01:14:16,209 --> 01:14:17,769
That got their attention.

1174
01:14:17,769 --> 01:14:21,570
“What do you want, boy?” It was the one who said she asked
to buy the pig first.

1175
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:24,170
“Isn’t that more than enough meat for one family?”

1176
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:28,410
The woman looked at the pig, then back at me. “And?”

1177
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:40,490
“Could you two not split the cost, then half the meat so that both of you get to enjoy it?” It seemed like common
sense to me, but the look on the woman’s face revealed that she hadn’t even considered the idea.

1178
01:14:40,530 --> 01:14:45,090
“I … I suppose,” she said, her anger quickly deflating.

1179
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:51,010
She looked back at the other woman and seemed embarrassed.
“That does sound like a good idea to me.

1180
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:52,370
What about you?”

1181
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:55,490
“Yes, I like that idea, too.”

1182
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:59,570
The first woman turned to the vendor and asked him to cut
the meat and divide it evenly.

1183
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:05,810
The vendor seemed disappointed that the situation had been
diffused, but he obliged her request anyway.

1184
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:12,690
Satisfied that I had helped, I was about to continue walking down the row when the first woman laid a hand on my
shoulder.

1185
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:15,330
I turned around and she held out a silver coin to me.

1186
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:19,730
“Please, take this,” she said. “As a sign of my
appreciation.”

1187
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:22,490
“I can’t accept that,” I said.

1188
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:26,090
The woman pressed the coin into my palm, ignoring my weak
protest.

1189
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:35,370
I tightened my grip on the coin and the woman offered me a smile and a single nod, then turned back to watch the vendor
cut the pig in half.

1190
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:36,890
I held the coin up.

1191
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:39,770
It flashed in the sunlight and appeared to be newly minted.

1192
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:42,770
The inscriptions on the coin’s surface weren’t familiar to
me.

1193
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:46,770
In fact, I was certain that the coin wasn’t even from our
kingdom.

1194
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:52,730
That didn’t mean it lacked value, so I put it into my coin
purse and continued down the rest of the row.

1195
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:57,530
There was nothing that caught my interest, so I headed back
to the front of the market where I had started.

1196
01:15:57,530 --> 01:16:03,170
I decided this wasn’t much of a test, especially since I
didn’t know what I should be doing.

1197
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:06,090
The boy begging for coins was still in the same spot.

1198
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:07,850
He looked at me and waved.

1199
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:09,730
And then an idea came to me.

1200
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:10,770
Compassion.

1201
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:15,370
What if I was meant to get the coin from the woman, only to
give it to the child?

1202
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:21,370
I walked over to the boy and knelt in front of him, then dug
the coin from my purse and held it out to him.

1203
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:23,730
“Here,” I said. “You need this more than I do.”

1204
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:27,530
The boy smirked, his eyes glittering with mischievousness.

1205
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:30,970
“I see your luck turned around quickly!” he said.

1206
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:32,050
“So it did.”

1207
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,050
“I don’t need your coin,” the boy said.

1208
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:34,730
“Oh.

1209
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:37,810
Well, I figured since you asked me earlier …”

1210
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:41,890
The boy was shaking his head before I could finish speaking.

1211
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,090
He pushed my hand away gently just as a tremor shook the
ground.

1212
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:51,570
The vibrations made my knees shake and I glanced around the
market to see if anyone else had noticed the disturbance.

1213
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:52,890
It was business as usual.

1214
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:57,050
When I looked at the boy again, his facial expression had
darkened.

1215
01:16:57,050 --> 01:17:00,770
He stepped closer to me and whispered harshly, “He’s
coming!”

1216
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:01,930
“Who is?” I asked.

1217
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:06,170
The boy grew fearful and he looked back and forth
frantically.

1218
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:08,410
It made me uneasy and I too looked around.

1219
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:10,610
I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary.

1220
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:17,090
People were making purchases and having conversations like
normal, so I was confused by the boy’s fear.

1221
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:19,010
“Who is coming?” I repeated.

1222
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:22,930
The boy’s small hands gripped my shirt and he stared into my
eyes.

1223
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:26,010
“The False King is coming,” he whispered harshly.

1224
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:27,170
“Who is that?”

1225
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:31,890
Dark clouds began to appear in the sky and thunder rumbled
in the distance.

1226
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:36,170
The storm was brewing quickly, much more quickly than seemed
normal.

1227
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:40,490
Within moments, the sun was blotted out and lightning
flickered among the clouds.

1228
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:44,570
Odder still, the boy’s eyes were glowing with a dull blue
light.

1229
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:48,530
I fell backward and scrambled away on my hands and feet.

1230
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:51,770
The boy turned to the storm clouds and raised his hands.

1231
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:57,010
Flames flickered to life on his fingertips, casting dancing
shadows around him.

1232
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,850
The storm clouds grew thicker and darker, sucking all light
into their black void.

1233
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:04,210
The people that had been in the market were gone.

1234
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:08,050
I realized that the buildings and tents were also gone.

1235
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:09,810
The market had simply vanished.

1236
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:12,050
It was only the boy and myself.

1237
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,330
And the figure in the storm.

1238
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:18,010
A lone form detached from the darkness and strode
purposefully toward the boy.

1239
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:25,730
The flames on the boy’s fingers arced high and formed a fiery pattern in the air, keeping the figure from getting
any closer.

1240
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:31,130
Even in the growing darkness, the boy’s magic glowed
brightly, defending us from the shadows.

1241
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:36,010
The figure struggled to get past the magical shield, but it
was too strong.

1242
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:37,650
I had no idea what was happening.

1243
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:39,130
Was this part of the test?

1244
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:41,450
What did any of this have to do with compassion?

1245
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:46,730
“I demand you leave!” the boy shouted at the figure. “You
are not welcome here!”

1246
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:49,570
“You can’t stop me forever,” the figure finally spoke.

1247
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:51,610
His voice made my flesh crawl.

1248
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:54,610
It was as if spiders were swarming along my skin.

1249
01:18:54,650 --> 01:19:01,130
A wave of panic spread throughout me when I saw the magical
barrier shudder and give way before the darkness.

1250
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:04,490
The boy screamed, and there was nothing but the darkness.

1251
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:08,090
I closed my eyes, preparing for my inevitable death.

1252
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:10,450
And then I heard a familiar voice.

1253
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,410
“Eldwin.”

1254
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:19,290
I looked up to see Master Pevus and Curate Anesko standing in a doorway that blended with the stone wall of the testing
chamber.

1255
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:22,610
“Is it over?” I asked. “Is the test done?”

1256
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:26,290
“It’s done,” Master Pevus said. “Come.”

1257
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:27,650
It was finally over.

1258
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:32,250
The strange boy, the magic, the dark figure that had snuffed
out the light.

1259
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,610
My heart still pounded heavily in my chest.

1260
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:41,530
The cold stones of the floor were comforting and I stayed
where I was for a long moment, then rose to my feet.

1261
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:46,370
It had all seemed so real and I had thought for sure that I
was really in the market, but no.

1262
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:48,170
I was in the chamber the entire time.

1263
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:50,290
That brought some relief to my anxiousness.

1264
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:52,810
It was all just part of the test.

1265
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:57,450
Curate Anesko was leading us through a hallway that curved
like a crescent.

1266
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:59,050
“Master?” I said.

1267
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:00,090
“Yes?”

1268
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:02,410
“In the test, there was a—”

1269
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:13,010
“Silence!” Master Pevus shouted. “I told you all that what
happens in the test is for the tested.”

1270
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,930
“Yes, but—”

1271
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:19,850
“No,” he interrupted again, his tone softer this time. “What
you saw was only for you.”

1272
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:21,850
I didn’t bother trying to ask again.

1273
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:25,530
For the rest of the walk, I replayed the test in my mind,
over and over.

1274
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:31,290
There was so much that didn’t make any sense to me, but
perhaps it wasn’t supposed to.

1275
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:35,770
Curate Anesko opened a door at the end of the hall on the
left and he motioned me inside.

1276
01:20:35,810 --> 01:20:39,810
I went in and saw all of the students who had already been
tested.

1277
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:42,810
I saw Maren and made my way to where she was sitting.

1278
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:44,770
“That was wild, wasn’t it?” she said.

1279
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:45,370
I nodded.

1280
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:46,970
“You all right?”

1281
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:49,330
“Yeah,” I answered softly, still burdened with my thoughts.

1282
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:52,890
I remembered the coin and reached into my purse.

1283
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:56,650
Cold metal touched my hand and I grabbed ahold of it and
drew it out.

1284
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:58,130
The coin was real.

1285
01:20:58,130 --> 01:20:58,970
CHAPTER TEN

1286
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:00,490
“Gods,” I breathed.

1287
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:04,010
“What?” Maren asked. “What is that?”

1288
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:09,330
“It’s from my te—” I caught myself and glanced around the
room to make sure no one had heard me.

1289
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:12,010
I lowered my voice and leaned closer to her.

1290
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,290
“It’s from my test,” I said. “A woman gave it to me.

1291
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:22,050
The test isn’t real, so how did this coin come back with
me?”

1292
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:35,130
“Now who’s breaking the rules?” Maren regarded me with a smirk, but seeing my seriousness, she went quiet and placed
her hand next to my ear and whispered, “What do you know about magic?”

1293
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:37,050
“Almost nothing,” I replied.

1294
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:40,650
“Meet me tonight after curfew and I’ll share some things
with you.”

1295
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:42,930
I would have argued with her about following the rules.

1296
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:45,490
Now, I was too curious to object.

1297
01:21:45,490 --> 01:21:52,170
I nodded at her, then turned my attention to the front of
the room as Master Pevus and the Curates entered.

1298
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:55,050
The multitude of conversations died abruptly.

1299
01:21:55,090 --> 01:22:04,210
“Thank you,” the master said. “Due to unforeseen circumstances, the last few potentials will not be able to
take their test in the chamber.

1300
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:13,571
For us to keep in line with the rules, they will be tested by the Curates in a series of exercises we employed in the
past before the chamber was built.”

1301
01:22:13,571 --> 01:22:21,771
Master Pevus paused briefly and I wondered if what happened in my test had anything to do with the sudden turn of
events.

1302
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:24,171
“Those of you who have already taken the assessment may go
to dinner.

1303
01:22:24,171 --> 01:22:25,811
Remember that you are not to discuss the details of your
trials with the other potentials.

1304
01:22:25,811 --> 01:22:31,051
Unless you have any questions for myself or the Curates, you
are dismissed.”

1305
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:34,571
Everyone stood and began to file out of the room.

1306
01:22:34,571 --> 01:22:39,611
Maren and I followed the others out of the chamber and made
our way to the dining hall.

1307
01:22:39,611 --> 01:22:43,931
The conversations were muted, and everyone seemed tired or
distracted.

1308
01:22:43,931 --> 01:22:48,771
The master hadn’t been kidding when he said the test would
push you in ways you didn’t think were possible.

1309
01:22:48,811 --> 01:22:54,531
I barely ate anything at all and ended up pushing the food
around on my plate more times than I could count.

1310
01:22:54,531 --> 01:23:00,451
The curfew bell was still a few hours away, so I took
advantage of the time and went to the infirmary to check on
Simon.

1311
01:23:00,491 --> 01:23:06,451
With the chaos of the day, I hadn’t devoted much time to
thinking about him and I was feeling guilty.

1312
01:23:06,451 --> 01:23:10,611
The healer who had helped me was there changing Simon’s
bandages when I arrived.

1313
01:23:10,651 --> 01:23:14,531
She glanced at me as I entered, but she didn’t say anything.

1314
01:23:14,651 --> 01:23:19,531
Once she was finished, she carried the dirty bandages away
and I stood beside Simon’s bed.

1315
01:23:19,531 --> 01:23:22,051
The clean wrappings were already stained with blood.

1316
01:23:22,051 --> 01:23:24,771
I frowned and looked at Simon’s face.

1317
01:23:24,771 --> 01:23:28,051
His eyes were closed, but they fluttered slightly.

1318
01:23:28,051 --> 01:23:32,771
“I don’t know if you can hear me,” I said softly, “but I
want to thank you for saving my life.

1319
01:23:32,771 --> 01:23:37,931
I know you were the cause of me getting into that situation
anyway, but you could have left me for dead.

1320
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:44,571
I know I wasn’t born into nobility like you, but I think all
life is valuable, regardless of your social status.

1321
01:23:44,571 --> 01:23:47,851
I’m hoping you pull through this injury and …” And what?

1322
01:23:47,851 --> 01:23:49,731
I felt like I was beginning to ramble.

1323
01:23:49,731 --> 01:23:53,971
“And, uh, maybe once you are healed, we might end up as
friends or something.

1324
01:23:54,011 --> 01:23:55,491
Thank you again, Simon.”

1325
01:23:55,491 --> 01:23:59,011
I turned and left the infirmary, then headed back to my room
to get some rest.

1326
01:23:59,011 --> 01:24:06,771
Considering I hadn’t slept the night before and the day had been full of stress, I was surprised I hadn’t passed out
from sheer exhaustion yet.

1327
01:24:06,771 --> 01:24:09,411
I pulled my boots off and collapsed into bed.

1328
01:24:09,451 --> 01:24:14,691
The next thing I knew, Maren was gently shaking my shoulder.

1329
01:24:14,731 --> 01:24:16,491
“Wake up,” she whispered.

1330
01:24:16,491 --> 01:24:19,731
Judging by the lack of light in the room, I figured it was
late.

1331
01:24:19,731 --> 01:24:22,011
I sat up and rubbed the sleep from my eyes.

1332
01:24:22,011 --> 01:24:25,171
“Sorry,” I mumbled. “I was supposed to meet you.”

1333
01:24:25,171 --> 01:24:31,811
“Don’t worry about it,” Maren replied. “We can talk here
since your roommate is in the infirmary.”

1334
01:24:31,811 --> 01:24:33,491
“Sure,” I said.

1335
01:24:33,491 --> 01:24:36,851
I cleared my throat and pushed myself back against the
headboard.

1336
01:24:36,891 --> 01:24:38,771
“Can I see that coin again?”

1337
01:24:38,771 --> 01:24:41,731
I fished it out of my coin purse and handed it to her.

1338
01:24:41,771 --> 01:24:46,851
Maren held it close to her face for a long moment, then
nodded and handed it back.

1339
01:24:46,851 --> 01:24:54,571
“You told me you don’t know much about magic,” she said. “Sorcerers are secretive in nature, so most people don’t
know anything about what they do.”

1340
01:24:54,611 --> 01:25:01,051
I was fully awake now, and my earlier suspicions about Maren
hiding something were at the forefront of my mind.

1341
01:25:01,051 --> 01:25:05,611
Before I could stop myself, I blurted out, “You’re hiding
something.”

1342
01:25:05,611 --> 01:25:06,971
“What do you mean?” she asked.

1343
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:12,571
Her facial expression was flawless, but the tone in her
voice let me know that I wasn’t wrong.

1344
01:25:12,611 --> 01:25:16,571
“You’re hiding something,” I repeated. “I think I know what
it is.

1345
01:25:16,571 --> 01:25:20,531
You don’t have to worry; I’m not going to share your
secret.”

1346
01:25:20,531 --> 01:25:28,411
She stared at me in silence and chewed her lower lip
nervously. “Yes, I have a secret,” she said. “I’m—”

1347
01:25:28,411 --> 01:25:31,411
“A sorcerer?” I interrupted. “I figured.

1348
01:25:31,411 --> 01:25:35,891
You were there in the alley when Jon and his guards attacked
me, weren’t you?”

1349
01:25:35,891 --> 01:25:40,771
Maren heaved a sigh and seemed relieved. “Yes, I was there.”

1350
01:25:40,771 --> 01:25:44,171
“Curate Anesko said they are looking for whoever cast that
spell.

1351
01:25:44,171 --> 01:25:45,771
He said it was powerful.”

1352
01:25:45,771 --> 01:25:49,971
“It wasn’t my best work,” she admitted. “I don’t know what
came over me.

1353
01:25:49,971 --> 01:25:52,971
I saw you in danger and just … acted.

1354
01:25:53,051 --> 01:25:54,971
I’m sorry I almost killed you.”

1355
01:25:54,971 --> 01:26:06,731
I swallowed hard and tried to act like it wasn’t a big deal, but I had just gained a healthy fear of her. “Thank you for
what you did.” I held the coin up. “Now tell me about this.

1356
01:26:06,731 --> 01:26:09,091
How did it come with me out of the test?”

1357
01:26:09,091 --> 01:26:12,331
“I’ll try to,” Maren replied. “Magic is like the wind.

1358
01:26:12,331 --> 01:26:14,451
You can’t see it, but you can feel it.

1359
01:26:14,451 --> 01:26:16,011
You know when it’s there.

1360
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:19,051
And like the wind, it chooses its own path.

1361
01:26:19,131 --> 01:26:21,931
Why did the magic of the chamber give you that coin?

1362
01:26:21,931 --> 01:26:23,331
I don’t know.

1363
01:26:23,331 --> 01:26:25,891
That doesn’t mean there isn’t a purpose, though.

1364
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:29,891
Even though most people don’t know much about magic, it is
inside all of us.

1365
01:26:29,971 --> 01:26:35,491
Not everyone can use it, but for some people, it just needs
to be awakened.”

1366
01:26:35,491 --> 01:26:40,411
“How do I find out what the purpose of the coin is?” I
asked, still trying to understand her explanation.

1367
01:26:40,451 --> 01:26:42,331
“You’ll have to figure that out for yourself.

1368
01:26:42,331 --> 01:26:47,371
Like the master said about the tests, it is different for
everyone.

1369
01:26:47,531 --> 01:26:49,531
Speaking of, how was your test?

1370
01:26:49,531 --> 01:26:52,531
You said a woman gave you that coin?”

1371
01:26:52,571 --> 01:26:58,131
I glanced at the open door, suddenly afraid that someone
might be listening to our conversation.

1372
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:01,371
Maren followed my gaze, then looked back at me.

1373
01:27:01,371 --> 01:27:03,731
“Did you hear something?” she asked.

1374
01:27:03,731 --> 01:27:06,771
“No,” I replied. “I guess I’m just nervous.

1375
01:27:06,771 --> 01:27:12,731
My test seemed fairly normal at first, but then it got
weird.”

1376
01:27:12,731 --> 01:27:16,411
“Weird?” Maren’s eyebrow rose. “What do you mean?”

1377
01:27:16,411 --> 01:27:19,971
“A storm came and a figure made of shadows stepped out of
the clouds.

1378
01:27:19,971 --> 01:27:22,651
He got into a magical battle with a small boy.”

1379
01:27:22,691 --> 01:27:27,371
“That is weird,” Maren said. “Do you remember anything
else?”

1380
01:27:27,371 --> 01:27:28,011
“Yeah.

1381
01:27:28,011 --> 01:27:30,451
The boy was young, and he seemed afraid of something.

1382
01:27:30,451 --> 01:27:32,091
He said someone was coming.”

1383
01:27:32,091 --> 01:27:32,931
“Who?”

1384
01:27:32,931 --> 01:27:34,171
I tried to remember what the boy said.

1385
01:27:34,251 --> 01:27:35,851
Was it something about a king?

1386
01:27:35,851 --> 01:27:40,171
I wracked my brain. “I can’t remember exactly.

1387
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:42,091
Some king, I think.”

1388
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:45,251
“A king is coming?” Maren asked. “But we have a king.

1389
01:27:45,251 --> 01:27:47,211
That doesn’t make any sense.”

1390
01:27:47,211 --> 01:27:48,571
“Tell me about it.

1391
01:27:48,571 --> 01:27:50,731
Nothing the boy said seemed to make any sense to me.

1392
01:27:50,731 --> 01:27:53,211
He was afraid of whoever it was, though.

1393
01:27:53,211 --> 01:27:57,651
And then he tried to keep the figure away with a spell that
created a wall or something.”

1394
01:27:57,651 --> 01:27:59,731
“This sounds vaguely familiar,” Maren said.

1395
01:27:59,731 --> 01:28:01,451
“It does?”

1396
01:28:01,451 --> 01:28:06,171
“Yes.” She nodded. “I heard something about it in my history
books.”

1397
01:28:06,171 --> 01:28:10,251
I closed my eyes and tried to remember the sequence of
events in the test.

1398
01:28:10,291 --> 01:28:12,411
The woman gave me the coin.

1399
01:28:12,411 --> 01:28:14,171
I tried to give it to the boy.

1400
01:28:14,531 --> 01:28:17,571
The storm came.

1401
01:28:17,571 --> 01:28:21,331
The boy said ‘he’s coming.’ My eyes snapped open.

1402
01:28:21,331 --> 01:28:22,531
“I remember now.

1403
01:28:22,531 --> 01:28:24,651
He said ‘the False King is coming.’”

1404
01:28:24,651 --> 01:28:27,531
The look on Maren’s face made the hairs on my arms raise.

1405
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:32,571
It was almost as if she was seeing a ghost behind me.

1406
01:28:32,611 --> 01:28:38,411
I ran my hands down my arms, pushing the hair down and
trying to ignore the odd feeling of dread in my stomach.

1407
01:28:38,491 --> 01:28:39,731
“What?”

1408
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:42,571
“Don’t you know who the False King is?” Maren asked.

1409
01:28:42,571 --> 01:28:45,171
“I don’t think so?”

1410
01:28:45,171 --> 01:28:46,371
“How do you not know, Eldwin?

1411
01:28:46,371 --> 01:28:48,971
The battle your father died in was against the False King.”

1412
01:28:48,971 --> 01:28:52,971
I’d honestly never heard the name before, but suddenly knowing that he was the cause of my father’s death made me
hate him, and I didn’t even know who he was.

1413
01:28:52,971 --> 01:28:53,291
“Who’s the False King?” I asked.

1414
01:28:53,291 --> 01:28:53,571
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1415
01:28:53,611 --> 01:28:55,371
Maren stared at me in disbelief.

1416
01:28:55,371 --> 01:29:01,891
“You really don’t know the story?” She sighed and shook her head. “It’s a long tale, but I’m not going to tell it to
you.

1417
01:29:01,931 --> 01:29:05,931
Do you know how to read?”

1418
01:29:05,931 --> 01:29:07,291
“Yes,” I said.

1419
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:07,491
“Good.

1420
01:29:07,491 --> 01:29:14,091
You should go to the library and find the books about him
and find out for yourself who he is.”

1421
01:29:14,091 --> 01:29:21,651
Obviously, I’d rather she just tell me, but considering I
had already learned how stubborn she could be, I conceded.

1422
01:29:21,691 --> 01:29:23,411
“That’s a good idea,” I said.

1423
01:29:23,411 --> 01:29:27,931
“Those are the only kind I have,” Maren said with a smirk.

1424
01:29:27,931 --> 01:29:32,731
I rolled my eyes. “You looked worried when I mentioned that
king,” I said.

1425
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:36,211
“Once you learn about him, you’ll understand why.

1426
01:29:36,211 --> 01:29:40,891
If the chamber was warning you about his return, I think you
should tell the master.”

1427
01:29:40,891 --> 01:29:46,011
“I tried to,” I said. “He wouldn’t let me say anything about
my test, though.”

1428
01:29:46,011 --> 01:29:50,331
Maren frowned. “Something is going on, but I’m not sure what
it could be.

1429
01:29:50,331 --> 01:29:52,771
Didn’t Master Pevus seem stressed all day?”

1430
01:29:52,811 --> 01:29:56,891
“Yeah,” I answered. “But I think it’s because he was dealing
with the testing.”

1431
01:29:56,891 --> 01:30:00,012
“Possibly, but we need to find out for sure.”

1432
01:30:00,012 --> 01:30:00,532
“We?

1433
01:30:00,532 --> 01:30:02,292
We don’t need to do anything, Maren.

1434
01:30:02,332 --> 01:30:06,492
You’ve got to stop breaking the rules or you’ll be kicked
out of the school.”

1435
01:30:06,492 --> 01:30:14,652
She continued talking as if I hadn’t said anything. “Master Pevus and the Curates hold a daily meeting early in the
morning, before the first bell.

1436
01:30:14,692 --> 01:30:17,972
I know a spot where we’ll be hidden but can hear
everything.”

1437
01:30:17,972 --> 01:30:19,332
“Maren, I told you—”

1438
01:30:19,332 --> 01:30:20,732
“Yes, yes.

1439
01:30:20,732 --> 01:30:23,452
You don’t want to be kicked out, I got it.

1440
01:30:23,452 --> 01:30:25,692
I’ll just go by myself, then.”

1441
01:30:25,692 --> 01:30:28,412
I knew I couldn’t let her do that, but I was afraid of
getting caught.

1442
01:30:28,412 --> 01:30:31,692
And I certainly wouldn’t want anyone reporting her to Curate
Anesko.

1443
01:30:31,732 --> 01:30:35,412
I heaved a sigh. “Where is this hidden spot?”

1444
01:30:35,412 --> 01:30:42,892
A few hours later, before the sun had yet to rise, Maren and I stood before a stone wall beside the school’s council
chamber.

1445
01:30:42,892 --> 01:30:46,132
She was slowly feeling along the stones, but I wasn’t sure
why.

1446
01:30:46,172 --> 01:30:51,972
As I was about to open my mouth to issue a complaint, she
stood up straight and said, “There!”

1447
01:30:51,972 --> 01:30:56,492
There was a grating noise, then a section of the wall pulled
back and slid to the side.

1448
01:30:56,492 --> 01:31:01,732
There was a small room, roughly large enough to hold about
five or six people.

1449
01:31:01,732 --> 01:31:06,412
Maren ushered me inside and the wall glided back into place
behind us.

1450
01:31:06,452 --> 01:31:08,452
“What is this place?” I asked.

1451
01:31:08,452 --> 01:31:11,652
Maren clamped a hand over my mouth. “Ssh!

1452
01:31:11,652 --> 01:31:16,772
You have to be quiet in here or they’ll hear you,” she
furiously whispered.

1453
01:31:16,772 --> 01:31:18,372
“Sorry,” I mouthed.

1454
01:31:18,372 --> 01:31:20,692
“They’re already talking,” she said.

1455
01:31:20,692 --> 01:31:23,172
Maren knelt and motioned me to do the same.

1456
01:31:23,172 --> 01:31:25,572
I obeyed and sat on the floor beside her.

1457
01:31:25,572 --> 01:31:28,972
She pointed at the wall and leaned closer to it.

1458
01:31:28,972 --> 01:31:32,092
I didn’t know what she was doing, but I mimicked her.

1459
01:31:32,092 --> 01:31:37,252
To my surprise, I was able to see through part of the wall
and into the council room.

1460
01:31:37,252 --> 01:31:39,892
“I saw it as well,” Curate Anesko said.

1461
01:31:39,932 --> 01:31:43,692
“We all saw it,” Master Pevus replied.

1462
01:31:43,692 --> 01:31:47,212
He looked more haggard than he had earlier if that were
possible.

1463
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:51,332
“Yes, but what does it mean?” another Curate asked.

1464
01:31:51,332 --> 01:31:54,012
I was fairly certain her name was Josephine.

1465
01:31:54,012 --> 01:32:01,412
“I’m not sure,” the master said. “The magic was warning us,
but I don’t see how the False King could still be alive.

1466
01:32:01,412 --> 01:32:03,292
He and Matthias fell in battle.

1467
01:32:03,292 --> 01:32:04,572
I was there.”

1468
01:32:04,572 --> 01:32:06,972
“They’re talking about your test,” Maren murmured.

1469
01:32:06,972 --> 01:32:08,812
I thought so, too.

1470
01:32:08,892 --> 01:32:14,532
“Perhaps sending a scout or two to check things out would do
well to ease our fears?” Anesko suggested.

1471
01:32:14,532 --> 01:32:20,172
“That’s a good idea,” Master Pevus said. “Send two dragoons
who ride blues.

1472
01:32:20,172 --> 01:32:24,492
Their speed will get them there and back within a few days.”

1473
01:32:24,492 --> 01:32:28,892
“Let’s hope that we’re just seeing monsters in the dark that
aren’t truly there,” Josephine said.

1474
01:32:28,892 --> 01:32:30,892
“Yes, let us hope so.”

1475
01:32:30,892 --> 01:32:38,612
There was silence for a moment, then Master Pevus changed
the subject. “What of the manual testing?

1476
01:32:38,652 --> 01:32:40,332
How did that go?”

1477
01:32:40,372 --> 01:32:47,132
“Very well, considering we’ve not done it in my lifetime,” Anesko replied. “They both passed, according to the
documents.”

1478
01:32:47,172 --> 01:32:48,372
“That is good news.

1479
01:32:48,372 --> 01:32:54,652
Based on the chamber tests, are we all in agreement on those
who passed and those who failed?”

1480
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:58,972
The Curates all spoke at once, but the consensus seemed to
be agreement.

1481
01:32:58,972 --> 01:33:01,652
I wondered who had failed.

1482
01:33:01,652 --> 01:33:02,932
Was I one of them?

1483
01:33:02,932 --> 01:33:06,212
My stomach churned with anxiety.

1484
01:33:06,212 --> 01:33:15,972
“There is one final matter to discuss before we dismiss.” The master leaned back in his chair and rubbed his eyes
while stifling a yawn. “The girl.”

1485
01:33:15,972 --> 01:33:16,932
The room went quiet.

1486
01:33:16,932 --> 01:33:21,372
I glanced at Maren, but she kept her eyes on Master Pevus.

1487
01:33:21,412 --> 01:33:28,452
“Her identity is unknown to the others,” Anesko said. “I’ve
listened to the conversations all day.

1488
01:33:28,452 --> 01:33:30,212
No one is talking about her.”

1489
01:33:30,212 --> 01:33:36,452
“It’s bound to come out sooner or later,” the master said. “I’m not worried about that, but I am concerned about her
safety.

1490
01:33:36,532 --> 01:33:41,052
If something happens to her …” he let the words hang in the
air.

1491
01:33:41,052 --> 01:33:43,852
The Curates glanced at one another, but no one spoke.

1492
01:33:43,892 --> 01:33:48,452
“She knew the risks in coming here,” Anesko said. “The power
she has doesn’t change that.

1493
01:33:48,452 --> 01:33:52,532
And it doesn’t change how she is tested, either.”

1494
01:33:52,772 --> 01:33:59,572
“I agree,” Master Pevus said. “Her father is the one that
poses the most problematic if something goes wrong.

1495
01:33:59,572 --> 01:34:04,052
From the reports I’ve received, he doesn’t even know she’s
gone.”

1496
01:34:04,092 --> 01:34:11,732
“Then we feign ignorance if he finds out she’s missing and
that she’s here,” Anesko said. “Politics have no place
here.”

1497
01:34:11,732 --> 01:34:15,772
The master laughed. “You still have much to learn if you
believe that.”

1498
01:34:15,772 --> 01:34:20,532
Anesko folded his arms. “Our task is to train dragon riders.

1499
01:34:20,532 --> 01:34:25,652
So long as we are doing that, I don’t see what her father
would take issue with.”

1500
01:34:25,652 --> 01:34:31,972
“I don’t disagree with that,” Master Pevus replied.
“Regardless, we all need to agree with her presence here.”

1501
01:34:31,972 --> 01:34:34,972
“I see nothing wrong with it,” Josephine said.

1502
01:34:34,972 --> 01:34:36,852
“Neither do I,” Anesko added.

1503
01:34:36,852 --> 01:34:39,812
The other Curates agreed and Master Pevus stood up.

1504
01:34:39,812 --> 01:34:41,332
“It’s decided, then.

1505
01:34:41,332 --> 01:34:43,692
She stays and will take the tests like any other potential.

1506
01:34:43,692 --> 01:34:47,452
If her father becomes a problem, I will deal with him.”

1507
01:34:47,452 --> 01:34:50,852
That last part didn’t sound threatening, but more a
statement of fact.

1508
01:34:50,892 --> 01:34:53,172
I wasn’t sure who they were talking about.

1509
01:34:53,172 --> 01:34:59,012
My first thought was Maren, but the only thing different
about her than everyone else was that she was a sorcerer.

1510
01:34:59,012 --> 01:35:06,412
Maybe her father was also a sorcerer, a powerful one, and they feared his anger if he found out she was here without
permission?

1511
01:35:06,452 --> 01:35:10,572
“The council is dismissed,” Master Pevus said.

1512
01:35:10,572 --> 01:35:17,532
Maren and I waited until the room was empty and we didn’t
hear anyone in the hallway before exiting the hidden
chamber.

1513
01:35:17,532 --> 01:35:20,172
“Who do you think they were talking about?” I asked.

1514
01:35:20,172 --> 01:35:29,972
“We didn’t learn anything we didn’t already know,” Maren huffed in disappointment. “Maybe their scouts will bring
back some news that confirms the return of the False King.”

1515
01:35:29,972 --> 01:35:34,052
“Based on what I’ve heard so far, I hope he’s not back.”

1516
01:35:34,092 --> 01:35:37,492
“That’s something I think everyone would agree with,” Maren
replied.

1517
01:35:37,492 --> 01:35:40,852
We parted ways at the end of the hall, and I headed back to
my room.

1518
01:35:40,852 --> 01:35:45,772
It was still early, and the first bell hadn’t rung yet, so I
didn’t pass anyone else on my way.

1519
01:35:45,772 --> 01:35:51,452
There was so much going on already and I had only been at
the school for a few days.

1520
01:35:51,492 --> 01:35:56,092
It seemed that more mysteries developed by the moment, and
there were more questions than answers.

1521
01:35:56,092 --> 01:36:01,412
I made it to my room and paced back and forth, replaying the
council meeting over in my mind.

1522
01:36:01,412 --> 01:36:04,892
The magic of the testing chamber had spoken to me, that was
clear.

1523
01:36:04,892 --> 01:36:06,732
And it had given me the coin.

1524
01:36:06,732 --> 01:36:09,852
I retrieved it and held it up, staring at its engraving.

1525
01:36:10,132 --> 01:36:20,212
Maren had said that magic was like the wind and none knew its course, so how was I supposed to know what the coin was
for?

1526
01:36:20,252 --> 01:36:22,412
“What is your secret?” I whispered.

1527
01:36:22,412 --> 01:36:25,172
The coin remained silent, as I expected.

1528
01:36:25,172 --> 01:36:28,892
If it had replied, I would likely have woken the entire
school by screaming.

1529
01:36:28,892 --> 01:36:31,692
I put the coin back in my purse and put on my robes.

1530
01:36:31,732 --> 01:36:35,772
I yawned and considered how messed up my sleeping schedule
had become.

1531
01:36:35,812 --> 01:36:37,932
Hopefully, it would get back to normal soon.

1532
01:36:37,972 --> 01:36:42,772
I needed to find some time to get to the library and read
about the False King.

1533
01:36:42,772 --> 01:36:48,132
Maren had given me almost no information, and my curiosity
was rising like a wave.

1534
01:36:48,132 --> 01:36:54,932
As impatient as I was, the time passed quickly and the first
bell clanged, signaling it was time to wake up.

1535
01:36:54,932 --> 01:37:00,292
I joined my fellow students at the bottom of the stairway,
and we found Curate Anesko waiting for us.

1536
01:37:00,372 --> 01:37:02,372
“Good morning,” he greeted.

1537
01:37:02,412 --> 01:37:05,612
“Good morning, Curate,” we sounded off.

1538
01:37:05,612 --> 01:37:09,052
“This year’s potentials are having an easy beginning.

1539
01:37:09,052 --> 01:37:13,132
The master has declared today a free day, but do not get
lax.

1540
01:37:13,172 --> 01:37:17,212
Tomorrow the testing resumes, and it will be an interesting
time.

1541
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:21,732
Remember the rules you agreed to and stay away from the
dragon stables.”

1542
01:37:21,732 --> 01:37:25,092
The Curate left and the other potentials scattered
throughout the Citadel.

1543
01:37:25,092 --> 01:37:27,532
It was time to find out who the False King was.

1544
01:37:27,572 --> 01:37:28,572
CHAPTER TWELVE

1545
01:37:28,652 --> 01:37:31,732
The library was located at the far north end of the Citadel.

1546
01:37:31,732 --> 01:37:39,932
Maren had given me directions during breakfast and I only got turned around twice before reaching the wooden doors
that marked the entrance.

1547
01:37:39,932 --> 01:37:45,092
I stepped inside and was surprised to find that the place
was immaculate.

1548
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:48,933
Hundreds, if not thousands, of bookstands were lined in
orderly rows.

1549
01:37:48,933 --> 01:37:55,373
There were several tables and chairs near the windows, where
natural light slanted in through the glass panes.

1550
01:37:55,373 --> 01:38:00,333
A few students were sitting at some of the tables, large
tomes opened in front of them.

1551
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:04,333
The most notable thing about the library was the silence.

1552
01:38:04,333 --> 01:38:07,213
A robed woman sat behind a large desk.

1553
01:38:07,213 --> 01:38:10,893
She was slowly flipping pages of a book as I walked up.

1554
01:38:10,893 --> 01:38:13,173
She paused and looked up at me.

1555
01:38:13,173 --> 01:38:15,773
I remembered her from my first day.

1556
01:38:15,773 --> 01:38:18,053
“Surrel,” I said, smiling at her.

1557
01:38:18,093 --> 01:38:23,013
“Son of Matthias,” she replied. “How are you finding the
school so far?”

1558
01:38:23,013 --> 01:38:26,333
“It’s different from what I’m used to, but in a good way.”

1559
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:28,053
“That’s good to hear.

1560
01:38:28,053 --> 01:38:32,133
I’ve been a student for almost a year and I can’t say I’ve
had a bad experience yet.

1561
01:38:32,133 --> 01:38:34,173
How about your testing?”

1562
01:38:34,213 --> 01:38:39,653
“I’m not sure,” I admitted. “I think I did well with
Compassion, but we haven’t heard our results yet.”

1563
01:38:39,653 --> 01:38:46,813
“No news is good news, as they say,” Surrel said. “Normally,
the tests are done over three straight days.

1564
01:38:46,813 --> 01:38:52,293
I’ve heard there have been some complications, and the
testing has been pushed back?”

1565
01:38:52,293 --> 01:38:55,613
I nodded. “Yes, our next test will be tomorrow.”

1566
01:38:55,613 --> 01:38:57,573
“Well, I wish you luck.

1567
01:38:57,573 --> 01:38:59,133
Have you been to the library yet?”

1568
01:38:59,133 --> 01:39:00,853
“No,” I said.

1569
01:39:00,853 --> 01:39:01,933
“I think you’ll like it.

1570
01:39:01,933 --> 01:39:12,253
We’ve got the largest collection of books in the entire kingdom,” Surrel said proudly. “If you are looking for books
on a specific topic, you can search the index for book locations.

1571
01:39:12,253 --> 01:39:14,293
Here, let me show you.”

1572
01:39:14,293 --> 01:39:16,333
Surrel stood and walked around the desk.

1573
01:39:16,373 --> 01:39:19,653
I followed her to a cabinet with hundreds of small drawers.

1574
01:39:19,653 --> 01:39:24,133
Each drawer was labeled with a metal plaque inscribed with
letters.

1575
01:39:24,293 --> 01:39:27,053
“Everything is arranged in alphabetical order.

1576
01:39:27,093 --> 01:39:32,333
So, if you are looking for a book on felines, you will open
the drawer that has ‘FE’ on it.

1577
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:38,053
Then you’ll flip through the parchments until you find the
word you are looking for.

1578
01:39:38,053 --> 01:39:39,893
Don’t remove it from the order it’s in.

1579
01:39:39,893 --> 01:39:42,373
If you do, the Librarian will have a fit.”

1580
01:39:42,373 --> 01:39:49,653
To show what she meant, Surrel found the parchment labeled
feline and lifted it, but not completely out of the drawer.

1581
01:39:49,693 --> 01:40:00,373
“Listed on the parchment will be the locations of any book that covers the topic.” She pointed to the writing. “R Six-C
Three-S Two is the location of a book.”

1582
01:40:00,373 --> 01:40:05,133
“Am I supposed to memorize that since I can’t take the
parchment out?”

1583
01:40:05,133 --> 01:40:07,253
Surrel giggled. “No, of course not.

1584
01:40:07,253 --> 01:40:11,653
We have blank parchments, quills, and ink wells available
for use.

1585
01:40:11,653 --> 01:40:17,893
You’ll just write down the locations, then take your
parchment with you to find the books.”

1586
01:40:17,893 --> 01:40:20,813
“I can take books from the shelf?” I asked.

1587
01:40:20,813 --> 01:40:23,253
“Yes, so long as they are not chained to the shelf.

1588
01:40:23,253 --> 01:40:26,213
If they are chained, you’ll have to read the book there.

1589
01:40:26,253 --> 01:40:29,173
Chained books are too valuable to be removed.”

1590
01:40:29,213 --> 01:40:31,693
“Do I have to put the books back when I’m done?”

1591
01:40:31,693 --> 01:40:46,373
“We prefer that you didn’t,” Surrel said. “Just leave the books on the table when you are done and we will ensure they
get put back in their proper place.” Surrel looked past me to a student who was standing at her desk. “Feel free to start looking through the library.

1592
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:52,613
If you need anything, you can find me at the desk there
unless I’m helping someone find something.”

1593
01:40:52,613 --> 01:40:54,453
“Thank you, Surrel.

1594
01:40:54,493 --> 01:40:56,413
You’ve been very helpful.”

1595
01:40:56,413 --> 01:40:58,693
She smiled and walked away.

1596
01:40:58,693 --> 01:41:04,413
I looked at the vast number of drawers and was glad that my
mother had taught me to read and write when I was younger.

1597
01:41:04,413 --> 01:41:11,053
I found the drawer marked with FA and flipped through the
parchments until I found what I was looking for.

1598
01:41:11,093 --> 01:41:12,413
False King.

1599
01:41:12,413 --> 01:41:22,013
I retrieved a blank parchment and dipped a quill into an ink well, then took them back to the cabinet and wrote down the
first three locations of books.

1600
01:41:22,053 --> 01:41:25,653
I closed the drawer and walked along the shelves, completely
confused.

1601
01:41:25,693 --> 01:41:30,133
I had no idea what the locations meant, and there were no
obvious markings on the bookstands.

1602
01:41:30,133 --> 01:41:35,133
After several frustrating moments, I gave up and went to get
help from Surrel.

1603
01:41:35,133 --> 01:41:36,893
She was sitting at her desk scribbling notes.

1604
01:41:36,893 --> 01:41:38,453
She looked up as I approached.

1605
01:41:38,453 --> 01:41:46,533
“I’m sorry for interrupting you,” I said, “but I can’t seem
to figure out how to find these locations.”

1606
01:41:46,533 --> 01:41:47,173
“Oh!

1607
01:41:47,173 --> 01:41:53,693
I apologize!” She said loudly, then quickly lowered her
voice in embarrassment. “I forgot to explain the locations.

1608
01:41:53,733 --> 01:41:55,813
Let me see your parchment.”

1609
01:41:55,813 --> 01:42:05,133
I handed it to her and she pointed to the first one. “The
first set of letters and numbers is the row number.

1610
01:42:05,133 --> 01:42:09,773
You can find the row numbers at the top of the bookstand, on
the upper left-hand corner.

1611
01:42:09,773 --> 01:42:12,813
So, ‘R sixteen’ stands for Row Sixteen.

1612
01:42:12,813 --> 01:42:16,653
The second set is the case number, which is the section.

1613
01:42:16,693 --> 01:42:19,893
So ‘C twelve’ stands for Case Twelve.

1614
01:42:20,013 --> 01:42:24,133
And the final number is the shelf position on that case.”

1615
01:42:24,133 --> 01:42:26,213
“Now that you’ve explained it, it makes sense.

1616
01:42:26,253 --> 01:42:29,053
I don’t know how I didn’t figure that out on my own.”

1617
01:42:29,053 --> 01:42:33,733
“Don’t worry about it,” Surrel said. “Most of us never
figured it out on our own.”

1618
01:42:33,733 --> 01:42:37,173
“Thank you again,” I said.

1619
01:42:37,173 --> 01:42:40,293
Armed with new information, I easily found the first
location.

1620
01:42:40,293 --> 01:42:44,693
The shelf contained about fifty books, but none of them were
about the False King.

1621
01:42:44,933 --> 01:42:50,493
Assuming someone already had that book, I went to the second
location on my parchment but found the same problem.

1622
01:42:50,533 --> 01:42:52,933
The third location was also lacking the book I needed.

1623
01:42:52,973 --> 01:42:58,493
I scratched my chin and headed back to the cabinet to find
more locations.

1624
01:42:58,533 --> 01:43:02,053
I wrote down three more, then searched those locations.

1625
01:43:02,053 --> 01:43:05,813
Again, each shelf was lacking anything about the False King.

1626
01:43:05,853 --> 01:43:08,693
Growing frustrated, I went back to Surrel’s desk.

1627
01:43:08,693 --> 01:43:11,613
She was absent, so I waited for her to come back.

1628
01:43:11,613 --> 01:43:14,413
A short moment later, she returned.

1629
01:43:14,413 --> 01:43:21,813
“I’m not sure if I’m looking incorrectly, but I don’t see the books I’m looking for in these locations.” I held out
the parchment to Surrel.

1630
01:43:21,813 --> 01:43:25,933
She took it and looked at, then motioned for me to follow
her.

1631
01:43:25,933 --> 01:43:31,373
I was worried I had searched erroneously and she was going
to make me look like a fool.

1632
01:43:31,373 --> 01:43:35,493
However, she went to the same location I had and perused the
books on the shelf.

1633
01:43:35,493 --> 01:43:37,733
“Someone may have this book,” she said softly.

1634
01:43:37,733 --> 01:43:45,293
“That’s what I thought,” I replied. “Yet I looked for six
different books and none of them are here.”

1635
01:43:45,293 --> 01:43:49,493
“That is a little odd, though someone may be researching the
topic.

1636
01:43:49,493 --> 01:43:54,053
Let’s check a few of the other locations.”

1637
01:43:54,053 --> 01:43:58,813
Surrel and I went back to the cabinet, and she wrote down a
few more locations.

1638
01:43:58,813 --> 01:44:01,493
Her handwriting was much smoother than mine.

1639
01:44:01,493 --> 01:44:06,253
She led the way to the various locations, and each time we
encountered the same thing.

1640
01:44:06,253 --> 01:44:08,613
She seemed to be growing frustrated.

1641
01:44:08,653 --> 01:44:11,053
“Let’s go to the chained books,” she suggested.

1642
01:44:11,053 --> 01:44:15,613
The rows of bookstands with chained books took up much less
space in the library than the regular books.

1643
01:44:15,613 --> 01:44:18,613
We went to the location and Surrel frowned.

1644
01:44:18,613 --> 01:44:21,133
“Now this is odd,” she muttered.

1645
01:44:21,133 --> 01:44:23,093
She pushed a few of the books apart.

1646
01:44:23,133 --> 01:44:25,973
Hidden behind the books was a piece of a broken chain.

1647
01:44:26,013 --> 01:44:30,053
A gasp escaped Surrel and she looked at me, her eyes wide.

1648
01:44:30,053 --> 01:44:35,373
“This is bad,” she whispered. “Very bad.

1649
01:44:35,373 --> 01:44:39,653
The Librarian is going to be furious that someone took a
chained book.”

1650
01:44:39,653 --> 01:44:48,053
I was less concerned about that than she was and more concerned that every book on the False King was inexplicably
missing from the library.

1651
01:44:48,053 --> 01:44:53,933
Surrel left me to find the Librarian, and I checked a few
other locations with no luck.

1652
01:44:53,933 --> 01:44:59,213
Giving up, I left the library and wandered around the
Citadel, letting my thoughts drift.

1653
01:44:59,213 --> 01:45:04,053
Maren knew about the False King, so I started looking for
her.

1654
01:45:04,093 --> 01:45:09,013
I had a feeling she was down in the dragon stables, and I
wasn’t going down there.

1655
01:45:09,013 --> 01:45:12,533
The seventh bell rang and I went to the dining hall for
lunch.

1656
01:45:12,573 --> 01:45:15,013
Maren was there eating at a table by herself.

1657
01:45:15,013 --> 01:45:18,653
I filled a tray of food and joined her.

1658
01:45:18,653 --> 01:45:21,733
“You’ll never believe what happened in the library,” I said.

1659
01:45:21,733 --> 01:45:25,933
“What?” Maren asked with a mouth full of partially chewed
food.

1660
01:45:25,933 --> 01:45:28,173
“All of the books on the False King are missing.

1661
01:45:28,173 --> 01:45:30,773
Even the chained books.”

1662
01:45:30,773 --> 01:45:34,093
Maren stopped chewing and stared at me. “Are you serious?”

1663
01:45:34,093 --> 01:45:34,853
“Yes.

1664
01:45:34,853 --> 01:45:36,173
Surrel even looked with me.

1665
01:45:36,173 --> 01:45:40,974
She said the Librarian is going to be upset that someone
broke the chains.”

1666
01:45:41,174 --> 01:45:46,614
“Eldwin,” Maren whispered. “Someone stole those books, I’m
sure of it.”

1667
01:45:46,734 --> 01:45:48,254
“That’s what I figured,” I replied.

1668
01:45:48,254 --> 01:45:51,654
“There’s only one reason someone would take them.”

1669
01:45:51,654 --> 01:45:53,254
“Why is that?” I asked.

1670
01:45:53,254 --> 01:45:55,934
“Someone is trying to hide something.”

1671
01:45:55,934 --> 01:45:56,974
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1672
01:45:56,974 --> 01:46:00,454
“Who would be trying to hide something related to the False
King?” I asked.

1673
01:46:00,454 --> 01:46:05,374
“One of his servants, obviously,” Maren replied. “There must
be a servant here in the Citadel.

1674
01:46:05,374 --> 01:46:08,854
A spy relaying information back to the False King.”

1675
01:46:08,894 --> 01:46:11,614
“We don’t even know if the False King is back,” I pointed
out.

1676
01:46:11,614 --> 01:46:14,774
“Always assume your enemy is two steps ahead of you.”

1677
01:46:14,774 --> 01:46:16,534
I was familiar with the saying.

1678
01:46:16,534 --> 01:46:19,174
My father said it a lot when I was younger.

1679
01:46:19,174 --> 01:46:22,214
I never understood it back then, but I did now.

1680
01:46:22,254 --> 01:46:26,094
Maren lowered her voice. “I bet it’s one of the Curates.”

1681
01:46:26,094 --> 01:46:28,814
“Why would you think that?” I asked.

1682
01:46:28,854 --> 01:46:33,774
“Well, it could be Master Pevus, but I don’t think he’d be
so stressed if he were the False King’s agent.

1683
01:46:33,814 --> 01:46:35,854
So that leaves the Curates.

1684
01:46:35,854 --> 01:46:37,054
Think about it.

1685
01:46:37,094 --> 01:46:41,774
They have access to almost everything in the Citadel, and
they are in the council meetings.

1686
01:46:41,774 --> 01:46:45,134
That makes them privy to a lot of information.”

1687
01:46:45,134 --> 01:46:50,494
I didn’t want to admit it, but she had a point. “Let the
master know what you think and see what he says.”

1688
01:46:50,494 --> 01:46:53,734
Maren was shaking her head before I finished speaking. “No.

1689
01:46:53,734 --> 01:46:59,334
I’ll need more than just my theory to sway Master Pevus into
believing that one of his trusted people is a spy.

1690
01:46:59,334 --> 01:47:00,574
I’ll need proof.”

1691
01:47:00,574 --> 01:47:03,014
I knew where she was going and sighed.

1692
01:47:03,014 --> 01:47:06,094
“We need to follow the Curates around and see what we can
find.”

1693
01:47:06,134 --> 01:47:09,094
“You do know that none of this is your responsibility,
right?

1694
01:47:09,094 --> 01:47:12,454
It’s not your job to find a spy if there even is one.”

1695
01:47:12,534 --> 01:47:18,374
Maren stated at me in silence and judging by the look on her
face, it seemed I had hurt her feelings somehow.

1696
01:47:18,414 --> 01:47:22,694
The look quickly disappeared and was replaced by her
customary stubbornness.

1697
01:47:22,734 --> 01:47:27,494
“If you don’t want to help find who is trying to help the
False King, that’s fine.

1698
01:47:27,494 --> 01:47:32,854
I can do it alone.” She stood up and left the table, leaving
her tray of food mostly uneaten.

1699
01:47:32,854 --> 01:47:38,854
I shoved a roll into my mouth and hurried after her, chewing
furiously.

1700
01:47:38,894 --> 01:47:44,894
“I do want to help,” I said. “I’m just not sure how well
this will go if we get caught by the spy.”

1701
01:47:44,894 --> 01:47:46,414
“What do you mean?” Maren asked.

1702
01:47:46,414 --> 01:47:52,574
“Well, I would assume that if the False King put a spy here,
they would powerful.”

1703
01:47:52,614 --> 01:47:53,734
“Of course.”

1704
01:47:54,014 --> 01:47:55,534
“And we’re barely initiates,” I added.

1705
01:47:55,534 --> 01:47:57,694
“Did you forget that I’m a sorcerer?”

1706
01:47:57,694 --> 01:48:01,934
“No,” I said. “But have you ever fought another sorcerer?”

1707
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:04,934
Maren’s silence gave me the answer I needed.

1708
01:48:04,934 --> 01:48:11,614
“I’m not planning on confronting them myself,” she said. “I
just need proof that I can take to Master Pevus.”

1709
01:48:11,614 --> 01:48:19,254
This plan didn’t seem very thought out, but for some
inexplicable reason, I continued to follow Maren toward
trouble.

1710
01:48:19,254 --> 01:48:24,534
It turned out that there were many hidden rooms like the one
we’d hidden in when we listened to the council meeting.

1711
01:48:24,574 --> 01:48:30,694
The fact that Maren had memorized their locations after
seeing a map of the school was beyond impressive.

1712
01:48:30,694 --> 01:48:35,614
Maybe sorcerers were gifted with better minds than those of
us who weren’t magically inclined?

1713
01:48:35,654 --> 01:48:39,494
We snuck into Curate Anesko’s room and Maren opened the door
to the hidden room.

1714
01:48:39,494 --> 01:48:45,934
It was about the same size as the first one, but we weren’t
forced to sit down to see into the Curate’s chambers.

1715
01:48:45,974 --> 01:48:50,654
After an hour of sitting idly, Anesko entered the room and
sat at his desk.

1716
01:48:50,654 --> 01:48:55,774
He flipped through a stack of books and scattered parchments
around as he scratched notes.

1717
01:48:55,814 --> 01:49:00,094
I assumed he was studying or something, but he certainly
wasn’t doing anything suspicious.

1718
01:49:00,094 --> 01:49:02,174
The small room was warm and cozy.

1719
01:49:02,174 --> 01:49:08,294
I must have dozed off, because the next thing I knew, Maren
was jabbing me with her elbow.

1720
01:49:08,294 --> 01:49:10,694
“What is it?” I asked.

1721
01:49:10,694 --> 01:49:12,414
I saw that Anesko was gone.

1722
01:49:12,414 --> 01:49:17,494
“You were snoring,” she complained. “You’re lucky Anesko
left before you got too loud.”

1723
01:49:17,494 --> 01:49:21,094
“Sorry,” I said, shrugging.

1724
01:49:21,094 --> 01:49:23,374
“Let’s get out of here before he comes back.”

1725
01:49:23,374 --> 01:49:28,614
We left and navigated our way through the maze of hallways
until we reached an area I didn’t recognize.

1726
01:49:28,614 --> 01:49:30,214
“Where are we?” I asked.

1727
01:49:30,214 --> 01:49:38,374
“This is the hall for female Curates,” Maren said. “The
chambers are on opposite sides of the Citadel.”

1728
01:49:38,374 --> 01:49:41,974
Maren paused outside the first door on the left side of the
hall.

1729
01:49:41,974 --> 01:49:43,894
“Whose room is this?” I asked.

1730
01:49:43,894 --> 01:49:45,534
“Curate Josphine’s.”

1731
01:49:45,574 --> 01:49:49,814
After having listened to the council meeting earlier, I
didn’t think Josephine would be a spy.

1732
01:49:49,814 --> 01:49:51,374
She was too nice to be evil.

1733
01:49:51,414 --> 01:49:54,134
I didn’t bother voicing my opinion to Maren.

1734
01:49:54,174 --> 01:49:56,974
She would refuse to listen until she saw it for herself.

1735
01:49:56,974 --> 01:49:59,414
Maren knocked gently on the door.

1736
01:49:59,414 --> 01:50:00,574
There was no answer.

1737
01:50:00,574 --> 01:50:03,214
She waited a moment, then pushed the door open.

1738
01:50:03,214 --> 01:50:05,334
Its hinges creaked softly.

1739
01:50:05,374 --> 01:50:06,894
I let Maren go in first.

1740
01:50:06,894 --> 01:50:09,454
She looked around and waved me in.

1741
01:50:09,454 --> 01:50:12,374
Josephine’s room was much different than Anesko’s.

1742
01:50:12,374 --> 01:50:14,734
There were no windows and no candles.

1743
01:50:14,734 --> 01:50:17,814
Instead, a ball of light hovered near the ceiling.

1744
01:50:17,814 --> 01:50:26,094
It bobbed up and down a few inches, causing shadows to
flutter back and forth across the room.

1745
01:50:26,134 --> 01:50:28,054
“This is …” Maren paused.

1746
01:50:28,094 --> 01:50:30,094
“Different?” I offered.

1747
01:50:30,094 --> 01:50:32,774
“I was going to say creepy.”

1748
01:50:32,774 --> 01:50:33,654
I rolled my eyes.

1749
01:50:33,654 --> 01:50:40,054
It was a little creepy, but I wouldn’t tell her that. “Is
there another one of those hidden rooms in here?”

1750
01:50:40,054 --> 01:50:43,654
Maren smiled at me and walked over to the wall beside a tall
bookcase.

1751
01:50:43,654 --> 01:50:46,974
She pushed on one of the bricks in the wall and it slid to
the side.

1752
01:50:46,974 --> 01:50:48,574
My eyes widened in shock.

1753
01:50:48,574 --> 01:50:52,174
Inside the small chamber was an elderly woman.

1754
01:50:52,174 --> 01:50:53,854
I didn’t know who she was.

1755
01:50:53,854 --> 01:50:54,494
Maren gasped.

1756
01:50:54,494 --> 01:50:56,494
The woman was bound and gagged.

1757
01:50:56,494 --> 01:50:59,814
Her eyes were closed and for a moment, I thought she was
dead.

1758
01:50:59,854 --> 01:51:04,854
Upon further inspection, her body moved with her breathing
and relief washed over me.

1759
01:51:04,854 --> 01:51:10,854
“I think we know who’s working for the False King,” Maren
said, looking at me from over her shoulder.

1760
01:51:10,854 --> 01:51:15,534
“We need to move her out of here,” I replied. “Before
Josephine comes back.”

1761
01:51:15,534 --> 01:51:20,534
Just as we stepped into the small room, I heard footsteps
echoing in the hallway.

1762
01:51:20,534 --> 01:51:23,694
Fear made my heart feel like it dropped into my stomach.

1763
01:51:23,734 --> 01:51:28,094
Maren closed the door and we sat in the dark, not daring to
move at all.

1764
01:51:28,134 --> 01:51:35,214
I watched through the bricks, which I was beginning to
suspect were enchanted, as Josephine walked into the
chamber.

1765
01:51:35,214 --> 01:51:37,494
She closed the door and locked it.

1766
01:51:37,494 --> 01:51:41,054
The Curate walked with a natural grace that I hadn’t noticed
before.

1767
01:51:41,094 --> 01:51:45,934
In the center of the room was a brazier that looked like it
had never been used.

1768
01:51:45,934 --> 01:51:49,934
It was made of steel and shined eerily under the magical
light.

1769
01:51:49,974 --> 01:51:56,734
Josephine walked over to it and drew a dagger from her
robes, then ran the edge of the blade across her palm.

1770
01:51:56,734 --> 01:51:58,774
I winced involuntarily.

1771
01:51:58,774 --> 01:52:04,254
Josephine knelt in front of the brazier and ran her bloody
hand across the middle of it.

1772
01:52:04,254 --> 01:52:09,774
I knew that she was probably about to cast a spell, and my
curiosity kept my eyes glued to her.

1773
01:52:09,774 --> 01:52:18,014
She grabbed a handful of bright yellow powder from a bowl beside the brazier and spoke an arcane word as she threw the
powder onto the brazier.

1774
01:52:18,014 --> 01:52:22,254
Flames roared to life and the smell of smoke and ether
filled my nostrils.

1775
01:52:22,294 --> 01:52:27,374
I glanced over at Maren, but she was watching Josephine as
intently as I was.

1776
01:52:27,374 --> 01:52:29,694
“Master,” Josephine said.

1777
01:52:29,734 --> 01:52:32,374
I turned my gaze back to the Curate.

1778
01:52:32,374 --> 01:52:34,494
A dark figured appeared in the brazier.

1779
01:52:34,494 --> 01:52:40,694
The figure was wearing a robe and reminded me of the man who
had battled the boy in my Compassion test.

1780
01:52:40,694 --> 01:52:46,534
Dread started to set in as I realized that the two could be
connected if not the same man entirely.

1781
01:52:46,574 --> 01:52:48,854
“What is it?” the figure asked.

1782
01:52:48,854 --> 01:52:51,334
His voice was the same, hollow and shrill.

1783
01:52:51,334 --> 01:52:53,974
“We have a problem.”

1784
01:52:53,974 --> 01:52:58,614
The figure turned completely around in the brazier, taking
in the surroundings.

1785
01:52:58,694 --> 01:52:59,934
“Are we alone?”

1786
01:52:59,934 --> 01:53:00,574
“Yes.

1787
01:53:00,574 --> 01:53:01,614
Mostly.”

1788
01:53:01,614 --> 01:53:02,574
“Mostly?”

1789
01:53:02,574 --> 01:53:10,694
“One of the kitchen workers saw me putting poison into the food for Master Pevus,” Josephine said. “I was forced to tie
her up and she is here with us now.”

1790
01:53:10,694 --> 01:53:12,854
“A servant?” the figure asked.

1791
01:53:12,854 --> 01:53:14,094
“Yes, Master.”

1792
01:53:14,094 --> 01:53:16,494
The magical ball of light flickered.

1793
01:53:16,494 --> 01:53:19,774
“Why do you waste my time with such trivial matters?

1794
01:53:19,774 --> 01:53:23,294
Kill the servant and finish your task.”

1795
01:53:23,334 --> 01:53:24,094
“Kill her?

1796
01:53:24,094 --> 01:53:25,294
Are you sure?”

1797
01:53:25,294 --> 01:53:29,135
The room darkened even further until I could barely see
Josephine’s outline.

1798
01:53:29,135 --> 01:53:33,015
“Forgive me, Master,” Josephine whispered.

1799
01:53:33,015 --> 01:53:35,775
I could hear the fear in her voice.

1800
01:53:35,815 --> 01:53:42,575
“Forgiveness is for the weak,” the figure said. “Do as I
have commanded, or I will send another to replace you.”

1801
01:53:42,575 --> 01:53:44,615
“Of course, Master.”

1802
01:53:44,655 --> 01:53:45,735
“Is there anything else?”

1803
01:53:45,735 --> 01:53:57,495
“Master Pevus is growing suspicious,” Josephine replied. “One of the students was warned of the False King’s return
by the magic of the testing chamber.”

1804
01:53:57,495 --> 01:54:01,655
“I’m aware of the magic’s warning,” the figure said
dismissively.

1805
01:54:01,655 --> 01:54:06,295
I knew then that the figure from my test and the one
speaking were the same.

1806
01:54:06,295 --> 01:54:09,455
“Master Pevus has dispatched scouts to the border.

1807
01:54:09,455 --> 01:54:11,455
They should arrive soon.”

1808
01:54:11,495 --> 01:54:13,815
“Yes, they arrived a few hours ago.

1809
01:54:13,815 --> 01:54:17,415
Master Pevus should not expect their return.”

1810
01:54:17,455 --> 01:54:19,895
Maren and I looked at each other at the same time.

1811
01:54:19,895 --> 01:54:22,655
I could see my concern reflected in her green eyes.

1812
01:54:22,695 --> 01:54:27,655
My heart was pounding and sweat droplets were rolling down
my sides.

1813
01:54:27,695 --> 01:54:29,375
This was bad.

1814
01:54:29,415 --> 01:54:34,215
“Won’t that make him more intent on finding out what’s
happening?”

1815
01:54:34,215 --> 01:54:35,335
“Let him wonder.

1816
01:54:35,375 --> 01:54:36,495
My army swells in number daily.

1817
01:54:36,495 --> 01:54:42,815
By the time the dragoons are recalled across the kingdom and
reach the border, it will be too late.

1818
01:54:42,855 --> 01:54:45,455
I have other matters to attend to.

1819
01:54:45,455 --> 01:54:48,055
Kill the servant and poison Master Pevus.

1820
01:54:48,135 --> 01:54:50,175
Do not fail me in this.”

1821
01:54:50,175 --> 01:54:51,495
Josephine bowed.

1822
01:54:51,495 --> 01:54:54,495
The light brightened and the dark figure faded from view.

1823
01:54:54,495 --> 01:55:00,455
The brazier was spotless as if there had been no blood on it
at all.

1824
01:55:00,455 --> 01:55:05,375
The silence was intense and I held my breath for fear that
Josephine would hear me.

1825
01:55:05,415 --> 01:55:08,935
She rose and stepped toward us, then hesitated.

1826
01:55:08,975 --> 01:55:13,815
She had a thoughtful look on her face, then she unlocked the
door and left.

1827
01:55:13,815 --> 01:55:18,415
I waited a moment to make sure she was gone before pushing
the wall open and stepping out.

1828
01:55:18,415 --> 01:55:20,975
Maren joined me and we looked at the bound woman.

1829
01:55:20,975 --> 01:55:28,735
“This is the proof we need,” Maren said. “If we can get her
to the master, she can tell him what she saw.”

1830
01:55:28,775 --> 01:55:31,295
“I can’t believe Josephine is the spy,” I said.

1831
01:55:31,295 --> 01:55:38,495
“You heard and saw what I did,” Maren replied. “Hurry, let’s
carry her to the master’s chamber.”

1832
01:55:38,495 --> 01:55:44,015
Maren grabbed the woman’s feet and I tried to lift her by
the shoulders, but she was heavier than she looked.

1833
01:55:44,095 --> 01:55:45,055
“She’s frail,” I said. “How is she so heavy?”

1834
01:55:45,055 --> 01:55:45,735
Maren closed her eyes and whispered something under her
breath.

1835
01:55:45,735 --> 01:55:47,775
A few seconds later, she opened them and said, “It’s magic.

1836
01:55:47,775 --> 01:55:47,975
I can sense it.”

1837
01:55:47,975 --> 01:55:50,215
“Can you break the spell?” I asked.

1838
01:55:50,215 --> 01:55:50,815
“No.

1839
01:55:50,815 --> 01:55:52,255
It’s powerful magic.

1840
01:55:52,415 --> 01:55:53,375
Old magic.”

1841
01:55:53,375 --> 01:55:54,575
“What do we do?

1842
01:55:54,575 --> 01:55:55,735
We can’t just leave her here.” I said.

1843
01:55:55,775 --> 01:55:56,695
“We’ll have to.

1844
01:55:56,695 --> 01:56:00,455
Just long enough to get the master and bring him back here.”

1845
01:56:00,495 --> 01:56:03,175
Without another word, we ran to Master Pevus’s chamber.

1846
01:56:03,175 --> 01:56:04,495
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1847
01:56:04,535 --> 01:56:07,655
Master Pevus listened to Maren’s tale without saying a word.

1848
01:56:07,655 --> 01:56:10,495
His face, however, became stern as she talked.

1849
01:56:10,535 --> 01:56:15,175
I was ready for him to call for dragoons to find Josephine
and lock her in the dungeon.

1850
01:56:15,175 --> 01:56:16,855
Instead, he surprised me.

1851
01:56:16,935 --> 01:56:27,895
“You are walking a dangerous line,” Master Pevus said. “Accusing a Curate of treachery and potential murder without
proof will have you removed from the school, regardless of who you are.”

1852
01:56:27,895 --> 01:56:32,015
“We have proof,” Maren said. “The woman is still in
Josephine’s chamber.

1853
01:56:32,015 --> 01:56:33,895
She’s been ensorcelled in place.

1854
01:56:33,895 --> 01:56:40,935
We tried to move her before I realized that a spell was
preventing us from doing so.”

1855
01:56:41,055 --> 01:56:44,935
“Master,” I said. “I was there and saw everything Maren told
you.

1856
01:56:44,975 --> 01:56:47,535
Two witnesses must account for something.”

1857
01:56:47,655 --> 01:56:52,415
“Very well,” Master Pevus said, rising from his chair. “Lead
the way.”

1858
01:56:52,415 --> 01:56:53,775
Maren took off straight away.

1859
01:56:53,775 --> 01:56:56,255
I followed after her and Master Pevus brought up the rear.

1860
01:56:56,255 --> 01:57:02,935
I was worried that he might not be able to keep up, but after a couple of glances over my shoulder, I had nothing to
worry about.

1861
01:57:02,975 --> 01:57:07,295
Although he was aged, he moved quickly and stayed close
behind me.

1862
01:57:07,295 --> 01:57:10,295
The entire way, I hoped that we hadn’t taken too long.

1863
01:57:10,335 --> 01:57:12,815
If the woman had been killed, I didn’t know what I would do.

1864
01:57:12,815 --> 01:57:16,015
I silently prayed that the woman was safe.

1865
01:57:16,015 --> 01:57:21,135
As we neared the door to Josephine’s chamber, Master Pevus
strode past us and pushed it open.

1866
01:57:21,215 --> 01:57:24,055
He disappeared inside and Maren and I hurried to catch up.

1867
01:57:24,095 --> 01:57:28,655
“I see nothing,” Master Pevus said, looking around the room.

1868
01:57:28,655 --> 01:57:31,615
Everything was the same except the hidden chamber was now
closed.

1869
01:57:31,655 --> 01:57:36,855
Maren walked over to the wall and pushed the same brick as
before, then stood aside as the wall slid open.

1870
01:57:36,855 --> 01:57:39,695
Master Pevus seemed taken aback.

1871
01:57:39,695 --> 01:57:42,495
I looked inside and saw that the woman was gone.

1872
01:57:42,495 --> 01:57:45,175
“How do you know of the hidden room?” he asked.

1873
01:57:45,175 --> 01:57:51,695
“I saw it on a map,” Maren replied. “But look!” She pointed
and turned to look inside the room.

1874
01:57:51,695 --> 01:57:53,375
Then she froze.

1875
01:57:53,415 --> 01:57:56,215
“Look at what?” Master Pevus demanded.

1876
01:57:56,215 --> 01:58:00,935
“The woman was in here,” Maren said. “She was lying right
here!”

1877
01:58:00,975 --> 01:58:04,735
Master Pevus looked at me and I nodded. “She was.”

1878
01:58:04,735 --> 01:58:10,175
He looked back at the hidden room and remained silent for so
long that it became uncomfortable.

1879
01:58:10,215 --> 01:58:12,535
I had no idea what he was thinking.

1880
01:58:12,535 --> 01:58:14,015
My thoughts were on the woman.

1881
01:58:14,015 --> 01:58:15,015
Where had she gone?

1882
01:58:15,015 --> 01:58:18,855
Had Josephine carried her off to kill her in someplace less
conspicuous?

1883
01:58:18,855 --> 01:58:21,135
My heart sank in defeat.

1884
01:58:21,175 --> 01:58:22,375
We were too late.

1885
01:58:22,375 --> 01:58:27,015
“You will not repeat what you told me to anyone,” Master
Pevus said. “Is that clear?”

1886
01:58:27,055 --> 01:58:28,895
“Yes, Master,” I said.

1887
01:58:28,895 --> 01:58:30,855
“Do you believe us?” Maren asked.

1888
01:58:30,855 --> 01:58:32,295
“How can I?

1889
01:58:32,335 --> 01:58:35,975
There is nothing here to suggest your story ever happened.”

1890
01:58:36,015 --> 01:58:39,575
“Why would we lie about it?” Maren said, indignant.

1891
01:58:39,575 --> 01:58:40,255
“Why indeed?

1892
01:58:40,255 --> 01:58:47,535
Regardless, you will not tell this story to anyone and I
will not excommunicate you from the school for false claims.

1893
01:58:47,535 --> 01:58:50,855
This behavior is very unbecoming of a princess.”

1894
01:58:50,855 --> 01:58:56,575
Maren opened her mouth as if to say something, but Master
Pevus scowled and she remained quiet.

1895
01:58:56,615 --> 01:59:03,935
We left Josephine’s room and Master Pevus closed the door
and offered us each a pointed look, then he stalked off.

1896
01:59:03,935 --> 01:59:08,295
After he was gone, I looked at Maren questioningly. “A
princess?

1897
01:59:08,295 --> 01:59:09,295
You’re a princess?

1898
01:59:09,295 --> 01:59:10,615
The princess?”

1899
01:59:10,615 --> 01:59:14,095
Maren rolled her eyes. “Yes, but that doesn’t matter.”

1900
01:59:14,175 --> 01:59:15,335
“Yes, it does matter.

1901
01:59:15,415 --> 01:59:16,815
Why didn’t you tell me?

1902
01:59:16,815 --> 01:59:18,015
And how’re you royalty?

1903
01:59:18,015 --> 01:59:19,095
Your hair is black.”

1904
01:59:19,095 --> 01:59:22,855
Maren grabbed some of her hair and ran her fingers through
it, making them black.

1905
01:59:22,855 --> 01:59:25,375
Where she had rubbed, her hair was red.

1906
01:59:25,415 --> 01:59:27,095
I stared in disbelief.

1907
01:59:27,215 --> 01:59:29,775
“What is that stuff?” I asked.

1908
01:59:29,775 --> 01:59:31,175
“Charcoal.”

1909
01:59:31,175 --> 01:59:33,095
“Why are you hiding who you are?”

1910
01:59:33,095 --> 01:59:37,535
Maren sighed and cast her gaze to the floor. “You wouldn’t
understand.”

1911
01:59:37,535 --> 01:59:38,655
“I might.”

1912
01:59:38,695 --> 01:59:42,535
“All my life, I’ve been given whatever I want simply because
of who I am.”

1913
01:59:42,535 --> 01:59:46,455
“Is that a complaint?” I asked, not trying to hide the
sarcasm.

1914
01:59:46,455 --> 01:59:49,135
“What I mean is that I never have to work for anything.

1915
01:59:49,135 --> 01:59:52,375
I never have the opportunity to prove myself.

1916
01:59:52,375 --> 02:00:00,455
I thought if I came here and passed the tests with no one knowing who I was, then I would finally show everyone, and
myself, what I can do.”

1917
02:00:00,455 --> 02:00:02,015
That made sense to me.

1918
02:00:02,015 --> 02:00:09,935
I found it difficult to understand why someone would want to step away from having everything to willingly work for
something, but I could understand her intent.

1919
02:00:09,935 --> 02:00:17,935
I, too, wanted to prove that I was worthy to be a dragoon, to prove that I was worthy of the respect that my father’s
deeds had earned.

1920
02:00:18,055 --> 02:00:22,455
“You could have told me,” I said. “Are you really a
sorcerer?”

1921
02:00:22,455 --> 02:00:25,575
“Yes,” Maren replied. “Why?”

1922
02:00:25,575 --> 02:00:29,175
“Well, I don’t know what to believe when it comes to you.

1923
02:00:29,175 --> 02:00:35,735
No wonder you weren’t scared of being kicked out of the
school for breaking the rules.

1924
02:00:35,735 --> 02:00:39,695
Your father would just force Master Pevus into letting you
stay.”

1925
02:00:39,695 --> 02:00:41,575
“That’s not true.

1926
02:00:41,575 --> 02:00:45,215
My father may be the king, but he doesn’t have any authority
here.”

1927
02:00:45,255 --> 02:00:50,055
“Based on what we heard in the council meeting, that may not
be true,” I replied.

1928
02:00:50,055 --> 02:00:51,175
Maren paused.

1929
02:00:51,175 --> 02:00:52,575
She knew I was right.

1930
02:00:52,575 --> 02:00:55,735
The king could demand anything he wanted, from anyone.

1931
02:00:55,735 --> 02:01:00,655
“It doesn’t matter,” I said. “We need to find where
Josephine took that woman.”

1932
02:01:00,655 --> 02:01:09,295
“I don’t even know where to start,” Maren said. “I don’t know anything about Josephine, so it’s going to be difficult
tracking down where she goes.”

1933
02:01:09,295 --> 02:01:11,615
“Are you giving up?” I asked.

1934
02:01:11,615 --> 02:01:14,135
“No, of course not.

1935
02:01:14,135 --> 02:01:15,336
I never give up.”

1936
02:01:15,336 --> 02:01:17,376
“Then let’s start looking.”

1937
02:01:17,376 --> 02:01:19,256
We left Josephine’s room behind and searched for hours.

1938
02:01:19,256 --> 02:01:23,216
Everywhere we looked, there was no sign of Josephine or the
elderly woman.

1939
02:01:23,216 --> 02:01:26,016
Maren led me to tons of hidden rooms.

1940
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:30,016
All of them were empty and didn’t appear to have been used
in years.

1941
02:01:30,016 --> 02:01:35,616
Thick layers of dust covered the floors and the only prints
that marred the dust belonged to mice.

1942
02:01:35,736 --> 02:01:36,656
Or rats.

1943
02:01:36,656 --> 02:01:39,896
The thirteenth bell rang, signaling dinner.

1944
02:01:39,896 --> 02:01:45,096
Neither of us admitted what we feared, but I knew that she
had the same thoughts I did.

1945
02:01:45,136 --> 02:01:48,216
Josephine had probably killed the old woman already.

1946
02:01:48,216 --> 02:01:55,536
If we could at least find the body, then perhaps that would
be enough proof for Master Pevus.

1947
02:01:55,576 --> 02:01:57,736
We headed to the dining hall in silence.

1948
02:01:57,736 --> 02:02:01,296
I ate until I was full, but I could barely taste the food.

1949
02:02:01,296 --> 02:02:05,256
Everything from earlier felt like a dream, as though it
hadn’t happened.

1950
02:02:05,256 --> 02:02:10,416
As much as I wished that was true, I knew that Josephine was
an agent of the False King.

1951
02:02:10,416 --> 02:02:14,896
“Who do you think that man is that Josephine was talking
to?” I asked.

1952
02:02:14,896 --> 02:02:19,456
“I don’t know,” Maren replied. “He gives me the creeps,
though.”

1953
02:02:19,456 --> 02:02:20,176
“Same here.

1954
02:02:20,176 --> 02:02:25,256
He was able to control Josephine’s magic ball of light, so
he must be a sorcerer of some kind.”

1955
02:02:25,256 --> 02:02:31,336
“That makes sense, but I only know of a handful of sorcerers
who aided the False King in his war, and they all died.”

1956
02:02:31,336 --> 02:02:39,776
“Did they?” I asked. “Everyone seems to think the False King died as well, but recent events make it sound like that may
not be the case.”

1957
02:02:39,816 --> 02:02:41,456
“Fair enough,” Maren said.

1958
02:02:41,456 --> 02:02:46,816
I yawned and leaned back in my chair. “We only have a few
hours before curfew.

1959
02:02:46,816 --> 02:02:51,976
I want to keep searching, but I’m exhausted and tomorrow we
have to take the next test.”

1960
02:02:52,016 --> 02:02:53,256
Maren looked at me.

1961
02:02:53,256 --> 02:02:54,216
Her eyes were watery.

1962
02:02:54,216 --> 02:02:56,776
“What’s wrong?” I asked.

1963
02:02:56,776 --> 02:03:02,656
“I can’t help but think that I could have done more to free
that woman from Josephine’s spells.”

1964
02:03:02,656 --> 02:03:05,936
“You said yourself that the magic was too strong.”

1965
02:03:05,936 --> 02:03:08,976
“I know, but I didn’t even try to break the spell.

1966
02:03:09,016 --> 02:03:11,416
What if I had and we had been able to free her?

1967
02:03:11,416 --> 02:03:13,976
She would still be alive.”

1968
02:03:14,016 --> 02:03:20,416
“She could still be alive now,” I said. “We haven’t found
any trace of them, but that doesn’t mean Josephine killed
her.

1969
02:03:20,416 --> 02:03:22,496
Maybe she just moved her somewhere else?”

1970
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:24,216
“Maybe,” Maren replied.

1971
02:03:24,216 --> 02:03:26,856
She wiped the edges of her eyes with the end of her sleeve.

1972
02:03:26,856 --> 02:03:29,936
“We can look some more tomorrow when our tests are done,” I
offered.

1973
02:03:29,936 --> 02:03:31,376
“That’s a good idea.

1974
02:03:31,376 --> 02:03:37,216
I think I’m going to bed early,” Maren said. “I’ve got a lot
on my mind that I need to deal with.”

1975
02:03:37,216 --> 02:03:39,456
“Now that is a good idea,” I said.

1976
02:03:39,456 --> 02:03:43,736
“That’s the only kind I have,” Maren said, her mouth curling
into a smirk.

1977
02:03:43,736 --> 02:03:50,416
“There she is.” I didn’t like seeing her downcast, but I
understood how she felt.

1978
02:03:50,416 --> 02:03:54,576
If we had done more to try and free the woman, perhaps we
would have succeeded.

1979
02:03:54,616 --> 02:03:57,896
We left the dining hall and walked together to our wing of
the Citadel.

1980
02:03:57,896 --> 02:04:03,936
Halfway there, Maren grabbed onto my hand and held it until
we parted ways at the top of the stairs.

1981
02:04:03,936 --> 02:04:05,416
“Goodnight, Eldwin.

1982
02:04:05,416 --> 02:04:06,736
And good luck tomorrow.

1983
02:04:06,776 --> 02:04:08,456
I’ll meet you here after the tests?”

1984
02:04:08,456 --> 02:04:13,616
It was a question more than a statement, and I nodded. “Yes,
it’s a plan.”

1985
02:04:13,616 --> 02:04:19,536
“Good.” She started to walk away, then paused. “It could be
a date, instead.”

1986
02:04:19,536 --> 02:04:22,296
Then she left me standing alone, my cheeks flushed red.

1987
02:04:22,296 --> 02:04:23,776
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1988
02:04:23,776 --> 02:04:28,896
When the bell rang for breakfast in the morning, I was
already awake and dressed in my robes.

1989
02:04:28,896 --> 02:04:35,096
I’d found it difficult to get to sleep after Maren had said
our time today would be a date.

1990
02:04:35,096 --> 02:04:41,456
Who would have thought that a low born like me would even
spend time with a princess, let alone go on a date with one?

1991
02:04:41,456 --> 02:04:42,736
Certainly not me.

1992
02:04:42,736 --> 02:04:46,976
I entered the dining hall and filled my plate with a biscuit
and some eggs.

1993
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:49,896
Steam rose from the eggs and the smell made my mouth water.

1994
02:04:49,976 --> 02:04:54,176
I had noticed that most of the other students didn’t come in
for breakfast until later.

1995
02:04:54,216 --> 02:04:57,816
The lack of chores had probably made them more apt to sleep
in.

1996
02:04:57,816 --> 02:05:02,616
Since today was the second test, I made sure to eat enough
to hold me over until lunch.

1997
02:05:02,656 --> 02:05:04,456
Oddly, I didn’t see Maren.

1998
02:05:04,456 --> 02:05:12,016
After I finished eating, I wandered the halls for a while to
see if I could find her, but I had no luck.

1999
02:05:12,096 --> 02:05:15,776
I ended up going back to our wing of the Citadel to wait for
Curate Anesko.

2000
02:05:15,776 --> 02:05:18,456
He was already there, and he didn’t look happy.

2001
02:05:18,456 --> 02:05:20,696
I heard him muttering about everyone running late.

2002
02:05:20,696 --> 02:05:24,696
I was glad to be one of the only ones waiting.

2003
02:05:24,696 --> 02:05:26,856
Maybe he would look on me favorably for being early.

2004
02:05:26,856 --> 02:05:33,896
As everyone else slowly joined us, I saw Maren coming from the direction of the stables and realized why I hadn’t found
her.

2005
02:05:33,936 --> 02:05:37,456
I shook my head at her and she flashed me a smile.

2006
02:05:37,456 --> 02:05:40,696
No one could keep her away from the dragons.

2007
02:05:40,696 --> 02:05:42,696
She came to stand beside me.

2008
02:05:42,696 --> 02:05:45,376
“Begging for trouble?” I whispered.

2009
02:05:45,376 --> 02:05:48,576
“You’re just jealous,” she said with a laugh.

2010
02:05:48,576 --> 02:05:50,056
“Seriously, Maren.

2011
02:05:50,056 --> 02:05:52,296
I would try to keep away from trouble.

2012
02:05:52,336 --> 02:05:59,216
Especially since Master Pevus didn’t believe us about …” I glanced around to make sure no one was listening. “… you
know who.”

2013
02:05:59,216 --> 02:06:02,056
“I won’t get caught,” she said.

2014
02:06:02,056 --> 02:06:05,616
I stared at her until she offered an exaggerated sigh.
“Fine.

2015
02:06:05,616 --> 02:06:07,416
I suppose you’re right.”

2016
02:06:07,416 --> 02:06:10,056
Curate Anesko cleared his throat, drawing our attention.

2017
02:06:10,056 --> 02:06:11,536
The group went silent.

2018
02:06:11,576 --> 02:06:14,616
“Today you will all be taking the Magical Aptitude test.

2019
02:06:14,616 --> 02:06:19,096
This test will evaluate your common sense when it comes to
spellcasting.

2020
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:25,536
Unlike the Compassion test, this one is much more involved
and will likely go late into the evening.”

2021
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:29,056
Anesko paused and looked at each of us in turn.

2022
02:06:29,056 --> 02:06:34,136
I was trying to figure out how I would take a test that
required magical talent when I didn’t have any.

2023
02:06:34,176 --> 02:06:39,456
I was fairly certain that none of us, except for Maren, had
any magical inclination.

2024
02:06:39,456 --> 02:06:43,016
“Those of you lucky enough to bond with a dragon will learn
many things.

2025
02:06:43,016 --> 02:06:46,336
One of which is that dragons are powerful magic users.

2026
02:06:46,376 --> 02:06:51,376
As the bond grows, you will gain abilities you don’t
currently have.

2027
02:06:51,376 --> 02:07:00,816
Most of you will gain the skill to cast minor spells, but some of you may become strong in spellcasting, especially
depending upon your dragon.

2028
02:07:00,856 --> 02:07:07,456
“If you do not currently possess the talent for magic, you will be given a potion that will temporarily allow you to
cast spells.

2029
02:07:07,976 --> 02:07:13,856
You will drink it before entering the test and it will last
for several hours.

2030
02:07:13,856 --> 02:07:16,936
That should be plenty of time to get through the obstacles.

2031
02:07:16,936 --> 02:07:18,976
If not, then you will know that you failed.

2032
02:07:18,976 --> 02:07:22,256
Are there any questions?”

2033
02:07:22,256 --> 02:07:23,416
Silence.

2034
02:07:23,416 --> 02:07:23,936
“Good.

2035
02:07:23,936 --> 02:07:24,856
Follow me.”

2036
02:07:24,856 --> 02:07:28,816
Curate Anesko led us out of the Citadel and to the right
side of the grounds.

2037
02:07:28,856 --> 02:07:32,976
We were still behind the wall that separated the school from
the surrounding city.

2038
02:07:32,976 --> 02:07:37,696
Large, towering bushes formed a solid wall that I was unable
to see through.

2039
02:07:37,736 --> 02:07:41,176
The bushes seemed out of place as if they weren’t normally
there.

2040
02:07:41,176 --> 02:07:47,256
A long table was set up nearby, covered with at least a
hundred vials filled with green liquid.

2041
02:07:47,336 --> 02:07:50,656
In front of the table, rows of chairs had been set out.

2042
02:07:50,656 --> 02:07:53,536
Anesko ordered us to sit and we obeyed.

2043
02:07:53,536 --> 02:08:03,736
The wall of shrubbery rippled oddly, like a wave across the surface of a lake, and then it split open and Master Pevus
stepped out.

2044
02:08:03,736 --> 02:08:09,216
I craned my neck to glance into the opening and briefly saw
a maze before the wall closed.

2045
02:08:09,296 --> 02:08:14,056
The Master still looked rough, but he didn’t seem as
exhausted as yesterday.

2046
02:08:14,136 --> 02:08:18,376
The Curates gathered around him and they conversed lowly.

2047
02:08:18,376 --> 02:08:22,176
I assumed they were talking about the test or something
related to it.

2048
02:08:22,176 --> 02:08:24,576
I smiled at Maren as she sat beside me.

2049
02:08:24,696 --> 02:08:26,816
“Are you nervous?” she asked.

2050
02:08:26,816 --> 02:08:28,216
“A little,” I lied.

2051
02:08:28,216 --> 02:08:31,656
I was terrified, more so than I was for the Compassion test.

2052
02:08:31,656 --> 02:08:38,536
Even though we would drink a potion that would let us use magic, I knew nothing about the arcane and feared I was
going to fail.

2053
02:08:38,576 --> 02:08:39,736
“Don’t be.

2054
02:08:39,736 --> 02:08:41,816
You’ll do fine, I’m sure.

2055
02:08:41,816 --> 02:08:43,136
You’ve got a strong will.

2056
02:08:43,136 --> 02:08:48,936
And spellcasting is mostly impressing your will on the magic
to do what you want it to.”

2057
02:08:48,936 --> 02:08:51,336
“Really?” I asked.

2058
02:08:51,336 --> 02:08:52,016
“Yes.

2059
02:08:52,016 --> 02:08:57,056
For me, it helps if I close my eyes and try to visualize
what I want the magic to do.

2060
02:08:57,096 --> 02:09:00,056
Sometimes, anger makes the spell stronger.”

2061
02:09:00,056 --> 02:09:01,776
“Like in the alley?”

2062
02:09:01,776 --> 02:09:02,656
Maren nodded.

2063
02:09:02,656 --> 02:09:05,377
We watched as Master Pevus called the first student up.

2064
02:09:05,377 --> 02:09:08,017
Curate Anesko handed the student a vial from the table.

2065
02:09:08,017 --> 02:09:11,017
He drank it, then walked toward the wall of bushes.

2066
02:09:11,017 --> 02:09:15,217
They parted to let him enter, then quickly closed once he
walked inside.

2067
02:09:15,217 --> 02:09:18,697
The next few hours were filled with excruciating boredom as
we waited.

2068
02:09:18,697 --> 02:09:25,377
Lunch was catered outside, and no one was allowed back into
the Citadel unless they needed to use the lavatory.

2069
02:09:25,377 --> 02:09:28,177
And that required an escort from one of the Curates.

2070
02:09:28,177 --> 02:09:34,257
The sky was overcast and a gentle breeze was blowing, which
provided a respite from the heat.

2071
02:09:34,257 --> 02:09:40,657
It was the middle of summer, and days like this were rare,
so I enjoyed every minute of it.

2072
02:09:40,697 --> 02:09:43,617
I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes.

2073
02:09:43,617 --> 02:09:45,697
The wind felt amazing against my face.

2074
02:09:45,737 --> 02:09:50,537
I tried to imagine what the wind would feel like while
riding on the back of a dragon.

2075
02:09:50,577 --> 02:09:54,897
Eventually, I opened my eyes and became aware of dragons
flying overhead.

2076
02:09:54,897 --> 02:09:56,137
There were two of them.

2077
02:09:56,177 --> 02:09:58,177
One was blue, and the other was green.

2078
02:09:58,217 --> 02:10:05,177
They floated lazily above the maze, and I assumed their
riders were looking down, watching the test unfold.

2079
02:10:05,177 --> 02:10:08,777
The scales of the dragons shimmered and I nudged Maren with
my elbow.

2080
02:10:08,777 --> 02:10:10,657
“Look,” I said.

2081
02:10:10,657 --> 02:10:16,697
She looked up and smiled. “I think that’s Azer and Zymon.”

2082
02:10:16,697 --> 02:10:18,577
“They have names?” I asked.

2083
02:10:18,617 --> 02:10:20,937
It sounded dumb as soon as the words left my mouth.

2084
02:10:20,937 --> 02:10:22,217
“Of course.

2085
02:10:22,217 --> 02:10:23,857
All dragons have names.”

2086
02:10:23,857 --> 02:10:26,297
“How do you know their names?”

2087
02:10:26,297 --> 02:10:27,217
“They told me.”

2088
02:10:27,217 --> 02:10:28,697
“They who?” I asked.

2089
02:10:28,697 --> 02:10:30,337
“Azer and Zymon.”

2090
02:10:30,337 --> 02:10:32,097
“The dragons spoke to you?”

2091
02:10:32,097 --> 02:10:37,377
“Sort of,” Maren said. “Once you are bonded to one, you’ll
be able to speak with them telepathically.

2092
02:10:37,377 --> 02:10:41,897
If you aren’t bonded to one, they usually choose to only
share impressions with you.

2093
02:10:41,897 --> 02:10:47,177
Since I’ve been going down to the stables to see them so
often, they’ve become comfortable around me.”

2094
02:10:47,177 --> 02:10:50,177
“I would love to do that,” I said. “But …”

2095
02:10:50,177 --> 02:10:55,137
“You don’t want to get in trouble, I know.”

2096
02:10:55,137 --> 02:11:00,257
I nodded my agreement and continued to watch the dragons as
they circled over the maze.

2097
02:11:00,257 --> 02:11:02,977
“Do all dragons breathe fire?” I asked.

2098
02:11:02,977 --> 02:11:06,697
“Yes, but every color of dragon has a unique breath ability
also.

2099
02:11:06,697 --> 02:11:10,697
Well, almost all of them.”

2100
02:11:10,697 --> 02:11:12,217
“What do you mean?”

2101
02:11:12,217 --> 02:11:14,337
“Blue dragons breathe lightning, but also breathe fire.”

2102
02:11:14,377 --> 02:11:15,017
“Oh.

2103
02:11:15,017 --> 02:11:16,377
That’s interesting.

2104
02:11:16,417 --> 02:11:18,057
What about green ones?” I asked.

2105
02:11:18,057 --> 02:11:18,617
“Acid.

2106
02:11:18,617 --> 02:11:20,817
Black dragons also breathe acid.”

2107
02:11:20,817 --> 02:11:22,617
“White ones?”

2108
02:11:22,617 --> 02:11:23,897
“Frost.”

2109
02:11:23,897 --> 02:11:25,577
That made my brows raise in surprise. “Wow.

2110
02:11:25,577 --> 02:11:28,217
Imagine a dragon breathing frost at you.

2111
02:11:28,217 --> 02:11:31,097
You’d probably freeze within seconds.”

2112
02:11:31,137 --> 02:11:33,577
“Probably,” Maren agreed.

2113
02:11:33,577 --> 02:11:35,217
“What about red ones?”

2114
02:11:35,217 --> 02:11:36,457
“Only fire.

2115
02:11:36,457 --> 02:11:42,937
They are the exception in that they don’t have a second
breath, but their fire is much stronger than the other
colors.”

2116
02:11:42,937 --> 02:11:46,737
“What color dragon do you want to bond with?” I asked.

2117
02:11:46,737 --> 02:11:51,417
“Green,” Maren answered without hesitation. “You?”

2118
02:11:51,457 --> 02:11:55,977
“I’m not sure,” I said. “I’ve thought about it a lot, but I
just can’t decide.

2119
02:11:55,977 --> 02:11:58,617
I think bonding with any dragon would be amazing.”

2120
02:11:58,737 --> 02:11:59,737
“I agree.”

2121
02:11:59,737 --> 02:12:03,577
The hours continued to pass and dinner was also catered
outside.

2122
02:12:03,577 --> 02:12:10,137
By the time the sun began to set, there were still about
fifteen students left to be tested, including myself and
Maren.

2123
02:12:10,137 --> 02:12:16,177
When it was Maren’s turn to go, she touched my hand briefly,
then went up to Master Pevus.

2124
02:12:16,217 --> 02:12:21,137
Since she was magically inclined, she didn’t need to drink
one of the vials.

2125
02:12:21,177 --> 02:12:25,137
I watched her disappear into the maze and began to wonder
what awaited me inside.

2126
02:12:25,137 --> 02:12:31,337
The sun vanished completely and the Curates cast spells of
light to illuminate the area.

2127
02:12:31,337 --> 02:12:38,377
Glowing balls of light, much like the one I’d seen in Josephine’s chamber, bobbed in the air, casting their
brilliance everywhere.

2128
02:12:38,417 --> 02:12:40,897
Except on the wall of bushes.

2129
02:12:40,937 --> 02:12:49,977
They remained dark as if they sucked the light from the air
around them and suffocated it.

2130
02:12:49,977 --> 02:12:51,937
I swallowed hard as I stared at the wall.

2131
02:12:51,937 --> 02:12:54,817
Master Pevus called my name and I rose to my sheet.

2132
02:12:54,857 --> 02:12:58,337
My knees felt weak and my palms were sweating.

2133
02:12:58,337 --> 02:13:01,177
It’s time to prove myself, I thought.

2134
02:13:01,217 --> 02:13:02,097
I can do this.

2135
02:13:02,137 --> 02:13:04,857
I reached the table and Curate Anesko gave me a vial.

2136
02:13:04,897 --> 02:13:08,777
I held it up and looked at it, then put it to my mouth and
lifted the vial.

2137
02:13:08,777 --> 02:13:11,097
The liquid was thick and sluggish.

2138
02:13:11,097 --> 02:13:14,817
It felt like an eternity before the bitter taste hit my
tongue.

2139
02:13:14,857 --> 02:13:19,657
I resisted the urge to gag and made sure to drink as much of
the stuff as I could.

2140
02:13:19,657 --> 02:13:22,297
The effect of the potion hit me immediately.

2141
02:13:22,297 --> 02:13:25,417
It was like I had a sixth sense that had been awakened.

2142
02:13:25,497 --> 02:13:30,577
Master Pevus motioned me toward the wall of bushes. “Good
luck, Eldwin.”

2143
02:13:30,577 --> 02:13:34,217
I bowed my head at him as I passed, and stepped in front of
the wall.

2144
02:13:34,217 --> 02:13:36,617
The bushes parted, revealing a dark maze.

2145
02:13:36,617 --> 02:13:42,337
I could see glowing orbs floating in the maze, similar to
the ones the Curates had cast.

2146
02:13:42,337 --> 02:13:46,577
I cast a final glance behind me, then stepped into the maze.

2147
02:13:46,617 --> 02:13:48,057
CHAPTER SIXETEEN

2148
02:13:48,057 --> 02:13:49,537
Magic hummed in my ears.

2149
02:13:49,537 --> 02:13:52,817
It wasn’t overly loud, but it was noticeable.

2150
02:13:52,817 --> 02:14:02,377
The chirp of crickets, the cries of owls, and many other noises filled the night, but the magic stood out distinctly
from every other sound in the maze.

2151
02:14:02,377 --> 02:14:06,297
I stood still for a moment, taking in the sounds and looking
around.

2152
02:14:06,337 --> 02:14:10,017
The walls of the maze were all formed of the same shrubbery.

2153
02:14:10,017 --> 02:14:15,057
Despite knowing that I was on school grounds and taking a
test, I was a little scared.

2154
02:14:15,097 --> 02:14:24,257
I looked up to the sky and saw the dark silhouettes of the dragons, faint shapes of blackness against a bigger dark
canvas.

2155
02:14:24,257 --> 02:14:28,137
Somehow, knowing the dragons were up there brought me some
comfort.

2156
02:14:28,137 --> 02:14:32,417
Very few stars were visible, but the moon was full and
bright.

2157
02:14:32,537 --> 02:14:37,137
The pathway I stood on was made of gray and white
cobblestones.

2158
02:14:37,137 --> 02:14:43,777
The white portions glowed faintly under the light of the
moon and the magical globes floating around.

2159
02:14:43,857 --> 02:14:48,777
“I can do this,” I whispered to myself as I took a few steps
forward.

2160
02:14:48,777 --> 02:14:52,657
To my left, there was a brazier filled with flames.

2161
02:14:52,657 --> 02:14:54,857
An invisible wall of heat washed over me.

2162
02:14:54,857 --> 02:14:57,977
I was about to walk past it when I felt the pull of magic.

2163
02:14:58,017 --> 02:15:00,977
It was an urging deep within me, telling me to get closer.

2164
02:15:01,017 --> 02:15:06,937
Common sense warred against the magic, warning me to keep
away.

2165
02:15:06,937 --> 02:15:13,457
I remembered that Maren told me closing her eyes helped her with spellcasting, so I closed mine and listened to the
magic.

2166
02:15:13,497 --> 02:15:14,097
Water.

2167
02:15:14,177 --> 02:15:15,497
The word formed in my mind.

2168
02:15:15,537 --> 02:15:20,817
I lifted my hand and imagined a flow of water spraying from
my palm.

2169
02:15:20,857 --> 02:15:23,377
At first, nothing happened.

2170
02:15:23,377 --> 02:15:27,817
I focused harder, pressing my will against the magic as
Maren had told me.

2171
02:15:28,017 --> 02:15:31,257
There was a slight resistance but it quickly gave way.

2172
02:15:31,297 --> 02:15:35,017
I felt droplets of water begin to drip from my palm.

2173
02:15:35,017 --> 02:15:39,057
I opened my eyes in surprise and almost lost the connection
to the magic.

2174
02:15:39,057 --> 02:15:41,617
My sheer stubbornness saved the spell.

2175
02:15:41,617 --> 02:15:43,777
I refused to let go of the magic.

2176
02:15:43,777 --> 02:15:49,177
And then the resistance was gone completely and a torrent of
water flowed from my hand.

2177
02:15:49,177 --> 02:15:53,057
I stared in amazement as the liquid put out the flames in
the brazier.

2178
02:15:53,097 --> 02:15:55,417
The heat faded and I released the magic.

2179
02:15:55,417 --> 02:16:02,257
I looked at my palm, still reeling from the fact that I had
successfully cast a spell.

2180
02:16:02,297 --> 02:16:02,777
Me.

2181
02:16:02,777 --> 02:16:03,457
A low born.

2182
02:16:03,497 --> 02:16:11,697
I wiped my hand on my robes and looked around, wondering if I was supposed to navigate the entire maze, or just prove
that I was magically capable.

2183
02:16:11,737 --> 02:16:17,777
The wall behind the brazier parted and I felt the pull of
magic urging me to go through the opening.

2184
02:16:17,777 --> 02:16:20,977
I did, and the maze opened up into a large square.

2185
02:16:20,977 --> 02:16:24,897
In the right corner, something tall loomed in the darkness.

2186
02:16:24,897 --> 02:16:31,417
No magical lights shone there, nor did the moonlight seem to
be able to penetrate the gloom.

2187
02:16:31,417 --> 02:16:35,537
Curiosity got the better of me and I walked closer to see
what it was.

2188
02:16:35,537 --> 02:16:40,057
When I was only a few feet away, I felt the ground tremor
under my feet.

2189
02:16:40,097 --> 02:16:43,057
I stopped walking, but it was too late.

2190
02:16:43,097 --> 02:16:45,577
The colossal shape in the corner moved toward me.

2191
02:16:45,577 --> 02:16:52,097
I backpedaled and watched with a horrified interest as the
thing, whatever it was, stepped into the light.

2192
02:16:52,137 --> 02:16:57,538
It was at least three feet taller than me and appeared to be
made of dirt and rock.

2193
02:16:57,578 --> 02:17:00,938
It moved slowly but inexorably drew closer.

2194
02:17:01,058 --> 02:17:07,938
I kept a decent distance between us, but as I looked around
for an escape, I noticed that there wasn’t one.

2195
02:17:07,938 --> 02:17:10,778
The walls had closed and there was nowhere to go.

2196
02:17:10,778 --> 02:17:15,338
I kept moving, keeping out of arm’s length of the creature,
and considered my options.

2197
02:17:15,338 --> 02:17:23,018
It was possible this was part of the test, but what kind of
spell would defeat a creature made of the earth?

2198
02:17:23,018 --> 02:17:23,978
I didn’t know.

2199
02:17:23,978 --> 02:17:32,418
The magic pulled at me again, subtly getting louder and louder in my conscience until it was like someone was
shouting at me—from within my mind.

2200
02:17:32,418 --> 02:17:38,778
I jogged a few feet further away and closed my eyes for a
moment to focus on the magic.

2201
02:17:38,778 --> 02:17:41,858
Again, a word was impressed upon my mind.

2202
02:17:41,898 --> 02:17:42,618
Wind.

2203
02:17:42,618 --> 02:17:45,378
What would wind do against such a creature?

2204
02:17:45,378 --> 02:17:48,178
I opened my eyes and continued moving.

2205
02:17:48,178 --> 02:17:50,538
The creature didn’t stop.

2206
02:17:50,538 --> 02:17:56,658
It was only a matter of time before I got tired, but this
thing could probably walk all night without stopping.

2207
02:17:56,698 --> 02:17:58,338
I needed to do something.

2208
02:17:58,338 --> 02:17:59,818
“Wind,” I muttered.

2209
02:17:59,818 --> 02:18:05,698
I didn’t understand how the wind would stop this creature,
but I didn’t have any other options.

2210
02:18:05,698 --> 02:18:08,818
I hurried further away, then turned to face the monster.

2211
02:18:08,858 --> 02:18:13,898
I closed my eyes and focused on the magic like I had with
the first spell and envisioned a whirlwind.

2212
02:18:13,938 --> 02:18:17,818
I lifted both hands and put all of my willpower into the
magic.

2213
02:18:17,818 --> 02:18:22,538
I could feel the breeze getting stronger, but it was taking
too long.

2214
02:18:22,578 --> 02:18:27,258
The grumbling sound of the creature was getting closer, but
I kept my eyes closed.

2215
02:18:27,298 --> 02:18:30,738
If I lost the connection to the magic, the creature would
have me.

2216
02:18:30,738 --> 02:18:35,338
I changed plans and instead of a vortex, I imagined a gust
of air.

2217
02:18:35,338 --> 02:18:38,898
The wind picked up and my robes whipped around me
frantically.

2218
02:18:38,938 --> 02:18:43,218
I opened my eyes just in time to see the giant fist of the
creature coming down at me.

2219
02:18:43,218 --> 02:18:50,218
My eyes widened, but the spell had worked and a powerful gust of wind blew against the creature, pushing it back a
few feet.

2220
02:18:50,338 --> 02:18:52,258
The creature’s fist missed me.

2221
02:18:52,258 --> 02:18:54,418
It roared and struggled to come at me.

2222
02:18:54,458 --> 02:18:58,618
Surprisingly, I could feel the creature push against the
magic.

2223
02:18:58,658 --> 02:19:04,898
It was as though the wind were an extension of me, and
whatever happened to the wind, I could feel it in some small
way.

2224
02:19:04,938 --> 02:19:07,938
I gritted my teeth and forced the wind to blow harder.

2225
02:19:07,938 --> 02:19:12,538
The magic obeyed and whirled furiously around the creature.

2226
02:19:12,578 --> 02:19:17,418
Dirt and pieces of rock began to break free and were pulled
away by the wind.

2227
02:19:17,418 --> 02:19:19,178
The creature roared again.

2228
02:19:19,218 --> 02:19:23,938
It moved around, trying to escape, but the wind was
destroying the creature bit by bit.

2229
02:19:23,938 --> 02:19:30,138
With a sudden gust, the creature’s head parted from its body
and the rest of it collapsed into a mound of rubble.

2230
02:19:30,138 --> 02:19:33,098
I commanded the magic to stop and the wind calmed.

2231
02:19:33,098 --> 02:19:36,538
I was overcome with exhaustion and almost fell over.

2232
02:19:36,538 --> 02:19:39,058
My vision blurred and I thought I was going to pass out.

2233
02:19:39,058 --> 02:19:45,138
After a few moments of panic, the weakness went away but I
still felt drained.

2234
02:19:45,178 --> 02:19:47,098
Was the magic tied to my strength?

2235
02:19:47,098 --> 02:19:51,138
If so, that could end up being very inconvenient.

2236
02:19:51,138 --> 02:19:56,338
The wall of shrubbery directly across from where I came in
shifted and opened up.

2237
02:19:56,338 --> 02:19:59,498
I walked through and found myself on a long, straight path.

2238
02:19:59,618 --> 02:20:03,578
The walls rose up on either side of me, dark and imposing.

2239
02:20:03,618 --> 02:20:08,418
I stepped slowly and quietly, not wanting to be surprised
again.

2240
02:20:08,458 --> 02:20:11,938
I got midway along the path when I noticed a gray statue.

2241
02:20:11,938 --> 02:20:15,338
It was in the wall of shrubbery to my right.

2242
02:20:15,378 --> 02:20:20,698
The ornate details were startling, and for a moment I
thought the statue was alive.

2243
02:20:20,698 --> 02:20:24,258
I stared at it for a long while, then continued down the
path.

2244
02:20:24,298 --> 02:20:26,138
A sound behind me made me stop.

2245
02:20:26,178 --> 02:20:28,978
I didn’t turn around, but I listened intently.

2246
02:20:28,978 --> 02:20:29,418
Nothing.

2247
02:20:29,418 --> 02:20:32,938
I looked over my shoulder, but there was nothing there.

2248
02:20:32,938 --> 02:20:35,298
And then I saw that the statue was gone.

2249
02:20:35,298 --> 02:20:40,818
My heart started pounding in my chest and I realized that
the statue might be alive after all.

2250
02:20:40,818 --> 02:20:44,178
I turned back and there it was in front of me.

2251
02:20:44,218 --> 02:20:47,138
It had wickedly sharp teeth and long, deadly claws.

2252
02:20:47,138 --> 02:20:48,858
The magic felt different now.

2253
02:20:48,858 --> 02:20:51,778
It wasn’t pulling me ahead, but urging me to flee.

2254
02:20:51,818 --> 02:20:54,658
Why would the magic tell me to run from the test?

2255
02:20:54,658 --> 02:20:58,458
The statue hissed and clawed at me, ripping the sleeve of my
robe.

2256
02:20:58,458 --> 02:21:01,578
Thankfully, it didn’t scratch my skin.

2257
02:21:01,698 --> 02:21:09,658
I leaped backward and tried to force the magic to fling the statue away with a gust of wind, but I couldn’t quite latch
onto the magic.

2258
02:21:09,658 --> 02:21:12,658
It was like trying to grab ahold of a slippery fish.

2259
02:21:12,658 --> 02:21:17,538
The statue creaked as it jumped into the air, stone wings
giving it flight.

2260
02:21:17,578 --> 02:21:20,378
In horror, I realized it wasn’t just a statue.

2261
02:21:20,418 --> 02:21:23,538
It was a gargoyle.

2262
02:21:23,578 --> 02:21:28,938
Any idea of fighting was quickly banished from my mind and I
turned and fled back the way I’d come.

2263
02:21:28,938 --> 02:21:33,058
The wall was still open, and I ran through it and back into
the large square.

2264
02:21:33,058 --> 02:21:35,578
The gargoyle was right behind me.

2265
02:21:35,618 --> 02:21:40,698
I threw myself to the ground and the beast flew narrowly
overhead, its claws swiping at me.

2266
02:21:40,778 --> 02:21:42,858
This wasn’t part of the test.

2267
02:21:42,898 --> 02:21:44,098
It couldn’t be.

2268
02:21:44,098 --> 02:21:50,218
There was no way that Master Pevus nor the Curates would
have allowed such a dangerous creature to be part of the
test.

2269
02:21:50,218 --> 02:21:53,378
A gargoyle was all but undefeatable by someone like me.

2270
02:21:53,378 --> 02:21:55,418
“Help!” I screamed.

2271
02:21:55,418 --> 02:21:58,498
The gargoyle whipped around in the air and came flying back
at me.

2272
02:21:58,618 --> 02:22:06,458
I scrambled to my feet and tried to get out of the way, but the stone creature struck me squarely in the side and I
tumbled to the ground with a cry of pain.

2273
02:22:06,458 --> 02:22:10,338
My ribs were on fire and I was afraid that some of them
might be broken.

2274
02:22:10,338 --> 02:22:12,858
The gargoyle stood over me.

2275
02:22:12,898 --> 02:22:16,578
It flashed a smile at me and then spoke in a gravelly voice.

2276
02:22:16,618 --> 02:22:18,698
“You … die … now.”

2277
02:22:18,698 --> 02:22:23,418
I closed my eyes, not wanting to see what the creature was
going to do.

2278
02:22:23,418 --> 02:22:30,498
There was a fluttering sound, followed by a cracking noise,
and I opened my eyes to see a dragon and its rider.

2279
02:22:30,498 --> 02:22:36,338
The dragon had the gargoyle in its powerful claws and had
snapped it into pieces.

2280
02:22:36,458 --> 02:22:44,058
The dragon tossed the remainder of the gargoyle’s body aside
and gazed down at me, its intelligent eyes looking me over.

2281
02:22:44,098 --> 02:22:50,258
The rider leaped down from the saddle and knelt beside me.
“Are you all right?”

2282
02:22:50,258 --> 02:22:52,218
“Yes,” I said. “Thank you.

2283
02:22:52,218 --> 02:22:55,218
If you hadn’t come just now, I’m sure I’d be dead right
now.”

2284
02:22:55,218 --> 02:22:59,138
“It was a close call, but Azer spotted the danger before you
cried out.

2285
02:22:59,178 --> 02:23:04,018
Dragons have exceptional eyesight, even in the dark, so your
thanks belong to her.”

2286
02:23:04,018 --> 02:23:06,938
I looked at the massive blue dragon. “Thank you.”

2287
02:23:06,938 --> 02:23:09,698
The dragon tilted its head, almost like a human nod.

2288
02:23:09,698 --> 02:23:13,898
“Come on,” the rider said. “Let’s get you out of here.

2289
02:23:13,898 --> 02:23:18,178
Master Pevus will want to know how a gargoyle got into the
testing grounds, I’m sure.”

2290
02:23:18,178 --> 02:23:21,218
The rider helped me to my feet and then climbed into the
saddle.

2291
02:23:21,218 --> 02:23:25,178
I scrambled up the side of the dragon and sat behind the
rider.

2292
02:23:25,178 --> 02:23:28,658
With a powerful flex of its wings, the dragon lifted into
the air.

2293
02:23:28,658 --> 02:23:35,178
I looked down at the gargoyle’s broken body and couldn’t
help but wonder if Josephine was behind the attack.

2294
02:23:35,178 --> 02:23:36,498
CHAPTER SVENTEEN

2295
02:23:36,538 --> 02:23:40,778
I was sitting in a small room outside Master Pevus’s office,
listening to hushed voices.

2296
02:23:40,778 --> 02:23:45,298
The dragoon who had come to my rescue sat across from me,
dozing in and out of sleep.

2297
02:23:45,298 --> 02:23:54,858
After landing outside of the maze, the dragoon had informed Master Pevus what had happened and the remaining tests were
put on hold while the Curates investigated the maze.

2298
02:23:54,898 --> 02:24:02,778
Once the Curates had confirmed there were no other hidden dangers, the tests resumed and Master Pevus ordered the
dragoon and me to follow him.

2299
02:24:02,778 --> 02:24:06,858
A quick check by a healer confirmed my ribs were not broken,
despite the throbbing.

2300
02:24:06,898 --> 02:24:13,898
I feared that I would have to retake my test or, worse, that
I failed since I had called for help.

2301
02:24:13,898 --> 02:24:19,178
The dragoon had said that the gargoyle wasn’t supposed to be
there, so that did ease my fear a little.

2302
02:24:19,218 --> 02:24:22,938
I thought about Maren and wondered if she had heard what
transpired.

2303
02:24:22,938 --> 02:24:26,978
Master Pevus’s door opened and Curate Anesko stepped out and
left.

2304
02:24:26,978 --> 02:24:32,898
“Eldwin,” Master Pevus’s voice echoed into the room.
“Please, come in.”

2305
02:24:33,138 --> 02:24:35,578
I rose from my chair and went stepped through the doorway.

2306
02:24:35,578 --> 02:24:41,378
I’d yet to see the Master’s office and was surprised to find
that it was sparsely decorated.

2307
02:24:41,378 --> 02:24:46,139
There was a desk, which Master Pevus was sitting behind, and
a couple of chairs.

2308
02:24:46,139 --> 02:24:50,459
There were no paintings or anything else to show that the
office was used by anyone.

2309
02:24:50,459 --> 02:24:54,099
“Are you all right?” he asked.

2310
02:24:54,099 --> 02:24:56,099
“Yes, Master.

2311
02:24:56,099 --> 02:25:00,539
A little shaken up, I suppose, but I wasn’t injured too
badly.

2312
02:25:00,539 --> 02:25:02,179
My robes were torn, though.”

2313
02:25:02,179 --> 02:25:03,459
“Good, good.

2314
02:25:03,459 --> 02:25:05,019
We’ll get you another pair.

2315
02:25:05,019 --> 02:25:06,339
I want to apologize to you.

2316
02:25:06,339 --> 02:25:12,139
That creature wasn’t part of the test, nor should it have
been there at all.

2317
02:25:12,139 --> 02:25:18,379
The maze is protected by powerful spells to keep such things
from happening, yet here we find ourselves.

2318
02:25:18,379 --> 02:25:21,139
The Curates checked the spells and they are all intact.

2319
02:25:21,139 --> 02:25:24,619
That leaves only one explanation.”

2320
02:25:24,619 --> 02:25:26,579
I waited for him to continue.

2321
02:25:26,579 --> 02:25:30,339
He rubbed his eyes and leaned forward, folding his arms and
placing them on the desk.

2322
02:25:30,339 --> 02:25:33,139
“Someone put the gargoyle there or allowed it to enter.”

2323
02:25:33,139 --> 02:25:35,819
Was he thinking the same thing I was?

2324
02:25:35,819 --> 02:25:37,299
That Josephine was behind it?

2325
02:25:37,299 --> 02:25:41,179
“When you and Maren told me about your suspicions regarding
Josephine, I didn’t believe it.

2326
02:25:41,179 --> 02:25:42,139
Not at first.

2327
02:25:42,139 --> 02:25:50,459
Some things are happening that I cannot tell you, but I will say that as I considered your allegations, certain things
did seem to fall into place.

2328
02:25:50,459 --> 02:25:53,139
You and Maren are right about Josephine.”

2329
02:25:53,139 --> 02:25:56,019
I felt a rush of relief. “Thank you, Master.

2330
02:25:56,019 --> 02:25:57,499
We weren’t lying.”

2331
02:25:57,539 --> 02:25:58,419
“I see that now.

2332
02:25:58,419 --> 02:26:02,859
I trust you understand why I wouldn’t believe a claim like
that about one of the Curates?”

2333
02:26:02,939 --> 02:26:06,699
“Of course,” I replied. “I didn’t want to believe it
myself.”

2334
02:26:06,699 --> 02:26:10,819
“To make a long tale short, I placed Josephine under Curate
Anesko’s watchful eye.

2335
02:26:10,899 --> 02:26:15,739
He has confirmed that she is spying on us for someone, but
we don’t know who.”

2336
02:26:15,779 --> 02:26:21,819
“Maren said it was the False King,” I said. “but the man
Josephine spoke with was someone different.”

2337
02:26:21,819 --> 02:26:28,019
“Yes, that man is also a servant of the False King, but we
don’t know his identity yet.”

2338
02:26:28,019 --> 02:26:29,299
“I thought he was dead?

2339
02:26:29,299 --> 02:26:30,739
The False King, I mean.”

2340
02:26:30,739 --> 02:26:33,819
Master Pevus sighed. “So did I.

2341
02:26:33,819 --> 02:26:36,979
It seems that may not be the case after all.”

2342
02:26:37,219 --> 02:26:39,579
“What does that mean?” I asked.

2343
02:26:39,579 --> 02:26:41,379
“It means dark times are ahead.

2344
02:26:41,459 --> 02:26:44,859
The False King came very close to achieving his ambitions in
the last war.

2345
02:26:44,859 --> 02:26:52,939
I’m afraid we’ve grown lax in our watchfulness, and it will
be difficult to defeat him a second time.”

2346
02:26:52,939 --> 02:26:59,099
Master Pevus must have noticed my facial expression, for he
waved his hands and stood up.

2347
02:26:59,139 --> 02:27:01,859
“Please, don’t think about such things.

2348
02:27:01,899 --> 02:27:05,779
The Curates and I are already in communication with the king
and his advisors.

2349
02:27:05,819 --> 02:27:09,619
We will sort things out and deal with the False King.

2350
02:27:09,619 --> 02:27:11,379
Now, you should get some rest.

2351
02:27:11,379 --> 02:27:15,419
Due to all of these things and more, we cannot delay the
testing any further.

2352
02:27:15,419 --> 02:27:19,779
Tomorrow, we will conclude the testing and make our
decisions.”

2353
02:27:19,779 --> 02:27:26,339
We left the office and Master Pevus kicked a leg of the
chair the dragoon was sitting in, causing him to startle
awake.

2354
02:27:26,419 --> 02:27:30,699
“Apologies, Master,” he said, standing. “It’s been a long
shift.”

2355
02:27:30,699 --> 02:27:35,699
“I understand,” Master Pevus said, offering a smile. “You
are dismissed.

2356
02:27:35,699 --> 02:27:37,779
Report back to your commander.”

2357
02:27:37,779 --> 02:27:39,819
The dragoon bowed and hurried away.

2358
02:27:39,819 --> 02:27:44,059
“As for you, know that your father would be proud of how
you’ve handled the tests so far.”

2359
02:27:44,059 --> 02:27:49,939
“Thank you,” I said. “I only wish he were here to see it for
himself.”

2360
02:27:49,939 --> 02:27:51,539
“Indeed.”

2361
02:27:51,539 --> 02:27:55,419
I started to leave, then paused and turned to look at Master
Pevus.

2362
02:27:55,419 --> 02:27:57,099
“I have a question.

2363
02:27:57,099 --> 02:28:02,299
Curate Anesko said that the tests would be so hard it would
make us wish we were dead.

2364
02:28:02,819 --> 02:28:08,059
The Magical Aptitude test didn’t seem that difficult, so why
would he say that?”

2365
02:28:08,099 --> 02:28:16,019
Master Pevus tried to keep from smiling but failed. “Curate Anesko likes to exaggerate to weed out any potentials that
might doubt themselves.”

2366
02:28:16,019 --> 02:28:18,219
“That makes sense,” I said.

2367
02:28:18,219 --> 02:28:21,819
“However, you did much better with magic than most everyone
else in your class.

2368
02:28:21,819 --> 02:28:25,859
So, while it may have seemed easy to you, it was not for
many others.”

2369
02:28:25,859 --> 02:28:28,419
Excitement welled within me.

2370
02:28:28,419 --> 02:28:29,859
His words meant I passed!

2371
02:28:29,859 --> 02:28:32,099
At least, that’s how I perceived them.

2372
02:28:32,139 --> 02:28:37,659
Either way, the fact that I had handled the magic so well
could only mean good things in the future.

2373
02:28:37,699 --> 02:28:42,659
“Don’t repeat what we’ve spoken about to anyone,” Master
Pevus said.

2374
02:28:42,659 --> 02:28:43,579
“I won’t.

2375
02:28:43,579 --> 02:28:45,739
Goodnight, Master.”

2376
02:28:45,739 --> 02:28:46,899
“Goodnight, Eldwin.”

2377
02:28:46,899 --> 02:28:51,219
I navigated my way back to my room and realized it was well
after midnight when I climbed into my bed.

2378
02:28:51,259 --> 02:28:55,019
I drifted off to sleep almost immediately.

2379
02:28:55,059 --> 02:28:57,379
When I awoke, one of the bells was ringing.

2380
02:28:57,379 --> 02:29:00,899
I didn’t know which one it was, so I jumped up to get ready.

2381
02:29:00,899 --> 02:29:04,339
I noticed a new robe was folded and set at the edge of my
bed.

2382
02:29:04,379 --> 02:29:10,379
I switched it for the torn one I had fallen asleep in and
hurried down to the dining hall.

2383
02:29:10,379 --> 02:29:13,859
It turned out it was the third bell, signaling breakfast.

2384
02:29:13,859 --> 02:29:17,859
I ate quickly and headed back to my wing to await Curate
Anesko.

2385
02:29:17,859 --> 02:29:19,939
Maren was already there.

2386
02:29:19,939 --> 02:29:22,939
I stood beside her and gave her a tired smile.

2387
02:29:22,939 --> 02:29:24,859
“Late night?” she asked.

2388
02:29:24,859 --> 02:29:27,979
“Too late,” I replied. “Did you hear what happened?”

2389
02:29:27,979 --> 02:29:29,139
“Bits and pieces.

2390
02:29:29,139 --> 02:29:31,099
The Curates were squashing any rumors.”

2391
02:29:31,099 --> 02:29:34,139
“A gargoyle attacked me during the test.”

2392
02:29:34,219 --> 02:29:35,779
“So, that did happen?

2393
02:29:35,779 --> 02:29:36,339
Wow.

2394
02:29:36,339 --> 02:29:37,939
You’re lucky to be alive.”

2395
02:29:37,939 --> 02:29:40,659
“Tell me about it,” I said. “Azer saved my life.”

2396
02:29:40,659 --> 02:29:43,899
“She’s a good dragon,” Maren said. “I like her.

2397
02:29:43,899 --> 02:29:47,419
It’s too bad she’s already bonded, or I’d love to pick her.”

2398
02:29:47,419 --> 02:29:53,619
I leaned in close to her and whispered, “Master Pevus said
he knows we weren’t lying about Josephine.”

2399
02:29:53,619 --> 02:29:56,539
“Really?” she asked eagerly.

2400
02:29:56,579 --> 02:29:57,859
“Yes.

2401
02:29:57,859 --> 02:30:00,939
He had Anesko watch her and he confirmed the same thing.”

2402
02:30:00,979 --> 02:30:03,939
“Well, I heard she hasn’t been seen in the last few hours.

2403
02:30:03,939 --> 02:30:05,739
Dragoons were sent to arrest her.

2404
02:30:05,739 --> 02:30:08,939
They checked her room, but she’s nowhere to be found.”

2405
02:30:08,939 --> 02:30:12,179
“Maybe she fled the school?” I said.

2406
02:30:12,179 --> 02:30:13,739
“I don’t think so.”

2407
02:30:13,739 --> 02:30:15,219
“Where else would she be?”

2408
02:30:15,219 --> 02:30:17,379
“I’m not sure, but I plan on looking for her today.”

2409
02:30:17,379 --> 02:30:20,339
“We have our last test today,” I said.

2410
02:30:20,339 --> 02:30:20,739
“I know.

2411
02:30:20,739 --> 02:30:23,699
I’m going to sneak off and come back before it’s my turn.”

2412
02:30:23,699 --> 02:30:26,979
“Maren.” I stared at her. “You won’t know when it’s your
turn.

2413
02:30:26,979 --> 02:30:32,139
You’re likely to be late and then …” I trailed off when I
saw the hardness in her eyes.

2414
02:30:32,139 --> 02:30:34,219
She’d already made her decision.

2415
02:30:34,219 --> 02:30:42,179
“I’m not asking you to come with me,” Maren said. “I only want to look around and see if I can find any sign of where
she’s gone, then I’ll let Master Pevus know.”

2416
02:30:42,219 --> 02:30:45,539
“What about our date?” I asked, changing the subject.

2417
02:30:45,579 --> 02:30:48,059
Maren laughed. “Did you think I forgot?

2418
02:30:48,059 --> 02:30:52,379
Just because it didn’t happen yesterday doesn’t mean it
won’t happen at all.”

2419
02:30:52,379 --> 02:30:54,179
“Fair enough,” I replied.

2420
02:30:54,179 --> 02:30:56,179
Curate Anesko joined our group.

2421
02:30:56,259 --> 02:30:59,339
For the first time since I’d been here, he looked tired.

2422
02:30:59,419 --> 02:31:03,339
His eyes had small puffy bags under them and he stifled a
yawn.

2423
02:31:03,379 --> 02:31:04,979
“Today is the final test.

2424
02:31:04,979 --> 02:31:08,019
If you are still here, you’ve passed the first two.

2425
02:31:08,059 --> 02:31:10,339
You’ll notice that some of you are missing.

2426
02:31:10,339 --> 02:31:13,299
They’ve failed and been excused from the school.”

2427
02:31:13,299 --> 02:31:15,139
I looked around.

2428
02:31:15,179 --> 02:31:17,419
Anesko wasn’t lying.

2429
02:31:17,459 --> 02:31:19,739
At least a third of our group was absent.

2430
02:31:19,779 --> 02:31:21,539
I exchanged glances with Maren.

2431
02:31:21,539 --> 02:31:23,019
“Strength and Arms.

2432
02:31:23,059 --> 02:31:25,459
That is what today’s test will entail.

2433
02:31:25,459 --> 02:31:32,099
If you want to be a dragon rider, you must prove you have
the strength and that you are capable with a weapon.

2434
02:31:32,099 --> 02:31:37,259
There will be several parts to this test, including armed
combat against another student.

2435
02:31:37,299 --> 02:31:40,819
Today will determine if you will be here tomorrow.

2436
02:31:40,859 --> 02:31:43,219
Prepare yourselves for what’s to come.

2437
02:31:43,259 --> 02:31:44,419
Follow me.”

2438
02:31:44,419 --> 02:31:49,139
We followed Anesko out of the school and to the opposite
side of the Citadel we’d been on yesterday.

2439
02:31:49,139 --> 02:31:53,499
Master Pevus and the other Curates were there waiting.

2440
02:31:53,499 --> 02:31:59,859
I wondered how Master Pevus was able to function off so
little sleep, but I guessed he must be used to it.

2441
02:31:59,859 --> 02:32:04,059
Tree branches, all thick and heavy looking, were set in a
pile.

2442
02:32:04,099 --> 02:32:12,659
As soon as we had gathered around it, Master Pevus pointed at the branches and said, “Grab one and take a lap around
the city of Autumnwick.”

2443
02:32:12,659 --> 02:32:15,059
I looked at Maren in uncertainty.

2444
02:32:15,059 --> 02:32:15,899
She shrugged.

2445
02:32:15,899 --> 02:32:18,659
That sounded easy compared to everything else we’d been
through.

2446
02:32:18,659 --> 02:32:23,419
None of us moved, obviously waiting for the rest of his
instructions.

2447
02:32:23,419 --> 02:32:25,379
“Well, what are you waiting for?

2448
02:32:25,379 --> 02:32:26,339
Go!”

2449
02:32:26,339 --> 02:32:33,980
I rushed forward and grabbed a branch and hefted it onto my
shoulders, then ran for the gate that led to the city.

2450
02:32:33,980 --> 02:32:38,980
The branch was heavier than it looked, and my muscles were
already crying out in protest.

2451
02:32:38,980 --> 02:32:42,060
Perhaps this wouldn’t be as easy as I thought.

2452
02:32:42,140 --> 02:32:43,340
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

2453
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:51,020
By the time I’d made it around the entire city and arrived
back at the Citadel, I was ready to collapse from
exhaustion.

2454
02:32:51,020 --> 02:32:54,580
The lack of sleep from the night before wasn’t helping
either.

2455
02:32:54,580 --> 02:32:57,940
Maren jogged in shortly after me, and her face was flushed
red.

2456
02:32:57,940 --> 02:33:00,860
A layer of sweat glistened on her forehead.

2457
02:33:00,940 --> 02:33:06,900
She dropped the branch and bent forward, placing her hands
on her knees and heaved in deep breathes.

2458
02:33:06,900 --> 02:33:09,700
I retrieved a water skin and brought it to her.

2459
02:33:09,700 --> 02:33:11,460
“Thank you,” she huffed.

2460
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:15,020
She drank deeply and handed the skin back to me.

2461
02:33:15,020 --> 02:33:17,180
“You all right?” I asked.

2462
02:33:17,180 --> 02:33:22,060
“I’m fine,” she replied. “Just didn’t expect that first
thing in the morning.”

2463
02:33:22,060 --> 02:33:23,940
“Tell me about it,” I said.

2464
02:33:23,940 --> 02:33:34,420
“What are you stopping for?” Curate Anesko said. “The next obstacle is ahead.” He pointed to a wooden wall that had
been erected with ropes hanging down from the top of it. “Climb without using your legs!”

2465
02:33:34,420 --> 02:33:38,020
I gawked at Anesko, but if he saw my look, he ignored it.

2466
02:33:38,020 --> 02:33:43,940
I shook my head in disbelief and ran over to the wall and
grabbed onto one of the ropes.

2467
02:33:43,940 --> 02:33:50,820
My mangled hand could grip the rope, but I wasn’t sure if my
arm had the strength to lift my bodyweight that far.

2468
02:33:50,860 --> 02:33:54,220
The wall was at least three times my height.

2469
02:33:54,220 --> 02:33:57,420
“You can do this,” Maren said from beside me.

2470
02:33:57,420 --> 02:34:03,180
Her encouraging words lit a fire inside me and I began
pulling myself up with only my arms.

2471
02:34:03,220 --> 02:34:06,940
To say it was the hardest thing I’d ever done was an
understatement.

2472
02:34:06,940 --> 02:34:10,420
I kept sliding down and burning my hands on the rope.

2473
02:34:10,540 --> 02:34:12,820
For every foot I gained, I lost two.

2474
02:34:12,820 --> 02:34:17,660
A frustrated glance around me showed everyone was
struggling, but not nearly as bad as I was.

2475
02:34:17,660 --> 02:34:22,700
My hands were blistered raw and bleeding, and my arms were
burning intensely.

2476
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:27,900
I hung in place and my arms were shaking so much I thought
about just giving up.

2477
02:34:27,940 --> 02:34:31,020
And then I reminded myself that if I failed, I had nothing.

2478
02:34:31,020 --> 02:34:37,740
I heaved in a deep breath and then pushed myself further
than I thought possible and struggled up the rope.

2479
02:34:37,780 --> 02:34:40,700
I was the last one to reach the top, but I made it.

2480
02:34:40,700 --> 02:34:44,060
I scrambled down the other side and followed after the
others.

2481
02:34:44,060 --> 02:34:51,740
One of the Curates was directing us into a long trench
filled with mud.

2482
02:34:51,740 --> 02:34:56,100
Since I was last in line, I was able to see that it was deep
enough that it would reach my chest.

2483
02:34:56,140 --> 02:35:00,980
When it was my turn, I leaped into the trench, splashing
into the mud.

2484
02:35:01,020 --> 02:35:04,380
It quickly became obvious that it was difficult to move
through.

2485
02:35:04,380 --> 02:35:08,500
I was so exhausted I wasn’t sure if I would make it to the
end before I passed out.

2486
02:35:08,580 --> 02:35:14,980
Everything became a desperate blur and the next thing I knew I was lying at the other end of the trench staring into the
sky.

2487
02:35:15,020 --> 02:35:17,940
My robes were caked with mud and weighed heavily on me.

2488
02:35:17,940 --> 02:35:21,060
All I wanted to do was close my eyes and sleep.

2489
02:35:21,100 --> 02:35:26,100
Maren’s face appeared above me and she offered her hand.

2490
02:35:26,100 --> 02:35:29,540
I clasped her wrist and she pulled me to my feet.

2491
02:35:29,580 --> 02:35:32,380
“Is it over yet?” I asked.

2492
02:35:32,460 --> 02:35:37,060
“Not even close,” Maren replied. “But it sounds like this
was the hardest portion.

2493
02:35:37,060 --> 02:35:39,220
Next are some exercises with weapons.”

2494
02:35:39,220 --> 02:35:40,540
“That’s great to hear.

2495
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:42,020
I can do weapons.”

2496
02:35:42,020 --> 02:35:45,460
We walked together to where Master Pevus and the Curates
were waiting.

2497
02:35:45,460 --> 02:35:50,220
The other students were gathered around them in a circle,
some kneeling and others lying on the ground.

2498
02:35:50,220 --> 02:35:55,180
“Everyone has done well so far, but now the easy work is
over,” Curate Anesko said.

2499
02:35:55,180 --> 02:36:02,340
Master Pevus tried to hide his grin, but I saw it and
remembered his words from the night before.

2500
02:36:02,380 --> 02:36:05,180
“The remainder of the day will consist of armed combat.

2501
02:36:05,180 --> 02:36:07,540
You will each be paired with a senior student.

2502
02:36:07,540 --> 02:36:15,820
Real weapons will be employed, but we have healers standing
by in the event anyone is grievously wounded.”

2503
02:36:15,860 --> 02:36:20,020
Anesko turned full circle slowly, looking at everyone that
remained.

2504
02:36:20,060 --> 02:36:25,740
“Let me say this: if you are injured to the point a healer
is needed, you have failed.

2505
02:36:25,740 --> 02:36:38,220
We don’t expect you to beat your opponent, as most of you likely won’t, but we do expect you to hold your own in a
fight and show that you’re able to handle a weapon without chopping your leg off.

2506
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:43,260
If anyone has any hesitation about their abilities, please
speak up now.”

2507
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:47,940
I watched those near me to see if anyone was going to
forfeit the last test, but no one did.

2508
02:36:47,940 --> 02:36:56,780
A makeshift arena had been set up, with a circular enclosure
for the combatants to fight inside and seating around it for everyone to watch.

2509
02:36:56,780 --> 02:37:03,700
Knowing that everyone would be watching me fight made me a
little uneasy, but I supposed everyone felt that way.

2510
02:37:03,700 --> 02:37:06,860
The matches started much like the other tests.

2511
02:37:06,860 --> 02:37:14,540
A student was called by name and told what to do, then outfitted in a chainmail shirt and given a sword of their
choice from a small rack.

2512
02:37:14,540 --> 02:37:20,220
The idea of using my father’s sword was great, but I doubted
they would allow me that privilege.

2513
02:37:20,220 --> 02:37:27,820
I took a seat next to Maren and watched as the first student
walked into the enclosure.

2514
02:37:27,900 --> 02:37:33,660
The senior student he was up against was also wearing a
chainmail shirt and held his sword with practiced ease.

2515
02:37:33,660 --> 02:37:42,180
One of the Curates rang a bell and the two combatants circled each other, offering a jab here and there to test
one another’s defenses.

2516
02:37:42,220 --> 02:37:46,820
I began formulating tactics for how I hoped my test would
go.

2517
02:37:46,820 --> 02:37:52,260
After a few more circles around each other, the two clashed
in a heated battle.

2518
02:37:52,300 --> 02:37:59,700
I watched every move of the senior student intently, curious to know his style and compare it to the other senior
students as the matches continued.

2519
02:37:59,740 --> 02:38:02,420
I wanted to have an edge over my fellows and possibly win my
match.

2520
02:38:02,420 --> 02:38:12,020
As the senior student whirled around and slashed his blade across the chest of his opponent, I realized that it was
highly unlikely I would be able to win.

2521
02:38:12,020 --> 02:38:18,740
If it weren’t for the chainmail shirt, the student would
have received a deep life-threatening gash in his chest.

2522
02:38:18,740 --> 02:38:24,220
“The opponents we face are probably going to make us look
like children with sticks,” I said to Maren.

2523
02:38:24,260 --> 02:38:30,700
“I learned how to defend myself from the captain of my
father’s guard,” Maren replied. “I’m sure I can hold my own.

2524
02:38:30,700 --> 02:38:33,100
How long do you think each match will take?”

2525
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:36,220
I shrugged. “If they all go like this one, probably not
long.

2526
02:38:36,380 --> 02:38:37,140
Why?”

2527
02:38:37,140 --> 02:38:41,780
Maren looked toward the gate that led to the city and I
suspected I knew what she was thinking.

2528
02:38:41,780 --> 02:38:43,980
She looked back at me and frowned.

2529
02:38:43,980 --> 02:38:46,660
“I have a feeling that Josephine is still here,” she said.

2530
02:38:46,660 --> 02:38:49,980
“I’m sure she is, but you promised to stay out of trouble.”

2531
02:38:49,980 --> 02:38:58,940
“I know, but …” Maren looked toward the city again. “There’s something I can’t explain that’s telling me I need to find
her.

2532
02:38:58,980 --> 02:39:02,180
I think the elderly woman is still alive.”

2533
02:39:02,220 --> 02:39:11,860
I bit my lip and considered telling her to go, but I knew that if she were caught leaving or wasn’t back in time, her
chance at proving herself worthy of being a dragon rider would be gone.

2534
02:39:11,900 --> 02:39:16,820
“Just wait until after the test and I’ll go with you,” I
said. “It’ll be our date.”

2535
02:39:16,820 --> 02:39:20,340
Maren didn’t reply, but she didn’t leave, either.

2536
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:23,700
I turned my attention back to the enclosure and watched the
next match.

2537
02:39:23,740 --> 02:39:26,260
It was one of the nobles who’d hung around with Simon.

2538
02:39:26,300 --> 02:39:30,740
He lasted a little longer than the first student, but he too
lost his match.

2539
02:39:30,740 --> 02:39:35,580
The next five matches were all the same, but the sixth ended
up being a lot bloodier.

2540
02:39:35,620 --> 02:39:39,860
A student who had probably never touched a sword had his
hand cut almost in half.

2541
02:39:39,860 --> 02:39:47,500
The healers were able to mend it quickly, but the student was shaken and was escorted from the enclosure by one of the
Curates.

2542
02:39:47,540 --> 02:39:54,780
A portion of the sand inside the enclosure was stained with the student’s blood, a reminder that this test was the most
physically dangerous.

2543
02:39:54,780 --> 02:40:02,860
Despite the presence of the healers, I found it almost barbaric to allow such brutality as part of a test to join
the school.

2544
02:40:02,980 --> 02:40:11,860
Then again, those who passed would be trained for combat, riding dragons into battle and probably seeing more brutal
things than what this test offered.

2545
02:40:11,860 --> 02:40:12,780
Still.

2546
02:40:12,780 --> 02:40:16,580
“Does your father know what goes on here?” I asked.

2547
02:40:16,580 --> 02:40:23,141
“I’m sure he does,” Maren replied. “He considers the
dragoons to be the most powerful part of his army.

2548
02:40:23,141 --> 02:40:28,541
He also knows, like everyone else, that becoming a dragoon
is far from easy.”

2549
02:40:28,541 --> 02:40:31,221
“That makes sense,” I said.

2550
02:40:31,221 --> 02:40:34,101
The next student was preparing to enter the enclosure.

2551
02:40:34,101 --> 02:40:37,261
So far, there had been a different senior student for each
match.

2552
02:40:37,261 --> 02:40:42,461
“I wonder how many of these senior students have seen a real
battle,” I said.

2553
02:40:42,461 --> 02:40:45,181
Maren didn’t reply, so I turned to look at her.

2554
02:40:45,181 --> 02:40:46,341
She was gone.

2555
02:40:46,381 --> 02:40:47,701
CHAPTER NINETEEN

2556
02:40:47,701 --> 02:40:50,661
It only took me a moment to decide that I needed to follow
her.

2557
02:40:50,661 --> 02:41:00,541
She couldn’t have gotten very far, so I waited until the match started and I was certain Master Pevus and the Curates
weren’t paying attention to anything except the battling students.

2558
02:41:00,541 --> 02:41:05,621
I jogged toward the gate that led to the city, pausing to
glance around the grounds of the Citadel.

2559
02:41:05,661 --> 02:41:10,461
Maren was nowhere to be seen, but I wasn’t entirely sure
that she had planned to search the city for Josephine.

2560
02:41:10,461 --> 02:41:16,701
It would make sense that Josephine would hide in the city
rather than within the Citadel somewhere, though.

2561
02:41:16,701 --> 02:41:19,981
With a final scan of the area, I stepped through the gate
and into the city.

2562
02:41:20,061 --> 02:41:24,981
There were a few empty buildings adjacent to the wall that
surrounded the Citadel.

2563
02:41:24,981 --> 02:41:28,181
They appeared to have once been used for warehouse space.

2564
02:41:28,181 --> 02:41:30,701
A single smaller building was across from them.

2565
02:41:30,701 --> 02:41:36,821
I was going to continue further into the city, but I noticed
that the side door of the lone building was cracked open.

2566
02:41:36,981 --> 02:41:43,381
It could have been nothing relevant, but I decided it was
better to check and be sure than to possibly miss something.

2567
02:41:43,381 --> 02:41:46,701
I walked closer and heard sounds within.

2568
02:41:46,741 --> 02:41:48,861
There was a muffled cry, then silence.

2569
02:41:48,901 --> 02:41:51,221
I grew nervous as I got closer to the door.

2570
02:41:51,221 --> 02:41:55,421
If Josephine and Maren were in there, what help would I be?

2571
02:41:55,461 --> 02:41:58,901
I wasn’t a sorcerer and I didn’t know how to fight one,
either.

2572
02:41:58,901 --> 02:42:02,101
But if I ran to get help, it could be too late for Maren.

2573
02:42:02,141 --> 02:42:04,621
I swallowed hard and slipped inside the building.

2574
02:42:04,621 --> 02:42:10,501
There were plenty of windows, but the wall towered high
enough that it blocked most of the natural light.

2575
02:42:10,501 --> 02:42:14,101
It wasn’t dark, but it was dim enough that it gave me pause.

2576
02:42:14,141 --> 02:42:20,701
There was a long corridor with doors on either side, but at
the end of the corridor, it opened up into a large room.

2577
02:42:20,741 --> 02:42:27,741
My palms were getting sweaty and I wiped them on my robes, which only made things worse because of the mud on the
garment.

2578
02:42:27,741 --> 02:42:32,461
Moving as quietly as I could, I headed for the large room at
the end.

2579
02:42:32,501 --> 02:42:34,661
I heard movement and stopped mid-step.

2580
02:42:34,661 --> 02:42:38,141
Someone was talking, but it was low and I couldn’t make out
the words.

2581
02:42:38,141 --> 02:42:40,221
I risked a glance and saw all I needed to.

2582
02:42:40,261 --> 02:42:45,341
The elderly woman that had been bound in Josephine’s room
was on the floor, curled into a ball.

2583
02:42:45,381 --> 02:42:48,341
Her eyes were closed, but she was breathing.

2584
02:42:48,341 --> 02:42:50,261
And next to her was Maren.

2585
02:42:50,261 --> 02:42:52,141
I ground my teeth in anger.

2586
02:42:52,141 --> 02:42:59,061
Maren’s arms were bound behind her back and she was sitting
on her knees, a roll of cloth in her mouth.

2587
02:42:59,061 --> 02:43:02,181
Pacing back and forth anxiously was Josephine.

2588
02:43:02,221 --> 02:43:05,901
I leaned back against the wall, trying to figure out what I
should do.

2589
02:43:05,941 --> 02:43:15,581
“I can kill them both right now,” Josephine said, talking aloud to herself as she paced. “No one will ever find their
bodies, but how do I avoid suspicion?

2590
02:43:15,581 --> 02:43:18,341
That is the problem.”

2591
02:43:18,381 --> 02:43:24,981
By the way she was conversing, it sounded like she was
trying to talk herself into committing the deed.

2592
02:43:25,021 --> 02:43:27,621
Perhaps she had more of a conscience than I knew.

2593
02:43:27,661 --> 02:43:33,141
And if she wasn’t completely set on the course, maybe I
could say something to keep her from hurting them?

2594
02:43:33,141 --> 02:43:35,341
What could I say, though?

2595
02:43:35,341 --> 02:43:41,701
I didn’t get much time to think about it, because Josephine paced past the opening of the corridor and stopped when she
saw me.

2596
02:43:41,701 --> 02:43:49,461
Her eyes widened briefly, then she stepped behind Maren, lifted her to her feet, and pressed a wicked-looking dagger
to Maren’s throat.

2597
02:43:49,461 --> 02:43:51,581
“Don’t move,” Josephine snapped.

2598
02:43:51,581 --> 02:43:57,301
I raised my hands in front of me, palms toward her. “I’m not
armed,” I informed her.

2599
02:43:57,301 --> 02:44:02,421
“I don’t believe you,” Josephine said, narrowing her eyes at
me. “Who did you bring with you?”

2600
02:44:02,421 --> 02:44:06,181
“Nobody,” I replied. “And I’m not lying.

2601
02:44:06,181 --> 02:44:07,781
I don’t have any weapons.”

2602
02:44:07,781 --> 02:44:09,581
“How did you find me?”

2603
02:44:09,581 --> 02:44:13,141
“By accident … but the open door of the building was a good
clue.”

2604
02:44:13,141 --> 02:44:20,781
Josephine scowled and pushed the blade harder against
Maren’s skin, cutting a small line that bled a little.

2605
02:44:20,941 --> 02:44:25,061
Anger was boiling within me, but I refused to do anything
rash.

2606
02:44:25,061 --> 02:44:29,621
“You don’t have to do this,” I said. “Just let them go.”

2607
02:44:29,621 --> 02:44:33,261
“You don’t understand,” Josephine said. “I must do this.”

2608
02:44:33,261 --> 02:44:34,061
“Why?

2609
02:44:34,061 --> 02:44:36,741
Because that man told you to?”

2610
02:44:36,741 --> 02:44:38,381
“What do you know of him?”

2611
02:44:38,381 --> 02:44:42,101
“Nothing,” I said. “Other than the fact that he radiates
evil.”

2612
02:44:42,101 --> 02:44:43,061
“He is evil.

2613
02:44:43,061 --> 02:44:45,541
If I don’t do this, he’ll kill me.”

2614
02:44:45,541 --> 02:44:51,381
“Not if he can’t find you,” I said. “Turn yourself into
Master Pevus and I’m sure he will help you.”

2615
02:44:51,381 --> 02:44:52,501
Josephine laughed.

2616
02:44:52,501 --> 02:44:59,421
It bordered on maniacal and helpless all at once. “Pevus
will be dead before long, and he won’t be able to help
anyone.

2617
02:44:59,421 --> 02:45:01,461
No, no one can help me.

2618
02:45:01,461 --> 02:45:05,421
I will do this and prove my loyalty to the Necromancer.”

2619
02:45:05,421 --> 02:45:07,261
So that’s what people called him?

2620
02:45:07,301 --> 02:45:08,501
I wondered what it meant.

2621
02:45:08,501 --> 02:45:11,701
If we made it out of this predicament, I was going to ask
Maren.

2622
02:45:11,701 --> 02:45:12,741
“What for?

2623
02:45:12,741 --> 02:45:17,221
You murder two innocent people to prove to someone that you
are no better than he is?

2624
02:45:17,221 --> 02:45:18,941
Please, Josephine.

2625
02:45:18,981 --> 02:45:20,621
Think about this.”

2626
02:45:20,661 --> 02:45:26,341
“I’ve thought plenty about this!” Josephine growled. “There
is no other way!

2627
02:45:26,341 --> 02:45:29,101
It’s either follow his orders or die.”

2628
02:45:29,181 --> 02:45:30,821
I felt utterly helpless.

2629
02:45:30,821 --> 02:45:38,861
My arguments weren’t seeming to sway the Curate at all, and she seemed so afraid of the Necromancer that she felt she
had no other options.

2630
02:45:38,861 --> 02:45:43,421
I did the only thing I could do.

2631
02:45:43,421 --> 02:45:44,981
I begged.

2632
02:45:44,981 --> 02:45:46,261
“Please.”

2633
02:45:46,261 --> 02:45:47,541
Josephine stared at me.

2634
02:45:47,541 --> 02:45:56,381
I didn’t know if sorcerers could read thoughts, but I projected everything I could into my mind that I couldn’t
put into words and hoped she would understand.

2635
02:45:56,381 --> 02:46:01,821
Whether or not that’s what did it, I didn’t know, but she
lowered the blade slightly.

2636
02:46:01,821 --> 02:46:03,901
“She’s your friend,” Josephine said.

2637
02:46:03,901 --> 02:46:04,941
“Yes.”

2638
02:46:04,941 --> 02:46:08,461
“And you came here to help her even though you had no way to
fight me?”

2639
02:46:08,461 --> 02:46:10,861
“Yes,” I said again.

2640
02:46:10,861 --> 02:46:17,741
There was a lump growing in my throat, but I swallowed hard and tried not to let it break my voice, but the tremor was
obvious.

2641
02:46:17,741 --> 02:46:20,741
The silence stretched into what felt like an eternity.

2642
02:46:20,741 --> 02:46:25,501
I started to worry that Josephine was going to ignore my
plea.

2643
02:46:25,581 --> 02:46:29,341
Maren was looking at me, so I held her gaze with my own.

2644
02:46:29,381 --> 02:46:32,421
Whatever happened, at least neither of us was alone.

2645
02:46:32,461 --> 02:46:36,421
“Maybe if I had …” Josephine started to say, then trailed
off.

2646
02:46:36,461 --> 02:46:40,901
Her eyes hardened, then they became watery, filling with
tears.

2647
02:46:40,901 --> 02:46:43,741
“Go,” she hissed, pushing Maren toward me.

2648
02:46:43,821 --> 02:46:45,621
Maren staggered and fell.

2649
02:46:45,621 --> 02:46:49,141
I slowly knelt and helped her up, keeping my eyes on
Josephine.

2650
02:46:49,221 --> 02:46:54,141
She watched me quietly, but I could still see the turmoil on
her face.

2651
02:46:54,141 --> 02:46:56,821
“Come with us to Master Pevus,” I said.

2652
02:46:56,821 --> 02:46:59,501
“Go,” she repeated, her tone dangerous.

2653
02:46:59,501 --> 02:47:03,181
I nodded and helped Maren to her feet and removed the cloth
from her mouth.

2654
02:47:03,181 --> 02:47:08,661
The elderly woman was still asleep, and when I stepped
toward her, Josephine raised the dagger at me.

2655
02:47:08,661 --> 02:47:12,021
I backed away and grabbed Maren’s hand, pulling her with me.

2656
02:47:12,061 --> 02:47:15,901
“We have to help the woman,” Maren protested.

2657
02:47:15,901 --> 02:47:20,381
“We’ll come back for her,” I whispered. “With Master Pevus.”

2658
02:47:20,381 --> 02:47:22,301
That seemed to ease Maren’s hesitation.

2659
02:47:22,501 --> 02:47:24,341
We hurried along the corridor to the door.

2660
02:47:24,341 --> 02:47:29,701
I tried to untie the ropes around Maren’s wrists, but it was
difficult to do while we were moving.

2661
02:47:29,701 --> 02:47:32,661
I pushed Maren through the doorway and looked back.

2662
02:47:32,701 --> 02:47:34,061
Josephine was still there.

2663
02:47:34,101 --> 02:47:35,981
She hadn’t tried to stop us.

2664
02:47:35,981 --> 02:47:42,941
The elderly woman was still her prisoner, but I was confident we could reach Master Pevus before Josephine
escaped with her.

2665
02:47:42,941 --> 02:47:44,781
She wouldn’t kill the woman.

2666
02:47:44,781 --> 02:47:46,341
I knew she wouldn’t.

2667
02:47:46,341 --> 02:47:48,501
She was too conflicted with herself to do it.

2668
02:47:48,501 --> 02:47:51,661
As I was about to close the door, Josephine lifted the
dagger.

2669
02:47:51,661 --> 02:47:54,701
I stopped, too horrified to look away.

2670
02:47:54,741 --> 02:47:58,141
The Curate drove the dagger down, into her own chest.

2671
02:47:58,141 --> 02:48:02,821
I slammed the door closed and cried out, pulling Maren
toward the Citadel.

2672
02:48:02,861 --> 02:48:04,501
I couldn’t believe my eyes.

2673
02:48:04,621 --> 02:48:06,581
Josephine had stabbed herself.

2674
02:48:06,621 --> 02:48:08,901
Why would she do such a thing?

2675
02:48:08,901 --> 02:48:13,182
“What happened?” Maren asked, still struggling to get free
of her bonds.

2676
02:48:13,222 --> 02:48:16,542
I wanted to tell her, but the words wouldn’t come out of my
mouth.

2677
02:48:16,542 --> 02:48:21,022
My throat was constricted tight and it was all I could do to
breathe.

2678
02:48:21,022 --> 02:48:26,062
We made it back to where the others were, and Maren shouted
to get someone’s attention.

2679
02:48:26,062 --> 02:48:28,462
Everything became a blur for me.

2680
02:48:28,462 --> 02:48:35,662
The stress of the day, the physical and mental exhaustion,
everything weighed on me and I collapsed near the stands.

2681
02:48:35,662 --> 02:48:37,102
Maren screamed.

2682
02:48:37,102 --> 02:48:41,662
I didn’t know if anyone heard her over the commotion of
ringing steel.

2683
02:48:41,662 --> 02:48:42,542
I didn’t care.

2684
02:48:42,542 --> 02:48:50,582
I had experienced death before, but this was something different, something so heavy that I didn’t know how I would
bear it.

2685
02:48:50,582 --> 02:48:57,182
“Are you all right?” I recognized Master Pevus’s voice, but
it sounded far away. “What happened?”

2686
02:48:57,182 --> 02:49:01,822
I pointed toward the way we’d come. “Josephine,” I gasped.
“She’s dead.”

2687
02:49:01,822 --> 02:49:02,782
CHAPTER TWENTY

2688
02:49:02,822 --> 02:49:06,422
I didn’t know how much time had passed when the storm of
emotions finally passed.

2689
02:49:06,422 --> 02:49:15,542
Maren had stayed with me almost the entire time, aside from her test, holding my mangled hand and occasionally
whispering soft words or making soothing sounds.

2690
02:49:15,582 --> 02:49:21,902
We sat in the stands and I was vaguely aware of the other
students staring at me and whispering to one another.

2691
02:49:21,942 --> 02:49:26,182
“Let them wonder,” Maren said. “You don’t have to tell them
anything.”

2692
02:49:26,182 --> 02:49:28,822
I wouldn’t tell them, even if they begged to know.

2693
02:49:28,862 --> 02:49:30,982
No one needed that knowledge, that pain.

2694
02:49:30,982 --> 02:49:33,702
Eventually, Master Pevus came to sit with us.

2695
02:49:33,702 --> 02:49:37,542
The other students finished their testing, but I barely
heard any of the noise.

2696
02:49:37,582 --> 02:49:47,062
“Death is not an easy thing to witness,” Master Pevus said.
“Especially a death as tragic as Josephine’s.”

2697
02:49:47,062 --> 02:49:49,622
“I don’t understand it,” I whispered.

2698
02:49:49,622 --> 02:49:50,742
“Neither do I.

2699
02:49:50,742 --> 02:49:51,742
Not fully.”

2700
02:49:51,742 --> 02:49:54,062
Master Pevus stared at the enclosure quietly.

2701
02:49:54,062 --> 02:49:58,262
I started to feel a little more normal, though I was
exhausted.

2702
02:49:58,262 --> 02:50:02,982
Everything felt dreamlike, and for a moment I wondered if
any of it had even really happened.

2703
02:50:02,982 --> 02:50:10,302
“Do you think you can take the test?” Master Pevus asked. “I can try to push it back, but the decision is not mine
alone.”

2704
02:50:10,302 --> 02:50:13,222
“What do you mean?” Maren asked.

2705
02:50:13,222 --> 02:50:17,702
“The council here at the Citadel is only one of many, and we
all report to the Conclave.

2706
02:50:17,702 --> 02:50:23,822
We have orders that the testing must be completed today, but
I can send a letter requesting more time.”

2707
02:50:23,822 --> 02:50:25,782
“No,” I finally spoke.

2708
02:50:25,782 --> 02:50:32,862
My throat was dry, so it sounded more like a croaking noise.
“No,” I repeated. “I will take the test.”

2709
02:50:32,862 --> 02:50:39,542
“Eldwin,” Maren said, squeezing my hand. “You need some
rest.”

2710
02:50:39,542 --> 02:50:41,142
“No, I’m fine.

2711
02:50:41,142 --> 02:50:41,902
I can do it.

2712
02:50:41,942 --> 02:50:43,062
I need to do it.”

2713
02:50:43,062 --> 02:50:49,582
Master Pevus seemed like he was about to object, but he
bowed his head and stood up. “Let us get you ready, then.”

2714
02:50:49,622 --> 02:50:54,062
I stood up and followed Master Pevus around the enclosure to
where the racks of armor and weapons were.

2715
02:50:54,062 --> 02:50:57,502
Curate Anesko was there and he helped me put a chainmail
shirt on.

2716
02:50:57,502 --> 02:51:01,462
Some of the other students came out of the Citadel and
joined Maren in the stands.

2717
02:51:01,462 --> 02:51:05,702
I didn’t know why they wanted to watch my test, but I
ignored them.

2718
02:51:05,702 --> 02:51:08,662
I hoped the test would take my mind off everything else.

2719
02:51:08,662 --> 02:51:13,382
Anesko handed me a helm and I slipped it onto my head, then
stared at the rack of weapons.

2720
02:51:13,382 --> 02:51:17,942
There were numerous swords, a few axes, and a single mace.

2721
02:51:17,942 --> 02:51:24,382
I chose a blade that was closest to the size and heft of my
father’s sword and nodded at Anesko.

2722
02:51:24,502 --> 02:51:27,822
He led me into the enclosure and said, “Good luck.

2723
02:51:27,822 --> 02:51:30,502
Sebastian is one of the best.”

2724
02:51:30,502 --> 02:51:37,382
I assumed he was trying to make me second guess myself, so I
didn’t pay his last comment any attention.

2725
02:51:37,422 --> 02:51:41,582
On the other side of the circular battleground was my
opponent, Sebastian.

2726
02:51:41,622 --> 02:51:46,822
It was impossible to tell if I’d seen him before because he
was wearing a helm with a visor.

2727
02:51:46,862 --> 02:51:50,262
I took a few practice swings, stretching my muscles.

2728
02:51:50,302 --> 02:51:51,222
This was it.

2729
02:51:51,222 --> 02:51:52,262
My final test.

2730
02:51:52,262 --> 02:51:55,142
The defining moment that would determine my future.

2731
02:51:55,142 --> 02:52:00,942
I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, then rolled my
shoulders and prepared for the bell to ring.

2732
02:52:00,942 --> 02:52:04,182
A few moments later, the clang echoed across the
battleground.

2733
02:52:04,222 --> 02:52:07,942
I stalked forward slowly, watching Sebastian’s posture.

2734
02:52:07,942 --> 02:52:12,342
He moved with confidence and the ease of a skilled warrior.

2735
02:52:12,342 --> 02:52:15,782
Perhaps Anesko’s comment wasn’t entirely exaggerated.

2736
02:52:15,822 --> 02:52:20,342
We circled one another like giant hunting cats, prepared to
pounce at any moment.

2737
02:52:20,422 --> 02:52:22,462
Sebastian made the first move.

2738
02:52:22,462 --> 02:52:26,862
He rushed me and swung his sword horizontally, trying to
strike me in the chest.

2739
02:52:26,902 --> 02:52:29,062
I lifted my blade and blocked it.

2740
02:52:29,062 --> 02:52:30,942
The blades clanged together loudly.

2741
02:52:30,982 --> 02:52:35,662
I was surprised at Sebastian’s strength and almost lost my
grip on the hilt.

2742
02:52:35,702 --> 02:52:39,582
Although my right arm was shriveled compared to my left, I
was right-handed.

2743
02:52:39,582 --> 02:52:44,822
I’d tried a few times to use my left arm more, but it felt
awkward and unnatural.

2744
02:52:44,822 --> 02:52:52,342
It quickly became evident as Sebastian struck again and
again that my right arm could not hold up under the
onslaught.

2745
02:52:52,382 --> 02:52:57,582
He was keeping me on the defensive, and I knew I had to turn
the tide against him somehow.

2746
02:52:57,622 --> 02:53:03,982
I dropped to one knee as Sebastian swung at me, and it left
him open as his sword flew harmlessly above my head.

2747
02:53:03,982 --> 02:53:06,422
I jabbed my blade straight into his ribcage.

2748
02:53:06,422 --> 02:53:08,942
At least, that’s where I aimed my strike.

2749
02:53:08,942 --> 02:53:15,462
Just as quickly as the opening had come, it was gone, and
Sebastian had adjusted his stance.

2750
02:53:15,462 --> 02:53:19,502
The next thing I saw was his thick boot coming straight for
my head.

2751
02:53:19,542 --> 02:53:23,782
I threw myself backward to dodge his foot and slammed hard
onto the ground.

2752
02:53:23,782 --> 02:53:29,702
The force was a little painful, but I ignored it and rolled
to the side and scrambled back onto my feet.

2753
02:53:29,702 --> 02:53:34,102
Sebastian came at me again, his blade glinting from the
sunlight.

2754
02:53:34,142 --> 02:53:37,342
It flashed brilliantly and I was momentarily blinded.

2755
02:53:37,382 --> 02:53:42,982
I brought my sword up to try and block the blow I was
expecting, but it never came.

2756
02:53:42,982 --> 02:53:46,382
Instead, pain exploded in my knee and flared up my leg.

2757
02:53:46,382 --> 02:53:51,782
I cried out in surprise and agony as my leg gave out and I
crashed to the ground.

2758
02:53:51,822 --> 02:53:54,942
I released my hold on the hilt and grabbed my knee.

2759
02:53:54,982 --> 02:54:01,662
“Do you need a healer?” Sebastian asked, lifting his visor.

2760
02:54:01,662 --> 02:54:03,342
His eyes were creased with worry.

2761
02:54:03,382 --> 02:54:04,862
I don’t know why I did it.

2762
02:54:04,862 --> 02:54:09,102
Perhaps it was the anger or the exhaustion, but I wasn’t in
my right mind.

2763
02:54:09,102 --> 02:54:11,262
I nodded, but it was a lie.

2764
02:54:11,262 --> 02:54:17,142
I was in pain, but it wasn’t as bad as I pretended, and it
was quickly fading.

2765
02:54:17,142 --> 02:54:25,422
As soon as Sebastian turned his back to me, I snatched my sword up and drove it into the back of his legs, right
behind his knees.

2766
02:54:25,422 --> 02:54:31,622
A few of the students in the stands cried out, clearly not
liking what they saw.

2767
02:54:31,702 --> 02:54:38,222
Red, hot rage flooded my vision and I went to strike
Sebastian again, but he crawled out of range on all fours.

2768
02:54:38,262 --> 02:54:40,782
To his credit, he was still holding onto his blade.

2769
02:54:40,822 --> 02:54:49,462
I went after him, but he was quicker than I anticipated and got back to his feet and twirled gracefully in a circle, his
sword held outstretched.

2770
02:54:49,462 --> 02:54:55,502
I leaped backward, but the tip of his blade grazed the
chainmail that covered my arm.

2771
02:54:55,502 --> 02:55:01,422
I was suddenly overcome with guilt for my actions, but there
was no time to apologize.

2772
02:55:01,462 --> 02:55:05,302
It was obvious that I’d angered Sebastian, for he held
nothing back.

2773
02:55:05,302 --> 02:55:09,102
He pressed his attack, his sword a flurry of strikes that I
couldn’t keep up with.

2774
02:55:09,102 --> 02:55:13,942
He knocked my sword out of my grasp and landed a solid
strike across my chest.

2775
02:55:13,982 --> 02:55:17,622
Throbbing pain erupted across my flesh despite the armor I
wore.

2776
02:55:17,622 --> 02:55:22,542
Between that and my general exhaustion, I knew I couldn’t
defeat Sebastian.

2777
02:55:22,542 --> 02:55:26,422
I collapsed to my knees and put my hands up in surrender.

2778
02:55:26,422 --> 02:55:29,982
“Do you yield?” Curate Anesko shouted from outside the
enclosure.

2779
02:55:30,182 --> 02:55:33,942
“Yes,” I tried to shout back, but I didn’t know if he heard
me.

2780
02:55:33,982 --> 02:55:39,862
Sebastian removed his helm, gave me one last long stare,
then left the battleground.

2781
02:55:39,902 --> 02:55:45,782
As I sat there in the dirt, the realization that I had
probably failed the test began to set in.

2782
02:55:45,822 --> 02:55:50,222
Not only had I let my anger get the better of me, but I had
also given up.

2783
02:55:50,222 --> 02:55:52,462
None of it could look good for me.

2784
02:55:52,462 --> 02:55:56,182
I slowly got to my feet and returned my armor and weapon to
the racks.

2785
02:55:56,222 --> 02:55:58,662
Maren joined me as I walked to the Citadel.

2786
02:55:58,662 --> 02:56:01,543
“What am I going to do now?” I asked.

2787
02:56:01,543 --> 02:56:04,703
“Nothing until you know your results,” she replied.

2788
02:56:04,703 --> 02:56:06,943
“You know I failed as well as I do.

2789
02:56:06,943 --> 02:56:09,223
There was no excuse for what I did.”

2790
02:56:09,263 --> 02:56:12,303
“True, but you did just go through a traumatic ordeal.

2791
02:56:12,303 --> 02:56:14,743
That has to be taken into account.”

2792
02:56:14,743 --> 02:56:17,063
Maren had a point, but still.

2793
02:56:17,103 --> 02:56:20,943
The sinking feeling in my stomach was making me feel like I
was going to vomit.

2794
02:56:20,943 --> 02:56:28,663
Master Pevus said anyone who failed had their memory magically erased so that they didn’t remember being at the
school or anything they learned.

2795
02:56:28,663 --> 02:56:30,823
I couldn’t allow that to happen.

2796
02:56:30,863 --> 02:56:32,703
I wouldn’t allow it to happen.

2797
02:56:32,703 --> 02:56:35,743
Maren was talking about her test, but I wasn’t listening.

2798
02:56:35,783 --> 02:56:40,103
I was plotting out how I would escape the Citadel before
Master Pevus could erase my memory.

2799
02:56:40,103 --> 02:56:42,943
There were so many obstacles, though.

2800
02:56:42,943 --> 02:56:50,103
I had to get past guards, not get caught outside of my room past curfew, and that was assuming they didn’t erase my
memory without warning.

2801
02:56:50,103 --> 02:56:52,783
If this was going to work, I would need help.

2802
02:56:52,823 --> 02:56:57,143
I looked at Maren and watched her lips move as she spoke.

2803
02:56:57,183 --> 02:57:02,063
She loved breaking rules, so I had little doubt she’d be
willing to help me.

2804
02:57:02,063 --> 02:57:04,623
She noticed my stare and paused.

2805
02:57:04,663 --> 02:57:08,063
“If there something in my teeth?” she asked.

2806
02:57:08,063 --> 02:57:10,063
“No,” I replied.

2807
02:57:10,063 --> 02:57:13,023
“Then why are you staring at me?” she asked.

2808
02:57:13,023 --> 02:57:14,383
“I need your help.”

2809
02:57:14,383 --> 02:57:16,143
“With what?”

2810
02:57:16,143 --> 02:57:19,823
I glanced around and lowered my voice. “With breaking into
the armory.”

2811
02:57:19,823 --> 02:57:22,223
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

2812
02:57:22,263 --> 02:57:26,823
The next morning, I awoke bleary-eyed and more tired than I
had probably ever been in my entire life.

2813
02:57:26,823 --> 02:57:33,583
Maren and I had been up all night devising my plan of escape
and breaking into the armory to retrieve my father’s sword.

2814
02:57:33,583 --> 02:57:41,863
Maren had left the Citadel and somehow snuck outside the city of Autumnwick to hide my father’s sword in a thicket
near the lake for me.

2815
02:57:41,863 --> 02:57:47,783
She said it had been easy and had hidden the weapon so that
only I would be able to find it.

2816
02:57:47,823 --> 02:57:49,903
I assumed she used a spell of some kind.

2817
02:57:49,903 --> 02:57:54,583
After everything had been planned, we parted ways and went
to our rooms.

2818
02:57:54,583 --> 02:57:58,183
I hadn’t slept much, though what little rest I did get had
been dreamless.

2819
02:57:58,183 --> 02:58:03,023
I was both excited and terrified to find out if I had passed
or not.

2820
02:58:03,063 --> 02:58:06,263
Everything I wanted, everything I was, hinged on my results.

2821
02:58:06,303 --> 02:58:12,183
I rolled out of bed and put my robes on, then headed down to
the dining hall for breakfast.

2822
02:58:12,223 --> 02:58:17,023
The thought that this could be the last time I knew I’d have
a meal was a little disconcerting.

2823
02:58:17,023 --> 02:58:22,223
It was funny how quickly I had grown accustomed to full
meals in the short time I’d been here.

2824
02:58:22,263 --> 02:58:25,943
Maren eventually joined me at my table and we ate in
silence.

2825
02:58:25,943 --> 02:58:33,583
I was hoping I’d be able to give her a proper goodbye if I did have to escape the Citadel, but I also knew that might
not happen.

2826
02:58:33,663 --> 02:58:36,223
She had to be aware of that fact as well.

2827
02:58:36,263 --> 02:58:39,063
I assumed that’s why she didn’t talk much.

2828
02:58:39,143 --> 02:58:44,223
After we ate, we headed back to our normal meeting place to
await Curate Anesko.

2829
02:58:44,223 --> 02:58:49,103
Normally, some of the other students straggled into the
group last minute, but today was different.

2830
02:58:49,103 --> 02:58:50,863
Everyone who remained was on time.

2831
02:58:50,863 --> 02:58:52,663
There were less than twenty of us.

2832
02:58:52,663 --> 02:58:56,063
Out of one hundred potentials, only a fifth were left.

2833
02:58:56,063 --> 02:59:00,223
It was crazy to think I had made it this far only to
potentially fail now.

2834
02:59:00,223 --> 02:59:04,503
Curate Anesko’s footsteps echoed softly off the stone walls
as he joined us.

2835
02:59:04,543 --> 02:59:09,503
His face was solemn, much different than his normal stern
appearance.

2836
02:59:09,503 --> 02:59:19,503
There were bags under his eyes, and I guessed that he had been up late with Master Pevus and the other Curates,
deciding the fates of those few students who remained.

2837
02:59:19,543 --> 02:59:23,303
“Today some of you will become full students,” he said.

2838
02:59:23,303 --> 02:59:29,103
He swept his gaze over everyone. “And some of you, sadly,
will be leaving this place forever.”

2839
02:59:29,103 --> 02:59:31,383
The word forever sounded so …cold.

2840
02:59:31,423 --> 02:59:32,183
Barren.

2841
02:59:32,223 --> 02:59:33,143
Final.

2842
02:59:33,143 --> 02:59:35,223
But of course, it was.

2843
02:59:35,383 --> 02:59:37,303
It was all those things and more.

2844
02:59:37,343 --> 02:59:39,263
“If I call your name, you will follow me.

2845
02:59:39,263 --> 02:59:42,663
If I don’t, then you will follow Curate Henrik.”

2846
02:59:42,703 --> 02:59:45,103
One of the students raised a hand.

2847
02:59:45,103 --> 02:59:48,103
“Yes?” Anesko asked.

2848
02:59:48,103 --> 02:59:52,783
“Are the groups divided into those who passed and those who
failed?”

2849
02:59:52,783 --> 02:59:59,423
“They are, but if you’re expecting me to inform you which
group you’re in, then you’ll be disappointed.

2850
02:59:59,463 --> 03:00:01,263
Any other questions?”

2851
03:00:01,263 --> 03:00:03,183
No one had any.

2852
03:00:03,183 --> 03:00:05,783
Anesko called out almost everyone’s name.

2853
03:00:05,783 --> 03:00:08,863
Two people weren’t called and they left with Curate Henrik.

2854
03:00:08,903 --> 03:00:14,503
It seemed obvious that the two who weren’t called had failed
and were being led off to have their memory erased.

2855
03:00:14,543 --> 03:00:17,943
It seemed surreal that I had passed.

2856
03:00:17,983 --> 03:00:24,183
Without another word, Anesko led us through the Citadel to
the temple where our first test had occurred.

2857
03:00:24,183 --> 03:00:30,623
Master Pevus stood beside the temple doors, welcoming every
student with a tired smile.

2858
03:00:30,623 --> 03:00:36,943
Maren and I were at the end of the line, and after Maren stepped through the threshold, Master Pevus stepped in front
of me.

2859
03:00:36,943 --> 03:00:40,703
“Eldwin,” he greeted. “Please, come with me.”

2860
03:00:40,743 --> 03:00:44,383
My trepidation returned, but mainly because I had no idea
why he pulled me aside.

2861
03:00:44,423 --> 03:00:48,303
Maren looked back at me and I shrugged, then followed Master
Pevus’s lead.

2862
03:00:48,303 --> 03:00:55,543
We walked through several of the halls and eventually reached the servant’s door that Maren had shown me when we’d
secretly went to see the dragons.

2863
03:00:55,543 --> 03:00:58,983
“I’m sure you’re curious about where we’re going,” Master
Pevus said.

2864
03:00:58,983 --> 03:01:00,423
“Yes, Master.

2865
03:01:00,423 --> 03:01:05,823
It does seem odd to me that we’re going out the servant’s
door,” I replied before realizing my error.

2866
03:01:05,823 --> 03:01:07,823
Master Pevus smiled.

2867
03:01:07,823 --> 03:01:11,783
“I see the princess has shown you this door already.”

2868
03:01:11,823 --> 03:01:14,423
“Please don’t punish her,” I said.

2869
03:01:14,423 --> 03:01:15,543
“I won’t.

2870
03:01:15,583 --> 03:01:18,303
Besides, it’s not a secret door.

2871
03:01:18,303 --> 03:01:21,823
It’s just how the servants come and go.”

2872
03:01:21,863 --> 03:01:23,743
I breathed a sigh of relief.

2873
03:01:23,743 --> 03:01:26,663
Master Pevus pushed the door open and we stepped outside.

2874
03:01:26,663 --> 03:01:29,983
It was still early in the day, and the air was cool.

2875
03:01:29,983 --> 03:01:32,783
It felt refreshing to be outdoors.

2876
03:01:32,863 --> 03:01:39,743
My curiosity started to grow as he led me around to the
entrance of the dragon stables.

2877
03:01:39,743 --> 03:01:45,823
The two guards at the entrance were playing dice and quickly
stood up when they saw Master Pevus and I approaching.

2878
03:01:45,863 --> 03:01:53,143
Master Pevus ignored them and continued walking, leading me
deeper into the stables.

2879
03:01:53,143 --> 03:01:59,183
There were many more torches lit than when I’d been here
before, and the details of the cave’s carvings were
revealed.

2880
03:01:59,183 --> 03:02:05,703
Long, jagged lines were scraped into the rocks that formed
the ceiling, floor, and walls.

2881
03:02:05,703 --> 03:02:10,943
“Dragons created this system of caves,” Master Pevus said.
“Long before the Citadel was ever built.

2882
03:02:10,943 --> 03:02:17,943
It was a breeding ground, but as humans began to domesticate
dragons, they stopped laying their eggs here.”

2883
03:02:17,943 --> 03:02:20,543
“I’ve never heard that before,” I said.

2884
03:02:20,543 --> 03:02:24,743
“This place holds a lot more secrets, though many of them
have been lost to the centuries.

2885
03:02:24,783 --> 03:02:26,103
Tell me, Eldwin.

2886
03:02:26,103 --> 03:02:28,903
Did your father tell you the color of his dragon?”

2887
03:02:28,903 --> 03:02:30,743
“He rode a blue,” I said.

2888
03:02:30,743 --> 03:02:33,583
“Indeed, he did.

2889
03:02:33,583 --> 03:02:37,863
Blues are known for their speed, as they are the fastest of
all the colors.”

2890
03:02:37,863 --> 03:02:40,863
We stopped outside one of the caves.

2891
03:02:40,863 --> 03:02:44,663
A large dragon head appeared as the massive creature moved
into the light.

2892
03:02:44,663 --> 03:02:48,543
It was the same dragon that had spit phlegm on me.

2893
03:02:48,583 --> 03:02:52,223
The dragon sniffed the air and turned its glowing eyes on
me.

2894
03:02:52,223 --> 03:02:58,863
“This is Phlandyr,” Master Pevus said. “She is a red dragon,
though it may be hard to tell in this light.”

2895
03:02:58,903 --> 03:03:01,143
“Hello Phlandyr,” I said.

2896
03:03:01,143 --> 03:03:04,863
I felt something press against my mind, but it was faint.

2897
03:03:04,863 --> 03:03:10,583
“I thought we weren’t allowed near dragons until we were
promoted to the rank of Adept?” I asked.

2898
03:03:10,583 --> 03:03:14,343
“As a general rule, you’re not,” Master Pevus confirmed.

2899
03:03:14,343 --> 03:03:18,303
He went quiet and I stared into Phlandyr’s eyes.

2900
03:03:18,303 --> 03:03:20,503
They were a yellowish hue with black pupils.

2901
03:03:20,503 --> 03:03:25,103
“Eldwin, I’m sorry to inform you that you have failed.”

2902
03:03:25,103 --> 03:03:30,343
“What?” My heart skipped a beat and fell into my stomach.

2903
03:03:30,343 --> 03:03:33,943
“You did well in the first test, despite the outside forces
that affected it.

2904
03:03:33,943 --> 03:03:38,823
The second test was interrupted, but not before we were able
to see your skill with magic.

2905
03:03:38,823 --> 03:03:44,943
Yesterday’s test, however, showed that you do not handle
frustration and failure well.

2906
03:03:44,983 --> 03:03:47,343
You allowed your anger to direct your actions.

2907
03:03:47,343 --> 03:03:51,824
A dragon rider must always have a clear mind, empty of
emotions.”

2908
03:03:51,824 --> 03:03:55,224
“Can I retake the test?” I asked.

2909
03:03:55,224 --> 03:03:57,584
“I’m afraid not.”

2910
03:03:57,584 --> 03:04:00,384
“Please, Master,” I begged.

2911
03:04:00,384 --> 03:04:03,104
My eyes welled with tears. “I can’t go home.

2912
03:04:03,104 --> 03:04:05,264
There’s nothing for me there.

2913
03:04:05,264 --> 03:04:07,584
I have to be a dragon rider.”

2914
03:04:07,584 --> 03:04:08,984
“I’m sorry, Eldwin.

2915
03:04:08,984 --> 03:04:13,064
The only way you’ll ever ride a dragon is if you find your
own.”

2916
03:04:13,104 --> 03:04:15,184
I felt a tear slip free of my eye.

2917
03:04:15,184 --> 03:04:16,744
It trailed down my cheek.

2918
03:04:16,784 --> 03:04:25,304
“I thought long and hard about this, but I have decided to let you experience what flying on the back of a dragon is
like.

2919
03:04:25,304 --> 03:04:30,744
Your father was a hero, and to honor his memory, I thought
this would be fitting.”

2920
03:04:30,784 --> 03:04:35,944
“Thank you,” I said. “But what’s the point if you are just
going to erase my memory?”

2921
03:04:35,944 --> 03:04:42,904
Master Pevus remained silent, but he stepped into the cave
and saddled Phlandyr, then led her out of the cave.

2922
03:04:42,904 --> 03:04:46,264
I walked at his side, trying to figure out a way to escape.

2923
03:04:46,264 --> 03:04:52,064
My plans with Maren had been based around being locked in a
room somewhere, not out in the open on the back of a dragon.

2924
03:04:52,064 --> 03:04:55,824
Master Pevus mounted Phlandyr and offered me his hand.

2925
03:04:55,824 --> 03:05:01,464
I accepted it and climbed into the saddle behind him, then
gripped the horn of the saddle tightly.

2926
03:05:01,504 --> 03:05:07,224
Without any verbal command, Phlandyr leaped into the air and
flapped her enormous wings.

2927
03:05:07,224 --> 03:05:11,984
We climbed higher and higher into the air, the castle below
quickly shrinking.

2928
03:05:11,984 --> 03:05:15,064
Phlandyr banked to the right and she issued a roar.

2929
03:05:15,104 --> 03:05:21,664
There were no words to describe the feeling of being on the
back of a dragon, flying through the sky.

2930
03:05:21,704 --> 03:05:25,864
I looked out at the vast landscape that stretched for miles
in every direction.

2931
03:05:25,864 --> 03:05:33,944
Trees that seemed enormous on the ground looked like small sticks, and I could see the entirety of the giant lake that
spread out behind the Citadel.

2932
03:05:33,944 --> 03:05:37,944
The air whipped around me, pulling at my robes and making my
hair ruffle wildly.

2933
03:05:37,984 --> 03:05:40,504
We flew over the lake and I looked down.

2934
03:05:40,504 --> 03:05:47,704
Phlandyr dipped lower, flying only a few feet above the
water’s surface.

2935
03:05:47,744 --> 03:05:51,104
The lake was crystal clear and I could see fish swimming
about.

2936
03:05:51,144 --> 03:05:54,784
As amazing as the experience was, I knew I was running out
of time.

2937
03:05:54,824 --> 03:05:58,664
Once we landed, the chances of escaping from the Citadel
would be slim.

2938
03:05:58,664 --> 03:06:02,904
The only way you’ll ever ride a dragon is if you find your
own.

2939
03:06:02,904 --> 03:06:06,344
Those words burned in my mind and I had an idea.

2940
03:06:06,344 --> 03:06:10,584
It was crazy, foolish even, but I had no other choice.

2941
03:06:10,584 --> 03:06:16,104
I let go of the saddle horn and swung my right leg over to
the same side as my left.

2942
03:06:16,144 --> 03:06:20,784
Master Pevus tried to turn around to see what I was doing,
but he was having trouble.

2943
03:06:20,824 --> 03:06:25,664
I did a silent countdown, then pushed myself off the side of
the dragon just as she bounded upward.

2944
03:06:25,664 --> 03:06:31,744
I flipped end over end and saw Master Pevus’s horrified
expression before he was too far away to see anymore.

2945
03:06:31,784 --> 03:06:36,184
I tried to right myself, but I slammed into the water with
jarring force.

2946
03:06:36,184 --> 03:06:42,464
My body screamed in agony and then I was underwater,
struggling with which direction was up.

2947
03:06:42,504 --> 03:06:50,224
I pumped my arms furiously and kicked with my legs until I broke the surface of the water, then I gasped in deep
breaths.

2948
03:06:50,264 --> 03:06:51,584
Time was my enemy.

2949
03:06:51,704 --> 03:06:55,744
I turned and swam for the shore as fast as I could.

2950
03:06:55,744 --> 03:07:02,704
I heard Phlandyr’s roars and they drove me to keep swimming
even though my muscles wanted to give in.

2951
03:07:02,784 --> 03:07:07,344
I reached the shore and sprinted to the thicket of trees
that Maren had told me about.

2952
03:07:07,344 --> 03:07:10,304
The air rippled, and then I saw my father’s sword.

2953
03:07:10,304 --> 03:07:15,344
The sheath was attached to a belt and had been hung on a low
hanging branch.

2954
03:07:15,384 --> 03:07:20,064
I grabbed it and strapped the belt on, then ran in the
opposite direction of the Citadel.

2955
03:07:20,064 --> 03:07:24,424
I had no idea where I was going, but I refused to let Master
Pevus erase my memories.

2956
03:07:24,464 --> 03:07:29,024
He said that the only way I would ride a dragon was to find
my own.

2957
03:07:29,024 --> 03:07:30,144
So be it.

2958
03:07:30,184 --> 03:07:31,944
I ran as fast as I could.

2959
03:07:31,944 --> 03:07:35,504
Away from the Citadel and toward an uncertain future.

2960
03:07:35,504 --> 03:07:37,944
I was going to find a dragon of my own.

2961
03:07:37,984 --> 03:07:44,384
-THE END-
