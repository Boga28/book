CHAPTER ONE
A Mountain Accident

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:18,160
Aron pulled his arm, carefully at first, and 
then more strongly, but it did not come free.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,640
It was a beautiful spring day and 27-year-old 
Aron Ralston was walking in the mountains  

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,480
after a hard week at work. The air was 
fresh, and the sun was high in the sky.  

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,960
Aron stopped walking to listen 
to the silence of the mountains.  

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,840
"This is wonderful," he thought. "No work 
or noise. Only beautiful country around me.

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,680
As he continued on his way, he heard a 
low noise. He looked up quickly at the  

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,320
mountainside above him-but he was too late. 
Large pieces of rock were falling toward him  

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,560
and he could not escape quickly 
enough. The earth was moving,  

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,080
and the noise was terrible. In seconds, Aron's arm 
was caught under a rock that weighed 500 kilos.

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,720
The pain was terrible, but Aron stayed calm. 
He knew a lot about the mountains. He knew how  

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,160
to live in the wildest and most dangerous open 
spaces. He pulled his arm, carefully at first,  

13
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:34,080
and then more strongly, but it did not come free. 
Next, he pushed the rock as hard as possible.  

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:43,920
Again-nothing. It was getting dark. Aron ate a 
small amount of food and drank some of his water.  

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,080
He wanted to keep strong, get some 
rest, and try again in the morning.

16
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,840
After a difficult night's sleep, Aron 
thought carefully about his problem.  

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,960
Today was Sunday, a popular day for walking. 
He decided to wait for help to arrive.  

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,880
He looked hopefully up and 
down the narrow mountain path,  

19
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,640
but the mountains were empty and silent. The 
morning passed and the sun moved to the west.  

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,160
By late afternoon it was too late for 
walkers. Aron needed a different plan.

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,160
Using his climbing equipment, he tried to move the 
rock. He tried a number of different ways, but it  

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,120
was too heavy. Next, he took his pocket knife and 
tried to break away small pieces of the rock near  

23
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,800
his arm. "This will destroy my good knife," he 
thought, "but my life is more important!" But  

24
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,840
the knife failed to cut even the smallest piece 
of rock. Aron knew that he was really caught.  

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,280
He made himself as comfortable as 
possible for another lonely night.

26
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,480
Aron had enough water and food with him 
for a day's walk. But it was day three  

27
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,080
now and the food was almost finished. He 
only had enough for one more small meal.  

28
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:18,160
In his mind, a difficult and dangerous plan 
was growing, but he did not want to try yet.

29
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,680
It was Tuesday morning. After three difficult 
nights in the mountains, Aron was tired and  

30
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:33,040
hungry. He drank the last of his water and thought 
carefully. Now he knew that he had to cut off  

31
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,440
his arm. He took his knife from his pocket 
and bravely put the metal against his skin.  

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:49,440
He pressed down hard and began to cut. But after 
his work on the rock, the knife was not sharp.  

33
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,640
"I couldn't even cut the hair off my arm," 
he explained to newspaper reporters later.

34
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:03,600
Aron used the rock to make his knife sharp again. 
Then he cut through his skin as far as the bone.

35
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,520
"Then I found that I couldn't cut the bone," he 
calmly told the reporters. For two more days Aron  

36
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,760
tried different ways to cut his arm off. Without 
food or drink, his body was getting weaker.  

37
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,320
But his mind was clear and strong. "I 
did what I had to do," he explained.

38
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:34,240
Aron turned his arm the opposite way to his 
body. The first arm bone broke easily. Then he  

39
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,840
broke the second. He tied a piece of cloth tightly 
around the top of his right arm to stop the blood.

40
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,640
Then, slowly, he cut through the rest of his arm.

41
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,360
At last Aron was free! He looked down at his 
lifeless arm under the rock. It seemed like a  

42
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,080
strange dream. His clothes were covered in blood 
and the pain in his right shoulder was terrible.  

43
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,840
Aron felt very small and unimportant under 
the wide sky and tall, dark mountains.

44
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Aron was still in great danger.

45
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,320
He was a long way from home and he was losing 
blood fast. Darkness was only a few hours away.  

46
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,600
He had to get to a road as quickly as possible. 
He looked below him and thought carefully.  

47
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,920
It was an eighteen-meter drop to the valley floor, 
but it was the fastest way back. He had to try.

48
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,040
Aron started to lower himself 
down the steep mountainside.  

49
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,360
It was hard, slow work with only one arm, but 
finally his feet touched the valley floor.  

50
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,240
The nearest road was still 
sixteen kilometers away.

51
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,600
There was no time to rest. Aron 
felt weak. It was difficult to  

52
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:06,080
think clearly. "I am going to do it," he 
told himself. "Just one step at a time..."

53
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,320
Aron started walking. He had to reach help 
quickly. One more night in the wild mountains was  

54
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:19,840
too dangerous. Each painful step took him closer 
to help. But the walk was very long and difficult.

55
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,960
At last, after six hours, Aron saw two 
other walkers. He wanted to run and shout,  

56
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,840
but his body was too weak. 
When they finally saw him,  

57
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:40,800
the worried walkers gave Aron chocolate cookies 
and water. Then they moved him to open ground.  

58
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,640
Here, the flying mountain police found the 
group, and they took Aron immediately to the  

59
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,840
nearest hospital. For the first time, Aron 
knew that he was safe. He was truly alive!

60
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,040
Hours later, Aron lay quietly in his hospital bed 
and looked up at the shiny white walls around him.  

61
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,920
He was in a different world now - a 
small, safe world of men and machines.  

62
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,720
But part of him belongs forever to the 
wilder world of rock and mountain and sky.  

63
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:29,840
Aron says that he cannot wait to 
get out into the wild again.
 
 
 
 

64
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
-  

65
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,342
THE END -
