PART ONE
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
A Warning

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,410
A letter arrived for Sherlock Holmes. We were
sitting in our rooms at 221b Baker Street.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,820
'It's Porlock's writing,' he said. 'It must
be very important.'

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,640
'Who is Porlock?' I asked.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,790
'Porlock is just a name: it's not his real
one. He is a man who is in touch with the

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,730
great criminal mastermind, Professor Moriarty.
You've heard me talk about him?'

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,050
'Yes, he's famous among criminals but unknown
to the public.'

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:44,920
That's right. He's the "brain" that controls
all crime; we'll catch him one day, Watson.'

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,450
'Anyway, what about this letter and Porlock?'

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,969
'He works for Professor Moriarty. He has sent
me information twice before which has helped

12
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,120
to prevent crimes.'

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,039
Holmes opened the letter and read it. The
message said that a man called Douglas at

14
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,830
Birlstone Manor House was in great danger.

15
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,600
There was a knock at the door and Inspector
MacDonald of Scotland Yard walked in. Holmes

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,250
looked pleased to see him.

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,890
'You're out early,' he said.

18
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,970
But the inspector had stopped suddenly. He
was staring at the message.

19
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:30,380
'Douglas! Birlstone? What's this, Mr Holmes?
Magic? How did you get those names?'

20
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,520
'Why?' asked Holmes. 'What's wrong with those
names?'

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,720
'Mr Douglas of Birlstone Manor House was murdered
this morning.'

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,780
Sherlock Holmes explained to the inspector
how he had just received the letter.

23
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:55,520
'I was on my way to Birlstone,' said the inspector.
'I came to ask if you and Doctor Watson wanted

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,040
to come with me but, from what you say about
this Porlock, we'll find out more in London.'

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,439
'I don't think so,' said Holmes.

26
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,500
'Well, if there's a man in London who knew
about the crime before it happened, then we

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,920
need to find him!'

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,430
'And how do you suggest we find Porlock?'
asked Holmes. 'I don't know him, I've never

29
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:26,820
seen him, I don't know where he is and, what's
more, I know that Professor Moriarty is involved.

30
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:33,310
We'll find nothing in London, MacDonald, we
must go to Birlstone to solve this crime.'

31
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,390
The inspector stood up.

32
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,560
'Let's go. Can you be ready in five minutes?'

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,330
On our way down to Birlstone, the inspector
told us what he knew about the case, which

34
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,750
was not very much. John Douglas of Birlstone
Manor House was shot in the head with a shotgun.

35
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,750
It happened at around midnight the night before.
The police had not yet arrested anyone.

36
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,540
Birlstone was a small village in Sussex. About
half a mile from the village was the Manor

37
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:10,800
House of Birlstone. It was a very old house,
built in the seventeenth century. A moat surrounded

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,970
the house. The only way to get into the house
was over the drawbridge. This drawbridge was

39
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:23,290
raised every night and lowered every morning
by the owners of the Manor House. This meant

40
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:29,410
that the house was like an island during the
night. This was a very important fact in the

41
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,209
mystery at Birlstone.

42
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:38,170
The owners were Mr John Douglas and his wife.
Douglas was a handsome American man about

43
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:44,580
fifty years old. He was popular in the village
because he was friendly and also rich. He

44
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,850
had earned his money in California, then came
to live in England, where he met his wife.

45
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:57,319
Mrs Douglas was a beautiful woman, about twenty
years younger than her husband. They were

46
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,939
very happy together, although it seemed that
Mrs Douglas did not know everything about

47
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:05,390
her husband's past.

48
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,910
There was one other person who often stayed
with the couple and was also at the Manor

49
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:16,709
House at the time of the murder. His name
was Cecil Barker. He was a good friend of

50
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:23,710
John Douglas and was the only person from
Douglas's unknown past life. Although Barker

51
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:29,860
was English, he had met John Douglas in America.
Barker was friendly with both Douglas and

52
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:37,660
his wife. Sometimes his friendship with Mrs
Douglas seemed to irritate John Douglas. The

53
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,889
other people who were in the house at the
time of the murder were Ames the butler and

54
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,000
Mrs Allen the housekeeper.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,240
It was at eleven forty-five at night on 6th
January that Cecil Barker told Sergeant Wilson

56
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,360
at the local police station that someone had
murdered Mr John Douglas.

57
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,180
When he reached the house, Sergeant Wilson
found the drawbridge down and everyone was

58
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:10,770
confused and alarmed. Only Cecil Barker seemed
calm and in control.

59
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:16,630
The dead man was in the center of the room,
lying on his back. The shotgun was lying on

60
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:24,030
his chest; the end of the gun was sawn off.
The murderer had fired the gun very close

61
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:31,070
to his victim and the shot had almost blown
his head to pieces. The doctor was called

62
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,290
but he knew there was nothing he could do.

63
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,570
The country policeman was not used to such
serious crime.

64
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,660
'We won't touch anything until the officers
from London arrive,' he said.

65
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:49,570
'I haven't touched anything,' said Cecil Barker.
'This is exactly as I found it. It was just

66
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:54,770
after half past eleven and I was sitting in
my bedroom when I heard the shot. It wasn't

67
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,100
very loud. I rushed down.'

68
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,550
'Was the door open?'

69
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:04,500
'Yes, it was open. Douglas was lying just
as you see him now. There was a candle burning

70
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,720
on the table. I lit the lamp.'

71
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,479
'Did you see anyone?'

72
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,680
'No, I heard Mrs Douglas coming down the stairs
behind me and I rushed out to stop her from

73
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
seeing this terrible sight.'

74
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,270
'But wasn't the drawbridge raised as usual?'

75
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,450
'Yes, it was up until I lowered it,' said
Barker.

76
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,030
'Then how could the murderer have got away?'

77
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:35,060
'Look.' Barker pulled back the curtain. One
of the windows was wide open. 'Look at this.'

78
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,780
He pointed to a blood stain that was shaped
like a footprint. 'Someone has climbed out

79
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,780
here.'

80
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,039
'You think that someone waded across the moat?'

81
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,039
'Exactly.'

82
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,860
'Well, you were in the room half a minute
after the murder, so this means that he was

83
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,310
in the water then.'

84
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,160
'I know. I didn't know the window was open
because it was hidden by the curtain.'

85
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,810
The policeman was thinking.

86
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,210
'You're saying that the man escaped by wading
across the moat. But how did he get into the

87
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,259
house if the drawbridge was up?

88
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:15,860
'That's a good question,' agreed Barker.

89
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,860
CHAPTER TWO
Murder at Birlstone

90
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,710
'What time was the bridge raised?' asked the
policeman.

91
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:32,520
'It was six o'clock,' said Ames the butler.
'Mrs Douglas had visitors so I raised it after

92
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,580
they left.'

93
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,759
'So if anyone came in from outside - if they
did - then they came into the house before

94
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,110
six and hid there until Mr Douglas came into
the room at about eleven o'clock.'

95
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:51,470
'That's right. Mr Douglas always checked all
the lights in the house before he went to

96
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:58,470
bed. He came in here, where the man was waiting
to shoot him. Then the murderer got away through

97
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:04,380
the window and left the gun behind. That's
what I think.'

98
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,289
The policeman picked up a card which was lying
on the floor beside the dead man. The initials

99
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:15,910
V.V. and the number 341 were written on the
card.

100
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,520
'What's this?' asked the policeman.

101
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,880
Barker looked at it.

102
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,520
'I didn't notice it before. The murderer probably
left it behind.'

103
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,870
'V.V. 341. What does it mean? Somebody's initials,
maybe.'

104
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:39,630
The policeman walked slowly around the room.
He pulled back a window curtain. 'Look at

105
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:46,170
this!' he said excitedly. 'Someone was hiding
here, look at these muddy footprints.'

106
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,260
'What's this mark on his arm?' asked the doctor.

107
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:58,290
On the dead man's right arm was a strange
brown design: a triangle inside a circle.

108
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:04,070
'It's not a tattoo,' said the doctor. 'I've
never seen anything like it. This mark has

109
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,300
been burnt onto the man. What does it mean?'

110
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,920
'I don't know what it means but Douglas has
had that mark for at least ten years,' said

111
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,450
Cecil Barker.

112
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:19,920
'Yes,' agreed the butler. 'I've often noticed
it and wondered what it is.'

113
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,200
'Then it has nothing to do with the crime
anyway,' said the policeman.

114
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,030
The butler suddenly gave a shout of surprise.

115
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,170
'What is it now?' said the policeman.

116
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,149
'They've taken his wedding ring! He always
wore his wedding ring below this other one

117
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:39,330
with the snake on it,' said the butler.

118
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,620
'You mean that the murderer first took off
this snake ring, then the wedding ring and

119
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,870
afterwards put the snake ring back on again?'

120
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,910
'It looks that way,' said the butler.

121
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:56,570
The policeman shook his head. 'The sooner
the London police get here the better,' he

122
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,080
said.

123
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,730
The Chief Detective for Sussex was Mr Mason.
He was waiting for us at the railway station

124
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,130
in Birlstone the next day.

125
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:14,510
'A very interesting case, MacDonald,' he said.
He took us to our hotel. We sat down and Mason

126
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:20,140
told us the details. Sherlock Holmes listened
carefully.

127
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,600
'So what have you discovered so far?' he said
when Mason had finished.

128
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,579
'I examined the shotgun,' said Mason. 'The
gun wasn't very long and could easily be hidden

129
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:40,260
under a coat. It was made in America. The
butler says he has never seen it in the house

130
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:48,690
before. It suggests that the stranger who
entered the house and killed Douglas is American.'

131
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,350
MacDonald shook his head.

132
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,200
'I've heard nothing that proves that a stranger
was even in the house.'

133
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,690
'What about the open window, the blood by
the window, the muddy footprints?'

134
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:08,180
'They are all things which can be set up.
The business with the ring and the card suggests

135
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:14,490
premeditated murder for a private reason.
But why would the murderer choose such a noisy

136
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:20,010
weapon if he wanted to get away unnoticed?
What do you think, Holmes?'

137
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:26,071
'It does seem strange,' agreed Holmes. 'Can
we go to the house now? There may be some

138
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:29,440
clues that will help us,' he added.

139
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,750
We walked through the village towards Birlstone
Manor. Sergeant Wilson was still there.

140
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,690
'Anything new?' Mason asked the policeman.

141
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,010
'No, sir.'

142
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:48,779
'Then go home. You're tired. The butler can
wait outside. Tell Cecil Barker and Mrs Douglas

143
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:55,579
we want to talk to them in a short while.
Now, I'll tell you what I think so far. I

144
00:11:55,579 --> 00:12:02,660
think it's murder. The question is, was it
done by someone from outside or inside the

145
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,380
house? It doesn't seem likely that it was
someone inside the house: they did it at a

146
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:15,160
time when the house was quiet but no one was
asleep, and used the noisiest weapon possible,

147
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,220
which hasn't been seen inside the house before.
So we come back to the theory that it was

148
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,890
done by someone from the outside.'

149
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,399
Holmes nodded in agreement.

150
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,899
'So, the man gets into the house sometime
between four thirty and six. He hid behind

151
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:39,050
the curtain until about eleven, when Douglas
entered the room. If the two men spoke, then

152
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:44,649
it was not for long. Mrs Douglas said her
husband had left her only a few minutes before

153
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:45,950
she heard the shot.'

154
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:52,030
'The candle shows that. It's a new candle
but it has only burnt down a little,' said

155
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,389
Holmes.

156
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:59,920
'Exactly. That means he put it on the table
before he was attacked. This shows he wasn't

157
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,810
attacked as soon as he entered the room. When
Barker arrived, the candle was lit and the

158
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,850
lamp was out.'

159
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,510
'That all seems clear,' said Holmes.

160
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:16,230
'So Douglas enters the room. He puts down
the candle. A man appears from behind the

161
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:23,220
curtain with a gun. He asks for the wedding
ring - we don't know why but it seems so.

162
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:30,760
Mr Douglas gives it to him. Then the man shoots
Douglas. He drops the gun and this card "V.V.

163
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,070
341", whatever that means, and then escapes
through the window and across the moat, just

164
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:41,950
as Cecil Barker discovers the crime. How does
that sound, Mr Holmes?'

165
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,980
'Interesting, but not very believable,' said
Holmes.

166
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,610
'What's your theory then, Holmes?'

167
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,889
'I'd like a few more facts before I come up
with a theory,' said Holmes. 'Ames, can you

168
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:57,260
come in here for a moment please?'

169
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,990
The butler came in. 'Now, you've seen this
mark on Mr Douglas's arm before?'

170
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,300
'Often, sir,' agreed Ames.

171
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,220
'There is also a small piece of plaster on
Mr Douglas's chin. Did you see that when he

172
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,260
was alive?' asked Holmes.

173
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:19,060
'Yes sir, he cut himself shaving yesterday
morning,' said Ames.

174
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,529
'Did he often cut himself shaving?' asked
Holmes.

175
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,790
'Not for a very long time, sir.'

176
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:32,449
'Interesting!' said Holmes. 'This might mean
he was nervous and knew that he was in danger.

177
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:36,089
Did you notice anything unusual in his behavior
yesterday, Ames?'

178
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:40,450
'He did seem a bit nervous, sir,' said the
butler.

179
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:50,010
'So, perhaps the attack wasn't unexpected
then. Now, what about the card - V.V. 341.

180
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,880
What do you think that means, MacDonald?'

181
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,290
'It seems like a secret society of some sort.
I thought the same about the mark on the arm.'

182
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:06,440
'Someone from a secret society gets into the
house, kills Mr Douglas and leaves this card.

183
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,560
The newspapers will report it, so other members
of the society will know that vengeance has

184
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:19,690
been done. But why this gun? Why the missing
ring? Why has no one been arrested yet?'

185
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,350
Holmes walked over to the window and examined
the blood stain.

186
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,850
'It's a footprint but it looks very wide to
me, wider than the other footprints over in

187
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:36,389
the corner. What's this under the table?'
asked Holmes, bending to pick up the object.

188
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:40,610
'Mr Douglas's dumbbells,' said Ames.

189
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:47,260
'Dumbbell,' corrected Holmes. 'There's only
one of them. Where's the other?'

190
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:55,110
'I don't know, Mr Holmes. Perhaps there was
only one. I haven't noticed them for months.'

191
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:02,519
Holmes looked serious. 'One dumbbell...' He
was interrupted by a knock on the door. Cecil

192
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,940
Barker came in.

193
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:11,060
'Sorry to interrupt,' he said, 'but they've
found his bicycle. The man left it behind.

194
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,410
Come and look.'

195
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,850
CHAPTER THREE
The People of the Drama

196
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,470
The bicycle was hidden behind some bushes.

197
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:29,960
'Well, it's something,' said Mason. 'But why
has the man left it behind? How did he get

198
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,079
away without it? We are no closer to solving
this mystery, Holmes.'

199
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,509
'Aren't we?' answered Holmes thoughtfully.

200
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,320
We moved to the dining room to hear evidence
from the people who were in the house at the

201
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,610
time of the murder. Ames the butler told us
what he had heard and seen. He had not heard

202
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:53,130
the shot because he was at the back of the
house in the kitchen. He heard the ringing

203
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,149
of the bell which called for the servants
of the house. He and the housekeeper went

204
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:03,140
to the front of the house together. When they
got to the bottom of the stairs, Mrs Douglas

205
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:09,720
was coming down. She was not hurrying and
she did not seem agitated. Then Mr Barker

206
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,240
came rushing out of the study telling Mrs
Douglas to go back.

207
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,990
'Go back to your room! John is dead! There
is nothing you can do! Please go back to your

208
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,069
room!'

209
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:28,000
Mrs Douglas did as he said. She did not scream.
The housekeeper went with her. Barker and

210
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,120
the butler went into the study, where they
found everything just as the police had seen

211
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,410
it. The candle was not lit at that time but
the lamp was. They looked out of the window

212
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:45,380
but it was very dark and they had seen and
heard nothing. The housekeeper said that Mrs

213
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,570
Douglas had been scared but had not tried
to go downstairs. The housekeeper stayed with

214
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,520
her that night.

215
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,670
Cecil Barker was next. He told the police
his theory about the murder. There were some

216
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:04,370
events in Douglas's life that he never spoke
about. Barker had met Douglas, who was a widower

217
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:10,960
at the time, in California. They ran a successful
mining company together. Douglas had suddenly

218
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,289
sold his share and gone to England. Afterwards,
Barker also sold his share and went to England

219
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:23,861
where he and John Douglas met again. Barker
thought that Douglas was in some danger. He

220
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:28,090
thought that a secret society was after John
and wanted to kill him.

221
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,559
'How long were you together in California?'
asked MacDonald.

222
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,120
'Five years altogether,' said Barker.

223
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,820
'And he was a widower, you said? Do you know
where his first wife was from?' he asked.

224
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,679
'No, but I saw a picture of her. She was a
very beautiful woman. She died the year before

225
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,730
I met him.'

226
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,620
'Was there anything strange about him in California?'

227
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,100
Only that he didn't like to be near other
men. That's why I thought someone was after

228
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,480
him. I think he had a warning of some sort,
that's why he left so suddenly for Europe.

229
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,670
Only a few days after he left, some men were
asking about him,' said Barker.

230
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:14,590
That was six years ago. Before that you were
together for five years in California. Eleven

231
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:21,559
years is a long time to keep a fight going.
It was definitely something serious. Did you

232
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,750
know Mrs Douglas before the marriage?'

233
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,730
'No, I didn't.'

234
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,640
'But you've seen a lot of her since?'

235
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,751
'What are you saying, detective? I've seen
a lot of him since. And so of course I have

236
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:35,210
become friends with Mrs Douglas.'

237
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,300
'Was Mr Douglas happy about your friendship
with his wife?'

238
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,130
'You have no right to ask such questions!'
said Barker angrily.

239
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,000
The inspector waited.

240
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,420
'Well, I suppose you have to do your job.
Please don't ask Mrs Douglas about this. She

241
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,480
is worried enough. Douglas had just one fault
and that was his jealousy. But no man had

242
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,950
a more loving and faithful wife or a more
loyal friend.'

243
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:08,940
'But the fact that the wedding ring has gone
suggests that the marriage and the murder

244
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,120
are connected, don't you think?'

245
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,070
'I don't know what it suggests,' said Barker,
'but I think you're on the wrong track.'

246
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:24,700
The next witness was Mrs Douglas. She was
a tall, beautiful woman of thirty. Her face

247
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:31,870
was very white but she seemed calm. 'Have
you found anything out yet?' she asked.

248
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:39,440
'We are doing all we can, Mrs Douglas. Perhaps
you may be able to help us. Mr Barker said

249
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,020
that you were never actually in the room where
the tragedy took place.'

250
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,120
'That's right. He told me to go back to my
room.'

251
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,190
'You have only known your husband in England,
is that right?'

252
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,160
'Yes, we've been married for five years.'

253
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,380
'Have you heard him speak of something that
happened in America which may be dangerous

254
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,840
for him?'

255
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,780
Mrs Douglas thought carefully before answering.

256
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:14,490
'Yes,' she said finally. 'I have always felt
that there was some sort of danger from his

257
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,960
past, but he didn't talk to me about it.'

258
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,610
'How did you know then?' asked the detective.

259
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:27,570
'In many ways,' she replied. 'Because of the
way he didn't talk about some parts of his

260
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:34,770
life in America. Because of some of the things
he said. The way he looked at strangers. I

261
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:41,320
always felt sure that he had some powerful
enemies and that he was always ready to defend

262
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
himself.'

263
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,760
'What sort of things did he say?' asked Sherlock
Holmes.

264
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:53,580
'"The Valley of Fear",' replied Mrs Douglas.
'He said, ''I have been in the Valley of Fear

265
00:21:53,580 --> 00:22:01,280
and I'm not out of it yet." I asked him, "Can
we ever get out of the Valley of Fear?" and

266
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,650
he said very seriously, "Sometimes I don't
think we ever will".'

267
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,320
'But didn't you ask him what he meant by "the
Valley of Fear"?'

268
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,330
'Of course, but he never told me. All I know
is that it was a real valley that he lived

269
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:22,150
in once where something terrible happened.
I can't tell you anymore.'

270
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,760
'Did he ever mention any names?'

271
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:33,510
'Yes, once, when he had a fever, he said the
name "Master McGinty". There was definitely

272
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,860
a connection between the Valley of Fear and
Master McGinty.'

273
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,220
'You've heard that his wedding ring was taken;
why do you think that is?'

274
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:48,030
'I really don't know,' she replied. 'It's
an extraordinary thing.'

275
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:54,120
'Well, we won't keep you any longer. Thank
you for your time, Mrs Douglas. If there is

276
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,919
anything else, we can ask you later.'

277
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,090
Mrs Douglas left the room.

278
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:09,570
'She's a very beautiful woman,' said MacDonald
thoughtfully. 'This man Barker has been here

279
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:16,870
a lot. There may be something between them.
He admits that the dead man was jealous. Then

280
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:26,230
there's that wedding ring. What do you think,
Mr Holmes?'

281
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,740
CHAPTER FOUR
The Missing Dumbbell

282
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,659
Holmes called the butler in.

283
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:39,200
'Can you remember, Ames, what Mr Barker was
wearing on his feet when you joined him in

284
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
the study?'

285
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,480
'Yes, Mr Holmes. He had a pair of bedroom
slippers on. I brought him his boots when

286
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,770
he went for the police.'

287
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,710
'Where are the slippers now?'

288
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,580
'They are still under a chair in the hall.'

289
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:59,410
'Good. It's important to know which footprints
belong to Mr Barker and which come from outside.'

290
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:06,090
'Yes, sir. I noticed that the slippers were
marked with blood, sir. So were mine.'

291
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,850
'Thank you, Ames.'

292
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:13,520
We returned to the study. Holmes brought the
slippers with him from the hall. The slippers

293
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,960
were dark with blood.

294
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:23,410
'Strange!' said Holmes. He was examining the
slippers by the light of the window. 'Very

295
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,279
strange indeed!'

296
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:32,630
He placed the slipper on the blood stain under
the window. It matched exactly. Holmes looked

297
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,290
at the others.

298
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:40,260
MacDonald looked excited. 'Barker made the
mark under the window himself! What's going

299
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,370
on Holmes? What does it mean?'

300
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:48,360
'That's the question,' said Holmes. 'What
does it mean?'

301
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,500
The three detectives had many small details
to investigate. I decided to return to the

302
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:00,870
village on my own. I walked through the garden
of the house. At the far end was a hedge of

303
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:08,120
yew trees. Behind these was a stone seat,
hidden from view. As I approached, I heard

304
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:15,020
some voices coming from the area of the stone
seat. I came around the trees and saw Mrs

305
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:22,140
Douglas and Mr Barker. They did not see me
straight away. I was shocked by Mrs Douglas's

306
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:28,669
appearance. Before, she had been very quiet.
Now her eyes were shining and she was laughing

307
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:35,650
at something Barker had just said. Barker
was also smiling. Just too late they both

308
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:42,730
saw me and assumed more serious expressions.
They spoke briefly to each other, then Barker

309
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,870
got up and walked towards me.

310
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:50,669
'Excuse me sir, but are you Doctor Watson?
Mrs Douglas wants to ask you something.'

311
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:56,600
I did not really want to talk to her. I saw
clearly in my mind the body of the dead man

312
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:03,840
lying on the floor. Here, only a few hours
after the tragedy, was his wife laughing with

313
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,700
another man. But I went over to them.

314
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:15,039
'You're a good friend of Mr Holmes. Tell me,'
she asked, 'if I told him something, does

315
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:21,040
he have to tell the detectives? Is he working
on his own or is he with them?'

316
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:28,380
'Mr Holmes is independent,' I replied, 'but
he won't hide anything from the detectives.

317
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,580
You must ask Holmes himself.'

318
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,919
I left them and continued walking.

319
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,220
When I told Holmes what had happened, he said
that he did not want to hear anything from

320
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,260
them.

321
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,980
'It can get complicated if we have to make
an arrest for murder,' he said.

322
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,980
'Why, have you solved it, Holmes?'

323
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,401
'Oh, not yet, but when we find the missing
dumbbell-'

324
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,380
'The dumbbell?'

325
00:26:53,380 --> 00:27:01,360
'Watson, you must realize how important that
missing dumbbell is! What use is one dumbbell?'

326
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,779
He continued talking.

327
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:10,730
'A lie, Watson - that's what we have here.
A great big lie. Barker's story is a lie and

328
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:17,530
Mrs Douglas is helping him. They are both
lying. So why are they lying and what is the

329
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,940
truth that they are trying to hide?'

330
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,270
'How can you be so sure they're lying?' I
asked.

331
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:30,039
'Because it simply can't be true! According
to their story, the murderer had less than

332
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:35,290
a minute after the murder to take the wedding
ring, which was under another ring, then to

333
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:41,760
replace the other ring and put the card by
the victim. This is impossible. I don't think

334
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,630
that the ring was taken before the victim
was killed. The candle was lit for only a

335
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:52,580
short time. I think the murderer was alone
with the dead man for some time with the lamp

336
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:59,250
lit. But the gunshot was the cause of death:
therefore the gun was fired much earlier than

337
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:05,770
we have been told. So the two people who heard
the gunshot, Mr Barker and Mrs Douglas, are

338
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:12,340
obviously both lying for some reason. And
now we can also show that Barker put the footprint

339
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,710
under the window. It doesn't look good for
Barker.'

340
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,950
'So what time did the murder actually occur?
The housekeeper said she heard a noise at

341
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:27,950
about quarter to eleven, about half an hour
before Barker called them. I think that this

342
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:34,549
was the gunshot and the real time of the murder.
If I'm correct, what were Mr Barker and Mrs

343
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:39,840
Douglas doing, if they aren't the actual murderers,
from a quarter to eleven when they heard the

344
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,510
shot, to a quarter past eleven when they rang
the bell for the servants?'

345
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:50,230
'I'm sure there is something going on between
those two,' I agreed. 'Do you think that they

346
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,241
are guilty of the murder?' I asked.

347
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:58,429
'I think that Mr Barker and Mrs Douglas know
the truth about this murder. I'm not sure

348
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:03,020
that they are the murderers themselves. I
think that an evening alone in the study will

349
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,380
help a lot. Can I borrow your umbrella please,
Watson?'

350
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,250
I was confused, but I gave him my umbrella
anyway.

351
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,750
Later that evening, Inspector MacDonald and
Mr Mason returned. They had found out more

352
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,789
about the owner of the bicycle: he was an
American who was staying at a hotel in the

353
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:28,720
nearby town of Tunbridge Wells. According
to the people at the hotel he was a tall,

354
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,529
handsome man of about fifty. He was dressed
in a grey suit and a short yellow coat and

355
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:35,529
cap.

356
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:40,290
'He sounds very similar to Mr Douglas,' remarked
Holmes.

357
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,610
Holmes told the detectives about his theories
and what he intended to do that evening. The

358
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,760
detectives asked if they could help.

359
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:58,470
'No, no,' said Holmes. 'All I need is darkness
and Watson's umbrella.'

360
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:04,200
CHAPTER FIVE
The Mystery is Solved

361
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,730
The next morning, the detectives were trying
to find the owner of the bicycle.

362
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,309
'Any luck?' asked Holmes.

363
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:17,700
'Well, so far, we have reports of a man in
a yellow coat in Leicester, Nottingham, Southampton

364
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,230
and Liverpool. The country seems to be full
of people in yellow coats,' replied MacDonald.

365
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,190
'What about you? Did you find out anything
last night?'

366
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:33,840
'I can't really tell you at the moment. However,
I have found out that Charles I was once hidden

367
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,220
in this house for several days during the
Civil War,' said Holmes.

368
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,130
'I don't see what that has to do with this
case,' said Mason.

369
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:50,090
'Well, I want to give you both some advice.
I can't tell you everything that I know yet,

370
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:56,450
but my advice to you is to abandon the case
for today. Meet me here this evening and things

371
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,360
will become clear.'

372
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,280
The detectives were not very happy about this
but eventually agreed.

373
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:11,489
'One more thing, I want you to write a letter
to Mr Barker. Write this down. "Dear Sir,

374
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:15,929
we have decided to drain the moat in the hope
that we may find some-"'

375
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:20,730
MacDonald interrupted. 'It's impossible. We've
already made inquiries.'

376
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:27,510
'"- in the hope that we may find something
which will help in the case. I have made arrangements

377
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:34,350
and the workmen will begin tomorrow morning."
Now sign that and deliver it this afternoon.

378
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,010
Then meet me here when it gets dark.'

379
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:43,309
The detectives were obviously annoyed but
agreed to do as Holmes asked.

380
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:48,799
Later that evening, Holmes took us outside
into the grounds of the Manor House. We stopped

381
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,510
opposite the windows of the study. 'Now what?'
asked MacDonald.

382
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:59,470
'We must wait,' said Holmes. 'We need to be
patient.'

383
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,260
We waited and waited.

384
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:09,370
'What exactly are we waiting for?' asked MacDonald
finally. 'And how much longer do we have to

385
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,370
wait?'

386
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:16,940
'I don't know how long we'll have to wait
but I can tell you what we are waiting for.

387
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:23,250
Look - that's what we're waiting for!' As
he spoke, we saw a man open the window of

388
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:29,429
the study. We heard the splashing of water
as the man searched for something. Then suddenly

389
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:34,809
we saw him raise a large round object from
the moat and take it into the study.

390
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:37,179
'Now!' shouted Holmes. 'Now!'

391
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:41,919
We all jumped to our feet and ran into the
house and into the study: there was Cecil

392
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:42,919
Barker.

393
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,700
'What do you want?' he said.

394
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,750
'That's what we want,' said Holmes. 'That
package, weighted with the dumbbell that you

395
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,539
have just pulled from the moat.'

396
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:54,260
'How do you know about it?'

397
00:32:54,260 --> 00:33:01,000
'Well, I put it there,' said Holmes, 'or,
rather, I "replaced" it there after hooking

398
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,039
it out last night with the handle of Watson's
umbrella.'

399
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:13,600
He opened the package. Inside was a pair of
boots, a grey suit, a yellow coat and a dangerous-looking

400
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
knife.

401
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:21,519
'The label in the coat is from Vermissa, USA.
Earlier today, I found out that Vermissa is

402
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,730
a mining valley. Perhaps the V.V. on the card
might stand for Vermissa Valley and may even

403
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:34,100
be the Valley of Fear, I think. This seems
clear. Perhaps you could explain further,

404
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,049
Mr Barker?' asked Holmes.

405
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:44,970
Barker did not know what to say. Eventually
he said, 'Well, if you know such a lot, Holmes,

406
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,600
why don't you tell us?'

407
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:54,581
Mrs Douglas came in. She had heard everything.
'You have done enough for us, Cecil. Whatever

408
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:57,559
happens in the future, you have done enough.'

409
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:04,230
'More than enough,' said Holmes. 'Now I think
it is time to hear the truth from Mr Douglas

410
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,990
himself.'

411
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:11,710
We were all astonished at Holmes's words.
As he spoke, a man seemed to have come out

412
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:18,250
from the wall in a dark corner of the room.
Mrs Douglas turned and put her arms around

413
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,850
her husband.

414
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,359
'I'm sure it's best this way, John,' she said.

415
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,480
The man looked at us. He came to me and gave
me a package.

416
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,329
'I've heard of you,' he said. 'Well, Doctor
Watson, you've never heard a story like this

417
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:40,820
one. Tell it your own way, but these are the
facts. I've been hiding in there for two days

418
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:46,429
and I've written it all down. This is the
story of the Valley of Fear.'

419
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:50,530
MacDonald was staring at John Douglas in amazement.

420
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:56,840
'Well, if you're John Douglas, whose murder
have we been investigating for the past two

421
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,710
days? And where did you just come from?'

422
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:06,590
'Don't you remember me telling you that Charles
I was once hidden in this house?' Holmes reminded

423
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:12,440
him. 'When I found the clothes in the moat,
it became clear that the body was not that

424
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:19,079
of John Douglas, but must be the body of the
cyclist from Tunbridge Wells. So, then I had

425
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,589
to find out where Mr Douglas was hiding.'

426
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:28,359
'He's right. I won't start at the beginning,'
said John Douglas, 'but there are some men

427
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,910
who won't leave me alone until I'm dead. They
forced me out of America. I wanted to spend

428
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:39,599
my last years here in peace. I never told
my wife how things were because I didn't want

429
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,670
to worry her.

430
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:46,339
'I was in Tunbridge Wells the day before these
events, and I saw a man in the street who

431
00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:52,330
I recognised immediately. He was my worst
enemy, so I knew that there was trouble coming.

432
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:58,000
I came home and prepared myself. All day I
was nervous but when the drawbridge was up

433
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,660
I felt safe. Then, when I was checking the
lights before going to bed, I saw his boot

434
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,760
under the curtain. I put down the candle and
he jumped out at me and got the gun from under

435
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,510
his coat. We were fighting and I was trying
to take the gun out of his hands before he

436
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,320
could fire.

437
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,610
'Maybe it was me that pulled the trigger or
maybe it just went off in the fight. Anyway,

438
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:25,800
he took the shot full in the face. I was looking
at all that was left of Ted Baldwin. I was

439
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,260
in shock when I heard Barker and my wife coming.
I ran to the door and stopped her. We thought

440
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:36,190
that the servants would be there any minute.
But they didn't come. They hadn't heard anything.

441
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,980
That was when I thought of the plan.

442
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:43,660
'The man has the same mark as I have, the
mark of the lodge. He was also about the same

443
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:50,440
height and size as me. His face was unrecognizable.
We tied his clothes to the dumbbell and threw

444
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,140
them out of the window. Then we put my clothes
on him. The card that was meant for my body

445
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:01,910
was lying by his and we put my ring on his
finger. I didn't want to part with my wedding

446
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:07,510
ring, but as you can see, I can't get it off
anyway. I put a plaster on his chin where

447
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,550
I have one myself at the moment.

448
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:14,349
'I thought that if I could hide for a while,
we might, at last, have a chance to live the

449
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:19,790
rest of our lives in peace. So, I hid in the
hiding place and Barker did what he had to

450
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:25,480
do. He made the mark by the window and then,
when everything was fixed, he rang the bell

451
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,050
for the servants. That's the truth.'

452
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:36,500
Holmes looked serious. 'I don't think this
story is over yet, Mr Douglas. I see trouble

453
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,700
ahead.'

454
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:45,530
And now, let us go back twenty years in time
and travel thousands of miles to the west,

455
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:51,510
so that I can tell you the beginning of this
terrible story of John Douglas. And then,

456
00:37:51,510 --> 00:38:00,339
we will meet in the rooms of Baker Street
once more to hear how it ends.

457
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:03,660
PART TWO
CHAPTER ONE

458
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,470
Vermissa

459
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:13,329
It was 4th February, 1875. It was evening
and the train was travelling to Vermissa,

460
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:19,930
U.S.A., the small town at the top of the valley.
The train was full of miners, who had been

461
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:25,490
working all day. In the first carriage there
were also two policemen and one other young

462
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,850
man sitting alone.

463
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:34,030
He was about thirty years old, with brown
hair and grey eyes. He stared out of the window

464
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:41,720
into the darkness. At one point, he took a
large gun from his pocket. It was loaded.

465
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,869
He checked it quickly then replaced it, but
a miner sitting near him had noticed it.

466
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:50,550
'Oh!' he said. 'You seem ready for action.'

467
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:56,359
The young man smiled. 'Yes,' he said, 'we
need them sometimes where I come from.'

468
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:59,020
'And where's that?' asked the miner.

469
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,359
'Chicago,' answered the young man.

470
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,880
'You might find that you need it here too.'

471
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,560
'Is that right?' asked the young man, surprised.
'I'm looking for work here.'

472
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,270
'Do you have friends here?'

473
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:16,170
'No', but I can make them,' answered the young
man. 'I belong to the Ancient Order of Freemen.

474
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:21,070
There's no town without a lodge so I'll find
my friends there.'

475
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:26,540
The other man's manner changed. He got up,
came over to sit next to the young man and

476
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:31,080
held out his hand. The two men shook hands
in a special way.

477
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:36,599
'I see you're telling the truth,' said the
miner. Then he raised his right hand to his

478
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:42,400
right eyebrow. The young traveller raised
his left hand to his left eyebrow.

479
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,550
'Dark nights are unpleasant,' said the miner.

480
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,540
'Yes, for strangers to travel,' answered the
young man.

481
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:56,220
'That's good enough for me. I'm Brother Scanlan,
Lodge 341, Vermissa Valley. Welcome.'

482
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:04,020
'Thank you. I'm Brother Jack McMurdo, Lodge
29, Chicago, Master, J. H. Scott. I'm lucky

483
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,480
to meet a brother so early.'

484
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,580
'But why did you leave Chicago?' asked the
miner.

485
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,940
McMurdo nodded towards the policemen.

486
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,280
'They'd be very interested to know,' he said.
'But I don't really want to talk about it.

487
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,290
I've my own good reason for leaving Chicago.'

488
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,980
'Okay. Where are you going tonight?'

489
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,319
'To Vermissa.'

490
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:26,570
'That's the third stop. Where are you staying?'

491
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:29,860
'With Jacob Shafter, Sheridan Street.'

492
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:35,220
'Well, I'm getting off at the next stop. But
I'll give you some advice. If you're in trouble

493
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:41,869
in Vermissa, go and see Master McGinty. Maybe
we'll meet at the lodge one evening.' The

494
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:44,400
train stopped and the miner got off.

495
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,960
The train moved off.

496
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,250
'You're new around here then?' one of the
policemen asked McMurdo.

497
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,770
'What if I am?' he answered rudely.

498
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:58,420
'Just be careful who you choose to be your
friends. I wouldn't start with Mike Scanlan

499
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,150
and his gang if I were you.'

500
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:06,080
'What business is it of yours who my friends
are?' shouted McMurdo. Everyone looked round

501
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,740
at him. 'Did I ask for your advice?' The two
policemen were shocked.

502
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,060
'No offence, stranger. It was a warning, seeing
that you're new here.'

503
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:21,710
'I'm new here but I'm not new to you and your
kind,' shouted McMurdo. 'You're all the same,

504
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,579
giving your advice when nobody asks for it!'

505
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:29,920
'Well. We'll probably be seeing more of you
by the sound of it,' said one of the policemen.

506
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,730
'You're a troublemaker if ever I saw one!'
'I'm not afraid of you!' cried McMurdo. 'My

507
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:42,369
name's Jack McMurdo and if you want me, I'm
staying at Jacob Shafter's at Sheridan Street,

508
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:45,670
Vermissa, so I'm not hiding from you, am I?'

509
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:51,290
A few minutes later the train stopped at Vermissa
station and McMurdo and many of the other

510
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:57,050
workers got off the train. McMurdo was about
to walk off when one of the miners stopped

511
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,100
him.

512
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:04,160
'You really know how to talk to the police,'
he said admiringly. 'I'm passing by Shafter's

513
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,690
place. Let me carry your bag and I'll show
you where it is.'

514
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,810
Many of the other miners said goodnight as
they left. Before he had even arrived in the

515
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:20,780
town, Jack McMurdo had a reputation in Vermissa.
The two men walked along.

516
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:27,859
'That's the Union House,' said the miner pointing
to one of the bigger buildings. 'Jack McGinty

517
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:29,040
is the boss there.'

518
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,460
'What's he like?'

519
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:35,480
'Haven't you heard of him? He's been in the
papers often enough because of the Scowrers.'

520
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:43,600
'The Scowrers? Aren't they a group of murderers?'
asked McMurdo. 'Sssh!' cried the miner. 'You

521
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:49,240
won't last long here if you talk like that,
on the street so that anyone can hear you.

522
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:56,280
There are murders but McGinty's name mustn't
be connected with them. He hears everything.

523
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,350
Now, here's Jacob Shafter's house.'

524
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:05,750
'Thanks,' said McMurdo. He knocked on the
door.

525
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:12,970
It was opened by a beautiful young woman.
She was blonde with dark eyes. McMurdo stared

526
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,920
at her, lost for words.

527
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,600
She spoke first. 'I thought it was Father,'
she said. 'Are you looking for him? He'll

528
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,000
be back soon.'

529
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,880
'I'm in no hurry,' said McMurdo at last. 'But
I'm looking for a place to stay and your house

530
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,290
was recommended to me.'

531
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:36,650
'Well then come in, sir. I'm Ettie Shafter,
Mr Shafter's daughter. My mother's dead, so

532
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:42,770
I run the house. You can wait by the fire
for my father. Ah, here he is now.'

533
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:48,660
An old man walked slowly up the path. The
two men talked and Jack McMurdo agreed to

534
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,579
pay seven dollars a week to stay with them.

535
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:57,320
McMurdo quickly became popular at the Shafter's
house. Within a few days everyone knew who

536
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:03,240
he was and they liked and respected him. He
had also fallen in love with Shafter's daughter

537
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,619
Ettie and told her so everyday. He was determined
to marry her even though she told him that

538
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:16,859
she had already promised to marry someone
else.

539
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:22,579
CHAPTER TWO
Meeting Boss McGinty

540
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,250
One evening, Mike Scanlan came to see McMurdo.

541
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:32,060
'McMurdo, why haven't you been to introduce
yourself to Master McGinty?' he asked.

542
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:37,500
'I had to find a job,' replied McMurdo. 'I'm
working as a bookkeeper now.'

543
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,480
Scanlan seemed worried.

544
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,780
'But you have to see Boss McGinty,' he said.
'The lodge isn't the same here as it is in

545
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,089
Chicago. Go tonight.'

546
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:53,590
But someone else wanted to talk to McMurdo
that evening Mr Shafter called McMurdo into

547
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,660
his room and asked him about his feelings
for Ettie, his daughter.

548
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:05,380
'It's no good, McMurdo,' said the old man.
'Someone has got there before you.'

549
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:11,970
'Yes, Ettie told me so, but she won't tell
me his name. So who is it?' said McMurdo.

550
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:18,970
'It's one of the Scowrers,' said Shafter.
'His name is Teddy Baldwin.'

551
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:23,599
'Who are these Scowrers? Why are you all so
afraid of them?'

552
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,940
'The Scowrers are the Ancient Order of Freemen,'
replied the old man.

553
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,670
'But I belong to that order myself,' said
McMurdo.

554
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,560
'You! I wouldn't have let you into my house
if I had known that!'

555
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,369
'But why? The Order is for charity and friendship,
the rules say so.'

556
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:49,550
'Maybe in some places but not here,' said
the old man. 'Here they are a group of murderers.

557
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:54,119
It's bad enough that I have one of these people
coming after my Ettie and that I cannot say

558
00:45:54,119 --> 00:46:00,720
no to him. I won't have another one staying
in my house. You must leave!'

559
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,349
McMurdo went to see Ettie.

560
00:46:02,349 --> 00:46:08,390
'If I had been first Ettie, would I have had
a chance?' he asked her.

561
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:16,210
Ettie started crying. 'Things would have been
very different if you'd been the first,' she

562
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,210
cried.

563
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:23,210
'We can't be together because of a promise
to someone you don't love? That's wrong, Ettie.'

564
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:29,730
'But I'm afraid of him, Jack, both for myself
and my father. Can't we go away together somewhere

565
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,400
else? We can take Father with us!'

566
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,770
'I can't take you away, I can't leave here
yet. But I promise you, no harm will come

567
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:43,869
to you or your father. But you may find that
I am as bad as other men, Ettie,' said Jack.

568
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:49,390
'Oh no, Jack. I trust you,' replied the girl.

569
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:55,180
The door opened suddenly and a handsome young
man walked in. Ettie jumped to her feet looking

570
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,180
alarmed.

571
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:01,300
'I'm glad to see you, Mr Baldwin. You're early.
Please sit down.'

572
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,760
Mr Baldwin did not sit down. 'Who's he?' he
demanded.

573
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,790
Ettie explained that McMurdo was staying with
them.

574
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:15,670
'Well, McMurdo, this young lady is mine. Perhaps
she told you.'

575
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,510
'No, I didn't know there was anything between
you.'

576
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:25,030
'Well, you know now,' replied Baldwin. 'Perhaps
you're ready for a fight, Mr McMurdo?'

577
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:29,150
McMurdo jumped up. 'I am!' he cried. 'Come
on, outside!'

578
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:33,130
'Oh, Jack, Jack, be careful! He'll hurt you!'
cried Ettie.

579
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:39,940
'Oh, it's "Jack" is it? I see how it is. Well,
I'll sort this out without getting into a

580
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:45,510
fight.' He rolled up his sleeve and showed
McMurdo a strange mark on his arm. It was

581
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:49,470
a triangle inside a circle. 'Do you know what
that means?'

582
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,589
'I don't know and I don't care!'

583
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:57,710
'Well, you will know, I promise you that.
Perhaps Miss Ettie can tell you about it.

584
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:03,750
And you, girl, you'll come back to me, do
you hear?' He turned and left the house.

585
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:09,510
McMurdo decided to go straight down to the
Union House and introduce himself to Boss

586
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:14,930
McGinty, whose bar was crowded as usual. Boss
McGinty was not an honest man and he was getting

587
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:21,400
richer and richer. As a councilor, he controlled
taxes, roadwork's and various accounts for

588
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:28,900
the area. The citizens of Vermissa were blackmailed
into silence, scared that they might be killed.

589
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:34,740
McMurdo went into the bar. He saw a tall,
strong, heavy looking man with black hair

590
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:42,630
and a beard who had to be McGinty. He looked
friendly, but he had evil eyes. McMurdo walked

591
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:49,060
up to the man, looked him in the eye and introduced
himself. He made a signal so that McGinty

592
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,010
would know he was also a Freeman.

593
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:58,960
McGinty looked surprised, but then he took
McMurdo to a back room. He sat down and, without

594
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:06,080
saying a word, examined McMurdo carefully.
For a couple of minutes he sat in silence.

595
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,980
Then, suddenly, he pulled out a gun.

596
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:14,750
'If this is a game of yours, it won't last
long,' said McGinty dangerously.

597
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:20,230
'That is a strange welcome from one brother
to another,' replied McMurdo calmly.

598
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:25,920
'That's just what you have to prove - that
you really are a brother!'

599
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,550
McGinty then asked him some details about
where he was made a Freeman and the reason

600
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:37,780
why he had left Chicago. McMurdo gave him
a page from a newspaper. McGinty read it quickly;

601
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:43,230
it was about the shooting of a man called
Jonas Pinto in the Lake Bar in Chicago in

602
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,260
January 1874.

603
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:49,000
'Did you shoot this man?' asked McGinty. 'Why?'

604
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,640
'I was making fake dollars. This man Pinto
was helping me; then he said he wanted to

605
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:00,170
go to the police. Maybe he did but I didn't
wait to see. I just shot him and came down

606
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,170
here.'

607
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:06,920
'So can you still make these fake dollars?'
asked McGinty. McMurdo gave him a handful

608
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:13,010
of notes. 'Well, these aren't real,' he said.
At this moment, Ted Baldwin walked in.

609
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:18,589
'So, you got here first, McMurdo,' he said
angrily.

610
00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:24,710
Boss McGinty wanted to know what the problem
was. McMurdo told him about Ettie.

611
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:28,800
'She's free to choose for herself,' he finished.

612
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,520
'Between two brothers of the lodge, she certainly
is,' agreed McGinty.

613
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:39,320
'And that's your answer?' shouted Ted Baldwin.
'You've known me for years and now you take

614
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,119
the side of this newcomer?'

615
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,970
McGinty jumped on him like a tiger. He grabbed
his neck and threw him across the room.

616
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:52,750
'While I'm the Master of this lodge, you had
better accept my rules,' he shouted.

617
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,140
Ted Baldwin nodded.

618
00:50:54,140 --> 00:51:00,309
'So we're all friends, right?' said McGinty.
'And there's an end to the matter.'

619
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:11,270
Ted Baldwin was back on his feet. He nodded
again but he did not look happy.

620
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:18,770
CHAPTER THREE
Lodge 341, Vermissa

621
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:24,800
The next day, McMurdo moved from Jacob Shafter's
and went to stay with Mrs MacNamara, who was

622
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:32,160
a widow. Scanlan now also worked in Vermissa
and so he stayed at the same house. McMurdo

623
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,140
was still allowed to go for meals with the
Shafters, so his relationship with Ettie continued

624
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,130
to develop.

625
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:44,720
One Saturday night, McMurdo was made a full
brother of the lodge in Vermissa. He was warned

626
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:50,589
that something might happen to him but he
did not know what it was. Many men had gathered

627
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:56,849
for the ceremony. McMurdo was tied up and
blindfolded. Then they took off his coat and

628
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:59,750
rolled up the sleeve on his right arm.

629
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:05,819
It was very dark and McMurdo could hear the
voices of the men around him. Then he heard

630
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:07,710
Boss McGinty's voice.

631
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:13,609
'Jack McMurdo, are you a member of the Ancient
Order of Freemen?' McMurdo nodded.

632
00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:19,780
'Are you from Lodge No. 29, Chicago?' Again
McMurdo nodded.

633
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,690
'Are you ready to be tested?' asked McGinty.

634
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,180
'I am,' replied McMurdo.

635
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,859
'Very well.'

636
00:52:27,859 --> 00:52:34,589
McMurdo wanted to cry out because of the terrible
pain in his arm. He felt faint but he bit

637
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:37,140
his lip and he did not cry out.

638
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:45,910
'I can take more than that,' he said. There
was loud applause. 'I welcome you to Lodge

639
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:52,630
341, Vermissa. Let's drink to our new brother!'
said McGinty.

640
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:58,000
McMurdo took off his blindfold and examined
his arm. There was a circle with a triangle

641
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,369
in it, burnt deep and red onto his arm.

642
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:07,450
'So, now to business,' said McGinty. 'How
is our bank balance?'

643
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:12,840
And so McMurdo learnt of the way this community
worked. Small companies gave money to the

644
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:18,780
Order so that they were protected. If they
did not give money, machinery went wrong,

645
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:24,700
buildings burnt down and men were murdered.
Nothing could be proved against the Order

646
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:29,540
as most of the policemen were paid by the
society and the others were too scared to

647
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:34,380
do anything. Nobody wanted to give evidence
against the Order.

648
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:40,000
But towards the end of the meeting, another
man spoke. Brother Morris told them of how

649
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,910
one large company had forced - all the smaller
companies out of the valley and bought their

650
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:46,910
businesses.

651
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:52,660
'I don't see that it matters to us who has
bought the businesses, Brother Morris,' said

652
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,250
Boss McGinty.

653
00:53:54,250 --> 00:54:00,960
But Brother Morris continued. 'With respect,
sir, I think it will matter very much to us

654
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:08,170
in the future. If big companies like the Railroad
or General Iron own large parts of this valley,

655
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:14,359
and their bosses are in New York or Philadelphia,
they won't care about our threats. The small

656
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:20,859
men can't harm us. They haven't the money
or the power. But if these big companies find

657
00:54:20,859 --> 00:54:27,220
that we are stopping their profits, they won't
stop until they have brought us to justice.'

658
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,380
But McGinty took no notice of Brother Morris.

659
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:36,401
'I expect the big companies will find it easier
to pay than to fight, the same as the small

660
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:42,170
companies,' he said. 'And now, let's drink.'

661
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:47,650
There was one last piece of business to be
sorted out that night. The editor of the local

662
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:54,020
newspaper, the Herald, had recently printed
an article criticizing the lodge. His name

663
00:54:54,020 --> 00:55:02,430
was James Stanger. The headline was 'Reign
of Terror in the Coal and Iron District'.

664
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:06,920
McGinty read the article to the men, who were
by now drunk and restless.

665
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:13,010
'That's what he says about us. Now what shall
we say to him?' he shouted.

666
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,860
'Kill him!' shouted back many voices.

667
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:22,820
'No, we must be careful. But he must get a
severe warning,' ordered McGinty. 'Who will

668
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,950
go this evening?'

669
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:29,089
Ted Baldwin volunteered, with five or six
other men.

670
00:55:29,089 --> 00:55:35,710
'Take our new brother with you,' added McGinty.
Baldwin did not look pleased. 'You can come

671
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:39,220
if you want,' he said to McMurdo.

672
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:45,990
It was a very cold night. The men walked through
the town and stopped outside a high building.

673
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:53,480
'You stay down here, McMurdo. Watch the door,'
said Baldwin. 'You others come with me.'

674
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:59,430
The men went in and up some stairs. From the
room above came a cry for help, then the sound

675
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:05,970
of crashing chairs. A gray-haired old man
rushed out of the room. He was grabbed before

676
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:11,690
he could go any further and his glasses came
falling down the stairs to McMurdo's feet.

677
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:17,339
The old man was on his face and the men hit
him again and again with sticks. The others

678
00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:22,690
stopped, but Baldwin kept attacking the old
man, who was now covered in blood.

679
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:25,059
McMurdo went up and pulled Baldwin away.

680
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:29,520
'Leave it! You'll kill the man! The boss said
that we shouldn't kill him and look what you're

681
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,940
doing! We'd better go home.'

682
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,170
The others agreed with McMurdo.

683
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:38,690
Hurry! said one of the men. 'There are lights
coming on. All the town will be here in a

684
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,510
minute. Run!'

685
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:45,470
They left the beaten body of the editor on
the stairs and moved quickly away up the streets

686
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:51,470
and back to their homes.

687
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:56,859
CHAPTER FOUR
The Valley of Fear

688
00:56:56,859 --> 00:57:02,359
When McMurdo woke up the next morning, his
head ached and his arm was very painful from

689
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:08,680
the mark. Because he had his own illegal way
of making money, he did not always go to work

690
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:15,150
and this morning was one of those times. He
sat and read the paper. There was an article

691
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:22,770
about last night's events. 'Editor Seriously
Injured at the Herald Office' was the headline.

692
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:29,250
McMurdo put down the newspaper. The landlady
bought him a note. It read 'I want to speak

693
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:37,240
to you. Meet me on Miller Hill. I have something
important to tell you.' The note was not signed.

694
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,910
McMurdo was surprised but decided to go.

695
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:44,260
When he got to the hill, Brother Morris was
waiting for him.

696
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:49,660
'I wanted to ask you something. But please
don't tell Boss McGinty. When you joined the

697
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:55,330
Freemen's Society did you think that it would
lead you to a life of crime?' he asked.

698
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:59,290
'If you call it crime,' said McMurdo. 'Some
call it war.'

699
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:06,119
'Of course it's crime,' cried Morris. 'When
I arrived here, I wanted to do the best for

700
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:11,920
myself and my family. But then I was forced
to join the lodge and ordered to carry out

701
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:20,559
a murder. I went but I couldn't do it. But
it made me a criminal. I was a good Catholic

702
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:26,890
but now the priest will no longer speak to
me. I see you going the same way. Can't we

703
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:29,079
do anything to stop it?'

704
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:34,640
'What are you going to do?' asked McMurdo.
'I think you're making too much of this.'

705
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:41,310
'Too much? Wait until you've been here longer.
Then you'll understand how it is. There is

706
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:50,369
a cloud over this valley, a cloud of murder.
It is the Valley of Fear, the Valley of Death.

707
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:55,670
These people are terrified from morning until
night. Wait and you'll see.'

708
00:58:55,670 --> 00:59:00,460
'I'll tell you when I've seen more. You're
not the man for this place, that's clear.

709
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:06,150
Why don't you sell your business and leave?
What you have said is safe with me. I'm going

710
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:07,150
now.'

711
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:13,569
'Just one thing. Perhaps someone has seen
us together. McGinty will want to know what

712
00:59:13,569 --> 00:59:18,559
we're talking about. Tell him that I offered
you a job in my shop.'

713
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:24,369
'Good thinking. And I refused your offer.
Goodbye Brother Morris.'

714
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:31,030
The same afternoon, McGinty came to McMurdo's
house and asked why he had been with Morris.

715
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:36,820
McMurdo told him the story. 'Did Morris say
anything against the lodge?' asked McGinty.

716
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:42,720
McMurdo told him that he had not. Just as
McGinty was about to leave, the door crashed

717
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,570
open and Captain Marvin of the police walked
in with two other policemen.

718
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:51,579
'You're coming with me, McMurdo. Take his
gun,' said Marvin.

719
00:59:51,579 --> 00:59:54,359
'What have I done?' asked McMurdo.

720
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:57,500
'You can't do this,' said McGinty.

721
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:02,550
'You stay out of this, Councillor,' said the
policeman. Then he turned to McMurdo. 'You

722
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:06,960
were involved in the beating of Mr Stanger
at the Herald office last night.'

723
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:13,520
'Well, he can't have been,' said McGinty.
'This man was at my bar all night playing

724
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,990
cards with me.'

725
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:21,700
'Well, we'll see about that in court,' replied
Marvin. 'Come on, you're coming with me.'

726
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:27,579
But the Freemen had power even over the courts.
The next morning in court, the witnesses were

727
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:33,619
uncertain as to the identity of the men who
had attacked Mr Stanger. Stanger himself said

728
01:00:33,619 --> 01:00:40,670
that he was so taken by surprise that he did
not see his attackers. McMurdo was released.

729
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:46,020
The court was full of brothers who cheered
and applauded. But there were others there

730
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:53,160
who looked less happy. One man shouted as
they went out, 'You murderers! We'll catch

731
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,500
you yet!'

732
01:00:54,500 --> 01:01:00,260
McMurdo's arrest made him even more popular
in Vermissa. Only Ted Baldwin and a few other

733
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:06,089
members of the lodge did not like him. But
McMurdo also lost favour with another person

734
01:01:06,089 --> 01:01:13,609
far more important to him: Ettie. Her father
wanted nothing to do with him. Ettie was very

735
01:01:13,609 --> 01:01:18,760
much in love with McMurdo but her common sense
told her that it was better not to marry a

736
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:25,309
criminal. She decided to go and see him one
last time, to try to get him away from the

737
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:27,119
evil influence of the lodge.

738
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:32,160
'But you don't know what you're asking me!
Do you think the lodge will let a man go free

739
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,740
knowing all its secrets?'

740
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:39,270
'But I've thought of that. Father has some
money saved up and he is ready to leave this

741
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:43,119
place. Let's go together to New York or Philadelphia.'

742
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:48,119
'But they have lodges there too. We can't
get away that easily,' said McMurdo.

743
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:53,720
'Well, to England or Sweden or anywhere to
get away from this Valley of Fear!'

744
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:58,359
'Look, Ettie, the best I can say is that in
six months or so, I'll find a way so that

745
01:01:58,359 --> 01:02:01,170
we can leave here with no problems.'

746
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:06,339
'Really? Six months?' Ettie was happy. 'Is
that a promise?'

747
01:02:06,339 --> 01:02:10,099
'I promise,' said McMurdo.

748
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:15,539
Life in the valley continued as before. The
Scowrers murdered people and terrorized the

749
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:22,039
district. McMurdo was given a job of his own
to do; he had to blow up the house of a man

750
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:28,329
named Chester Wilcox. There was no other way
of doing it except at night when his wife

751
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:35,190
and two small children were also in the house.
McMurdo set the explosives and the house blew

752
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:41,291
up. However, someone had told Wilcox that
he was in danger, and the night before the

753
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:47,859
explosion he and his family moved to a safe
place. But in general, life had never seemed

754
01:02:47,859 --> 01:02:52,270
so hopeless and dark in the Valley of Fear.

755
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:56,829
One Saturday evening in May, Brother Morris
came to see McMurdo again.

756
01:02:56,829 --> 01:03:03,190
'I must speak to you,' he said. 'I spoke to
you once before and you didn't tell McGinty

757
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:08,220
so I know I can trust you. I have something
to tell you.'

758
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:14,220
The man was white and shaking. McMurdo gave
him some whisky and waited.

759
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:21,809
'There's a detective after us,' he said. 'You've
heard of Pinkerton's? When they send a man

760
01:03:21,809 --> 01:03:29,049
after you, they don't stop until they have
what they want. The lodge will be finished.'

761
01:03:29,049 --> 01:03:34,530
'We must kill him,' said McMurdo at once.
'Who is he? Where is he? How do you know about

762
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:36,840
him? Tell me the facts.'

763
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:44,260
Morris answered all McMurdo's questions. 'His
name is Birdy Edwards, but here he is using

764
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:52,599
Steve Wilson as his name. He's staying in
Hobson's Patch. I know because I have a friend

765
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:58,599
who works for the telegraph service. He told
me about him. Those big corporations have

766
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:02,080
hired Pinkerton's best man!'

767
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,589
'Leave this to me,' said McMurdo. 'Don't worry.'

768
01:04:06,589 --> 01:04:11,859
McMurdo went to the Shafter's. He told Ettie
the news and asked her if she was willing

769
01:04:11,859 --> 01:04:14,440
to go with him when the time came to leave.

770
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:24,070
'Day or night, Jack, I'll be ready when you
come for me,' she said.

771
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:27,540
CHAPTER FIVE
Birdy Edwards's Trap

772
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:36,299
Later that evening, McMurdo went to the lodge.
As it was Saturday, the brothers were already

773
01:04:36,299 --> 01:04:39,060
there. Jack went to his seat.

774
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:42,670
'Master,' he said. 'I have urgent news.'

775
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:45,990
McMurdo told them what he knew and what he
planned to do about it.

776
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:49,500
'There's only one answer,' said McMurdo.

777
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:56,901
'Birdy Edwards must never leave the valley,'
said Baldwin. 'Exactly,' agreed McMurdo. 'Here's

778
01:04:56,901 --> 01:04:59,119
what we'll do.'

779
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:06,200
He told them his plan. Birdy Edwards was pretending
to be a journalist called Steve Wilson. He

780
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:12,380
had spoken to McMurdo, offering him money
for information on the Scowrers. McMurdo had

781
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:18,380
told him some stories that he had made up
and Wilson gave him twenty dollars. Wilson

782
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:24,140
offered him more money for more information.
McMurdo arranged for Wilson to come to his

783
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:30,730
house so that he could tell him all the secrets
of the lodge in exchange for more money. Wilson

784
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:38,130
was to come to Mrs MacNamara's house at ten
o'clock. The house was isolated and Mrs MacNamara

785
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:43,460
did not hear very well. Seven of the other
Freemen were to come to the house at nine

786
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:46,720
o'clock, ready for Mr Wilson.

787
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:53,580
'Once we get the door shut behind him, that'll
be the end of Birdy Edwards,' said McMurdo.

788
01:05:53,580 --> 01:06:00,190
McMurdo returned home and prepared for the
evening ahead. He cleaned and oiled his gun.

789
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:06,430
He spoke to Scanlan who was also staying at
the house. Although he was a Scowrer, Scanlan

790
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:12,480
did not like what the men did. McMurdo told
him to go out that evening and stay away until

791
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,119
the morning.

792
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:21,010
The seven Freemen, including Boss McGinty,
arrived at nine o'clock. McMurdo put the whisky

793
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:26,420
on the table and the men began to drink, ready
for the job that was ahead of them.

794
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:31,079
'Maybe he won't come, maybe he knows there's
danger,' said one of the men.

795
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:35,040
'Don't worry, he'll come,' said McMurdo. 'Listen!'

796
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:38,039
There were three loud knocks on the door.

797
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:45,650
'Be quiet!' whispered McMurdo to the others.
He went down the passage to the door. The

798
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:52,460
others heard McMurdo open the door, then an
unfamiliar voice. Then they heard the door

799
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:59,720
close. Birdy Edwards was inside. The door
opened and McMurdo reappeared. He came to

800
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:04,930
the end of the table and looked at the men.
He said nothing.

801
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:08,819
'Well,' said McGinty impatiently, 'is he here?'

802
01:07:08,819 --> 01:07:16,900
'Yes,' replied McMurdo slowly. 'Birdy Edwards
is here. I am Birdy Edwards!'

803
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:22,700
The room was silent. Then the windows were
suddenly broken and guns were pointing in

804
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:30,130
through them. McGinty jumped up from his chair
and ran for the door, but Captain Marvin of

805
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:33,160
the police appeared and pointed his gun at
him.

806
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,859
'Stay where you are, McGinty,' said the man
they had known as McMurdo. 'Take their guns,

807
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:38,859
Marvin!'

808
01:07:38,859 --> 01:07:43,710
The men could do nothing. They were trapped.
They sat around the table, staring at McMurdo

809
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,970
with confusion and hatred in their eyes.

810
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:51,970
'I'd like to speak to you before we leave,'
said the man who had trapped them. 'I am Birdy

811
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:57,540
Edwards of Pinkerton's Detective Agency. I
was chosen to break up your gang. It's taken

812
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:03,380
me a long time and it's been hard and dangerous,
but I've won! Maybe you think the game isn't

813
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:10,289
over yet. I'll take my chances. You and sixty
more of you will be in prison tonight. Before

814
01:08:10,289 --> 01:08:15,470
I took this job, I never believed that there
was a society like yours. In Chicago, the

815
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:20,839
society of Freemen weren't bad men. I never
killed a man in Chicago, I never printed any

816
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:26,290
false money. I gave Chester Wilcox a warning
so that when I blew up his house, he and his

817
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:27,900
family were already gone.'

818
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:31,150
'You traitor!' shouted McGinty.

819
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:35,170
'You can call me a traitor, but there are
many people in this valley who will call me

820
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:41,000
a savior. I've been here three months in order
to get to know every man and every secret.

821
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,520
I never want to live another three months
like it, not for all the money in the world.

822
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,040
Now, Captain Marvin, take them away.'

823
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:54,290
Scanlan had delivered a note to Ettie and
her father. The two left the Valley of Fear

824
01:08:54,290 --> 01:09:01,900
and never went back. Ten days later, Ettie
and Birdy Edwards were married in Chicago.

825
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:08,089
The trial of the Scowrers was held and McGinty
was hanged, along with eight others. Many

826
01:09:08,089 --> 01:09:12,980
other men went to prison. Birdy Edwards's
job was done.

827
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:20,940
But, as he had thought, it was not over. Ted
Baldwin was not sentenced to death. He was

828
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:26,400
in prison for ten years, but when he came
out, he spent all his time looking for Birdy

829
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:33,190
Edwards. Birdy Edwards changed his name again
and moved to California and it was there that

830
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:38,941
Ettie Edwards died. He took the name John
Douglas and was nearly killed when he was

831
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:45,150
working in the mining industry with an English
partner named Barker. A warning came just

832
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:51,350
in time and Douglas left for England, where
he married for the second time. And so we

833
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:56,840
return to Sussex, and the fate of John Douglas.

834
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:03,360
At the trial, John Douglas was freed for having
acted in self-defense. But Holmes's advice

835
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,240
was to leave England.

836
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:12,380
Two months had gone by and we had nearly forgotten
about the case. But then, one night, a message

837
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:24,800
arrived for Holmes. All it said was 'Dear
me, Mr Holmes! Dear me!' It was from Moriarty.

838
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:31,030
Holmes looked very serious. Later that night,
Cecil Barker came to visit us.

839
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:34,820
'I have very bad news, Mr Holmes,' he said.

840
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:38,480
'I thought so,' said Holmes.

841
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:43,719
'It's poor Douglas. They tell me his real
name is Edwards, but he'll always be Douglas

842
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:48,920
to me. I told you that they left for South
Africa three weeks ago?'

843
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,920
Holmes nodded.

844
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:57,440
'I received this message from Mrs Douglas
last night: "John has been lost overboard.

845
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:01,640
No one knows how the accident occurred. Ivy
Douglas".'

846
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:04,520
'It was no accident,' said Holmes.

847
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:10,350
'He was murdered? These Scowrers, these criminals,
why couldn't they leave him alone-'

848
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:17,750
'No, no,' interrupted Holmes. 'There has been
a master at work here. This is the work of

849
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:19,060
Moriarty.'

850
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:21,870
'But what has he to do with all this?'

851
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:28,000
'The Americans had a job to do in England.
Like any other criminals they asked Moriarty

852
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,960
for help. From that moment, John Douglas was
doomed.'

853
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:39,060
'But what can be done? Can't this Moriarty
be stopped?' asked Barker.

854
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:48,480
'Oh yes,' said Holmes, 'he can be stopped
- I just need more time.'

855
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:56,180
- THE END -
