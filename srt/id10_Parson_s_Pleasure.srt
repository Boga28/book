1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,500
Mr Boggis was driving the car slowly, leaning
back comfortably in the seat with one elbow

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,410
resting on the sill of the open window.

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,170
How beautiful the countryside, he thought;
how pleasant to see a sign or two of summer

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,210
once again.

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,380
The primroses especially.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,610
And the hawthorn.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,870
The hawthorn was exploding white and pink
and red along the hedges and the primroses

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,059
were growing underneath in little clumps,
and it was beautiful.

9
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,810
He took one hand off the wheel and lit himself
a cigarette.

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,280
The best thing now, he told himself, would
be to make for the top of Brill Hill.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,930
He could see it about half a mile ahead.

12
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,549
And that must be the village of Brill, that
cluster of cottages among the trees right

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,180
on the very summit.

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,180
Excellent.

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:57,250
Not many of his Sunday sections had a nice
elevation like that to work from.

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,710
He drove up the hill and stopped the car just
short of the summit on the outskirts of the

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,760
village.

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,360
Then he got out and looked around.

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,380
Down below, the countryside was spread out
before him like a huge green carpet.

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,170
He could see for miles.

21
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,770
It was perfect.

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,659
He took a pad and pencil from his pocket,
leaned against the back of the car, and allowed

23
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,920
his practiced eye to travel slowly over the
landscape.

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,109
He could see one medium farmhouse over on
the right, back in the fields, with a track

25
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:30,259
leading to it from the road.

26
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:32,960
There was another larger one beyond it.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,270
There was a house surrounded by tall elms
that looked as though it might be a Queen

28
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,999
Anne, and there were two likely farms away
over on the left.

29
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:43,499
Five places in all.

30
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:46,220
That was about the lot in this direction.

31
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:51,259
Mr Boggis drew a rough sketch on his pad showing
the position of each so that he'd be able

32
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:56,350
to find them easily when he was down below,
then he got back into the car and drove up

33
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,530
through the village to the other side of the
hill.

34
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:06,439
From there he spotted six more possibles - five
farms and one big white Georgian house.

35
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,369
He studied the Georgian house through his
binoculars.

36
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:13,700
It had a clean prosperous look, and the garden
was well ordered.

37
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,260
That was a pity.

38
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,270
He ruled it out immediately.

39
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,760
There was no point in calling on the prosperous.

40
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,580
In this square then, in this section, there
were ten possibles in all.

41
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,319
Ten was a nice number, Mr Boggis told himself.

42
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,879
Just the right amount for a leisurely afternoon's
work.

43
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,530
What time was it now?

44
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,819
Twelve o'clock.

45
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,950
He would have liked a pint of beer in the
pub before he started, but on Sundays they

46
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,720
didn't open until one.

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,470
Very well, he would have it later.

48
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,590
He glanced at the notes on his pad.

49
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,480
He decided to take the Queen Anne first, the
house with the elms.

50
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,700
It had looked nicely dilapidated through the
binoculars.

51
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,260
The people there could probably do with some
money.

52
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,239
He was always lucky with Queen Annes, anyway.

53
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,940
Mr Boggis climbed back into the car, released
the handbrake, and began cruising slowly down

54
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,270
the hill without the engine.

55
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,439
Apart from the fact that he was at this moment
disguised in the uniform of a clergyman, there

56
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,000
was nothing very sinister about Mr Cyril Boggis.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,160
By trade he was a dealer in antique furniture,
with his own shop and showroom in the King's

58
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,550
Road, Chelsea.

59
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:31,221
His premises were not large, and generally
he didn't do a great deal of business, but

60
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:37,730
because he always bought cheap, very very
cheap, and sold very very dear, he managed

61
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,750
to make quite a tidy little income every year.

62
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,360
He was a talented salesman, and when buying
or selling a piece he could slide smoothly

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,640
into whichever mood suited the client best.

64
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:56,090
He could become grave and charming for the
aged, obsequious for the rich, sober for the

65
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:03,320
godly, masterful for the weak, mischievous
for the widow, arch and saucy for the spinster.

66
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,560
He was well aware of his gift, using it shamelessly
on every possible occasion; and often, at

67
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,609
the end of an unusually good performance,
it was as much as he could do to prevent himself

68
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:19,829
from turning aside and taking a bow or two
as the thundering applause of the audience

69
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,940
went rolling through the theatre.

70
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:27,540
In spite of this rather clownish quality of
his, Mr Boggis was not a fool.

71
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,050
In fact, it was said of him by some that he
probably knew as much about French, English,

72
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,640
and Italian furniture as anyone else in London.

73
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:43,290
He also had surprisingly good taste, and he
was quick to recognize and reject an ungraceful

74
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,570
design, however genuine the article might
be.

75
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:52,730
His real love, naturally, was for the work
of the great eighteenth-century English designers,

76
00:04:52,730 --> 00:05:01,090
Ince, Mayhew, Chippendale, Robert Adam, Manwaring,
Inigo Jones, Hepplewhite, Kent, Johnson, George

77
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,470
Smith, Lock, Sheraton, and the rest of them,
but even with these he occasionally drew the

78
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,470
line.

79
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,540
He refused, for example, to allow a single
piece from Chippendale's Chinese or Gothic

80
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,950
period to come into his showroom, and the
same was true of some of the heavier Italian

81
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,860
designs of Robert Adam.

82
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,740
During the past few years, Mr Boggis had achieved
considerable fame among his friends in the

83
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:34,290
trade by his ability to produce unusual and
often quite rare items with astonishing regularity.

84
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:40,280
Apparently the man had a source of supply
that was almost inexhaustible, a sort of private

85
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,710
warehouse, and it seemed' that all he had
to do was to drive out to it once a week and

86
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,710
help himself.

87
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:52,510
Whenever they asked him where he got the stuff,
he would smile knowingly and wink and murmur

88
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:58,150
something about a little secret.

89
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:03,880
The idea behind Mr Boggis's little secret
was a simple one, and it had come to him as

90
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,720
a result of something that had happened on
a certain Sunday afternoon nearly nine years

91
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,200
before, while he was driving in the country.

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,280
He had gone out in the morning to visit his
old mother, who lived in Seven-oaks, and on

93
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,130
the way back the fan belt on his car had broken,
causing the engine to overheat and the water

94
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,850
to boil away.

95
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,590
He had got out of the car and walked to the
nearest house, a smallish farm building about

96
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,580
fifty yards off the road, and had asked the
woman who answered the door if he could please

97
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,370
have a jug of water.

98
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,000
While he was waiting for her to fetch it,
he happened to glance in through the door

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,800
to the living-room, and there, not five yards
from where he was standing, he spotted something

100
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,530
that made him so excited the sweat began to
come out all over the top of his head.

101
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:58,840
It was a large oak armchair of a type that
he had only seen once before in his life.

102
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Each arm, as well as the panel at the back,
was supported by a row of eight beautifully

103
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,700
turned spindles.

104
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,750
The back panel itself was decorated by an
inlay of the most delicate floral design,

105
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,520
and the head of a duck was carved to lie along
half the length of either arm.

106
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,030
Good God, he thought.

107
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,160
This thing is late fifteenth century!

108
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,690
He poked his head in further through the door,
and there, by heavens, was another of them

109
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,430
on the other side of the fireplace!

110
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:34,940
He couldn't be sure, but two chairs like that
must be worth at least a thousand pounds up

111
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,940
in London.

112
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,770
And oh, what beauties they were!

113
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:44,340
When the woman returned, Mr Boggis introduced
himself and straight away asked if she would

114
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,870
like to sell her chairs.

115
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,510
'Dear me,' she said.

116
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,910
'But why on earth should she want to sell
her chairs?'

117
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,680
'No reason at all, except that he might be
willing to give her a pretty nice price.'

118
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,420
'And how much would he give?'

119
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,610
'They were definitely not for sale, but just
out of curiosity, just for fun, you know,

120
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,140
how much would he give?'

121
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,720
'Thirty-five pounds.'

122
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,300
'How much?'

123
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,880
'Thirty-five pounds.'

124
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,040
'Dear me, thirty-five pounds.

125
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,310
Well, well, that was very interesting.'

126
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,050
She'd always thought they were valuable.

127
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,500
They were very old.

128
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,310
They were very comfortable too.

129
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,140
She couldn't possibly do without them, not
possibly.

130
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,650
No, they were not for sale but thank you very
much all the same.

131
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,090
They weren't really so very old, Mr Boggis
told her, and they wouldn't be at all easy

132
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:39,979
to sell, but it just happened that he had
a client who rather liked that sort of thing.

133
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,039
Maybe he could go up another two pounds - call
it thirty-seven.

134
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,550
How about that?

135
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,900
They bargained for half an hour, and of course
in the end Mr Boggis got the chairs and agreed

136
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,319
to pay her something less than a twentieth
of their value.

137
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:01,889
That evening, driving back to London in his
old station-wagon with the two fabulous chairs

138
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:07,360
tucked away snugly in the back, Mr Boggis
had suddenly been struck by what seemed to

139
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,620
him to be a most remarkable idea.

140
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,690
Look here, he said.

141
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,430
If there is good stuff in one farmhouse, then
why not in others?

142
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,259
Why shouldn't he search for it?

143
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,949
Why shouldn't he comb the countryside?

144
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:23,720
He could do it on Sundays.

145
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,660
In that way, it wouldn't interfere with his
work at all.

146
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,620
He never knew what to do with his Sundays.

147
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,480
So Mr Boggis bought maps, large-scale maps
of all the counties around London, and with

148
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,629
a fine pen he divided each of them up into
a series of squares.

149
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:45,779
Each of these squares covered an actual area
of five miles by five, which was about as

150
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:51,639
much territory, he estimated, as he could
cope with on a single Sunday, were he to comb

151
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,639
it thoroughly.

152
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,680
He didn't want the towns and the villages.

153
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,870
It was the comparatively isolated places,
the large farmhouses and the rather dilapidated

154
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,589
country mansions, that he was looking for;
and in this way, if he did one square each

155
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:12,139
Sunday, fifty-two squares a year, he would
gradually cover every farm and every country

156
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:16,940
house in the home counties.

157
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,310
But obviously there was a bit more to it than
that.

158
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,240
Country folk are a suspicious lot.

159
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,380
So are the impoverished rich.

160
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,230
You can't go about ringing their bells and
expecting them to show you around their houses

161
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,230
just for the asking, because they won't do
it.

162
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,160
That way you would never get beyond the front
door.

163
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,870
How then was he to gain admittance?

164
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,990
Perhaps it would be best if he didn't let
them know he was a dealer at all.

165
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,980
He could be the telephone man, the plumber,
the gas inspector.

166
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,480
He could even be a clergyman...

167
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,600
From this point on, the whole scheme began
to take on a more practical aspect.

168
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,850
Mr Boggis ordered a large quantity of superior
cards on which the following legend was engraved:

169
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,180
THE REVEREND
CYRIL WINNINGTON BOGGIS

170
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:11,980
President of the Society for the Preservation
of Rare Furniture In association with The

171
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,680
Victoria and Albert Museum

172
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,790
From now on, every Sunday, he was going to
be a nice old parson spending his holiday

173
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:27,069
travelling around on a labor of love for the
'Society', compiling an inventory of the treasures

174
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:30,740
that lay hidden in the country homes of England.

175
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,139
And who in the world was going to kick him
out when they heard that one?

176
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:36,139
Nobody.

177
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:42,120
And then, once he was inside, if he happened
to spot something he really wanted, well - he

178
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,009
knew a hundred different ways of dealing with
that.

179
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:49,330
Rather to Mr Boggis's surprise, the scheme
worked.

180
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,949
In fact, the friendliness with which he was
received in one house after another through

181
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:59,089
the countryside was, in the beginning, quite
embarrassing, even to him.

182
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:06,809
A slice of cold pie, a glass of port, a cup
of tea, a basket of plums, even a full sit-down

183
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:12,439
Sunday dinner with the family, such things
were constantly being pressed upon him.

184
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:16,980
Sooner or later, of course, there had been
some bad moments and a number of unpleasant

185
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,459
incidents, but then nine years is more than
four hundred Sundays, and that adds up to

186
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,220
a great quantity of houses visited.

187
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:35,129
All in all, it had been an interesting, exciting,
and lucrative business.

188
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:40,680
And now it was another Sunday and Mr Boggis
was operating in the county of Buckinghamshire,

189
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,769
in one of the most northerly squares on his
map, about ten miles from Oxford, and as he

190
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:51,370
drove down the hill and headed for his first
house, the dilapidated Queen Anne, he began

191
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,019
to get the feeling that this was going to
be one of his lucky days.

192
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:00,829
He parked the car about a hundred yards from
the gates and got out to walk the rest of

193
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:01,910
the way.

194
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,920
He never liked people to see his car until
after a deal was completed.

195
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,920
A dear old clergyman and a large station-wagon
somehow never seemed quite right together.

196
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,249
Also the short walk gave him time to examine
the property closely from the outside and

197
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:22,649
to assume the mood most likely to be suitable
for the occasion.

198
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,579
Mr Boggis strode briskly up the drive.

199
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:28,220
He was a small fat-legged man with a belly.

200
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:34,720
The face was round and rosy, quite perfect
for the part, and the two large brown eyes

201
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,120
that bulged out at you from this rosy face
gave an impression of gentle imbecility.

202
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,910
He was dressed in a black suit with the usual
parson's dog- collar round his neck, and on

203
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,619
his head a soft black hat.

204
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:55,300
He carried an old oak walking-stick which
lent him, in his opinion, a rather rustic

205
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,449
easy-going air.

206
00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:00,749
He approached the front door and rang the
bell.

207
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:05,990
He heard the sound of foot-steps in the hall
and the door opened and suddenly there stood

208
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:12,949
before him, or rather above him, a gigantic
woman dressed in riding-breeches.

209
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:17,129
Even through the smoke of her cigarette he
could smell the powerful odour of stables

210
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:20,060
and horse manure that clung about her.

211
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,060
'Yes?'

212
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,279
she asked, looking at him suspiciously.

213
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,949
'What is it you want?'

214
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:30,319
Mr Boggis, who half expected her to whinny
any moment, raised his hat, made a little

215
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,410
bow, and handed her his card.

216
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,930
'I do apologize for bothering you,' he said,
and then he waited, watching her face as she

217
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,019
read the message.

218
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,430
'I don't understand,' she said, handing back
the card.

219
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,089
'What is it you want?'

220
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:49,579
Mr Boggis explained about the Society for
the Preservation Rare Furniture.

221
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:53,389
'This wouldn't by any chance be something
to do with the Socialist Party?'

222
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:58,759
she asked, staring at him fiercely from under
a pair of pale bushy brows.

223
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,740
From then on, it was easy.

224
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:07,170
A Tory in riding-breeches, male or female,
was always a sitting duck for Mr Boggis.

225
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:12,970
He spent two minutes delivering an impassioned
eulogy on the extreme Right Wing of the Conservative

226
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,639
Party, then two more denouncing the Socialists.

227
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,990
As a clincher, he made particular reference
to the Bill that the Socialists had once introduced

228
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,509
for the abolition of blood - sports in the
country, and went on to inform his listener

229
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:31,369
that his idea of heaven - 'though you better
not tell the bishop, my dear' - was a place

230
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:37,009
where one could hunt the fox, the stag, and
the hare with large packs of tireless hounds

231
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:41,899
from morn till night every day of the week,
including Sundays.

232
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,329
Watching her as he spoke, he could see the
magic beginning to do its work.

233
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:51,939
The woman was grinning now, showing Mr Boggis
a set of enormous, slightly yellow teeth.

234
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:57,600
'Madam,' he cried, 'I beg of you, please don't
get me started on Socialism.'

235
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,759
At that point, she let out a great guffaw
of laughter, raised an enormous red hand,

236
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,429
and slapped him so hard on the shoulder that
he nearly went over.

237
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:08,429
'Come in!'

238
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:09,429
she shouted.

239
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:12,959
'I don't know what the hell you want, but
come on in!'

240
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,490
Unfortunately, and rather surprisingly, there
was nothing of any value in the whole house,

241
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,320
and Mr Boggis, who never wasted time on barren
territory, soon made his excuses and took

242
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,509
his leave.

243
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:31,079
The whole visit had taken less than fifteen
minutes, and that, he told himself as he climbed

244
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:39,740
back into his car and started off for the
next place, was exactly as it should be.

245
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,329
From now on, it was all farmhouses, and the
nearest was about half a mile up the road.

246
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:51,019
It was a large half-timbered brick building
of considerable age, and there was a magnificent

247
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:56,230
pear tree still in blossom covering almost
the whole of the south wall.

248
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,600
Mr Boggis knocked on the door.

249
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,779
He waited, but no one came.

250
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:06,699
He knocked again, but still there was no answer,
so he wandered around the back to look for

251
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:09,150
the farmer among the cowsheds.

252
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,209
There was no one there either.

253
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:16,820
He guessed that they must all still be in
church, so he began peering in the windows

254
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,510
to see if he could spot anything interesting.

255
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,920
There was nothing in the dining-room.

256
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,830
Nothing in the library either.

257
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:29,220
He tried the next window, the living-room,
and there, right under his nose, in the little

258
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:36,590
alcove that the window made, he saw a beautiful
thing, a semicircular card-table in mahogany,

259
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:42,770
richly veneered, and in the style of Hepplewhite,
built around 1780.

260
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,470
'Ah-ha,' he said aloud, pressing his face
hard against the glass.

261
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,390
'Well done, Boggis.'

262
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,370
But that was not all.

263
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,640
There was a chair there as well, a single
chair, and if he were not mistaken it was

264
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,760
of an even finer quality than the table.

265
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,340
Another Hepplewhite, wasn't it?

266
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,890
And oh, what a beauty!

267
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,840
The lattices on the back were finely carved
with the honeysuckle, the husk, and the paterae,

268
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,500
the caning on the seat was original, the legs
were very gracefully turned and the two back

269
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,500
ones had that peculiar outward splay that
meant so much.

270
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,870
It was an exquisite chair.

271
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:29,140
'Before this day is done,' Mr Boggis said
softly, 'I shall have the pleasure of sitting

272
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,830
down upon that lovely seat.'

273
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,890
He never bought a chair without doing this.

274
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:39,580
It was a favourite test of his, and it was
always an intriguing sight to see him lowering

275
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:46,090
himself delicately into the seat, waiting
for the 'give', expertly gauging the precise

276
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:52,410
but infinitesimal degree of shrinkage that
the years had caused in the mortice and dovetail

277
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,430
joints.

278
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,920
But there was no hurry, he told himself.

279
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,630
He would return here later.

280
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,860
He had the whole afternoon before him.

281
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:08,120
The next farm was situated some way back in
the fields, and in order to keep his car out

282
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,540
of sight, Mr Boggis had to leave it on the
road and walk about six hundred yards along

283
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:18,560
a straight track that led directly into the
back yard of the farmhouse.

284
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,760
This place, he noticed as he approached, was
a good deal smaller than the last, and he

285
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,050
didn't hold out much hope for it.

286
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:31,330
It looked rambling and dirty, and some of
the sheds were clearly in bad repair.

287
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,950
There were three men standing in a close group
in a corner of the yard, and one of them had

288
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,950
two large black greyhounds with him, on leashes.

289
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,790
When the men caught sight of Mr Boggis walking
forward in his black suit and parson's collar,

290
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:54,030
they stopped talking and seemed suddenly to
stiffen and freeze, becoming absolutely still,

291
00:19:54,030 --> 00:20:00,690
motionless, three faces turned towards him,
watching him suspiciously as he approached.

292
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:07,220
The oldest of the three was a stumpy man with
a wide frog-mouth and small shifty eyes, and

293
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,700
although Mr Boggis didn't know it, his name
was Rummins and he was the owner of the farm.

294
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,940
The tall youth beside him, who appeared to
have something wrong with one eye, was Bert,

295
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,550
the son of Rummins.

296
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:25,950
The shortish flat-faced man with a narrow
corrugated brow and immensely broad shoulders

297
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,950
was Claud.

298
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,350
Claud had dropped in on Rummins in the hope
of getting a piece of pork or ham out of him

299
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,540
from the pig that had been killed the day
before.

300
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,290
Claud knew about the killing - the noise of
it had carried far across the fields - and

301
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,830
he also knew that a man should have a government
permit to do that sort of thing, and that

302
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,520
Rummins didn't have one.

303
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,060
'Good afternoon,' Mr Boggis said.

304
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,330
'Isn't it a lovely day?'

305
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,810
None of the three men moved.

306
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:59,540
At that moment they were all thinking precisely
the same thing - that somehow or other this

307
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,370
clergyman, who was certainly not the local
fellow, had been sent to poke his nose into

308
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,980
their business and to report what he found
to the government.

309
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,790
'What beautiful dogs,' Mr Boggis said.

310
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:16,490
'I must say I've never been greyhound-racing
myself, but they tell me it's a fascinating

311
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,670
sport.'

312
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:24,801
Again the silence, and Mr Boggis glanced quickly
from Rummins to Bert, then to Claud, then

313
00:21:24,801 --> 00:21:29,820
back again to Rummins, and he noticed that
each of them had the same peculiar expression

314
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:36,000
on his face, something between a jeer and
a challenge, with a contemptuous curl to the

315
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,940
mouth and a sneer around the nose.

316
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,450
'Might I inquire if you are the owner?'

317
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,440
Mr Boggis asked, undaunted, addressing himself
to Rummins.

318
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,220
'What is it you want?'

319
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,690
'I do apologize for troubling you, especially
on a Sunday.'

320
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:57,440
Mr Boggis offered his card and Rummins took
it and held it up close to his face.

321
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:04,010
The other two didn't move, but their eyes
swivelled over to one side, trying to see.

322
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,370
'And what exactly might you be wanting?'

323
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,810
Rummins asked.

324
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:13,370
For the second time that morning, Mr Boggis
explained at some length the aims and ideals

325
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,200
of the Society for the Preservation of Rare
Furniture.

326
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,530
'We don't have any,' Rummins told him when
it was over.

327
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,890
'You're wasting your time.'

328
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,550
'Now, just a minute, sir,' Mr Boggis said,
raising a finger.

329
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:30,730
'The last man who said that to me was an old
farmer down in Sussex, and when he finally

330
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,340
let me into his house, do you know what I
found?

331
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,020
A dirty-looking old chair in the corner of
the kitchen, and it turned out to be worth

332
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,600
four hundred pounds!

333
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,840
I showed him how to sell it, and he bought
himself a new tractor with the money.'

334
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,760
'What on earth are you talking about?'

335
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
Claud said.

336
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,550
'There ain't no chair in the world worth four
hundred pound.'

337
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:56,050
'Excuse me,' Mr Boggis answered primly, 'but
there are plenty of chairs in England worth

338
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,090
more than twice that figure.

339
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,650
And you know where they are?

340
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:04,150
They're tucked away in the farms and cottages
all over the country, with the owners using

341
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:08,660
them as steps and ladders and standing on
them with hobnailed boots to reach a pot of

342
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,890
jam out of the top cupboard or to hang a picture.

343
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,810
This is the truth I'm telling you, my friends.'

344
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,940
Rummins shifted uneasily on his feet.

345
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,500
'You mean to say all you want to do is go
inside and stand there in the middle of the

346
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,360
room and look around?'

347
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,160
'Exactly,' Mr Boggis said.

348
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,350
He was at last beginning to sense what the
trouble might be.

349
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,580
'I don't want to pry into your cupboards or
into your larder.

350
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,980
I just want to look at the furniture to see
if you happen to have any treasures here,

351
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,660
and then I can write about them in our Society
magazine.'

352
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,260
'You know what I think?'

353
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,580
Rummins said, fixing him with his small wicked
eyes.

354
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,210
'I think you're after buying the stuff yourself.

355
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,560
Why else would you be going to all this trouble?'

356
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,040
'Oh, dear me.

357
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,230
I only wish I had the money.

358
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:03,290
Of course, if I saw something that I took
a great fancy to, and it wasn't beyond my

359
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,190
means, I might be tempted to make an offer.

360
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,110
But alas, that rarerely happens.'

361
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,520
'Well,' Rummins said, 'I don't suppose there's
any harm in your taking a look around if that's

362
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,870
all you want.'

363
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,390
He led the way across the yard to the back
door of the farmhouse, and Mr Boggis followed

364
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,950
him; so did the son Bert, and Claud with his
two dogs.

365
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,960
They went through the kitchen, where the only
furniture was a cheap deal table with a dead

366
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:38,900
chicken lying on it, and they emerged into
a fairly large, exceedingly filthy living-room.

367
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,520
And there it was!

368
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,940
Mr Boggis saw it at once, and he stopped dead
in his tracks and gave a little shrill gasp

369
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,510
of shock.

370
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:54,660
Then he stood there for five, ten, fifteen
seconds at least, staring like an idiot, unable

371
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,260
to believe, not daring to believe what he
saw before him.

372
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,980
It couldn't be true, not possibly!

373
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,680
But the longer he stared, the more true it
began to seem.

374
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:12,090
After all, there it was standing against the
wall right in front of him, as real and as

375
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,820
solid as the house itself.

376
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,450
And who in the world could possibly make a
mistake about a thing like that?

377
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,880
Admittedly it was painted white, but that
made not the slightest difference.

378
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,760
Some idiot had done that.

379
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,940
The paint could easily be stripped off.

380
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,740
But good God!

381
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,740
Just look at it!

382
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,380
And in a place like this!

383
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,650
At this point, Mr Boggis became aware of the
three men, Rummins, Bert, and Claud, standing

384
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:43,630
together in a group over by the fireplace,
watching him intently.

385
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:50,330
They had seen him stop and gasp and stare,
and they must have seen his face turning red,

386
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:55,120
or maybe it was white, but in any event they
had seen enough to spoil the whole goddamn

387
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,550
business if he didn't do something about it
quick.

388
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:03,940
In a flash, Mr Boggis clapped one hand over
his heart, staggered to the nearest chair,

389
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,140
and collapsed into it, breathing heavily.

390
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,510
'What's the matter with you?'

391
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,510
Claud asked.

392
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,470
'It's nothing,' he gasped.

393
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,130
'I'll be all right in a minute.

394
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,870
Please - a glass of water.

395
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,370
It's my heart.'

396
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:25,060
Bert fetched him the water, handed it to him,
and stayed close beside him, staring down

397
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,970
at him with a fatuous leer on his face.

398
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,590
'I thought maybe you were looking at something,'
Rummins said.

399
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:38,000
The wide frog-mouth widened a fraction further
into a crafty grin, showing the stubs of several

400
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,390
broken teeth.

401
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,760
'No, no,' Mr Boggis said.

402
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,930
'Oh dear me, no.

403
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:44,940
It's just my heart.

404
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,840
I'm so sorry.

405
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,660
It happens every now and then.

406
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,760
But it goes away quite quickly.

407
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,250
I'll be all right in a couple of minutes.'

408
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,200
He must have time to think, he told himself.

409
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,230
More important still, he must have time to
compose himself thoroughly before he said

410
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,950
another word.

411
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,520
Take it gently, Boggis.

412
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,320
And whatever you do, keep calm.

413
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,410
These people may be ignorant, but they are
not stupid.

414
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,530
They are suspicious and wary and sly.

415
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:20,660
And if it is really true - no it can't be,
it can't be true...

416
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:27,380
He was holding one hand up over his eyes in
a gesture of pain, and now, very carefully,

417
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,870
secretly, he made a little crack between two
of the fingers and peeked through.

418
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:38,470
Sure enough, the thing was still there, and
on this occasion he took a good long look

419
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,470
at it.

420
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,220
Yes - he had been right the first time!

421
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,930
There wasn't the slightest doubt about it!

422
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,720
It was really unbelievable!

423
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,780
What he saw was a piece of furniture that
any expert would have given almost anything

424
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,200
to acquire.

425
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:00,140
To a layman, it might not have appeared particularly
impressive, especially when covered over as

426
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:05,950
it was with dirty white paint, but to Mr Boggis
it was a dealer's dream.

427
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:11,700
He knew, as does every other dealer in Europe
and America, that among the most celebrated

428
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,670
and coveted examples of eighteenth- century
English furniture in existence are the three

429
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:21,880
famous pieces known as 'The Chippendale Commodes'.

430
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,630
He knew their history backwards - that the
first was 'discovered' in 1920, in a house

431
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:33,710
at Moreton-in-Marsh, and was sold at Sotheby's
the same year; that the other two turned up

432
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,690
in the same auction rooms a year later, both
coming out of Raynham Hall, Norfolk.

433
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,760
They all fetched enormous prices.

434
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,130
He couldn't quite remember the exact figure
for the first one, or even the second, but

435
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:51,900
he knew for certain that the last one to be
sold had fetched thirty- nine hundred guineas.

436
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,110
And that was in 1921!

437
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,040
Today the same piece would surely be worth
ten thousand pounds.

438
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:03,730
Some man, Mr Boggis couldn't remember his
name, had made a study of these commodes fairly

439
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:09,250
recently and had proved that all three must
have come from the same workshop, for the

440
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:14,060
veneers were all from the same log, and the
same set of templates had been used in the

441
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,870
construction of each.

442
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,770
No invoices had been found for any of them,
but all the experts were agreed that these

443
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:27,030
three commodes could have been executed only
by Thomas Chippendale himself, with his own

444
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,280
hands, at the most exalted period in his career.

445
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,340
And here, Mr Boggis kept telling himself as
he peered cautiously through the crack in

446
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,510
his fingers, here was the fourth Chippendale
Commode!

447
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,060
And he had found it!

448
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,310
He would be rich!

449
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,350
He would also be famous!

450
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,850
Each of the other three was known throughout
the furniture world by a special name - The

451
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:55,270
Chastleton Commode, The First Raynham Commode,
The Second Raynham Commode.

452
00:29:55,270 --> 00:30:00,600
This one would go down in history as The Boggis
Commode!

453
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,330
Just imagine the faces of the boys up there
in London when they got a look at it tomorrow

454
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,330
morning!

455
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:11,490
And the luscious offers coming in from the
big fellows over in the West End - Frank Partridge,

456
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,980
Mallet, Jetley, and the rest of them!

457
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,450
There would be a picture of it in The Times,
and it would say, 'The very fine Chippen dale

458
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:25,180
Commode which was recently discovered by Mr
Cyril Boggis, a London dealer....'

459
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,020
Dear God, what a stir he was going to make!

460
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:34,760
This one here, Mr Boggis thought, was almost
exactly similar to the Second Raynham Commode.

461
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,380
(All three, the Chastleton and the two Raynhams,
differed from one another in a number of small

462
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,380
ways.)

463
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:46,800
It was a most impressive handsome affair,
built in the French rococo style of Chippendale's

464
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:55,110
Directoire period, a kind of large fat chest-of-drawers
set upon four carved and fluted legs that

465
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,010
raised it about a foot from the ground.

466
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:03,370
There were six drawers in all, two long ones
in the middle and two shorter ones on either

467
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,370
side.

468
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:10,660
The serpentine front was magnificently ornamented
along the top and sides and bottom, and also

469
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:16,290
vertically between each set of drawers, with
intricate carvings of festoons and scrolls

470
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,920
and clusters.

471
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,680
The brass handles, although partly obscured
by white paint, appeared to be superb.

472
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,290
It was, of course, a rather 'heavy' piece,
but the design had been executed with such

473
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:37,070
elegance and grace that the heaviness was
in no way offensive.

474
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,760
'How're you feeling now?'

475
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,580
Mr Boggis heard someone saying.

476
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,440
'Thank you, thank you, I'm much better already.

477
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,990
It passes quickly.

478
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,850
My doctor says it's nothing to worry about
really so long as I rest for a few minutes

479
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,090
whenever it happens.

480
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:56,090
Ah yes,' he said, raising himself slowly to
his feet.

481
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,090
'That's better.

482
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,930
I'm all right now.'

483
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:04,590
A trifle unsteadily, he began to move around
the room examining the furniture, one piece

484
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,580
at a time, commenting upon it briefly.

485
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:12,070
He could see at once that apart from the commode
it was a very poor lot.

486
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,200
'Nice oak table,' he said.

487
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,390
'But I'm afraid it's not old enough to be
of any interest.

488
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:23,380
Good comfortable chairs, but quite modern,
yes, quite modern.

489
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:30,530
Now this cupboard, well, it's rather attractive,
but again, not valuable.

490
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:35,820
This chest-of-drawers' - he walked casually
past the Chippendale Commode and gave it a

491
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:41,880
little contemptuous flip with his fingers
- 'worth a few pounds, I dare say, but no

492
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
more.

493
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,020
A rather crude reproduction, I'm afraid.

494
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,860
Probably made in Victorian times.

495
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,790
Did you paint it white?'

496
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,150
'Yes,' Rummins said, 'Bert did it.'

497
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,010
'A very wise move.

498
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,680
It's considerably less offensive in white.'

499
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,700
'That's a strong piece of furniture,' Rummins
said.

500
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,120
'Some nice carving on it too.'

501
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,590
'Machine-carved,' Mr Boggis answered superbly,
bending down to examine the exquisite craftsmanship.

502
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,780
'You can tell it a mile off.

503
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,650
But still, I suppose it's quite pretty in
its way.

504
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,340
It has its points.'

505
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:18,490
He began to saunter off, then he checked himself
and turned slowly back again.

506
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:24,250
He placed the tip of one finger against the
point of his chin, laid his head over to one

507
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:28,030
side, and frowned as though deep in thought.

508
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:34,400
'You know what?' he said, looking at the commode,
speaking so casually that his voice kept trailing

509
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
off.

510
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,600
'I've just remembered...

511
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,740
I've been wanting a set of legs something
like that for a long time.

512
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,480
I've got a rather curious table in my own
little home, one of those low things that

513
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,950
people put in front of the sofa, sort of a
coffee-table, and last Michaelmas, when I

514
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,770
moved house, the foolish movers damaged the
legs in the most shocking way.

515
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,430
I'm very fond of that table.

516
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,720
I always keep my big Bible on it, and all
my sermon notes.'

517
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,700
He paused, stroking his chin with the finger.

518
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,780
'Now I was just thinking.

519
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,130
These legs on your chest-of-drawers might
be very suitable.

520
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,419
Yes, they might indeed.

521
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:20,889
They could easily be cut off and fixed on
to my table.'

522
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:27,569
He looked around and saw the three men standing
absolutely still, watching him suspiciously,

523
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:34,889
three pairs of eyes, all different but equally
mistrusting, small pig-eyes for Rummins, large

524
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:41,009
slow eyes for Claud, and two odd eyes for
Bert, one of them very queer and boiled and

525
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:46,789
misty pale, with a little black dot in the
center, like a fish eye on a plate.

526
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:49,450
Mr Boggis smiled and shook his head.

527
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,409
'Come, come, what on earth am I saying?

528
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:54,829
I'm talking as though I owned the piece myself.

529
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:55,929
I do apologize.'

530
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:00,250
'What you mean to say is you'd like to buy
it,' Rummins said.

531
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,250
'Well...'

532
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,769
Mr Boggis glanced back at the commode, frowning.

533
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:04,779
'I'm not sure.

534
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:11,230
I might... and then again ... on second thoughts
... no...

535
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,290
I think it might be a bit too much trouble.

536
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,690
It's not worth it.

537
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,760
I'd better leave it.'

538
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,990
'How much were you thinking of offering?'

539
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,990
Rummins asked.

540
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,029
'Not much, I'm afraid.

541
00:35:20,029 --> 00:35:22,880
You see, this is not a genuine antique.

542
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,720
It's merely a reproduction.'

543
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,619
I'm not so sure about that,' Rummins told
him.

544
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:31,660
'It's been in here over twenty years, and
before that it was up at the Manor House.

545
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,349
I bought it there myself at auction when the
old Squire died.

546
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:37,539
You can't tell me that thing's new.'

547
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:43,000
'It's not exactly new, but it's certainly
not more than about sixty years old.'

548
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,150
'It's more than that,' Rummins said.

549
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,849
'Bert, where's that bit of paper you once
found at the back of one of them drawers?

550
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:49,849
That old bill.'

551
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:53,329
The boy looked vacantly at his father.

552
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:58,130
Mr Boggis opened his mouth, then quickly shut
it again without uttering a sound.

553
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:03,320
He was beginning literally to shake with excitement,
and to calm himself he walked over to the

554
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,869
window and stared out at a plump brown hen
pecking around for stray grains of corn in

555
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:09,869
the yard.

556
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:14,259
'It was in the back of that drawer underneath
all them rabbit-snares,' Rummins was saying.

557
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:19,440
'Go on and fetch it out and show it to the
parson.'

558
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,539
When Bert went forward to the commode, Mr
Boggis turned round again.

559
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:25,950
He couldn't stand not watching him.

560
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,460
He saw him pull out one of the big middle
drawers, and he noticed the beautiful way

561
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,970
in which the drawer slid open.

562
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:39,170
He saw Bert's hand dipping inside and rummaging
around among a lot of wires and strings.

563
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,700
'You mean this?'

564
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,490
Bert lifted out a piece of folded yellowing
paper and carried it over to the father, who

565
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:48,440
unfolded it and held it up close to his face.

566
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,539
'You can't tell me this writing ain't bloody
old,' Rummins said, and he held the paper

567
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:57,859
out to Mr Boggis, whose whole arm was shaking
as he took it.

568
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:01,749
It was brittle and it cracked slightly between
his fingers.

569
00:37:01,749 --> 00:37:06,130
The writing was in a long sloping copperplate
hand:

570
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,490
Edward Montagu, Esq.

571
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,690
Dr
To Thos.

572
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,690
Chippendale

573
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:18,799
A large mahogany Commode Table of exceeding
fine wood, very rich carvd, set upon fluted

574
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:26,289
legs, two very neat shapd long drawers in
the middle part and two ditto on each side,

575
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:31,720
with rich chasd Brass Handles and Ornaments,
the whole completely finished in the most

576
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,150
exquisite taste 87 pounds.

577
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,930
Mr Boggis was holding on to himself tight
and fighting to suppress the excitement that

578
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,130
was spinning round inside him and making him
dizzy.

579
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,430
Oh God, it was wonderful!

580
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,579
With the invoice, the value had climbed even
higher.

581
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:51,839
What in heaven's name would it fetch now?

582
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,599
Twelve thousand pounds?

583
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,660
Fourteen?

584
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,569
Maybe fifteen or even twenty?

585
00:37:56,569 --> 00:37:58,490
Who knows?

586
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,410
Oh, boy!

587
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:06,881
He tossed the paper contemptuously on to the
table and said quietly, 'It's exactly what

588
00:38:06,881 --> 00:38:10,280
I told you, a Victorian reproduction.

589
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,900
This is simply the invoice that the seller
- the man who made it and passed it off as

590
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,519
an antique - gave to his client.

591
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,150
I've seen lots of them.

592
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,960
You'll notice that he doesn't say he made
it himself.

593
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,480
That would give the game away.'

594
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,900
'Say what you like,' Rummins announced, 'but
that's an old piece of paper.'

595
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,009
'Of course it is, my dear friend.

596
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:32,470
It's Victorian, late Victorian.

597
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,130
About eighteen ninety.

598
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,869
Sixty or seventy years old.

599
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:37,589
I've seen hundreds of them.

600
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:42,849
That was a time when masses of cabinet-makers
did nothing else but apply themselves to faking

601
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:45,019
the fine furniture of the century before.'

602
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:51,210
'Listen, Parson,' Rummins said, pointing at
him with a thick dirty finger, 'I'm not saying

603
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:56,440
as how you may not know a fair bit about this
furniture business, but what I am saying is

604
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,460
this: How on earth can you be so mighty sure
it's a fake when you haven't even seen what

605
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,960
it looks like underneath all that paint?'

606
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,410
'Come here,' Mr Boggis said.

607
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,720
'Come over here and I'll show you.'

608
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,069
He stood beside the commode and waited for
them to gather round.

609
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:15,930
'Now, anyone got a knife?'

610
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:20,930
Claud produced a horn-handled pocket knife,
and Mr Boggis took it and opened the smallest

611
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,930
blade.

612
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:27,470
Then, working with apparent casualness but
actually with extreme care, he began chipping

613
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,800
off the white paint from a small area on the
top of the commode.

614
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,869
The paint flaked away cleanly from the old
hard varnish underneath, and when he had cleared

615
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:42,960
away about three square inches, he stepped
back and said, 'Now, take a look at that!'

616
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,230
It was beautiful - a warm little patch of
mahogany, glowing like a topaz, rich and dark

617
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:53,210
with the true colour of its two hundred years.

618
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,950
'What's wrong with it?'

619
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,109
Rummins asked.

620
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:57,700
'It's processed!

621
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,980
Anyone can see that!'

622
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,940
'How can you see it, Mister?

623
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,940
You tell us.'

624
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,960
'Well, I must say that's a trifle difficult
to explain.

625
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,310
It's chiefly a matter of experience.

626
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:14,049
My experience tells me that without the slightest
doubt this wood has been processed with lime.

627
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:17,839
That's what they use for mahogany, to give
it that dark aged colour.

628
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,319
For oak, they use potash salts, and for walnut
it's nitric acid, but for mahogany it's always

629
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:25,319
lime.'

630
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:28,660
The three men moved a little closer to peer
at the wood.

631
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,489
There was a slight stirring of interest among
them now.

632
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:36,890
It was always intriguing to hear about some
new form of crookery or deception.

633
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,329
'Look closely at the grain.

634
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:42,569
You see that touch of orange in among the
dark red-brown.

635
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:43,569
That's the sign of lime.'

636
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:49,869
They leaned forward, their noses close to
the wood, first Rummins, then Claud, then

637
00:40:49,869 --> 00:40:50,869
Bert.

638
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:53,930
'And then there's the patina,' Mr Boggis continued.

639
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,329
'The what?'

640
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:59,329
He explained to them the meaning of this word
as applied to furniture.

641
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:04,999
'My dear friends, you've no idea the trouble
these rascals will go to to imitate the hard

642
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:08,609
beautiful bronze-like appearance of genuine
patina.

643
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:13,119
It's terrible, really terrible, and it makes
me quite sick to speak of it!'

644
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,230
He was spitting each word sharply off the
tip of the tongue and making a sour mouth

645
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,539
to show his extreme distaste.

646
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:23,609
The men waited, hoping for more secrets.

647
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:28,480
'The time and trouble that some mortals will
go to in order to deceive the innocent!'

648
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,640
Mr Boggis cried.

649
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,920
'It's perfectly disgusting!

650
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,329
D'you know what they did here, my friends?

651
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:34,670
I can recognize it clearly.

652
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:40,239
I can almost see them doing it, the long,
complicated ritual of rubbing the wood with

653
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:46,249
linseed oil, coating it over with french polish
that has been cunningly coloured, brushing

654
00:41:46,249 --> 00:41:52,720
it down with pumice- stone and oil, beeswaxing
it with a wax that contains dirt and dust,

655
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,329
and finally giving it the heat treatment to
crack the polish so that it looks like two-hundred-year-old

656
00:41:58,329 --> 00:41:59,329
varnish!

657
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:02,750
It really upsets me to contemplate such knavery!'

658
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,809
The three men continued to gaze at the little
patch of dark wood.

659
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:07,809
'Feel it!'

660
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:08,970
Mr Boggis ordered.

661
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,299
Put your fingers on it!

662
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:13,529
There, how does it feel, warm or cold?'

663
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:15,940
'Feels cold,' Rummins said.

664
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,760
'Exactly, my friend!

665
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,990
It happens to be a fact that faked patina
is always cold to the touch.

666
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,470
Real patina has a curiously warm feel to it.'

667
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,650
'This feels normal,' Rummins said, ready to
argue.

668
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,650
'No, sir, it's cold.

669
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,910
But of course it takes an experienced and
sensitive fingertip to pass a positive judgement.

670
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:41,759
You couldn't really be expected to judge this
any more than I could be expected to judge

671
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,750
the quality of your barley.

672
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:47,460
Everything in life, my dear sir, is experience.'

673
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:53,220
The men were staring at this queer moon-faced
clergyman with the bulging eyes, not quite

674
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:58,250
so suspiciously now because he did seem to
know a bit about his subject.

675
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:04,170
But they were still a long way from trusting
him.

676
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:09,450
Mr Boggis bent down and pointed to one of
the metal drawer-handles on the commode.

677
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,619
This is another place where the fakers go
to work,' he said.

678
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:15,920
'Old brass normally has a colour and character
all of its own.

679
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,279
Did you know that?'

680
00:43:17,279 --> 00:43:20,270
They stared at him, hoping for still more
secrets.

681
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,609
'But the trouble is that they've become exceedingly
skilled at matching it.

682
00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:29,710
In fact it's almost impossible to tell the
difference between "genuine old" and "faked

683
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,710
old".

684
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,789
I don't mind admitting that it has me guessing.

685
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:36,480
So there's not really any point in our scraping
the paint off these handles.

686
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,760
We wouldn't be any the wiser.'

687
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,809
'How can you possibly make new brass look
like old?'

688
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:42,809
Claud said.

689
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:44,160
'Brass doesn't rust, you know.'

690
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,420
'You are quite right, my friend.

691
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,249
But these scoundrels have their own secret
methods.'

692
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:50,569
'Such as what?'

693
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:51,569
Claud asked.

694
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:55,539
Any information of this nature was valuable,
in his opinion.

695
00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:57,499
One never knew when it might come in handy.

696
00:43:57,499 --> 00:44:02,819
'All they have to do,' Mr Boggis said, 'is
to place these handles overnight in a box

697
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:06,599
of mahogany shavings saturated in sal ammoniac.

698
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,789
The sal ammoniac turns the metal green, but
if you rub off the green, you will find underneath

699
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:18,119
it a fine soft silvery-warm lustre, a lustre
identical to that which comes with very old

700
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,119
brass.

701
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,009
Oh, it is so bestial, the things they do!

702
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:23,650
With iron they have another trick.'

703
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,690
'What do they do with iron?'

704
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,070
Claud asked, fascinated.

705
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,280
'Iron's easy,' Mr Boggis said.

706
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,140
'Iron locks and plates and hinges are simply
buried in common salt and they come out all

707
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,279
rusted and pitted in no time.'

708
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:37,890
'All right,' Rummins said.

709
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,420
'So you admit you can't tell about the handles.

710
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:44,289
For all you know, they may be hundreds and
hundreds of years old.

711
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:45,289
Correct?'

712
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:50,680
'Ah,' Mr Boggis whispered, fixing Rummins
with two big bulging brown eyes.

713
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,690
'That's where you're wrong.

714
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,200
Watch this.'

715
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,009
From his jacket pocket, he took out a small
screwdriver.

716
00:44:59,009 --> 00:45:04,170
At the same time, although none of them saw
him do it, he also took out a little brass

717
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:08,049
screw which he kept well hidden in the palm
of his hand.

718
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:12,640
Then he selected one of the screws in the
commode - there were four to each handle - and

719
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,089
began carefully scraping all traces of white
paint from its head.

720
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:20,509
When he had done this, he started slowly to
unscrew it.

721
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:26,480
'If this is a genuine old brass screw from
the eighteenth century,' he was saying, 'the

722
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,220
spiral will be slightly uneven and you'll
be able to see quite easily that it has been

723
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,619
hand-cut with a file.

724
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:39,420
But if this brass work is faked from more
recent times, Victorian or later, then obviously

725
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,579
the screw will be of the same period.

726
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:44,970
It will be a mass-produced, machine-made article.

727
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,260
Anyone can recognize a machine-made screw.

728
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,249
Well, we shall see.'

729
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:54,910
It was not difficult, as he put his hands
over the old screw and drew it out, for Mr

730
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:58,369
Boggis to substitute the new one hidden in
his palm.

731
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:03,410
This was another little trick of his, and
through the years it had proved a most rewarding

732
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,410
one.

733
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:09,170
The pockets of his clergyman's jacket were
always stocked with a quantity of cheap brass

734
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,349
screws of various sizes.

735
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:15,220
'There you are,' he said, handing the modern
screw to Rummins.

736
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,049
'Take a look at that.

737
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:19,299
Notice the exact evenness of the spiral?

738
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:20,369
See it?

739
00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:21,420
Of course you do.

740
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,950
It's just a cheap common little screw you
yourself could buy today in any ironmonger's

741
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,559
in the country.'

742
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:33,049
The screw was handed round from the one to
the other, each examining it carefully.

743
00:46:33,049 --> 00:46:37,450
Even Rummins was impressed now.

744
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:42,640
Mr Boggis put the screwdriver back in his
pocket together with the fine hand-cut screw

745
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,950
that he'd taken from the commode, and then
he turned and walked slowly past the three

746
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,739
men towards the door.

747
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:54,820
'My dear friends,' he said, pausing at the
entrance to the kitchen, 'it was so good of

748
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,670
you to let me peep inside your little home
- so kind.

749
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:00,999
I do hope I haven't been a terrible old bore.'

750
00:47:00,999 --> 00:47:04,000
Rummins glanced up from examining the screw.

751
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,859
'You didn't tell us what you were going to
offer,' he said.

752
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:08,499
'Ah,' Mr Boggis said.

753
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:10,450
'That's quite right.

754
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,450
I didn't, did I?

755
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:15,799
Well, to tell you the honest truth, I think
it's all a bit too much trouble.

756
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,160
I think I'll leave it.'

757
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,529
'How much would you give?'

758
00:47:19,529 --> 00:47:21,950
'You mean that you really wish to part with
it?'

759
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:24,400
'I didn't say I wished to part with it.

760
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,729
I asked you how much.'

761
00:47:26,729 --> 00:47:32,349
Mr Boggis looked across at the commode, and
he laid his head first to one side, then to

762
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:38,990
the other, and he frowned, and pushed out
his lips, and shrugged his shoulders, and

763
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:44,430
gave a little scornful wave of the hand as
though to say the thing was hardly worth thinking

764
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:45,900
about really, was it?

765
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,519
'Shall we say... ten pounds.

766
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:50,109
I think that would be fair.'

767
00:47:50,109 --> 00:47:51,460
'Ten pounds!'

768
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,570
Rummins cried.

769
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,819
'Don't be so ridiculous, Parson, please!'

770
00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:57,299
'It's worth more'n that for firewood!'

771
00:47:57,299 --> 00:47:58,930
Claud said, disgusted.

772
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,269
'Look here at the bill!'

773
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:05,619
Rummins went on, stabbing that precious document
so fiercely with his dirty fore-finger that

774
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:07,500
Mr Boggis became alarmed.

775
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,700
'It tells you exactly what it cost!

776
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,170
Eighty-seven pounds!

777
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,619
And that's when it was new.

778
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:14,770
Now it's antique it's worth double!'

779
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:18,069
'If you'll pardon me, no, sir, it's not.

780
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:20,359
It's a second-hand reproduction.

781
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:24,450
But I'll tell you what, my friend - I'm being
rather reckless, I can't help it - I'll go

782
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:27,089
up as high as fifteen pounds.

783
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:28,499
How's that?'

784
00:48:28,499 --> 00:48:30,930
'Make it fifty,' Rummins said.

785
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:37,579
A delicious little quiver like needles ran
all the way down the back of Mr Boggis's legs

786
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:39,880
and then under the soles of his feet.

787
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,150
He had it now.

788
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,410
It was his.

789
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,930
No question about that.

790
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:50,069
But the habit of buying cheap, as cheap as
it was humanly possible to buy, acquired by

791
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:56,349
years of necessity and practice, was too strong
in him now to permit him to give in so easily.

792
00:48:56,349 --> 00:49:02,559
'My dear man,' he whispered softly, 'I only
want the legs.

793
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,249
Possibly I could find some use for the drawers
later on, but the rest of it, the carcass

794
00:49:07,249 --> 00:49:12,980
itself, as your friend so rightly said, it's
firewood, that's all.'

795
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,819
'Make it thirty-five,' Rummins said.

796
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:19,019
'I couldn't sir, I couldn't!

797
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:20,049
It's not worth it.

798
00:49:20,049 --> 00:49:23,839
And I simply mustn't allow myself to haggle
like this about a price.

799
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:24,920
It's all wrong.

800
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,710
I'll make you one final offer, and then I
must go.

801
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:29,759
Twenty pounds.'

802
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:31,749
'I'll take it,' Rummins snapped.

803
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:32,749
'It's yours.'

804
00:49:32,749 --> 00:49:35,410
'Oh dear,' Mr Boggis said, clasping his hands.

805
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,489
'There I go again.

806
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:39,339
I should never have started this in the first
place.'

807
00:49:39,339 --> 00:49:41,099
'You can't back out now, Parson.

808
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:42,540
A deal's a deal.'

809
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,980
'Yes, yes, I know.'

810
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,849
'How're you going to take it?'

811
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,759
'Well, let me see.

812
00:49:47,759 --> 00:49:52,200
Perhaps if I were to drive my car up into
the yard, you gentlemen would be kind enough

813
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,420
to help me load it?'

814
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,690
'In a car?

815
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,609
This thing'll never go in a car!

816
00:49:56,609 --> 00:49:57,769
You'll need a truck for this!'

817
00:49:57,769 --> 00:49:59,509
'I don't think so.

818
00:49:59,509 --> 00:50:00,779
Anyway, we'll see.

819
00:50:00,779 --> 00:50:02,109
My car's on the road.

820
00:50:02,109 --> 00:50:03,369
I'll be back in a jiffy.

821
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:05,539
We'll manage it somehow, I'm sure.'

822
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:10,779
Mr Boggis walked out into the yard and through
the gate and then down the long track that

823
00:50:10,779 --> 00:50:13,509
led across the field towards the road.

824
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:18,589
He found himself giggling quite uncontrollably,
and there was a feeling inside him as though

825
00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:24,099
hundreds and hundreds of tiny bubbles were
rising up from his stomach and bursting merrily

826
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:27,309
in the top of his head, like sparkling-water.

827
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:32,040
All the buttercups in the field were suddenly
turning into golden sovereigns, glistening

828
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,430
in the sunlight.

829
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:37,750
The ground was littered with them, and he
swung off the track on to the grass so that

830
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:42,220
he could walk among them and tread on them
and hear the little metallic tinkle they made

831
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,710
as he kicked them around with his toes.

832
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:48,420
He was finding it difficult to stop himself
from breaking into a run.

833
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,910
But clergymen never run; they walk slowly.

834
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,390
Walk slowly, Boggis.

835
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:54,450
Keep calm, Boggis.

836
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,270
There's no hurry now.

837
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,070
The commode is yours!

838
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:02,410
Yours for twenty pounds, and it's worth fifteen
or twenty thousand!

839
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:03,829
The Boggis Commode!

840
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:09,140
In ten minutes it'll be loaded into your car
- it'll go in easily - and you'll be driving

841
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,190
back to London and singing all the way!

842
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:16,559
Mr Boggis driving the Boggis Commode home
in the Boggis car.

843
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,019
Historic occasion.

844
00:51:18,019 --> 00:51:21,249
What wouldn't a newspaperman give to get a
picture of that!

845
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:22,609
Should he arrange it?

846
00:51:22,609 --> 00:51:24,019
Perhaps he should.

847
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:25,420
Wait and see.

848
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,869
Oh, glorious day!

849
00:51:26,869 --> 00:51:30,099
Oh, lovely, sunny summer day!

850
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:34,099
Oh, glory be!

851
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:39,440
Back in the farmhouse, Rummins was saying,
'Fancy that old bastard giving twenty pound

852
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,609
for a load of junk like this.'

853
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:44,509
'You did very nicely, Mr Rummins,' Claud told
him.

854
00:51:44,509 --> 00:51:45,599
'You think he'll pay you?'

855
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,180
'We don't put it in the car till he do.'

856
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,900
'And what if it won't go in the car?'

857
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,900
Claud asked.

858
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,569
'You know what I think, Mr Rummins?

859
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:54,190
You want my honest opinion?

860
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,910
I think the bloody thing's too big to go in
the car.

861
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,089
And then what happens?

862
00:51:58,089 --> 00:52:01,369
Then he's going to say to hell with it and
just drive off without it and you'll never

863
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:02,380
see him again.

864
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,849
Nor the money either.

865
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:06,619
He didn't seem all that keen on having it,
you know.'

866
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:10,479
Rummins paused to consider this new and rather
alarming prospect.

867
00:52:10,479 --> 00:52:13,970
'How can a thing like that possibly go in
a car?'

868
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:14,970
Claud went on relentlessly.

869
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,640
'A parson never has a big car anyway.

870
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,319
You ever seen a parson with a big car, Mr
Rummins?'

871
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,729
'Can't say I have.'

872
00:52:21,729 --> 00:52:22,729
'Exactly!

873
00:52:22,729 --> 00:52:24,259
And now listen to me.

874
00:52:24,259 --> 00:52:25,400
I've got an idea.

875
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,890
He told us, didn't he, that it was only the
legs he was wanting.

876
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:29,890
Right?

877
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:34,950
So all we've got to do is to cut 'em off quick
right here on the spot before he comes back,

878
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:37,029
then it'll be sure to go in the car.

879
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:40,930
All we're doing is saving him the trouble
of cutting them off himself when he gets home.

880
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,869
How about it, Mr Rummins?'

881
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:46,819
Claud's flat bovine face glimmered with a
mawkish pride.

882
00:52:46,819 --> 00:52:50,330
'It's not such a bad idea at that,' Rummins
said, looking at the commode.

883
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:52,920
'In fact it's a bloody good idea.

884
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,529
Come on then, we'll have to hurry.

885
00:52:54,529 --> 00:52:56,599
You and Bert carry it out into the yard.

886
00:52:56,599 --> 00:52:57,749
I'll get the saw.

887
00:52:57,749 --> 00:52:59,650
Take the drawers out first.'

888
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:04,349
Within a couple of minutes, Claud and Bert
had carried the commode outside and had laid

889
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:09,910
it upside down in the yard amidst the chicken
droppings and cow dung and mud.

890
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:15,030
In the distance, half-way across the field,
they could see a small black figure striding

891
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,980
along the path towards the road.

892
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,490
They paused to watch.

893
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:24,640
There was something rather comical about the
way in which this figure was conducting itself.

894
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,900
Every now and again it would break into a
trot, then it did a kind of hop, skip, and

895
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:35,050
jump, and once it seemed as though the sound
of a cheerful song came rippling faintly to

896
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:37,170
them from across the meadow.

897
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:43,400
'I reckon he's balmy,' Claud said, and Bert
grinned darkly, rolling his misty eye slowly

898
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,450
round in its socket.

899
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:51,630
Rummins came waddling over from the shed,
squat and froglike, carrying a long saw.

900
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,210
Claud took the saw away from him and went
to work.

901
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,420
'Cut 'em close,' Rummins said.

902
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,670
'Don't forget he's going to use 'em on another
table.'

903
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:05,099
The mahogany was hard and very dry, and as
Claud worked, a fine red dust sprayed out

904
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:08,890
from the edge of the saw and fell softly to
the ground.

905
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:14,849
One by one, the legs came off, and when they
were all severed, Bert stooped down and arranged

906
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:17,400
them carefully in a row.

907
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,339
Claud stepped back to survey the results of
his labour.

908
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:23,470
There was a longish pause.

909
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:28,029
'Just let me ask you one question, Mr Rummins,'
he said slowly.

910
00:54:28,029 --> 00:54:33,200
'Even now, could you put that enormous thing
into the back of a car?'

911
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,269
'Not unless it was a van.'

912
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:36,269
'Correct!'

913
00:54:36,269 --> 00:54:37,269
Claud cried.

914
00:54:37,269 --> 00:54:39,010
'And parsons don't have vans, you know.

915
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:42,700
All they've got usually is piddling little
Morris Eights or Austin Sevens.'

916
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,480
'The legs is all he wants,' Rummins said.

917
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,940
'If the rest of it won't go in, then he can
leave it.

918
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,009
He can't complain.

919
00:54:49,009 --> 00:54:50,349
He's got the legs.'

920
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:53,749
'Now you know better'n that, Mr Rummins,'
Claud said patiently.

921
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:57,700
'You know damn well he's going to start knocking
the price if he don't get every single bit

922
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,249
of this into the car.

923
00:54:59,249 --> 00:55:02,859
A parson's just as cunning as the rest of
'em when it comes to money, don't you make

924
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:04,510
any mistake about that.

925
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,160
Especially this old boy.

926
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,089
So why don't we give him his firewood now
and be done with it.

927
00:55:09,089 --> 00:55:10,739
Where d'you keep the axe?'

928
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:13,349
'I reckon that's fair enough,' Rummins said.

929
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:15,420
'Bert, go fetch the axe.'

930
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:21,589
Bert went into the shed and fetched a tall
woodcutter's axe and gave it to Claud.

931
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:24,839
Claud spat on the palms of his hands and rubbed
them together.

932
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:30,920
Then, with a long-armed high-swinging action,
he began fiercely attacking the legless carcass

933
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,369
of the commode.

934
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:37,579
It was hard work, and it took several minutes
before he had the whole thing more or less

935
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:39,539
smashed to pieces.

936
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:44,150
'I'll tell you one thing,' he said, straightening
up, wiping his brow: 'That was a bloody good

937
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:47,979
carpenter put this job together and I don't
care what the parson says.'

938
00:55:47,979 --> 00:55:49,390
'We're just in time!'

939
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:50,540
Rummins called out.

940
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:51,540
'Here he comes!'

941
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:51,542
- THE END -
