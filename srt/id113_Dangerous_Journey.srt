1
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,410
There was forest all round.

2
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,520
All round for hundreds of kilometres.

3
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,980
And there were no roads in the forest.

4
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,410
There were only tracks.

5
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,070
Two tents stood in a clearing.

6
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,110
Two men were standing near the tents.

7
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,760
The younger man, Manuel, was making coffee
on a small stove.

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,159
He looked up at the sky.

9
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:54,239
'It's going to rain today,' he said.

10
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,670
'I know,' replied Leon.

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,230
'And the rain will turn the ground into mud.

12
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,379
Then we'll never get back to base.'

13
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:04,989
Four men were working in the forest.

14
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,380
They were looking for iron and other metals.

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:15,040
Leon was the boss and he was angry.

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,200
It was early morning.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,090
Leon and Manuel were ready to leave.

18
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,350
But Joe and Pedro were our in the forest.

19
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,060
'They left in the truck two days ago,' said
Leon.

20
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,690
They're very late.'

21
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,189
Joe was always making trouble.

22
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:34,130
He was younger than Leon and he was clever.

23
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,880
He wanted to be boss.

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,359
Manuel poured the coffee into mugs and the
two men drank it slowly.

25
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:45,350
Suddenly they heard the sound of a truck.

26
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,720
'They're back,' said Manuel.

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,399
The truck came up the rough track.

28
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,329
It stopped near the tents.

29
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:56,640
Joe jumped out.

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,320
He was a big man with red hair.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,159
He was smiling.

32
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,880
His smile made Leon more angry.

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,539
'You're late,' said Leon.

34
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:08,479
'Where have you been?'

35
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,890
'Hunting,' replied Joe.

36
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,850
And he held up his rifle.

37
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,790
'Hunting,' Leon shouted angrily.

38
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,750
'That's not your job.

39
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,030
We haven't time for hunting.'

40
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,190
'We were away for two days,' replied Joe.

41
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,349
'We're not very late.'

42
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:27,300
'I'm the boss here!'

43
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,320
Leon shouted.

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,780
Joe looked at Leon angrily.

45
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,220
He was not smiling now.

46
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,290
'We're late - very late,' said Leon.

47
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,360
'The rain will start soon and then there will
be mud everywhere.

48
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,110
We must leave now.

49
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:50,320
Manuel took down the tents and Joe and Pedro
put the boxes into the truck.

50
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,150
'Hurry!'

51
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,580
shouted Leon.

52
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,900
'It's ten o'clock.

53
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,970
Let's go.'

54
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,670
Soon everything was in the truck.

55
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,000
Joe sat in the driver's seat.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,110
Leon sat beside him.

57
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,580
Manuel and Pedro climbed into the back of
the truck.

58
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,590
Joe started the engine and the journey began.

59
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,160
They drove easily for the first twenty kilometres.

60
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,920
Then they came to a stream.

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,980
'There was no water here last week!'

62
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,750
Pedro shouted to Manuel.

63
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,000
'Look at the water now.'

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,810
The stream was full of water.

65
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,260
Joe slowed down and drove the truck carefully
through the rushing water.

66
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,240
They crossed the stream and Joe drove faster.

67
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,800
The rain was now falling heavily.

68
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,750
The track was very muddy and the truck began
to slide.

69
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,370
'Watch out!'

70
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,960
shouted Leon.

71
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,450
But it was too late.

72
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,050
The truck stopped.

73
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,640
The wheels were still turning, but the truck
was not moving.

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,790
The wheels were turning round and round in
the mud.

75
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,940
Leon got out and Pedro and Manuel jumped down.

76
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,850
Joe sat in the driver's seat.

77
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,230
Leon looked at the wheels in the mud.

78
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,389
Then he looked up at Joe.

79
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,320
'It's your fault,' he said angrily.

80
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,550
'You were driving too fast.'

81
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:29,740
'Pedro, you cut branches from those trees,'
ordered Leon, 'And you, Manuel, throw the

82
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,460
branches under the wheels.'

83
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,030
Pedro got a large knife out of the truck and
Manuel helped him.

84
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,640
Leon turned to Joe.

85
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,820
'You, come and help us.

86
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,720
Joe did not move.

87
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,130
'I'm driving the truck,' he said.

88
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,070
'That's my job.'

89
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,580
'I'm boss here!'

90
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,580
shouted Leon.

91
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,250
'Come and help us.'

92
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,430
Joe did not say anything.

93
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,870
He did not get out of the truck.

94
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,130
Leon looked at him angrily.

95
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,200
Then Leon walked away.

96
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,500
Manuel and Pedro threw branches under the
wheels.

97
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,710
'OK.

98
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,240
That's enough,' said Leon.

99
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,980
'Let's go.'

100
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,070
Joe started the engine again.

101
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,960
Pedro and Manuel pushed the back of the truck.

102
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,900
The wheels turned and the engine roared.

103
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,540
But the truck did not move.

104
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,090
'Push harder,' shouted Leon.

105
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,010
Suddenly, the truck moved forward.

106
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,580
It was out of the mud.

107
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,910
Pedro and Manuel shouted happily.

108
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,790
At that moment, a large branch flew up from
under a wheel.

109
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,500
It hit Leon's arm.

110
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,520
He stepped back and fell in the mud.

111
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,410
'Stop the truck!'

112
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:51,250
shouted Manuel.

113
00:05:51,250 --> 00:06:04,090
'Leon's hurt.'

114
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:19,060
At midday, it was still raining heavily.

115
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,500
The track was covered with mud.

116
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,710
Joe drove slowly and the truck did not stop
again.

117
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,120
They climbed up a steep hill.

118
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,460
On the other side, the track went down to
a river.

119
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,590
It was the biggest river in the forest.

120
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,000
This was the last river between the men and
their base.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,370
An old wooden bridge crossed over the river.

122
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,960
They drove down towards the bridge.

123
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,310
'Look!'

124
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,730
Leon shouted to Joe.

125
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,060
'Something's wrong.

126
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,480
It's the bridge.

127
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,520
It's broken.'

128
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,560
Joe did not stop the truck.

129
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,680
He drove down slowly to the bank of the river.

130
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,610
He drove to the edge of the broken bridge.

131
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,640
Then he stopped.

132
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,150
They all got out of the truck.

133
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,010
They stood in silence.

134
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,240
Nobody spoke.

135
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,360
They looked at the broken bridge and at the
rushing water.

136
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,250
Pedro spoke first.

137
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,790
'There is no way across the river now.

138
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,740
How can we get back to base?'

139
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,020
'We must get help,' said Leon.

140
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,810
'Pedro, you climb back up the hill.

141
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,460
Take the radio with you and call base.

142
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,560
Perhaps they'll hear you and send help.'

143
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,500
Manuel lifted the radio out of the truck and
fixed it to Pedro's back.

144
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,050
Joe stopped them.

145
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,270
'It won't work,' he said.

146
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,660
'Why not?' asked Leon.

147
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,990
'It isn't a strong radio,' replied Joe.

148
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,560
'We're too far away from the base.

149
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,790
No one will hear us from this side of the
river.

150
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,930
We must cross the river by ourselves.'

151
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,699
'We can't,' said Leon.

152
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,110
'We must get help.'

153
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,370
'We can't get help from here,' said Joe.

154
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,610
'We must cross the river first.

155
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,460
Then we can get help.'

156
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,949
'But how do we get across?' asked Leon.

157
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,949
'It's too dangerous.

158
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:14,300
Look at the water.

159
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,220
The rain was still falling heavily and the
water was rising.

160
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,400
'I have a plan,' said Joe.

161
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,509
Leon looked at Joe and smiled.

162
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,229
'You're clever, Joe,' Leon said.

163
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:31,560
'You always have plans.

164
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,720
But they never work!'

165
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,240
'Let's listen to Joe's plan,' said Manuel.

166
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,510
'We can use the boat,' said Joe.

167
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,510
Leon laughed.

168
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,110
'Don't be stupid.

169
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,100
The boat's too small for four people.

170
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,449
And look at the rushing water.

171
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:49,560
It will carry the boat away.'

172
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,190
'But we've got a rope,' said Joe.

173
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,440
'We can tie the rope to the boat.

174
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,390
With luck, the water will carry the boat to
the other side.'

175
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,779
'We can try it,' said Pedro.

176
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:04,210
'It won't work,' said Leon.

177
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,810
'It will work,' said Joe.

178
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:41,920
'Look, I'll show you.'

179
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,760
'It won't work,' Leon said.

180
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,960
'But we can try it.'

181
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,120
'I'll go first,' Joe said, 'it's my plan.'

182
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,590
'No, let me go,' said Pedro.

183
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,720
'I am stronger.'

184
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,440
'You can both go,' said Leon.

185
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,070
'Pedro, you stay on the other side.

186
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,420
Joe, you bring the boat back and then you
can take Manuel.

187
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,839
Then you can come back again for me.'

188
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,130
'Good,' Joe said.

189
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,570
'Pedro, you bring the radio.

190
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,820
You can use it on the other side of the river.

191
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,440
Pedro got the rubber boat out of the truck
and pumped it up.

192
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,170
Leon helped him with his right arm.

193
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,930
There was a long rope in the back of the truck.

194
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,890
Joe tied it to the broken bridge.

195
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,560
Manuel tied the other end of the rope to the
rubber boat.

196
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,990
'It's a long rope,' Leon said.

197
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,990
'It'll be all right.'

198
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,770
'Hurry,' said Joe.

199
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:45,920
'The water is rising quickly.'

200
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,580
Joe and Pedro carried the boat.

201
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,800
Manuel and Leon walked behind them.

202
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,750
Manuel held the boat.

203
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,810
Joe and Pedro climbed in.

204
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:03,120
The rushing water took the boat into the middle
of the river.

205
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,430
The boat crossed to the other side.

206
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,410
It came near the bridge.

207
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,180
The Joe held on.

208
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,640
Pedro climbed out of the boat.

209
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,450
Pedro tied the rope to a piece of the bridge.

210
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,800
Pedro stayed on the far side of the river.

211
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,980
Joe pulled hard on the rope and the boat slowly
came back to Leon and Manuel.

212
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,700
'You get in now, Manuel,' said Leon.

213
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,180
'I'm going last.'

214
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,980
'No, you're not,' Manuel replied.

215
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,980
'Your arm is broken.

216
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,690
You can't get into the boat alone.

217
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,649
You need help.

218
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:43,770
I'll help you.

219
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,050
'Manuel is right,' said Joe.

220
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,750
'You need help, Leon.'

221
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,610
Manuel helped Leon into the boat.

222
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,140
He sat down in the boat and Joe pulled hard
on the rope.

223
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,130
Trouble came suddenly.

224
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,980
Joe and Leon were in the middle of the river.

225
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,750
Leon saw the tree first.

226
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,050
The rushing water was pulling it down the
river.

227
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,730
'Look out!'

228
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,500
Leon shouted.

229
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,149
Joe looked round.

230
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,110
At that moment, the branches of the tree hit
the boat.

231
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,050
Joe held onto the rope.

232
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,040
His feet slipped and the boat moved away from
him.

233
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,560
'Hold onto the rope!'

234
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Leon shouted.

235
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,200
But Joe did not listen.

236
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:34,430
He let go of the rope and swam towards the
rubber boat.

237
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,130
Joe was a good swimmer and he soon reached
the boat.

238
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,790
He held it tightly and kicked his legs hard
in the water.

239
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,390
The boat moved away from the tree.

240
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,060
'Good,' Joe shouted to Leon.

241
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,570
'The boat's free.

242
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,600
'Leave the boat!'

243
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,700
shouted Leon.

244
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,149
'Save yourself.'

245
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,890
Joe did not listen.

246
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,459
He held the boat and kicked his legs.

247
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:03,740
A few moments later, Joe heard a loud noise.

248
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,860
'What's that?' he asked Leon.

249
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,370
'It's a waterfall,' replied Leon.

250
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,230
'The water will pull the boat over.

251
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,399
Leave the boat.

252
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,399
Save yourself.'

253
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,240
'Look!'

254
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
shouted Joe.

255
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,740
'There's a rock!

256
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,080
In front of us.

257
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
We must reach it.'

258
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,570
'Don't be a fool,' said Leon.

259
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,880
'Save yourself.

260
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,450
You can't save me.

261
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,810
The water rushed round the boat.

262
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,620
It was pulling them towards the waterfall.

263
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,730
Joe kicked his legs harder.

264
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,150
The boat moved quickly towards the rock.

265
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,190
'Get ready,' shouted Joe.

266
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,370
'Jump for the rock!'

267
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,800
Leon was ready.

268
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,350
The boat came near the rock and Leon jumped.

269
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,290
Joe let go of the boat and swam to the rock.

270
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,870
The two men lay on the rock.

271
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,740
For a few minutes they did not say anything.

272
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,520
Then Leon turned and smiled at Joe.

273
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,380
Joe had saved his life.

274
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,160
'We're not safe yet,' Joe shouted.

275
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,660
The rain has stopped but the water is still
rising.

276
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,590
It'll cover the rock in an hour or two.

277
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,020
Joe was right.

278
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,270
There was water all round the two men.

279
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,880
In front of them, the water dropped over the
waterfall.

280
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,060
Behind them, there was the broken bridge.

281
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,450
'We must get help,' said Leon.

282
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,780
'But how?'

283
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,500
'Pedro,' replied Joe.

284
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,650
'He can help us.

285
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:44,930
He's got the radio.'

286
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,080
Pedro was waiting on the far side of the river.

287
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,529
He watched Joe and Leon.

288
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,730
They climbed onto the rock.

289
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,040
They were safe.

290
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,880
They won't be safe for long, thought Pedro.

291
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,500
I must call base and get help.

292
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,240
Pedro climbed up the hill behind him.

293
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,400
He walked quickly for half an hour.

294
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,920
At the top of the hill, he climbed onto a
high rock.

295
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,260
He took the radio off his back and pulled
our the aerial.

296
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,140
Pedro spoke into the radio.

297
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,070
'PX75 calling base.

298
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,550
PX75 calling base.'

299
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,870
He waited and listened.

300
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,590
'PX75 calling base.

301
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,640
PX75 calling base.'

302
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,140
There was no reply.

303
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,589
'PX75 calling base.

304
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:43,529
PX75 calling base.'

305
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:46,050
Philip was sitting at the control desk.

306
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,950
He was listening to the radio.

307
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,550
PX75 was Leon's number.

308
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,140
Philip turned the dials of the radio.

309
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,910
The voice became clearer.

310
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,339
'Hello, PX75,' said Philip.

311
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:01,420
This is base.

312
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,730
What's your message?

313
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,730
Over.'

314
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,639
'Hello, base.

315
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,579
PX75 here.

316
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:09,529
Pedro speaking.

317
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:10,899
Can you hear me?'

318
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:13,060
'Loud and clear, Pedro.

319
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,279
What's your message?

320
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,279
Over.'

321
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,220
'We're in trouble,' said Pedro.

322
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,510
'The bridge over the River Sandano is broken.

323
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,300
Joe and Leon are on a rock in the middle of
the river.

324
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,610
They are above the waterfall.

325
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,730
Can you send help?

326
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,730
Over.'

327
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,850
'River Sandano.

328
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,270
Near bridge.

329
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,510
Above waterfall.

330
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,730
OK Pedro.

331
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,070
Help is coming.

332
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,190
Over.

333
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,000
Pedro climbed down the hill to the broken
bridge.

334
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,250
Manuel was waiting on the other side of the
river.

335
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,530
Pedro shouted and Manuel waved.

336
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,390
Both men looked down the river.

337
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:00,350
The water was rising fast and the rock looked
very small now.

338
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,750
On the rock, Joe was holding Leon in his arms.

339
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,850
Leon's arm was covered in blood.

340
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,899
His eyes were closed and he did not move.

341
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:13,750
Then Joe heard the noise.

342
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,750
A helicopter.

343
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,870
It was high above the broken bridge.

344
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,010
'A helicopter!'

345
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,010
Joe shouted.

346
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,010
'Leon, look!'

347
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:26,510
But Leon's eyes were closed and he said nothing.

348
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,569
The helicopter was soon over the rock.

349
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:32,470
A rope was lowered and Joe held it.

350
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,070
Then he tied it round Leon.

351
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,540
Joe held Leon with one hand and he held the
rope with the other.

352
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:51,680
Slowly, the two men were lifted in the air.

353
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,590
Leon woke up slowly.

354
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,260
He was still half-asleep.

355
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,210
'Where am I?' he asked.

356
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,730
Then he remembered the rock.

357
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,720
And the helicopter.

358
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,080
And Joe.

359
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,610
'Joe!' he shouted out.

360
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,070
'Where's Joe?'

361
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,470
'Don't worry,' said a voice.

362
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,340
'I'm not dead yet!'

363
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,010
Leon opened his eyes fully and saw Joe.

364
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,850
Joe was smiling.

365
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,070
Pedro and Manuel were standing next to him.

366
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,450
The four men were in a hut at base.

367
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,130
Leon was lying in bed and his arm was in plaster.

368
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,820
'You'll feel better in a few days, Leon,'
said Joe.

369
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,650
'I feel better now!' said Leon.

370
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,050
'But I need a drink.'

371
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,470
'Water?' asked Manuel.

372
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,020
'No, not water,' replied Leon.

373
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,900
'I don't want to see water again - not for
a long time!'

374
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,380
And they all laughed.

375
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:53,860
- THE END -
