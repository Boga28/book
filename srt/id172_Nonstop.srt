1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,750
Chapter one

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,750
Nonstop

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,750
Henry Stankey hated flying.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,920
Actually, "hate" was perhaps the wrong word.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,720
Hatred implied anger, active resistance; hatred
was a type of control.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,279
Airplane flight filled Stankey with the kind
of helpless despair he sometimes imagined

7
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:28,570
must have poisoned the air of Belsen and Treblinka;
he only felt anger when he looked around the

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:34,870
boarding area at his complacent fellow passengers,
slumped in identical airport chairs like an

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:42,690
exhibition of soft sculptures, their faces
bored, uncaring, flattened into shadowlessness

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,399
by the fluorescent lights.

11
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:51,820
As he stared, he could feel moisture again
between his hand and the chair's plastic arm.

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,550
He ground his palm on the knees of his corduroys
and was miserable.

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,239
Why hadn't Diana come?

14
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:07,490
Stankey hated himself for needing his wife
this way - not for herself, but as a handholder,

15
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,460
a nursemaid.

16
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,810
When she had told him that her boss was out
sick with strep throat, that they couldn't

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,890
do without her at the office and that he would
have to go to Dallas by himself, he had wanted

18
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,420
to reach out and shake her.

19
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,580
She knew he couldn't cancel out this late;
he'd already paid good money to ship his artwork

20
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,409
to the hotel.

21
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:34,450
He'd also used his scant funds to pay convention
fees.

22
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,070
He had to go.

23
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:43,270
Diana knew how much he hated flying, dreaded
it, yet she had chosen to stay and help out

24
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,130
her boss Muriel rather than him.

25
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,590
The night she told him, he had not slept well.

26
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:58,520
He had dreamed of cattle herded up a ramp-eye-rolling,
idiot cattle bumping against each other as

27
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,490
they were prodded into a dark boxcar.

28
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,880
The Thursday afternoon flight out of San Francisco
was terrible.

29
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,220
He almost took a couple of the Valium hidden
deep in his pocket in a twist of Saran Wrap.

30
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,760
Only the compelling thought that the plane
might catch fire on the runway, that the panicking

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,780
crew and passengers might leave him behind
in drugged sleep, prevented him from taking

32
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,280
the tranquilizers.

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,780
Instead, as he always did, he clutched the
lucky talisman hidden beneath his shirt-he

34
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,900
was ashamed of it, really: a hide bolo tie
Diana had brought back from New Mexico, where

35
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:49,330
her aged parents lived in a trailer camp-clutched
it and willed the aircraft down the run-way.

36
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,870
Sweaty hand clasped on chest, he forced the
plane up off the tarmac through sheer force

37
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:02,959
of mind, dragging it aloft as the other passengers
stared unconcernedly out the small windows,

38
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:10,260
or read gaudy paperbacks, or slept (slept!).

39
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,690
Once the jet was in the air, he began his
terrified drill: smoothing the turbulence,

40
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,720
wishing away dangerous crosswinds, tensing
his legs so as to put the minimum amount of

41
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:30,849
weight down on the cabin floor and avoid the
laboring vibrations of the plane's underpowered,

42
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,940
overtaxed engines.

43
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:39,190
Fortunately, the passenger by the window-Henry
always got an aisle seat-was one of those

44
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:47,299
nerveless clods who dozed through flights,
and did not have his window blind open.

45
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:52,760
Stankey was spared the additional stress of
watching the plane's wings dipping and bucking

46
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,709
crazily, straining to break free from the
fuselage.

47
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:05,850
No one who did not feel as he did about flying
realized what a strenuous job it was: three

48
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:12,090
hours in the air, head flung back and eyes
closed, white-knuckled hand wrapped around

49
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:20,090
the hidden bolo-charm, forcing his mind through
an endless circle of airy, buoyant thoughts-helium,

50
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,470
swans down, drifting dandelion puffs.

51
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:30,620
At every bump or shudder his heart began to
speed even more swiftly; he had to redouble

52
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:37,290
his efforts to smooth interference away, to
guide the plane back once more to the path

53
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,470
of least resistance.

54
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,520
The landing was the worst part.

55
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,870
As the captains (infuriatingly bland) voice
announced the beginning of descent, and the

56
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,550
plane nosed downward at a sickening angle,
Henry Stankey pulled back on his seat arms

57
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,250
until his wrists ached.

58
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,940
The pitched whine of the engines mounted to
a panicky scream, and he felt himself gradually

59
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:10,110
lifting from the chairseat, gravity in temporary
abeyance like that time - the one and only

60
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,840
time - he had ridden the old roller coaster
at Playland-by-the-Sea.

61
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,780
His heart climbed into his chest, his stomach
pressed against the bottom of his lungs - but

62
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,190
the man across from him was reading a newspaper!

63
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,100
Calmly extinguishing a cigarette!

64
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,979
Henry closed his eyes again.

65
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:37,120
The seemingly endless fall ended at last.

66
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,490
There was a momentary sensation of leveling
out; the wheels touched, lifted, then hit

67
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,570
the ground once more with the full weight
of the plane upon them.

68
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,970
At once, an even more terrible squalling started
up as the pilot desperately tried to stop

69
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,970
the hurtling plane before it skidded off the
end of the runway into the terminal, to explode

70
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,759
in sun-hot flames.

71
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,889
It didn't explode this time, but rather rolled
down the Texas tarmac to a final stop.

72
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:16,730
The distorted voice of a woman on the PA system
gabbled something at the unheeding customers,

73
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:22,160
who were already up and shouldering their
luggage down from the overhead compartments,

74
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,850
laughing and chattering and pushing up the
aisle.

75
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,430
Back.

76
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,960
Stankey hung limply in his chair.

77
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,360
His shirtfront was creased and sweat-stained
where he had clutched his lucky bolo - but

78
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,000
it had worked!

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,560
Again, somehow beyond all hope he had gotten
through, kept the plane up, then lowered it

80
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,069
once more to the stable earth.

81
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:53,819
As the panic began to recede, he sensed the
high-water mark of his fear; although he had

82
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:59,960
struggled to hold it back, the terror seemed
to have crept higher than ever before.

83
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,740
He felt as though he had been beaten up and
left lying on a downtown sidewalk.

84
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,979
Damn Diana for deserting him!

85
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:12,940
Damn her!

86
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,620
After getting into his hotel room and showering
the sour odor of perspiration from his body,

87
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,979
he slept for an hour - a dark, heavy sleep
that nevertheless smoothed some of the cramping

88
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,000
from his limbs and back.

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,320
By the time he got to the conference room
where the art show would be, ascertained that

90
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,440
his paintings had indeed arrived and began
to set them up in his assigned corner, a feeling

91
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,580
of mild elation began to well inside him.

92
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,979
He had made it by himself, without Diana,
and now could look forward to tonight, Friday,

93
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:54,850
and Saturday before he would need to begin
thinking about the flight back.

94
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,479
A tiny smile worked at the corners of his
mouth as he tacked his paintings into their

95
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:07,800
frames and fussed with the arrangement; it
was good to feel good again.

96
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,419
These conventions were important to him (of
course they must be, he went through Hell

97
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:18,810
to get to them); they were a priceless opportunity
to have his artwork noticed, to touch base

98
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,990
with people who could steer jobs his way and
help him to break through.

99
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,560
He had been just getting by for too long - that
was the worst thing about free-lancing: the

100
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,099
never-knowing, the waiting...

101
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:39,050
waiting for an offer on a cover-bid, waiting
for calls back, waiting to see if a project

102
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,950
would hold together long enough to get him
a guarantee, a kill-fee...

103
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,500
He was grateful for the lightening of spirit
he was suddenly feeling; it was hard enough

104
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:57,330
to make a living without scaring people away
on top of it.

105
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,820
It turned out to be a fairly good convention.

106
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,641
Several people praised his work; he sold two
small paintings, a large pen and ink, and

107
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:09,320
a few smallish sketches.

108
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,690
Roger Norrisert of Lemuria Press dropped some
large hints about an upcoming cover-and-illos

109
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:22,030
possibility for a projected special printing
of a Manly Wade Wellman book.

110
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:27,610
Thursday and Friday passed quickly in a blurry
montage of handshakes and nametag squinting

111
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,570
and several cheerfully tipsy conversations
in the hotel lounge.

112
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:39,510
Both nights he slept deeply, dreamless interludes
that did much to restore his normally affable

113
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,510
outlook.

114
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:45,820
Eating breakfast at a table splashed with
Saturday morning sunlight, he remembered that

115
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,980
there were indeed things he liked about conventions.

116
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,460
That night Stankey went with Norrisert and
a couple of writers to a Cajun restaurant

117
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:01,250
downtown where they sat up late, swapping
stories and drinking beer.

118
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:07,170
Henry got pretty tight, and did not wake until
late Sunday morning.

119
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,510
It had not been a pleasant night.

120
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,390
He had tossed and twitched, pulling the sheets
loose from the mattress.

121
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:19,700
Waking sometime after four in the morning
from a dream of choking (faulty oxygen mask,

122
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:26,320
hole in the hose, smoke everywhere), he had
found his lucky New Mexico string tie twisted

123
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,640
tightly around his neck, bruising his throat.

124
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,490
After worrying it, loose with sleep-clumsy
fingers he had pushed it into the pocket of

125
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,760
his jacket, which hung on a chair beside his
rumpled bed.

126
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,870
Later, after dawdling around the hotel for
a couple of bleak hours watching the Cowboys

127
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:53,029
and the New Orleans Saints play an endless
game of exchanged turnovers, and after laboriously

128
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:58,870
packing and labeling his flats, he found himself
with nothing to do for an hour and a half

129
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:04,910
until the shuttle bus, like Charons ferry,
would whisk him away to the airport.

130
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,390
To the waiting airport.

131
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:14,640
The hotel bar was almost empty, the last knots
of conventioneers clumped around small tables,

132
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,540
luggage at their feet.

133
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,240
Stankey saw no one that he recognized; he
could think of no excuse to introduce himself,

134
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:30,660
to join a conversation and enlist support
in his battle against reflection.

135
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,649
The prospect of the flight home had risen
from its temporary grave and was groping for

136
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:39,399
attention with clammy fingers.

137
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,960
Against his better judgment- needle-sharp,
reflexes were vital in combating the treacherous,

138
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,820
gravity-embracing tendencies of airplanes
- Henry ordered a vodka tonic and nursed it

139
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:57,149
as he sat in a corner seat trying to read
a Ramsey Campbell book.

140
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,510
The drink was a good idea.

141
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,680
It soothed the ragged edges of his thoughts;
he felt it working like aftershave lotion

142
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:12,370
on a just-shaved face, stripping away the
heat, quieting scratchy nerves - well, after

143
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,700
all, aftershave was alcohol, too.

144
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:21,380
He thought, a little cavalierly, of just ordering
another drink, but he knew that was the lulling

145
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,290
effect of the first one at work.

146
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:30,020
He could not afford to be that relaxed: he
was needed, even if the other passengers never

147
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,980
realized it.

148
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,089
Still, the one drink had been a good idea.

149
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,860
The Campbell novel had not.

150
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,040
The dank, depressing Liverpool setting and
the hopelessly phobic thoughts of the characters

151
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,459
made Stankey feel a little sick.

152
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:52,240
He put the book down after thirty pages or
so and stared out the window at the hotel

153
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,820
parking lot, toying with the slowly melting
ice in his glass.

154
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,430
The bus came.

155
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:07,149
It took him, tightlipped and silent, to the
airport, and left him there.

156
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:12,790
On the walkway outside the terminal he could
already feel the acid gnawing at his stomach,

157
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:19,220
the placating effects of the vodka-tonic evaporated
by harsh lights and disembodied, inflectionless

158
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,399
voices, by the chill, echoing vastness of
the place.

159
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,110
He carried his hand luggage to the boarding
area - no massive suitcase in the hold for

160
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,260
him: why make the plane any heavier than it
had to be?

161
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,519
- and stood in line between a Mexican woman
with a screaming child and a boy in a baseball

162
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,980
cap who, except for his drooping, morons mouth,
could have been a Norman Rockwell character.

163
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,630
Some of the other passengers were talking
about something he could not quite catch-the

164
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,740
flight?

165
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,829
- But he would not be distracted.

166
00:13:55,829 --> 00:14:00,470
At last, he reached the front of the line,
put his ticket on the counter, and was told

167
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:06,641
by the female mannequin in the royal blue
vest that the plane was delayed: it would

168
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:11,070
be an hour and twenty-five minutes late taking
off.

169
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,900
She might as well have hit him with a hammer.

170
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:22,110
His defenses were keyed up, he was wound tight
as a mountain climber's rope- and now this!

171
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:27,230
He wanted to shout, to screech at this in
comprehending woman with her twinkly Rose

172
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,870
Parade smile.

173
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,230
Turning hurriedly, he lurched to the high
window where he leaned against a pillar and

174
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,329
willed his heart to slow down.

175
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:39,329
He-would-be-calm.

176
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:44,250
He-would-be-calm.

177
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,380
When he felt a little more in control, he
went to the payphone to call Diana, to tell

178
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,490
her he would be late.

179
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,790
No one answered at home.

180
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,829
It was hard not to feel betrayed.

181
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:04,510
So he sat, staring out at the now-darkening
sky, trying not to watch the technicians scurrying

182
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,899
like parasites beneath the bodies of the big
jets.

183
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:11,820
This was the last time, he vowed to himself.

184
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,339
Never again.

185
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,220
Other artists and writers got by without having
to leave home.

186
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,320
He could take the train if he really needed
to go anywhere, even though it took days.

187
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,640
It was ridiculous to scourge himself this
way.

188
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,350
Nothing in life was worth this kind of sick
fear.

189
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,399
An announcement about his flight crackled
over the PA system.

190
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,019
The message was hard to make out, but he was
positive he had heard the words "mechanical

191
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,720
difficulties."

192
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,790
When he demanded to know what had been said,
the woman at the counter-looking a little

193
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:55,170
amused - confirmed that he had indeed heard
that numbing phrase, that such in fact was

194
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,560
the reason the jet had been delayed in Atlanta.

195
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,089
But, she told him, it was in the air now and
would arrive soon.

196
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:11,020
Under sharp questioning about the nature of
the "difficulties", she professed ignorance,

197
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,759
but assured him that everything was being
taken care of.

198
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,019
This time he went back to his window even
more slowly, like a man mounting thirteen

199
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,910
steps to the gibbet.

200
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:29,529
The counterwoman favored his retreat with
a condescending smile.

201
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:30,899
Damn the bitch.

202
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,990
And damn Diana too, for good measure.

203
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,490
At last, the plane arrived.

204
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,500
Stankey, squinting suspiciously through the
high boarding area windows, could see nothing

205
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,709
overtly wrong - but that, of course, meant
nothing.

206
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:53,470
He would never see the loose bolts that would
vibrate free and drop the engine like a stone,

207
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:58,220
never detect the fault in the landing gear
that would snap the wheel off on contact and

208
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,040
send the jet sliding to flaming oblivion.

209
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,130
He boarded, a stale taste in his mouth, and
found his way to seat 21, near the back of

210
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,260
the plane.

211
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,660
After stowing his shoulder bag, he sat down
and promptly fastened his seat belt, then

212
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,980
reached his hand up to his breastbone to feel
for the lucky bolo tie hanging beneath his

213
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,480
shirt.

214
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,260
It wasn't there.

215
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:32,510
He checked the pockets of his jacket, which
disgorged keys, wallet, ticket folder, receipts,

216
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,670
and matchbooks... but no good-luck talisman.

217
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:41,750
In a growing panic, he unbuckled his lap belt
and sprang up, nearly knocking over the crew-cutted

218
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,919
businessman seating himself across the aisle.

219
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,860
Stankey jerked open the overhead compartment
and levered out his bag, opening it across

220
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:56,500
his lap to rummage through the carefully folded
shirts and socks.

221
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,090
The Mexican woman in the seat before his shifted
her wet-mouthed baby to look over her shoulder

222
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:08,470
at him as he cursed to himself, emptying the
bag with trembling hands.

223
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,770
The bolo tie was nowhere inside.

224
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,270
Henry could dimly remember taking it off in
the night and putting it in the pocket of

225
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,600
his jacket - but he was wearing that jacket
now.

226
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,950
He searched the pockets again, fruitlessly.

227
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:32,309
As he sat in the wreckage of his meticulous
packing, a pert- faced stewardess leaned over

228
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:35,840
to ask if he needed any help.

229
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,870
Unable to speak, he shook his head and began
to stow the clothing back into the bag, dislodging

230
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,390
a stack of convention giveaway magazines,
which slithered to the floor.

231
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:53,650
He excoriated himself and his disability as
he crouched on the cabin floor picking them

232
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,900
up.

233
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,690
A middle-aged woman in a parka waited impatiently
for him to finish so she could get past to

234
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,160
the window seat.

235
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,410
As she slid by, he forced the repacked bag
into the compartment, then slumped back into

236
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,490
his chair.

237
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,900
What could he do?

238
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,980
The damned bolo must have fallen out on the
hotel floor, must even now be in the pocket

239
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,240
of some maid, or lying unnoticed behind the
bed.

240
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,520
He knew how much he needed it.

241
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,250
It had gotten him through every miserable
one of the dozen or so flights he had taken

242
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:39,100
in the last five years - even the one to Wisconsin
where the turbulence had been so bad the seatbelt

243
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,000
sign never went off.

244
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,150
It had gotten him through Thursday's flight,
the first one he had ever taken without Diana.

245
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:54,380
Now he had neither his wife nor his lucky
talisman.

246
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,221
He thought seriously for a moment of simply
getting up and walking off the plane, but

247
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:02,420
he knew that was a foolish idea.

248
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,340
He would still have to get back to San Francisco
somehow, the expensive airline ticket would

249
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:13,409
be wasted, and he would miss the Monday afternoon
meeting with Janicos from Beltane Books...

250
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:17,530
No, he would have to stay on the flight.

251
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:26,390
Again, he cursed his poverty, his childish
fears, his treacherous wife.

252
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,490
The final passengers had boarded, and the
doors were being shut.

253
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:38,160
The compact thump of the vacuum seal sounded
like the coffin lid of the Premature Burial.

254
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,860
He could see the stewardesses walking down
the aisle, checking to make sure the compartment

255
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:51,490
doors were closed - trim, blue-skirted death
angels, hair shining in the cabin lights.

256
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,980
Henry unbuckled his belt again and scrambled
out into the aisle, moving quickly to the

257
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,890
lavatory.

258
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:05,410
In the narrow room, scarcely even a closet,
he felt the surge of claustrophobia.

259
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,830
Why had he come back here?

260
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:14,670
His face in the small mirror looked pale,
haunted; he turned back toward the door.

261
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:22,110
It all felt like a terrible dream, a grinding
nightmare which he could not shut off.

262
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,990
He remembered the Valium in his pocket.

263
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,600
Maybe I can take one of these, he thought....

264
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,580
No, better yet, take two, take three or four,
sleep through the whole damned flight.

265
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,059
If it catches fire on takeoff, so what?

266
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:40,120
I'll never know.

267
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,900
But how would the plane stay aloft?

268
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,340
He knew, somewhere in his fevered thinking,
that planes traveled every day without him

269
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:54,870
on board - lifted off, flew, and landed without
Henry Stankey's straining intercession.

270
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:59,840
It could fly while he slept, just this once...
couldn't it?

271
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,730
Yes, planes did that, but he hadn't been on
one that had.

272
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,590
He had always worked like a dray-horse to
keep them aloft, pulled them along through

273
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:16,419
the turbulent winds that sought to batter
them to the ground like badminton birds.

274
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:20,110
Could he relinquish that control?

275
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,230
He had to.

276
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:26,740
Otherwise, he would never make it - he knew
that as a certainty.

277
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:33,260
Without Diana, it had been nearly impossible;
without either wife or talisman, it was flatly

278
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,900
inconceivable.

279
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,480
And if he couldn't manage the strain, wouldn't
it be better not to see the last moments coming?

280
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,429
To sleep a narcotized sleep through the screeching
final seconds?

281
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:52,299
He was disgusted by his own spinelessness,
by his desertion of his fellow passengers

282
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:58,150
who (although they didn't know it) would be
deprived his valuable assistance in keeping

283
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:04,080
the plane safe and themselves ignorant and
happy... but there was no alternative he could

284
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,990
see.

285
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,910
None.

286
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:13,330
Hands moist with fear-sweat, he unpeeled the
plastic-wrapped pills and plucked two out

287
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,450
of the jumble.

288
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,970
After a moment's consideration, he took up
another pair, then downed them all with a

289
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,659
swallow of water from the tiny sink.

290
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:27,050
Wrapping the remainder, he stumbled back to
his seat.

291
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:32,070
The plane was beginning to roll, heading toward
the takeoff site.

292
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:37,840
As he wedged himself into place and cinched
the belt tightly across his lap, he wondered

293
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,480
if the pills would take long to kick in.

294
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,919
He knew he would have to get through at least
the beginning without help.

295
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:52,200
The jet gathered speed down the runway, engines
howling like late-night-movie Indians bent

296
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,010
on massacre, and Stankey's hand rose reflexively
to his chest.

297
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,539
There was, of course, no charmed bolo tie
to grasp.

298
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:08,380
He clutched his lapel instead, crushing the
material into a wet, wrinkled knot.

299
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,059
Straining, heaving, the plane forced its way
upward.

300
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:18,909
By some miracle, it broke from the ground's
cruel pull and mounted up at a fierce angle

301
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:22,480
to the waiting sky.

302
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,230
Henry Stankey, tendons stretched like violin
strings, waited for either the sickening lurch

303
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:34,630
of lost altitude or the now desperately- awaited
onset of drowsiness.

304
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,070
Drowsiness won.

305
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:42,750
By the time, the aircraft had leveled out
six miles or so above the earth's hidden surface,

306
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:48,539
he could feel languor beginning to creep over
him, as though a warm, wooly blanket was settling

307
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,550
over his body.

308
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,929
His muscles unknotted.

309
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:55,020
His breathing slowed.

310
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:00,280
The woman sitting by the window a seat away
looked at him sharply, questioningly.

311
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:06,309
Henry, growing groggier by the moment, was
even able to muster a thin smile.

312
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:08,400
The woman turned away.

313
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,210
The drone of the airplane made him feel as
though he rode the night in a great, glowing

314
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,490
beehive...

315
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,150
It seemed that he had to claw his way up from
sleep.

316
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:26,620
The tarbaby grip of the Valium held him back,
but a part of his mind knew that he was urgently

317
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:33,020
needed: even as he clambered up from unconsciousness
he could feel the plane lurching and rocking,

318
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,409
the cabin rattling like a toy in a child's
fist.

319
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:42,140
He opened his eyes, fighting for wakefulness...
and knew he had been right.

320
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:49,010
All his fears were now confirmed - he should
never have taken those pills, never have relinquished

321
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,780
control!

322
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:57,150
He moaned, straining to dislodge the tendrils
of sleep.

323
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:01,300
The faces of his fellow passengers told all.

324
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:06,320
This time no one was reading unconcernedly
or chatting with neighbors.

325
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,520
Like Stankey, they gripped their seat arms
and stared straight ahead as the plane bucked

326
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,870
and swerved.

327
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,770
Eyes stared darkly from pale faces.

328
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:23,450
The Mexican woman clutched her sobbing baby;
Henry could hear her voice moving in the urgent,

329
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,010
rhythmic cadences of prayer.

330
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,630
A sudden lurch and the plane plummeted, a
drop that seemed to last minutes, like the

331
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,880
freefall of an amusement park ride.

332
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,320
One woman's voice rose in a brief, muffled
shriek.

333
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,440
The plane bottomed out, climbed a moment,
stabilized.

334
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,510
There was none of the usual nervous laughter;
the heaving and the battering side-to-side

335
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,210
swaying continued.

336
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:55,010
Above the tense muttering of the passengers,
Stankey heard the voice of the captain on

337
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,120
the intercom.

338
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,390
Even as he spoke, the stewardesses hurried
down the aisle to the back of the plane.

339
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,860
There was another sickening plunge, and a
meal tray tumbled out of a passenger's grip

340
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,590
to carom down the aisle, scattering food everywhere.

341
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,620
The flight attendants did not even look down
as they made their way back to their own seats

342
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,590
to strap in.

343
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:22,380
To Henry, this was the grimmest proof of all.

344
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,299
Was it too late?

345
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:29,260
He strained outward with his mind, murky thoughts
wrestling with the shivering plane and its

346
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,620
staggering attempts to defy gravity.

347
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,180
For a moment, he thought he could do it.

348
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,919
The lights blinked on and off, the captain's
voice gargled through the cabin... fasten

349
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,370
seat belts, stay calm... turbulence...

350
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:49,830
Henry concentrated his will, fighting treacherous
sleepiness; the plane seemed to settle a bit,

351
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,720
its passage momentarily smoothed.

352
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,520
The shuddering became less.

353
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,720
Almost without knowing Stankey relaxed - just
a little, the most minute's concession to

354
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,990
the downward drag of the medication - and
lost it.

355
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:11,110
The plane heaved like a gutshot dinosaur and
rolled to one side.

356
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:16,540
Several of the overhead compartments burst
open, vomiting luggage on the shouting passengers.

357
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:22,850
Suitcases somersaulted down the aisle in slow
motion; a blind man's cane, folded in segments,

358
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:28,600
accordioned out from his seat to fly end over
end through the cabin like a bizarre albino

359
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,970
insect.

360
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:36,450
The airplane hung for a moment on its side:
Stankey felt himself dangling across his seat

361
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:42,289
arm, sliding toward the gap-mouthed face of
the woman by the window.

362
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:46,690
The glass behind her looked out on black,
formless emptiness.

363
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,520
The plane nosed down so steeply that it seemed
to Henry the passengers near the front of

364
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:58,149
the cabin had fallen down a hole, a hole from
which he was being dragged by some fierce

365
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:05,250
power, pulled back against his seat, chest
and lungs crushed in a giant's grip.

366
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:11,080
The cabin was suddenly a lively Hell of flailing
arms and flying objects.

367
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:17,490
A woman's faint voice screamed: heads down
heads down heads down...!

368
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:23,220
The turbine shriek of the wind buried all
other sounds; the mouths that gaped and worked

369
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:29,429
without words joined their last cries to the
panicked roar of the plummeting airplane.

370
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:35,159
Sound cutting through his head like a jigsaw,
Stankey screamed too - screamed out his despair

371
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:42,540
and terror, screeched out wordless curses
at what fate, his wife, his own fear had done

372
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,510
to him.

373
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:51,470
He struggled to force himself up against the
shocking, smashing pressure of pitched descent.

374
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,840
It wasn't fair!

375
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,529
He had tried everything!

376
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:59,090
He had to take the pills, couldn't have kept
the plane up this time!

377
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,230
Why?!

378
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,370
Why?!

379
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:06,970
Whywhywhywhywhywhywhy...

380
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,970
Impact

381
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:14,640
Time... is... stopping.

382
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,820
Henry feels himself standing at last... a
man at last... on his feet.

383
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:27,640
He is thrown forward - his flight as inexorable
but unhurried as the slide of a black-ice

384
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:35,980
glacier (time now creeping as slowly as eroding
stone)-forward like a stop-motion film of

385
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:42,940
a plant growing, unfolding, hurtling forward
but barely moving...

386
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:49,650
The passengers around him are a frozen flash
photograph, eyes bulging...

387
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:57,000
suitcases hang in the air like corpuscles
in the clear ichor of a god's arteries.

388
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,990
The walls of the plane wrinkle, contract around
him, surge toward the nose; the seats fold

389
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:12,919
forward like a row of dominoes, the passengers
folding with them - slowly, slowly, like a

390
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:17,470
child's pop-up book being carefully closed.

391
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:25,850
Stankey, unfettered, is passing through them
all now, flowing remorselessly forward, sliding

392
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:31,570
through the dividing substance of passengers
and objects like a bullet tumbling through

393
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,830
a sand castle.

394
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:41,789
The way opens before him, a kaleidoscopic
mandala of blood and bone and fabric and torn

395
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:50,390
metal - a succession of slow-blooming, intricate
flowers through which he tumbles like a bee

396
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,930
in melting amber.

397
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:59,649
His journey to the crystalline heart of the
petals takes millennia.

398
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:08,180
Slower now, slower... matter bunching up,
molecule on static molecule...

399
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,860
Dense.

400
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,540
Denser.

401
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
Densest...

402
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:21,289
...Until Time itself falls behind his ultimate
slowness, until only the remembrance remains,

403
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:31,700
the memory of the light years of waiting before
the next tick of atomic decay and then he

404
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,399
is through...

405
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,720
The morgue attendant slides the drawer back
in.

406
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,950
The widow is led out by friends; her shoulders
heave.

407
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:48,309
When she is gone, he pulls the drawer out
again and stares at the body.

408
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:53,380
He twitches the sheet aside to look at the
bruised pelvis, the mottled black and yellow

409
00:32:53,380 --> 00:33:02,529
bars where the victim broke the seatbelt across
his own body struggling to rise from his seat.

410
00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:08,580
The airline says that the victim had slept
through the whole flight until the last descent,

411
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:15,670
when he began to shout and writhe in his sleep,
in the depths of an unbreathable dream.

412
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:19,530
Unwaking, he had struggled with the seat.

413
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:26,590
With gravity, with the belt itself until he
snapped it loose - the heavy canvas torn by

414
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:34,659
a near-incomprehensible strength - and had
stood shouting in the aisle, eyes shut.

415
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:39,169
When the wheels touched the runway, the airline
representative said, the man had screamed

416
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:44,500
once and fallen forward, dead.

417
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,080
The attendant looks the body up and down and
shakes his head.

418
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,130
He slides it back inside on near-silent rollers.

419
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,730
A heart attack, they say.

420
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,720
Extreme shock and terror, they say.

421
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,770
So, the attendant wonders, why is the corpse
smiling?

422
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:12,700
...he has come through - and Henry Stankey
is no more.

423
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:21,129
He is a mote of light passing through a radiant
universe, speeding through unending brightness.

424
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:23,179
And flying is a joy.

425
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:23,330
- THE END -
