CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,920
An Island without a King

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,680
''If you prefer to destroy my property, then stay.  

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,320
But I will ask Zeus for a day of judgement, 
and on that day I will destroy you.'

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,960
Odysseus's unlucky fate is causing me great 
sadness,' said the goddess Athene to her father,  

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:38,400
the great god Zeus. 'It is now twenty years since 
he has seen his home and loving family. Zeus,  

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,600
Father, King of Kings, why are you 
doing nothing to help this man?'

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,360
'I have not forgotten the great hero 
Odysseus, my child,' replied Zeus.  

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,880
'You are right - his troubles have continued 
long enough. We should bring him home.'

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:10,560
'Thank you, Father,' said bright-eyed 
Athene. 'First I will go to Odysseus's palace  

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,920
and talk to his son, young Telemachus. I 
must make him ready for his father's return.'

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,360
Athene put on her shoes of gold, which carried 
her as fast as the wind down from Mount Olympus,  

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,160
over land and sea, to the island of Ithaca. 
As she arrived at Odysseus's palace,  

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,560
she disguised herself as a man called 
Mentes, a family friend of Odysseus.

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,920
Outside the house she found a group of men playing 
a noisy game while servants were busy around them.  

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
Some of the servants were 
mixing wine and water in bowls;  

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,880
others were piling meat onto plates 
and preparing the tables for dinner.  

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:13,360
Odysseus's son, Telemachus, was sitting unhappily 
among the men, dreaming of his father's return.

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,280
Telemachus saw Athene in her disguise, and felt 
ashamed that no one was greeting the visitor.  

20
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,200
He hurried towards her. 'Welcome, friend!' 
he said. 'Come and have some food.  

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,840
Then you can tell us why you are here.'

22
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,520
He led Athene to a table away from the other men, 
worried that his visitor would be upset by their  

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:51,600
noise and rudeness. A servant poured water into a 
fine silver bowl so they could wash their hands.  

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:03,840
Then plates of bread and meat were brought, 
and their gold cups were filled with wine.

25
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,640
The other men also ate well, then 
called for a song from the bard Phemius.  

26
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:20,560
As Phemius began, Telemachus said to his guest, 
'Those men over there worry about nothing  

27
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:31,840
except music. They have an easy life, living free 
while another man pays! If Odysseus returned now,  

28
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,920
they would wish for a faster pair 
of legs, not gold or fine clothes.  

29
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:47,440
But unfortunately that will never happen. 
My father was once the king of this island,  

30
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:56,160
but now his bones are probably being washed by the 
rain in a faraway land, or by the salt sea waves.  

31
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
No one can give us any news of him.  

32
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,600
But tell me, what is your name, and 
what is the reason for your visit?'

33
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:17,440
'My name is Mentes,' answered bright-eyed 
Athene. 'My family and yours have been friends  

34
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,000
for many years. I am here because I heard 
that your father had already arrived home.  

35
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,280
The gods must be making his journey difficult, 
but I am sure that he is still alive.  

36
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,880
He is a resourceful man; he 
will think of a way to get home.  

37
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:48,160
But are you really Odysseus's son? You have grown 
so tall! You certainly have your father's eyes -  

38
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:56,080
although I have not seen him for twenty years, 
since he left to fight in the Trojan War.'

39
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,600
'Sometimes I wish I had a different father, 
who was growing old in his own home,'  

40
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:10,080
Telemachus replied. 'Odysseus is the most 
unfortunate man that has ever lived.'

41
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,200
'He is lucky, at least, in his choice of 
wife, the loving Penelope. But tell me,  

42
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,840
what are you celebrating with this special 
meal? And who are these men, who bring no food  

43
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,080
but behave like the owners of the house? 
I have never seen such impolite guests.'

44
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:40,480
'My friend,' Telemachus replied, 'these men 
have a meal like this every day of the year.  

45
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,520
My father's disappearance has 
brought disaster to this house.  

46
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:55,760
Many great heroes died in the Trojan War, but 
their sons are lucky. Their fathers left them  

47
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:06,160
a famous name. Odysseus was still alive at the 
end of the war, but he has left me only tears.  

48
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:14,080
These men have come from Ithaca and neighbouring 
lands, hoping to marry my mother. She does not  

49
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,600
want to accept any of her suitors. But with no 
news of my father, she cannot refuse them all.  

50
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,960
They wait for her answer, eating and 
drinking until we are nearly ruined.'

51
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:38,800
'How terrible!' the goddess replied. 'They 
will die if your father ever finds them here.  

52
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,120
But while he is away, you must try 
to change the situation yourself.  

53
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:54,800
Here is my advice. Choose your best ship, 
hire a crew of twenty strong oarsmen,  

54
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,840
and go in search of news of your father. 
Someone may be able to tell you about him.  

55
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:12,640
Go to Pylos first and question its king, 
wise Nestor. Then continue to King Menelaus  

56
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:21,040
in Sparta, since he was the last of the Greeks to 
reach home. If you hear that your father is alive,  

57
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,520
prepare yourself for another year with the 
suitors. But if you hear that he is dead, give  

58
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,600
your mother in marriage to another man and end the 
suitors' stay in your house. You are not a child  

59
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:46,880
now. Act like a man, and your grandchildren's 
grandchildren will celebrate your name. But it  

60
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:56,160
is getting late. I must return to my ship or my 
crew will start to worry. Think about my advice.'

61
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,400
'Thank you, good Mentes,' Telemachus said warmly.  

62
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,760
'You have shown me the kindness of a father to 
his son. But will you not stay a little longer?  

63
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:18,720
Have a bath and relax. Then you can go back to 
your ship with a gift from my house - something  

64
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,040
beautiful and valuable, as you 
have proved to be a good friend.'

65
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:32,160
'No,' replied Athene. 'I am in a hurry to 
get back to my ship and reach my destination,  

66
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:39,840
the port of Temesa. But I will be 
glad to accept a gift on my way home.'

67
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:50,240
When she had finished speaking, the goddess 
disappeared suddenly, like a bird through a  

68
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:57,840
hole in the roof. Telemachus was left feeling 
braver and more resourceful than before.  

69
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,160
Noticing this change, he realised 
that a god had been with him.

70
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,200
His mind was filled with thoughts of 
his father as he rejoined the suitors.  

71
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,480
He found them listening in silence to Phemius,  

72
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,840
who was singing about the Greeks' problems 
on their return from the Trojan War.

73
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,680
In her rooms upstairs, Penelope 
could hear the bard too.  

74
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,760
She came down the stairs with tears in her eyes.

75
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:41,360
'Phemius,' she said, 'you know so many wonderful 
songs about great heroes and powerful gods.  

76
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,160
Choose one of those songs for tonight, and 
let the men here drink their wine in peace.  

77
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,560
But give us no more of your present 
song. It always makes me cry.  

78
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,840
In the events of your story, no one lost 
a dearer or a better husband than I,  

79
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,240
whose husband is famous in 
every corner of Greece.'

80
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,480
But wise young Telemachus interrupted 
Penelope. 'Mother,' he said, 'do not  

81
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:22,560
stop our great bard from entertaining us as he 
chooses. The gods are responsible for our fates,  

82
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:31,200
not the songs of a bard. It is not surprising 
that Phemius has chosen this story, as the newest  

83
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:39,200
songs are always the most popular. Go back to your 
rooms, Mother, and busy yourself with your work.  

84
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,800
I am the master of this house, so leave 
decisions about the entertainment here to me.'

85
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:56,880
Penelope was surprised by her son's words, but 
she knew that he spoke wisely. She returned to  

86
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:04,480
her rooms, and there she lay crying for Odysseus 
until the goddess Athene closed her eyes in sleep.

87
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,720
Back in the hall, the suitors were shouting and 
joking about their hopes to marry the beautiful  

88
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:21,360
lady of the house. Telemachus stood up and 
spoke to them. 'Gentlemen,' he said, 'this  

89
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:31,520
is not the way for suitors to behave. Stop this 
rudeness! Let us enjoy the food and the song -  

90
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:38,400
Phemius has the voice of a god. But tomorrow 
morning there is going to be a meeting.  

91
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,400
I am going to make a formal 
request that you leave my house.  

92
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:53,680
After tonight, eat your meals somewhere else. 
If you prefer to destroy my property, then stay.  

93
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:03,360
But I will ask Zeus for a day of judgement, 
and on that day I will destroy you.'

94
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,920
The suitors were shocked by Telemachus's 
new confidence. For a moment they did  

95
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:20,720
not know what to say. Then Antinous spoke. 
'Are the gods teaching you this arrogance,  

96
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:29,760
Telemachus? If you are already so arrogant 
now, I hope you never become king of Ithaca.'

97
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:38,480
'I will gladly become king if the gods 
wish it,' replied Telemachus. 'But many  

98
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,840
other princes in Greece want that title and 
they are welcome to it, since my father is dead.  

99
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:54,320
I just want to be the master of my own house, 
and of the servants won by my father in war.'

100
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:07,040
Eurymachus now spoke. 'You are right, Telemachus. 
The gods must decide who Ithaca's next king will  

101
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:16,640
be. And you should keep your own property and rule 
your own house. But tell us, who was your guest  

102
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:25,280
and where was he from? Did he bring news of your 
father, or was he here on business of his own?  

103
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,160
He left so quickly that we had 
no opportunity to meet him.'

104
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,160
'There is never any news of my father. We 
must accept that he is not coming back.  

105
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,320
My guest was Mentes, an old friend of my father.'  

106
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,640
Telemachus did not tell them what he knew in 
his heart - that Mentes was a god in disguise.

107
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,280
The rest of the evening was spent 
dancing and listening to music.  

108
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,200
When it grew dark, the suitors 
slowly returned to their own homes.  

109
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:15,840
In his bedroom, Telemachus lay awake all 
night, thinking about Athene's advice.

110
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,160
The next morning, he called the 
people of Ithaca to a meeting.  

111
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:30,000
When everyone was ready, Telemachus walked to the 
meeting-place with only two dogs as companions.  

112
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,800
He looked so proud and confident that 
everyone's eyes turned to him in admiration.  

113
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,840
The older men moved away so that 
he could take his father's seat.

114
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:52,720
Telemachus stood to address the people. 'I called 
this meeting, gentlemen, to ask for your help.  

115
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,440
Great trouble has fallen on my house. 
First, I have lost my father, Odysseus.  

116
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:11,440
But worse than this, a second problem will soon 
ruin me. A group of suitors spend their days in  

117
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:19,920
our house, eating our animals and drinking our 
wine. Soon all our property will be wasted.  

118
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Some of the suitors are from the families of 
Ithaca - some are even here, among us now.  

119
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:36,480
Tell them to leave my mother alone. Or did you 
dislike my father Odysseus's treatment of you,  

120
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,840
and think that our house deserves these 
troubles? I would gladly fight all the suitors  

121
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:53,840
if I had the strength. But I am one and they 
are many. I cannot defend our house alone.'

122
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:02,320
As he spoke, his anger grew, and at the end 
of his speech his eyes were wet with tears.  

123
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:13,120
Many people felt sorry for Telemachus. No 
one spoke - until Antinous broke the silence.

124
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:23,440
'What a speech, Telemachus!' he said. 'And 
what anger! You blame me and the other suitors  

125
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:30,240
for your troubles, but you are wrong. The 
fault is not ours, but your own mother's.  

126
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:40,400
For nearly four years she has made us wait for 
her answer. She gives each of us a reason to hope  

127
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,560
for her hand in marriage. She 
makes promises in private messages,  

128
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:56,400
but she never keeps those promises. And then there 
was that shroud. "I need to finished it before I  

129
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:05,280
marry again," she told us. "It is to cover the 
body of Odysseus's father, Laertes, when he dies.  

130
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,320
It would be bad for my reputation if such 
a great lord had no shroud on his death."  

131
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:21,920
We decided to be patient and agree to her 
wishes. She worked on the shroud every day,  

132
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:32,160
but at night she undid all her work. For 
three years she tricked us in this way.  

133
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,840
In the end, one of her servants told us of 
her dishonesty, and we forced her to complete  

134
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:49,360
the shroud. But still she has not chosen a 
husband. This is the suitors' answer, Telemachus.  

135
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,920
Tell your mother to stop her tricks. 
We will not leave your house in peace  

136
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,560
until she has made her choice 
and married one of us.'

137
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,720
'I cannot force her to marry while she 
still hopes for my father's return,'  

138
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:17,760
replied Telemachus. 'If I did that, the anger 
of the gods would bring me even more disasters.  

139
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,360
Go and eat your meals somewhere else.  

140
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,480
If you stay, the gods will surely 
punish you for your unlawful behavior.'

141
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:38,240
The great god Zeus was listening to his words and 
sent two eagles to fly above the meeting-place.  

142
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,240
In the sky, the birds attacked each other,  

143
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,680
biting each other's faces and necks 
before flying away over the town.  

144
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,840
The people stared at the birds, asking 
themselves what this sign from the gods meant.

145
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,960
Halitherses, a wise old man 
skilled in prophecy, spoke first.  

146
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:16,960
'People of Ithaca, and suitors too, hear my 
words. Odysseus will not be absent much longer,  

147
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,080
and his return will bring a violent end 
to the lives of these arrogant suitors.  

148
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,480
This will be a disaster for many of us on Ithaca. 
We must stop the suitors before it is too late.  

149
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,280
Or even better, the suitors should 
stop their bad behavior themselves.'

150
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:53,520
The suitor Eurymachus stood to reply. 'Go home, 
old man,' he laughed. 'Tell your stories to your  

151
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:02,880
children and leave us to understand the signs 
of the gods. But now I will make a prophecy.  

152
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,080
If you say anything more about Odysseus's 
return or disaster for the suitors,  

153
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:19,000
you yourself will meet a violent end. 
And this is my advice to Telemachus:  

154
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:27,200
he should order his mother to choose a husband. 
Until she does this, the suitors will never leave.  

155
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,360
We are afraid of no one - and certainly 
not of Telemachus and his brave words.'

156
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,480
Mentor, an old friend of Odysseus, 
spoke now. 'People of Ithaca,  

157
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:55,520
do you care nothing for Odysseus, who ruled you 
with the love of a father? Why should a king aim  

158
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:03,120
to be fair and kind to his people, if this is your 
repayment? The suitors are few and you are many.  

159
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,000
But you sit here in silence and say nothing 
to criticize their shocking behavior.'

160
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,280
The suitors shouted over Mentor's 
words, but Telemachus silenced them.  

161
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:27,680
'Eurymachus and you other suitors,' he said, 
'I will say no more. The gods and the people of  

162
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:35,520
Ithaca have heard my request. But now, I need 
a fast ship and a crew of twenty strong men.  

163
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:46,640
I am going to Pylos and Sparta to ask for news of 
my father. If I hear that he is alive, I will wait  

164
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,680
one more year. But if I hear that he is dead, I 
will give my mother in marriage to a new husband.'

165
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,440
The suitors laughed at his plan, saying 
that he would never even find a crew.  

166
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,560
And so the meeting ended.

167
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:18,000
Telemachus went to the seashore to think. Athene 
came to him there, this time disguised as his  

168
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:28,480
father's Ithacan friend Mentor. 'Do not worry 
about the suitors,' she said. 'They are fools.  

169
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,480
The resourceful son of a resourceful 
father has nothing to fear from them.  

170
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:43,840
I myself will be your companion on your journey. 
Go back to your house and get food and wine,  

171
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:53,920
while I find you a ship and a crew.' Telemachus 
returned to his house, where he found the suitors  

172
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:02,320
preparing for another great dinner. With 
a laugh, Antinous ran up to him. 'Come and  

173
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:09,520
eat with us,' he called. 'And later I will 
help you find a ship for your journey.'

174
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:18,080
'I will make my own arrangements for a ship 
- and for a nasty end for you suitors too,'  

175
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,480
replied Telemachus.

176
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,280
Hearing this, all the suitors started shouting.  

177
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:32,480
'He is planning to bring back an army from 
Pylos to cut our throats!' laughed one.

178
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,800
'Perhaps he will buy some poison to 
put in our wine-bowl!' cried another.

179
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,840
'Or he may get lost at sea like his 
father. Oh, how sad that would be!  

180
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,200
We would have so much trouble sharing his 
property between us all!' added a third.

181
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:02,240
Telemachus let them talk. He went downstairs and 
unlocked a room full of his father's treasure.  

182
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:11,440
There were piles of gold and silver, clothes, 
and jars of oil and wine. Everything was being  

183
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:20,000
kept safe for Odysseus's return by his loyal 
servant Eurycleia. Odysseus's father, Laertes,  

184
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,920
had bought Eurycleia when she was still a girl, 
for the price of twenty cows. She had looked  

185
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:34,720
after both Odysseus and Telemachus when they were 
babies, and no one loved them more than she did.

186
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,920
Calling the old woman now to 
the room, Telemachus said,  

187
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:48,080
'Please could you get twelve jars of fine wine for 
me, and plenty of food? But do not tell anyone!  

188
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,480
I will come and collect it this evening, when 
my mother has gone upstairs for the night.  

189
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,480
I am going to Pylos and Sparta 
to ask for news of my father.'

190
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:10,640
There were tears in Eurycleia's eyes as she 
replied, 'Dear child, no! The suitors will  

191
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:18,320
find a way to murder you on your journey and 
share all this wealth between them. Stay here,  

192
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,960
at home with your mother, where you belong. Do 
not go looking for trouble on the stormy seas.'

193
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,920
'Please do not worry, 
Eurycleia,' answered Telemachus.  

194
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,200
'I have the gods on my side. But promise me that 
you will not tell my mother that I have gone.  

195
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,840
We do not want to upset her for no reason.'

196
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,920
Eurycleia promised to keep his secret and 
started organising the food and drink.  

197
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,240
Telemachus went back upstairs to 
the hall and rejoined the suitors.

198
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,400
At the same time, Athene was going round the 
town disguised as Telemachus, choosing twenty  

199
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:10,160
strong men for the ship's crew. She had already 
borrowed a ship from an Ithacan man called Noemon.  

200
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:18,240
When the ship and crew were ready, she returned 
to Odysseus's palace and made the suitors sleepy.  

201
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,320
They soon found that they 
could not keep their eyes open,  

202
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,600
so one after the other they went to bed.

203
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:35,840
Athene took on the appearance of Mentor again, 
and went to find Telemachus. 'Come,' she said to  

204
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:44,240
him. 'Twenty companions are sitting at their oars, 
waiting to start their journey. Let us not delay.'

205
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,840
Telemachus followed Athene to the ship. 
The food and wine was carried on board,  

206
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,840
and soon they were at sea. Athene called 
for a good wind to take them to Pylos,  

207
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,600
and Telemachus ordered his men to put up the sail.  

208
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:12,720
As night turned to day, the ship was making 
good progress on its way to Pylos.
 
 
 

209
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,600
CHAPTER TWO

210
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,320
Telemachus's Travels

211
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,000
'If Odysseus ever proved that he was your friend  

212
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,840
in the hard years of the war, tell me 
everything that you know about his death.'

213
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:40,480
As Telemachus and his companions came near to 
Pylos, they saw a great crowd of people on the  

214
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:48,720
beach, including King Nestor and his family. 
Telemachus's crew brought the ship to land.  

215
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,680
Then they all followed Athene, who was 
still disguised as Mentor, onto the shore.

216
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:06,000
Telemachus was the last to leave the ship. As 
they walked towards the crowd, Athene said to him,  

217
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:13,680
'Remember, this is not a time to be 
shy. We are here to find out how your  

218
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:21,600
father's life ended. Go, then, and ask 
Nestor confidently if he has any news.'

219
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:31,200
'But I will be embarrassed, talking in public to 
Nestor,' Telemachus replied. 'He is so much older  

220
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,800
than me and so famous. I have no experience 
of public life. How should I speak to him?'

221
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:47,840
'Do not worry,' Athene advised. 'When your 
own words fail you, the gods will help.  

222
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,920
They are looking kindly on this journey of yours.'

223
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,960
When they reached the crowd, they 
were greeted warmly by Nestor  

224
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,760
and his family, who had just made a 
sacrifice to the sea-god Poseidon.  

225
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,640
The king's son, Peisistratus, offered 
them some meat from the sacrificed cows,  

226
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:21,520
and servants poured them some wine. After they 
had finished the wonderful food, Nestor spoke.  

227
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,880
'Who are you, friends, and where have you come 
from? What is your business here in Pylos?'

228
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,920
Athene gave Telemachus the confidence to reply.  

229
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:45,440
'Nestor, son of Neleus, great hero of the 
Greeks, we are from the island of Ithaca.  

230
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,680
I have come here looking for news of 
my father, long-suffering Odysseus.  

231
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,080
It is said that he fought by your 
side until the end of the Trojan War.  

232
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,720
But he has never come home, and no one 
can tell us when or where he died.'

233
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:16,640
'Ah, my friend,' cried King Nestor, 'what memories 
I have of that long war! It would take years just  

234
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:25,120
to tell you of all the disasters that struck us 
at Troy. We lost our best men there - Achilles,  

235
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:35,840
Patroclus, and my own son Antilochus 
too, a handsome boy, fast and strong.

236
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:44,800
'For nine years we tried to beat the Trojans, 
but Zeus threw many difficulties in our path.  

237
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:54,560
In all those years, no one showed better 
judgment than Odysseus - your father, if you  

238
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:01,680
really are his son. It is not hard to believe, 
since you look and speak exactly like him.  

239
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,320
In all those long years, your wise father and I 
never once spoke on opposite sides of an argument.  

240
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,840
At every stage of the war, we 
agreed on the best plan of action.

241
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:26,240
'After we destroyed the city of Troy, we 
left in our ships. But then Zeus sent us  

242
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,080
all in different directions, because some 
people among us had displeased the gods.  

243
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,880
We had arguments about the route home, 
and some ships were caught by storms.  

244
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:48,640
I myself was lucky - my voyage was very smooth. 
So I heard no news of the other commanders.'

245
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:58,000
'But what is the news from Ithaca? Are the stories 
true, that a crowd of your mother's suitors are  

246
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,880
living as uninvited guests in your house? I only 
wish that the goddess Athene showed you some  

247
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:12,320
of the kindness that helped your father so much 
during the war. If she cared for you like that,  

248
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,440
the suitors would soon have their 
thoughts of marriage knocked out of them.'

249
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:24,640
'Good Nestor,' replied Telemachus, 'I 
cannot hope for an end to my troubles  

250
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,040
with the suitors, even if it 
is the gods' dearest wish.'

251
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,400
'Telemachus,' interrupted bright-eyed Athene,  

252
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,920
'what are you saying? Nothing is 
impossible if the gods are helping you.'

253
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,000
'The gods have already sent my 
father to his death, Mentor,'  

254
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,000
said Telemachus to the goddess. 'Is 
that their way of helping my family?'

255
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:02,400
'Well, my advice to you, Telemachus,' continued 
Nestor, 'is to go home quickly and guard your  

256
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:11,120
property from the greedy suitors. But there is 
one more person that you should visit. Menelaus  

257
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:18,640
has only just returned home, after years lost at 
sea. Perhaps he will have news of your father.  

258
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,440
Go now, with your ship and crew; 
or my sons can go with you by land,  

259
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,640
and show you the way to red-haired 
Menelaus's palace in Sparta.'

260
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,840
Darkness was falling, so Nestor invited 
them to stay the night at the palace.

261
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:46,800
'You are very kind, my lord,' said Athene. 
'Telemachus will gladly accept your invitation,  

262
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,160
but I must return to the ship. In the morning 
the crew and I must continue our voyage.  

263
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:02,160
Telemachus can travel to Sparta in one of your 
chariots, if your son can be his companion.'

264
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,400
When she finished, the goddess 
turned into a bird and flew away.  

265
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:17,120
Nestor and Telemachus stared at the sky in 
shock. 'Telemachus, my boy!' cried Nestor,  

266
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:24,480
'I think your friend Mentor was 
really Athene, whose help was so  

267
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,600
valuable to your father. With a goddess at your 
side, you have a great future ahead of you!'

268
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,560
Telemachus spent the night in Nestor's palace,  

269
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,680
and in the morning Nestor's son Peisistratus 
called for a chariot to take them to Sparta.

270
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,040
They arrived two days later and found 
Menelaus celebrating a family wedding.  

271
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,680
A bard and dancers were entertaining the 
guests in the hall as they ate their dinner.

272
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:10,480
Telemachus and Peisistratus stopped their chariot 
outside the palace. Menelaus's friend Eteoneus  

273
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:18,000
came out of the hall and saw them there. He 
hurried to his king, saying, 'There are two  

274
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,160
strangers at the gates. Should we welcome them 
inside or ask them to continue on their journey?'

275
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:33,600
Red-haired Menelaus answered him angrily. 
'Eteoneus, you are not usually a fool,  

276
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,280
but you are certainly talking like one now. 
You and I enjoyed the welcome of strangers in  

277
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:49,200
many far lands before we reached home. Go and help 
our guests at once, and invite them to join us.'

278
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,560
Telemachus and Peisistratus were soon 
following Eteoneus into the palace,  

279
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,480
where they were washed by the servant-girls 
and dressed in fine new clothes.

280
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,360
Then they took their seats 
next to Menelaus in the hall.

281
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,240
The servants brought them food and 
drink and Menelaus greeted them warmly.  

282
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:22,960
Telemachus whispered to Peisistratus, 'Look 
at this room! Have you ever seen so much gold?  

283
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,880
Surely even Zeus's palace on Mount 
Olympus does not shine as brightly!'

284
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:37,680
Menelaus heard his words and said, 'No one's home 
can compare with the palace of the gods, dear boy.  

285
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,120
But few ordinary men have collected 
more treasure than I have.  

286
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,600
For seven long years I travelled the world 
and made my fortune - in Cyprus, Egypt,  

287
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:59,760
Ethiopia and Libya. But there were many hard 
times during those years, and while I was away,  

288
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,960
my brother was cruelly murdered by his wife 
and her lover. I would happily exchange all  

289
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,520
the gold and silver in this house for the return 
of my brother and the friends who I lost at Troy.  

290
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,960
But although I miss every 
one of my lost companions,  

291
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,440
there is one whose death upsets 
me even more than the rest.  

292
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:33,520
Odysseus always tried harder, fought harder, 
thought harder than anyone else in the war.  

293
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:42,640
But his resourcefulness did not help him in the 
end. He has never returned home. I often think  

294
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:52,240
of his family - his father, old Laertes, his 
loyal wife, Penelope, and his son Telemachus,  

295
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:00,480
who was only a baby when Odysseus left for the 
war. It must be hard to wait for him year after  

296
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:09,600
year. They have probably given up waiting now. 
It is twenty years since he was last in Ithaca.'

297
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:19,200
These words brought tears to Telemachus s 
eyes, and Menelaus realized at once who his  

298
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:27,600
young visitor must be. As he was deciding what to 
say to him, his wife Helen arrived in the hall.  

299
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:36,240
Everyone's eyes followed her across the room in 
admiration. Long ago, her beauty had been the  

300
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:45,040
cause of the Trojan War. A Trojan prince, Paris, 
had stolen her from her husband's home in Sparta  

301
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:51,600
and taken her to live with him in Troy. The 
Greeks had attacked the Trojans to win her back.  

302
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:59,840
Now, returned to her loving husband, her 
goddess-like beauty still shone bright.

303
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,920
One of her ladies helped her into a chair; another 
brought her a fine blanket of the softest wool;  

304
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,560
a third passed her her silver work-basket, 
a gift from a friend in Egypt.  

305
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,400
As Helen started her work, she asked 
her husband about the visitors.

306
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:28,400
'Do we know their names, Menelaus? I must 
say, that young man looks exactly like  

307
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:36,080
Odysseus. Could he be Odysseus's son, who was only 
a baby when the Greek army followed me to Troy?'

308
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,800
'I think you are right,' her husband replied.  

309
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,160
'A few minutes ago he was crying when 
I spoke of my memories of Odysseus.'

310
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:56,800
Peisistratus now spoke. 'Menelaus, great 
king, you have guessed rightly. My friend  

311
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:06,320
here is Odysseus's son, Telemachus, and I am 
Peisistratus, son of Nestor. Because Telemachus  

312
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:12,880
is shy in the company of great men like yourself, 
my father asked me to be his companion here.'

313
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,520
'Well, he is a very welcome visitor,'  

314
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,720
cried Menelaus. 'I had hoped to build his 
father a home near mine, so that we could  

315
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:32,960
meet regularly and continue to be friends. But a 
jealous god has robbed me of this happy future.'

316
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:41,920
Everyone's eyes filled with tears. For some 
time they were silent, lost in their own  

317
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:50,240
unhappy thoughts, until Peisistratus said, 
'The dead deserve our tears, but this is  

318
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,200
meant to be a wedding celebration. 
Let us talk of happier subjects.'

319
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:03,520
'Wise words, Peisistratus,' replied Menelaus. 
'You have your father's good sense.'  

320
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,840
He called for more food and wine, 
and their good humor slowly returned.

321
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:20,800
After a comfortable night in the palace, 
Telemachus was woken by Menelaus. 'What is the  

322
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:28,400
purpose of your visit here, Telemachus?' he asked. 
'Is it public business or a private matter?'

323
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,440
'Great king, I came here to ask you for news of 
my father. My mother is surrounded by arrogant  

324
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:45,600
suitors, who spend their days as uninvited guests 
in my house. They will not leave until my mother  

325
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:52,160
chooses one of them, but she delays her choice 
as she is still hoping for my father's return.  

326
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:01,680
So the suitors wait in my hall, eating my meat and 
drinking my wine until I am nearly ruined. I have  

327
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:09,440
come here to ask if you have any information about 
my father. Please, if Odysseus ever proved that  

328
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,840
he was your friend in the hard years of the war, 
tell me everything that you know about his death.'

329
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:24,160
'I cannot believe that those cowardly suitors 
are planning to take brave Odysseus's place in  

330
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:34,880
Ithaca! Ha! They will get a shock if Odysseus ever 
returns - and a quick death too. But to answer  

331
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:43,840
your question, I will tell you everything I heard 
from the god Proteus, whose lips can never lie.  

332
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,680
I was in Egypt. For twenty days my companions and 
I had been on an island in the mouth of the Nile  

333
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:01,120
with no wind to take our ships home. We had no 
more food and were starting to fear for our lives.  

334
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:09,760
But luckily the goddess Eidothee, Proteus's 
daughter, saw us there and felt sorry for us.  

335
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,160
"My father, sea-loving Proteus, lives on 
this island," she said. "He can tell you  

336
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:25,840
how to get home. He can also tell you what has 
happened in Greece while you have been away."

337
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,560
"But how will I make your 
father tell me all this?"  

338
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,600
I asked her. "Proteus does not 
give information willingly."'

339
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:43,600
'"When the sun is high in the sky, Proteus comes 
out of the sea and sleeps on the beach with the  

340
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:51,360
seals. If you and a few companions dress in seal 
skins, you can hide on the beach and surprise him.  

341
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,120
Hold him down with all your strength. He will 
turn into all kinds of shapes as he tries to  

342
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:05,200
escape you. But if this fails, he will 
finally change back to his normal shape.  

343
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,040
Then you can let him go, and he 
will answer all your questions."'

344
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,000
'The next day we did as Eidothee suggested.  

345
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:26,320
At sunrise, she dug holes in the sand. We climbed 
inside and she put seal skins over our bodies.  

346
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,920
There we waited, with the horrible 
smell of dead seals in our noses.  

347
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,680
Soon a great crowd of seals came out of the 
sea and lay down around us on the beach, and  

348
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:47,920
at midday Proteus joined them for a sleep. With 
a shout, we jumped on him and held him tightly.  

349
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:56,480
Immediately he started turning into different 
kinds of animal, then into water and into a tree,  

350
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:04,080
but he could not escape us. Finally he changed 
back into his normal shape, and I said to him,  

351
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,920
"Are you going to change shape all day, 
or will you tell us what we need to know?  

352
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:17,840
We have been unable to leave this island for 
twenty days. What can we do to get home?"'

353
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,840
'"You did not sacrifice to the gods before 
you started your voyage," Proteus said,  

354
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:33,280
"so now they are angry with you. If you want to 
see your home again, you will have to sail the  

355
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:41,920
waters of the Nile once more and make the right 
sacrifices. Then your voyage home can continue."'

356
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,680
'My heart was filled with sadness at the 
thought of returning to the Egyptian mainland.  

357
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,560
But I hid my feelings and 
said, "I will do as you say.  

358
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:02,800
But tell me, what news is there of the rest of the 
Greek army? Has everyone reached home safely?"'

359
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:11,520
'"Why, Menelaus, are you asking me this? I warn 
you, you will cry an ocean of tears when you hear  

360
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:20,720
my answer. Most of the Greek commanders are now 
safe in their homes, but two have died. A third,  

361
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:27,840
though alive, is held prisoner on an unknown 
island, far from his friends and loving family."'

362
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:37,280
'"Ajax was the first to die, in a terrible storm 
at Gyrae. But your brother Agamemnon, who had been  

363
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:45,760
with Ajax just before the storm, was lucky and 
sailed from Gyrae with all his ships unharmed.  

364
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:56,080
It seemed that he had escaped his rate. When 
he landed safely in his homeland, Mycenae,  

365
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:03,040
he kissed the earth in happiness. His arrival, 
though, was watched by one of Aegisthus's spies."'

366
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:10,000
'"While you and your brother were 
at Troy, your cousin Aegisthus had  

367
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,880
turned his attention to wife-stealing. Your 
brother's wife, Clytemnestra, was his prize.  

368
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:25,760
At first she had listened to his words of love 
with deaf ears, but before long she had become his  

369
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:32,640
willing lover. Now Aegisthus was 
waiting for Agamemnon's return."'

370
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,600
He had already won the wife.  

371
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:43,200
Next he was planning to murder the husband and 
rule the great lands of Mycenae in his place.

372
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,840
'"When Aegisthus heard the spy's news, he 
sent soldiers to hide in Agamemnon's palace.  

373
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:59,360
Then he went in his chariot to meet the king. 
Your brother, never guessing Aegisthus's terrible  

374
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:08,720
plans, came up with him from the coast and they 
celebrated his return together. Then Aegisthus  

375
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,880
killed him in his own palace, as a 
man might sacrifice a cow to the gods.  

376
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,400
Agamemnon's companions were murdered too. 
There was not a single man left alive."'

377
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:33,840
'This was Proteus's story, and it broke my 
heart. I sat down on the sands and cried.  

378
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:40,000
After some time, Proteus interrupted 
me, saying, "You have cried long enough!  

379
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:49,280
Waste no more time in tears. Is it not better 
to do everything in your power to reach home,  

380
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,240
so that you can punish Aegisthus for his crime?"'

381
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:01,840
'These words made me feel a little better. "You 
have described the fates of two Greek commanders.  

382
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,080
Who is the third, who is a 
prisoner on an unknown island?  

383
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,360
Please tell me his name, even if 
it brings me more unhappiness."

384
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:21,600
'"The third is Odysseus," he replied. "I saw 
him on the island of the goddess Calypso,  

385
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:27,520
with tears running down his face. His 
only desire is to return to Ithaca,  

386
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,040
but Calypso is in love with him 
and does not want him to leave.  

387
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,720
Without her help, he is a prisoner on the island 
- he has no ship or crew to carry him home."

388
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:49,360
'The old man had nothing more to say. Soon 
he sank back into the deep salt waters,  

389
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:58,080
and I returned with my companions to the ships. 
The next day, we sailed back to the Egyptian  

390
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:06,000
mainland, and there we made the right sacrifices 
to the gods. We also built a great mound of earth,  

391
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,840
so that the name of Agamemnon would 
live in that far land forever.

392
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:21,680
In front of Odysseus's palace, the 
suitors were sitting and joking as usual.

393
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:29,600
Noemon came to Antinous and handsome 
Eurymachus. 'Do you know when Telemachus  

394
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:37,120
is expected home from Pylos? He went in my ship, 
and I need it for a voyage to my farm on Elis.'

395
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:46,080
'Pylos!' cried Antinous. 'I thought he was up in 
the hills of Ithaca with his pigs and his sheep.'

396
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:55,760
'Yes, we all thought that,' agreed Eurymachus. 
'Noemon, tell us exactly what you know.

397
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,800
'He left several days ago, and his 
crew were the best young men on Ithaca,  

398
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:10,320
after ourselves. Mentor went as his captain 
- well, it looked like Mentor on the ship,  

399
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:17,520
but in fact I saw Mentor here on 
Ithaca yesterday. Very strange!'

400
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,760
As Noemon walked away, Antinous and 
Eurymachus called all the suitors together.

401
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,280
'Telemachus is in trouble 
now,' thundered Antinous.  

402
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:38,720
'We said that his voyage to Pylos would 
never happen. And he has already gone,  

403
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:46,960
taking the best men on Ithaca with him! There 
is only one way to answer this arrogance.  

404
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:55,680
Give me a fast ship and a strong crew, and 
I will wait for him in the water between  

405
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:03,840
Ithaca and the Samian rocks. His voyage to 
find his father is going to end in blood.'

406
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,320
The other suitors agreed to this plan, and 
asked Antinous to make all the arrangements.

407
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:20,000
The servant Medon heard their conversation and ran 
to tell his queen. When Penelope heard the news,  

408
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:28,800
her knees shook and her eyes filled with tears. 
'But why has my son gone?' she asked Medon.  

409
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,880
'Does he want his bones to join his 
father's, washed by the salt sea waves?'

410
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,080
'I understand that he was looking 
for news of his father, my lady,'  

411
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,000
replied Medon, leaving the room quietly.

412
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:54,480
Penelope fell to the floor. Her women-servants 
surrounded her as she cried, 'Is there any woman  

413
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:01,520
whose fate is crueler than mine? Zeus gave 
me a good husband, then took him from me.  

414
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:09,840
And now my son has been stolen away without 
a word. And you servants are cruel too.  

415
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:17,680
You all knew of Telemachus's voyage, 
I am sure. Why did no one wake me from  

416
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:23,280
my bed as he went to his ship, so that 
I could stop this foolish adventure?'

417
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:33,200
'Dear lady,' replied old Eurycleia, 'I 
knew all about his voyage, and I even  

418
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:39,280
gave him the food that he needed for it. But 
he made me promise that I would not tell you.  

419
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:48,800
He did not want to upset you unnecessarily. 
Now, go and wash, and put on some fresh clothes.  

420
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:57,040
Then pray to Athene. Although the danger is 
great, the goddess may be able to save him.'

421
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,920
While Penelope prayed to Athene, Antinous 
and his crew prepared their ship.  

422
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:15,520
As the sky grew dark, they left the shore and 
sailed to Asteris, a little island between Ithaca  

423
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:23,840
and the rocky coast of Samos. There they waited 
for Telemachus's ship to come into view.
 
 
 

424
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,120
CHAPTER THREE

425
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,120
Leaving Calypso

426
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,480
''Even well-built ships do 
not cross this endless sea.  

427
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,160
It would be mad to travel such a 
long distance in a home-made raft.'

428
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:49,840
While Athene was helping young Telemachus, 
Zeus sent his messenger Hermes to talk to the  

429
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:57,360
goddess Calypso. For many years, Odysseus had 
been an unwilling guest on Calypso's island.

430
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:06,080
Outside Calypso's cave, Hermes 
stopped to admire the beautiful scene.  

431
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:13,360
A little stream ran between trees filled with 
birdsong, and flowers and fruit grew everywhere.  

432
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:21,680
A fire burned brightly at the cave's entrance, 
and inside he could hear Calypso singing.

433
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,480
When she noticed the god entering her 
home, she said, 'Hermes, you are welcome.  

434
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,840
Come and have something to eat, 
and tell me what brings you here.'

435
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:45,440
'I have been sent here by Zeus,' he replied. 'I 
had no wish to make this long journey - across  

436
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:53,360
endless, empty sea, with no cities or people on 
the way. But no one can refuse the orders of Zeus.  

437
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:01,840
This is Zeus's message: it is not Odysseus's 
fate to end his days on your island,  

438
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:08,480
so send him on his way without delay. 
He must continue his voyage to Ithaca.'

439
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:20,160
Calypso's body shook with sadness. 'Zeus is so 
unfair. He himself is allowed any number of human  

440
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:27,680
girlfriends. But if a goddess finds love with 
a human, he ends her happiness immediately.  

441
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:36,880
I saved Odysseus from death after his ship was 
destroyed in a storm; I welcomed him here on my  

442
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:43,840
island and looked after all his needs; 
I even offered to turn him into a god.  

443
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:55,920
But now Zeus orders me to let him go. Well, 
I must do it - I have no choice. But I have  

444
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,800
no boat to give him, and the voyage is long. 
I can only tell him the direction to take.'

445
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:12,080
'Then send him on his way at once and you 
will not have to worry about Zeus's anger.'  

446
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,800
With these words, Hermes started his 
journey back to the palace of the gods.

447
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:24,320
Calypso went at once to look for Odysseus. 
She found him sitting on the shore,  

448
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:33,520
crying for his lost home as usual. 'Dry your 
tears,' she said to him, 'and waste no more  

449
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:39,840
of your life on this island that brings you 
no pleasure. I am ready to help you leave.  

450
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:47,440
Cut down some trees and make a raft. I will 
give you food and drink for your voyage.  

451
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:56,160
I will even give you a wind that will blow you 
to Ithaca, if more powerful gods do not stop me.'

452
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,280
'Even well-built ships do 
not cross this endless sea,'  

453
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:09,840
he replied. 'It would be mad to travel such 
a long distance in a home-made raft. I will  

454
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:16,320
not do it. Or can you give me your word that 
this is not a trick to cause me more trouble?'

455
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:25,200
Calypso smiled and touched his face with her 
hand. 'How can you think that I would trick you  

456
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:35,840
like that? By the earth and the sky and by death 
itself, I promise you: I am just trying to help.'

457
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:45,600
After they had eaten together in the cave, she 
said, 'So have you definitely decided to leave?  

458
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:53,920
Please think again. I know you miss your wife 
Penelope, but you will have so much pain and  

459
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:01,920
suffering before you reach your homeland. Is it 
not better to stay here with me? A goddess is  

460
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:09,360
more beautiful than any human wife, and with me 
you can escape death forever by becoming a god.'

461
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:17,840
'Do not be angry with me, goddess,' he replied. 
'Of course you are more beautiful than Penelope,  

462
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,720
but I want nothing more than 
to return home to my family.  

463
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,440
And I stopped worrying about the 
dangers of my journey long ago.  

464
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,920
I have suffered so much already. One 
more disaster means nothing to me now.'

465
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:42,320
When morning came, Calypso gave Odysseus 
some tools and he started work on his raft.  

466
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,200
After four days of hard work, the raft was ready.  

467
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:55,440
It had a cloth sail, and plenty of food 
and drink on board. A warm and gentle  

468
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:02,080
wind blew up at Calypso's command, and with 
a happy heart Odysseus sailed out to sea.

469
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:10,160
Keeping his eyes on the stars, he travelled 
east for seventeen days without sleeping,  

470
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,080
and on the eighteenth day the land 
of the Phaeacians came into view.  

471
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:25,040
But Poseidon, god of the sea, saw Odysseus 
on his raft and the sight made him angry.  

472
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,880
'It seems that the other gods have 
changed their minds about Odysseus,'  

473
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:37,120
he said to himself. 'He has nearly 
reached the land of the Phaeacians,  

474
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:45,440
where his suffering is going to end. But I have 
not forgiven him for the harm he did to my son.  

475
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:52,240
It is not too late to send a little 
more trouble in his direction.'

476
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:01,680
With those words, he covered both land and 
sea with thick fog. Then he called all the  

477
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:10,000
winds together to make a violent storm, and 
enormous waves crashed down on Odysseus's raft.

478
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:17,760
'Oh gods!' cried Odysseus, 'have you not 
finished with me yet? Calypso's prophecy  

479
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,840
is coming true - that I will have more pain 
and suffering before I reach my homeland.  

480
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:31,280
How lucky were my companions who were killed at 
Troy! They died with their friends around them,  

481
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:39,520
and their names live forever; I am going to 
die in a sea storm, alone and forgotten.'

482
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,960
As he spoke, a wave the size of a mountain 
thundered down on him and threw him off the raft.  

483
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:58,400
The waters closed over his head. His clothes - 
a gift from Calypso - were heavy in the water,  

484
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:05,760
and made swimming difficult. But at last he 
reached the air and coughed out the salt water  

485
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:13,680
from his mouth. With the last of his energy, he 
swam back to the raft and threw himself on board.  

486
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:21,840
He held on tightly, but the violent winds 
drove him in every direction except to safety.

487
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:31,280
Then Poseidon sent another enormous wave towards 
him. For a second or two, it hung above his head,  

488
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,200
then it crashed violently down on the 
raft, throwing the wood in all directions.  

489
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:47,920
Odysseus held onto a piece of wood, kicked 
off his clothes and bravely started swimming.

490
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:53,680
Poseidon laughed when he saw this. 'It 
is a long way to the coast, Odysseus,  

491
01:02:54,720 --> 01:03:01,840
but swim there if you can. 
I have had my fun with you.'

492
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:10,480
Athene now sent the south, east and west 
winds back to bed. She calmed the north wind  

493
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,840
so it could blow Odysseus gently 
towards the land of the Phaeacians.  

494
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:23,120
For two days and two nights he swam. 
Time after time he thought he would die,  

495
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:30,640
but on the third day, a wave lifted him 
a little and he saw that land was near.

496
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:39,760
He felt like a child who learns that his father, 
after suffering from a long and painful illness,  

497
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:47,280
has been cured. Odysseus felt a similar happiness 
when he saw the welcome sight of hills and trees.  

498
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:54,640
He swam more quickly in his excitement, until he 
heard the thunder of the waves on the rocks ahead.  

499
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:01,840
Too late, he realized that there were no 
beaches to land on, there were only sharp  

500
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:09,760
walls of broken rock. An enormous wave lifted him 
towards them, and it looked like certain death.  

501
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:16,960
But luckily he managed to save himself 
by catching onto a rock with both hands.  

502
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:26,240
The powerful waves soon pulled his hands away, 
and he was back under water. He kicked hard to  

503
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:35,520
reach the air. Finally, he decided to swim further 
along the shore, although he was already so tired.

504
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:45,040
At last Odysseus came to a more welcoming 
coastline. He found the mouth of a stream,  

505
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:55,760
and there he landed safely. He fell to the ground, 
too weak to move. He lay there for some time,  

506
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:04,240
until he realized that it was getting late. With 
no clothes, he might freeze at night if he stayed  

507
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:11,440
where he was. But was he safer in the woods, where 
wild animals might be looking for an easy supper?  

508
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,320
After some thought, he chose 
the warmer ground of the woods,  

509
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:24,640
and looked for a suitable place to sleep. He 
found two trees growing together so tightly  

510
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:31,840
that their branches kept out the wind and sun 
and rain. Between these trees he lay down and  

511
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:39,920
covered himself with a blanket of dry leaves. For 
the first time in three weeks, he fell asleep.

512
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:51,520
As Odysseus slept, Athene went to the 
palace of Alcinous, the Phaeacian king.  

513
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:59,840
Alcinous had a young daughter called 
Nausicaa, as tall and beautiful as a goddess.  

514
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,800
Athene, disguised as one of Nauiscaa's friends,  

515
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:10,560
went into her bedroom and whispered in 
her ear as she slept in her soft bed.  

516
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:20,080
'Nausicaa, why are you being so lazy? You will 
need lots of fine clothes when you are married,  

517
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:28,800
but all your clothes are lying around the palace 
unwashed. Let us go and wash them together in  

518
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:36,960
the morning. We must hurry. The young men from 
every good family in the land want to marry you,  

519
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,600
and your father will certainly 
choose a husband for you soon.'

520
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:51,280
Athene then returned to her home on Mount 
Olympus, and a little later Nausicaa woke up.  

521
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,000
Remembering the strange dream 
that she had had in the night,  

522
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:03,360
she immediately went to find her father. 
'Father, could I have one of the horses today,  

523
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:10,000
and a vehicle to carry our dirty clothes to 
the stream? Your own clothes need washing,  

524
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,720
and my brothers often ask for clean 
clothes to wear at their dances.'  

525
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:22,160
She did not talk about her own marriage - she was 
too shy to discuss this matter with her father.  

526
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:29,680
But he understood completely and replied, 'The 
servants will bring you what you need, my child.'

527
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:38,080
While the servants brought a vehicle and a horse, 
Nausicaa rushed around the palace collecting her  

528
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:45,360
family's finest and most colourful clothes. Her 
mother packed her some food and wine for the trip,  

529
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:52,720
and soon Nausicaa and a group of her friends 
were on their way to the stream, talking happily.

530
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:59,520
There were some deep pools in the 
stream, perfect for washing the clothes.

531
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:07,840
The girls threw them into the water by the armful 
and started their work. When everything was clean,  

532
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,560
they stretched out the clothes on the beach.  

533
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:17,680
Then they bathed in the stream and sat down for 
some food while the sunshine dried the clothes.

534
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,040
When they had finished their meal, 
they started playing a ball game,  

535
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,080
and Nausicaa sang the instructions.  

536
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:35,600
She looked like a young goddess, more beautiful 
than all the beautiful girls around her.

537
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:43,200
The girls' voices woke Odysseus and he got 
out of his bed between the trees to see what  

538
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:51,280
was happening. Luckily, he remembered that he was 
wearing no clothes, and used some leaves to hide  

539
01:08:51,280 --> 01:09:00,400
his body. But he looked dirty and wild after his 
terrible days at sea, like a dangerous animal mad  

540
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:09,520
with hunger. When the girls saw him, they screamed 
and ran away. Only Nausicaa stayed to face him.

541
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:17,280
Odysseus's first thought was to throw his arms 
around the beautiful girl's knees and ask her for  

542
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:24,880
help. But he did not want to upset her by touching 
her. Instead, he kept his distance and said,  

543
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:31,760
'Are you a human or a goddess? I cannot 
guess the answer, since I have never  

544
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:40,480
seen such beauty. If you have a human family, 
how lucky they are! What pleasure they must feel  

545
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:47,840
when you dance in their company. And luckiest of 
all is the man who takes you home as his wife.

546
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,040
'Princess, I must ask you for help.  

547
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:58,640
Yesterday I arrived on this shore, carried here 
by the winds after three weeks on the stormy seas.  

548
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:08,160
My raft and my clothes are lost, and I know no 
one in this land. Pity me in my troubles. Tell me,  

549
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:14,000
please, how do I reach your city? And do you 
have anything that I can use for clothes?'

550
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:25,040
'Sir,' she replied, 'you will be given everything 
that you need. The king of this land is Alcinous,  

551
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:30,480
and I am his daughter. I will gladly 
show you the way to his palace.'

552
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:35,760
'I thank you with all my 
heart,' answered Odysseus.

553
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:44,080
Nausicaa now called to her friends. 'Come 
back, girls. There is nothing to fear.  

554
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:51,280
This man is an unlucky voyager and we will help 
him, since all strangers are protected by Zeus.'

555
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,560
Odysseus washed his salty skin in the stream, 
while the girls looked for some clothes to give  

556
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:06,400
him. As he dressed, clean at last, Athene used 
her powers to make him taller and stronger,  

557
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:13,920
with thicker hair. Nausicaa whispered to 
her friends, 'When I first saw this man,  

558
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:22,000
I thought he was terribly unattractive; now, 
though, he looks more like the gods on Olympus.  

559
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,320
How I would like a man like this as my husband!  

560
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,640
Hurry, now, girls. Take him 
something to eat and drink.'

561
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,880
Odysseus was very grateful for the food.  

562
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:43,680
While he ate hungrily, the girls packed up the 
washed clothes. Then Nausicaa called to Odysseus,  

563
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:50,640
We are going back to the city now. I am sure you 
will understand when I ask you to follow with my  

564
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:58,720
friends only as far as the city gates. Inside the 
city, I must be more careful of my reputation.  

565
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:05,600
You can imagine what people will say if they 
see me with a handsome stranger. They will  

566
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:11,760
guess that I have refused all the men from local 
families and chosen a foreign husband instead,  

567
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:20,720
or that a god has taken me as his wife. That kind 
of talk will not help me to find a good husband  

568
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:28,000
when the time comes. So, we will leave you 
at the entrance to the city. Give us time to  

569
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:36,080
return to the palace, then join us there later. 
In the city, look at no one and ask no questions.  

570
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:43,840
My people are great sailors, thanks to Poseidon, 
with the fastest ships in the world - but they are  

571
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:53,280
not always good hosts. When you enter the palace, 
look for my mother, Queen Arete. She usually sits  

572
01:12:53,280 --> 01:13:00,800
next to my father in the great hall and, as the 
daughter of the last king, she is as powerful and  

573
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:07,760
popular as King Alcinous himself. Throw your 
arms around her knees and ask for her help.  

574
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:14,240
If she feels pity for your situation, 
you will soon see your homeland again.'

575
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,400
Odysseus willingly agreed to the plan.  

576
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:25,120
At the entrance to the city, he waited while the 
princess and her friends returned to the palace.  

577
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:34,880
Athene threw a magic fog over him so that no one 
could see him as he walked through the city. When  

578
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:41,200
he reached the gates of the palace, he was almost 
blinded by the shining sight that met his eyes.  

579
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:50,160
Hanging on silver posts were two great doors of 
gold, and inside were hundreds of beautiful works  

580
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:59,840
of art, also made of gold. Around the palace was a 
brightly coloured garden full of tall fruit trees.

581
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:07,360
Still protected by Athene's magic fog, he 
entered the palace. He found the great hall  

582
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,840
and walked, unseen, past a long 
table of Phaeacians eating dinner.

583
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:21,760
When he got to Queen Arete's seat, he threw his 
arms round her knees and, at the same moment,  

584
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:29,360
Athene lifted the fog from his shoulders. 
Everyone in the room looked at him in shock.
 
 
 

585
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,600
CHAPTER FOUR

586
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,840
With the Phaeacians

587
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,400
'I can think of no better 
companion for my daughter.  

588
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:47,200
I would give you a house and great treasures if 
you were willing to stay here as her husband.'

589
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:57,760
'Arete, great queen,' said Odysseus, 'I am here 
to ask you and your royal husband for help.  

590
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:06,800
I pray that the gods give your family good fortune 
and great happiness. For myself, my dearest  

591
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:12,880
wish is to return to my home across the seas, 
after all the disasters that I have suffered.'

592
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:19,760
No one spoke, and Odysseus sat 
down on the floor by the fire.  

593
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:28,480
At last, the silence was broken by an older 
Phaeacian man named Echeneus. 'My king,  

594
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:36,400
it is not right to let this man sit on the floor. 
Offer him one of our silver chairs to sit on,  

595
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:45,280
and ask the servants to bring him some wine. We 
should pray to Zeus, protector of strangers.'

596
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:52,880
Alcinous did as Echeneus suggested, 
giving Odysseus the seat where his  

597
01:15:52,880 --> 01:16:00,560
favourite son usually sat. When Odysseus 
had had food and drink, Alcinous said,  

598
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:09,120
'Phaeacians, we have eaten well. Now it is time 
for you to return to your homes for the night.  

599
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:15,120
In the morning, we will decide how to arrange 
this stranger's safe return to his homeland.'

600
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:22,880
The Phaeacian guests left the room. 
While the servants cleared the tables,  

601
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:29,440
Arete looked more closely at Odysseus and 
recognised the clothes that he was wearing.  

602
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:38,160
She herself had made them with her ladies' 
help. 'Sir,' she said, 'who are you?  

603
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:45,440
And who gave you those clothes? Did you say 
that you have come here from across the sea?'

604
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:52,720
'Great queen, it would be boring for you to 
listen to all my troubles, as the gods have  

605
01:16:52,720 --> 01:17:00,240
sent me so many. But I will tell you this. 
I have come from an island far out to sea,  

606
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:07,120
the home of the goddess Calypso. Before 
that, I was travelling with my companions,  

607
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:14,880
but they all died when Zeus destroyed 
our ship. Only I managed to stay alive,  

608
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:20,720
by holding onto a piece of the broken ship 
until the winds blew me to Calypso's shore.  

609
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:28,480
For seven years she tried to win my love, and for 
all that time I was an unhappy prisoner on her  

610
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:36,400
island. But, finally, she allowed me to leave. 
I made a raft and sailed safely until I caught  

611
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:44,160
sight of the mountains here in Phaeacian lands. 
But then Poseidon sent a storm to destroy my raft,  

612
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,400
and I nearly lost my life many 
times as I swam to your shore.

613
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:58,320
'I slept near the coast, and in the morning 
I was woken by your daughter and her friends.  

614
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,920
I asked her for help and 
she gave me these clothes.  

615
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:09,040
You should be proud of her. She has the 
beauty of a goddess, and the good sense too.'

616
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:17,360
'She made one mistake,' said Alcinous. 'Why 
did she not bring you home with her friends?'

617
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:26,080
'Do not blame your daughter, great king,' replied 
Odysseus. 'She wanted me to follow her. It was my  

618
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:31,920
decision to stay behind, fearing that you would 
not like a stranger as your daughter's companion.'

619
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:41,040
'My friend, I can think of no better companion for 
my daughter. I would give you a house and great  

620
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:48,240
treasures if you were willing to stay here as her 
husband. But we will not keep you here by force.  

621
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:56,320
Tomorrow you can make your voyage home. It 
will only take a day - it does not matter  

622
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:03,680
how far you are going. You will soon learn why the 
Phaeacians have such a good reputation as seamen.'

623
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:14,240
Odysseus's heart filled with happiness as he heard 
Alcinous's words. Arete showed him to the bed that  

624
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:21,840
the servants had prepared for him, and he spent 
the night dreaming of a happy return to Ithaca.

625
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:30,080
In the morning, fifty-two young men were chosen 
as the crew for the voyage to Odysseus's homeland.  

626
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:36,640
They prepared their boat down at the 
port, then came to the palace for a meal.  

627
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,360
When they had eaten, Alcinous 
called for his bard, Demodocus.

628
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:52,720
'Demodocus, the gods have given you a special 
gift. Your songs never fail to please our ears,  

629
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,360
whatever subject you choose for your story. Sing!'

630
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:05,680
Demodocus sang of the Trojan War, and the 
argument between Odysseus and Achilles that  

631
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:12,480
had started a great wave of disasters for the 
Greeks. As Odysseus listened to the bard's song,  

632
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:19,840
he put his hands over his face and cried. He 
tried to hide his tears from the Phaeacians,  

633
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:28,320
but Alcinous noticed his sadness. Not wishing 
to upset his guest, he stopped Demodocus  

634
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:34,240
after a pause in the song. 'Good people, 
we have enjoyed the food and the song.  

635
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:41,680
Now let us go outside and show our guest 
that the Phaeacians are also good sportsmen.'

636
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,320
Everyone followed Alcinous 
to the city's meeting-place.  

637
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,680
The finest young men in the land 
rushed forward to show their skill.  

638
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:01,280
First there was a running race. A great cloud 
of dust followed the runners around the course.  

639
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:10,480
Euryalus was soon far ahead of the 
rest, and won the race easily. Next  

640
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:18,720
came throwing, jumping and fighting competitions, 
each had a different winner. Alcinous's son  

641
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:25,680
Laodamas, who had won the fighting, then went 
to Odysseus and said, 'Come, sir, and join our  

642
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:32,320
games. Forget your troubles for a few minutes, 
since you will soon be back in your homeland.  

643
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:38,720
If you are good at sport, there is no better 
way to make a famous name for yourself.'

644
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:45,280
Odysseus replied, 'My heart is too 
full of sadness to play in your games.  

645
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:55,920
I have suffered disaster after disaster, and now 
I can think of nothing except my voyage home.'

646
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:03,040
Euryalus, the winner of the running race, 
joined them. 'We understand, sir,' he said.  

647
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:10,080
'We were wrong to think that you might have 
strength or speed. You are more like a sea  

648
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:16,640
captain, worrying about his business and 
his ship. Clearly you are not a sportsman.'

649
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:25,120
Odysseus gave him an angry look. 'You should be 
ashamed of yourself for that insult,' he said  

650
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:32,720
angrily. 'Some men do not have the fortune of good 
looks, but they win popularity with the people for  

651
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:40,240
their fine intelligence and wise words. Others - 
and you are one - are good-looking but arrogant,  

652
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:50,160
with no good sense at all. Your words have 
angered me. I am not unskilled at sport,  

653
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:58,960
as you suggest, but after years at war and on 
the stormy seas I am not as strong as I once was.  

654
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:07,600
I will join your competition, though, if you wish 
it. I will not listen to more of your insults.'

655
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:14,720
Odysseus jumped from his seat and picked 
up a stone disk, much bigger than the ones  

656
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:21,280
that the Phaeacians usually used. Putting all 
his weight into the throw, he sent the disk  

657
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:27,200
flying through the air. It landed far beyond 
the throw that had won the competition earlier.

658
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:37,360
Odysseus turned to the Phaeacians with 
a smile. 'Now beat that if you can,'  

659
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:43,200
he said. 'But I will probably make 
an even longer throw in a minute.  

660
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:49,680
You said that you wanted a competition. 
Well, I am happy to beat you in a fight,  

661
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:58,320
or with a bow and arrow. I am confident that I 
can win at anything except running. I am weak  

662
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:04,800
after my days at sea, and a younger man 
would probably be faster on his legs.'

663
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:10,640
'My friend,' said King Alcinous, 
'I do not blame you for your anger.  

664
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:19,680
Euryalus was wrong to speak to you as he did. 
But let us forget the games. When you are at  

665
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:26,080
home with your wife and children, I want you 
to tell them of our special Phaeacian skills.  

666
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:34,400
We are not the world's greatest fighters 
or throwers, but we can run fast and we are  

667
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:42,560
excellent seamen. We are also very proud 
of the fine food, music and dance at our  

668
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:51,120
dinners, and of our wonderful hot baths and 
comfortable beds. So come, forget the games,  

669
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:59,840
and let our dancers perform for you. And later our 
bard Demodocus can entertain us with his songs.'

670
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:09,520
For the rest of the afternoon, Odysseus watched 
the traditional dances of the Phaeacians  

671
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:16,640
and listened to Demodocus's stories of the 
gods. The entertainment ended with a dance  

672
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:24,560
by two of Alcinous's sons, Laodamas and Halius, 
in which they threw a purple ball to each other  

673
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:30,160
as they moved in time to the music. 'You 
are right to be proud of your dancers,'  

674
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:36,160
Odysseus said to his host. 'I have never 
seen such a wonderful performance.'

675
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:43,040
His words pleased Alcinous. 
'Phaeacians,' said the king,  

676
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:47,760
'we must give our guest 
suitable gifts to take home.  

677
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:56,240
I and the other twelve princes of the land should 
each give him some fine clothes and a bar of gold.  

678
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:04,640
And Euryalus should add his own gift too, 
to apologise for his rudeness at the games.'

679
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:11,600
Everyone agreed with Alcinous's suggestion 
and the gifts were organized at once.  

680
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:19,600
Euryalus gave Odysseus a well-made sword, 
saying, 'Sir, your visit has been a great  

681
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:28,320
pleasure to the Phaeacian people. If my words 
upset you, let the winds blow them away. I pray  

682
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:33,840
to the gods that you have a safe voyage on our 
ship and a warm welcome when you reach your home.'

683
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:41,440
'Friend,' replied Odysseus, 'I thank you, 
and pray that the gods give you a happy life.  

684
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,800
Your words at the games are now forgotten.'

685
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:55,200
Queen Arete packed the new clothes and the gold 
in a chest, and added a gold cup from her husband.  

686
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:02,880
Then the servants poured Odysseus a hot bath - 
and what a pleasure it was to lie in that bath,  

687
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,440
after his hard weeks at sea.

688
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,720
When he was dressed, he 
went back to the great hall.  

689
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:18,080
Nausicaa was standing at the entrance 
to the hall, looking like a goddess.  

690
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:24,640
She was filled with admiration when she saw 
Odysseus. 'Good luck, my friend,' she said.  

691
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:31,840
'Think of me sometimes when you are safely 
back home. You would not be alive without me.'

692
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:41,280
'Princess Nausicaa,' replied Odysseus, 'I pray 
that Zeus will soon let me see my home again.  

693
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,840
If he does, I will always remember you.'

694
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:53,600
With these words, he entered the hall and 
took his seat next to King Alcinous at dinner.  

695
01:27:55,360 --> 01:28:02,080
When he saw Demodocus arrive, he asked a servant 
to take the bard a plate of meat. Demodocus  

696
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:08,480
accepted it with pleasure, and Odysseus said, 
'I have never heard music as beautiful as yours,  

697
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:14,960
Demodocus, and it is wonderful that you know the 
story of the Greeks' actions at Troy so well.  

698
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:22,080
Can you tell us now about another part of the 
war, when the Greeks built their wooden horse?  

699
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:28,640
If you sing of this as it really happened, I 
will tell the world of your God-given skill.'

700
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,760
The bard was happy to take 
this story as his subject.  

701
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:42,240
The wooden horse was, he sang, Odysseus's idea for 
getting Greek soldiers inside the walls of Troy.  

702
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:50,160
An enormous, hollow horse was made and 
Odysseus and some others hid inside.

703
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:56,560
Then the rest of the Greeks burnt their 
defenses and sailed away from the coast,  

704
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:04,080
pretending that they had given up the war. When 
the Trojans saw the horse, they pulled it through  

705
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:11,520
the gates of the city, but they argued about what 
to do next. Some wanted to throw it off a hillside  

706
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:18,400
and break it on the rocks below, but others 
wanted to keep it as a great gift to the gods.  

707
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:28,080
In the end the horse was left untouched. That 
night, Odysseus and his friends climbed out  

708
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:35,200
of the horse and opened the city gates to their 
army outside. Greek soldiers poured through the  

709
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:41,600
gates to destroy the city. They ran through 
the steep streets leaving death behind them,  

710
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:47,440
while Odysseus and Menelaus had the fight of 
their lives against the son of the Trojan king.

711
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:56,640
While the bard was singing, tears ran down 
Odysseus's face. When Alcinous noticed his  

712
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:02,800
guest's condition, he said, 'Phaeacians, 
though Demodocus tells his story beautifully,  

713
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:09,840
it does not please everyone in the room. 
Since we began our meal, our guest has  

714
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:17,040
been crying bitterly. Let us stop the story now, 
so that he can enjoy his last evening with us.  

715
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:24,960
We do not want to upset him. And sir, 
you should tell us now who you are.  

716
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:32,160
Where is your home? Our seamen will need 
to know where to take you. And tell us  

717
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:39,200
about your life and your travels. What places 
have you visited? What sights have you seen?  

718
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:48,000
And explain why our bard's stories of the Trojan 
War cause you so much unhappiness. Did you know  

719
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:54,240
someone who died at Troy? Did you lose a good 
friend, or someone from your family?'
 
 
 

720
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,280
CHAPTER FIVE

721
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,160
A Monster with One Eye

722
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:10,480
'He jumped up, caught two of my 
companions in his great hands,  

723
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:15,840
and knocked their heads against 
the stone floor of the cave.'

724
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:24,480
'King Alcinous,' said Odysseus, 'I do 
not know where to begin and end my story.  

725
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:32,320
The gods have put so many troubles in my 
path! But I shall start by giving you my name.  

726
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:38,960
Though my home is far from here, I want 
you all to think of me as your friend.  

727
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:45,920
I am Odysseus, son of Laertes, 
and my home is on Ithaca.

728
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:53,120
'It is a rocky island, but there is no 
sweeter sight for a man than his own country.  

729
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:58,640
The whole world talks about my 
clever plans during the Trojan War.  

730
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,520
But let me tell you about the 
disastrous voyage that followed.'

731
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:12,320
'From Troy, I sailed with my companions to 
the city of the Cicones, who had fought for  

732
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:18,080
the Trojans in the war. We destroyed the city 
and killed most of the men who lived there.  

733
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:24,640
We shared the women and the treasures from 
the city between us, and then I told my  

734
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:32,000
men to leave. The fools refused. There was 
still a lot of wine and meat in the city,  

735
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:38,720
so they stayed there, filling their 
stomachs. This gave the Cicones time  

736
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:44,000
to get help from other cities in the area, 
whose armies were larger and better trained.  

737
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:51,920
In the morning, they attacked us - as 
many of them as the leaves and flowers in  

738
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:59,360
spring. We held them back at first, but after 
a whole day of fighting they broke our line.  

739
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:08,000
My men and I had to run to our ships in confusion, 
with the enemy at our back. Six men from  

740
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:14,320
each of our twelve ships were killed. The 
rest of us were lucky to escape alive.'

741
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:22,160
'We sailed away as fast as we could, 
crying for our lost companions.  

742
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:28,240
Soon there was more trouble. When we were nearly 
home, the winds carried us in the wrong direction,  

743
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:37,200
past Cythera. For nine days we were chased 
across the waves by those disastrous winds,  

744
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:45,760
and on the tenth day we reached the land of 
the Lotus-eaters. We got out of the ships,  

745
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:52,640
collected fresh water for the next part of our 
voyage, and had a quick meal on the beach. Then  

746
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:58,240
I sent three of my companions to find out 
what sort of people lived in this land.

747
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,481
'The men soon met the Lotus-eaters.  

748
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:10,960
Luckily, they were peaceful people who liked 
to share their lotus fruit with strangers.  

749
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:19,600
There was just one problem - if you ate this 
sweet fruit, you forgot all thoughts of home.  

750
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:25,120
Immediately, my companions had 
no wish to return to the ships  

751
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:32,800
and bring us news. They only wanted to stay with 
the Lotus-eaters and eat lotus fruit all day.  

752
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:40,240
In the end, I had to use force to bring 
them back. Tears ran down their faces  

753
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:45,840
as I tied them onto the ship and ordered 
the other men to continue the voyage home.

754
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:57,280
'Next we came to the land of the Cyclopes. 
They are rough, lawless people, one-eyed and  

755
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:04,880
much taller than normal men. They have no form 
of government, but live with their families  

756
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:10,560
and their sheep in caves in the mountains, 
paying no attention to their neighbours.  

757
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:16,080
They live on good farm land, 
but they do not grow food on it.  

758
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:21,760
They have no ships, either, so 
know nothing of the outside world.

759
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:30,960
'We landed on an island not far from the 
Cyclopes's coast and had a look around. No  

760
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,840
one lived on the island, but there were 
plenty of animals and fruit for food,  

761
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:41,840
and a fresh-water stream. It was a 
perfect place to rest from our voyage.  

762
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:48,560
Some of the men went hunting, and soon 
there was meat cooking on the fires.'

763
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:55,840
'All day we ate, washing down the food with 
red wine that we had taken from the Cicones.  

764
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,920
We looked across the sea to 
the land of the Cyclopes.  

765
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:05,920
We could see the smoke from their fires, and 
could even hear them calling to their sheep.'

766
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:13,200
'The next morning, I called the 
men together. "My friends," I said,  

767
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:19,520
"I am going to take my ship to find out what 
kind of people live in that land over there.  

768
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:24,320
The rest of you, stay here 
and wait for our return."'

769
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:31,440
'My crew sat at their oars and it was not 
long before we had crossed to the mainland.  

770
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:38,880
As we were making the ship safe on the 
beach, we noticed a cave close to the sea.  

771
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:47,680
It had a very tall entrance, and an area outside 
surrounded by a great wall of stones and branches.  

772
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:57,600
I chose my twelve best men to come with me, and 
told the rest of my loyal companions to guard  

773
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:03,120
the ship. I filled a large wineskin 
with the finest wine from the ship.  

774
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,360
It had been a present from one of the Cicones,  

775
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:14,000
a servant of the god Apollo, whose family I 
had protected during our attack on his city.  

776
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:20,640
It was a wonderful drink. The servant 
had kept it secret for many years,  

777
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:30,240
and when he drank it he mixed one cupful of wine 
with twenty cupful's of water. The smell of the  

778
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:38,400
wine was heavenly, and no one could refuse a drink 
of it. I brought this wine with me, and some food,  

779
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:44,160
because I had a strange feeling that the people 
in this land were not going to be welcoming hosts.

780
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:51,600
'It did not take us long to reach 
the cave. Its owner was not at home,  

781
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:58,320
so we went inside and looked around. 
There were enormous baskets of cheese,  

782
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:05,520
wooden buckets full of milk, and sheep 
organized into different age groups - new-born  

783
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:10,720
babies in one area, spring-born in 
another, and summer-born in a third.  

784
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:17,760
My men suggested taking some cheese and 
sheep to the ship and sailing away quickly.  

785
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:25,360
Although this was good advice, I decided instead 
to wait for the owner of the cave to return.  

786
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:29,840
I was hoping for some gifts from our host.

787
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:42,080
'We lit a fire, ate some cheese, and sat down to 
wait. At last, the cave's owner arrived. He was a  

788
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:49,680
great monster, more like a mountain than a man, 
and had one big eye in the middle of his face.  

789
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:58,000
He was carrying an enormous pile of dry wood for 
the fire, which he threw down on the ground inside  

790
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:05,840
the cave with a great crash. We were so frightened 
by the noise that we ran to the back of the cave.  

791
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:13,920
He had been out on the hills with the adult 
sheep. Now he drove some of the sheep into  

792
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:18,560
the cave for milking, and left the 
others in the walled area outside.  

793
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:25,840
Then he closed the entrance with an enormous 
stone, too big for twenty horses to pull.

794
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:30,800
He milked his sheep, then put 
each mother with her young.  

795
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:39,600
He used some of the milk for cheese, and left 
the rest in a bucket to drink with supper. When  

796
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:46,000
he had finished his work, he lit the fire 
again. That was the moment when he saw us.

797
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:56,720
'"Strangers!" he cried. "Who are you? Where are 
you from? And why have you come to these shores?"

798
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:08,640
'The man's monstrous body and deep, 
loud voice filled us with terror,  

799
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:17,920
but I managed to find the words to reply. "We 
are Greeks," I said, "on our way back from Troy.  

800
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:25,840
The winds drove us in the wrong direction - as 
the gods intended, I suppose. We are proud to  

801
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:32,880
say that we fought with great Agamemnon in the 
Trojan War. But now we are asking for your help.  

802
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:39,840
We are hoping that you can welcome us as your 
guests, and perhaps even give us some gifts.  

803
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:46,800
Remember your duty to Zeus, who is the protector 
of travellers in need of a friendly welcome."

804
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:56,720
"'Stranger, you must be a fool, or from 
very far from here, if you think that I  

805
01:40:56,720 --> 01:41:05,120
care about Zeus and the other gods. We 
Cyclopes are much stronger than the gods.  

806
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:14,160
I will only be kind to you and your men if it 
suits me, not out of fear of Zeus's punishments.  

807
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:23,440
But tell me, where did you leave your ship? 
Was it near here, or further along the coast?"

808
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:32,160
'His question was intended to trick me, 
but I am not a fool. I quickly thought  

809
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:37,280
of a story to tell him. "Our ship was 
destroyed in a storm off your coast.  

810
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:45,840
It is in pieces on the rocks north of here. 
Luckily, I and my friends here escaped alive."

811
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:53,680
The cruel monster did not reply. Instead, he 
jumped up, caught two of my companions in his  

812
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:57,840
great hands, and knocked their heads 
against the stone floor of the cave.  

813
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:04,960
He ate their legs first, then their arms, 
then the rest of them, even the bones,  

814
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:15,360
until there was nothing left. We watched in shock, 
praying to Zeus for pity. When the Cyclops had  

815
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:21,280
finished his meal and washed it down with milk, 
he stretched out next to his sheep for a sleep.

816
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:30,240
I felt for my sword, planning to kill him 
as he slept. But then I saw the heavy stone  

817
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:36,080
in the entrance and realized that without his 
strength we could never get out of the cave.  

818
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:42,080
So we waited fearfully for morning.

819
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:50,160
When he woke, the Cyclops lit the fire again and 
milked his sheep. Then he took two more of my  

820
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:57,760
men and ate them greedily. Finally, he pushed the 
stone away from the entrance without difficulty,  

821
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:01,760
drove the adult sheep out of the 
cave, and replaced the stone.  

822
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:09,840
As he went with the sheep to find grass, I 
was left in the cave with murder in my heart.

823
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:22,320
This was my plan. In the cave there was an 
enormous stick. The Cyclops sometimes carried it  

824
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:27,920
when he was out walking, but it was big 
enough to support the sail of a good-sized  

825
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:33,760
ship. I cut off part of this stick 
and gave it a sharp point at the end.  

826
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:40,880
Then my men and I held it over the fire 
to make it hard. When it was ready,  

827
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:48,960
we hid it at the back of the cave. Then I chose 
four men to help me when the Cyclops returned.

828
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:55,760
'Evening finally came, and the 
Cyclops returned with his sheep.  

829
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:00,800
This time he left none of the 
sheep outside in the walled area.  

830
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:08,400
When they were all safely inside the cave with 
him, he closed the entrance with the stone,  

831
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:15,760
did the milking, took another two of my men 
and started eating. Trying to hide my fear,  

832
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:23,120
I went to him with a wooden bowl full of the 
wine that I had brought with me. "Here, Cyclops,  

833
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:30,240
have some wine to wash down your meal. 
There was some very fine wine on our ship.  

834
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:37,920
We brought it to you as a gift, hoping that 
you would help us on our journey home. We  

835
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:44,000
wanted to be your friends, but your treatment of 
us has been more terrible than we ever imagined.  

836
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:51,440
Are you not ashamed of your behavior?" 
The Cyclops laughed and took the wine.  

837
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:56,480
"It tasted so good that he drank 
it quickly and asked for more."

838
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,080
"And while you pour it, tell me your name,"  

839
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:10,240
he said. "I would like to give you a present 
too - something that you will really like.  

840
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:19,200
We Cyclopes have wine, too, but it is 
nothing compared to this drink of yours."

841
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:26,160
'I gave him another bowlful of wine, and 
he drank it even more quickly than before.  

842
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:33,200
Three times I filled the bowl for him, and three 
times the fool drank to the bottom of the bowl.  

843
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:42,880
Finally, when the wine had confused his 
mind, I said, "Cyclops, you asked me my name.  

844
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:53,600
I will tell you, and then you can give me the 
gift that you have promised. My name is Nobody."

845
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:11,840
The cruel monster answered, "And here is my 
gift. Of all these men, I will eat Nobody last."

846
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:23,680
'Soon after he said this, he fell to the ground. 
He did not get up, but lay on his back, laughing,  

847
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:31,600
until he went to sleep. In this alcoholic 
sleep, he was sick. Wine mixed with bits of  

848
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:38,240
my eaten men poured from his mouth. It was hard 
not to be sick ourselves at this terrible sight.  

849
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:46,080
But this was our moment to act. I put the end 
of our stick into the dying fire to make it hot.  

850
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:54,880
Just before the stick started to burn, I pulled 
it out of the fire. Then my companions and I drove  

851
01:46:54,880 --> 01:47:01,680
the sharp point of the stick into the Cyclops's 
eye. With all our force, we held it there,  

852
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:08,720
as his eye smoked and burned. He gave a 
terrible scream, and we moved away in terror.

853
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:14,560
'He pulled the stick from his eye, 
which was pouring blood onto the ground.  

854
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:22,160
Throwing the stick away, he called to the 
other Cyclopes who lived in caves in the area.  

855
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:28,640
Hearing his screams, they came to find out what 
was wrong. From outside the cave, they shouted,  

856
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:35,840
"What is the matter, Polyphemus? Why have 
you woken us all up with those screams and  

857
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:40,720
shouts of yours? Is someone stealing 
your sheep or trying to kill you?"

858
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:51,280
Out of the cave came Polyphemus's reply. 
"My friends, Nobody is trying to kill me."

859
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:56,480
"Well, if no one is attacking 
you and your sheep are safe,  

860
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:04,160
you must be crazy," said his neighbours. 
"Illnesses of the mind are sent by Zeus,  

861
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:11,280
so we can do nothing to help you. You should 
pray to your father, the god Poseidon."

862
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:19,600
'And his neighbours went home, while I laughed 
that my false name had tricked them so easily.  

863
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:28,080
The Cyclops was still crying out in pain. He 
felt around the mouth of the cave with his hands,  

864
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:35,280
hoping to catch us as we tried to escape. 
Did he really think that I was so stupid?  

865
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:42,080
But if we wanted to leave the land of 
the Cyclopes alive, we needed a good  

866
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:50,240
plan. I spent a long time thinking. In 
the end, this is what I decided to do.

867
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:59,840
'The male sheep in the cave were fine animals, 
big and strong with coats of thick black wool.  

868
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:05,600
I quietly tied these sheep together in groups 
of three, putting one of my men under the  

869
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:10,560
middle sheep in each group so that there 
was a sheep on either side to protect him.  

870
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,960
For myself I chose the biggest sheep of all.  

871
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:27,840
I held on to his wool and hung upside-down between 
his legs. We waited like this until morning.

872
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:36,400
When it grew light, the sheep made 
their way to the mouth of the cave.

873
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:44,160
Their master, although still in great pain, 
passed his hands over the backs of all the animals  

874
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:50,160
as they stopped in front of him. The fool never 
thought of looking under the sheep's chests,  

875
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:56,960
where my men were tied. My own sheep 
was the last one to reach the doorway;  

876
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:06,320
he walked more slowly than the others because 
of my heavy weight. As Polyphemus felt his back,  

877
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:12,240
he said, "Dear sheep, why are 
you the last to leave today?  

878
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:20,720
Usually you lead your companions proudly to the 
best grass and the clearest water in the stream,  

879
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:28,800
and return first in the evening to the 
cave. But today you are last of all.  

880
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:37,840
You must be sad about your master's eye. 
How cruel was the man who did this to me!  

881
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:46,480
Nobody was his name, and I will find a 
way to punish him. He is not safe yet.  

882
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:57,840
Ah, if you had a voice, you could tell me where 
to look for him. I would break open his head  

883
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:03,040
on the floor of the cave to pay him back 
for the pain that he has caused me!"

884
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:09,200
With these words, he let the sheep 
pass through the mouth of the cave.

885
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:16,320
When we were a safe distance from the 
Cyclops, I came out from under my sheep  

886
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:23,280
and untied my companions. Then we quickly 
drove the sheep down towards our ship.  

887
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:30,640
The men at the ship were very happy to see us, 
but their smiles soon disappeared when they heard  

888
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:38,080
of the terrible fate of our lost companions. 
Their loud crying was putting us all in danger,  

889
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:43,840
so I made them get the sheep onto the 
ship as quickly and quietly as possible.  

890
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:48,880
Then the crew sat at their oars 
and took the ship out to sea.

891
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:58,960
Before we were too far from Polyphemus, I 
shouted, "Cyclops! Your strength could not  

892
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:05,760
protect you from the resourceful Greeks. This 
is your punishment for eating your guests."

893
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:14,000
My words made the Cyclops so angry that he pulled 
a great rock from the mountainside and threw it at  

894
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:21,520
us. It fell just in front of our ship, causing 
a wave that sent us back towards the shore.  

895
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:26,560
With a long stick, I pushed us back out to sea,  

896
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:31,280
and the crew pulled hard on their 
oars to save us from disaster.  

897
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:41,200
When I started to shout at the Cyclops 
again, my men tried to stop me. "Why do  

898
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:47,120
you want to anger this monster?" they asked. 
"He nearly killed us with that last rock.  

899
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,240
The next one will certainly be the end of us."

900
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:58,800
'But I was too full of emotion to listen to 
their advice. "Cyclops!" I shouted again,  

901
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:06,880
"you should know the name of the man who 
blinded you. If anyone asks you, tell them  

902
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:14,640
that it was Odysseus, destroyer of cities, son 
of Laertes, who lives on the island of Ithaca."

903
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:23,760
'The Cyclops cried sadly, 
"So the prophecy was true!  

904
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:32,080
Long ago I was warned that a man called 
Odysseus would rob me of my sight. But  

905
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:41,120
I had always expected a powerful man, someone 
bigger and stronger than me. And here you are,  

906
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:52,640
a weak little man who confused my mind with wine 
and destroyed my eye. But come here, Odysseus,  

907
01:53:53,280 --> 01:54:01,520
so that I can give you some gifts and ask Poseidon 
to protect you on your voyage home. Poseidon is my  

908
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:10,240
father, so he will listen to my request. He will 
give me back my sight, too, if that is my fate."

909
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:18,640
I shouted in reply, "You are a fool, 
Cyclops. Poseidon will never mend your eye."

910
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:27,040
The Cyclops held up his hands to the 
sky and prayed to his father. "Poseidon,  

911
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:35,840
hear your son's request. Stop Odysseus, son 
of Laertes, from reaching his home in Ithaca.  

912
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:44,160
That is my dearest wish. But if you cannot do 
this, at least give him a terrible journey.  

913
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:52,880
Kill his companions, destroy his ships, 
and cause trouble in his palace at home."

914
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:57,440
The sea-god Poseidon was listening.

915
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:06,400
Again, the Cyclops picked up a great rock - 
an even bigger one than before - and threw  

916
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:12,160
it with all his strength at our ship. This 
time, though, we were further from the shore;  

917
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:17,840
the rock fell behind us and its 
wave swept us forward to safety.

918
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:24,080
At last, we reached the island where the 
rest of the men were waiting for our return.  

919
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:28,560
We shared the sheep equally 
between the twelve ships,  

920
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:34,080
but the men gave me the sheep that had 
carried me out of Polyphemus's cave.  

921
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:41,920
I sacrificed this fine animal to the great 
god Zeus. But Zeus was not interested in  

922
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:49,520
the sacrifice. He was already busy planning 
the death of all my loyal companions.'
 
 
 

923
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:56,640
CHAPTER SIX

924
01:55:58,480 --> 01:55:59,840
Circe

925
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:08,080
'They had taken the shape of pigs. Their minds 
were still human, but they could not speak;  

926
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:13,840
only pig noises came from their mouths.'

927
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:20,400
We sailed towards home, thinking sadly of 
the dead friends that we were leaving behind.  

928
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:30,400
Next we came to the island of Aeolia, the 
home of Aeolus and his twelve children - six  

929
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:36,160
daughters and six fine sons. Each son 
is married to one of the daughters,  

930
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:42,480
and they spend all their days with their parents, 
eating wonderful food from dishes of gold.

931
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:50,640
'For a whole month Aeolus entertained us. 
He wanted to know all about the war in Troy,  

932
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:56,880
the Greek army, and our return home. 
I told him everything that I could.  

933
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:05,680
I soon learnt that Zeus had given Aeolus control 
of the winds. He offered to help us on our journey  

934
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:12,880
by giving me a leather bag in which all the strong 
and stormy winds were kept prisoner. He put this  

935
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:20,880
bag carefully in my ship and tied it up tightly 
so that the winds had no chance of escape. Then  

936
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:27,520
he sent us on our way with a gentle wind from the 
west, which blew our ships safely towards home.

937
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:38,080
For nine days we sailed east. I guided the ship 
home myself, without a minute's rest. Then,  

938
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:46,800
finally, our homeland came into view. We could 
even see people working outside their houses.  

939
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:53,520
At last I felt that I could 
relax, and fell into a deep sleep.  

940
01:57:55,600 --> 01:58:03,600
While I slept, my crew started talking about the 
bag from Aeolus. "There must be a fortune in gold  

941
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:12,560
and silver in that bag," they said. "Odysseus 
is so greedy. He is going home rich, but we,  

942
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:18,400
who have travelled the same distances and lived 
through the same dangers, are returning with  

943
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:25,760
nothing. It is just not fair! Let us see 
how much treasure he has got in that bag."

944
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:34,880
Without stopping to think, they untied the 
bag. Immediately the winds rushed out and  

945
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:40,320
a violent storm blew up. Our twelve 
ships were carried back out to sea,  

946
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:48,080
far away from our homes on Ithaca. The 
men were all crying when I woke up.  

947
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:53,600
When I realized what had happened, I nearly 
threw myself into the sea to end my life.  

948
01:58:55,200 --> 01:59:01,840
But I stayed on the ship, and we were 
all driven back to the island of Aeolus.

949
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:11,600
After a quick rest on the beach, I went with 
two companions to Aeolus's palace. When he  

950
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:18,000
saw us outside his hall, he cried, "Odysseus? 
What unlucky fate has brought you here again?"

951
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:25,920
'Sadly, I answered, "The stupidity 
of my crew and my own need for sleep  

952
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:33,440
have brought me back. Please, help me again. I am 
sure that this time my voyage will be successful."

953
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:41,680
'He was silent. Finally, he shouted, 
"Get off this island at once!  

954
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:46,800
It is not right for me to help a 
man who is so hated by the gods.  

955
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:54,160
Your arrival here proves that you have 
no friends on Mount Olympus. Leave now!"

956
01:59:55,760 --> 02:00:04,720
His words upset me deeply, but I left the palace 
as he ordered and returned to the ships. We  

957
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:11,840
sailed for home again, but with none of the good 
humor that went with us on our earlier voyage.

958
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:20,640
After six days at sea, we reached 
the land of the Laestrygonians.  

959
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:28,720
There we found a great curve of beach circled by 
high walls of rock, with only a narrow entrance.  

960
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:37,840
The captains of the other ships sailed straight 
in and landed on the shore. I did not follow them.  

961
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:46,640
Instead, I tied my own ship to a rock just 
outside the entrance. We all climbed up the  

962
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:54,080
steep rocks to find out what kind of land we 
had come to. We saw no farms and no people,  

963
02:00:55,360 --> 02:01:00,960
but there was some smoke in the distance. I sent 
three of my men in the direction of the smoke.

964
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:06,960
They followed a path for some 
time, until they saw a big,  

965
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:10,160
strong girl carrying buckets of water into a town.  

966
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:17,440
When they asked her about her country's king, she 
pointed to the high roof of her father's home.  

967
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:25,920
She was the daughter of King Antiphates. The 
men entered the king's palace and met his wife,  

968
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:32,800
a woman as tall as a mountain. They stood 
still in terror as she called her husband  

969
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:40,000
from the city's meeting-place. When the enormous 
Antiphates arrived, he immediately caught one of  

970
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:49,840
my companions in his hands and ate him. The other 
two ran away, and managed to reach the ships.

971
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:56,000
But Antiphates was soon at the coast 
with an army of monstrous Laestrygonians.  

972
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:03,840
Standing high above the beach, they threw 
rocks down at the ships and men on the shore.  

973
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:14,640
When the ships were all broken, they picked up 
the men one by one and ate them. The cries of the  

974
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:22,400
dying men were terrible, but I could do nothing to 
help them. My ship was beyond the entrance to the  

975
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:29,600
beach, safe from the monsters. My crew, fearing 
for their lives, pulled hard on their oars,  

976
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:37,360
and we were soon in the safety of the open sea. 
But that was the end of all the other ships.

977
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:46,000
My crew and I travelled across the sea to 
the island of Aeaea. There we lay on the  

978
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:52,800
beach for two days, not eating or drinking, 
but thinking sadly about our lost companions.  

979
02:02:54,240 --> 02:03:00,000
On the morning of the third day, I 
climbed a hill to look at the island.  

980
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:06,080
There was just one house, in the middle of 
a forest. I decided not to go there at once.  

981
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:14,320
Instead, I went hunting and returned 
to my men with some fresh meat.

982
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:20,320
"My friends," I said to them, "disaster 
has followed disaster recently,  

983
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:28,880
but we are still alive. Get up and eat. 
There is no point in dying from hunger."

984
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:37,120
They did as I advised, and when night came, they 
were feeling a little stronger and more hopeful.  

985
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:45,040
The next morning, I called a meeting. "I 
will not lie to you, friends," I began.  

986
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:52,960
"We are completely lost. With all these clouds in 
the sky, we do not even know which way is east.  

987
02:03:54,240 --> 02:04:02,160
We must make a sensible plan, but I do not 
know what to suggest. We are on an island,  

988
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:10,320
and there is a house in the middle of a forest. 
There is nothing else that I can tell you."

989
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:16,560
At this news, the men lost all hope. 
They thought of the Laestrygonians  

990
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:23,840
and refused to visit any more strangers. 
But we had to find help from somewhere.

991
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:32,800
In the end, I put the men into two groups. We 
said goodbye to each other with tears in our eyes,  

992
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:39,840
fearing that we would never meet 
again. My group stayed by the ships  

993
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:44,240
and Eurylochus led the 
other group into the forest.  

994
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:53,360
Between the trees, they soon found a house built 
of stone. Dangerous animals surrounded the house,  

995
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:58,880
but instead of attacking the men, they greeted 
them as a friendly dog greets its master.  

996
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:07,120
The men stopped, confused 
by this unusual behavior.

997
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:11,600
'They could hear a woman singing inside the house.  

998
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:20,560
After a whispered discussion, the men decided to 
call out to her. She came quickly. She said that  

999
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:27,680
her name was Circe, and she invited them in. In 
their innocence, they followed her into the house.  

1000
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:32,320
Only Eurylochus sensed the 
danger and stayed outside.  

1001
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:40,160
Circe gave the rest of the men a wonderful meal. 
But she had added a magic drug to their drink.  

1002
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:48,000
When the men finished, they saw that they 
had taken the shape of pigs. Their minds  

1003
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:54,320
were still human, but they could not speak, 
only pig noises came from their mouths.  

1004
02:05:56,160 --> 02:05:58,960
Circe took a stick and drove them outside.  

1005
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:05,280
There they sat in the mud, eating 
the pig food that she threw to them.

1006
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:15,680
After waiting near the house for several hours, 
Eurylochus ran back to the ship. In tears,  

1007
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:21,440
he told us that none of his companions had 
reappeared after they had entered Circe's house.  

1008
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:29,520
I picked up my sword and asked him to lead 
the way back there. He went down on his knees,  

1009
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:36,480
crying, "No, Odysseus, please! Do not make 
me go with you. You cannot help the others,  

1010
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:44,240
and you will not return yourself. It is better 
to sail away quickly with the men that are left."

1011
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:50,320
"Dry your tears, Eurylochus," I 
replied. "You can stay by the ship.  

1012
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:57,840
But I must go - I have no choice."

1013
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:05,280
I walked into the forest alone. I was 
near Circe's house when I met Hermes,  

1014
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:13,200
the messenger of the gods. He took my hand 
and said, "Where are you going now, Odysseus?  

1015
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:21,760
Are you planning to free your friends from Circe's 
magic? Be careful! She has turned them into pigs.  

1016
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:29,760
You are likely to suffer the same fate and never 
see your homeland again. But I can help you.  

1017
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:34,720
This flower is a drug that will 
protect you from Circe's magic.  

1018
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:41,600
Eat it now, and when she hits you with 
her stick, attack her with your sword.  

1019
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:48,960
She will be very frightened and will immediately 
ask to be your friend. You should agree.  

1020
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,840
But first make her promise not 
to trick you or drug you again."

1021
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:07,120
I ate the white flower that he gave me. Then I 
continued along the path to Circe's house. I stood  

1022
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:15,680
outside and called. Circe heard me and invited 
me in. She gave me some of her magic drink,  

1023
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:24,080
but because of Hermes's drug, it had no effect 
on me. She hit me with her stick and shouted,  

1024
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:32,880
"Go and join your pig friends in the mud!" 
At that moment, I attacked her with my sword.

1025
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:42,240
She went down on her knees, screaming and crying, 
and said, "Who are you and where are you from?  

1026
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:50,320
You are the only man who has ever had that 
magic drink and not suffered any ill effects.  

1027
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:57,120
You must be Odysseus. Hermes has often warned 
me to expect you on your way back from Troy.  

1028
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:02,320
But we should not be enemies. Let us be friends."

1029
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:10,560
"Circe," I replied, "how can we be friends 
when you have turned my companions into pigs?  

1030
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:17,840
I will only agree if you promise 
not to trick me or drug me again."

1031
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:22,080
She promised, and so we went back inside.  

1032
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:29,280
She gave me a bath, dressed me in 
new clothes and offered me more food.

1033
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:35,440
When she saw that I was not eating, 
she asked me what the matter was.  

1034
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:42,080
"How can I eat," I replied, "when 
I do not know if my men are safe?  

1035
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:49,520
There will be no pleasure for me in food and 
drink until I see my loyal companions again."

1036
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:56,560
Circe went outside at once, and 
came back with some smelly pigs  

1037
02:09:56,560 --> 02:10:01,440
covered in mud. She put a special 
cream on the head of each one,  

1038
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:09,200
and they magically turned into men again, but 
younger, taller and more handsome than before.  

1039
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:17,120
We all cried tears of happiness. It was 
wonderful to see everyone safe and well.

1040
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:26,080
Circe now told me to fetch the rest of my 
men from the seashore. When they saw me,  

1041
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:32,000
they greeted me with great excitement. They 
had been sure that I would never return.  

1042
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:39,040
We pulled the ship onto dry land and hid 
our treasure and equipment in a cave.  

1043
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:44,080
The men were in a hurry to see 
their friends at Circe s house,  

1044
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:50,240
but Eurylochus stopped them. "Where are 
you going now, you fools?" he said to them.  

1045
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:59,040
"Have you learned nothing from the past few weeks? 
Odysseus leads us from one disaster to another.  

1046
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:06,560
It is because of his thoughtless love of adventure 
that our companions died in the Cyclops's cave."

1047
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:14,640
When I heard Eurylochus's words, I nearly 
cut his head from his body with my sword.  

1048
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:21,360
But my men held me back. "Let 
Eurylochus stay here with the ship,"  

1049
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:26,240
they said. "The rest of us want 
to go with you to meet Circe."

1050
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:33,840
In the end, Eurylochus came too. He 
did not want to stay alone by the ship.  

1051
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:40,880
So together we walked back to Circes house 
and found our companions having baths.  

1052
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:49,600
Everyone greeted each other with tears in their 
eyes. Then Circe ordered her servants to prepare  

1053
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:56,400
a meal, and we celebrated our first evening 
at Circe's house in very good humor.'
 
 
 

1054
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:00,240
CHAPTER SEVEN

1055
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:03,200
Teiresias's Prophecy

1056
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:10,080
If you leave his cows unharmed, 
you will arrive safely in Ithaca.

1057
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:16,400
But if you hurt those cows, your 
ship and your men will be destroyed.'

1058
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:24,400
Circe was a very welcoming hostess, and 
we stayed with her for a whole year.  

1059
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:28,960
But as the months passed and the 
long days of summer returned,  

1060
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:35,360
my companions became anxious that I had 
forgotten my home in Ithaca. "Why are we  

1061
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:42,480
still here on Circe's island?" they asked me 
one day. "It is time to continue our voyage."

1062
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:50,400
That night I spoke to Circe. I told 
her about my companions' complaints,  

1063
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:53,440
and she agreed to help us with our voyage.  

1064
02:12:54,800 --> 02:13:02,400
"But first," she said, "you must visit the 
Underworld and talk to blind old Teiresias.  

1065
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:09,440
Although he is dead, his prophecies are 
as true as they were during his lifetime."

1066
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:17,120
This news broke my heart. I nearly chose 
to end my life there in Circe's house  

1067
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:20,720
to escape the awful journey 
to the world of the dead.  

1068
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:29,840
But finally I asked her, "How can I find the 
way? No one has ever sailed a ship into Hell."

1069
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:35,840
"Do not worry. The north wind 
will blow you to the right place.  

1070
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:44,160
At the edge of the world, you will see a place 
where tall trees grow. Land your ship there  

1071
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:48,000
and the ghosts of the 
Underworld will come to you."

1072
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,360
She told me what to do and say when I reached that  

1073
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:59,440
terrible place. She promised that Teiresias 
would tell me the route of my journey home.

1074
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:04,880
Waking everyone up in the morning, 
I shouted, "Hurry, my friends,  

1075
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:07,840
and say goodbye to your comfortable beds.  

1076
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:14,400
It is time to go. Circe has given us 
instructions for the next part of our journey."

1077
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:22,080
My brave companions were happy to make their 
way back to the ship. But even this time I  

1078
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:29,440
did not lead everyone away safely. Elpenor was 
the youngest in our group, and not very clever.  

1079
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:37,520
The night before, after too much wine, he had 
decided to sleep on the roof because the air  

1080
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:44,240
was fresher there. Woken in the morning by the 
noise of our departure, he jumped up suddenly  

1081
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:54,000
and fell off the roof. The fall broke his neck. 
When we went to help him, we found him dead.

1082
02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:00,880
By the ship, I told the men that our voyage 
would not take us straight home. When they  

1083
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:07,440
heard that our destination was the world of 
the dead, they were filled with terror. But  

1084
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:11,520
they could say nothing to change the 
fate that the gods had chosen for us.

1085
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:19,680
Circe gave us a good wind to fill our 
sails and, a day after leaving Aeaea,  

1086
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:27,120
we reached a dark land at the edge of the world. 
There we found the place that Circe had described,  

1087
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:34,960
where tall trees grow. I landed the ship and 
started to follow Circe's instructions for calling  

1088
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:43,840
the dead. I dug a hole in the ground, the size of 
a man's arm. Into this hole I poured milk, water  

1089
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:51,680
and sweet wine. I prayed to the dead and 
sacrificed two fine sheep from my ship.  

1090
02:15:52,960 --> 02:16:00,480
As their blood poured into the hole, ghosts 
started to come up from the earth - young girls,  

1091
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:05,120
old men, and soldiers killed in war.  

1092
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:13,680
They were making a strange noise, and cold 
fear ran through me. I guarded the hole with  

1093
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:20,400
my sword held tightly. I did not want any 
ghosts to get to the blood before Teiresias.

1094
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:26,480
Suddenly, I recognised the ghost of Elpenor.  

1095
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:34,240
In our hurry to leave Circe's island, we had not 
burnt his body or built a mound of earth for him.  

1096
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:42,399
I called out, "Elpenor! You have reached here more 
quickly on foot than we did in our fast ship."

1097
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:53,680
"Yes, master, but you rushed away from Aeaea too 
fast. Please, when you return, remember my body.  

1098
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:59,840
Burn it on the beach with my sword, and 
build a mound of earth in my memory.  

1099
02:17:00,479 --> 02:17:05,200
At the top, plant the oar that I used 
on the ship with my dear companions."

1100
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:10,560
"I will do all that you ask, 
dear Elpenor," I replied.

1101
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:14,479
Teiresias was not far behind him.

1102
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:24,960
"Odysseus, son of Laertes, why have 
you left the sunlight to visit the dead  

1103
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:31,760
in this sad, dark place? If you want 
a prophecy, step away from the blood.  

1104
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:42,240
I will tell you your future after I have drunk."

1105
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:50,719
I let him drink the blood, and he soon 
said, "My lord Odysseus, you want an  

1106
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:57,760
easy route home. But Poseidon is angry 
about your cruel treatment of his son,  

1107
02:17:58,319 --> 02:18:09,759
the Cyclops, and he is going to make your journey 
hard. You and your men will finally reach home,  

1108
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:16,720
though, if you can control your hunger 
when you come to the island of Thrinacie.  

1109
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:27,280
There you will find the fat cows of the Sun 
god, who can see everything on his daily  

1110
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:37,840
journey across the sky. If you leave his cows 
unharmed, you will arrive safely in Ithaca.  

1111
02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:49,280
But if you hurt those cows, your ship and 
your men will be destroyed. You yourself  

1112
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:58,559
will return home on a foreign ship and find 
your family in terrible trouble. You will find  

1113
02:18:58,560 --> 02:19:05,840
arrogant suitors in your palace, eating your 
food and demanding marriage with your wife.  

1114
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:14,240
You will kill the suitors for their crimes. 
But then you must start another journey.  

1115
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:23,439
Take an oar and travel until you find a 
place where the people know nothing about  

1116
02:19:23,439 --> 02:19:32,879
the sea and ships and the use of salt in their 
food. You will meet a man who calls your oar  

1117
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:42,960
a farm tool. That will be your sign. Plant 
your oar in the earth and sacrifice a sheep,  

1118
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:54,880
a cow and a pig to the great god Poseidon. After 
this, you can go home. You will have a long life,  

1119
02:19:55,439 --> 02:20:02,319
and you will die peacefully of old 
age, far from the terrors of the sea."

1120
02:20:04,399 --> 02:20:16,947
"So this is the fate that the gods have chosen 
for me," I said. "Thank you, Teiresias."

1121
02:20:16,947 --> 02:20:24,240
As Teiresias went back to the Underworld, the 
ghost of my mother, Anticleia, came towards  

1122
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:33,120
me. I was deeply upset to see her there. She had 
been alive when I left Ithaca for the war in Troy.  

1123
02:20:34,080 --> 02:20:43,840
"Mother, tell me what happened to you," I cried. 
"What death brought you to this terrible place?"

1124
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:52,400
"It was sadness that killed me, Odysseus, my 
child. I missed your wise and gentle ways,  

1125
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:58,880
and life gave me no pleasure. In 
death, I have escaped that pain."

1126
02:21:00,319 --> 02:21:02,399
I tried to put my arms around her,  

1127
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:07,679
but there was nothing to hold. My 
arms went straight through her.

1128
02:21:08,399 --> 02:21:15,040
"You cannot touch me, Odysseus. When life 
leaves the body, we become no more than a dream.  

1129
02:21:16,399 --> 02:21:22,879
But go now, return to the world of 
the sun, and find your way back home."

1130
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:25,840
"But what can you tell me about home,"  

1131
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:32,400
I asked her. "How is the rest of 
the family? Are they safe and well?"

1132
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:40,720
"Penelope and Telemachus are still living in your 
palace, trying to keep your lands safe from the  

1133
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:48,800
greedy suitors. But your father Laertes lives 
a sad and lonely life, alone on his fruit farm.  

1134
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:56,479
He never goes down to the city now. In winter 
he sleeps on the floor by his fire, without a  

1135
02:21:56,479 --> 02:22:03,759
bed or a blanket to keep him warm. In summer, he 
sleeps under the fruit trees in a bed of leaves.  

1136
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:10,000
As old age presses down on him, he 
thinks of nothing except your return."

1137
02:22:12,319 --> 02:22:19,040
Soon Persephone, Queen of the Underworld, drove 
away my mother and the other women ghosts who  

1138
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:29,920
were with her. In shock, I saw another ghost that 
I recognised - Agamemnon. He drank the dark blood  

1139
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:36,720
and stretched out his hand towards me. But all 
the strength had left the body that had been  

1140
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:43,680
so powerful, and he could not reach me. He and 
I looked at each other with tears in our eyes.  

1141
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:50,399
Finally, I said, "Great king, what 
terrible fate has brought you here?  

1142
02:22:51,439 --> 02:22:57,280
Were you killed in a storm on your way home 
from Troy, or in a fight on enemy lands?"

1143
02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:08,640
"No, my friend," Agamemnon replied. "I was 
murdered when I reached my homeland by my cousin  

1144
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:19,520
Aegisthus. Aegisthus welcomed me to my palace, 
then killed me like a sheep for a sacrifice.  

1145
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:26,399
My companions were cut down too, and 
the floor of the hall swam with blood.  

1146
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:35,360
You saw the deaths of many fine men at Troy, 
Odysseus, but none were as pitiful as ours.

1147
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:43,760
"And, worst of all, my wife 
Clytaemnestra was there watching.  

1148
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:52,480
When I was dying, with a sword in my chest, 
she turned away coldly and joined her lover,  

1149
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:59,840
Aegisthus. She did not even close 
my eyes or mouth for me in death."

1150
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:07,360
"Poor man!" I cried. "Zeus has 
been a cruel enemy to your family,  

1151
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:11,040
using the tricks of women 
to destroy your happiness.  

1152
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:19,679
Your brother s wife Helen caused the Trojan 
War, and now your own wife has sent you here."

1153
02:24:20,479 --> 02:24:31,359
"Yes," replied Agamemnon. "Never tell a woman 
all your secrets, Odysseus, not even your wife,  

1154
02:24:32,479 --> 02:24:41,839
because one day she may turn against you. When 
you reach home, do not sail openly into port.  

1155
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:50,560
Hide your return until you are sure that you are 
safe. But you are luckier than I was, my friend.  

1156
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:57,440
Your own wife, Penelope, has a 
loyal heart and a wise head."

1157
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:02,160
I said a sad goodbye to Agamemnon.  

1158
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:09,840
I had learned what I needed to in this 
terrible place. It was time to leave.

1159
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:21,920
I called to my men to get the ship ready, and soon 
we were on our way. With a good wind in our sails,  

1160
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:27,040
we quickly reached Aeaea, the 
island of beautiful Circe.  

1161
02:25:28,479 --> 02:25:36,240
We found Elpenors body and took it to the 
highest place on the coast. There we built a fire  

1162
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:42,080
and placed his body on it. We watched 
sadly as the flames surrounded him.  

1163
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:47,840
When the fire was dead, we covered 
the place with a mound of earth  

1164
02:25:48,479 --> 02:25:56,240
and planted Elpenor's oar on top. I prayed that 
his death would be the last on our journey home.

1165
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:05,840
Circe had noticed our return, and came now with 
her servants, carrying bread, meat and wine.  

1166
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:11,440
We had a good meal on the beach, in 
preparation for our voyage the next day.  

1167
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:20,960
When it grew dark, my men went to sleep by 
the ship, but Circe held me back. She wanted  

1168
02:26:20,960 --> 02:26:29,520
to warn me about the dangers of the voyage ahead. 
"Listen to my advice, Odysseus, and hopefully you  

1169
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:39,120
will remember it when you need it most. You will 
soon meet the Sirens. They sit on their island,  

1170
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:47,200
singing to the sailors who pass. They ask people 
to come closer, and their voices are so beautiful  

1171
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:56,639
that the sailors cannot refuse. But be careful. 
Piles of dead bodies lie all around that island.  

1172
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:06,640
Its rocks destroy any ship that goes near. 
But it is possible to sail past safely.  

1173
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:14,080
Put wax in the ears of your crew, so that 
they cannot hear the Sirens' magical song.  

1174
02:27:15,359 --> 02:27:21,599
If you wish to hear it yourself, your 
men must tie you tightly to the ship.  

1175
02:27:22,880 --> 02:27:31,040
They must not free you until the danger 
has passed. When the Sirens are behind you,  

1176
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:38,560
you will have to choose between two routes. 
One takes you to the Moving Rocks, which crash  

1177
02:27:38,560 --> 02:27:45,840
together whenever a ship sails between them. Even 
the birds cannot fly through this place safely,  

1178
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:55,120
but lose a wing or a tail when the rocks squeeze 
tight. For sailors, there is no hope of escape.  

1179
02:27:57,200 --> 02:28:04,559
In the other direction lie two rocks. One 
is so tall and steep that no one could climb  

1180
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:12,320
to the top of it. Half way up there is a 
cave, and this is the home of the monster  

1181
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:23,120
Scylla. She is a terrible sight, with twelve 
feet and six long necks, each ending in a head  

1182
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:30,479
full of teeth as sharp as knives. She lies 
in her cave, stretching her long necks down  

1183
02:28:30,479 --> 02:28:38,319
to the sea in search of seals and fish to eat. 
No crew has ever passed her without losing men.  

1184
02:28:39,359 --> 02:28:47,200
She always catches a sailor in each of her 
six mouths. The other rock is not as high,  

1185
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:52,000
and is only a short distance across 
the water from Scylla's cave.  

1186
02:28:53,439 --> 02:29:01,120
A fruit tree grows from the rock, and below it 
the awful Charybdis pulls down the dark water to  

1187
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:08,640
the sea floor. Three times a day she pulls it 
down, and three times she throws it up again.  

1188
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:16,399
I pray that the gods keep you away from her, 
because not even the sea-god Poseidon could  

1189
02:29:16,399 --> 02:29:24,639
save your ship from her violent seas. 
No, you must stay close to Scylla's rock  

1190
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:32,800
and sail past as quickly as you can. It is better 
to lose six of your men than your whole crew."

1191
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:40,320
"Yes," I replied. "But is there really no way 
to protect all my men from these two monsters?"

1192
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:47,281
"Are you still looking for trouble, 
Odysseus, after all that you have suffered?  

1193
02:29:48,479 --> 02:29:54,959
Scylla is a monster of great power. 
She cannot die. You will waste time  

1194
02:29:54,960 --> 02:30:02,080
if you try to fight her. Then she will be 
able to take even more of your men. No,  

1195
02:30:03,439 --> 02:30:10,160
you must accept your fate. Sacrifice six 
of your men and the rest will be safe."

1196
02:30:12,399 --> 02:30:20,799
As she finished speaking, the sun came up. I said 
goodbye to Circe and went back to my companions.  

1197
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:29,280
We untied the ship and were soon on 
our way. We made good progress as the  

1198
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:34,800
men pulled on their oars. It was time 
to prepare them for the danger ahead.

1199
02:30:38,960 --> 02:30:46,480
"My friends, Circe has given me advice for the 
rest of our journey. I must share it with you.  

1200
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:54,560
First, we will come to the island of the Sirens. 
I will protect your ears from the magic of the  

1201
02:30:54,560 --> 02:31:03,840
Sirens' song. But one of us should listen. Tie me 
very tightly to the ship so that I cannot escape.  

1202
02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:11,040
If I complain, tie me more tightly. 
Do not take the ship near the island,  

1203
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:18,240
even if I command it a hundred times. The 
rocks destroy all ships that go near."

1204
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:24,000
I took some wax and made it warm in my hands.  

1205
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:30,319
Then I pushed a little into everyone's 
ears, so that they could hear nothing.  

1206
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:39,040
When this was done, the men tied my hands and 
feet to the ship, and we were ready to continue.

1207
02:31:41,359 --> 02:31:48,080
The Sirens' island soon came into view. 
We saw three strange women on the island,  

1208
02:31:48,080 --> 02:31:55,840
with beautiful human faces but the bodies 
of birds. They started their magical song,  

1209
02:31:56,479 --> 02:32:03,200
and it was the most beautiful music in the 
world. I was filled with desire to hear more.  

1210
02:32:04,960 --> 02:32:12,880
When they asked me to come to them, I wanted to 
with all my heart. I ordered my men to untie me,  

1211
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:20,560
but of course they could not hear. I tried 
to break free, but they tied me more tightly.  

1212
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:26,720
Sadly, I watched the men take me further 
and further from the Sirens' island.  

1213
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:37,840
Finally, they untied me and took out the wax 
from their ears. With Circe's help, we were safe.

1214
02:32:38,399 --> 02:32:41,200
But there was no time to 
discuss what had happened.  

1215
02:32:42,160 --> 02:32:47,040
We saw rough water ahead, and heard 
the thunder of waves against rocks.  

1216
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:53,760
The crew were so frightened that the oars fell 
from their hands. I walked around the ship,  

1217
02:32:53,760 --> 02:33:01,360
saying, "We have met trouble before, my friends. 
With my help, you escaped the Cyclops's cave.  

1218
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:08,719
Today you must follow my orders again. We are 
going to go as close as possible to the higher  

1219
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:16,241
rock, keeping the ship away from the rough water. 
Stay at your oars and pull as hard as you can."

1220
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:25,439
The crew obeyed. I did not tell them about Scylla, 
because fear of the monster would stop them from  

1221
02:33:25,439 --> 02:33:32,160
pulling on their oars. I stood at the front of 
the ship, hoping to get the first view of those  

1222
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:40,240
six long necks. I looked until my eyes 
grew tired, but I could see nothing.

1223
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:47,840
Then, suddenly, Charybdis threw up 
the water from the deep sea floor.  

1224
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:55,200
Salt water fell down on us like rain, and 
the top of the sea was like boiling water.

1225
02:33:56,319 --> 02:34:01,840
Then she pulled the water down again, and we 
could see the sand at the bottom of the sea.

1226
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:09,759
My men were pale with fear. Then, while 
everyone was looking at Charybdis,  

1227
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:16,560
Scylla stretched her necks down from her cave 
and caught six of my strongest men in her mouths.  

1228
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:24,880
Their arms and legs waved pitifully in the air 
as they called for help. But we could do nothing  

1229
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:32,400
to save them. In seconds, the monster had carried 
them up to her cave and started her terrible meal.

1230
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:42,640
We continued sadly on our way, and soon we saw 
the lovely island of Thrinacie. As we came near  

1231
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:50,880
the beach, we could heard the sound of cows. 
I remembered the words of Teiresias and said,  

1232
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:58,160
"Listen carefully, my friends. In the Underworld, 
Teiresias warned me about this island. There is  

1233
02:34:58,160 --> 02:35:06,240
a greater danger here than any that we have met 
before. Sail past the island. We should not land."

1234
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:15,520
My men were very upset. Eurylochus 
shouted, "Do you never get tired, Odysseus?  

1235
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:21,600
How can you tell us not to land here, 
after everything that has happened today?  

1236
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:30,879
You must be made of iron! It is nearly sunset, 
and we are tired and hungry. If we continue past  

1237
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:37,040
this island, we will be at sea all night 
- there is no other land near here.  

1238
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:45,840
And storms are always worse at night. Do you 
really want the winds to destroy our ship? You are  

1239
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:53,840
crazy. We should land here and cook our supper. 
In the morning, we can go back to the open sea."

1240
02:35:55,439 --> 02:36:00,719
The rest of the crew agreed with him, 
and I realized that the gods had already  

1241
02:36:00,720 --> 02:36:10,320
decided our fate. "I am one against many, 
Eurylochus. I cannot refuse your demands.  

1242
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:17,040
But I ask every one of you to promise that 
you will not harm the animals on the island.  

1243
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:22,000
Sit peacefully and eat the 
food that Circe has given us.  

1244
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:28,080
If you eat anything else, I cannot 
save you from a disastrous end."

1245
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:39,359
When everyone on the ship had given me their 
promise, we landed on the Sun-god's island. We ate  

1246
02:36:39,359 --> 02:36:45,439
a good supper, but the conversation kept returning 
to the men that Scylla had taken from us.  

1247
02:36:47,200 --> 02:36:53,840
During the night, a storm blew up, and 
in the morning it was not safe to sail.  

1248
02:36:55,520 --> 02:37:00,960
I called my companions to a meeting and said, 
"We still have plenty of food on the ship.  

1249
02:37:01,920 --> 02:37:09,279
Keep your hands off the cows on this island, or 
disaster will follow. They belong to the Sun-god,  

1250
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:13,280
who can see everything on his 
daily journey across the sky."

1251
02:37:15,439 --> 02:37:23,679
The men agreed willingly. But the storm 
did not stop. For a whole month it blew,  

1252
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:33,040
and we were unable to leave the island. While our 
bread and wine lasted, the men obeyed my orders.  

1253
02:37:34,240 --> 02:37:41,120
When there was nothing more to eat, they went 
fishing and caught birds from the trees, but they  

1254
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:48,399
were still hungry. I hoped that one of the gods 
would take pity on us and show me a way to escape.  

1255
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:53,200
I found a quiet place, out of the wind, to pray.  

1256
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:59,840
But when I had finished, the 
gods sent me into a deep sleep.

1257
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:10,319
While I slept, Eurylochus was causing trouble down 
by the ship. "No death is pleasant," he argued,  

1258
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:16,560
"but a death from hunger is the 
worst. I say we should eat those cows.  

1259
02:38:17,439 --> 02:38:23,120
We can sacrifice them to the gods, and promise 
to give all our treasure to the Sun god  

1260
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:29,599
when we return to Ithaca. If he is still 
angry with us, let him destroy our ship.  

1261
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:35,520
A quick death at sea is easier than a 
slow and painful one on this island."

1262
02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:43,520
The rest of the crew agreed to his plan. Quickly, 
they brought the cows together and sacrificed them  

1263
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:51,201
to the gods. They had no wine to pour over the 
meat as it cooked, so they used seawater instead.

1264
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:59,359
As I woke from my sleep, I smelled 
the meat cooking on the fire. "So  

1265
02:38:59,359 --> 02:39:06,639
the gods have decided to ruin me," I 
cried. "There is no hope for us now!"

1266
02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:12,880
High in the sky, the Sun god 
had seen my companions' crime.  

1267
02:39:14,080 --> 02:39:21,040
He went to Zeus in anger, saying, "Odysseus 
and his followers have killed my fine cows.  

1268
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:28,319
You must punish them, as they deserve. 
If you leave their actions unpunished,  

1269
02:39:28,319 --> 02:39:34,080
I will disappear from the sky and 
shine on the dead in the Underworld."

1270
02:39:35,439 --> 02:39:42,240
"Shine on us here on Olympus and 
on the world of men," Zeus replied.  

1271
02:39:42,960 --> 02:39:45,840
"You can be sure that I 
will punish the criminals."

1272
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:49,760
This was their conversation on Olympus.  

1273
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:55,359
Calypso heard about it from Hermes 
and later reported it to me.

1274
02:39:57,520 --> 02:40:02,800
Down on the Sun god's island, the men were 
frightened. They could already see the  

1275
02:40:02,800 --> 02:40:08,800
signs of the gods' anger. The skins of the dead 
animals were moving magically around the beach,  

1276
02:40:09,439 --> 02:40:13,279
and the pieces of meat on the fire were 
calling out to each other like cows.  

1277
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:22,000
But we could do nothing to change the situation. 
The cows were dead. The damage had been done.

1278
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:29,680
For six days, the men ate the meat of 
the Sun-god's cows. On the seventh,  

1279
02:40:30,319 --> 02:40:37,920
the wind dropped and it was safe to sail. With 
fear in our hearts, we took our ship out to sea.  

1280
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:45,760
Almost immediately, a cloud formed above the 
ship, making a dark shadow on the sea around us.  

1281
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:54,080
Then came the wind. With the force of a wild 
animal, it attacked us. It pulled the sail from  

1282
02:40:54,080 --> 02:41:00,800
the ship in seconds. Wood came crashing down onto 
the sailors below and one man was knocked into  

1283
02:41:00,800 --> 02:41:09,440
the sea. Worse followed, as Zeus struck the ship 
with lightning. The whole ship shook violently.  

1284
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:16,240
The men held on tightly, but one by 
one they were thrown from the ship.  

1285
02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:21,599
They were pulled this way and that in the water 
until they went down under the waves forever.

1286
02:41:24,479 --> 02:41:32,000
I alone was left on board. But soon the strength 
of the enormous waves broke the ship into pieces.  

1287
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:41,279
Luckily, I managed to climb onto a broken piece 
of wood, and I held on tightly. All night I was  

1288
02:41:41,279 --> 02:41:48,559
blown around by the wind. At sunrise I saw that 
I had been driven back to the rocks of Scylla  

1289
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:56,880
and Charybdis. Charybdis was beginning to pull the 
waters down and I was swept towards a great hole  

1290
02:41:56,880 --> 02:42:03,440
in the sea. Just in time, I managed to catch 
a branch of the tree that grew from the rock.  

1291
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:12,319
I could not get my feet onto the tree, 
but I hung by my arms, hour after hour.  

1292
02:42:12,319 --> 02:42:18,160
Finally, my wait was over. Charybdis threw 
up the wood that had saved me from the storm.  

1293
02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:27,040
I let myself fall back into the sea, swam 
to the wood and climbed back on. Luckily,  

1294
02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:32,479
Scylla did not see me, because there was 
nothing to protect me from her greedy mouths.

1295
02:42:34,640 --> 02:42:40,479
'I was at sea for another nine days, until the 
waves carried me to the shores of Calypso's  

1296
02:42:40,479 --> 02:42:48,799
island. She was kind to me and gave me a 
home. But I have already told you about  

1297
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:57,600
my life with Calypso, good Phaeacians. I 
have reached the end of my story.'
 
 
 

1298
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:02,640
CHAPTER EIGHT

1299
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:04,560
Coming Home

1300
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:11,520
'Look around you, Odysseus. Do 
you not recognise this beach,  

1301
02:43:12,560 --> 02:43:16,081
those rocks, and that tree on the hills above?'

1302
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:25,040
When Odysseus had finished, the hall was 
silent until Alcinous said, 'Odysseus,  

1303
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:33,040
you have suffered greatly. But I am sure that 
you will reach home safely now, with our help.'

1304
02:43:34,399 --> 02:43:41,359
Then he spoke to his Phaeacian guests. 'Friends,' 
he said, 'we have already given our guests fine  

1305
02:43:41,359 --> 02:43:49,839
gifts, but does this man not deserve more after 
all his troubles? Go now and bring him some more  

1306
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:56,240
treasure from your home. Later we will ask 
the common people to pay for these gifts;  

1307
02:43:57,279 --> 02:44:00,479
we do not want any man's generosity to ruin him.'

1308
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:08,400
The next day the Phaeacians came to the 
port with their gifts of gold and silver,  

1309
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:13,120
and Alcinous himself helped to 
put the gifts safely on the ship.  

1310
02:44:14,880 --> 02:44:18,720
Then they all returned to the 
palace for more food and music,  

1311
02:44:19,359 --> 02:44:26,799
as the voyage was not going to start until 
sunset. All day Odysseus kept looking at the sun.  

1312
02:44:28,240 --> 02:44:35,599
He was like a farmer who has worked hard in the 
fields all day; sunset is a welcome sight to a  

1313
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:42,560
man with tired legs and an empty stomach - it 
is the time to stop work and go home for supper.  

1314
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:50,880
In the same way, Odysseus welcomed sunset that 
day. As soon as the sun had sunk below the sea,  

1315
02:44:50,880 --> 02:45:00,560
he said, 'Alcinous, great king, let me say 
goodbye. You have given me the two things  

1316
02:45:00,560 --> 02:45:08,720
that I most wanted - valuable gifts and a crew 
to take me home. I pray that the gods bring  

1317
02:45:08,720 --> 02:45:14,640
you and your family all the happiness that you 
deserve, and keep your people safe from harm.'

1318
02:45:17,359 --> 02:45:23,920
Odysseus and the Phaeacians walked down to the 
port, and the servants carried bread and wine for  

1319
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:32,640
the voyage. On the ship, a blanket was spread out 
for Odysseus to sleep on. Then, after praying to  

1320
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:40,161
the gods, Odysseus climbed on board. He lay down 
on the blanket and the crew sat at their oars.  

1321
02:45:41,279 --> 02:45:47,279
As the ship left the port, Odysseus immediately 
fell into a deep and peaceful sleep.

1322
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:53,040
And now, like a team of four 
horses in a chariot race,  

1323
02:45:53,600 --> 02:46:00,720
the ship raced through the water towards Ithaca. 
After a journey of magical speed, it arrived  

1324
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:07,760
on the coast of Ithaca just before sunrise. The 
crew found a beach with a large cave beside it.  

1325
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:17,600
There the Phaeacian oarsmen landed the ship and 
lifted Odysseus, still asleep, onto the sand. They  

1326
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:23,840
took all his gifts from the ship and piled them 
next to him. Then they started their voyage home.

1327
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:35,359
Athene threw a fog over the island of Ithaca, so 
that no one noticed Odysseus before she could warn  

1328
02:46:35,359 --> 02:46:43,040
him of the dangers in his palace. As a result, 
when Odysseus woke up he did not recognise his  

1329
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:50,720
homeland. He jumped to his feet and cried, 'Oh 
no! Whose country have I come to this time?  

1330
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:59,279
Will they be kind hosts, or dangerous monsters? 
Where can I keep my treasure safe? And what were  

1331
02:46:59,279 --> 02:47:06,240
those dishonest Phaeacians thinking? They promised 
that they would take me home to Ithaca, but  

1332
02:47:06,240 --> 02:47:13,200
instead they have left me in this strange place. 
Let Zeus punish them for breaking their promise.  

1333
02:47:14,399 --> 02:47:20,000
I should look at my treasure too, to 
check that they have not stolen anything.'

1334
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:26,240
He checked his gifts carefully, 
but none were missing. Just then,  

1335
02:47:27,040 --> 02:47:34,080
Athene came to him, disguised as a good-looking 
young farmworker. Odysseus was very  

1336
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:37,600
happy to see that the people of the 
island were not monsters, and said,  

1337
02:47:38,399 --> 02:47:43,279
'Good morning, friend. You are the first 
person that I have met in this land.  

1338
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:51,280
Please help me. I need to find a safe place for 
my treasure. And I need to know where I am.'

1339
02:47:52,800 --> 02:48:00,160
'I am surprised that you do not know this land. 
It is famous in countries far west and far east of  

1340
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:09,279
here. It is rocky - not a good place for horses 
- but it has good farmland and produces fine  

1341
02:48:09,279 --> 02:48:16,399
sheep and cows. Yes, even far away in 
Troy they know the name of Ithaca.'

1342
02:48:18,319 --> 02:48:21,439
Odysseus's heart filled with happiness  

1343
02:48:21,439 --> 02:48:27,279
when he heard that lovely name, but just 
in time he remembered to be careful.

1344
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:36,720
'Of course,' he replied, 'even in Crete we have 
heard of Ithaca. Crete has been my home until now.  

1345
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:42,400
But the king's son tried to take from 
me all the treasure that I won at Troy.  

1346
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:49,600
It was very unfair. I had 
only one choice - to kill him.  

1347
02:48:50,560 --> 02:48:57,840
But when he was dead, I could not live safely in 
Crete. So I took the first ship that I could find.  

1348
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:06,240
We were aiming for Pylos, but the wind was too 
strong and we were driven here instead. Last  

1349
02:49:06,240 --> 02:49:13,439
night we slept on this beach. When I woke in 
the morning, the ship and its crew had gone.'

1350
02:49:14,960 --> 02:49:20,319
Athene smiled at Odysseus's story, 
then changed into her true form.  

1351
02:49:21,840 --> 02:49:26,080
Odysseus stared in wonder at the 
beautiful goddess in front of him.  

1352
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:35,760
'So even in your homeland you have not given up 
your tricks, Odysseus! You and I are so similar.  

1353
02:49:36,560 --> 02:49:43,439
You are the cleverest and most resourceful person 
in the world of men, and I am the cleverest  

1354
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:47,599
and most resourceful of the 
gods. But, though you are clever,  

1355
02:49:48,240 --> 02:49:55,599
you did not realize that the goddess Athene 
was beside you through all your adventures. I  

1356
02:49:56,160 --> 02:50:01,760
made the Phaeacians look after you 
kindly. And now I will help you again.'

1357
02:50:03,680 --> 02:50:09,920
'It is hard to recognise you in all your 
disguises, great goddess,' Odysseus replied.  

1358
02:50:10,960 --> 02:50:17,040
'I remember your kindness at Troy, but have 
I really had much help from you since then?  

1359
02:50:18,399 --> 02:50:23,120
Where were you when the Greek ships were 
separated because of arguments and storms?  

1360
02:50:24,399 --> 02:50:27,200
Where were you when my 
companions were lost at sea?'

1361
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:32,959
'You must understand that I 
could not act against Poseidon,  

1362
02:50:32,960 --> 02:50:37,120
who was very angry about your 
treatment of his son, the Cyclops.'

1363
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:42,160
'But tell me, goddess, and I 
pray that you answer me honestly:  

1364
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:49,840
is this really Ithaca, or were your words 
intended to make me suffer even more?'

1365
02:50:50,960 --> 02:50:55,439
'Look around you, Odysseus. Do 
you not recognise this beach,  

1366
02:50:56,080 --> 02:50:59,359
those rocks, and that tree on the hills above?'

1367
02:51:00,880 --> 02:51:05,600
As she spoke, she lifted the fog 
that was hiding the land from view.  

1368
02:51:06,880 --> 02:51:12,880
Odysseus recognised it at last. He threw 
himself down on the ground and kissed the sand.

1369
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:19,200
'Come,' said the goddess. 'We must hide 
your treasure in that cave over there.'  

1370
02:51:20,880 --> 02:51:26,400
When everything was safely in the cave, Athene 
warned him about the situation in the palace.  

1371
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:33,680
'Penelope is surrounded by suitors. They are 
arrogant and greedy men, who will do anything.  

1372
02:51:34,640 --> 02:51:41,359
They are even trying to murder your son 
Telemachus. When it is time to fight them, I will  

1373
02:51:41,359 --> 02:51:48,479
be at your side,' she said. 'But at the moment 
they must not know about your return. I will  

1374
02:51:48,479 --> 02:51:54,959
disguise you as a man so old and poorly dressed 
that even your wife will not recognise you.  

1375
02:51:56,640 --> 02:52:02,560
Go and stay with Eumaeus, the pig farmer. 
He is still loyal to you and Penelope,  

1376
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:10,240
and he loves Telemachus like a son. He can 
give you the news from the town. And I will  

1377
02:52:10,240 --> 02:52:15,599
bring Telemachus home from Sparta, where he 
has been asking Menelaus for news of you.'

1378
02:52:17,279 --> 02:52:24,880
Athene used her magic to change Odysseus into a 
weak old man. His skin hung loose on his body,  

1379
02:52:25,439 --> 02:52:29,759
his hair was white, and his 
clothes were dirty pieces of cloth.  

1380
02:52:31,359 --> 02:52:36,559
Then she disappeared suddenly, 
hurrying to Telemachus in Sparta.

1381
02:52:40,080 --> 02:52:44,319
Odysseus followed a path up to 
the hills and the home of Eumaeus,  

1382
02:52:44,319 --> 02:52:48,399
the pig farmer, the most loyal 
of all Odysseus's farmworkers.  

1383
02:52:50,160 --> 02:52:56,559
He found Eumaeus near his hut, busy with his 
pigs. There were eight hundred on his farm,  

1384
02:52:57,120 --> 02:53:01,519
although their number was reduced every 
day by the enormous meals at the palace.

1385
02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:10,559
The guard dogs saw Odysseus first and ran 
towards him. Luckily, Eumaeus called them  

1386
02:53:10,560 --> 02:53:17,280
back before they attacked the stranger. 'Those 
dogs almost pulled you to pieces, old man,'  

1387
02:53:18,080 --> 02:53:24,319
he said. 'Then I would have even more 
worries. The situation is bad enough now.  

1388
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:32,960
I spend my days making my master's pigs fat 
so that other men can eat them. But my good,  

1389
02:53:32,960 --> 02:53:39,040
kind master is probably dying of hunger, lost 
in a foreign land, or perhaps already dead.  

1390
02:53:40,160 --> 02:53:45,680
But come inside. When you have had some food 
and wine, you can tell me about yourself.'

1391
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:53,200
Inside the hut, Eumaeus offered his guest a 
seat on a pile of sticks with a sheepskin thrown  

1392
02:53:53,200 --> 02:54:02,240
over it. 'Thank you for this warm welcome,' said 
Odysseus. 'I hope that the gods are kind to you.'

1393
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:08,560
Eumaeus prepared some simple food 
and gave it to Odysseus, saying,  

1394
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:15,600
'It is not much, I am afraid. But we have 
little left after we have sent all our best  

1395
02:54:15,600 --> 02:54:22,560
pigs to those arrogant men in the palace. 
They want to marry my absent master's wife,  

1396
02:54:22,560 --> 02:54:29,201
but they do not behave like future husbands. 
Instead, they sit around the palace all day.  

1397
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:37,520
They kill several pigs every night and drink my 
master's wine like water. They must know that my  

1398
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:42,400
master will never return, because they fear 
no punishment for their unlawful behavior.'

1399
02:54:44,560 --> 02:54:49,840
Odysseus ate the food gratefully, thinking 
about what he would do to those suitors.  

1400
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:57,600
When he had finished, he asked, 
'So who is your absent master?  

1401
02:54:58,399 --> 02:55:04,319
You seem to have a very good opinion of 
him. Perhaps I have met him on my travels.'

1402
02:55:05,520 --> 02:55:13,840
'His name is Odysseus. It was Odysseus, I should 
say, because he is now lying dead somewhere.  

1403
02:55:15,040 --> 02:55:23,279
He was the kindest of masters and the best of men. 
He owned land here on Ithaca and on the mainland.  

1404
02:55:24,399 --> 02:55:31,519
He was rich in pigs and cows and sheep, and in 
treasure too. But the suitors are destroying  

1405
02:55:31,520 --> 02:55:39,121
his property day by day, and soon there will be 
nothing left. My heart aches when I think of it.  

1406
02:55:40,800 --> 02:55:45,600
But tell me, stranger, who you are. 
What has brought you to this island?'

1407
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:50,319
Odysseus told him that he 
had been a prince of Crete.  

1408
02:55:51,439 --> 02:55:58,160
He had had an argument with his brother and had to 
leave his homeland. After many years of travel and  

1409
02:55:58,160 --> 02:56:04,080
a lot of bad luck, he now owned nothing in the 
world except the clothes that he was wearing.  

1410
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:12,160
'I met Odysseus once,' he added. 'He stayed 
at our palace in Crete on the way to Troy.  

1411
02:56:13,680 --> 02:56:21,280
And a few days ago I heard talk of him 
again. There was a ship in Thesprotia  

1412
02:56:21,920 --> 02:56:27,760
waiting to carry him home. The crew were 
expecting to start their voyage this week.'

1413
02:56:28,319 --> 02:56:35,200
'I am sorry for all your troubles, old man,' 
the pig farmer replied. 'But I cannot believe  

1414
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:43,200
your story about Odysseus. Why are you telling 
such lies? Another man told me a similar story  

1415
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:48,080
last year, and travellers regularly 
upset Penelope with false information.  

1416
02:56:49,200 --> 02:56:54,559
Odysseus never arrives, and only 
a fool now believes that he will.'

1417
02:56:56,479 --> 02:57:03,679
'If my story proves false, you can throw me from 
the highest rock on this island,' said Odysseus.

1418
02:57:04,960 --> 02:57:09,120
'Zeus would soon punish a man who 
invited a stranger into his home  

1419
02:57:09,120 --> 02:57:12,720
and then killed him for lying,' replied Eumaeus.

1420
02:57:14,319 --> 02:57:18,160
They spent the evening in friendly 
conversation in front of the fire.  

1421
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:25,280
When it was time for sleep, Eumaeus lent 
Odysseus a thick coat to use as a blanket.  

1422
02:57:26,560 --> 02:57:31,760
Then, always careful of his master's 
property, he went out to sleep with  

1423
02:57:31,760 --> 02:57:36,320
the pigs, to protect them from thieves 
and wild animals during the night.
 
 
 

1424
02:57:40,240 --> 02:57:41,040
CHAPTER NINE

1425
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:43,520
Telemachus Returns

1426
02:57:44,960 --> 02:57:47,680
'I am not a god,' replied Odysseus.  

1427
02:57:48,640 --> 02:57:53,600
'But I am your father, who has been 
the cause of so many problems for you.'

1428
02:57:56,160 --> 02:58:03,840
Athene now went to Sparta and found Telemachus 
and Peisistratus in the palace of King Menelaus.  

1429
02:58:04,399 --> 02:58:08,559
Peisistratus was asleep, but 
Telemachus was lying awake,  

1430
02:58:09,200 --> 02:58:12,720
worrying about his absent father 
and the problem of the suitors.

1431
02:58:14,399 --> 02:58:21,759
Athene stood near him and said, 'Go back to your 
palace and keep it safe from the greedy suitors.  

1432
02:58:22,960 --> 02:58:28,560
Your mother's father has told her to marry 
Eurymachus, since he is the richest of her  

1433
02:58:28,560 --> 02:58:36,880
suitors. If you do not go home soon, you will 
return to an empty house. But be careful.  

1434
02:58:37,920 --> 02:58:43,439
The suitors have sent a ship to attack you 
on your voyage home. They are waiting for  

1435
02:58:43,439 --> 02:58:49,839
you between Ithaca and the coast of Samos, with 
swords in their hands and murder in their hearts.  

1436
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:57,519
Make sure that you go home a different way, 
and sail at night so that they cannot see  

1437
02:58:57,520 --> 02:59:04,800
your ship. Get off the ship at a quiet part of 
the coast and go straight to Eumaeus's pig farm,  

1438
02:59:05,600 --> 02:59:09,760
while your crew sail to the port 
and spread the news of your return.'

1439
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:20,080
When she had delivered her message, she went back 
to Mount Olympus. Telemachus woke Peisistratus  

1440
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:27,920
with a gentle kick and said, 'Come, my friend, 
we must get the chariot ready and be on our way.'

1441
02:59:27,920 --> 02:59:34,160
'We should leave soon, I agree, Telemachus. 
But it is the middle of the night.  

1442
02:59:34,880 --> 02:59:41,359
We cannot drive in complete darkness, and what 
would Menelaus think if we rushed away like  

1443
02:59:41,359 --> 02:59:49,279
thieves in the night? Can our journey not 
wait until morning?' Telemachus agreed to  

1444
02:59:49,279 --> 02:59:56,399
stay in Sparta for a few more hours. When 
daylight came, he went to speak to his host.  

1445
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:05,040
'Menelaus,' he said, 'I must go home. But 
I will never forget your kindness to me.'

1446
03:00:06,479 --> 03:00:12,240
'I will not keep you here against your 
wishes,' replied the king. 'But give me  

1447
03:00:12,240 --> 03:00:18,160
time to bring you some gifts. And enjoy 
one last meal with us before you leave.'  

1448
03:00:19,840 --> 03:00:24,480
Menelaus gave him the bowl of fine silver 
that he had promised him the day before.  

1449
03:00:25,520 --> 03:00:32,640
Queen Helen added a present of her own. 'I 
made this dress myself,' she told Telemachus.  

1450
03:00:33,600 --> 03:00:38,080
'It is for your future wife 
to wear on your wedding day.'

1451
03:00:38,080 --> 03:00:41,600
They then had some food, and after the meal  

1452
03:00:41,600 --> 03:00:45,201
Telemachus and Peisistratus 
climbed into their chariot.

1453
03:00:46,560 --> 03:00:52,800
'Goodbye, young friends,' said Menelaus. 
'Give my good wishes to Nestor.'

1454
03:00:54,080 --> 03:00:59,680
'We will,' replied Telemachus. 'I 
only hope that one day I can give  

1455
03:00:59,680 --> 03:01:06,319
your good wishes to my father too, 
and tell him of your kindness to me.'

1456
03:01:06,319 --> 03:01:13,279
As he spoke, an eagle flew across the sky, 
carrying a chicken from a local farm in its feet.  

1457
03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:19,200
Some farmworkers were chasing 
the eagle, but it gave a cry  

1458
03:01:19,200 --> 03:01:21,760
and flew out to sea, far beyond their reach.

1459
03:01:22,960 --> 03:01:30,560
'This was a sign from the gods,' said Helen. 
'And its message seems clear. Just as the eagle  

1460
03:01:30,560 --> 03:01:35,680
attacked the chicken, Odysseus will attack 
the suitors when he finds his way home.  

1461
03:01:36,560 --> 03:01:40,480
Or perhaps he is already in 
Ithaca, planning their death.'

1462
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:45,120
'I pray that you are right,' said Telemachus.  

1463
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:49,360
And with a shout to the 
horses, he started the chariot.

1464
03:01:51,920 --> 03:01:55,680
After a smooth journey, they 
reached Pylos the next day.  

1465
03:01:57,040 --> 03:02:03,200
Telemachus said goodbye to Peisistratus at the 
port. 'I am sorry that I cannot say goodbye  

1466
03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:09,599
to your father too. But I have no time to go 
to the palace. I need to get home urgently.'

1467
03:02:11,600 --> 03:02:17,840
As the crew carried the gifts from Menelaus 
onto the ship, a stranger came to Telemachus.  

1468
03:02:19,439 --> 03:02:24,879
'Can you take me with you?' he 
asked. 'In Argos, my homeland,  

1469
03:02:25,600 --> 03:02:30,320
I have enemies who are trying to kill 
me. I think they have followed me here.'

1470
03:02:31,359 --> 03:02:36,719
'You are welcome to come with us,' replied 
Telemachus. 'We are going to Ithaca,  

1471
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:39,520
and there you can stay as my guest.'

1472
03:02:40,960 --> 03:02:46,960
'I am grateful for your kindness, good 
friend,' said the stranger. 'My name  

1473
03:02:47,760 --> 03:02:52,720
is Theoclymenus. In Argos I am a famous prophet.'

1474
03:02:54,640 --> 03:03:00,000
They all climbed on board, and the crew pulled 
on their oars until Pylos was far behind them.  

1475
03:03:01,359 --> 03:03:08,399
In open sea, they put up the sail and the 
wind carried them quickly towards Ithaca. As  

1476
03:03:08,399 --> 03:03:13,519
Telemachus stared out at the waves, he wondered 
what would happen at the end of the voyage.  

1477
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:19,359
Would he get home alive, or would the 
suitors succeed in their plan to murder him?

1478
03:03:23,279 --> 03:03:27,920
At the same time, Odysseus was having 
supper with Eumaeus in the hut.  

1479
03:03:29,279 --> 03:03:36,880
Wanting to test his host's loyalty, he said, 'I 
cannot take advantage of your kindness any longer.  

1480
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:41,920
Tomorrow I will go to town and 
ask for work at the palace.  

1481
03:03:42,800 --> 03:03:47,279
And I can tell Queen Penelope that 
her husband will soon be home.'

1482
03:03:47,840 --> 03:03:56,240
'No, no!' replied Eumaeus. 'Penelope has listened 
to too many stories about Odysseus already.  

1483
03:03:57,200 --> 03:04:01,040
You would do no good. You would just upset her.  

1484
03:04:02,800 --> 03:04:06,160
And the suitors in the palace will 
not want you as their servant.  

1485
03:04:07,040 --> 03:04:13,120
They are surrounded only by good-looking young 
men with oil in their hair and handsome clothes.  

1486
03:04:14,080 --> 03:04:18,399
You might die a violent death if you 
went to the palace in search of work.  

1487
03:04:19,439 --> 03:04:28,080
No, it is better to stay here with me. When my 
master's son, Telemachus, returns from Pylos,  

1488
03:04:28,080 --> 03:04:32,080
he will give you some new clothes 
and send you wherever you want.'

1489
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,479
'Your kindness continues, Eumaeus,'  

1490
03:04:37,439 --> 03:04:44,719
said his guest. 'I will wait for Telemachus 
s return as you suggest. But tell me,  

1491
03:04:45,520 --> 03:04:52,560
while I am here, about your masters family. 
Does he have a father or mother still living?'

1492
03:04:54,080 --> 03:05:00,960
'His father, Laertes, is still alive, 
but life brings him no happiness. He  

1493
03:05:00,960 --> 03:05:07,680
lost his son when Odysseus went to Troy, and 
then his dear wife died of a broken heart  

1494
03:05:07,680 --> 03:05:11,920
because of Odysseus's absence. 
She was a lovely woman.  

1495
03:05:13,040 --> 03:05:18,399
She was like a mother to me when I first 
came to Ithaca - I grew up in her house.'

1496
03:05:19,439 --> 03:05:25,200
'So you were still quite young when 
you came to Ithaca,' said Odysseus.

1497
03:05:26,399 --> 03:05:31,839
'What happened to you? How were you 
separated from your home and family?'

1498
03:05:32,720 --> 03:05:41,200
'Well, I was born in the far land of 
Syrie. My father, Ctesius, was its king.

1499
03:05:42,800 --> 03:05:48,400
One day a ship arrived from Phoenicia with 
lots of jewels and pretty things for sale.  

1500
03:05:49,840 --> 03:05:56,399
One of my father's servants was Phoenician. 
As a young girl, she had been stolen from  

1501
03:05:56,399 --> 03:06:02,879
her homeland by criminals. Now she was a 
tall, beautiful woman, good at her work,  

1502
03:06:03,680 --> 03:06:09,920
but not very sensible. Well, this servant fell 
in love with one of the Phoenician sailors.  

1503
03:06:10,800 --> 03:06:16,720
He offered to take her home with him to 
Phoenicia and she was very excited at the idea.  

1504
03:06:17,760 --> 03:06:22,960
But to pay for her voyage the sailors asked 
her to steal some gold from my father's palace.  

1505
03:06:24,640 --> 03:06:29,600
She agreed willingly, saying, "There is 
something else that I can give you too.  

1506
03:06:30,880 --> 03:06:38,240
At the palace I look after my master's young son. 
He is a clever boy and he follows me everywhere.  

1507
03:06:39,279 --> 03:06:44,399
If I brought him too, you could sell him 
for a high price at any foreign port."

1508
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:52,080
'The plan was made. She left the palace 
secretly with a bag full of gold cups,  

1509
03:06:52,080 --> 03:06:58,880
and I, innocent child, went with 
her. But a few days into our voyage,  

1510
03:06:58,880 --> 03:07:05,520
the servant died suddenly on the ship. Her 
body was thrown to the fishes and I was left  

1511
03:07:05,520 --> 03:07:11,760
friendless. Later we came to Ithaca and 
Laertes bought me from the Phoenicians.'

1512
03:07:13,120 --> 03:07:20,880
'What a strange story of bad luck,' said 
Odysseus. 'I am sorry for your troubles.  

1513
03:07:21,600 --> 03:07:26,320
But you had good luck too, since 
you were bought by a kind master.'

1514
03:07:27,840 --> 03:07:30,640
Their conversation continued far into the night,  

1515
03:07:31,200 --> 03:07:37,840
until it was time to sleep. At the same 
time, Telemachus had had a lucky night.  

1516
03:07:38,560 --> 03:07:44,161
His ship was near the coast of Ithaca, and 
the crew had not seen the murderous suitors.

1517
03:07:45,439 --> 03:07:51,839
'Land on that beach,' he said to the men. 'I 
am going to get off there and visit my farms.  

1518
03:07:52,399 --> 03:08:00,879
Take the ship to the city without me.' He turned 
to one of the oarsmen, his loyal friend Peiraeus,  

1519
03:08:01,520 --> 03:08:08,640
and said, 'Could you give Theoclymenus a bed for 
the night? I will meet you in the city tomorrow.'

1520
03:08:10,399 --> 03:08:15,839
The crew took the ship onto the beach 
and Telemachus jumped out. He watched  

1521
03:08:15,840 --> 03:08:22,000
his companions as they sailed towards the city, 
then started along the path to Eumaeus's hut.

1522
03:08:25,439 --> 03:08:32,399
Eumaeus and Odysseus were preparing breakfast when 
Telemachus appeared in the doorway. Eumaeus jumped  

1523
03:08:32,399 --> 03:08:40,080
up in surprise, and the bowls in his hands fell 
noisily to the floor. He threw his arms around his  

1524
03:08:40,080 --> 03:08:45,920
young master like a loving father welcoming 
back his dear son after many years abroad.

1525
03:08:46,720 --> 03:08:49,440
'You are back, then, Telemachus!  

1526
03:08:50,319 --> 03:08:56,960
And I thought that I would never see you 
again after you sailed to Pylos. Come in,  

1527
03:08:57,520 --> 03:09:04,640
come in, dear child, and let me look at you. I 
do not see you often enough here on the farm.'

1528
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:12,640
'It is good to see you too, Eumaeus. I have 
come here to ask for news from the palace.  

1529
03:09:13,920 --> 03:09:19,359
Is my mother still there, or has she married 
again and gone to her new husband's home?'

1530
03:09:20,319 --> 03:09:27,439
'She is still at the palace,' said the pig farmer. 
'And she still spends most of her days in tears.'

1531
03:09:28,960 --> 03:09:35,760
Telemachus came into the hut, and Odysseus stood 
up to give him his seat. But Telemachus stopped  

1532
03:09:35,760 --> 03:09:43,840
him. 'Please, stranger, do not get up. I am sure 
that there is something else for me to sit on.'

1533
03:09:45,200 --> 03:09:50,319
Eumaeus made another seat of sticks 
and sheepskin, and Telemachus sat  

1534
03:09:50,319 --> 03:09:57,920
down next to his father, Odysseus. 'So 
who is your guest, Eumaeus?' he asked.

1535
03:09:57,920 --> 03:10:02,800
'He is from Crete,' replied the 
servant, 'but he cannot go back there.  

1536
03:10:03,680 --> 03:10:06,720
I am hoping that you can look 
after him at the palace.'

1537
03:10:07,359 --> 03:10:15,679
'The palace?' cried Telemachus. 'But how can I? My 
mother is usually too upset to receive visitors,  

1538
03:10:16,319 --> 03:10:23,840
and the suitors are a dangerous crowd. I can 
do little to protect him against so many. I  

1539
03:10:23,840 --> 03:10:29,279
am happy to give him food and new clothes. 
And I will send him wherever he wants to go.  

1540
03:10:30,319 --> 03:10:36,479
But while he is in Ithaca he should stay 
here with you. It will be safer for him here.  

1541
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:45,359
But now, Eumaeus, old friend, can I ask you to 
take a message to my mother? Tell her that I am  

1542
03:10:45,359 --> 03:10:52,239
back from Pylos. Tell no one except her. There 
are many people who are trying to harm me.'

1543
03:10:53,359 --> 03:10:59,040
Eumaeus wasted no time. He left the hut 
immediately in the direction of the palace.

1544
03:11:00,239 --> 03:11:07,040
Athene saw him go. She appeared suddenly at the 
door of the hut, although only Odysseus could  

1545
03:11:07,040 --> 03:11:14,560
see her. Odysseus followed her outside, where she 
said, 'It is time to tell your son who you are.  

1546
03:11:15,680 --> 03:11:21,840
Together you must start planning the fate 
of those men in your palace.' As she spoke,  

1547
03:11:22,479 --> 03:11:28,000
she took away his disguise of old age. 
His strength and good looks returned;  

1548
03:11:28,640 --> 03:11:33,440
his beard grew dark on his chin; 
and he was wearing fine new clothes.  

1549
03:11:34,640 --> 03:11:38,720
Then the goddess disappeared, and 
Odysseus went back into the hut.

1550
03:11:42,080 --> 03:11:51,279
Telemachus looked at him now in wonder. 'Stranger, 
you look completely different. Only the gods can  

1551
03:11:51,279 --> 03:11:57,359
change their appearance in this way. Which 
god are you, and what can I do for you?'

1552
03:11:58,720 --> 03:12:01,840
'I am not a god,' replied Odysseus.  

1553
03:12:02,960 --> 03:12:08,399
'But I am your father, who has been 
the cause of so many problems for you.'

1554
03:12:09,760 --> 03:12:13,200
He kissed his son, and tears ran down his face.  

1555
03:12:14,239 --> 03:12:20,880
But Telemachus stepped back from him. 
'You are not my father,' he said. 'A  

1556
03:12:20,880 --> 03:12:27,200
god is playing a cruel trick on me. No man can 
change his appearance as you have just done.'

1557
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:31,840
'I promise you that this is no trick.  

1558
03:12:32,399 --> 03:12:37,920
My disguise was the work of Athene, who has 
been a great help to me in my troubles.'

1559
03:12:39,359 --> 03:12:41,920
Telemachus was satisfied by this answer.  

1560
03:12:42,960 --> 03:12:49,760
He threw his arms around his father's neck. 
Together they cried tears of great sadness and  

1561
03:12:49,760 --> 03:12:56,160
great happiness. This was the moment that 
they had both dreamt about for so many years.

1562
03:12:57,520 --> 03:13:02,640
'But how did you get to Ithaca?' 
Telemachus asked finally.

1563
03:13:04,319 --> 03:13:10,160
'In a Phaeacian ship. I have a great pile 
of treasure, which is hidden in a cave by  

1564
03:13:10,160 --> 03:13:16,000
the beach. But we should waste no time. 
We must plan the death of those suitors.  

1565
03:13:17,520 --> 03:13:22,081
Tell me how many of them there are. 
Then I can decide how to fight them.'

1566
03:13:23,600 --> 03:13:29,439
'There are more than a hundred suitors. I know 
that you have a great reputation as a soldier,  

1567
03:13:29,439 --> 03:13:32,879
Father. But we cannot possibly fight them alone.  

1568
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:36,560
We must think of some people 
who will fight with us.'

1569
03:13:37,439 --> 03:13:44,000
'Athene and Zeus will fight with us,' his father 
replied. 'Their help will be enough, I think.'

1570
03:13:45,120 --> 03:13:50,000
'If you are right, then the suitors 
have no chance,' Telemachus agreed.

1571
03:13:51,200 --> 03:13:58,960
'Tomorrow,' continued Odysseus, you will go back 
to the palace. I will join you later in the day,  

1572
03:13:58,960 --> 03:14:06,720
disguised again as an old man. If the suitors 
are rough with me, do not worry. Their day of  

1573
03:14:06,720 --> 03:14:14,239
judgment is coming. But tell no one about my 
return - not my father Laertes, or Eumaeus,  

1574
03:14:14,239 --> 03:14:22,080
or even your mother. It must be a complete secret 
until we have destroyed the suitors' power.'

1575
03:14:23,200 --> 03:14:30,000
'We must do that very soon, or Mother will 
marry one of them. Then it will be too late.'

1576
03:14:31,840 --> 03:14:37,840
As father and son discussed their plans, 
Telemachus's crew arrived at the port in the city.  

1577
03:14:38,880 --> 03:14:45,520
A messenger was sent to tell Penelope that her 
son was safe. This messenger arrived at the palace  

1578
03:14:45,520 --> 03:14:51,840
at the same time as Eumaeus, and soon gave the 
queen his message in front of all her servants.  

1579
03:14:52,720 --> 03:14:58,880
In private, Eumaeus told her everything 
that he knew. Then he went back to his  

1580
03:14:58,880 --> 03:15:05,840
farm - to Telemachus and Odysseus, who 
Athene had changed back into an old man.

1581
03:15:07,200 --> 03:15:12,639
The news of Telemachus's return soon 
spread to the suitors, who were very angry.  

1582
03:15:13,520 --> 03:15:18,161
When Antinous's ship came into port, they 
rushed to find out what had happened.

1583
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:27,040
'The lucky young fool!' shouted Antinous. 'My 
people were looking for him all along the coast,  

1584
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:34,720
but he managed to get past us. We must find 
another way to kill him, and do it fast.  

1585
03:15:35,600 --> 03:15:41,280
If we do not, he will call another meeting 
and turn the people of Ithaca against us.  

1586
03:15:42,800 --> 03:15:49,360
They will not be happy that we have tried to 
murder their prince. If we are not careful,  

1587
03:15:50,319 --> 03:15:52,399
we will soon be thrown off this island.  

1588
03:15:53,520 --> 03:16:00,081
We have no choice. We must kill 
him now, before it is too late.'

1589
03:16:01,680 --> 03:16:11,120
Silence followed this speech. Finally, Amphinomus 
stood up to speak. He was a more thoughtful man  

1590
03:16:11,120 --> 03:16:19,359
than the rest, one of the few suitors who Penelope 
liked to talk to. 'My friends,' he said now,  

1591
03:16:20,319 --> 03:16:27,359
'I cannot agree to this murder. It is wrong to 
kill a prince, unless the gods have given clear  

1592
03:16:27,359 --> 03:16:34,399
signs that they want him dead. We should wait for 
those signs. Until then, we should do nothing.'

1593
03:16:35,840 --> 03:16:44,319
The other suitors agreed with him. For 
the moment, Telemachus was safe.
 
 
 

1594
03:16:44,319 --> 03:16:45,519
CHAPTER TEN

1595
03:16:45,520 --> 03:16:46,960
Odysseus at the Palace

1596
03:16:48,560 --> 03:16:54,960
She quickly looked up at the stranger above 
her, and she knew - her master had returned.

1597
03:16:57,200 --> 03:17:01,359
The next morning, Telemachus prepared 
to visit his mother at the palace.  

1598
03:17:02,319 --> 03:17:05,759
As he left Eumaeus's hut, 
he said to the pig farmer,  

1599
03:17:06,560 --> 03:17:12,560
After I have gone, take our visitor to the 
city. He can ask the people there for food.'

1600
03:17:15,200 --> 03:17:20,960
Telemachus met the prophet Theoclymenus in 
town, then walked with him to the palace.  

1601
03:17:22,319 --> 03:17:28,559
Loyal old Eurycleia was the first to see her 
young master, and she ran up to him with a cry  

1602
03:17:28,560 --> 03:17:36,640
of happiness. The other servants followed, and 
finally Penelope came out of her room. Tears ran  

1603
03:17:36,640 --> 03:17:44,479
down her face as she threw her arms around him. 
'You are back, my child! And I thought I would  

1604
03:17:44,479 --> 03:17:51,519
never see you again after your secret departure. 
But come, tell me what you learnt on your voyage.'

1605
03:17:53,040 --> 03:18:00,800
'Well, we went first to Pylos. King Nestor 
received us kindly, but knew nothing about  

1606
03:18:00,800 --> 03:18:08,319
Odysseus's fate. He lent me a chariot, though, 
and with his son Peisistratus I went by land  

1607
03:18:08,319 --> 03:18:16,239
to Sparta and the palace of King Menelaus. 
During Menelaus's journey home from the war,  

1608
03:18:16,239 --> 03:18:21,840
he met the god Proteus. Proteus told 
him that my father was still alive,  

1609
03:18:22,560 --> 03:18:28,161
a prisoner on the goddess Calypso's island, 
without a ship or a crew to take him home.'

1610
03:18:30,640 --> 03:18:37,520
Telemachus's words warmed his mother's 
heart. Then his guest Theoclymenus added,  

1611
03:18:38,160 --> 03:18:47,599
'Great Penelope, Menelaus's information is old. 
Listen to my prophecy. Your husband Odysseus is  

1612
03:18:47,600 --> 03:18:54,720
already in Ithaca, studying his enemies, the 
suitors, and planning their day of judgment.'

1613
03:18:56,160 --> 03:18:59,519
'I pray that you are right,' replied Penelope.

1614
03:19:01,600 --> 03:19:07,920
Eumaeus and Odysseus were preparing to walk to 
the city. 'Are you sure you want to do this?'  

1615
03:19:08,479 --> 03:19:18,000
asked Eumaeus. 'The walk is not easy for a man of 
your age. Why not stay here in the hut instead?'

1616
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:24,720
'Thank you, Eumaeus,' replied his guest. 
'But your young master Telemachus is right.  

1617
03:19:25,680 --> 03:19:32,400
It is time for me to go. Could I ask you, 
though, for a stick to help me walk?'  

1618
03:19:33,840 --> 03:19:37,200
Eumaeus got him a stick and 
they started their journey.  

1619
03:19:38,640 --> 03:19:46,080
The path was steep, but Odysseus went slowly and 
carefully and before long they came to a stream at  

1620
03:19:46,080 --> 03:19:53,120
the edge of the city. There they met Melanthius, 
who also looked after a farm on Odysseus's land.  

1621
03:19:54,160 --> 03:20:01,200
When this man saw Eumaeus, he immediately 
started shouting at him. 'Where are you  

1622
03:20:01,200 --> 03:20:08,559
going with that old ruin of a man? I hope you 
are not planning to take him to the palace.  

1623
03:20:09,520 --> 03:20:14,960
I doubt that he will manage a day in the 
suitors' company without broken bones.  

1624
03:20:15,920 --> 03:20:22,560
And the suitors are right too. He is a 
lazy fool who deserves nothing better.'

1625
03:20:24,880 --> 03:20:32,239
Melanthius then gave Odysseus a hard kick 
that almost knocked him over. As Odysseus was  

1626
03:20:32,239 --> 03:20:39,760
preparing to fight back, Eumaeus cried, 'Great 
Zeus, I pray that my master is returned to us.  

1627
03:20:40,640 --> 03:20:45,920
He would soon cure Melanthius of the arrogant 
ways that he has learnt from the suitors.'

1628
03:20:47,520 --> 03:20:55,040
Melanthius laughed as he walked away. 'Odysseus's 
chance of returning is as low as Telemachus s  

1629
03:20:55,040 --> 03:21:03,439
chance of escaping the suitors' violence. Things 
have changed, Eumaeus. You have new masters now.'

1630
03:21:08,080 --> 03:21:11,840
The pig farmer and the old man 
continued towards the palace.  

1631
03:21:12,960 --> 03:21:19,200
There was a dog called Argus lying 
near the gates. When he was younger,  

1632
03:21:19,200 --> 03:21:25,760
he had been an excellent hunting dog, trained 
by Odysseus himself and famous for his speed.

1633
03:21:27,040 --> 03:21:32,319
But now he was old and lay all day 
in the dust, alone and forgotten.  

1634
03:21:34,399 --> 03:21:40,000
When this dog heard the sound of Odysseus's 
voice, he lifted his head and moved his  

1635
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:45,520
tail in excitement. He did not have the 
strength to get up and greet his master.  

1636
03:21:47,120 --> 03:21:54,800
Odysseus saw his old hunting companion and gently 
touched the dog's head. At that same moment,  

1637
03:21:55,600 --> 03:22:02,240
Argus died - happy at last after waiting 
twenty years for his master's return.

1638
03:22:04,800 --> 03:22:12,239
Eumaeus went into the palace and joined Telemachus 
at the dinner in the hall. Odysseus followed a few  

1639
03:22:12,239 --> 03:22:20,160
minutes later and sat quietly in a dark corner. 
Seeing him there, Telemachus sent him a plate  

1640
03:22:20,160 --> 03:22:28,160
of food and an empty bag. Odysseus went from table 
to table, asking the suitors for food for his bag.

1641
03:22:29,520 --> 03:22:36,720
'I am a poor man,' he said to each man in 
the hall. 'Please, take pity on my hunger.'  

1642
03:22:38,239 --> 03:22:43,519
When the suitors saw the thin old man, 
most gave him food from their plate.  

1643
03:22:44,319 --> 03:22:50,799
But Antinous had other ideas. 
'Who let this smelly old fool  

1644
03:22:50,800 --> 03:23:00,720
into the city? There are enough poor people on 
Ithaca already. How rude he is, asking for food  

1645
03:23:00,720 --> 03:23:06,240
when he offers nothing in return. You should 
throw him out of the palace, Telemachus.'

1646
03:23:07,680 --> 03:23:11,201
'Thank you for your advice,' replied Telemachus.  

1647
03:23:11,840 --> 03:23:19,920
'You are very anxious not to let my food go 
to waste, I see! How can you be so greedy,  

1648
03:23:19,920 --> 03:23:25,600
Antinous? You have plenty on your 
plate. Give some of it to our guest.'

1649
03:23:26,399 --> 03:23:36,559
'I will do as I wish,' Antinous shouted back. He 
picked up a chair and threw it at Odysseus. It hit  

1650
03:23:36,560 --> 03:23:42,720
him hard on the shoulder. Telemachus managed 
to control his anger when he saw the attack.  

1651
03:23:43,680 --> 03:23:51,680
Odysseus, too, stayed calm. He looked around the 
hall at the suitors, saying, 'You are fortunate  

1652
03:23:51,680 --> 03:23:58,880
men, who know nothing about hunger. Does an 
empty stomach deserve this violent treatment?  

1653
03:24:00,080 --> 03:24:06,239
I hope that the gods are watching, and that 
Antinous will be dead before his wedding day.'  

1654
03:24:08,319 --> 03:24:11,840
Then he went back to sit on his 
chair in the corner of the hall.

1655
03:24:13,120 --> 03:24:16,399
The other suitors were shocked 
by Antinous's behavior.  

1656
03:24:17,920 --> 03:24:26,160
Amphinomus spoke for them all when he said, 'This 
old man might be a god in disguise, Antinous.

1657
03:24:26,160 --> 03:24:30,239
Be careful, or you will soon 
meet the fate that you deserve.'  

1658
03:24:31,600 --> 03:24:34,800
Amphinomus then walked over to Odysseus and said,  

1659
03:24:35,680 --> 03:24:42,880
'Your health, my friend! Fortune has not been kind 
to you recently, but I wish you a happy future.'

1660
03:24:44,800 --> 03:24:50,880
'Amphinomus,' Odysseus replied, 
you seem to be a sensible man.  

1661
03:24:52,000 --> 03:24:55,680
Why do you spend your days 
with these arrogant suitors?  

1662
03:24:56,560 --> 03:25:03,040
I have seen their violence and their greedy 
ways. And I know that Odysseus will soon be home.  

1663
03:25:04,399 --> 03:25:12,960
Listen to my advice, Amphinomus. Leave now and 
save yourself from Odysseus's bloody punishment.'

1664
03:25:15,120 --> 03:25:23,200
Amphinomus walked back to the table shakily, his 
mind full of doubt. Then he took some more meat  

1665
03:25:23,200 --> 03:25:25,760
and joined in the other suitors' conversation.

1666
03:25:27,680 --> 03:25:32,640
News of Antinous's attack on the stranger 
soon reached Penelope in her room.  

1667
03:25:33,920 --> 03:25:42,080
'I hope that the gods strike Antinous as he struck 
that old man!' she cried to her servants. 'I hate  

1668
03:25:42,080 --> 03:25:49,840
all the suitors, but Antinous is even worse 
than the rest. He has a cold and cruel heart.'

1669
03:25:54,479 --> 03:26:00,319
She called Eumaeus to her so that she could 
ask about the stranger. When she learnt  

1670
03:26:00,319 --> 03:26:06,000
that he had travelled widely and had news of 
Odysseus, she wanted to question him herself.  

1671
03:26:07,279 --> 03:26:11,279
But she decided to wait until the 
suitors had gone home to their beds.

1672
03:26:12,720 --> 03:26:18,399
First, though, she wanted to talk 
to her son. 'It is not good for him  

1673
03:26:18,399 --> 03:26:23,359
to spend so much time in the company of 
those suitors,' she said to Eurycleia.

1674
03:26:24,880 --> 03:26:30,319
'You are right,' replied the servant. 
'But you can be grateful, at least,  

1675
03:26:30,319 --> 03:26:33,359
that Telemachus has returned home safely  

1676
03:26:33,359 --> 03:26:40,000
and seems so grown up. It was always your greatest 
wish to see your son with a beard on his face.'

1677
03:26:41,840 --> 03:26:46,160
Penelope thought about her servant's 
words as she walked down to the hall.  

1678
03:26:47,200 --> 03:26:55,359
There, turning to her son, she said, 'Telemachus, 
you were always a sensible child, but now your  

1679
03:26:55,359 --> 03:27:02,559
good judgment has left you. Someone attacked 
an old man in this hall, and you did nothing  

1680
03:27:02,560 --> 03:27:07,280
to stop him! We are lucky that 
the stranger was not badly hurt.'

1681
03:27:08,239 --> 03:27:12,399
'Mother,' replied Telemachus, 
'you are right to be upset.  

1682
03:27:13,439 --> 03:27:19,519
But I cannot always control the behavior 
of your suitors. I am one against so many.'

1683
03:27:21,279 --> 03:27:28,719
Penelope now addressed the suitors. 'When my 
husband sailed to Troy, he warned me of the  

1684
03:27:28,720 --> 03:27:36,239
dangers that he would face. "I cannot promise that 
I will ever return," he said. "Wait patiently for  

1685
03:27:36,239 --> 03:27:43,439
me. But when you see a beard on our son's chin, 
it will be time for you to choose a new husband."

1686
03:27:44,960 --> 03:27:53,040
'Well, gentlemen, that time has come. I would 
prefer to die, but I must accept my fate.  

1687
03:27:54,399 --> 03:27:59,599
How, though, can I choose a husband, 
when none of my suitors behave correctly?  

1688
03:28:00,960 --> 03:28:07,120
Suitors usually bring their own animals to eat 
at dinners, and they also bring their lady gifts.  

1689
03:28:07,920 --> 03:28:11,840
They do not enjoy free meals 
given by their lady's own family.'

1690
03:28:13,040 --> 03:28:18,960
Antinous quickly replied, 'We will be 
happy to bring you presents, good lady.  

1691
03:28:20,000 --> 03:28:24,800
But we will not leave here - not 
until you have married one of us.'

1692
03:28:25,920 --> 03:28:31,680
The other suitors agreed. They sent servants 
to fetch the finest dresses and jewellery  

1693
03:28:31,680 --> 03:28:37,840
that they owned. Penelope accepted the 
gifts politely and took them to her room.

1694
03:28:39,680 --> 03:28:42,720
The suitors spent the rest of 
the day dancing and singing.  

1695
03:28:43,840 --> 03:28:51,840
But before darkness fell, Eurymachus started a 
conversation with Odysseus. 'Stranger,' he said,  

1696
03:28:53,439 --> 03:28:56,719
'I could give you a job on my lands if you wanted.  

1697
03:28:57,439 --> 03:29:03,919
You could build walls and plant trees, and 
receive food and clothes in payment. But I  

1698
03:29:03,920 --> 03:29:10,239
doubt that you want an honest job. You prefer 
to get your food for nothing, you lazy dog!'

1699
03:29:11,520 --> 03:29:18,880
'What an insult!' replied Odysseus. 'We 
should have a competition, you and I.  

1700
03:29:19,760 --> 03:29:25,120
We could see who works harder - at 
building walls or digging fields,  

1701
03:29:25,840 --> 03:29:31,600
or any other work that you choose. 
Or would you prefer a swordfight?  

1702
03:29:32,720 --> 03:29:43,920
I could beat you in anything, you arrogant fool. 
You think you are a big man, a hero, but you  

1703
03:29:43,920 --> 03:29:52,319
have never had to face a real hero. If Odysseus 
returned now, you would soon run away in fear.'

1704
03:29:56,560 --> 03:30:04,479
Eurymachus was very angry. He took a chair 
and threw it at Odysseus. Odysseus stepped  

1705
03:30:04,479 --> 03:30:11,279
out of the way just in time, but it hit one 
of the servants. This man fell to the ground,  

1706
03:30:11,920 --> 03:30:18,880
dropping the wine cup that he was holding. There 
was a loud crash, and everyone started shouting.

1707
03:30:20,560 --> 03:30:24,880
Telemachus called out, 'What is 
wrong with you all this evening?  

1708
03:30:26,160 --> 03:30:33,599
Perhaps you have had too much wine. But it is 
late now. I suggest you all go home to your beds.'

1709
03:30:34,960 --> 03:30:38,319
The suitors were surprised by 
Telemachus's new confidence,  

1710
03:30:39,040 --> 03:30:44,960
but they followed his advice. Soon only 
Telemachus and his father were left in the hall.

1711
03:30:46,160 --> 03:30:48,720
Odysseus took advantage of their time alone.  

1712
03:30:49,520 --> 03:30:54,800
'Quick, Telemachus,' he said. 'We must 
collect all the swords in the hall  

1713
03:30:54,800 --> 03:31:01,760
and hide them in an upstairs room. Leave only 
two swords here - one for you and one for me.'

1714
03:31:02,800 --> 03:31:07,279
'But what will I say if the suitors 
notice their absence?' asked Telemachus.

1715
03:31:08,080 --> 03:31:10,559
'Say that you are worried about their fights  

1716
03:31:10,560 --> 03:31:16,240
when they have drunk too much wine. You have 
taken the swords away for their own safety.'

1717
03:31:18,000 --> 03:31:21,600
When the swords were safely 
hidden, Telemachus went to bed.  

1718
03:31:22,800 --> 03:31:28,400
Penelope chose this quiet time of the evening to 
come down from her room and meet the stranger.  

1719
03:31:29,600 --> 03:31:33,121
Her servants came too, to clear 
the plates from the tables.

1720
03:31:34,640 --> 03:31:38,400
'Come and sit with me by the 
fire, stranger,' said Penelope.  

1721
03:31:39,359 --> 03:31:41,839
'Tell me who you are and where you come from.'

1722
03:31:43,760 --> 03:31:50,160
'Please do not ask me about my home and 
family,' replied Odysseus. 'I have had a  

1723
03:31:50,160 --> 03:31:55,519
sad and difficult life. But no one likes 
to hear about other people's troubles.  

1724
03:31:56,479 --> 03:31:58,160
Let us talk about something else.'

1725
03:31:59,359 --> 03:32:05,439
'I, too, have had a sad and difficult 
life, stranger,' said Penelope. 'Since  

1726
03:32:05,439 --> 03:32:10,960
my husband's departure for the war in Troy, 
the passing years have brought me only tears.  

1727
03:32:11,920 --> 03:32:16,720
And now my father wants me to marry one of 
the men who behave so rudely in my home.  

1728
03:32:18,319 --> 03:32:22,239
But tell me about yourself. I 
would like to know your story.'

1729
03:32:23,680 --> 03:32:27,440
The old man repeated the story that 
he had told Eumaeus in his hut.  

1730
03:32:28,720 --> 03:32:34,800
When Penelope heard that he had once met Odysseus 
in Crete, she decided to test his honesty.

1731
03:32:35,680 --> 03:32:40,560
'Tell me, stranger, what Odysseus 
was like in those days. Can you  

1732
03:32:40,560 --> 03:32:45,121
remember any details of his clothes, 
or any companions that were with him?'

1733
03:32:46,319 --> 03:32:53,759
'It was twenty years ago, so I do not 
remember much. But I have not forgotten this:  

1734
03:32:54,960 --> 03:33:02,080
his clothes were a deep purple colour, and he also 
wore a gold pin with a picture of a dog on it.  

1735
03:33:02,960 --> 03:33:12,000
Everyone admired that pin. He had many companions, 
but he seemed closest to a man called Eurybates.'

1736
03:33:13,200 --> 03:33:19,359
Penelope was pleased with his answer. 
'Friend, those were the clothes and  

1737
03:33:19,359 --> 03:33:25,279
the pin that I gave him when he left. But I 
will never again see the man who wore them.'

1738
03:33:26,319 --> 03:33:34,479
'Dear lady, do not upset yourself. I heard 
in Thesprotia that your husband was planning  

1739
03:33:34,479 --> 03:33:42,879
to sail here this week. For many years he was a 
prisoner far across the seas on Calypso's island,  

1740
03:33:43,840 --> 03:33:50,239
but now he is almost home. I promise 
you, he will be here very soon.'

1741
03:33:52,239 --> 03:33:59,840
'I hope that you are right, but I cannot believe 
it. In my heart I know that he will never return.  

1742
03:34:01,200 --> 03:34:08,399
But enough of this. The servants must get you 
a blanket. And Eurycleia, the oldest and best  

1743
03:34:08,399 --> 03:34:14,639
of them, will wash your feet.' She called 
to Eurycleia. 'Come and help, old friend.  

1744
03:34:15,520 --> 03:34:22,720
Wash the dust from this man's aching feet. He once 
knew Odysseus, and has travelled far and wide.  

1745
03:34:23,680 --> 03:34:28,960
If Odysseus is still alive somewhere, 
his feet will be aching and dusty too.'

1746
03:34:30,560 --> 03:34:35,201
'Oh, Odysseus,' cried the servant 
as she fetched a bowl of water,  

1747
03:34:36,319 --> 03:34:43,120
'the gods are so cruel! I looked after you 
as a baby, and still love you like a son.  

1748
03:34:44,479 --> 03:34:49,200
I want to be able to wash your 
feet, not the feet of a stranger.'

1749
03:34:50,479 --> 03:34:56,399
She sat at the stranger's feet to wash them, while 
Penelope gave instructions to the other servants.  

1750
03:34:57,520 --> 03:35:05,040
'Old man,' said Eurycleia, 'we have had many 
travellers at the palace before, but none of  

1751
03:35:05,040 --> 03:35:12,239
them looked like Odysseus. You, though, have 
a very similar voice, and similar feet too...'

1752
03:35:13,600 --> 03:35:20,240
She started to wash his feet. As she passed 
her hands over his legs, she felt a scar.  

1753
03:35:21,520 --> 03:35:25,600
She remembered that Odysseus had had 
a scar in exactly the same place,  

1754
03:35:26,399 --> 03:35:28,559
from a hunting accident when he was a boy.  

1755
03:35:29,840 --> 03:35:36,239
She quickly looked up at the stranger above 
her, and she knew - her master had returned.  

1756
03:35:37,439 --> 03:35:41,759
She dropped his foot in shock, and it 
knocked over the bowl with a crash.  

1757
03:35:42,800 --> 03:35:48,560
But as the servant started to shout to 
Penelope, Odysseus put his hand over her mouth.

1758
03:35:49,520 --> 03:35:57,121
'Say nothing, dear Eurycleia,' he 
whispered. 'No one in the palace can know.'

1759
03:35:58,640 --> 03:36:05,840
'I will be as silent as a stone, my 
child,' she answered with a smile.
 
 
 

1760
03:36:08,800 --> 03:36:09,680
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1761
03:36:10,720 --> 03:36:11,920
The Day of Judgement

1762
03:36:13,680 --> 03:36:20,080
'The walls of this hall will be covered with your 
blood, and screams of pain will fill the air.'

1763
03:36:22,560 --> 03:36:26,640
Odysseus could not sleep that night. He lay awake  

1764
03:36:26,640 --> 03:36:31,760
under the blanket that the servants had brought 
him, thinking angrily about the suitors.  

1765
03:36:32,960 --> 03:36:38,720
They deserved to die. But how could 
he and Telemachus alone kill so many?

1766
03:36:40,080 --> 03:36:48,319
Athene came down from Mount Olympus to talk to 
him. 'Are you sleepless again, Odysseus? Stop  

1767
03:36:48,319 --> 03:36:56,559
worrying! You are in your own home, under the same 
roof as your wife and son. And you have a goddess  

1768
03:36:56,560 --> 03:37:04,960
to help you. You and I could kill ten times this 
number of suitors. Their fate is already decided.'

1769
03:37:06,640 --> 03:37:11,760
Then she closed Odysseus's eyes in 
sleep and returned to Mount Olympus.

1770
03:37:12,960 --> 03:37:20,880
At the same moment, Penelope woke. In her 
dream, she had seen Odysseus next to her in bed.  

1771
03:37:21,760 --> 03:37:26,640
He was young and good-looking, as he had 
been on the day of his departure for Troy.  

1772
03:37:27,840 --> 03:37:34,239
The thought of him brought tears to her 
eyes. 'Oh gods,' she cried, 'let me die!  

1773
03:37:35,439 --> 03:37:39,839
A painful death would be better than 
marriage to any man who is not Odysseus.'

1774
03:37:42,319 --> 03:37:47,519
In the morning, the palace was busy with 
preparations for a meal even bigger than  

1775
03:37:47,520 --> 03:37:53,760
usual. The day was a public holiday, and 
the suitors planned to celebrate it well.

1776
03:37:55,200 --> 03:38:00,000
Eumaeus arrived with some pigs for the 
meal, and the cow farmer Philoetius  

1777
03:38:00,000 --> 03:38:07,040
also brought some animals. When he saw Odysseus 
sitting quietly in a corner, he stopped suddenly  

1778
03:38:07,040 --> 03:38:15,760
and stared. 'Greetings, stranger,' he said. 'You 
confused me just then, because you reminded me  

1779
03:38:15,760 --> 03:38:22,640
so much of my master Odysseus. Oh, it would 
be a wonderful surprise if he ever came home.  

1780
03:38:23,760 --> 03:38:29,520
I often think of leaving Ithaca so that I do 
not have to obey the arrogant suitors' orders.  

1781
03:38:30,880 --> 03:38:35,920
But I cannot do it, because I cannot 
give up all hope of my master's return.'

1782
03:38:37,040 --> 03:38:46,000
Odysseus replied, 'You are clearly a loyal and 
honest servant, so I will give you some news.  

1783
03:38:47,040 --> 03:38:55,040
Odysseus is on his way home. Before the end of the 
day, you will see him again with your own eyes.'

1784
03:38:56,960 --> 03:39:02,800
'Stranger, I hope that you are 
right. It is my dearest wish.'

1785
03:39:04,720 --> 03:39:13,279
The farmer Melanthius, who had also come for the 
meal, heard their conversation. 'This smelly old  

1786
03:39:13,279 --> 03:39:22,639
man is mad, Philoetius,' he laughed. 'And you are 
mad too, if you listen to his crazy prophecies.'

1787
03:39:26,479 --> 03:39:30,319
When the food was ready, everyone 
took their seats in the hall.  

1788
03:39:31,120 --> 03:39:37,599
Telemachus carefully made sure that Odysseus 
was given a seat near the doorway. 'Sit and  

1789
03:39:37,600 --> 03:39:45,040
eat with the suitors,' he said loudly. 'Suitors, 
there will be no fights or insults here today.'

1790
03:39:46,080 --> 03:39:52,239
But they did not listen. Soon they were 
shouting and laughing at Odysseus. One  

1791
03:39:52,239 --> 03:39:58,639
of them threw a cow's foot at his head, but it 
missed. Telemachus turned to the man and said,  

1792
03:39:59,279 --> 03:40:06,639
'You were lucky that that did not hit him. I will 
put my sword through any man who strikes my guest.  

1793
03:40:08,080 --> 03:40:15,040
I am not a child now. I cannot stop you eating 
my food and drinking my wine - there are too  

1794
03:40:15,040 --> 03:40:22,560
many of you. But I will stop your bad behavior. 
If you want to murder me for that, then do it.  

1795
03:40:23,439 --> 03:40:26,639
I would prefer to die than 
to let you hurt my guest.'

1796
03:40:27,840 --> 03:40:31,359
The suitors laughed at his 
words, until they saw strange  

1797
03:40:31,359 --> 03:40:35,839
drops of blood on their food. 
Was this a sign from the gods?

1798
03:40:37,279 --> 03:40:41,279
At that moment, the voice of the 
prophet Theoclymenus was heard.

1799
03:40:42,239 --> 03:40:44,800
'Unhappy men,' he cried,  

1800
03:40:45,600 --> 03:40:51,520
'this is my prophecy. The walls of this 
hall will be covered with your blood,  

1801
03:40:52,080 --> 03:41:00,160
and screams of pain will fill the air. Your ghosts 
will soon be on their way to the Underworld.'

1802
03:41:00,160 --> 03:41:08,479
Eurymachus laughed at him. 'He is out of his 
mind, poor man. Can someone show him the door?'

1803
03:41:09,920 --> 03:41:17,920
'I need no help to find the door, Eurymachus,' 
replied Theoclymenus. 'I am going through it now.  

1804
03:41:18,880 --> 03:41:28,080
I can see disaster coming your way, and I want to 
be as far from you as possible when it arrives.'

1805
03:41:28,080 --> 03:41:36,160
He left the hall. The suitors looked at each other 
nervously, but then started to laugh again. 'You  

1806
03:41:36,160 --> 03:41:43,840
have chosen some strange people to invite here 
as your guests, Telemachus,' said one. 'First  

1807
03:41:43,840 --> 03:41:51,360
a smelly old man, and now a mad prophet.' 
At this point Penelope entered the hall.  

1808
03:41:52,160 --> 03:41:58,080
She had spent the morning thinking sadly about 
her situation. Now she had reached a decision.

1809
03:41:59,199 --> 03:42:05,120
'Suitors,' she said, you have taken 
advantage of my son for long enough.  

1810
03:42:06,239 --> 03:42:11,359
Although I have no wish to marry 
again, I must now choose a new husband.

1811
03:42:12,479 --> 03:42:17,120
That is the only way to save my son's 
property from your greedy hands.  

1812
03:42:18,319 --> 03:42:24,960
Today will be the last day that you eat 
free food in this palace. Tomorrow I will  

1813
03:42:24,960 --> 03:42:30,080
go to the home of my chosen husband, and 
the rest of you will leave this place.

1814
03:42:31,600 --> 03:42:39,040
'As you can see, I am carrying a bow. This 
belonged to my husband, the famous hero  

1815
03:42:39,040 --> 03:42:45,760
Odysseus. I will marry the man among you 
who is most skilled at using this bow.  

1816
03:42:46,960 --> 03:42:54,160
You must string it, which is not easy if you do 
not have Odysseus's great strength. And then you  

1817
03:42:54,160 --> 03:43:01,920
must shoot an arrow through twelve axe handles. 
Telemachus, please arrange the axes in a line.'

1818
03:43:03,439 --> 03:43:06,960
Telemachus took the axes that his 
mothers' servants were carrying.  

1819
03:43:07,920 --> 03:43:13,920
He dug the axe heads into the ground, so that the 
metal rings on the handles were exactly in line.  

1820
03:43:14,880 --> 03:43:22,160
Then he said, 'Gentlemen, you have your 
instructions for the competition. But before  

1821
03:43:22,160 --> 03:43:29,920
you start, I would like to try the bow myself. 
Tomorrow I will have to say goodbye to my mother.  

1822
03:43:30,720 --> 03:43:36,160
But if I succeed with the bow, at least I 
will know that I am as strong as my father.'

1823
03:43:38,640 --> 03:43:45,760
Telemachus stood in the doorway with the bow. 
Three times he tried to bend it, but three times  

1824
03:43:45,760 --> 03:43:54,880
his strength failed. The bow shook but it did 
not bend. He tried a fourth time and felt that he  

1825
03:43:54,880 --> 03:44:02,239
would succeed. But Odysseus shook his head gently 
and Telemachus put the bow back on the ground.

1826
03:44:03,600 --> 03:44:09,040
'Well, clearly I will always be known 
as a weak man compared to my father,'  

1827
03:44:09,600 --> 03:44:15,840
he said. 'This bow is too much 
for me. Who else will try it?'

1828
03:44:19,199 --> 03:44:25,679
Leodes was the first suitor to come 
forward. He tried and tried to bend the bow,  

1829
03:44:26,640 --> 03:44:36,640
but it was impossible. 'Friends, I cannot 
do it,' he said. 'Let someone else try. But  

1830
03:44:36,640 --> 03:44:44,160
I fear that this bow will break the heart 
of many men here today.' Antinous cried,  

1831
03:44:44,160 --> 03:44:51,439
'Do you think that you are the strongest man 
in the room, Leodes? You cannot string the bow,  

1832
03:44:52,239 --> 03:44:55,040
but others will do it. Wait and see.'

1833
03:44:57,439 --> 03:44:59,919
Other men tried, but they failed too.  

1834
03:45:00,960 --> 03:45:06,800
Eurymachus and Antinous watched and 
waited, learning from the others' mistakes.

1835
03:45:08,560 --> 03:45:15,199
At this point Eumaeus and Philoetius the 
cow farmer left the hall. The competition  

1836
03:45:15,199 --> 03:45:21,519
was bringing to an end their hopes for Odysseus's 
happy return. They could not watch it any longer.

1837
03:45:22,800 --> 03:45:31,439
But Odysseus came running after them. 'My 
friends,' he said, 'do not leave yet. I have an  

1838
03:45:31,439 --> 03:45:39,839
important question for you. If Odysseus returned, 
would you fight with him, or with the suitors?'

1839
03:45:40,880 --> 03:45:47,199
'You would soon see the strength of my right arm 
if I could fight the suitors at Odysseus's side!'  

1840
03:45:47,840 --> 03:45:51,840
Philoetius replied. Eumaeus 
agreed enthusiastically.

1841
03:45:53,120 --> 03:46:04,800
Odysseus continued, 'Well, here I am! 
Yes, it is true - I am your master,  

1842
03:46:05,439 --> 03:46:11,599
returned at last. Look, here is the scar 
that I got in a hunting accident as a boy.'

1843
03:46:12,800 --> 03:46:18,160
As he spoke, he showed them his 
leg. When they saw the scar,  

1844
03:46:18,160 --> 03:46:23,120
the farmers threw their arms around their 
master and tears ran down their faces.

1845
03:46:24,960 --> 03:46:29,040
'Stop crying,' said Odysseus, 
'or someone will see us.  

1846
03:46:30,160 --> 03:46:37,840
Now, I need your help. Come back inside and 
wait until I have the bow in my hands. Then,  

1847
03:46:38,560 --> 03:46:47,280
Philoetius, go and lock the palace gate. Eumaeus, 
you must lock the door to the women's rooms.  

1848
03:46:48,720 --> 03:46:52,320
Tell the servants not to listen to any 
noises that they hear in the hall.'

1849
03:46:54,239 --> 03:46:58,239
They went back inside and continued 
to watch the suitors with the bow.  

1850
03:46:59,439 --> 03:47:06,639
It was now Eurymachus's turn. He was a 
proud man, used to success in all things.  

1851
03:47:07,760 --> 03:47:16,000
He tried again and again to string the bow, but it 
refused to bend. Finally, he cried out in anger,  

1852
03:47:16,560 --> 03:47:20,800
'Stupid bow! This is bad news for all of us.  

1853
03:47:21,920 --> 03:47:30,000
I do not care about the marriage - there are 
plenty of other rich women. But all over Greece,  

1854
03:47:30,000 --> 03:47:34,640
people will say that we are weak 
compared to the great Odysseus.'

1855
03:47:36,160 --> 03:47:38,960
'Everything will be fine, Eurymachus,'  

1856
03:47:39,760 --> 03:47:48,000
said Antinous. 'Today is a public holiday 
- a day for fun, not for tests of strength.  

1857
03:47:49,199 --> 03:47:54,720
Let us leave the competition for now. 
Tomorrow we will pray to the god Apollo,  

1858
03:47:55,279 --> 03:48:02,639
whose skill with the bow is famous among gods 
and men. Then we will try our strength again.'

1859
03:48:04,160 --> 03:48:10,880
The other suitors liked this idea. But 
Odysseus stood up and said, 'Before you  

1860
03:48:10,880 --> 03:48:19,440
stop, could I try? I would like to see if there 
is any strength left in these old arms of mine.'

1861
03:48:20,479 --> 03:48:22,399
The suitors were very angry.  

1862
03:48:23,359 --> 03:48:28,160
They were frightened that the strange old 
man would succeed where they had failed.

1863
03:48:28,960 --> 03:48:31,840
'If you touch that bow, stranger,  

1864
03:48:32,720 --> 03:48:38,000
we will take you prisoner and sell you 
abroad,' said Antinous. 'We will...'

1865
03:48:38,000 --> 03:48:47,199
Penelope interrupted him. 'Antinous, stop. 
This poor stranger is our guest, and you must  

1866
03:48:47,199 --> 03:48:54,559
talk to him politely. He has no intention of 
becoming my husband. I am sure he knows that  

1867
03:48:54,560 --> 03:49:01,600
that is impossible. So let him try his strength 
against the rest of you. What harm could it do?'

1868
03:49:03,680 --> 03:49:11,279
It was Eurymachus who replied. 'The people 
will think badly of us if he succeeds. He is  

1869
03:49:11,279 --> 03:49:18,880
old and homeless, and we are the finest young 
men in Greece. Our reputations will be ruined!'

1870
03:49:19,840 --> 03:49:25,920
Penelope gave a little laugh. 'For 
years you have been eating and drinking,  

1871
03:49:25,920 --> 03:49:33,279
uninvited, at another man's table. Your 
reputations were ruined long ago, Eurymachus.'

1872
03:49:34,479 --> 03:49:42,399
'Mother,' said Telemachus, 'the bow was my 
father's, so now it is mine. I should choose  

1873
03:49:42,399 --> 03:49:49,439
who can hold it. But go now to your room and 
busy yourself with your work. Or sleep if you  

1874
03:49:49,439 --> 03:49:56,479
can - you look tired today. The competition to 
choose your husband will start again tomorrow.'

1875
03:49:58,160 --> 03:50:04,239
Penelope realized that Telemachus was right. 
She left the hall and returned to her bedroom.  

1876
03:50:05,359 --> 03:50:09,839
There, tired after her sleepless 
night, she fell asleep.

1877
03:50:14,160 --> 03:50:17,920
Telemachus now ordered Eumaeus 
to take the bow to Odysseus.  

1878
03:50:19,199 --> 03:50:26,479
The suitors shouted insults at the pig farmer, 
but Eumaeus did as Telemachus said. When he had  

1879
03:50:26,479 --> 03:50:34,080
given Odysseus the bow, he went up to the women's 
rooms and locked the doors. At the same time,  

1880
03:50:34,080 --> 03:50:40,880
Philoetius went out quietly and locked the palace 
gate. Now there was no escape for the suitors.

1881
03:50:42,720 --> 03:50:47,840
Odysseus was looking carefully at the bow, 
to see if the passing years had damaged it.  

1882
03:50:48,880 --> 03:50:51,680
When he was satisfied that 
it was as strong as before,  

1883
03:50:52,239 --> 03:50:58,719
he started to bend it. As easily as a bard strings 
his instrument before a musical performance,  

1884
03:50:59,279 --> 03:51:06,160
Odysseus bent the bow and put on the string. 
As the suitors looked at him angrily,  

1885
03:51:06,160 --> 03:51:12,479
they heard thunder outside. Odysseus smiled at 
this sign of support from the great god Zeus.

1886
03:51:13,920 --> 03:51:20,880
He picked up an arrow, aimed and 
shot. He did not miss a single  

1887
03:51:20,880 --> 03:51:26,560
ring. The arrow sped straight through 
from the first axe handle to the last.

1888
03:51:27,760 --> 03:51:35,520
Odysseus looked at Telemachus to check that he 
had his sword ready. Then he said, 'Suitors,  

1889
03:51:36,479 --> 03:51:43,120
I have won your competition. But now I am 
going to shoot something that no one has  

1890
03:51:43,120 --> 03:51:49,439
ever hit before.' From the doorway, 
he aimed an arrow at Antinous.

1891
03:51:50,640 --> 03:51:57,520
Antinous had just reached for his wine cup. 
He never imagined for one moment that anyone  

1892
03:51:57,520 --> 03:52:05,600
would try to kill him in the company of so many 
friends. The arrow hit him in the neck. The cup  

1893
03:52:05,600 --> 03:52:08,960
dropped from his hand and he 
fell to the floor with a crash.

1894
03:52:10,960 --> 03:52:19,040
The suitors stared at Antinous's dead body in 
shock. 'Stranger,' they shouted, you will pay  

1895
03:52:19,040 --> 03:52:25,439
for this accident with your blood.' Many of them 
were not carrying their swords, so they looked for  

1896
03:52:25,439 --> 03:52:33,439
the swords on the walls. Too late, they realized 
that the swords had disappeared. They still had  

1897
03:52:33,439 --> 03:52:39,839
no idea who the stranger was, and believed that 
Antinous's death had been a horrible mistake.

1898
03:52:40,720 --> 03:52:51,680
Odysseus cried, 'You dogs! You never thought 
that I would come back from Troy. So you stole my  

1899
03:52:51,680 --> 03:53:00,800
food. Then you tried to steal my wife and murder 
my son. For those crimes, you will all die.'

1900
03:53:02,800 --> 03:53:08,239
The suitors' faces turned white with fear, 
and they looked around for somewhere to hide.  

1901
03:53:09,439 --> 03:53:12,080
Only Eurymachus was brave enough to speak.  

1902
03:53:13,199 --> 03:53:17,760
'If you really are Odysseus, 
then you are right to be angry.  

1903
03:53:18,640 --> 03:53:26,080
But the person responsible for those crimes lies 
dead already. Antinous was power-hungry and cruel.  

1904
03:53:27,120 --> 03:53:36,080
He wanted to make himself King of Ithaca after 
killing your son - but he has paid the price.

1905
03:53:36,080 --> 03:53:40,880
The rest of us are guilty of nothing 
except eating your food without permission.  

1906
03:53:42,239 --> 03:53:48,239
For this we will each give you twenty 
cows and a generous repayment in gold.  

1907
03:53:49,439 --> 03:53:53,120
Think carefully, Odysseus, 
before you murder innocent men.'

1908
03:53:54,000 --> 03:54:04,080
'Eurymachus,' replied Odysseus, 'no amount of 
gold could pay for your crimes. You have only  

1909
03:54:04,080 --> 03:54:12,800
two choices - to fight or to run. But 
whatever you choose, you will soon be dead.'

1910
03:54:14,960 --> 03:54:17,840
Eurymachus called to the other suitors,  

1911
03:54:18,960 --> 03:54:26,080
'Odysseus will not be stopped with words. 
Get your swords ready, men. We must fight!'

1912
03:54:29,520 --> 03:54:36,319
Eurymachus ran at Odysseus with his sword, 
but Odysseus shot an arrow at his chest. He  

1913
03:54:36,319 --> 03:54:43,759
fell across the table, knocking food and wine cups 
everywhere before lying, dead, in a pool of blood.  

1914
03:54:45,439 --> 03:54:52,239
Amphinomus came straight after him. Telemachus 
killed him from behind as he ran at Odysseus.

1915
03:54:53,520 --> 03:54:59,840
'Father,' shouted Telemachus, 'I will go and 
get some swords for Eumaeus and Philoetius.'

1916
03:55:00,640 --> 03:55:07,360
'Yes,' replied Odysseus. 'But do it quickly. 
When I have no more arrows, I will need help.'

1917
03:55:08,960 --> 03:55:12,319
Telemachus got swords for the two loyal servants.  

1918
03:55:13,040 --> 03:55:20,640
Odysseus shot arrow after arrow, and each one 
brought death to a suitor. When there were no more  

1919
03:55:20,640 --> 03:55:25,600
arrows, he took his sword and fought 
with his son and servants at his side.

1920
03:55:26,640 --> 03:55:31,520
The suitors, with few swords between them, 
could do little to defend themselves.  

1921
03:55:32,560 --> 03:55:38,319
But Melanthius the farmer had an idea. 
'Telemachus must have the swords from  

1922
03:55:38,319 --> 03:55:44,799
the hall somewhere in the palace. I know the 
building well. I will go and look for them.'

1923
03:55:46,479 --> 03:55:53,519
He came back a few minutes later with an armful 
of swords. Then he went back to get more. With  

1924
03:55:53,520 --> 03:55:58,800
new confidence, the suitors threw themselves 
at Odysseus and his companions in the doorway.  

1925
03:55:59,760 --> 03:56:04,320
Suddenly, Odysseus felt less sure 
that they could win against so many.

1926
03:56:05,920 --> 03:56:12,239
'Where are they getting the swords from?' he asked 
his son. 'Who in the palace is helping them?'

1927
03:56:13,520 --> 03:56:21,279
'Look!' cried Eumaeus. 'Melanthius has a 
great pile of swords. He has found the room  

1928
03:56:21,279 --> 03:56:26,880
where they are hidden. He has given them 
to the suitors, and is going to get more.'

1929
03:56:28,640 --> 03:56:31,520
'Telemachus and I will keep 
the suitors in the hall,'  

1930
03:56:32,160 --> 03:56:37,840
Odysseus said to Eumaeus. 'Go now 
with Philoetius and stop Melanthius.'

1931
03:56:38,560 --> 03:56:42,560
Odysseus's loyal servants went in 
the same direction as Melanthius.  

1932
03:56:43,600 --> 03:56:47,121
They found him getting more swords 
from Telemachus's secret room.  

1933
03:56:47,920 --> 03:56:52,880
They jumped on him before he saw them and 
he was dead when they ran back to the hall.

1934
03:56:54,160 --> 03:56:59,599
The suitors were now fighting hard, but Odysseus 
and Telemachus had managed to keep them from the  

1935
03:56:59,600 --> 03:57:07,040
doorway. At this point, Athene came to them 
disguised as Odysseus's old friend Mentor.  

1936
03:57:08,720 --> 03:57:13,920
'Mentor!' cried Odysseus, guessing that 
he was really speaking to the goddess,  

1937
03:57:14,560 --> 03:57:18,400
you have come at just the right 
moment. Will you fight with us?'

1938
03:57:19,439 --> 03:57:23,120
'You were braver when you were 
fighting the Trojans' finest soldiers,'  

1939
03:57:23,680 --> 03:57:27,199
she replied. 'Now you are in your own home,  

1940
03:57:27,199 --> 03:57:34,080
against a group of lazy fools. You do 
not need me to fight with you, Odysseus.'

1941
03:57:34,080 --> 03:57:39,040
She changed into a bird and flew high 
above the men's heads to watch the fight.  

1942
03:57:40,319 --> 03:57:46,559
The suitors started to attack in groups of 
six. But Athene made sure that their swords  

1943
03:57:46,560 --> 03:57:52,480
could not hurt Odysseus and his companions. 
As their attacks failed again and again,  

1944
03:57:53,120 --> 03:57:58,559
the suitors' confidence left them. 
Finally, they ran to hide where they could.  

1945
03:57:59,600 --> 03:58:03,840
Odysseus and his men ran after 
them and cut them down without  

1946
03:58:03,840 --> 03:58:10,319
pity. The suitors screamed horribly as they 
died, and the floor was a lake of blood.

1947
03:58:12,080 --> 03:58:18,800
Phemius the bard looked around in terror. He felt 
sure that he was going to die with the suitors.  

1948
03:58:19,600 --> 03:58:23,121
But his only crime had been to 
entertain them with his songs.  

1949
03:58:24,080 --> 03:58:32,319
He ran to Odysseus and threw his arms around the 
hero's knees. 'Sir,' he cried, 'take pity on me.  

1950
03:58:33,040 --> 03:58:40,560
You will be sorry later if you kill a bard. My 
songs bring pleasure to both gods and men. Your  

1951
03:58:40,560 --> 03:58:47,200
son, Telemachus, can tell you - I did not choose 
to come here. I was forced here by the suitors.'

1952
03:58:48,080 --> 03:58:52,319
'It is true, Father,' said 
Telemachus. 'The man is innocent.'

1953
03:58:53,199 --> 03:58:59,679
'Then go outside to safety,' Odysseus said 
to Phemius. 'I have more work to do in here.'

1954
03:59:02,000 --> 03:59:08,720
When the bard had gone, Odysseus looked round 
the hall for more suitors to kill. But they were  

1955
03:59:08,720 --> 03:59:15,440
all piled on the floor on top of each 
other. No one was left alive.
 
 
 

1956
03:59:19,760 --> 03:59:20,560
CHAPTER TWELVE

1957
03:59:21,520 --> 03:59:23,200
Odysseus and Penelope

1958
03:59:24,640 --> 03:59:29,360
As she walked towards the hall, Penelope 
could not decide how to greet him.  

1959
03:59:30,319 --> 03:59:35,679
Should she be polite but cold, or should 
she run into his arms and kiss him?

1960
03:59:37,760 --> 03:59:39,840
Odysseus now said to Telemachus,  

1961
03:59:40,880 --> 03:59:46,640
'Go and fetch Eurycleia and the other 
servants. We must clean up the mess.'

1962
03:59:48,000 --> 03:59:54,080
The servants came out of their rooms and learnt 
what had happened. They threw their arms around  

1963
03:59:54,080 --> 04:00:01,359
Odysseus to welcome him home. He greeted each one 
by name, trying to keep the tears from his eyes.

1964
04:00:03,040 --> 04:00:08,160
When they had taken the suitors' bodies 
outside and washed away the blood in the hall,  

1965
04:00:08,160 --> 04:00:17,439
Odysseus said, 'Tomorrow I will visit my father. 
But now, Eurycleia, it is time to fetch Penelope.'

1966
04:00:18,479 --> 04:00:24,959
'Dear child,' replied the servant, you 
should first change your clothes. It is  

1967
04:00:24,960 --> 04:00:29,279
not right for the King of Ithaca to 
be dressed in dirty bits of cloth.'

1968
04:00:30,560 --> 04:00:39,040
'No,' said Odysseus, 'I have waited twenty years 
for this moment. I will not wait a minute longer.'

1969
04:00:40,640 --> 04:00:43,760
So Eurycleia hurried upstairs to wake Penelope.  

1970
04:00:44,640 --> 04:00:51,040
She almost fell over her own feet in her 
excitement to tell the news. 'Penelope,  

1971
04:00:51,040 --> 04:00:58,080
my dear, wake up!' she cried. 'Come and see the 
sight that you have prayed for all these years.  

1972
04:00:59,600 --> 04:01:04,480
Odysseus is home at last, and he has 
killed every one of the suitors.'

1973
04:01:05,520 --> 04:01:10,161
'Have the gods driven you mad, 
Eurycleia?' replied Penelope.

1974
04:01:10,800 --> 04:01:17,840
'Please, do not make fun of my unhappiness. Go 
back downstairs and let me sleep some more.'

1975
04:01:18,479 --> 04:01:23,199
'But I am not making fun of you, 
dear child,' the servant continued.

1976
04:01:24,000 --> 04:01:30,160
'Odysseus really has come home. He is the 
stranger who the suitors insulted in the hall.'

1977
04:01:31,359 --> 04:01:34,080
Penelope's heart jumped inside her chest.  

1978
04:01:34,960 --> 04:01:41,199
She rushed out of bed and held Eurycleia in 
her arms, with tears running down her face.

1979
04:01:42,640 --> 04:01:46,000
'Eurycleia, can it really be true?  

1980
04:01:46,000 --> 04:01:50,160
And how did he manage to kill all the 
suitors without an army to help him?'

1981
04:01:50,880 --> 04:01:57,279
'I did not see anything, and I was not told 
anything, but from my room I heard the cries  

1982
04:01:57,279 --> 04:02:03,279
of dying men. Then Telemachus called me 
and the other servants into the hall,  

1983
04:02:04,080 --> 04:02:07,199
and we saw Odysseus standing 
among the dead bodies.  

1984
04:02:08,080 --> 04:02:15,040
We have cleaned up the mess, and now Odysseus 
wants to see you. Come now and welcome him home.'

1985
04:02:16,080 --> 04:02:23,519
'You believe too easily, dear Eurycleia. There is 
something strange about this story. I feel sure  

1986
04:02:23,520 --> 04:02:28,800
that the gods are trying to trick us. Perhaps 
the man in the hall is a god in disguise.'

1987
04:02:30,319 --> 04:02:35,840
'But I saw his scar - you know, the 
one that he got in a hunting accident.'

1988
04:02:37,120 --> 04:02:44,319
'Eurycleia, you are a wise woman, but even you 
cannot see into the hearts and minds of the gods.  

1989
04:02:45,600 --> 04:02:51,840
But come, I am glad that the suitors are 
dead. I will talk to the man who killed them.'

1990
04:02:53,520 --> 04:02:58,240
As she walked towards the hall, Penelope 
could not decide how to greet him.  

1991
04:02:59,439 --> 04:03:04,559
Should she be polite but cold, or should 
she run into his arms and kiss him?  

1992
04:03:06,080 --> 04:03:10,960
When she saw the man by the fire, she 
just stared at his face in confusion.  

1993
04:03:12,239 --> 04:03:19,199
At times she saw her husband's face there, but 
at other times he looked to her like a stranger.

1994
04:03:20,560 --> 04:03:26,081
'Mother,' said Telemachus crossly, 'why 
are you not welcoming my father home?'

1995
04:03:27,279 --> 04:03:34,479
'I am sorry, my son,' she replied. 'The 
shock has turned my tongue to stone.  

1996
04:03:35,760 --> 04:03:37,840
I cannot say a word to him.'

1997
04:03:38,640 --> 04:03:46,480
Odysseus now said, 'Telemachus, I need to wash, 
and then your mother and I need some time alone.  

1998
04:03:47,600 --> 04:03:54,161
Go and organize a dance for the servants. 
And do not worry. Everything will be fine.'

1999
04:03:56,399 --> 04:03:59,279
While Telemachus asked Phemius for some music,  

2000
04:04:00,160 --> 04:04:03,680
Odysseus had a bath and put 
on some fine new clothes.  

2001
04:04:05,040 --> 04:04:11,519
Then Athene worked her magic on his appearance, 
giving him a younger face and a stronger body.  

2002
04:04:12,800 --> 04:04:16,880
When he went back to Penelope in 
the hall, he looked like a god.

2003
04:04:18,239 --> 04:04:21,679
'Well, Penelope, you are a strange woman.  

2004
04:04:22,640 --> 04:04:30,161
Few wives would stay out of their husbands' arms 
for as long as this. But I can wait. Eurycleia,  

2005
04:04:30,880 --> 04:04:36,720
please prepare a bed for me somewhere in the 
palace. I will be sleeping alone tonight.'

2006
04:04:37,760 --> 04:04:45,760
'You seem a strange man to me too. All these 
years I have carried a picture of you in my head.  

2007
04:04:46,880 --> 04:04:54,560
But you do not look like that picture. Come, 
Eurycleia, we must move the great bed that  

2008
04:04:54,560 --> 04:05:00,480
Odysseus himself built. Take it outside the 
bedroom and make it comfortable for him.'

2009
04:05:01,680 --> 04:05:08,320
This was Penelope's test for the man in 
front of her. He replied angrily, 'Lady,  

2010
04:05:09,279 --> 04:05:16,719
your words are like a knife in my heart. What 
have you done to our bed? I built it myself,  

2011
04:05:17,439 --> 04:05:21,599
using a tree that was growing in 
the palace as one of the bed's legs.

2012
04:05:22,399 --> 04:05:28,000
No one can move it - unless you have cut 
through the wood of the tree and destroyed it.'

2013
04:05:29,439 --> 04:05:35,839
At these words, Penelope's knees began 
to shake. No one knew the secret of  

2014
04:05:35,840 --> 04:05:41,120
the tree-bed except her husband and a 
servant who had died many years before.

2015
04:05:42,319 --> 04:05:48,799
'Do not be angry with me, Odysseus,' she 
cried. 'The bed is exactly as you left it.  

2016
04:05:49,680 --> 04:05:53,760
But I was so frightened that someone 
would come here pretending to be you.  

2017
04:05:54,880 --> 04:06:01,520
This was my test - and now I 
know. Husband, it is really you!'

2018
04:06:03,199 --> 04:06:07,679
She threw her arms around 
him. She was like a sailor  

2019
04:06:07,680 --> 04:06:14,720
whose ship has been destroyed in a storm. 
After swimming for many hours, he sees dry land  

2020
04:06:15,279 --> 04:06:21,120
and knows that he is saved. Penelope felt 
the same way about seeing her husband again.  

2021
04:06:22,239 --> 04:06:26,559
For a long time Odysseus and Penelope 
held each other, crying silently.

2022
04:06:27,840 --> 04:06:33,040
When everyone else in the palace had gone 
to bed, Odysseus finally broke the silence.  

2023
04:06:34,160 --> 04:06:41,040
'Dear wife, we have not yet come to the 
end of our troubles. On my journey home,  

2024
04:06:41,680 --> 04:06:44,000
I spoke with the prophet Teiresias.  

2025
04:06:44,960 --> 04:06:50,000
He told me that I had to make another long 
journey before I could enjoy a peaceful old age.'

2026
04:06:51,439 --> 04:06:58,000
Penelope questioned her husband about the details 
of this prophecy. 'If the gods have promised you  

2027
04:06:58,000 --> 04:07:05,439
a more peaceful old age,' she said finally, 'then 
there is hope that one day our troubles will end.'

2028
04:07:06,640 --> 04:07:12,161
Odysseus smiled at her words. 
Then he took his dear wife  to their bed.

2029
04:07:13,040 --> 04:07:16,800
- THE END -
