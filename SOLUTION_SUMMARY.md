# Solution Summary: Vocabulary Enrichment System

## 🎯 Problem Statement (Turkish)

> Bu ve buna benzer kelimelerin sadece mantıklı olan 1 tanesini kullan, bunlar quiz typing sorularında soruluyor, a.m./A.M./am/AM.
>
> Aslında bu bir sözlük yapısıda taşıyor ama tam sözlükte sayılmaz aynı zamanda, bu yüzden çok fazla zengin içeriğe sahip olmalı, öyle yüzeysel olmaz, lütfen bunu çok zenginleştir.

**Translation**: Use only ONE logical form of words like a.m./A.M./am/AM in quiz typing questions. This should have a dictionary-like structure but not be a full dictionary - it needs to be very rich in content, not superficial. Please enrich this significantly.
