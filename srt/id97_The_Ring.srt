CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,240
The Madman on the Beach

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,680
When I saw Rafael for the first 
time, I was twelve years old.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,840
My family lived in a big 
town, far away from the sea.  

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,640
But my Uncle Miguel and his family 
lived in a little village on the coast.  

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,160
He had a cafe and a small farm there, 
and sometimes my family visited him.

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:44,320
There in that village I met poor, mad 
Rafael. I didn't know then who he was.  

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,400
I didn't know why he was mad. I knew 
nothing of his strange and terrible story.  

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:02,400
Now, fourteen years later, I know exactly 
what happened. But Rafael is dead.  

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:12,160
Why should I tell people his terrible 
secret? Only I know what happened to Rafael.  

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:20,880
Only I know what happened to the young and 
beautiful Anita. And to the soldier. Only I.

12
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,680
The people in the village told me what they 
knew. Their stories were all true. Every word.  

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,200
My uncle, his wife, Rodrigo the 
shopkeeper - nobody lied to me. Nobody.  

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,040
Not even poor Clara, Rafael's mother. And she 
was already dead when I went back to the village.  

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,840
Their stories were all true. But they 
didn't know what really happened.

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:02,800
The first time I saw Rafael, I was walking along 
the beach with my younger brother Pablo. Our  

17
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:09,040
parents were talking with my uncle and his family. 
We boys went along the beach to look around.

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,880
At the end of the beach there were high black 
rocks, where the mountains behind the village  

19
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:25,760
came down into the sea. Near them was an old 
wooden boat-house. It had no doors. The roof  

20
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,480
was broken at one end, and open to the sky. 
Inside there was an old wooden fishing boat.

21
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:42,080
My brother and I looked inside. The sand 
was deep and soft on the floor. Suddenly,  

22
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,120
in a corner behind the boat, 
something moved in the shadows.  

23
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,360
It was a dirty young man with long hair 
and a beard. He stood up and looked at us.  

24
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:05,680
His eyes were open, but empty. He looked at 
us, but he didn't see us. He was very thin.

25
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,280
He put one hand to his neck. I saw 
something shining under the dark beard.  

26
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,000
There was something small and bright 
on a thin fishing line round his  

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,840
neck. He pulled it out to show us. It was 
a small gold ring in the shape of a fish.

28
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,600
Suddenly he spoke. His voice was clear,  

29
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,040
but thin and high. He spoke words, 
but they didn't mean anything.

30
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,920
'She gave me the golden fish,' he 
said. 'She gave it back to me.'

31
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,680
Then he laughed. And when he laughed, 
my brother and I were very afraid.  

32
00:03:52,880 --> 00:04:00,640
He laughed and laughed, but his eyes were 
big and sad. We ran out of the boat-house.  

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,520
The thin young man came out behind us. 
He stood in the sunshine and laughed.

34
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,840
'She gave me the ring,' he 
shouted. 'I still have it.'

35
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:21,680
Some little boys from the village came running. 
Some of them threw stones at the thin, dirty man.

36
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,840
'Crazy Rafael!' they shouted. Crazy Rafael!'

37
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,680
He stopped laughing and screamed at them.  

38
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,080
Then he went back inside the boat-house. 
The children laughed and ran away.

39
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,840
We went back to my uncle's house.

40
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,840
'Who is that crazy man on the beach?' we 
asked. 'The children called him Rafael.'

41
00:04:51,760 --> 00:05:00,640
'He's only a poor, mad young man,' said my uncle. 
'He isn't dangerous. He went mad about a year ago.  

42
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,640
We don't know why. Nobody can help him. I'm 
afraid. His mother lives in the house at the end  

43
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:15,840
of the village. She brings him food every day. All 
the people in the village help her when they can.'

44
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:26,480
Soon the adults began to talk about other things. 
But I never forgot poor, mad Rafael. Every time  

45
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,400
I thought about the village, I remembered the 
poor, mad man in the boat-house on the beach.  

46
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:42,000
Sometimes I saw him in my dreams. He looked at me 
with his big, empty, mad eyes. He called to me.  

47
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:52,280
He had the gold ring round his neck, and he 
held it out to me. He called for me to help him.

48
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
***

49
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,320
My family went back to the town. After I left 
school, I went to university in the capital.  

50
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,160
I studied to be a doctor. I 
spent two years in the USA.  

51
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,080
Finally, I came back to my home town and 
I found work in a big, new hospital there.

52
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,840
In all those years, I never 
went back to the village.  

53
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,960
But then one of my uncle's sons got married 
and all my family went there for a few days.

54
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:35,280
There were many changes in the village. Twelve 
years of change. There were new stone houses.  

55
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,880
There were new, brightly-painted fishing boats 
along the beach, a lot of them with engines.  

56
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,160
My uncle had a big, clean, new cafe with tables 
and chairs, and a television in the corner.  

57
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,800
It was all very different from 
the village that I saw as a boy.

58
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,480
I went down to the beach on my 
first afternoon in the village.  

59
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:08,400
I wanted to see again the place where I first saw 
Rafael. I couldn't believe it. The old boat-house  

60
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,640
and the boat were still there. The boat 
was in pieces now, but the boat-house was  

61
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,280
bigger and stronger. There was some new 
wood on the walls and a new roof on it.

62
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,880
I walked along the beach and felt the soft 
sand under my town shoes. There was a man  

63
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:37,760
sitting near the old boat-house. He was looking 
at the sea. He had long hair and long, thin legs.  

64
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,840
I came closer and he suddenly looked round at me.  

65
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:53,040
It was Rafael. I saw again those same wide, 
crazy, sad eyes, the eyes from my dreams.

66
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:02,000
He was twelve years older. His hair and beard were 
beginning to go grey, but they weren't as long and  

67
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,840
dirty as before. His face was very thin and he 
looked ill. His clothes were old, but clean.

68
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,960
'How are you, Rafael?' I called, smiling.

69
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,200
He put his head on one side and looked at me.  

70
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,720
His mouth opened and he smiled. A 
thin brown hand moved up to his neck.

71
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:41,680
'She gave me the golden fish,' he said. His voice 
was flat and empty. He coughed suddenly - a deep,  

72
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,920
dry cough. Then he looked with sad 
yellow eyes at the bright, empty sea.

73
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,680
I went back across the soft white sand to 
my uncle's house I had an idea in my head.  

74
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,120
I was a doctor now. Perhaps I could find 
out what was the matter with this poor man.  

75
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,000
I could give him the best help that 
modern medicine could give him.

76
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
I told my uncle what I wanted to do.  

77
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,840
'There are special hospitals now in the capital 
for people like Rafael. I can take him there.  

78
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:31,520
If I can make him well, I will. If not, he can 
stay in a hospital there. He will have a bed,  

79
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,000
good food, nurses all the time. It's not good 
for him to sleep on the beach. He looks ill.'

80
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,080
I asked him to tell me about Rafael. 
He told me everything that he knew.  

81
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,560
It was a long and strange story. 
I wrote it all in a notebook.  

82
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:03,840
I wanted to help the poor madman to get well. 
For this, I had to know everything about him.
 
 
 

83
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,880
CHAPTER TWO

84
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,040
Rafael's Father and the Sharks

85
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
Told by my uncle
 
 

86
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,320
Rafael was born in the village (my uncle said).

87
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,000
His father was called Manuel 
and he was a fisherman.  

88
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,880
His mother, Clara, is also dead now. 
She was the sister of my own wife, Rosa.  

89
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:46,160
Rafael was their only child. He was a fine boy, 
never ill, good-looking, healthy and strong.

90
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:53,040
When he was about eight years old, his father was 
killed. It was a terrible thing for the young boy.  

91
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,920
He was there and saw his father die. They were 
out in their boat, fishing with some other men  

92
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,320
from the village. I don't know what happened 
exactly. Something happened to the fishing nets;  

93
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,600
perhaps they were caught under the boat. Manuel 
went into the water to do something with them.

94
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,600
Suddenly a shark attacked him. It was a 
complete surprise. The other fishermen  

95
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,760
could do nothing to help him. It was a big 
white shark. It came up from deep water  

96
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,400
and bit off one of Manuel's legs 
- a clean bite above the knee.

97
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:42,880
The other men pulled him into the boat. The blood 
from his leg ran deep in the bottom of the boat.  

98
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,960
The men put a shirt round the top of his leg. They 
tried to stop the blood, but it was impossible.  

99
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,960
They say that Manuel was calm 
at first. He felt no pain.  

100
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,560
He smoked a cigarette and he talked to 
little Rafael, in the boat next to him.

101
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,880
But after a few minutes he went very 
white. Then he began to feel very cold.  

102
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,640
The men covered him with their clothes to keep 
him warm. But he became very weak and sleepy.

103
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,840
Suddenly he put his hand on Rafael's head.

104
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:34,080
'Be a good son,' he said. His voice 
was terribly tired. 'Help your mother.'  

105
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,480
Then he fell asleep, and in a 
few minutes his heart stopped.

106
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,880
After that, Rafael and his mother, Clara, lived 
alone in their house at the end of the village.  

107
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,000
Manuel's brother, Ricardo, helped Clara with 
money. All the people in the village helped her.  

108
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,160
Manuel was a good man. We always 
help our people when they need it.  

109
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,680
In a few years Rafael was older and 
started to work. He became a fisherman,  

110
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,680
too. He and his mother were poor, but he 
could earn enough money for them both.

111
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,800
Rafael was a fine boy. He became a good 
fisherman. But he always hated sharks,  

112
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:31,600
because of what happened to his father. Every 
few months, he did something very strange.  

113
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,160
When anyone in the village 
killed an animal for meat,  

114
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:45,360
Rafael asked them for the skin and the stomach. He 
took the insides of the animal that nobody wanted.  

115
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:55,360
Then he went out in his boat alone, far from 
the land. There he threw the pieces of the  

116
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,480
animal into the sea and waited for the sharks 
to come. A shark can smell blood in the water  

117
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:09,200
when it is many kilometres away. Soon a lot 
of sharks arrived in the water round his boat.  

118
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:18,000
Then Rafael took his fishing spear. He stood 
up in his boat and killed one or two of them.

119
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,160
When he killed a shark, the other sharks tasted 
the blood. They began to bite and eat the shark.  

120
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:35,840
So then there was more blood in the water and more 
sharks came. Rafael killed more and more. After an  

121
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:43,840
hour he was almost too tired to stand. It was 
a really dangerous thing to do in a small boat.

122
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
But he was smiling when he told me about it.  

123
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,080
He was really happy about the dead 
sharks, because a shark killed his father.

124
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:03,760
So Rafael grew up, tall, strong and good-looking. 
And, of course, he fell in love with Anita,  

125
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,640
the shopkeeper's daughter. So now (said my 
uncle), I have to tell you about Anita, too.
 
 
 

126
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,280
CHAPTER THREE

127
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,280
Anita, the Shopkeeper's Daughter

128
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,240
Told by my uncle
 
 

129
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:33,280
Anita was a beautiful child (my uncle 
continued). I know, most children are beautiful.  

130
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:42,480
But she was the most beautiful child that I've 
ever seen. Everyone loved her. Little children,  

131
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,920
old people, men and women, they all loved 
Anita. They smiled when they saw her.  

132
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,800
And year after year she grew up, and 
year after year she grew more beautiful.

133
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,280
Her father, Rodrigo, the shopkeeper, loved her 
most. He tried to keep her close to him, always.  

134
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,440
She could never go out and 
talk with the village boys.  

135
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,600
But this is a small village. It was 
impossible to keep her at home all the time.  

136
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,440
She was a good girl, but all the young men 
dreamed of her and wanted to marry her.

137
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,720
She was not only beautiful. She was clever, too.  

138
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,320
Her father could read and write. Most 
of the people in the village couldn't.  

139
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,480
We had no school in the village in those days. 
So Rodrigo taught Anita to read and write.  

140
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,360
He often went into the town 
to buy things for his shop.  

141
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,560
Then he brought back picture magazines 
and small story books for her.

142
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,800
Anita was very good at reading and telling 
stories. She remembered everything that she read.  

143
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,560
When she was only nine or ten, she often 
sat near the house under a tree with a book.  

144
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:16,320
There she read or told stories to her little 
brothers and sisters. Soon the other children  

145
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:22,240
of the village came and sat round her. 
Some of the fishermen, old and young,  

146
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:29,280
sat on the beach near the shop, too. They liked to 
listen to little Anita when she told her stories.

147
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:38,960
Of course, Rodrigo had big plans for Anita. 
He was so proud of her. He wanted her to marry  

148
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,840
someone rich and important. Perhaps a man from 
the city, who was able to help Rodrigo's business.  

149
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,600
Everyone knew one thing for sure. He didn't 
want Anita to marry anyone from the village.

150
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,040
Rafael loved her very much. 
They say Anita loved him, too.  

151
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,400
But there was no hope for him. Rodrigo didn't 
want a poor fisherman to be Anita's husband.

152
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:20,720
Poor Rodrigo. He loved Anita and he had great 
hopes for her. When she ran away, it was terrible  

153
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:29,840
for him. He still doesn't talk about it. Not a 
word. Not after all these years. For him, he says,

154
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,720
Anita is dead. He has no daughter of that name.

155
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
***

156
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:45,760
'But where did she go?' I asked my uncle. 
'Someone knows. And why is Rafael mad?  

157
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,400
Not because Anita ran away from home. 
She didn't run away with him, did she?'

158
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:01,920
'No, she didn't,' answered my uncle. 'That's 
for sure. Nobody knows where she went.  

159
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,840
But Rafael stayed in the village. And 
that was the time when he went mad.  

160
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:16,880
I believe that Anita ran away with the 
soldier. I think they're married. They're  

161
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,840
probably living in another town, far away. But 
that's only my opinion. I don't really know.'

162
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:32,240
'The soldier? What soldier?' I asked. 
My uncle smiled and looked at his watch.

163
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,840
'It's a long and strange story,' he said.
 
 
 

164
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,760
CHAPTER FOUR

165
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,080
The Soldier

166
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,480
Told by my uncle
 
 

167
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,640
The soldier (said my uncle) came to the village 
about three months before Anita ran away.  

168
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,840
She was sixteen years old 
then, and Rafael was eighteen.

169
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,840
The soldier was a strange man.  

170
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,760
His real name was Carlos, but everyone called 
him 'the soldier'. He told us about his life.

171
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,720
'I've been a soldier all my life,' he 
told us. 'I was in Cuba for six years.  

172
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,960
Then I fought in Africa and many other 
places. I've seen the world, my friends.'

173
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,840
He had a thousand stories. But 
nobody ever knew where he came from.  

174
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:45,120
He was Very handsome, with bright eyes and 
long, dark hair. He was a soldier, a sailor,  

175
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:52,640
a fisherman - everything. He had a small boat 
with an engine. That was unusual in those days.  

176
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,040
He worked for nobody. He went where he 
wanted to. He did what he wanted to.  

177
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,280
He bought things and sold things. He could 
get anything that you wanted, for a price.

178
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,720
He sailed into our village late one afternoon. 
He anchored his boat a few metres from the shore  

179
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,800
and walked up the beach. I never knew what he came 
for. It was just a small thing that he wanted,  

180
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:30,560
probably. First he went to Rodrigo's shop. Then 
he came to my cafe and sat for an hour and talked.  

181
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,760
And there he saw Anita, sitting 
by the corner of the shop.  

182
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,440
The children were all round her on the 
ground and she was telling them a story.

183
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,640
He sat outside the cafe and talked for 
an hour or more about this and that.  

184
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,360
But his eyes never went far from 
the little group of children.

185
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,600
At last he asked me: 'Is that 
girl your schoolteacher?'

186
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,200
I laughed and said: 'No, she's 
just the shopkeeper's daughter.  

187
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,640
She's only sixteen. She's 
not much older than a child.'

188
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,200
He left the village late in the afternoon  

189
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,440
before it got dark. He walked through 
the water to his boat and climbed in.  

190
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,840
We watched him start the engine. The boat moved 
away round the rocks at the end of the beach.  

191
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,280
Everyone in the village stopped what they 
were doing. Anita, too, stopped in her story.  

192
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,840
Everyone watched the strange thing 
- a boat that went without a sail.

193
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,600
Of course, he came back. I told 
you, no man could ever forget Anita.  

194
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,200
A week or two later his boat arrived again and 
the good-looking stranger went to Rodrigo's shop.  

195
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,200
He bought a few things and talked 
with Rodrigo. Then he came to the  

196
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,840
cafe again. He had a drink and a talk with 
me. Then he went off again along the coast.

197
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,080
Soon he came twice a week, on Thursdays 
and Sundays. He made friends with the  

198
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,000
people of the village. He was exciting and 
amusing. He was different from the people  

199
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,560
of the village. He was a stranger, but 
everyone seemed to like him. We listened  

200
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,920
to the stories about his travels 
and his life in other countries.  

201
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,520
He always spent an hour or two at my cafe. He 
sat and drank with us and told funny stories.  

202
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,200
Many of the fishermen came to the cafe when he 
was there. I liked him, the other men did, too.

203
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,280
He often brought little presents for people. 
He brought me a little cassette player one day.  

204
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,120
It was something new for us. We had 
no electricity in the village then,  

205
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:09,440
and we knew very little about the outside world. 
He showed me how it worked. Then he brought me new  

206
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,760
batteries for it every two weeks. He gave me some 
cassettes for it, too, of music from the cities,  

207
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,920
dance music from Latin America, 
and Mexican love songs.

208
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,920
'A cafe must have music,' he said, 
'music for the customers to enjoy.'

209
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,720
After that I kept the little 
cassette player on the bar.  

210
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,840
Every time the soldier came to the 
cafe, I played some music for him.  

211
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,760
When the cafe was busy, I played music 
for the people of the village, too.

212
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:51,760
He brought a paraffin lamp for Rodrigo to put in 
his shop. It was a very bright light. No house in  

213
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,840
the village had a light like it. The soldier 
was becoming very good friends with Rodrigo.

214
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:08,240
Then early one Monday morning, we heard a terrible 
noise from Rodrigo's house. He was shouting,  

215
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,720
his wife was screaming, and the children were 
all crying. It seems Anita wasn't in the house.  

216
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:22,960
Her bed was cold and empty. There was no note from 
her, not a word. Rodrigo wanted to get the police.

217
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,240
'Somebody has stolen my daughter,' he said.  

218
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,400
'Somebody has taken her away 
in the night, dead or alive.'

219
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:41,760
But then they found that her little box was empty. 
Anita's best clothes and favourite things weren't  

220
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:49,920
there. Even her little story books were gone. So 
Rodrigo stopped talking about bringing the police.  

221
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:58,720
For a few days he was terribly angry. He spoke 
wildly and fought with everyone. Nobody could  

222
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:07,520
speak to him. Then, suddenly, he seemed to cut 
her out of his life. He never spoke her name  

223
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:15,040
again. He still doesn't talk about her. Only a 
brave man speaks Anita's name in front of him.

224
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,800
We never saw the soldier again. He was 
here on the Sunday afternoon and evening.  

225
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,680
He usually was. He spent most of the 
evening in the cafe, listening to the music.  

226
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,520
Then he left at about ten o'clock. 
I watched him go out to his boat.  

227
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,720
It was dark. There was no moon. But I heard 
him start his engine and go off to the west.  

228
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,320
And the next morning Anita was gone. And 
we never saw her or the soldier again.

229
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,880
So I - and most people in the village - 
believe that she ran away with the soldier.  

230
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,440
Nobody knows how they did it. We never saw him 
talk to her for a minute in the village. I think  

231
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,200
he waited for her in his boat along the coast. 
And she went to him in the middle of the night.  

232
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,960
Most of us believe they are living together 
somewhere. Maybe with their own children now.

233
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
***

234
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,440
'But why did Rafael go mad?' I asked my uncle.

235
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,840
'Who knows?' he replied. 'Perhaps 
he went mad because he loved Anita.  

236
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:43,600
Then she ran away with the soldier. Who can say? 
He did love the girl very much. I knew it, and  

237
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,960
his mother did, too. But marriage was impossible 
because Rafael was a poor, fatherless fisherman.'

238
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,680
'But a man doesn't go mad for thirteen years 
because a girl runs away from home,' I said.  

239
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:07,840
'Men often lose their wives, their children. 
People die in accidents. This doesn't make other  

240
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:15,840
people crazy. Rodrigo lost his favourite daughter, 
the light of his life, but he didn't go mad.'

241
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:24,800
'Who can say?' said my uncle again. 'Who knows 
why things happen? Why does a man go mad?  

242
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,080
We know that Rafael was in love with 
Anita. He loved her for a long time  

243
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,760
before the soldier came to the village. 
We know that because of the gold ring.'

244
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,800
'Ah, yes,' I said. 'Tell me about the gold 
ring that Rafael wears round his neck.  

245
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,960
It's clearly a very important 
part of the story.'
 
 
 

246
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,320
CHAPTER FIVE

247
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,720
The Gold Ring

248
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,720
Told by my uncle
 
 

249
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:09,440
Rafael (said my uncle) was in love with 
Anita. He wanted to marry Anita when  

250
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,840
she was only fifteen or sixteen. His mother 
went to see Rodrigo to talk to him about it.  

251
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,840
I heard that Rodrigo was very polite to her.

252
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,880
'I'm sorry,' he said. 'Anita is going 
to marry a rich businessman in the city.  

253
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:34,800
He's a very rich man and a friend of our 
family. Your son Rafael is a fine boy.  

254
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,720
But he's too young to get married. And he 
has nothing to give her. Nothing at all.'

255
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,760
Rafael was very sad when he heard 
about Anita and the businessman.  

256
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,840
Then, after a few weeks, he suddenly left the 
village and went to the port on the coast.

257
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,560
'I'm going to find work in the 
port,' he said to his mother.  

258
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,200
'I want to see something of the world outside 
this village. I'll come back in a month or two.'

259
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,840
He put his few things in his boat and 
sailed along the coast to the port.  

260
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,520
It was six months before we saw him again.

261
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,680
***

262
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:23,280
'Six months? What did he do there 
for six months?' I asked my uncle.

263
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:34,160
'You're lucky,' he replied. 'I can tell you. 
Rafael came to the cafe one evening. There were no  

264
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:41,200
other customers that night, and he told me about 
his time in the port. This is what he told me.'

265
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
***

266
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:51,040
Rafael stayed in the port all the time (my 
uncle said). He slept in his boat on the beach.  

267
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,240
Sometimes he bought fruit and vegetables 
from the market after it closed.  

268
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:04,320
They were very cheap then. He worked for anyone. 
He did anything. He carried things for people.  

269
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,560
He loaded and unloaded boats and lorries. Every 
morning, very early, he went fishing. Then he  

270
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:19,920
sold the fish on the beach before he started work. 
Slowly, very slowly, he began to save some money.

271
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:30,480
Rafael met an old goldsmith in the town. He was a 
good old man. Rafael helped the goldsmith when he  

272
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,760
could. He cleaned his shop for him and brought 
packages and messages for him. He talked to him  

273
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:45,840
and made coffee for him. He watched him while 
he was working. Soon he became a good friend.

274
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,680
Rafael never took any money from 
the old man. He never asked for any.

275
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,000
Then, one day, the goldsmith 
asked Rafael what he wanted.  

276
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,880
He knew he wanted something. And Rafael told him.

277
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:14,160
'I want a gold ring for a girl in my village,' 
he said. 'It must be in the shape of a fish,  

278
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:21,920
a long fish with its tail in its mouth. How 
much will this ring cost? I have some money.  

279
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,840
I know it's not enough. But I'll 
work for you until I've paid for it.'

280
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,120
The old goldsmith made the ring for him.  

281
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:42,080
I'm sure Rafael paid much less than its real cost. 
But it took six months of hard work to pay for it.

282
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,960
Soon after Rafael came back to the village, 
he went with his mother to see Rodrigo.  

283
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,480
This time Rafael spoke for himself.

284
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:59,360
'Senor Rodrigo,' he said quietly. 'My 
father is dead and my mother is poor.  

285
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,240
But I'm hard-working and honest and 
I'll be a good husband to Anita.  

286
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,520
One day I'll be a rich man, like your 
friend in the city. But I'll be a better  

287
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,240
husband to Anita than the businessman, 
because I love her with all my heart.'

288
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,320
Then he gave the gold ring to 
Rodrigo as a present for Anita.

289
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,200
Of course, Rodrigo didn't agree to 
a marriage between Anita and Rafael.  

290
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
He gave the ring back to Rafael.

291
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,320
'I'm sorry,' he said. 'But Anita will 
marry the businessman in a year or two.  

292
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,800
That is decided and I am not 
going to change my plans.'

293
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,840
***

294
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,440
'So Anita never got the ring,' I said to my uncle.  

295
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,600
'After all that work and time, 
he couldn't give it to her.'

296
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:05,840
'He still has it on a piece of fishing 
line round his neck,' my uncle said.

297
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,600
'And when did the soldier come to 
the village for the first time?'

298
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,880
'A few months after Rafael came back from 
the port, perhaps. I can't remember exactly.'

299
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,400
'But Rafael wasn't mad at that time?'

300
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,040
'Oh, no. Not at all. In 
fact he seemed very happy.'

301
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,040
'Tell me about the time when he went mad.  

302
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,880
Was it the same time exactly when Anita 
went away with the soldier, or later?'

303
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,720
'It's difficult to remember. A lot 
of things happened at that time.'

304
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,280
'What do you mean? What kind of things happened?'

305
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,520
'Oh, little things, strange things. 
Santiago's old donkey disappeared.'

306
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,800
'What do you mean - it disappeared?'

307
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:05,280
'It did - it went. It disappeared. One day it 
was in the field behind his house. The next  

308
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,800
day it wasn't there. Perhaps Anita stole it to 
ride on. But everyone knew Santiago's donkey.  

309
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,360
It was too old and weak to walk a hundred 
metres. It couldn't carry a girl.'

310
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,960
'What other strange things happened?'

311
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,840
'I remember that on that 
last night, Rafael danced.'

312
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,600
'Danced?'

313
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,320
'Yes, he danced for hours, 
alone, here in the cafe.  

314
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,600
He never danced before, not in the cafe 
or anywhere. Or I never saw him dance.  

315
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:57,840
And, of course, he never danced again, because he 
went crazy. But I must start at the beginning.'
 
 
 

316
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,680
CHAPTER SIX

317
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,280
The Night When Rafael Danced

318
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,680
Told by my uncle
 
 

319
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:15,840
It was a Sunday (said my uncle). The soldier 
arrived in his boat in the early afternoon,  

320
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,680
when everything was quiet. He lowered his 
anchor a few metres from the shore, as usual,  

321
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,040
and walked up the sand to the houses. He never 
pulled his boat up on to the beach. It was a  

322
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,840
heavy boat and he didn't want to break the engine. 
He always left it in about one metre of water.

323
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,920
That day he came first to the cafe. He sat 
and talked with me and some of the men.  

324
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,760
We all sat outside the cafe 
and listened to his stories.

325
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:55,520
Then, later in the afternoon, he went to 
Rodrigo's shop and bought a few things.  

326
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,400
He had a big can of paraffin in the boat 
for Rodrigo's new lamp. I saw him give it  

327
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:09,200
to him. The soldier and Rodrigo sat and talked and 
drank coffee outside the shop for about an hour.

328
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:18,640
When it got dark, he went with Rodrigo into the 
house behind the shop. I could see the bright  

329
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,240
light from the lamp through the window. 
Then the soldier had a meal with Rodrigo.

330
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,960
After the meal, he came back to the cafe  

331
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:36,160
and sat with me and some of the fishermen. 
It was very dark and we sat inside.  

332
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:42,320
The soldier seemed very happy. He told us a lot 
of funny stories about his life as a soldier.

333
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,840
Then, at about nine o'clock, 
Rafael came into the cafe.

334
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,520
We were surprised to see him, because Rafael 
didn't spend a lot of time at the cafe.  

335
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,440
And he never came into the cafe 
when the soldier was there.  

336
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:08,480
That night he was wearing his best clothes. 
Usually he wore his old clothes, even in the cafe.  

337
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,880
He was wearing his best shirt and 
trousers. His face and hands were  

338
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:21,280
very clean, and his hair was still wet 
and shiny from washing. I asked myself:  

339
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,240
'Is he trying to show the soldier that 
he is not just a poor fisherman?' 

340
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:35,040
The soldier knew Rafael. He knew that he wanted 
to marry Anita. Everyone in the village talked  

341
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:41,360
about it. Rafael knew that the soldier was 
also interested in her. Everyone in the  

342
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:48,000
village talked about that, too. But nobody knew 
the secret game that the soldier was playing.

343
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,080
Rafael and the soldier didn't speak. 
The cafe was quiet. Nobody spoke.

344
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,720
Suddenly the soldier took 
a cassette from his pocket.

345
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,040
'Let's have some music,' he 
said, giving me the cassette.

346
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,480
I took it and put it into the player. I 
remember it was a love song. It was sung  

347
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,840
by a girl with a soft and beautiful 
voice. We all sat and listened to it.

348
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Rafael smiled and listened, too. 

349
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,600
When the cassette ended, I put another cassette 
in the player. But the soldier stood up.

350
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,560
'It's getting late,' he said. 'I must go.'

351
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:46,800
He went out into the dark night. It was 
about ten o'clock, I think. His usual time.  

352
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,360
A few minutes later, we heard the noise 
when he started the engine of his boat.  

353
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,600
Then the sound of the engine 
went slowly along the coast.  

354
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,480
Soon everything was quiet again. We 
could hear only the sea and the music.

355
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,440
The girl on the cassette was singing another 
love song. It was a sad song, slow but strong.  

356
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,360
The fishermen and I sat quietly and listened.

357
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:26,560
Suddenly Rafael stood up in the corner of 
the cafe and began, very slowly, to dance.  

358
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,840
Alone in the shadows, his eyes 
closed, he moved to the music.

359
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:41,840
He danced, his head back, eyes closed, 
a strange half-smile on his face.  

360
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:52,320
We all watched him in surprise. After a few 
minutes we laughed and went on talking. But Rafael  

361
00:40:52,320 --> 00:41:00,320
went on dancing, dancing alone for the rest of the 
evening. Every time the music stopped he looked  

362
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:07,520
at me with big, dark eyes and said, 'Again.' 
And I put another cassette in the machine.  

363
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,360
Then Rafael smiled, closed his 
eyes, and continued dancing.

364
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:22,080
At midnight all the other men went off to 
bed. Rafael was still there, still dancing.  

365
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,480
I watched the poor boy until the song ended.  

366
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:33,840
Then I switched off the machine. I said good 
night to him, and sent him home to bed.
 
 

367
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,480
Then the next morning, before daylight, we 
heard shouting and crying from Rodrigo's house.  

368
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,240
The news went round the village 
like fire. Anita wasn't there.

369
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,840
Rodrigo sent all his family and friends out 
to look for her. They looked along every road,  

370
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:59,680
big and small. They looked in the fields and 
along the beach, in the rocks. Everywhere.

371
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,880
Later, Rafael came out of 
his house with his mother.  

372
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,240
I told them about Anita, and they were 
very surprised. We all were. Rafael went  

373
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,960
to his boat immediately. He planned to 
sail along the coast and look for her.

374
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:25,200
He sailed away to the west. I watched him until 
I couldn't see him. He sailed round the rocks at  

375
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:33,840
the end of the village. He was looking at the land 
as he went. The next time I saw him, he was mad.

376
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,200
Everybody in the village was out looking for 
Anita that morning. But nobody found her.  

377
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,680
Then Santiago couldn't find his old donkey.  

378
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:54,640
He came to Rodrigo's shop. He was shouting 
that Anita took it. Rodrigo was very angry.  

379
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,640
He wanted to hit Santiago and knock him down. 
I thought he wanted to kill the old man.  

380
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,480
Some friends of Santiago took him away quickly. 
After that, he said nothing more about the donkey.

381
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,280
Then, early in the afternoon, some 
of the fishermen found Rafael.  

382
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,320
He was about a kilometre west of the village, 
in a quiet place near the high rocks.  

383
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,720
His boat wasn't far from the shore and 
Rafael was lying in the bottom of it.  

384
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:37,680
He was wet and dirty. He was looking up at the 
sky and laughing. And he was completely mad.

385
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,080
They brought him and the boat back to the village.  

386
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,200
His mother and I washed him and gave 
him some water. We put him to bed.  

387
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,560
But he lay and made noises all night. He 
screamed and fought. He was like a mad animal.

388
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:02,400
The next day he went out of the house and sat 
by his boat. He looked at the sea all day and  

389
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:10,960
said nothing. We waited, day after day. We gave 
him food and drink. We washed him when we could.  

390
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:19,040
But he was like a small child. We waited 
for him to get better. But he never did.

391
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,680
***

392
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,560
'And you never found out what 
made him mad?' I asked my uncle.

393
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:34,640
'He never speaks. Only about the ring. 
You know everything that I know now,'  

394
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,400
he said. 'When we were washing the poor boy,  

395
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:45,520
we found the gold ring on a fishing line round his 
neck. When we tried to take it off, he screamed.  

396
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:53,520
So we left it there. All these years 
later, he still wears it round his neck.  

397
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:03,840
He gave six months of his life to buy that ring. 
His present for Anita which she never had.'
 
 
 

398
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,440
CHAPTER SEVEN

399
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,840
Two Visits

400
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,840
The next morning, I went with my 
uncle to see Rodrigo, the shopkeeper.  

401
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,280
He had a fine supermarket now, built of stone. 
He still lived in a house behind the shop.  

402
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,560
But now the house was two floors high 
and had a garden with a wall round it.  

403
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,160
He also had his own lorry with his name on it,  

404
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,560
and there was a new car next to the shop. It 
was clear that Rodrigo had plenty of money now.

405
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,640
Inside the supermarket there were 
all kinds of tins and packets.  

406
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,040
There were boxes of fresh fruit 
and vegetables outside the door.  

407
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,840
It was the biggest shop in the village 
and it seemed to sell everything.

408
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:04,320
Rodrigo was a big, heavy man. He was about 
fifty years old and he wore a fine white  

409
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:10,480
suit and a white hat. When we arrived, he 
was unloading boxes of tins from the lorry.  

410
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,480
He was picking them up, three at a 
time, and taking them into the shop.  

411
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,600
He was big and fat. But he 
was still a very strong man.

412
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:28,160
He was polite and friendly to my uncle and me. He 
knew I was a doctor. He invited us into his house.  

413
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:34,080
We sat and had coffee and talked about the changes 
in the village since my first visit as a boy.

414
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:42,480
At last I told him my ideas for helping 
Rafael. Then he wasn't so friendly.

415
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:52,560
'A doctor!' he said. 'He needs more than a 
doctor. I don't know why he's crazy. Nobody does.  

416
00:46:53,520 --> 00:47:00,000
God knows, I've helped him and his mother over the 
years. I've given them food when they were hungry.  

417
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,520
And money when they needed it. His poor mother was 
a good and hard-working woman. Now she's dead. It  

418
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:13,440
was a terrible thing to happen to her. Terrible. 
First her young husband was killed by a shark.  

419
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,000
Then her only son went crazy and 
lived on the beach like an animal.

420
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,320
'Some people say that love made him 
mad. But you're an intelligent man,  

421
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:32,000
doctor. You've studied at university. Does a 
young man of eighteen years go mad for love of  

422
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:40,480
a girl? A strong young man in good health? It's a 
stupid idea. I believe he wasn't in good health.  

423
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:48,320
I think he was ill. I don't know the problem 
exactly. You're the doctor. Help him. Make him  

424
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:54,480
better, if you can. But look for the facts. 
Don't listen to people's silly stories.'

425
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:01,200
'So you don't think that your daughter Anita 
was the reason for his madness?' I asked.

426
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,360
Rodrigo didn't look at us. He 
looked at the wall for a long time.

427
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:17,680
'I don't have a daughter called Anita,' he said at 
last. 'I had one many years ago, but she's dead.'

428
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:25,920
After that, he said nothing more about Rafael 
or Anita. Soon we thanked him and left.

429
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,080
***

430
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,520
Later that morning, a man 
came to my uncle's house.  

431
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,520
He was small and thin. He stood at the 
back door with his hat in his hands.

432
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,200
When my uncle saw him, he brought him inside. 
He found a chair for him and gave him a drink.

433
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,400
'This is Luis Valdez,' he said to me.  

434
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,600
'He's a farmer. He has a farm just 
outside the village to the east.'

435
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:04,400
We sat and talked about farms and the weather. 
Then the man began to ask me about Rafael.

436
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,240
'Is it true, the story that I hear?'  

437
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,920
he asked. 'Are you trying to save 
Rafael, the poor, crazy boy?'

438
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,960
'I'm a doctor,' I answered. 'And 
yes, I'm interested in Rafael.  

439
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:30,080
I'm trying to find out why he went mad. 
Perhaps I can make him better. Perhaps not.'

440
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:39,200
'My wife asked me to talk to you,' he said. 
'She's Marta, Rodrigo's second daughter and  

441
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:46,480
Anita's younger sister. She says she wants 
to talk to you about Anita and Rafael.  

442
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:55,680
But it must be a secret. She knows things that 
even her father Rodrigo doesn't know. She wants  

443
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:02,080
to help Rafael. But she doesn't want to make her 
father angry or unhappy after all these years.'

444
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,160
'Her secrets will be safe with me,' I said.  

445
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,760
'I don't want to make the 
people in the village unhappy.  

446
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:17,440
I only want to help Rafael. If she knows anything 
about Rafael, I'll be happy to talk to her.'

447
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:26,320
That evening I went alone to Luis's 
house. Luis sent his children to bed,  

448
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,320
and Marta began to tell me her story.
 
 
 

449
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,760
CHAPTER EIGHT

450
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,760
The Young Princess

451
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,240
Told by Marta
 
 

452
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:51,040
I'm Rodrigo's second daughter (Marta told 
me). I was seven years younger than Anita.  

453
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:59,920
When I was a little girl, it was very 
strange. Anita was beautiful; I wasn't.  

454
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:08,400
Anita was clever; I wasn't. She could read 
and tell stories, sing and draw pictures.  

455
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:18,000
I couldn't. I was small, fat and stupid. 
But I've been lucky I married a good  

456
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,120
husband. I have two healthy sons and a pretty 
daughter. Now I'm very happy with my life.

457
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:33,600
But I must tell you about my sister Anita. 
It's true that she was beautiful and clever.  

458
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:41,440
But, I'm sorry to say, she wasn't 
a very good child. Not very nice.  

459
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:49,280
Our parents gave her everything she wanted. She 
could do anything she liked. She never worked  

460
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,520
or helped our mother in the house. I remember 
that her hands were always clean and beautiful.  

461
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,960
Her fingernails were long and pink. They 
were never broken or bitten like mine.

462
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,120
Everyone thought she was beautiful and clever.  

463
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,760
Everyone smiled at her. 
Everyone did what she wanted.

464
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:18,240
She became proud and lazy. I remember she 
told us stories, sitting near the house.  

465
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:26,080
But her voice was very loud and clear, and all the 
people near us could hear her clever words. She  

466
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:32,240
often sang to herself in the house. But she sang 
only when there were people outside to hear her.

467
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:39,920
I'm sorry. This isn't important, really. 
But she did other things. Worse things.

468
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:48,320
We slept in a small room at the back of the old 
house. I was only eight or nine years old then.  

469
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,680
Anita had most of the room for her 
things, and I slept in the corner.

470
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:02,720
One night, I remember, it was very late. Our 
parents were in their room asleep, and something  

471
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:10,000
woke me up. I saw Anita going quietly out of 
the room. She was wearing a dress and shoes.  

472
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,520
The moon was very bright that night, 
and I couldn't sleep again. I lay awake,  

473
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:24,800
waiting. About half an hour later, Anita came 
quietly back into the room and got into her bed.

474
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,400
'Where have you been?' I asked her.

475
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,680
She was very angry, because I was awake.

476
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:39,360
'Go to sleep, stupid girl,' she said. 'I had 
stomach-ache. I only went out for a few minutes.  

477
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,160
Don't say anything to anyone.'

478
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,360
I said nothing, but after that I watched her.  

479
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:54,560
I saw her go out on other nights. 
At last, I asked her where she went.

480
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:03,280
She laughed quietly. 'I go to meet my 
prince,' she said. That was all that she said.  

481
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,520
Her head was full of the stories 
that she read in her books.  

482
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:14,720
She loved stories about princes and princesses. 
Stories about magic carpets which could fly,  

483
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:22,160
and magic lamps and rings. These were the stories 
that she told us most often. She didn't have  

484
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:28,400
to read them. She knew them all. She imagined 
that she was a beautiful princess in a story.  

485
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,160
She never believed that she was only a 
shopkeeper's child. Perhaps a king gave  

486
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:40,480
her to her parents in secret when she was a baby. 
She had many strange and silly ideas in her head.

487
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
***

488
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,160
'But who did she go to see? Who 
was this prince?' I asked Marta.

489
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,960
'It was Rafael, of course,' she 
replied. 'They were in love.  

490
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:57,120
Even when they were little children. She went out 
at night to the big rocks at the end of the beach.  

491
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:03,200
Rafael came and met her there. They sat 
there in the rocks in the moonlight.  

492
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,960
They talked about their love and the 
happy married life that they planned.

493
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:14,720
'Our parents had no idea that she was doing this, 
of course. Anita told me to keep quiet about it.  

494
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:23,040
"If you tell anyone," she said "I'll say terrible 
things about you to our parents. They'll believe  

495
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:30,560
me. They won't believe you." And it was true. 
I knew it was true. They always believed Anita.

496
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:37,440
'She could always do what she wanted. I 
was always in trouble. So I said nothing.

497
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:46,400
'Then Rafael went away to work in the port. For 
six months, Anita lost her prince. In the daytime,  

498
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:52,640
she was the same as before. But at night she 
cried in her bed, because her Rafael was far away.

499
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,120
'But when he came back, she was happy again. 
She went to meet him at the big rocks.

500
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,840
'After a few days she came back from one of 
these meetings with a ring on her finger.  

501
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:12,640
She showed it to me in the moonlight in our room. 
It was the gold ring in the shape of a fish.  

502
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,640
She was very proud of it. She wore it on 
her finger when she went to meet Rafael.  

503
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,880
At other times she kept it 
under the carpet in our room.'

504
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,200
Marta stopped and drank from a glass of water.  

505
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:33,760
I didn't know what to say. This wasn't the 
same Anita that my uncle described to me.

506
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,080
'Do you know what happened to Anita?' I asked.  

507
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,320
'Do you know where she went that 
night? The night she went away?'

508
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,760
Marta thought for a few long seconds.

509
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:55,360
'I can remember what I saw. And I can remember 
what I heard, she said. 'I remember all that  

510
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:11,920
exactly. I shall never forget it. But 
I'm still not sure what happened.'
 
 
 

511
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,720
CHAPTER NINE

512
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,960
The True Prince

513
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,960
Told by Marta
 
 

514
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:26,080
On that Sunday night (Marta continued), 
I went to bed early. About eight o'clock,  

515
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:33,760
I think, like most younger children. My father was 
in the living room. He was talking to the soldier.  

516
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,320
The soldier stayed for a meal that evening. 
I could hear their voices through the walls.  

517
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:46,000
They had the new paraffin lamp in there with them, 
I remember. It made a bright light in that room.

518
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,800
Anita was in our room, too. Father 
sent her to bed because the soldier  

519
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:59,120
was there. She was lying on her bed and 
reading by the light of a small oil lamp.  

520
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,880
She was listening to the 
talk in the living room, too.  

521
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:09,680
I remember that we could hear the soldier's 
deep voice very clearly through the thin walls.

522
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:17,760
I think I fell asleep. When I woke 
up, it was later, but not very late.  

523
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,800
The bright light from the lamp was still 
shining under the door of the living room.  

524
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:29,440
My parents were in there, talking quietly. 
But the soldier wasn't there with them.

525
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:37,680
Anita was taking things out of her box and 
putting them in a bag. I sat up and spoke to her.

526
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:44,880
She told me to be quiet. She continued 
taking her best dresses out of the box  

527
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,840
and putting them in the bag. I 
asked her what she was doing.  

528
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,240
'I'm going to meet my true love, my true 
prince,' she said. 'I'm going away with him.'  

529
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:04,720
She laughed and sang quietly, 'The girl with 
the magic ring will always know her true love.'

530
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:12,400
She told me to say nothing. Then she 
went very quietly to the back door  

531
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:19,760
and went out into the dark night. Her hand 
quietly pulled the door closed behind her.  

532
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,520
On her middle finger she wore 
the gold ring shaped like a fish.

533
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:34,640
I went to the window and looked out. I was 
terribly afraid, I knew Anita was a silly child,  

534
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:40,560
but this was very, very wrong. 'If Father 
finds out, he'll kill her,' I thought.  

535
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:47,840
'He gets angry very quickly, and he's very 
strong.' But I was afraid of Anita, too.  

536
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:54,560
So I stood there looking out 
of the window. I cried quietly.

537
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:03,600
There was no moon and it was very dark. I heard 
music playing in the cafe along the beach. It was  

538
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:11,120
a nice song, a slow song. I listened to the music 
and the soft sound of the waves on the beach.  

539
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,840
Soon I felt a little better.  

540
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:22,320
After a long time, I started to feel cold. 
So I went back to my bed and fell asleep.

541
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:31,600
I woke up again much later. The house was 
dark and quiet. My parents were asleep.  

542
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:38,160
Nobody was talking anywhere in the 
house. Anita's bed was still empty.  

543
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:45,520
I went to the window again. The moon was up 
and I could see the houses along the beach.  

544
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,440
There was still a light in 
the cafe and music playing.

545
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:58,320
I went back to bed. I cried until I fell 
asleep. I hoped that it was all a bad dream.

546
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,440
When I woke again, the first grey 
light of the new day was in the room.  

547
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:13,280
Anita's bed was still empty. I lay in bed with 
my eyes closed until my mother came to wake us.  

548
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:23,120
When she found Anita's empty bed, she started 
to shout and scream. Then I opened my eyes. I  

549
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:29,440
soon started to cry, too. I never told 
them where she went. Or what she said.  

550
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:37,840
There was terrible shouting and crying in our 
house that day. But we never saw Anita again.

551
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
***

552
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,880
'So you think she went to see 
Rafael that night?' I said slowly.

553
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,840
'Oh, no,' said Marta. 'I think she 
went to meet the soldier, Carlos.  

554
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:58,000
That's why she called him her true prince. 
He was like someone in a story, you see.  

555
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:05,440
First the beautiful princess falls in love with 
a poor fisherman. Then either he turns into a  

556
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:11,120
handsome prince, or a real prince comes 
along and takes her away to his palace.  

557
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:17,520
I'm afraid Anita was quite a silly girl, 
really. She lived the stories in her head.  

558
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,640
After the soldier came to the village, she 
started to meet him at night. She went to the  

559
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:32,160
same place in the rocks. But she was meeting the 
soldier, not Rafael. She went there many times.  

560
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:39,680
Then, that night, she didn't come back. 
She went away with him in his boat.  

561
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:47,920
In those days, perhaps, a boat with 
an engine was like a magic carpet.'

562
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,920
'But she was wearing the gold 
ring when she went? I said.

563
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:59,040
'Yes, she took all her best things: 
dresses, her story books, and the ring.'

564
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,840
'But Rafael has that ring. He has worn it 
round his neck for more than thirteen years.'

565
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:13,840
'I know,' she said. 'I think she spoke to 
Rafael that night. I think she told him her  

566
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:20,240
plans. Then she gave him his ring and went off 
to meet the soldier somewhere along the coast.'

567
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,200
'Is that what you really think?' I asked.

568
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:33,760
'Yes,' said Marta. 'She said goodbye to 
Rafael and gave him his ring. Then she went  

569
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:40,560
to meet the soldier. That's what made Rafael 
mad. He went to look for her the next day,  

570
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:46,960
but all the time he had the ring round his neck. 
He wanted her to come back. Or he wanted her  

571
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:53,200
father to find her and bring her back. But 
she never came. And when she didn't come,  

572
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,360
Rafael went mad. When you talk 
to Rafael, what does he say?'

573
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,160
'He holds the ring, and says,  

574
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:09,360
"She gave me the ring," or "She gave 
me the golden fish",' I answered

575
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:17,520
'Exactly,' said Marta. 'First she 
took his ring and said, "I love you."  

576
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:25,840
Then she gave it back to him and went away with 
the soldier. That's what made the poor man crazy.'

577
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,320
'What was so special about the ring?' I asked.  

578
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,360
'What did Anita say? 
Something about a magic ring?'

579
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:45,200
'The girl with the magic ring will always know 
her true love. It was in her story,' said Marta.  

580
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:51,440
'Her own story. She wrote it herself. It 
wasn't a story that she read in a book.  

581
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,400
It was her favourite story. She 
told it to us hundreds of times.'

582
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,000
'And it was about a magic ring?'

583
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:08,000
'Yes. In fact, I have the story here. 
Anita wrote it in a notebook and I kept it.  

584
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,320
It's the only thing of Anita's that I have. I 
can't read it, of course, but it's that story.'

585
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:20,560
Marta went into another room 
and came back with a small,  

586
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:28,000
thin notebook. She carried it carefully in both 
hands. She put it on the table in front of me.

587
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:34,320
It was a cheap school writing book. 
The pages were yellow with age.  

588
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:41,520
There was only one story in it. It was 
called 'The Ring of the Golden Fish'.  

589
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:49,840
The story was short. It was written in pencil 
in the large, clear writing of a young child.

590
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,040
Luis and Marta looked at me.  

591
01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:03,840
I realized they were waiting. They wanted 
to hear me read the story to them.
 
 
 

592
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:05,680
CHAPTER TEN

593
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,880
'The Ring of the Golden Fish'

594
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,880
This is the story that I read 
to Marta and her husband.  

595
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,120
The story that was written by 
Anita all those years ago.
 
 

596
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:30,320
A long time ago, there was a beautiful princess. 
She lived in a beautiful palace with big,  

597
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:37,520
beautiful gardens all round it. But she was sad 
because she had no friends. She couldn't talk to  

598
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:45,840
anyone or play with anyone. She was a prisoner 
in the palace because she was so beautiful.

599
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,520
Her father wanted her to 
marry a rich, handsome prince.  

600
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:56,240
But the princes in that country weren't 
handsome. And the rich men weren't princes.  

601
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:05,280
And the handsome men weren't princes or rich. 
So she married nobody, and she was very sad.

602
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:13,000
One day, a poor fisherman came to the 
beach at the end of the palace gardens.  

603
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:20,720
The gardens were very big and went as far as 
the sea. The fisherman caught a big golden  

604
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:27,840
fish and he wanted to kill it. But it 
was a magic fish and it spoke to him.

605
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,800
'Don't kill me,' it said, 
'and I'll give you a magic  

606
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:37,360
ring. And with this ring 
you can marry the princess.'

607
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,200
So the handsome young fisherman 
put the fish back into the sea.  

608
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,520
Soon it came back with a gold ring in its mouth.

609
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:56,080
'The man with this magic ring will always 
know his true love,' said the fish.  

610
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,600
And it swam away to the bottom of the sea.

611
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,120
The handsome young fisherman was called Roberto.  

612
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,840
(Here the name Rafael was 
written first and then changed.)  

613
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:18,800
When Roberto put on the ring, he saw in his head a 
picture of the princess. He fell in love with her.

614
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,840
He walked through the gardens to the 
palace, looking for the princess.  

615
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,720
When he found her in the garden, he put 
the magic ring on her finger. And she knew  

616
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:37,360
immediately that she loved the handsome young 
fisherman. They went to her father, the king,  

617
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:44,400
and he gave the poor fisherman half his lands. 
And they were married and lived happily forever.
 
 

618
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:54,800
It wasn't really a very good story. It borrowed a 
lot from other stories. But it told me a lot about  

619
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:01,600
poor Anita. It told me why Rafael suddenly 
decided to work in the port for six months.  

620
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,800
It told me why he brought her a 
gold ring in the shape of a fish.

621
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:15,920
I went back to my uncle's house. It was late 
at night, but I sat with him and drank coffee.  

622
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:24,320
My head was full of changing ideas. I 
said very little, but I thought a lot.

623
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:30,480
'Have you learned anything important 
or useful?' asked my uncle.

624
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:39,440
'I don't know,' I said. 'I can't tell you what 
Marta told me. I promised to keep it a secret.  

625
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:47,840
But are you sure about what you told 
me? You haven't made any mistakes?'

626
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,720
My uncle thought for a few seconds.  

627
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:58,160
'Yes, I'm sure. I haven't forgotten 
anything important,' he said.

628
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:06,320
'Did Rafael really come to the cafe when the 
soldier was still there? Are you sure about that?'

629
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:16,160
'Oh yes. I'm sure. I remember how they looked. 
Rafael was clean and fine in his best clothes.  

630
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,360
The soldier was sitting at the 
table with his friends round him.  

631
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:26,320
But he was looking at Rafael all the time. 
They were like two dogs, looking for a fight.'

632
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:32,560
'And Rafael stayed in the cafe 
and danced until late at night.  

633
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,680
And you were with him all that time.'

634
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,560
'I was with the poor boy all 
the time until nearly midnight.  

635
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,840
Then I closed the cafe and sent him home.'

636
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:49,120
'Then how did Anita give him the ring?'  

637
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:56,560
I asked myself. 'She didn't leave the house 
until the music was playing in the cafe.  

638
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:05,840
And at that time she had the ring on her hand. And 
Rafael was already in the cafe with the soldier.  

639
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:14,480
And he stayed there until midnight, about two 
hours after the soldier left in his boat.'
 
 
 

640
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,600
CHAPTER ELEVEN

641
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,840
Rosa's Promise

642
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:29,520
That night I slept badly. Poor Rafael with 
his mad eyes came into my dreams many times.  

643
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:36,320
He was holding the gold ring. He was 
showing it to me and asking me to help him.

644
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:44,080
The next morning I sat outside my uncle's 
house. I looked out at the calm blue sea.  

645
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,520
I was very tired and unhappy.  

646
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:55,280
Soon my uncle came out and sat with me. His 
wife Rosa brought out coffee and eggs for us.

647
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,560
'What will you do now?' asked my uncle.

648
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:08,560
'I don't know. I still don't know why 
Rafael went mad. I still don't know  

649
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:16,560
when exactly. I can't believe that a man 
can go crazy for love of a girl. You say  

650
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:23,920
Anita was very beautiful. But a strong young 
man doesn't go mad for love. Rodrigo is right.  

651
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:33,120
I can't explain it. But I'm sure it was something 
more strange, more terrible. There is a reason,  

652
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:37,840
but I haven't found it. I think 
nobody here in the village knows it.'

653
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,040
'So, what will you do?' asked my uncle again.

654
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,680
'I'll take Rafael to the hospital in the capital.  

655
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:56,800
If you help me, I'll give him some medicine. 
Then he'll go to sleep. When he's in hospital,  

656
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:04,000
I can begin to help him. I believe 
something terrible happened to him.  

657
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,760
I don't mean when Anita ran away with the 
soldier. I mean something really terrible,  

658
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:18,640
something strange and frightening. Rafael is 
afraid to remember it. That's why he's mad. At  

659
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:24,880
the hospital I can give him modern medicines. 
They'll help him to sleep and to feel happy.  

660
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:32,400
Then perhaps he'll remember what happened to 
him. If he can remember, he'll get better.'

661
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:41,760
Rosa was standing in the door. She came to 
me and took my hand. She looked into my face.  

662
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:49,760
Her eyes were full of tears and she looked 
terribly afraid. 'Please don't take Rafael  

663
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:55,840
to hospital,' she said. 'Leave him here in the 
village with us. He'll be all right with us.'

664
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:03,280
I was surprised. There were tears in her 
eyes. She really was very worried and afraid.  

665
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:08,960
I thought it was the hospital. Village 
people are often afraid of hospitals.  

666
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,920
They believe that people 
only go to hospitals to die.

667
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:21,280
'Please don't worry, Aunt Rosa,' I said 
calmly. 'I won't hurt him. I really think  

668
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:26,160
I can help him to remember. With God's 
help, perhaps I can make him better.'

669
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:35,360
'He mustn't remember,' she cried. 'He's 
mad because of his crime. He went mad  

670
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:41,840
because of the terrible thing that he did. He 
mustn't remember. If he remembers, he'll die.'

671
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,480
My uncle and I looked at 
Rosa. We were very surprised.  

672
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,560
Her face was red and tears 
were running down her face.

673
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,800
'What do you know about Rafael's madness?'  

674
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:01,200
asked my uncle quietly. 'I'm sure 
you know something. Tell us now.'

675
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,680
Rosa put her wet face in her hands.

676
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:13,680
'I promised poor Clara not to tell,' she 
cried. 'I promised her on her death bed.  

677
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:20,560
But if you leave her poor son 
here with us, I'll tell you.'

678
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:27,280
Rosa dried her eyes. She sat on 
the steps in front of the house.  

679
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:34,240
She didn't look at us. She looked out at 
the sea all the time as she told her story.

680
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:42,400
'I sat with his mother, my sister, 
when she was very ill five years ago.  

681
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:49,280
Before she died, I promised to be 
a mother to her poor, mad son.'

682
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:55,520
'We know that,' said my uncle. 'You and 
I agreed to look after him. And we have.  

683
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,360
But what did she tell you 
about why Rafael went mad?'

684
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,280
Rosa put her face in her hands.

685
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:11,040
'Please don't tell anyone,' she cried. 
'I promised to keep her secret forever.'

686
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:16,320
'We promise,' I said. 'What secret?'

687
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:25,360
'The secret of Rafael's madness,' 
said Rosa. 'His mother knew it.  

688
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,800
But she kept his secret from everyone.  

689
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:43,440
He was mad because he did a terrible thing. He 
did it for love, from hate, the poor, poor boy.'

690
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:45,520
'What did he do?'

691
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:53,840
'He killed a man. He took another 
man's life. The worst crime of all.  

692
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:01,840
He murdered the soldier, 
because of his love for Anita.'

693
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:07,840
'He did what? But that's 
impossible!' shouted my uncle.

694
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:17,440
'That's what Clara told me,' said Rosa. 'She 
told me everything only hours before she died.  

695
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,160
She couldn't meet God with 
that secret in her heart.'

696
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:31,040
'But how? When?' I asked 
her quietly. 'Did she say?'

697
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,160
'I'll tell you what Clara told me,'  

698
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:45,440
said Rosa. 'Her words are written in fire 
on my heart. I'll never forget them.'
 
 
 

699
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,680
CHAPTER TWELVE

700
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,560
A Terrible Secret

701
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:57,840
Told to Rosa by Clara
 
 

702
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,440
It happened that Sunday evening (said Clara).

703
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:13,520
It was the evening before Anita went away. I 
cooked some fish and rice for myself and Rafael.  

704
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,600
Soon it was ready, but Rafael was out in his boat.  

705
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:28,080
He often went out soon after it was dark. 
That day he was out for more than an hour.

706
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,440
Then I heard his boat come on 
to the beach near our house.  

707
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,840
As you know, the house stands 
alone at the end of the village.  

708
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:46,480
But still Rafael didn't come to the house, 
and the food was getting cold and dry.

709
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:55,120
So I took the small oil lamp from my kitchen 
and I went down to the sea to find him.

710
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:02,400
The boat was half on the sand and half 
in the water. Rafael was standing next  

711
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:09,600
to it. He was washing the inside of the boat. 
There was a lot of water in the bottom of it.  

712
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:17,760
I came near with the small lamp. The 
light shone on Rafael and the boat.  

713
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:26,080
He was very wet - his head and hair, his 
clothes. The water was running down him.

714
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:33,440
Then I saw something terrible. 
There was blood on Rafael's clothes.  

715
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:41,280
Blood in his hair. Blood running down his face. 
His wet shirt and trousers were covered in it.  

716
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:47,040
There was fresh blood on his hands, 
red in the light of the lamp.

717
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,880
'God save us!' I said. 'What's happened?'

718
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,840
'I'm all right, mother,' he 
answered. 'Don't be afraid.  

719
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,960
But I've killed the stranger who 
came here to steal my true love.'

720
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:08,720
Then I saw that all the water m the 
bottom of the boat was dark with blood.

721
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:15,280
I put out the lamp immediately. There 
was no moon and the night was dark.  

722
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,480
I looked round at the empty beach.

723
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:28,240
'Take off those clothes,' I said quietly. 
'Wash yourself in the sea until you're clean.  

724
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:36,880
Then go to the house and put on clean clothes. 
Go quickly to the cafe, so people can see you.  

725
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:45,360
I'll wash your clothes and the boat. Nobody will 
know what you've done. If the soldier stops coming  

726
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:51,360
here, people won't be very surprised. The man was 
a stranger. He had no family or close friends.'

727
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:59,840
Rafael did what 1 told him. He went to the 
cafe and stayed there all that evening.  

728
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,920
While he was there, I washed the boat.  

729
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:13,840
Then I washed his shirt and trousers many 
times, until you couldn't see the blood.

730
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,360
***

731
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:24,400
'Oh, Rosa, my dear wife,' said 
my uncle quietly. 'Have you kept  

732
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,920
this dark secret in your heart 
all these years since Clara died?'

733
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:36,400
'I promised her. She asked me 
before she died,' cried Rosa.

734
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:45,280
'She was as mad as her son!' said my uncle 
angrily. 'We know the soldier ate with  

735
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:52,560
Rodrigo in his house that evening. Then he came 
straight to the cafe. I saw him and talked to him.  

736
01:21:53,680 --> 01:22:00,800
He left the cafe, alive and well, about an hour 
later I heard him leave the village in his boat.  

737
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:06,160
More important, Rafael was with me 
in the cafe when the soldier left.  

738
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,480
Yes, he was wearing his best 
clothes and he was very clean.  

739
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:17,760
But when Rafael came into the cafe, the soldier 
was sitting there, alive. I promise you.'

740
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:23,840
'Perhaps he followed the soldier in 
his boat when he left that night.  

741
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:31,760
Perhaps he killed him on the sea later,' said 
Rosa. 'Clara didn't remember the time exactly.'

742
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:39,280
'Impossible,' said my uncle. 'Rafael stayed 
in the cafe with me and a lot of other men.  

743
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:46,240
He was dancing to the music. He didn't 
leave the cafe for about two hours. And  

744
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:51,840
Rafael couldn't catch the Soldier's boat. 
It had an engine. It was a very fast boat.'

745
01:22:53,360 --> 01:23:01,680
'He killed someone,' said Rosa. And he thought 
it was the soldier. I don't know who he killed.  

746
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:08,720
But that's what his good mother told me. I must 
believe her. Perhaps Rafael thought he killed  

747
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:16,960
the soldier. Then later he saw him in the cafe 
and went mad. It was still a terrible crime.  

748
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:25,280
Perhaps that's why he went crazy. But 
who did he kill? No, it's impossible.'

749
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:33,840
Rosa ran into the house, crying. My 
uncle and I looked at the empty blue sea.  

750
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:42,400
We didn't speak for a long time. There was food 
on the table, but we didn't feel very hungry.

751
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:48,000
'Is it possible?' I asked at last.

752
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:55,600
'What? That Rafael killed somebody 
by mistake. No. It's not possible.'

753
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,200
'But his mother's story...'

754
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:11,680
'Listen!' said my uncle. 'I'm not stupid. When 
Rafael came into the cafe, he saw the soldier.  

755
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:16,240
He didn't look surprised. 
He didn't even look angry.  

756
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:23,680
They both listened to the music for about an hour. 
Rafael was happy. He was smiling and dancing.'

757
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:28,320
'All right,' I said. 'I believe you.  

758
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:35,280
I believe everybody. But this mystery 
is going to make me crazy soon.'
 
 
 

759
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,800
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

760
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,840
In the Hospital

761
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:52,080
All that morning my head went round 
and round. It was all impossible.  

762
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:59,920
I took a notebook and wrote some questions 
in it. I still have that notebook with me.  

763
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:05,760
Sometimes, when I start feeling 
very proud of myself, I read it.
 
 

764
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:18,000
Question 1: Did Rafael kill someone? Is that 
why he went mad? His mother thought he did.  

765
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:23,600
She saw him covered in blood. But who did he kill?

766
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:31,840
Not the soldier. He left the cafe when 
Rafael was still in it with my uncle.

767
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:39,840
Not Anita. She was with her sister 
until the music started in the cafe.

768
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,040
And Rafael was inside the cafe then.

769
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:45,680
So who?

770
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,400
Impossible!

771
01:25:50,880 --> 01:26:01,520
Question 2: Was the soldier killed, or did he 
only go away? If he was killed, who killed him?

772
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:07,840
Not Rafael. He was in the cafe until midnight.

773
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:12,000
Not Anita. She was a child, and loved him.

774
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,120
Who could kill him? He was a strong  

775
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,320
young man, a soldier. And he was 
friendly with everyone in the village.

776
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:24,640
Impossible!

777
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:31,760
Question 3: Did Anita run away with the soldier,  

778
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:39,200
or was she killed, too? If she 
was killed, who killed her?

779
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:46,400
Not Rafael. He loved her. And 
he was in the cafe all evening.  

780
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:56,480
Perhaps the soldier, and he then ran away. 
But why? He loved her and wanted to marry her.

781
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:03,840
And if the soldier killed 
her; why did Rafael go mad?

782
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:05,680
Impossible!
 
 

783
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:14,640
I read all my notes and questions again 
and again. Everything seemed impossible.

784
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,440
Suddenly I looked at them again.  

785
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,840
There was someone in the village who 
was big enough and strong enough.  

786
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:36,000
Someone who could kill the soldier. He had a good 
reason to kill him. There was someone who had a  

787
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:43,600
good reason to kill Anita, too. Perhaps he saw 
her leaving the house with her bag that night.  

788
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:53,920
Perhaps he followed her along the dark and empty 
beach, quietly through the soft sand. Perhaps he  

789
01:27:53,920 --> 01:28:02,240
saw her meet the soldier. Perhaps he killed both 
of them and put their dead bodies deep in the sea.

790
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:11,760
There was another man who loved Anita. And 
that man could kill her for running away.  

791
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:16,480
He was big enough and strong 
enough to kill the soldier.  

792
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:27,840
That man was Rodrigo, her father. 
But then the wrong man was mad.

793
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,440
***

794
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,960
I am a doctor, not a policeman or a detective.  

795
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:39,280
I believed I was a clever man, more 
intelligent than the people of the village.  

796
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:47,760
I was too proud of myself. I told my uncle and 
all the people of the village about my plans  

797
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:55,840
to help poor Rafael. I, the great doctor from the 
university in the city, could make him well again.

798
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:05,760
I was too proud. I spent a week in the village 
and I talked to a lot of people. But I still  

799
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:13,760
knew nothing about Rafael's madness. I still had 
no idea what happened to the soldier or Anita.  

800
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:23,840
I couldn't be sure that Rodrigo killed them. It 
was a stupid idea. I didn't really believe it.

801
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:28,480
I promised Rosa and Marta to 
tell nobody what they told me.  

802
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:39,600
It was our secret. I went back to my hospital 
to do my work. I wasn't so proud. I decided not  

803
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:45,440
to think about what happened in the village. 
It wasn't a good idea to try to change things.

804
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:48,480
***

805
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:56,000
I heard nothing from my uncle or anyone in the 
village for almost a year. I often dreamt of  

806
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:03,760
Rafael and his gold ring when I was very tired. 
But I never went back to the village. I didn't  

807
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:10,160
want to meet those good people. I was sure 
they didn't have a good opinion of me now.

808
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,240
Then, one day, a fisherman 
brought a note to the hospital.  

809
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,280
It was written by Rodrigo, 
the shopkeeper. It said:
 
 

810
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:31,600
Rafael is very ill. We think he's dying. 
Please come immediately. Only you can help  

811
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:40,000
us. Please come. Remember my dear daughter 
Anita and poor, mad Rafael and help us.  

812
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:46,080
Your uncle asked me to write this 
letter. But I want you to come, too.  

813
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:54,960
Perhaps at last we can find out what really 
happened to my daughter all those many years ago.

814
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,560
Rodrigo Garcia
 
 

815
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:04,400
I took a small ambulance from the 
hospital and went to the village.  

816
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:14,240
I was there in a few hours. I went straight to my 
uncle's house. Rafael was there, lying on a bed.  

817
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:21,440
Rosa was putting cold wet cloths on his 
head. Rafael was very thin and yellow.  

818
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:28,000
When I came into the room, he coughed 
weakly. Blood ran from his mouth.  

819
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:35,120
Rosa washed away the blood with another 
cloth. It was already red with Rafael's blood.

820
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:44,080
'It's tuberculosis,' I said 
immediately. 'He's very ill.'

821
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:49,120
'Yes, I know,' said my uncle. 
'That's why I asked you to come.  

822
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:54,080
It's very bad. I don't think 
there's any hope for him.'

823
01:31:56,080 --> 01:32:03,440
'I'll take him to the hospital,' I said. 'I've got 
an ambulance with me. With medicines and nursing,  

824
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:11,840
perhaps we can still save him. But there's 
not much hope for him. He's very weak.'

825
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:19,040
We put Rafael in the ambulance and I took him 
back to the hospital in the city. He was almost  

826
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:26,400
dead. We washed him and cut his hair and beard. 
We put him in a clean bed and gave him medicines.

827
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:36,400
I sat by his bed for eight hours. He didn't 
move. He lay like a dead man. His body  

828
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:44,800
temperature was very high. Then, very slowly, it 
began to fall, and he fell into a quiet sleep.

829
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:53,840
Two days later, he opened his eyes. He was 
still having medicines and he was very weak.  

830
01:32:54,800 --> 01:33:02,000
He lay without moving. Only his eyes moved. 
He looked round the strange white walls,  

831
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:07,840
at the plastic bottle above his head. He 
looked at me in my white coat at his side.

832
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,880
'Am I dead?' he asked, very quietly.

833
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:25,360
'No, Rafael,' I said. 'You're in hospital I'm 
a doctor. Miguel, the owner of the cafe in your  

834
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:31,360
village, is my uncle. Don't be afraid. 
We're trying to make you well again.'

835
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:41,600
His mouth moved in a tired smile, and he fell 
asleep again. I brought a nurse to sit by his bed.

836
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:47,440
'Tell me if he wakes up. Or 
if he gets worse,' I said. 

837
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:54,960
Then I went to my room in the hospital and 
fell on the bed. I was asleep in a few seconds.

838
01:33:56,160 --> 01:34:01,520
There was little hope for poor Rafael. He 
was thin and weak after all the years that  

839
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:08,400
he lived on the beach. For years he ate very 
little. He slept on the cold, hard ground.  

840
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:14,000
The tuberculosis was very 
bad. He was very, very ill.

841
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,840
But he wasn't mad.

842
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:24,720
He could speak very little. Most 
of the time he was very tired.  

843
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:29,600
But when he spoke to me, his 
words were clear and calm.  

844
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:39,040
He lived for six days in the hospital. 
He slept, he woke. And when he was awake,  

845
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:46,800
he talked to me. Coughing blood, he told 
me everything. Then, on the sixth day,  

846
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:55,360
he fell quietly asleep. And after a few hours 
his heart stopped and he was dead. After his  

847
01:34:55,360 --> 01:35:01,280
long years of pain and madness, I was happy 
that his death was quiet and easy at the end.  

848
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:10,000
He did a terrible thing, a terrible crime. 
But he paid for it with long years of madness.

849
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:17,440
I have written his story down here. 
One day, perhaps, people will read it.  

850
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:27,840
But not until all the people in it are dead. 
Until that day, it must stay a secret.
 
 
 

851
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,040
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

852
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,200
The Murder

853
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,680
This is what Rafael told me:

854
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:45,440
Rafael always loved Anita. He couldn't 
remember a time when he didn't.  

855
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:50,240
It was a small village and the 
children always played on the beach.  

856
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:57,920
Anita and the other girls watched the fishermen. 
The men cleaned their boats and mended their nets.  

857
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:02,320
Rafael fell in love with Anita 
when they were still children.  

858
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:09,840
He loved her, and she loved 
him. Or she always said so.

859
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:17,280
But her father wanted her to marry a rich 
man. A fat old man, perhaps, old and ugly.  

860
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:25,120
But he must be rich and important. Rafael 
could do nothing to change Rodrigo's plans.

861
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:33,760
There was a place in the rocks at the end of the 
beach to the west. The children often played in  

862
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:42,080
it. It was like a little house in the rocks. In 
the evenings, Rafael sometimes met Anita there.  

863
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:50,400
She came out of her house very quietly and ran 
to their secret place in the rocks. There she  

864
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:57,200
and Rafael talked for a few golden minutes. 
Then she ran home again, afraid of her father.  

865
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:05,840
Anita was only fifteen years old at that time. 
But her head was full of the stories in her books.  

866
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,920
She was sure she was in love with 
the handsome young fisherman.

867
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:17,600
Rafael brought her the gold ring. It 
was like the magic ring in her story.  

868
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:25,600
Her father didn't accept it from Rafael. But 
Rafael gave it to Anita in secret, when they  

869
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:33,200
met later in their secret place in the rocks. The 
ring was the promise of their love. She wore it  

870
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:40,560
when she was with him. At other times she kept it 
in her room, in the secret place under the carpet.

871
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:49,280
But then the soldier came to the village. 
He was an older man. With his bright eyes,  

872
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:55,040
his long hair, his boat with an engine, 
he was much more exciting than Rafael.  

873
01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:02,240
When he talked with Rodrigo about his life and 
his travels, Anita heard his stories through  

874
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:08,880
the wall of her room. These stories were more 
exciting than magic lamps and talking fish.

875
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:17,840
Anita soon thought Rafael was very boring. She 
stopped meeting him. She stopped speaking to him.  

876
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:22,400
Now she was sure she was falling 
in love with the soldier.  

877
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,320
But she still kept Rafael's ring, of course.

878
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:34,640
Rafael was very sad. He wanted the soldier 
to leave the village and go away for ever.  

879
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,680
He wanted Anita to come back to him.

880
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:44,560
But then, one night, Rafael was 
coming back late from a fishing trip.  

881
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,320
He saw Anita running along the beach in the 
moonlight. He watched quietly from the sea.  

882
01:38:53,840 --> 01:39:01,040
He saw Anita meet the soldier in the little house 
in the rocks. How did the soldier speak to her?  

883
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:09,520
How did Anita give him the time and place 
to meet? Rafael didn't know. Perhaps the  

884
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:16,160
soldier gave her a secret note. Perhaps Anita 
gave him one. They could both read and write.

885
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:23,360
Rafael left his boat and swam to 
the shore. He moved very quietly  

886
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:29,520
through the rocks. The soldier's boat 
was in a small piece of open water  

887
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:34,880
on the other side of the rocks. It was only about 
ten minutes from the village along the coast.

888
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:41,680
Rafael watched and waited until he 
saw Anita run back to the village.  

889
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:50,240
Then he watched the soldier swim back to his 
boat. After a few minutes, the soldier started  

890
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:59,040
his engine and went away to the west. Rafael was 
very angry. But he was angry with the soldier,  

891
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:05,120
not Anita. He hated this man who was a 
stranger in the village. A man who the  

892
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:12,560
people all accepted as a friend. But a man who was 
now stealing Anita, his own true love, from them.

893
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:20,960
Next time the soldier came to the village 
Rafael watched him. When the soldier went  

894
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:26,000
away in the evening, Rafael went quietly 
along the beach to the place in the rocks.  

895
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:31,600
Soon the soldier's boat came 
back into the place in the rocks  

896
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:36,960
and he lowered his anchor. The soldier 
swam for a few minutes in the moonlight.  

897
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:41,360
Then he sat in the boat 
again and smoked a cigarette.

898
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:47,440
He sat for a long time, 
looking sometimes at his watch.  

899
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:53,440
At last he swam to the beach and went 
to the secret place in the rocks.  

900
01:40:54,640 --> 01:41:02,320
He waited there. Soon Anita came, hurrying 
over the rocks. She and the soldier kissed.  

901
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:08,240
Long, loving kisses. They sat in 
the little house in the rocks.  

902
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:14,480
The soldier held her close. They 
talked and laughed and kissed again.  

903
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,960
And all the time Rafael watched and listened 
to them with black hate in his heart.

904
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:28,880
After that, Rafael followed the soldier 
every time he came to the village.  

905
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:36,640
The soldier did the same every time. Sometimes 
Anita didn't come to the place in the rocks.  

906
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:39,760
But the soldier always waited for her there.

907
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:46,560
Then Rafael knew how to kill 
the soldier. It was a good plan.

908
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:53,600
The next time the soldier came to 
the village, Rafael's plan was ready.  

909
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:01,680
The soldier arrived in the village that Sunday and 
went to Rodrigo's shop with the tin of paraffin.  

910
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:09,920
Rafael waited until it was dark. He saw the 
bright light of the lamp in Rodrigo's house.  

911
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:14,720
He watched the soldier start 
to eat the meal with Rodrigo.

912
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:22,400
He had everything that he needed in his boat. 
He sailed out quietly to the place in the rocks.  

913
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:31,040
The place where the soldier always waited. He took 
his boat close to the shore and tied it to a rock.  

914
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:40,320
Then he went on foot to old Santiago's farm. The 
old donkey was standing sleeping in its field.  

915
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:45,040
Rafael walked with it down 
to the beach near his boat.  

916
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:53,040
It wasn't very far. There he took the old 
donkey into the water, and then killed it.

917
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:59,680
He put the dead animal into his 
boat and went out into deeper water.  

918
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:04,560
He went to the place where the 
soldier usually left his boat.  

919
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,880
There he began to cut up the dead 
donkey, throwing the pieces into the sea.  

920
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:19,120
He and the boat were soon covered in the donkey's 
blood. But there was much more blood in the water  

921
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:25,520
all round the boat. Rafael knew that the 
sharks, far away in the sea, could smell it.

922
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:33,120
Rafael kept the back legs of the 
donkey in his boat. He took a long,  

923
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:39,520
strong piece of line and tied the legs to it. 
Then he sailed quietly back to the village.  

924
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,480
There was no moon that night, 
only the light from the stars.  

925
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:49,040
Soon he could see the beach 
and the houses of the village.  

926
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:56,480
The lamp was still burning in Rodrigo's house. The 
soldier's boat was a few metres from the shore.  

927
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:01,760
It was always in the same place. The 
soldier didn't want to break his engine.

928
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,520
Rafael moved his boat close to 
the soldier's boat and stopped.  

929
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:15,360
He went into the dark water and swam across to 
it. He had the end of the line in his teeth.  

930
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:23,680
He tied it to the bottom of the soldier's boat. 
Then he swam back to his boat and put the legs  

931
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:30,880
of the donkey quietly into the water. Now, the 
soldier's boat had the smell of blood behind it.

932
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:39,760
Rafael took his boat to the far end of the beach 
in front of his house. He pulled it half on to  

933
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:45,520
the sand, and began to wash the donkey's blood 
from the bottom of the boat. He washed some  

934
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:50,960
of the blood from his clothes in the sea. But 
there was a lot of blood and water in the boat.

935
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:55,280
Suddenly his mother came with an oil lamp.  

936
01:44:56,160 --> 01:45:01,840
She saw the blood on his clothes and in 
the boat. She was afraid he was hurt.

937
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:11,520
'Don't be afraid, mother,' he said. 'I'm not hurt. 
This isn't my blood. I've killed the soldier.'

938
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:19,200
It was true. The soldier wasn't yet 
dead, but Rafael's plans were made.

939
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:28,960
Rafael wasn't afraid to tell his mother. She 
always kept his secrets. She was very calm when  

940
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:35,760
he told her. She sent him to the house to change 
his clothes. She stayed and cleaned the boat.

941
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:41,280
When he went to the cafe, 
he found the soldier there.  

942
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:46,960
He was surprised. He thought the soldier 
was spending the evening with Rodrigo.  

943
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:53,840
Rafael looked at the soldier, his enemy. He 
was smiling and laughing with his friends.  

944
01:45:55,600 --> 01:46:03,200
Rafael thought, 'The sharks are already waiting 
for you. Tonight you're going to your death.'

945
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,840
The soldier left in the middle of the evening.  

946
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:13,040
He went out to his boat, started 
the engine and went off to the west.

947
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:20,960
Rafael stayed in the cafe, listening to the 
music. He was afraid, but he was excited, too.  

948
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:29,200
When he heard the music, he began 
to dance to the songs. Eyes closed,  

949
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:37,200
he saw in his head the soldier's boat. It 
went through the dark night. Behind it,  

950
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:45,360
the red line of blood, dark in the water. The 
engine stopped. The boat came quietly back  

951
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:51,680
to the secret place in the rocks. The soldier 
waited in the moonlight, smoking a cigarette.  

952
01:46:53,120 --> 01:47:01,200
Perhaps, then, he jumped into the dark sea for a 
swim. Something was waiting there, something big  

953
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:08,720
and hungry. It moved fast through the water. 
Perhaps there was time for one short scream.  

954
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:17,840
Then all was quiet again. The dark waters 
were calm. And the soldier was gone for ever.

955
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:24,320
Rafael danced and smiled 
and saw these pictures again  

956
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:28,560
and again. He stayed and danced until midnight.

957
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:33,520
Then he went back to his house and went to bed.  

958
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:41,600
But he slept only for a few hours. Before 
the first light of day, he got up quietly  

959
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:48,080
and went out of the house. He took his boat 
along the coast to find the soldier's boat.

960
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:58,800
The boat was there in the place in the rocks. It 
lay empty and quiet in the water. Rafael looked  

961
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:05,600
for the soldier in the sea and on the land. But 
there was no sign of him. Nothing was left of him.  

962
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:13,600
Rafael saw the long shadows of sharks still 
swimming in the water near the boat. The boat's  

963
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:20,240
engine was above the water. There was a long 
piece of fishing line tied many times round it.

964
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:22,880
Rafael laughed.

965
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:28,240
'My plan was better than I 
thought,' he said to himself.  

966
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:33,680
'I tied the legs of the old donkey 
to his boat with some fishing line.  

967
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:41,920
And the line also stopped the engine. So the 
soldier had to go into the water to untie it.'

968
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:49,600
Rafael took the soldier's boat far 
from the shore. There he made a hole  

969
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:56,560
in the bottom and pushed it under the water. 
Soon it went down to the bottom of the sea.

970
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:04,160
Rafael was happy. The soldier and his 
boat were at the bottom of the sea.  

971
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:11,840
Nobody knew what happened to him. He 
went back to the village and into the  

972
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:17,120
house to have an early breakfast. 
Suddenly he was very hungry.
 
 
 

973
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:23,760
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

974
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:27,840
The Truth, at Last

975
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:37,280
A little later (Rafael told me), he and 
his mother heard the shouting and screaming  

976
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:43,440
from Rodrigo's house. They soon learned that 
Anita was nowhere in the house or the village.  

977
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:50,480
Rafael smiled to himself. Perhaps Anita was 
still waiting somewhere for her soldier.  

978
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,840
'She can wait forever. She'll 
never see him again,' he thought.

979
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:05,360
'I'll sail along the coast and look for her,' he 
told his mother. In fact, he wanted to go to a  

980
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:09,840
quiet place to wash his boat again. There 
was still some dark blood in the bottom.

981
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,080
He went back to the place in the rocks. 

982
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:20,720
It was calm and quiet there. The soldier's 
boat was at the bottom of the sea.  

983
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:25,520
Rafael took some water from 
the sea to wash his boat.  

984
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:34,960
A small shark swam slowly under it. Almost without 
thinking, Rafael picked up his fishing spear.  

985
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:43,680
He hit the shark hard through the back of the 
head. Its blood came out into the clear water. A  

986
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:50,480
few other sharks, bigger ones, smelt the blood and 
came fast through the water. They began to bite at  

987
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:56,720
the dying fish with their great, sharp teeth. They 
fought, biting great pieces off the dead shark.

988
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:02,320
Rafael decided to catch one or 
two and cut them up in his boat.  

989
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:06,240
He wanted their blood to be 
in the boat with the donkey's.

990
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,840
A white shark about three metres 
long was pulling at the dead one.  

991
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:18,240
If lay in the water next to the boat, 
not moving. Rafael killed it with his  

992
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:24,160
spear and put a line round its head. Then 
he pulled it into the bottom of the boat.

993
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:30,240
Rafael took his knife and cut 
the shark open from neck to tail.  

994
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:37,760
Pieces of meat, fish and hair from its Stomach 
fell out into the bottom of the boat. There  

995
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:43,200
was a large piece of donkey skin with its 
grey hair. Rafael moved it with his knife.

996
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:48,160
In that second, the world stopped.  

997
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:55,200
Rafael's blood seemed to freeze inside 
him. The sky went dark. He couldn't move.

998
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:02,800
In the pile of meat and fish in the 
bottom of the boat there was a hand.

999
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:11,520
A complete hand, white and clean. 
It was cut off at the wrist with one  

1000
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:20,880
clean bite. It was a small hand, with small, 
pretty fingers. The fingernails were long and  

1001
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:25,200
pink. They weren't bitten or 
dirty or broken by housework.

1002
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:34,880
And on the middle finger of the hand was a 
gold ring, a ring in the shape of a golden fish

1003
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:48,000
Rafael gave one great scream. He held his head 
in his hands. He knew now where Anita was.  

1004
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:54,640
The night before, when the engine of 
the soldier's boat stopped working,  

1005
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:02,080
she was there in the boat with him. Then he 
went into the water to look at the engine.  

1006
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:08,880
She stayed in the boat. She saw him, when 
the sharks killed him in the dark water.  

1007
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:16,880
Perhaps she tried to pull him into the boat. 
But then she too fell into the blood-red water.  

1008
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:23,760
And there she spent the last terrible seconds 
of her life with her true prince, the soldier.

1009
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:31,520
Rafael knew he couldn't continue living. 
He couldn't live with this terrible secret.  

1010
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:39,840
He stood up in the boat and called Anita's 
name. Then he threw himself into the sea.  

1011
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:46,560
He lay in the water, face down. He waited 
for the sharp teeth in the mouths of the  

1012
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:55,680
sharks to pull him down to his death. But they 
didn't. He felt them in the water all round him.  

1013
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:02,240
Sometimes he felt them push against 
him. But they didn't hurt him.

1014
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:12,640
Then Rafael understood. God didn't want him 
to die this way. An easy death. A quick death.  

1015
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:21,840
Too quick and easy for a murderer. He was 
terribly afraid. He tried to kill himself.  

1016
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:27,120
He held his face under the water 
and tried to die. But he couldn't.

1017
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:32,160
At last he climbed back into the boat.  

1018
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:39,040
He sat like a dead man and looked at 
the little hand with the gold ring.  

1019
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:47,600
After a long time he took the ring carefully 
from her finger. He took a piece of fishing  

1020
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:57,680
line and tied the ring round his neck. He had 
his ring again. He had it from Anita's own hand.  

1021
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:07,520
'I'll keep it with me forever,' he thought. 
'Then I will never forget my terrible crime.'

1022
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,320
He threw the dead shark back into the sea.

1023
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:19,280
Then, last of all, he took the cold white hand.  

1024
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:27,760
He held it in his own hand for the last time. 
Then he put it carefully into the water.

1025
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:34,720
Then he lay down in the bottom of the 
boat holding the ring at his neck.  

1026
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:45,840
And he looked at the bright sky and talked 
to Anita. And they laughed and laughed...

1027
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:47,920
***

1028
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:54,880
I took Rafael's body back to his village. He 
lies in the ground near that place in the rocks.  

1029
01:55:55,600 --> 01:56:03,360
The secret place where he and Anita spent many 
happy hours. I put the gold ring round his neck.  

1030
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:10,000
The ring that he took from Anita's dead 
hand. It will stay with him forever.

1031
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:18,880
Nobody in the village knows what he 
did. Not Rodrigo, not my uncle or Rosa.  

1032
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:27,840
They still believe that Anita and the 
soldier are living somewhere far away.

1033
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:39,680
I can see no reason to tell 
them anything different.
 
 
 
 

1034
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:40,242
- THE END -
