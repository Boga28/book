00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,941
CHAPTER ONE
A Nose for a Story

2
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:10,990
'Are you OK Miss?' asked the taxi driver.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,349
He could see in his mirror that the American
lady sitting in the back seat, was having

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:20,289
a hard time keeping down her expensive lunch.

5
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:23,429
'No, I am not!

6
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,470
What is that awful smell?'

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,749
the woman asked.

8
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:31,979
The taxi driver smiled to himself.

9
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:37,390
He often had to explain the smell to wealthy
foreigners after he had driven them a kilometre

10
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,970
or so away from their hotel.

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,370
It was not something their sensitive city
noses were used to.

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,830
'It's just the sewage, Miss.

13
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:55,430
The pipes from the toilets are old and the
weather is hot in India,' he explained.

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:02,690
'There are many people in Bombay - the pipes
get very full.'

15
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,100
The taxi driver almost felt sorry for his
passenger.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,939
She was middle-aged but had a pretty face
and shiny dark hair, though her teeth were

17
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:16,870
too big for his taste.

18
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:22,509
Yet he could see as he closed the windows
and switched on the air- conditioning that

19
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:25,409
many men would find her attractive.

20
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,729
But he had long since learned to distance
himself from the delights of his lady passengers.

21
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,560
He thought of himself as a professional, like
a doctor.

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,639
He was above such things.

23
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:47,509
'Don't worry, Miss; there are no more big
sewage pipes in the village where we are going,'

24
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,649
he added, helpfully.

25
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:57,229
'Thank God for that!' said the woman, who
was now beginning to wish she had not asked

26
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:00,930
for the windows to be left open in the first
place.

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,469
'No, they use cesspits - big holes in the
ground where they put all their-'

28
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,820
Thank you, driver,' the woman said quickly.

29
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,780
'There's no need to go into details.

30
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,300
I can imagine.'

31
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,470
Desiree Malpen, in fact, had one of the best
imaginations in her business.

32
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,310
She was a senior journalist for the National
Diary, a publication which was proud of being

33
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:37,660
America's 'number one magazine for lovers
of the truth'.

34
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,810
Other journalists who wrote for more serious
newspapers disagreed.

35
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:49,530
They said that the National Diary loved scandal
and dirt and didn't care how much it changed

36
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,890
the truth in its stories.

37
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,480
The journalists were right.

38
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,690
Lots of pictures and lots of scandal - that
was the National Diary's recipe for success

39
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:07,950
- and Desiree was one of the magazine's top
writers.

40
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:15,210
The taxi drove on a long way outside the city
until the road became rougher.

41
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,790
Finally it stopped by a small group of houses
off the side of the road.

42
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,200
'This is the place, Miss.

43
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,900
It's the house to the left,' said the driver.

44
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,680
He pointed to a house that was slightly larger
than the rest and still had some white paint

45
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,240
on its walls.

46
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,490
'But it's so small!'

47
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,750
Desiree said in surprise.

48
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,620
'Best house in the village, Miss.

49
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:51,760
The family has been there many, many years,'
said the driver with some pride, as if he

50
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:59,040
knew the famous writer who had lived there,
though he had never met her in his life.

51
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,800
This was the house of the late Nyree Singh,
the former society beauty and writer, whose

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,490
highly praised novels had been made into several
films and who had won the Nobel Prize - or

53
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,870
was it the Pulitzer?

54
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,739
Desiree wasn't sure.

55
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,220
She had never read any of her books.

56
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,310
She knew, however, that Nyree Singh had been
killed two months ago in a car crash just

57
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,940
outside Bombay.

58
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,410
Some people said she had been driving to the
house of an Indian film star - a married film

59
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,630
star.

60
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,880
Desiree felt sure that the crash had been
no accident.

61
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,180
It wouldn't be the first time that such 'accidents'
had been arranged.

62
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,520
Perhaps there was a jealous wife involved...
or maybe an angry relative who could not stand

63
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,560
the scandal or embarrassment to the family
name?

64
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:10,470
She had a nose for a story and when Desiree
Malpen smelled a story there would be a story.

65
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,810
And if there were no facts behind the story
she would think of some.

66
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,570
She looked at the window of the house.

67
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,780
A figure was moving.

68
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,960
There was somebody still living in Nyree Singh's
house.

69
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,780
But who?

70
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:37,240
Desiree took a few close-up pictures of the
house - she always liked to take her own photographs.

71
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,630
They gave a personal touch to her stories
and made her some extra money.

72
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,280
'That's fine.

73
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,550
Take me back to the hotel now, driver.

74
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,560
I'll come back sometime and take a closer
look.

75
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,169
And driver...'

76
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,580
'Yes, Miss?'

77
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,520
'Next time I ask you to open the windows for
some fresh air, don't!'

78
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,860
Desiree said decisively.

79
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,980
While Desiree was going back to her hotel
in the taxi, Gopal Singh was looking at the

80
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,790
old brown photograph of his younger sister,
Nyree.

81
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:24,150
It sat on the table next to the sweet-smelling
flowers he replaced daily.

82
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:30,340
She looked as he would always remember her
- a beautiful young woman whose intelligence

83
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,080
shone far beyond her own country.

84
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,460
She was only forty-five when she died in that
car accident, still beautiful and with so

85
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,260
much still to give.

86
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,790
She had been respected by artists and politicians
all over the world.

87
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,960
Yes, he was proud of his sister.

88
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,330
But she used to get so angry!

89
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,470
He laughed.

90
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,760
It was easier to laugh now.

91
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,889
Oh, the times they had argued over the company
she sometimes kept.

92
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,830
Gopal had not always liked the people she
mixed with.

93
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,100
Still, they had always been there for each
other.

94
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,220
Neither of them had married.

95
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,000
She was married to her work.

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,010
He had always looked after her, though he
would never have admitted it to his proud

97
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:32,060
brilliant sister who, in many ways, had been
a child still.

98
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,100
She was too idealistic, only interested in
those who shared her ideals.

99
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:44,240
She would argue her opinions with anybody,
but her beauty sometimes attracted lovers

100
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,509
as well as thinkers.

101
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:51,009
She could not be trusted to look after herself
and who else was there?

102
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:56,380
They were the only ones left of their family.

103
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:04,600
Only he had known Nyree: only he had understood
her ways, her needs - perhaps more than she

104
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,639
did herself.

105
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,669
And now she was gone.

106
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:16,150
People seemed to want her even more since
her death.

107
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:21,350
But it was still Gopal who looked after her
memory and her work.

108
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,669
He kept away all the journalists and other
people who wanted a part of his sister to

109
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:28,080
take away with them.

110
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,500
She had given them-" her work, her wonderful
books.

111
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,450
Why should they want the part of her that
was left to him, the part that was his sister?

112
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,970
She had put her life into her work.

113
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,820
Wasn't that enough for them?

114
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,390
Gopal had always been there for her.

115
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,230
Even when she had mixed with the most famous
people in India, she had always come back

116
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,730
to her faithful brother and their peaceful
little home in the village.

117
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,620
Always.

118
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:08,170
Now there was a growing number of curious
eyes, cars that stopped and looked, tapping

119
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,770
on the windows, notes through the door.

120
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,770
What did they want?

121
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,420
Didn't they know she was dead?

122
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,100
But he would stay.

123
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:26,420
He would end his days in the house that held
his memories wrapped in the sweet smell of

124
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,500
flowers.

125
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,570
What else could he want?

126
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,300
The Excelsior hotel was famous for its quality
and luxury.

127
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,480
It was the place to stay at if you were at
all important or wanted to be thought of as

128
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,600
being important.

129
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,240
It was always full of foreign journalists.

130
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,710
Whenever they were working in Bombay, foreign
journalists always chose the Excelsior.

131
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:01,040
Its attraction to journalists was obvious:
it was a good place for both valuable information

132
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,190
and scandal.

133
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,120
Who knows what famous guests might say after
too much wine at dinner?

134
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:16,330
And there were always keen listening ears
to catch every foolish word or careless whisper.

135
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:22,450
This would later be served up to the world
as a tasty dish of scandal in magazines like

136
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,760
the National Diary.

137
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,959
There were always plenty of readers hungry
for details of the lives of famous people,

138
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:35,820
especially if those details were interesting
and personal.

139
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,770
That was why Desiree Malpen was staying there.

140
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:48,000
That evening at the hotel, Desiree sat at
her table in the lounge looking at the setting

141
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,630
sun through the windows.

142
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,339
She was pleased with herself.

143
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:58,930
She kept a glass of white wine with her but
drank very little of it.

144
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,420
This was what she always did.

145
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,040
It meant that she could refuse offers of drinks
from interested men while keeping a cl ear

146
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,100
head herself.

147
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:15,290
She was very good at listening to people who
first drank too much and then said too much.

148
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:21,700
On the few occasions when the conversation
went from the boring to the exciting, she

149
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:28,480
could reach into her handbag and switch on
her tiny tape recorder - a very useful machine

150
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,880
indeed.

151
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,839
Desiree was there to interview one of India's
top film directors, Raj Patel.

152
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:45,840
He was about to make a film based on Indian
Summer, Nyree Singh's last novel.

153
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:52,180
The Indian film industry, centered in Bombay,
was becoming popular in the West, where it

154
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,560
was sometimes known as 'Bollywood'.

155
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:02,740
Desiree had no interest at all in Indian films
or their directors, but her boss had told

156
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:09,110
her that she might find out more about Nyree
Singh and her film star lover.

157
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:14,720
If anybody knew him, Patel did.

158
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,899
She recognised Patel coming towards her.

159
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:25,360
He was quite old, well over sixty - Desiree
preferred younger men - and was dressed in

160
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,250
an expensive white suit.

161
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,330
He was smiling and holding a gin and tonic.

162
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,530
Desiree knew that older men were attracted
to her.

163
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:44,690
It was useful, though it could be risky if
she stayed too long and they became too interested.

164
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,980
She could see already that Patel's eyes were
attracted by the necklace that sat above the

165
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,779
low neckline of her dress.

166
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:55,000
But she could handle herself all right.

167
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,459
This guy would be no problem, she could tell.

168
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,350
Patel came up to her and smiled.

169
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,959
'Miss Malpen, if I'm not mistaken...?'

170
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,520
Desiree held out her hand as she welcomed
him.

171
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,769
She was expecting a handshake but Patel took
it and gave it a kiss instead.

172
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:19,550
It felt wet.

173
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:25,590
'They didn't tell me you were so handsome,
Mr Patel!'

174
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:32,840
'You know how to please an old man, Miss Malpen,'
Patel said as he laughed.

175
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:39,560
'But I was surprised when your magazine said
it was interested in my latest film production.

176
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:46,140
In fact, I'm pleased that the West is finally
taking an interest in Indian cinema.'

177
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:53,510
'The whole world knows that you beat Hollywood
in getting the rights to film Nyree Singh's

178
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,930
last novel, Indian Summer.

179
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:03,820
Naturally, everybody wants to know about it,
especially since Nyree Singh's death,' said

180
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,120
Desiree as she switched on her tape recorder.

181
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,340
'Well, I've always wanted to film Nyree's
novels.

182
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:18,540
I think it's best that her work should be
filmed by Indians in India.'

183
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:27,560
'I hear that Nyree had quite an interest in
Indian films... and in film stars.

184
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,360
Is that right, Mr Patel?'

185
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,610
And so the conversation went on.

186
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:42,730
Raj Patel wanted to talk about his new film
but Desiree wanted to talk about Nyree Singh

187
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:49,620
and kept trying to get him to give away details
of her involvement with one of his stars.

188
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:56,610
Throughout it all, Patel simply smiled, drank
his gin and tonic and kept trying to return

189
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,890
to the subject of his film.

190
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:06,990
But Desiree was determined and the subject
always went back to Nyree's personal life.

191
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,490
Finally he stood up.

192
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,630
'Will you excuse me for a few moments, Miss
Malpen?

193
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,920
I won't be long.'

194
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,839
He had a phone call to make that he didn't
want her to know about.

195
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,890
And he left.

196
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,520
Desiree waited and sipped her wine.

197
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:33,630
She was annoyed that the old fool hadn't told
her about anything apart from his boring film.

198
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,430
He was back half an hour later.

199
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,899
He seemed to be a little drunk.

200
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:42,279
Desiree tried not to appear annoyed.

201
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:50,899
'Ah, yes, Miss Malpen - you were interested
in Nyree Singh.'

202
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:55,149
Patel's voice was louder than before and not
as clear.

203
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:57,529
'And who can blame you?

204
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:05,040
By the way, that is a most beautiful necklace
you are wearing, my dear.'

205
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,640
'You were saying about Nyree Singh...'

206
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,660
Desiree reminded him.

207
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,500
'Ah yes, Nyree...

208
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,820
She was a remarkable woman - a woman who could
have told the world a lot about the famous

209
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,140
people she knew.

210
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,580
I knew her well.'

211
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,800
Desiree's eyes opened wider.

212
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,150
Nyree Singh's secrecy and hatred of publicity
had been well known.

213
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,610
'Really?

214
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:44,390
And did she tell you about... her secrets?'

215
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,730
'Not at all.'

216
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:55,140
Desiree almost got very angry but decided
that silence was the best approach.

217
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,040
She was right.

218
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:06,920
'But,' he continued, leaning over towards
Desiree, 'she once told me, as her friend,

219
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,650
that she kept a diary.

220
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:16,910
"If the world only knew the secrets that I
have written in this diary" she said to me,

221
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,930
"they would be shocked."'

222
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,750
'Shocked?'

223
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,390
said Desiree.

224
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,059
Patel looked at her with a concerned expression.

225
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:37,220
'If that diary were shown to the world, I
tell you, there would be scandal.

226
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,030
Scandal!

227
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,810
Some people would be in serious trouble, I
tell you!

228
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:48,960
It's a good job her brother keeps it safe,
or there would be a lot of respectable public

229
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,970
figures who would be...'

230
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,730
'She has a brother?'

231
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,730
'Oh, yes.

232
00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:02,520
Her older brother, Gopal - her only relation.

233
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,590
He was like a father to her.

234
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:11,460
Yes, he has all her things, including that
diary.

235
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,549
It's safe in his hands.

236
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:21,780
He's just a lonely old man who lives for his
memories of his sister.

237
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,990
He'll probably get rid of it sooner or later.'

238
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,429
'Get rid of it?'

239
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:32,150
thought Desiree.

240
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,309
'Not if I can help it!'

241
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:44,929
While Desiree was deep in conversation with
Patel, Professor Cyril Whitelaw was enjoying

242
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:53,160
a cool glass of iced lemon tea in his small
but comfortable room at the Excelsior.

243
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,770
He was celebrating his first day in India
by reading Indian Summer, the last novel by

244
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,650
Nyree Singh, for the sixth time.

245
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:08,600
He would have to know her works in detail
if he was to write a great book about this

246
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,450
secretive author's life.

247
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:17,500
His publishers were paying for everything
and expected results.

248
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,580
He hoped to see the house where she had spent
so many years of her life very soon.

249
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,910
Who knows what he might find there?

250
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:34,640
Perhaps - and this was his secret hope - he
might find some unpublished writings!

251
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,340
The thought made him shake with excitement.

252
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:46,800
Whitelaw put down Indian Summer and his lemon
tea and got up from his chair.

253
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,360
He then played one of his favourite games
- looking in the mirror and imagining his

254
00:19:52,360 --> 00:20:00,850
face on the back cover of his important future
book: Nyree Singh - Secretive Star, the book

255
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:07,290
that would finally make his name as an expert
on serious modern literature.

256
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:13,400
The thin face that looked back at him was
that of a man of late middle age, with pale

257
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,620
red hair and glasses.

258
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:23,290
Its skin was pink from the heat and was already
showing the first signs of sunburn.

259
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,530
It needed a shave.

260
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,720
He decided to clean himself up and dress for
dinner.

261
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,500
After that he would have a drink in the hotel
lounge.

262
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:41,660
'You never know,' he thought, 'there might
be someone out there who knew her!'

263
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:48,010
Twenty minutes later he walked into the lounge
of the Excelsior, where nobody knew Professor

264
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,970
Cyril Whitelaw.

265
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,679
At least, not yet.

266
00:20:53,679 --> 00:21:00,370
'My dear Miss Malpen...' began Patel.

267
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,160
'Call me Desiree, please.'

268
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,700
'Of course...

269
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,970
Desiree.

270
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:17,350
May I please introduce my brightest star,
my finest actor and leading man, Ravi Narayan.

271
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,559
He's going to star in my new film - Indian
Summer.

272
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:30,200
I've always wanted to make a film of my favourite
book by my dear friend Nyree Singh - and now

273
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,880
I am.'

274
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:39,940
'You naughty man, Raj!' said Desiree, giving
Patel a playful tap on the wrist.

275
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,120
'You didn't tell me we had another good-looking
man in the hotel!

276
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,830
Why, he's almost as handsome as you!'

277
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,200
Patel laughed.

278
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,650
They all did.

279
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,310
It was a game Desiree was good at playing
with older men.

280
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:04,410
But this other man was not a day over forty
and yes, he was handsome.

281
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:09,940
But where had she seen him before?

282
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:17,210
Ravi Narayan smiled with white film-star teeth
and said how pleased he was to meet her.

283
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,480
The voice was familiar, too.

284
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,150
That was when Desiree remembered him.

285
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,929
His handsome face had been the only thing
that had kept her awake through viewings of

286
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,340
Patel's boring films.

287
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:36,280
Her editor had insisted she watch them as
preparation for this interview.

288
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,880
She was glad she had decided to put on her
best perfume after all.

289
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,020
Perhaps it had been worth it.

290
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:51,370
Now there was another link with Nyree Singh
- perhaps he had been her film star boyfriend!

291
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:58,030
'I thought that Hollywood was interested in
filming that book, Raj.

292
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:04,530
I don't mean to be rude but why are you making
it and not them?'

293
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:10,560
It was a fair question and Desiree was curious
to know the answer.

294
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,750
'It's all thanks to Nyree's brother.

295
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,309
He is responsible for all her books now.

296
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:19,850
And he likes my films.

297
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,850
He wants the film made in India by Indians.

298
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,350
By this Indian!'

299
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,590
Patel pointed to himself and laughed loudly.

300
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,000
They all laughed.

301
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,309
Their conversation was being listened to by
a very interested figure with pale red hair

302
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:47,250
and glasses who was sitting by the bar not
far away, unnoticed by them, busily writing

303
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,020
in a notebook.

304
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,140
It was Professor Whitelaw.

305
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,809
'Yes indeed.

306
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:58,580
I've known him for years,' continued Patel.

307
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,809
'He's spent his life looking after his sister.

308
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:05,120
He still lives in their old house in the village.

309
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:12,590
Goodness knows, Nyree had enough money to
buy a palace but she insisted on staying there.

310
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,220
She said it kept her feet on the ground.

311
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,880
But it was Gopal who did that, if you ask
me.

312
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,220
He is getting old now, though, and his health
is getting worse but he won't move from the

313
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,549
place,' said Patel.

314
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:35,650
'So he decides what happens to her books?'
asked Desiree.

315
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,830
'Yes.

316
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,530
There must be lots of unpublished stuff there.

317
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,600
Including that diary I mentioned.

318
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:51,210
I'd love to have a look but Gopal won't let
anyone near - he's no fool,' said Patel as

319
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,520
he gave her a knowing look.

320
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:02,580
'Neither am I,' thought Desiree, who was already
making plans to visit Gopal the next day.

321
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,159
She was determined to get that diary one way
or another.

322
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:17,049
'But there I go talking about an old man,'
went on Patel, 'when you have handsome Ravi

323
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,090
to entertain you.

324
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:24,400
Did I mention he was to star in my next film?'

325
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,090
Handsome Ravi talked about himself for the
next hour or two, long after Whitelaw was

326
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,500
gone.

327
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:37,250
It soon became clear that Ravi had never even
met Nyree Singh.

328
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:44,870
And he didn't seem to notice Desiree's necklace
at all.

329
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:51,500
The next morning, Gopal Singh was looking
at the rising sun from his bedroom window.

330
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:58,440
He was glad he had agreed to let his old friend
Raj film Indian Summer.

331
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,870
Nyree had always said that foreigners should
film her books because only they could see

332
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,200
India with a fresh eye.

333
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,059
He had always told her that was nonsense.

334
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:16,210
They had argued about it but what, in the
end, could he say?

335
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:20,190
They were not his books and that was that.

336
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,460
But now he was responsible.

337
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,840
He would do what was best.

338
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,150
At last.

339
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:35,470
The previous night, Raj had told him on the
phone that a silly journalist from that awful

340
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,039
National Diary magazine wanted to see him.

341
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:46,570
Raj, as Gopal well knew, had always liked
attractive women - his marriage never changed

342
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:51,200
that - but even he knew trouble when he saw
it.

343
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,910
And Desiree Malpen was trouble.

344
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,370
No doubt about that.

345
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,490
She was not interested in Indian films.

346
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,030
That was for sure.

347
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:09,110
So Raj had, with Gopal's permission, made
up a story about a diary full of scandals

348
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,990
about important people.

349
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:18,880
Raj had been a good actor in his youth so,
while he was talking to Desiree, he had pretended

350
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,480
to be drunk and to be talking too much - he
was good at that kind of thing.

351
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:32,460
And she had believed every word, just as he
had expected her to!

352
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:40,450
Of course, Raj and Gopal both knew that Nyree
had never kept a diary in her life.

353
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:46,470
He remembered Gopal once telling him about
Nyree's little box of secrets, so he had quickly

354
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,850
thought of the plan.

355
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:55,120
They had realised that the filming of Indian
Summer would attract interest outside India

356
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,230
and not all of it welcome.

357
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,530
Desiree Malpen was a good example.

358
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:08,549
Raj told Gopal he could either send her away
or he could carry out the joke.

359
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:15,510
If she was more interested in scandal than
his films she should not get any pity.

360
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,279
Gopal laughed and told him to go ahead.

361
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,330
Good old Raj!

362
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:28,190
Desiree had also got up early that morning.

363
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:34,250
Ravi Narayan had proved to be as good a talker
as she was a listener.

364
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,429
Perhaps better.

365
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:42,820
Old Patel had smiled as he allowed his star
to talk and talk and talk.

366
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,309
Her cassette had soon finished and she hadn't
got another.

367
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:53,440
She had hoped to catch more details about
Nyree Singh and her diary.

368
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,919
Oh yes, there had been a lot mentioned - famous
names, important names from all over the place

369
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:06,640
- when Ravi took a breath and allowed Patel
to talk for a while.

370
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:14,210
This had not been often enough to please her,
but by then her interest had been awakened.

371
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:19,170
She was sure there was a story - and a big
one, too.

372
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:24,059
And as for Nyree's death in that so-called
car accident!

373
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,299
Had it really been an accident?

374
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:33,169
There was the smell of scandal there, she
just knew it!

375
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:39,360
She had phoned Nyree's brother and told him
she wanted to get out quickly to see him.

376
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,030
She was sure that old Gopal, or whatever his
name was, would be as helpful as Patel had

377
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:49,679
been, especially if he was a lonely old man.

378
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,340
How could he refuse an attractive woman like
her?

379
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,740
The diary would be hers.

380
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,960
She was sure of it.

381
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,630
Even if she had to steal it.

382
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:08,270
She decided she would wear a yellow trouser
suit that would allow her to move freely around

383
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:13,679
the place - she wanted to have a good look
around when she got there.

384
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,150
She looked great in the trouser suit and her
appearance usually helped her get what she

385
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,610
wanted.

386
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,620
That and lots of nice perfume, of course.

387
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,000
One had to smell nice.

388
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,210
Five minutes later she was on her way in a
taxi.

389
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:39,020
She had all the windows closed.

390
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,220
Later that morning Gopal Singh went out to
change the flowers for fresh ones from the

391
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,730
garden.

392
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,990
The house needed the sweet smell.

393
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:55,299
It had not been joined to the sewage system
- it was an old house and still had no modern

394
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:57,440
pipes.

395
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:04,100
Waste was collected every month from a cesspit
some distance away in the large garden.

396
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:10,549
The cesspit was about two meters wide and
over one meter deep and by the end of the

397
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:14,720
month - as it was now - it smelled awful.

398
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,010
But he was used to it.

399
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:25,850
As he walked down the garden he saw a man
approaching, a middle-aged European man with

400
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,730
glasses and pale red hair.

401
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,790
'Mr Singh?' said the man.

402
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,320
'May I have a word with you?

403
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,070
It's about your sister.'

404
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:44,830
Gopal was always polite to visitors - if he
liked the look of them.

405
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,480
This man didn't look as if he meant any harm.

406
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,429
He decided to speak with him.

407
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:58,120
Professor Whitelaw introduced himself and
they were soon sitting in the house, drinking

408
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,970
tea next to the new flowers.

409
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,060
Whitelaw explained about his plans for a book
about Nyree.

410
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:16,110
'It will be mostly about her work, you understand,'
he said, rather nervously.

411
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,860
'Not about my sister's private life, I hope?

412
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:27,909
Nyree was a very private person and I want
that to be respected, even now,' Gopal said

413
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:29,070
firmly.

414
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:36,360
'I would never mention anything without your
permission, sir,' the professor said.

415
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:45,120
'This will be the kind of book students of
serious literature will read, I assure you.'

416
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,820
Gopal felt happier when he heard this.

417
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,740
Nyree had always attracted both students and
teachers of literature.

418
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,750
And there had to be a book sooner or later
- it was bound to happen.

419
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:04,330
When he heard Whitelaw tell him about his
plans to write a book that would celebrate

420
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:10,510
her work rather than the details of her private
life, he knew that it would probably be the

421
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,490
first of many.

422
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,960
Gopal also knew that he was getting older
and might not be able to control the things

423
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,929
that were written about Nyree.

424
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:27,549
If he insisted on having a considerable degree
of control over the finished book, he could

425
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:33,279
make sure that what was written was the truth
and not the rubbish that some would like to

426
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,530
publish about her.

427
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:40,779
Besides, Whitelaw seemed to be honest.

428
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:46,840
'And what kind of information about my sister
are you looking for, Professor Whitelaw?'

429
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,390
Gopal asked.

430
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:58,309
'I'm particularly interested in any unpublished
work you might have - any notes, unfinished

431
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:01,350
novels, letters...

432
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,400
diaries, perhaps?'

433
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,929
Diaries!

434
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:10,079
Gopal wondered if this was another of Raj's
jokes.

435
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,369
But Raj had made no mention of this man.

436
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:17,599
Then there was a knock at the door.

437
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,149
Gopal opened it.

438
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:25,159
There was an attractive woman in a yellow
trouser suit standing there.

439
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,200
She was smiling and carried a handbag.

440
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,729
He could smell her perfume.

441
00:34:31,729 --> 00:34:36,039
This must be the woman from the National Diary.

442
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,869
Gopal smiled and let her in.

443
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:45,720
Desiree thought the old man was smiling for
a different reason.

444
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,929
'He's attracted to me,' she thought to herself.

445
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:54,579
'I knew he would be!'

446
00:34:54,579 --> 00:35:00,420
Gopal introduced Whitelaw and Desiree's heart
sank when she saw him.

447
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,170
She was not glad to hear of his plans for
a book - he would be as interested in scandal

448
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,700
as she was.

449
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,410
Maybe she could take his mind off the diary.

450
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:18,349
She put on her sweetest voice, but Whitelaw
did not react as she had hoped.

451
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:23,630
He didn't look once as she leaned over while
reaching for some tea.

452
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,219
She might just as well have been his mother.

453
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:28,890
No luck there.

454
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:34,200
At least the old man seemed to be giving her
his attention.

455
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,559
She explained, still in her sweetest voice,
why she was there.

456
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:47,319
She said that she wanted to describe the human
side of Nyree Singh in her magazine, the side

457
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:52,599
that would show the world what a wonderful
person they had lost.

458
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:56,009
Was there anything that he could show her
readers?

459
00:35:56,009 --> 00:35:57,269
Letters?

460
00:35:57,269 --> 00:36:00,450
A diary, perhaps?

461
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,400
Gopal smiled.

462
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,579
'Come, let us all walk together in the garden.

463
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:12,029
Then we can talk,' he said.

464
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:19,920
Gopal picked up an old metal box from a table,
the kind with a lid and a lock, and carried

465
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,960
it with him.

466
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:28,959
He led them past the flowers by his sister's
photograph and out to the garden path.

467
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:31,390
There was an unpleasant smell.

468
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:36,079
At first the smell was not too bad.

469
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,049
Then, as they went on, it got stronger.

470
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:46,079
'My sister was a secretive woman,' said Gopal.

471
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,369
'She knew many important people, many famous
people.

472
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:58,339
But she never said anything about her private
conversations with them to me or to anyone.

473
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:04,680
She respected her friends - even her enemies
- and would never repeat to anyone what they

474
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,809
said to her.'

475
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:11,979
As they walked the smell became almost too
much.

476
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:20,500
Desiree's face was turning pale and Professor
Whitelaw, too, was looking very uncomfortable.

477
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,170
Gopal went on.

478
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:29,079
'This box contains the only real secrets my
sister ever kept from me.

479
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:37,119
I once promised her I would never open it
and I never have, even though I have the key.'

480
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:44,160
He stopped and looked at his two guests, who
were both trying their best not to be sick.

481
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:52,069
'This cesspit, which you see in the ground
in front of us, is to be emptied tomorrow.

482
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:55,489
It contains the sewage from the past month...'

483
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:59,009
They could see it in front of them.

484
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:06,469
It was almost full, and the smell rose from
it like an evil ghost.

485
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:13,559
Then Gopal did an extraordinary thing: he
threw the box into the cesspit.

486
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:17,719
It went through the air and landed in the
middle.

487
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:26,720
Desiree and Whitelaw looked on helplessly
while the box sank slowly to the bottom, leaving

488
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,309
only a few bubbles in the brown liquid.

489
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:36,749
'If you really wish to know the secrets in
that box, they are yours.

490
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:40,140
I will be at the Excelsior this afternoon.

491
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:47,349
In fact, my good friend Mr Raj Patel will
be arriving to take me there at any moment.

492
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:53,109
The "person who brings me the box may collect
the key from me in the lounge of the hotel

493
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:58,289
at four o'clock this afternoon - just in time
for tea.

494
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:00,630
Goodbye for now, my friends.

495
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,200
It was a delight meeting you both.

496
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,249
Perhaps we shall meet again...'

497
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:13,609
And Gopal walked down the garden path and
left them there.

498
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:19,329
Their eyes went from him to the cesspit and
then to each other.

499
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:25,670
Both of them wanted the box and what was in
it, and there it lay, separated from them

500
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:33,259
by deep, bubbling brown sewage.

501
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:39,920
Raj Patel and Gopal sat drinking tea in the
Excelsior lounge at three forty-five that

502
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,260
afternoon.

503
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:46,010
Music from a string quartet was playing.

504
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,970
As they laughed together a third person came
to join them.

505
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,190
It was Professor Whitelaw.

506
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:59,359
'I'm sorry, Mr Singh, but I just couldn't
do it.

507
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,619
Not for anything.

508
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:04,109
I'm afraid I have rather a weak stomach.

509
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:10,599
Still, I don't suppose anything in that box
would have made much difference to a book

510
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,699
about Miss Singh as a writer...'

511
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:15,910
Gopal smiled.

512
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,749
'Quite right.

513
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:21,119
Think nothing of it, Professor Whitelaw.

514
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:28,259
I hope you did not mind my little test of
your... er... intentions!

515
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,420
I can see you are a man with high standards.

516
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,520
Now do sit down and join us for tea.

517
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:43,339
Let me introduce you to my good friend, Mr
Raj Patel; he is a very fine maker of Indian

518
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:44,339
films.'

519
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:53,859
For the next ten minutes they all chatted
about Whitelaw's ideas for his book, and Raj

520
00:40:53,859 --> 00:41:00,719
Patel's plans for Indian Summer starring Ravi
Narayan.

521
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:09,640
It was almost four o'clock when Desiree Malpen
arrived with an old metal box-in her hands.

522
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:16,259
She was wearing a loose blue dress and smelled
of strong perfume.

523
00:41:16,259 --> 00:41:23,650
But there was another smell mixed in with
it, a bitter unpleasant smell which defeated

524
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,940
all the efforts of the perfume to hide it.

525
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:33,660
Her hair was still wet as though she had just
come out of the shower.

526
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:38,349
She smiled but it was an angry smile.

527
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:46,099
She placed the box in the middle of the table,
almost knocking over the vase of roses.

528
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:51,279
'Well, Mr Singh, here it is.

529
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:52,709
I got it out.

530
00:41:52,709 --> 00:42:01,960
None of those taxi drivers would do it so
I did it myself - ruined my clothes and had

531
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,989
to pay for the damned taxi to be cleaned.

532
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:11,019
God knows what they thought when I finally
got back here!

533
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:14,089
But here it is.

534
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:16,859
Now are you going to open it?'

535
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:20,260
'Of course, my dear.

536
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,670
At once,' said Gopal.

537
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:31,729
He took a key from his pocket and didn't seem
to mind that the box was not entirely clean.

538
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:37,920
He turned the lock with a quick motion of
his wrist and held the box out to her.

539
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,609
'Take it; it's yours.'

540
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:49,690
Desiree took the box and, looking very pleased
with herself, opened it.

541
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:58,400
She took out some old pieces of newspaper,
which had gone brown and hard with age.

542
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,150
She looked at them and stared at Gopal angrily.

543
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:09,589
'What on earth are these?'

544
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:14,680
Gopal Singh looked at the old papers.

545
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,479
'Cricket reports!

546
00:43:17,479 --> 00:43:26,140
We both loved cricket, but I hate reading
results of matches I haven't seen - and Nyree

547
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,180
loved collecting them.

548
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,849
She was a sweet old thing, don't think?'

549
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:32,869
- THE END -
