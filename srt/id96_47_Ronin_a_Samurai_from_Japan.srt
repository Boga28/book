00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:12,420
Samurai
In the old days in Japan, the samurai were

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,190
warriors, fighting men.

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,500
They served a daimyo, one of the great Japanese
lords.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,039
They lived in his castle, fought for him,
and died for him.

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,129
They fought with long swords and short swords,
spears, and bows and arrows.

6
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:44,470
They were brave, fierce men, famous for their
loyalty to their lord.

7
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:51,210
CHAPTER ONE
The Death of Asano

8
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,159
'Good morning, Lord Asano.'

9
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:00,170
The speaker was Lord Kira Yoshinaka, a tall
man, in black.

10
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,170
He stood in the middle of a room in the Shogun's
palace.

11
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,409
He watched Lord Asano, and waited.

12
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:16,270
Lord Asano Naganori was a younger man, thirty-four
years to Lord Kira's sixty years.

13
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,590
He walked slowly across the room from the
door, and stopped in front of Kira.

14
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,469
'Lord Kira,' he said coldly.

15
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:27,210
'Good morning.'

16
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,130
And then he bowed, just a small bow of the
head.

17
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,049
Lord Kira bowed too, an even smaller bow.

18
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,930
He smiled, but his eyes were cold.

19
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,869
'Are you ready for your next lesson, Lord
Asano?' he said.

20
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:53,439
'You have much to learn about palace ceremony,
and you are a very slow student.

21
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,750
Shall we begin?'

22
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,610
Lord Asano bowed again, but did not speak.

23
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,869
His mouth was a thin, hard line.

24
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:15,569
Every day Kira called him 'slow', or 'stupid',
or 'difficult', and he did not like it.

25
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:22,930
In the Shogun's palace at Edo in the year
1701, ceremony was very important.

26
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,350
The right words, at the right time of day.

27
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,459
The right bow, small or deep, for different
people.

28
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,340
The right clothes, at different hours of the
day.

29
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,250
The right presents, for the right people...

30
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:45,459
This was the way of life in the Shogun's palace,
and Lord Kira was the teacher of ceremony

31
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:51,430
- for this Shogun, and for many Shoguns before
him.

32
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:58,319
After forty years as a teacher, Kira knew
everything about the ceremony of the palace.

33
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,600
But Lord Asano knew nothing.

34
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,579
He was a daimyo from the country, from Ako
Castle, a place seventeen days' journey by

35
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:11,269
horse to the south-west of Edo.

36
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:20,560
The daimyo were powerful men in Japan at this
time, and were rulers in their own part of

37
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
the country.

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,140
But daimyo must also serve the Shogun, and
every year the Shogun called two of them to

39
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,190
his palace at Edo.

40
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:36,590
'Every day is the same,' said Asano angrily,
at his house in Edo that evening.

41
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:47,780
'Every day I must do this ceremony, or that
ceremony, I must stand here, or there, bow

42
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,340
to this person, or that person.

43
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,200
And I must do six months of this!

44
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,400
Every day Kira calls me bad names!

45
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,299
I make mistakes because he is a bad teacher!'

46
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:10,390
Hayami, one of Asano's samurai, helped him
with his ceremonial clothes.

47
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:16,350
Hayami was very good with the bow and arrow,
but not so good with words.

48
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,350
'Lord, I heard something about Kira,' he said.

49
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,910
'What?' said Asano.

50
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,150
'He likes presents, and money.

51
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:33,450
The other daimyo gives him presents or money,
and then Kira is happy, and the lessons go

52
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,860
well.

53
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,630
Why don't you give him a present?'

54
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,630
'No!'

55
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,740
shouted Asano.

56
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:47,510
'I am Lord Asano of Ako, and I do not give
presents to the Shogun's servants!

57
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:53,980
His job is to teach me ceremony, not to ask
for presents!'

58
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,730
Hayami said nothing more, but he was afraid
for his master.

59
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:05,710
Every day Asano came back from the palace
with an angry face, and angry words.

60
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,610
'How is this going to end?'

61
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,970
Hayami said to Kataoka, another of Asano's
samurai.

62
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,950
'Four more months of this.

63
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,630
What can I do?

64
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,350
We need Oishi here.

65
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:26,320
Lord Asano doesn't listen to me, but he listens
to Oishi sometimes.'

66
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,720
But Oishi Yoshio was at Ako Castle, a long
way away.

67
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,800
He was the captain of Lord Asano's three hundred
samurai.

68
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,910
When Lord Asano came to Edo, most of his samurai
came with him, but Oishi stayed behind at

69
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,370
Ako to take care of everything there.

70
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,370
***

71
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,880
It ended suddenly on a spring day in 1701.

72
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,820
The day began well, with a blue sky and the
song of birds in the palace gardens.

73
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,910
Lord Asano arrived at the palace, put on his
ceremonial clothes, and went for his lesson

74
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,110
with Lord Kira.

75
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,480
Perhaps Kira was tired that day.

76
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,760
Perhaps he was angry because there were no
presents from Lord Asano.

77
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,930
Perhaps he just did not like the young lord
from Ako.

78
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,510
'You must wait,' he told Asano.

79
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,030
'I have another, more important meeting first.'

80
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,290
He turned his back on Lord Asano.

81
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,040
'What a stupid man!'

82
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,920
Kira said.

83
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:46,460
Usually, he said things like this in a quiet
voice, but today he did not speak quietly,

84
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,030
and everybody in the great palace room could
hear him.

85
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:59,550
'I hear Asano's wife is stupid too, and his
children,' Lord Kira said to the room.

86
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,770
Something broke inside Lord Asano.

87
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,920
'Lord Kira, stop a moment,' he cried.

88
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,910
'Well, what is it?' said Kira, turning back
to Asano.

89
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,110
People remembered this moment for many years.

90
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,410
Asano drew his sword, and attacked Lord Kira.

91
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:30,000
With a cry, Kira put his hand to his head,
but he did not fall.

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,880
Asano lifted his sword again, but now there
were palace guards around him.

93
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,240
They: pulled him to the floor, and held his
sword arm.

94
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,650
Lord Kira ran away.

95
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,550
There was a deep cut on his face.

96
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,710
The Shogun's palace was a place of ceremony,
not a place for fighting.

97
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:58,250
It was a terrible thing to do - to draw a
sword and attack someone inside the palace.

98
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,390
The attack happened at about midday.

99
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:06,650
At one o'clock the guards took Asano to the
house of another daimyo.

100
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,280
At four o'clock an order came from the Shogun.

101
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:18,930
'Lord Asano must die, but because he is a
daimyo, he can die the samurai way, with honour.

102
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,590
He can commit seppuku.'

103
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,370
And so it happened.

104
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,930
At six o'clock that same day Lord Asano of
Ako committed seppuku.

105
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:38,270
He took out his long knife, and cut into his
stomach from left to right.

106
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:44,069
Outside the palace Lord Asano's samurai, Kataoka,
knew nothing of this.

107
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:51,500
He waited for his master to leave the palace
at the end of the day, but Asano never came.

108
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:57,529
At last another daimyo told Kataoka the terrible
news.

109
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:04,060
Kataoka ran back to Asano's house in Edo,
and called for Hayami and the other samurai.

110
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,950
'Our lord is dead,' he cried.

111
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,220
'Get the horses ready!

112
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:16,320
We must ride to Ako at once!'

113
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,450
CHAPTER TWO
The Plan

114
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:31,389
At that time, it was usually a journey of
seventeen days from Edo to Ako, but Kataoka

115
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:35,290
and Hayami did the journey in ten days.

116
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:43,279
When they arrived at Ako Castle, they were
tired, dirty, hungry, and thirsty.

117
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,029
Oishi Yoshio, the captain of the Ako samurai,
was not pleased with them.

118
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:50,230
'Look at you!' he said.

119
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,949
'What kind of samurai are you?

120
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:56,500
Dirty clothes, dirty horses...'

121
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:03,139
But Oishi forgot about that when he heard
the terrible news of Lord Asano's death.

122
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,990
'And that's not all,' said Hayami.

123
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,050
He pushed the hair out of his eyes.

124
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:16,640
'The Shogun's government is going to take
Lord Asano's castle, his land, his money - everything!

125
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,209
Can they do that, Oishi?'

126
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:21,170
'Yes,' said Oishi.

127
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,950
'They can.

128
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,279
To draw a sword in the Shogun's palace is
a crime.

129
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,449
But why did Lord Asano attack Kira?

130
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:31,990
What happened?

131
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,240
Did they fight?'

132
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,310
'We don't know,' said Kataoka, 'we weren't
there!

133
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,949
But Lord Asano was angry every day because
of Lord Kira.'

134
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:47,870
'But Asano didn't kill Kira?' said Oishi.

135
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,170
'No,' said Hayami.

136
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,000
'Kira is alive and well.

137
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,680
People say that he just has a cut on his head.'

138
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,089
'And where is Lord Asano's body now?' asked
Oishi.

139
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:08,740
'They're taking it to the temple of Sengaku-ji,'
said Kataoka, 'just outside Edo.

140
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,819
Some of our samurai went with the body.

141
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:15,019
Then they are coming back to Ako.'

142
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,019
***

143
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:22,089
During the next days, Lord Asano's samurai
made the journey down to Ako.

144
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:24,470
Some of them brought news.

145
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:33,939
'Lord Asano's younger brother, Daigaku, is
under house arrest in Edo,' Yoshida told Oishi.

146
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:36,980
Yoshida was one of the older samurai.

147
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,339
He and Oishi were old friends.

148
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:41,899
'Did you see Daigaku?'

149
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:43,860
asked Oishi.

150
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,660
'Yes, just for two minutes.

151
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:53,730
They're going to send him away, to Hiroshima,
to the Asano family there.'

152
00:11:53,730 --> 00:12:00,499
Soon there were nearly three hundred of Asano's
samurai at Ako, and Oishi Yoshio called a

153
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:01,829
meeting.

154
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:05,529
It was a noisy, angry meeting.

155
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:09,129
Horibe was a famous swordsman.

156
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:14,949
He was a fierce fighter, and a brave man,
but he did not often stop to think before

157
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:16,470
he spoke.

158
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,949
He was the first to speak.

159
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:24,430
'Lord Asano is dead because of Kira,' he shouted
to the meeting.

160
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,399
'Kira is a killer.

161
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,639
A man cannot live under the same sky as the
killer of his lord.

162
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,740
This is the code of the samurai!

163
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,910
When do we attack Kira?'

164
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:44,579
The samurai began to talk, but Oishi held
up his hand.

165
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:48,660
'Nobody questions your honour as a samurai,
Horibe.

166
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,839
But we are not samurai now, we are ronin.

167
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,499
We have no master, no lord.

168
00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:04,160
The Shogun's government killed Lord Asano
because of a crime - the crime of drawing

169
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,999
a sword in the palace.

170
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,199
And why did this crime happen?

171
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,620
Because of Lord Kira.

172
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:19,139
We want revenge for our lord's death, and
that means Kira must die.

173
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,410
But he knows that, and he has many friends
in the government.

174
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,350
So we must be careful, we must be clever.'

175
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,279
'Careful?

176
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,220
Clever?'

177
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,240
shouted Horibe.

178
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,410
'What kind of samurai are you?

179
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,439
We must attack Lord Kira at once!

180
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:43,760
In Edo, people in the streets are saying that.

181
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,399
They know we must take revenge for Asano's
death.

182
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,709
People want us to do that!

183
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:53,660
It is the samurai way!'

184
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,610
'So you want to die a dog's death outside
the palace?'

185
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,610
called Yoshida.

186
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,810
'How many guards are there at the palace?

187
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,889
Eh?

188
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:05,730
Tell me that!

189
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,139
Hundreds!

190
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:14,640
We can't get near Kira - he knows we want
him, so he has hundreds of guards around him,

191
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,589
day and night.'

192
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:23,649
'The government is going to take Ako Castle
away from the Asano family,' called another

193
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:24,649
samurai.

194
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:29,800
'When the government soldiers come here, can
we fight them?

195
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,680
Can we hold Ako Castle for Daigaku?

196
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,550
He's the head of the Asano family now.'

197
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,180
Kataoka answered this question.

198
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,610
'For a week, perhaps.

199
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,269
But not longer.

200
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:49,369
No, the Asano family at Ako is finished.

201
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:56,339
We must leave Ako Castle and begin new lives
as ronin.'

202
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,519
'So what can we do?'

203
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,529
called Okuda, one of Horibe's friends.

204
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:04,930
'Tell us, Oishi!

205
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,290
What can we do?'

206
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,720
'What do you want?' said Oishi.

207
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,470
'Do you want revenge?

208
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,819
Revenge has a price, and the price is death.

209
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:24,230
We cannot hope to live after we take our revenge
on Kira.

210
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,249
We must commit seppuku - everyone of us.'

211
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:30,959
'We are samurai!'

212
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,230
cried a man called Hara.

213
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,970
'Death with honour is always better than a
life without honour.

214
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,910
That is the samurai code!'

215
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,369
Oishi smiled.

216
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:48,709
'There are brave hearts in this room.

217
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:52,350
Now go away, and think.

218
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,339
Think about the samurai way.

219
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:57,999
Where is the road to honour?

220
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:03,380
Can you live under the same sky as the killer
of your daimyo?

221
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,059
Think long and carefully.

222
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:10,800
Talk to your families, and come back here
in three days.

223
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,699
Or leave Ako and begin a new life.'

224
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:20,860
In the next two days many ronin left the castle.

225
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:27,449
They took their families and went away, perhaps
to serve a new daimyo, perhaps to work in

226
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:31,700
the cities, perhaps to go hungry.

227
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,829
The life of a ronin was not easy.

228
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,639
After three days Oishi called the next meeting.

229
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,600
He and Yoshida stood at the door and watched.

230
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,930
Horibe, Okuda, and their friends arrived first,
of course.

231
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:58,970
Then more came, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty...
sixty-two.

232
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,620
Yoshida closed the doors, and Oishi began
to speak.

233
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:10,360
'You are here because you want revenge for
the death of our daimyo.

234
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:17,440
You are true samurai, loyal to your lord in
life - and in death.

235
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,620
We must make a league together - a league
for revenge.

236
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:31,160
But for now, we must be silent, we must be
secret, we must wait for months, maybe years,

237
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,220
before we can move.

238
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:40,080
We cannot attack Kira now, because he and
his guards are waiting for us.

239
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,270
But when he forgets about us, then we can
move.

240
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,950
Because we, the ronin - we do not forget.

241
00:17:51,950 --> 00:18:02,400
We can wait a long, long time for revenge.'

242
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:10,760
CHAPTER THREE
The Long Wait

243
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,650
And so it was.

244
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:19,270
The soldiers of the Shogun's government came
to Ako, took the castle and the land.

245
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:25,260
And then the sixty-two ronin left Ako to go
their different ways.

246
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:31,430
Oishi talked to every ronin in the league
before they left Ako, and every man had a

247
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,490
plan.

248
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,360
Some of the ronin went to Edo.

249
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,870
There, they found jobs as workmen, guards,
or gardeners.

250
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,960
Other ronin went to live in Osaka or other
cities.

251
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,080
'Live very quietly,' Oishi told them.

252
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:55,920
'Don't talk about revenge, don't talk about
anything to anybody.

253
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,060
Meet secretly, and be careful of spies.

254
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:07,670
Kira's men are going to be everywhere, watching
and listening, all the time.'

255
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:13,580
Oishi took his family, his wife and three
children, to live near Kyoto.

256
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,810
Three of the ronin went with him - Kataoka,
Mimura, and Hara.

257
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:25,210
Kataoka and Mimura lived in Oishi's house,
and Hara found a job.

258
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,940
'What kind of job?' said Oishi.

259
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,970
Hara laughed.

260
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,560
'I'm teaching boys how to shoot with bow and
arrows,' he said.

261
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,250
'That's not a job for a samurai!' said Kataoka.

262
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:44,230
'But we're not samurai now, we're ronin, remember?'
said Hara.

263
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,450
'And a ronin needs rice to eat.'

264
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,870
***

265
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,090
Weeks went past, and weeks turned into months.

266
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:02,180
Oishi began to live a very different life
now from his old life as captain of the Asano

267
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,290
samurai.

268
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:08,760
Every day he went into the town, to the old
houses down by the river.

269
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,070
He made new friends, and spent his time with
bad people.

270
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,860
Often, he was out all night.

271
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,180
Kataoka and Mimura watched this, and they
were not happy about it.

272
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,190
'Why does he go to these places?' said Mimura.

273
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,300
'Why don't you ask him?'

274
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,710
Kataoka said.

275
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,090
'Not me!'

276
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,090
Mimura said.

277
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,490
'He gets angry when you ask questions.

278
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,860
He gets angry at bad news too.

279
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,660
You remember when the news came about the
seven ronin?'

280
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:50,460
Seven of the ronin from Ako did not want to
be in the league against Kira any longer.

281
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,030
The numbers were now down to fifty-five.

282
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:00,260
One day more news arrived - from one of the
ronin in Edo.

283
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:05,550
This man, Isogai, worked in the Shogun's palace
gardens.

284
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:12,960
He could watch government workers when they
came and went, and sometimes he heard things.

285
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,590
He sent this message to Oishi.

286
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,910
Lord Kira does not work in the palace now.

287
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,210
His job is finished.

288
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,930
People say that the Shogun is not pleased
with him.

289
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:32,230
Kira is living in his daimyo house, a big
mansion near the Sumida river.

290
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,990
Horibe says, can we attack him now?

291
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,160
Oishi suddenly came alive again.

292
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,190
'No, no, no!

293
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,940
Not yet!' he said.

294
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,790
'I must go to Edo and talk to them.

295
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,110
Kataoka, come with me.

296
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,550
Mimura - stay here with my family.'

297
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:58,380
In Edo, Oishi met secretly with some of the
ronin in the league.

298
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,530
'Listen,' he said.

299
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:07,510
'Kira's wife is from the Uesugi family, and
they are very rich and powerful.

300
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:13,620
There are many Uesugi guards around Kira's
mansion, because he is still afraid of us.

301
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,390
We can never get past all those guards with
just fifty-five men.

302
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,780
We must wait.'

303
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,240
'But how long?' said Horibe.

304
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,360
'Kira is an old man, and he could die any
day!

305
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,980
Where is our revenge then?'

306
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,140
'Begin planning,' said Oishi.

307
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,780
'Everybody has swords, but we need armour,
spears, and bows and arrows.

308
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,740
You can begin to find them, but secretly.

309
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,310
And hide them well!'

310
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:56,410
Oishi and Kataoka went back to Kyoto, and
again, Oishi spent his nights in the town

311
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,750
with all kinds of bad men.

312
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:05,040
People began saying that Oishi was a samurai
without honour.

313
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,240
Hara came to visit one day, and was angry.

314
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,380
'This is not good!' he said fiercely to Oishi.

315
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,470
'Where is your honour as a samurai?'

316
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,410
'Get out!'

317
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,410
shouted Oishi.

318
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,120
'Get out of my house!'

319
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,320
Kataoka walked with Hara down the street.

320
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,140
'What's happening to him?' said Hara.

321
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,120
'Why is he doing this?'

322
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,520
'It's all right,' said Kataoka.

323
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,230
'Just go home, and wait.'

324
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,820
It was not a happy house.

325
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:46,390
When he was there, Oishi shouted at everyone
- his wife, his children, Kataoka, Mimura,

326
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,590
the house servants.

327
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:55,890
Mimura often went out walking in the town,
to get away from the house and all the shouting.

328
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:03,520
One dark night he saw the cook from Oishi's
house at a street corner, talking to two men.

329
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,820
When they saw him, they stopped talking, and
the cook walked quickly away.

330
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:15,830
Mimura crossed the street to look at the two
men, but they turned away and went into a

331
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,830
house.

332
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:23,450
And in the light from the house doorway, Mimura
saw something very interesting...

333
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,300
He ran home at once with his news.

334
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,850
'Oishi, I think your cook is a spy for Kira!

335
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,990
Those men had on their coats the sign of the
Uesugi family.

336
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:41,410
It was very small, but I saw it clearly in
the light!'

337
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,510
'Ha!'

338
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,610
cried Kataoka.

339
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,670
'What shall we do with this spying cook, Oishi?

340
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,410
Kill him?'

341
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,850
Oishi smiled.

342
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,160
'Nothing,' he said.

343
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,310
'Nothing?' said Kataoka.

344
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,530
'We can't do "nothing"!'

345
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:02,200
'Oh yes, we can,' said Oishi.

346
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,720
'This is very good.

347
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,170
We want this spy to send news back to Kira
- the right kind of news.

348
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:17,850
We know the cook is a spy, but the cook doesn't
know that we know.

349
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,720
So this is good for us.

350
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,230
He can tell Kira that I am now a samurai without
honour.

351
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,760
And who is afraid of a samurai without honour?'

352
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,330
'Aaah!' said Mimura.

353
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,110
'I think I begin to understand.'

354
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,470
'Good,' said Oishi.

355
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,710
'At last.'

356
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,740
Kataoka laughed.

357
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:50,460
'So,' Oishi said, 'when you talk in the house,
be careful.

358
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,530
Remember who is listening.'

359
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,570
Suddenly, he began to shout at them.

360
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,570
'Get out!

361
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:02,620
I'm going out into town, and nobody is going
to stop me!'

362
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:10,810
Kataoka and Mimura left the room, smiling.

363
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,810
***

364
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,810
Time passed.

365
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,590
Spring 1702 came, and then summer.

366
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:22,150
The death of Lord Asano of Ako was now more
than a year ago.

367
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:27,720
In the streets of Edo, there was no talk of
revenge by the Asano samurai.

368
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,160
They were just ronin, living here and there
in different cities in Japan.

369
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:41,270
Their captain, Oishi Yoshio, was without honour,
and spent his time with bad men.

370
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:49,211
Kira began to feel safer, and the Uesugi guards
around his home went back to the Uesugi mansion

371
00:26:49,211 --> 00:26:52,250
across the river.

372
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:57,930
At the end of the summer Oishi came home late
one night after an evening down by the river

373
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,830
in Kyoto.

374
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,010
When he came into the house, he shouted noisily.

375
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,010
'Riku!

376
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,010
Riku!

377
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,810
Where are you?

378
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,220
Come here!'

379
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:16,100
Riku, his wife of twenty years, came quietly
into the room, and Oishi began to shout at

380
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
her.

381
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,430
'I'm tired of you - I don't want to see your
face again.

382
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,370
Go away!

383
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,930
Leave my house!

384
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:29,630
Go back to your father's house - our marriage
is ended.

385
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:34,060
I can find more beautiful girls in the town.

386
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,620
Go!'

387
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:41,910
Riku put her face in her hands and began to
cry, very quietly.

388
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,710
From the other side of the room, Oishi shouted
some more.

389
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,110
Riku did not move.

390
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:54,660
Then she said, very quietly, 'Must I go?'

391
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,340
Oishi came and stood in front of her.

392
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,240
He put his mouth close to her ear, and spoke
in a whisper.

393
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,780
'The time is coming.

394
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,580
I don't want you here in this house when it
happens.

395
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,860
You know why.

396
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,900
So I must send you away, back to your father.

397
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:25,080
The government cannot do anything to you when
you live in your father's house.

398
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,680
That is best for you, and the children.'

399
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,490
Riku looked into his face.

400
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,330
'Yes, I understand.

401
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,160
Do you want me to take all the children with
me?'

402
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,530
They still spoke in whispers, because in that
house the walls had ears.

403
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:49,740
'The younger children, yes,' said Oishi.

404
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,230
'But Chikara is fifteen, nearly sixteen now,
and a man.

405
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,580
He is ready to be a samurai.

406
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,790
He can go with you, or he can stay with me.

407
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,810
Ask him.

408
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:08,620
Tell him to come and see me in the morning.'

409
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:14,230
Riku looked into his face one more time, then
turned to go.

410
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:20,530
Oishi put out his hand, and touched her face,
just for a second.

411
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:24,820
Then he, too, turned away.

412
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,960
That night he did not sleep.

413
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,800
He sat for a long time in the dark, looking
out at the stars in the night sky.

414
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,040
In the early morning his son Chikara found
him there.

415
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,380
'Father, I want to stay here with you.

416
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,930
I want to be a samurai, and I am ready.

417
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:48,220
I am a good swordsman now.'

418
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,650
Oishi put his hand on his son's shoulder.

419
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,980
'Good man,' he said.

420
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,590
'The league needs strong swordsmen like you.'

421
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,900
He was silent for a minute.

422
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,880
'Did you say goodbye to your mother?' he asked.

423
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,750
'Yes,' Chikara said.

424
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,960
'She left an hour ago.

425
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
She...'

426
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,930
He did not finish.

427
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,930
'Yes.

428
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:16,550
I know,' said Oishi.

429
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,330
'But this is the life of a samurai.

430
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:26,810
Come - we have work to do.'

431
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,000
CHAPTER FOUR
The Attack

432
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,630
Autumn came.

433
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:42,070
The leaves turned yellow and gold, and fell
from the trees.

434
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:48,210
Oishi sent messages to the ronin, and one
by one they began to arrive in Edo.

435
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:54,930
They travelled at different times, and went
to different 'safe houses' in the city.

436
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:59,120
Oishi made the journey in November 1702.

437
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,760
When he arrived in Edo, he called a meeting
in a room above a noisy restaurant.

438
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,730
'Now you must decide, for the last time,'
he told his men.

439
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:16,250
'Do you want revenge for Lord Asano, or not?

440
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:21,630
Some of you, I know, have young children,
or very old parents.

441
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,610
Do those men want to leave the league?

442
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,910
You can go with honour.'

443
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,160
Eight men left.

444
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,600
There were now forty-seven ronin in the league.

445
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:42,740
There were young men and old men - the youngest
was Chikara, now aged sixteen, and the oldest

446
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,940
was seventy-six.

447
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:51,890
There were brothers, and some fathers and
sons, like Oishi and Chikara.

448
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:57,020
In the weeks before the attack, many of the
ronin wrote letters home to their wives and

449
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,230
families - to say their last goodbyes.

450
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,950
They began to get ready.

451
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:11,230
One ronin had a ground plan of Kira's mansion,
and Oishi studied this very carefully.

452
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:19,550
There were high walls around the house - 132
metres on the long side and 61 metres on the

453
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,710
short side.

454
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:27,780
There were two gates, one in the east wall
and one in the west wall.

455
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:33,700
Inside the walls, there was a long building,
with courtyards and gardens all around it.

456
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:39,060
'We need to go in at both gates at the same
time,' said Oishi.

457
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:46,020
'We must have two groups of men, one to attack
the front gate and one to attack the back

458
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,020
gate.'

459
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,280
'Yes,' Yoshida said.

460
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,050
'And we must stop any servant from leaving
the mansion.

461
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:57,330
We don't want them to run across the river
to the Uesugi and call for help.'

462
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,550
There were high walls around the mansion.

463
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:03,060
'How many people are living in Kira's mansion?'
asked Hayami.

464
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,310
'And how many of them are samurai?'

465
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:11,750
'There are more than a hundred and twenty
people inside those walls,' said Okuda.

466
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,570
'Perhaps about fifty of them are guards...

467
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,350
We don't know how many samurai.'

468
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:22,040
'What about our weapons?' asked Oishi, looking
at Horibe.

469
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,370
'The weapons are ready,' Horibe said.

470
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,220
'Everybody has their swords.

471
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,440
We have spears for everybody too, and many
bows and arrows.

472
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,390
And we have armour.'

473
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,850
'Good,' said Oishi.

474
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:45,980
'So now we wait for the right time, when Kira
is at home.'

475
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
***

476
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:54,920
The right time came on December 14, 1702,
a dark night with snow falling from the sky.

477
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,280
The people of Edo slept quietly, warm in their
houses, but the ronin put on their armour,

478
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,170
took their weapons, and waited for midnight.

479
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:09,609
Before they left, Oishi spoke to his men.

480
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:18,519
'At last we can finish our work for Lord Asano,
and take revenge for his death, now nearly

481
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:20,460
two years ago.

482
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,029
We are here to kill Lord Kira Yoshinaka.

483
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:31,639
We must fight his guards and his samurai,
yes, and kill them, but do not kill women

484
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,099
and children.

485
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:35,950
We are not here to do that.

486
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,569
And remember, you all have a whistle.

487
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:44,659
When you find Lord Kira, blow your whistle.'

488
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:51,599
Then the forty-seven ronin went silently through
the snow to Lord Kira's mansion.

489
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:58,829
Oishi and Hara took their group to the front
gate, and Yoshida with Oishi's son Chikara

490
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:04,200
took their group of men to the back gate.

491
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,410
Outside the mansion they put signs in the
streets:

492
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:15,140
WE, THE RONIN FROM AKO CASTLE, ARE TAKING
OUR REVENGE ON KIRA YOSHINAKA TONIGHT, FOR

493
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:19,430
THE DEATH OF OUR DAIMYO, LORD ASANO NAGANORI.

494
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:24,769
WE ARE NOT NIGHT THIEVES AND DO NOT PLAN TO
ATTACK OTHER PEOPLE.

495
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:28,089
YOU ARE SAFE IN YOUR HOUSES.

496
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:34,640
Later, when the neighbours came out into the
streets, they saw the signs, and went back

497
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,559
into their houses.

498
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:42,859
They did not like Lord Kira, and so did nothing
to help him.

499
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:49,400
At the front gate, four men climbed over the
wall, and went silently into the guardroom.

500
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,849
They fought the guards and tied them up.

501
00:35:52,849 --> 00:36:00,160
Then they broke down the gate from the inside,
and Oishi and his men came into the courtyard.

502
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:06,320
At the same time, at the back gate, Yoshida
and Chikara and their men climbed over the

503
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,809
wall into the back courtyard.

504
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:14,260
They tied up the guards there; then waited
quietly in the snow.

505
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:22,060
Before the attack began, Oishi sent four men
up onto the walls with bows and arrows.

506
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,680
The great mansion was still dark and silent,
and Oishi whispered his orders.

507
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:34,250
'Lord Kira's servants are going to try and
run away to get help,' he said.

508
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,970
'Watch carefully, and shoot them down at once.

509
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,299
Nobody must leave!'

510
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:47,260
Now everything was ready, and Oishi beat his
drum loudly.

511
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:53,579
The sound of the drum told the men at both
gates to start the attack at the same moment.

512
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:58,730
The ronin ran through the courtyards and gardens,
and broke into the house at the front and

513
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,930
the back.

514
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:07,829
By now, everybody in the mansion was awake,
and Lord Kira's men, still in their nightclothes,

515
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:11,420
came running with swords and spears and knives.

516
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:18,480
Suddenly, the night was full of noise - men
shouting, the sound of sword against sword,

517
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,010
the cries of women and children...

518
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:27,380
In the great front room of the mansion, the
fighting was very fierce.

519
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:34,150
Three of Kira's samurai, all famous swordsmen,
fought for a long time, and Oishi's men could

520
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,849
not get past them into the rooms behind.

521
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:46,859
But the ronin fought hard too, and in the
end Hara and two other ronin killed the three

522
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:48,390
samurai.

523
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:53,539
Then Oishi's men moved on into the next rooms.

524
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:58,630
At the other end of the long mansion, the
fighting was also fierce.

525
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:04,730
One of Kira's samurai attacked Yoshida, and
jumped in under Yoshida's sword arm with his

526
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,210
knife.

527
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:13,010
Yoshida fell back, but Horibe was right behind
the samurai, and cut him down with his long

528
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,319
sword.

529
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:19,150
Then the two ronin moved on into the next
room.

530
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,019
Soon there was fighting in every room.

531
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:28,029
Lord Kira's men fought bravely, but the ronin
were fierce and deadly.

532
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:35,930
Many men died, and some were hurt, but not
one of the ronin died that night.

533
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:42,339
In every room Oishi and his men looked for
Lord Kira, but he was never there.

534
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:47,509
At last the two groups of ronin met in the
middle of the mansion, and the fighting came

535
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:50,410
to a stop.

536
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:56,240
Seventeen of Kira's guards and samurai were
dead, and the others ran away.

537
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,470
Women and children sat in the corners of rooms,
crying.

538
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:05,000
Oishi called out to Yoshida, 'Kira?

539
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,220
Where is he?'

540
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,579
'I don't know,' called Yoshida.

541
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:13,480
'He wasn't in the rooms at the back of the
house when we came through.'

542
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,380
'What about the family living rooms?'

543
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,380
called Horibe.

544
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,300
'Let's look in there again.'

545
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,359
'We can't lose Kira now!'

546
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:23,630
shouted Okuda.

547
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,730
'Come on!'

548
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,039
The ronin began to feel afraid.

549
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,849
Where was Lord Kira?

550
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:33,630
Was he still in the mansion somewhere?

551
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,940
Or did he escape when the fighting began?

552
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,160
They ran through the family rooms, looking
everywhere.

553
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,740
In Kira's sleeping-room Oishi put his hand
on the bed-clothes.

554
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,249
'They're warm!' he shouted.

555
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:53,279
'The bed-clothes are still warm - he was here
not long ago!

556
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:58,970
Find him!'

557
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:07,549
CHAPTER FIVE
The Revenge

558
00:40:07,549 --> 00:40:13,989
Oishi sent his men, in four groups, to look
everywhere - in the house, the kitchens, the

559
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:19,950
gardens, the courtyards, the guardrooms, under
the floors...

560
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:25,670
In the courtyard by the north wall, three
of the ronin found a wood store.

561
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:33,140
One of them, Hazama, went inside, and pushed
his spear deep into the wood.

562
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,589
There was a sudden cry, from under the wood.

563
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:43,940
Immediately, the three ronin began to pull
the wood out, and very quickly they found

564
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:48,170
an old man, dressed in white nightclothes.

565
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:54,220
'Old man, what is your name?' said Hazama.

566
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,210
The old man said nothing.

567
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,170
He sat on the snowy ground, with his hands
over his face.

568
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,290
'It's him,' said one of the ronin.

569
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:06,569
'Quick - blow your whistle.'

570
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:13,269
When they heard the whistle, all the ronin
came running, with Oishi at the front.

571
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:17,609
Oishi carried a light, and held it near the
old man's face.

572
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:22,349
'Yes, it's Kira,' he said to his men.

573
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:26,940
'See - here, on his head, that old cut.

574
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,059
It was a cut made by a sword...

575
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:32,869
Lord Asano's sword.

576
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:35,910
It's in the right place.'

577
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:40,349
Oishi stood up, and bowed deeply to the old
man.

578
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:47,849
'Lord Kira Yoshinaka, we are the samurai of
Asano Naganori.

579
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:56,920
We are loyal men, loyal to our master, and
so we are here tonight to take revenge for

580
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,170
his death.

581
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:08,829
Lord Asano committed seppuku, and so we ask
you, Lord Kira, to commit seppuku too - to

582
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:13,930
die bravely, with honour.'

583
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:19,020
On the ground in front of Kira, Oishi carefully
placed a long knife.

584
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:23,700
'Here, Lord Kira, is a knife.

585
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,599
Lord Asano's knife.'

586
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:29,460
But the old man did nothing.

587
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:35,210
He sat on the ground, shaking from head to
toe, not speaking.

588
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:40,099
Again and again, Oishi asked him to commit
seppuku.

589
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:44,410
Again and again, he showed him Lord Asano's
knife.

590
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:50,099
But Lord Kira did not move or put out his
hand to take the knife.

591
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:55,769
He did not want to take the road to death
with honour.

592
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:59,819
At last, Oishi Yoshio stood up.

593
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:09,289
He bowed again to Lord Kira; then he drew
his sword and cut off Lord Kira's head.

594
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:14,180
The ronin put a coat around the head and tied
it to a spear.

595
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:20,420
It was three o'clock in the morning, and their
long wait for revenge was finished.

596
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:28,640
'And now,' said Oishi, 'we must leave at once
and take the head to Lord Asano's grave at

597
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,759
Sengaku-ji.

598
00:43:30,759 --> 00:43:37,940
We must do this last thing for Lord Asano,
and then we are ready for death.

599
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:44,269
'But before we leave,' he said, 'we must put
out the house fires.

600
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:48,180
We don't want to start a fire in the city.'

601
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:53,569
The house was full of dead bodies and crying
women, and there was no one to take care of

602
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:54,640
things.

603
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:01,769
Edo was a city of buildings made of wood,
and fire was a terrible danger.

604
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:07,619
They put out the fires, and forty-six ronin
left the mansion.

605
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:15,599
The forty-seventh ronin, a young man called
Terasaka, was now on his way to Hiroshima.

606
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:22,819
Oishi sent him there to take the news of the
attack to Daigaku, the brother of Lord Asano.

607
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:30,421
Two of the ronin carried the spear with Lord
Kira's head, and Oishi walked in front, with

608
00:44:30,421 --> 00:44:36,170
Yoshida on one side and Chikara on the other
side.

609
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:40,160
They began their long walk to Sengaku-ji.

610
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:49,930
And in the streets of Edo, people came out
of their houses to watch.

611
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:58,269
CHAPTER SIX
The Punishment

612
00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:04,710
The Asano family graves were next to the temple
at Sengaku-ji, and it was a ten-kilometre

613
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,270
walk there from Kira's mansion.

614
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:14,730
The ronin were afraid of attack from the Uesugi
guards, so they kept away from Edo Palace

615
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:21,759
and walked on the eastern side of the Sumida
River until the Eitai bridge.

616
00:45:21,759 --> 00:45:24,240
Then they crossed the river.

617
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,480
Oishi sent two of the ronin to Edo Palace,
to take the news of the ronins' revenge to

618
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,440
the government.

619
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:40,250
In the first light of day more and more people
came out into the streets - talking and whispering

620
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:46,369
about the killing of Lord Kira and the revenge
of the forty-seven ronin.

621
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:50,869
The news ran like fire through the city.

622
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:52,970
And the people liked the news.

623
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,900
'What brave men!'

624
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,920
they said.

625
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,530
'What loyal samurai!

626
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:02,779
These ronin waited nearly two years to take
their revenge!

627
00:46:02,779 --> 00:46:05,550
That is the samurai code!

628
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:11,109
They are true samurai, like in the old days.'

629
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:18,099
The ronin passed Zojo-ji temple, and began
to climb the hill to Sengaku-ji.

630
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:23,600
When they arrived at the temple, they washed
Lord Kira's head in the well (you can see

631
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,119
the well to this day at Sengaku-ji).

632
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:35,660
Then, slowly and carefully, Oishi placed the
head in front of Lord Asano's grave.

633
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:44,730
The forty-six ronin kneeled before the grave,
and Oishi spoke these words: 'For many years,

634
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:51,790
Lord Asano, we served you, we ate your food,
we lived in your castle.

635
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:56,869
You tried to kill your enemy, but you lost
your life.

636
00:46:56,869 --> 00:47:01,500
We could not live under the same sky as your
enemy.

637
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:08,790
Last night we finished your work, and took
revenge for your death.

638
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:16,200
'Young and old, we, the ronin of Ako, are
your loyal servants.

639
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:23,009
We serve you, by sword and by spear, in life
and in death.'

640
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:24,009
***

641
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:31,890
For two days Kira's head lay on Lord Asano's
grave at Sengaku-ji.

642
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:37,549
Then the temple priests took it away and sent
it back to his family.

643
00:47:37,549 --> 00:47:43,990
The Shogun's officers arrested the forty-six
ronin and took them to the mansions of four

644
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,769
different daimyo.

645
00:47:45,769 --> 00:47:50,319
There, the ronin waited to hear their punishment.

646
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:57,829
Oishi, with sixteen of his men, went to the
Hosokawa mansion near Sengaku-ji.

647
00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:05,240
To honour them, 1,400 samurai walked with
them through the snowy streets, and the people

648
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,540
of the city watched.

649
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:13,880
Now came a difficult time for the Shogun and
the government.

650
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:20,319
Killing was a crime, and in those days the
punishment for that crime was to cut off the

651
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,720
head.

652
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,349
But a death like that was a death without
honour.

653
00:48:26,349 --> 00:48:34,349
Many people said this: 'The ronin are good
samurai - brave men, loyal to their master.

654
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:39,859
They were right to kill Kira and to take revenge
for their lord's death.

655
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:47,130
They followed the samurai code of honour,
so they must have a samurai death.'

656
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:54,609
But other people thought differently, and
said this: 'Lord Asano attacked Lord Kira

657
00:48:54,609 --> 00:48:59,380
in the palace, and Asano died because of this
crime.

658
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:05,380
Lord Kira did not kill him, so there was no
need for revenge.

659
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:11,460
This was not a revenge killing, and the ronin
are just killers.

660
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,880
So they must die a killer's death.'

661
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,640
The government could not agree on the punishment.

662
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:26,579
For weeks they talked and argued, asked this
person and that person, talked and argued

663
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:27,829
again.

664
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:32,430
The ronin waited quietly in the four daimyo
houses.

665
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:37,539
They waited for death, one way or another.

666
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:45,680
At last, one day in March 1703, many weeks
after the death of Kira, the order came from

667
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,950
the Shogun's palace.

668
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:56,210
The ronin must die, but because of their loyalty
to their lord, they could die the samurai

669
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,280
death.

670
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,710
They could commit seppuku and keep their honour
as samurai.

671
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:10,509
That same day, in the four daimyo mansions,
the ronin got ready for death.

672
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:17,880
One by one, in the courtyards of the mansions,
the forty-six ronin committed seppuku.

673
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:24,479
Their bodies were put in graves at Sengaku-ji
temple, close to their master, Lord Asano

674
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,779
Naganori.

675
00:50:26,779 --> 00:50:33,380
The forty-seventh ronin, Terasaka, arrived
back from Hiroshima after the death of the

676
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,839
other ronin.

677
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:41,170
He went at once to Edo Palace, and asked for
the same death as the other ronin.

678
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:46,510
But he was a young man, and the Shogun felt
sorry for him.

679
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,920
So Terasaka did not commit seppuku.

680
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:57,760
He lived to the great age of eighty-three,
but when he died, he wanted to be with the

681
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,509
other ronin.

682
00:50:59,509 --> 00:51:04,359
So his grave is the forty-seventh grave at
Sengaku-ji.

683
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:11,999
Sengaku-ji today
Three hundred years later, people in Japan

684
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:18,039
are still talking and arguing about the story
of the Forty-Seven Ronin.

685
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:26,000
Every year, on December 14, there is a festival
at the Sengaku-ji temple to remember Lord

686
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,590
Asano's death and the revenge of his brave,
loyal ronin.

687
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:35,410
Thousands of people come every year to this
festival.

688
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:39,390
The way of the samurai is not forgotten.

689
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,420
- THE END -
