00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,310
CHAPTER ONE
Food for Life

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,090
Everyone needs food to live.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,440
It gives you energy to work and play.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,100
It also gives you nutrients to grow well and
stay healthy.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,680
Do you eat a balanced diet with lots of different
nutrients?

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,119
Proteins

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,240
Your body needs proteins to build muscles.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,840
Proteins are also important for healthy hair
and fingernails.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:39,540
You can get lots of proteins from meat, fish,
and eggs Dairy products, like milk, cheese,

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,690
and yogurt, also contain proteins.

11
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:50,610
Many people don't eat animal products, but
they can get proteins from plant products.

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,660
Pulses, like beans and lentils, are rich in
proteins.

13
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,750
Many grains, nuts, and seeds have proteins,
too.

14
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,840
Which of these foods do you eat?

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,010
Carbohydrates

16
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,830
Carbohydrates give your body energy.

17
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:18,670
You can get carbohydrates from grain products
like rice, bread, and pasta.

18
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:25,430
Your body digests these foods slowly, so they
give you energy for many hours.

19
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:31,340
Some vegetables, like potatoes, also have
lots of carbohydrates.

20
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,520
What grains and vegetables do you eat?

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,690
Sugar is also a carbohydrate.

22
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:45,090
Your body digests sugar quickly, so it gives
you energy right away.

23
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,990
Don't eat too many sweet foods like candy
or ice cream, and remember that you can also

24
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,310
get sugar from naturally sweet foods.

25
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:02,740
Have a bowl of fruit with a little honey!

26
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,390
We also need to drink lots of water to stay
healthy.

27
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:13,950
Did you know that about 70 percents of your
body is water?

28
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,390
Fats

29
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,420
You need to eat some fats to grow well and
stay healthy.

30
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:27,170
Your body also stores fats for extra energy,
and to keep you warm in winter.

31
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,760
Some types of meat and fish have a lot of
fats.

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,820
Dairy products, like butter and cheese, have
fats, too.

33
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:43,990
You can also get fats from plant products
like nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils.

34
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:49,830
Be careful - too many fats can make you fat!

35
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,230
Vitamins

36
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,730
Your body needs vitamins to stay healthy and
fight diseases.

37
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,010
Vitamin A keeps your skin healthy.

38
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:07,430
You can get vitamin A from orange fruits and
vegetables like carrots or pumpkins.

39
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,550
Dark green vegetables, like spinach, have
lots of vitamin A, too.

40
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,230
Dairy products give you vitamin B for healthy
blood.

41
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:24,100
You can also get vitamin B from meat, fish,
and eggs.

42
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,280
Vitamin C helps your body fight diseases.

43
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:35,379
You can get vitamin C from citrus fruits like
oranges and lemons.

44
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,280
Minerals

45
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,510
Your body also needs minerals.

46
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,480
You need calcium for strong bones and healthy
teeth.

47
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,930
Dairy products, like milk and yogurt, are
good sources of calcium.

48
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,819
You also need iron for healthy blood.

49
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:03,239
You can get iron from red meat and eggs, or
from vegetables like broccoli and spinach.

50
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,349
Salt is also an important mineral, but be
careful!

51
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:13,040
Too much salty food is bad for you.

52
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,479
CHAPTER TWO
Food Producers

53
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,979
Do you know where rice comes from?

54
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:25,439
Where do we get our fruits and vegetables?

55
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:31,249
And who produces the milk that we drink or
the seafood that we eat?

56
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:33,559
Arable Farmers

57
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:37,749
Arable farmers grow crops that we can eat.

58
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:43,490
Some crops, like rice, wheat, and vegetables,
grow in fields.

59
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,740
Before farmers plant their crops, they plow
their fields.

60
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,539
Some farmers use animals, like horses or oxen,
to help.

61
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:58,219
Other farmers use modern machines.

62
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:02,860
Then farmers sow seeds or plant seedlings.

63
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:09,279
When the crops are ready, the farmers harvest
them and take them to markets.â€ƒ

64
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,030
Some fruits, like melons, are grown in fields.

65
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:22,349
Other fruits, like apples, cherries, or kiwi
fruits, are grown on trees in orchards.

66
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:28,490
Sometimes farmers harvest the fruits with
machines, but some fruits, like peaches, are

67
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,979
very delicate.

68
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,300
Farmers have to pick them by hand.

69
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,669
That's very hard work!

70
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:47,169
i fruit originally came , but it became popular
in New Zealand.

71
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:54,229
Farmers there named the fruit after New Zealand's
national bird - the kiwi!

72
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,409
Plants need water to grow and produce crops.

73
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:04,589
In some parts of the world it doesn't rain
much, so farmers use irrigation systems to

74
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:07,469
water their plants.

75
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:15,070
Rice plants need lots of water, so farmers
grow them in wet fields called paddy fields.

76
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:20,210
The paddy fields are often in flat areas near
rivers.

77
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:26,300
In some countries, like Vietnam, farmers build
terraces of paddy fields on the sides of hills

78
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,970
to grow as much rice as possible.

79
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,619
Livestock Farmers

80
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:39,400
Livestock farmers raise animals, like cows
and sheep, to produce food.

81
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:46,099
These animals give us meat, and dairy products
like milk, cheese, and butter.

82
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:52,539
The animals often live in open pastures where
they eat grass and other plants.

83
00:06:52,539 --> 00:07:00,150
Some farmers have to travel long distances
with their animals to find green pastures.

84
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,929
Some farm animals, like chickens, are raised
in closed yards.

85
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:09,479
This keeps them together and protects them.

86
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:14,379
Farmers sometimes build houses called coops
where the chickens can sleep and lay their

87
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,050
eggs.

88
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,520
Fishermen

89
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,039
Some fishermen catch fish, like trout, in
lakes and rivers.

90
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:30,270
Other fishermen work at sea where they catch
saltwater fish like tuna or cod.

91
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,909
They also catch seafood like prawns or squid.

92
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:40,429
Some fishermen work far from the coast on
deep-sea fishing boats.

93
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:44,330
They often use very big nets.

94
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,419
Deep-sea fishing boats also have freezers
to keep the fish cold until the fishermen

95
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:52,429
return to the port.

96
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:55,979
Some fish are raised on fish farms.

97
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:01,889
The fish live in artificial ponds or in closed
areas on the coast.

98
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:06,020
This fishing industry is called aquaculture.

99
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:13,479
Some types of shellfish, like oysters, are
also raised this way.

100
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:22,050
Tsukiji Market in Tokyo in Japan is the largest
fish market in the world.

101
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:30,080
It sells about 2,000 metric tons of fish and
seafood every day!

102
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,530
CHAPTER THREE
Food Origins

103
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,550
Some of our favorite foods have a long history.

104
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:44,320
Did you know that popcorn is thousands of
years old?

105
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,270
Do you know who invented potato chips, or
where chocolate was discovered?

106
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,790
Popcorn

107
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:59,450
People started growing corn for food about
8,000 years ago in Central America.

108
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,850
They used the corn in many ways.

109
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,180
They ate it fresh and they used it to make
bread and soups.

110
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,630
Did you know that they also invented popcorn?

111
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,570
In 1948 archaeologists found popcorn in a
cave.

112
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:23,010
It was about 5,500 years old!

113
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:28,310
Native Americans made popcorn by cooking the
corn over a fire.

114
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,690
People enjoyed eating the hot popcorn.

115
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:37,740
They also used it to make decorations and
popcorn necklaces!

116
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,190
Chocolate

117
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:46,110
The native people of Central America also
invented chocolate about 2,000 years ago.

118
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,040
They made a spicy drink from the seeds of
the cacao tree.

119
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,380
First they dried the cacao seeds and crushed
them to make a paste.

120
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,700
Then they added chili peppers and water.

121
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,700
The chocolate drink wasn't sweet - it was
bitter!

122
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,740
Spanish explorers learned about chocolate
when they arrived in America, and it soon

123
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,300
became a popular drink in Spain.

124
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:19,030
Spanish people liked their chocolate hot,
with sugar and cinnamon.

125
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:24,740
Hot chocolate later became popular all over
Europe, and chocolate factories started making

126
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,520
chocolate candy, too.

127
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,890
In 1867 a Swiss chocolate maker named Daniel
Peter invented a chocolate candy made with

128
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,000
milk.

129
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,380
Now milk chocolate is very popular, and cacao
trees are grown in many places.

130
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,370
Ice Cream

131
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:51,330
About 2,000 years ago the Ancient Romans brought
ice and snow from the mountains and mixed

132
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,650
it with fruit and honey.

133
00:10:54,650 --> 00:11:01,470
About 1,500 years ago people in China made
desserts with ice and milk.

134
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:09,730
The soft ice cream that we eat today was probably
invented in Europe about 400 years ago.

135
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,720
Fruit ices were popular in Europe.

136
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,600
Then people started to add cream.

137
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,930
They put the cream in a metal bowl with sugar.

138
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,540
Then they froze it in a bucket of ice.

139
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:30,130
This was hard work because they had to keep
mixing the cream by hand.

140
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:37,950
In 1843 an American woman named Nancy Johnson
invented an ice cream machine.

141
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:46,110
Seven years later the first ice cream factory
opened in Baltimore in the USA.

142
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,030
Potato Chips

143
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:55,200
In 1853 George Crum was a cook in a restaurant
in Saratoga Springs in New York.

144
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,300
One day, a customer said he didn't like George's
French fries.

145
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,800
He said they were too thick!

146
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,780
So George played a joke on the customer.

147
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,010
He made some French fries that were very thin,
like paper.

148
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,860
The customer loved them!

149
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,810
Soon all of George's customers wanted thin
French fries.

150
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,120
George called them Saratoga chips.

151
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,680
In 1860 George opened a new restaurant and
his thin chips became famous all over the

152
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,670
USA.

153
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,680
Today potato chips are one of the most popular
snacks in the world.

154
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:52,690
CHAPTER 

155
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,740
FOUR
Typical Dishes

156
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,070
Every country has typical dishes that are
popular with local people.

157
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,940
These dishes are often made in a traditional
way, with special ingredients.

158
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,790
What types of dishes are typical in your country?

159
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,720
Italy

160
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,280
Pasta is the most typical food in Italy.

161
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:25,790
Italian pasta is made from wheat flour and
comes in many different shapes.

162
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:34,440
For example, spaghetti is long and straight,
spirali pasta is a spiral shape, and stellini

163
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,920
pasta is a star shape.

164
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,720
What type of pasta do you prefer?

165
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,260
Pizza is another typical dish in Italy.

166
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:52,310
Italian pizza is usually made with wheat flour,
tomato, and mozzarella cheese.

167
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:57,460
Some people also add meat, seafood, or vegetables.

168
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:04,610
Most pizzas are round, but in Rome they also
make special square pizzas!

169
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,380
