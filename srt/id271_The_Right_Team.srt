CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,200
The man from England

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,680
In the town of Kasama in Zambia, there's a big game of
football today.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,360
A lot of people are watching.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,240
Kasama United are playing against Black Star.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,800
It's one goal to Kasama and one goal to Black Star.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,600
Now there are only five minutes until the end of the game.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,440
The Kasama goalkeeper has the ball.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,720
He looks up the field.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,000
"To me!" shouts Mumba Siwale.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,240
"Kick it to me!" Mumba is only seventeen years old but he's
Kasama's best player.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,840
The Kasama goalkeeper kicks the ball up the field.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,440
Mumba takes the ball on his foot, and then he turns and runs
towards the Black Star goal.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,200
He runs past one Black Star player, and then past another
player.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,600
The goalkeeper comes out, but Mumba takes the ball past him.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,320
He shoots.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,320
He scores.

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,400
It's a goal!

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:32,920
The Kasama fans stand up and shout, "Goal! Goal to Kasama! Goal to Mumba!" They start shouting Mumba's name, again and
again.

20
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,320
"Mum-ba! Mum-ba! Mum-ba!"

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,880
The game ends.

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,960
The score is Kasama United 2 - Black Star 1.

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,640
Kasama win the game.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,960
Mumba is very happy.

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,360
Sam Chipata is happy too.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,920
He's the manager of Kasama United.

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,640
"A great game, Mumba," says Sam.

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:10,480
"Now, I want you to meet a man from England." A tall man in
a black suit is standing beside Sam.

29
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,760
"This is Tom Delaney," says Sam.

30
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,560
Tom Delaney shakes Mumba's hand and says, "Hello, Mumba."

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,720
"Hello, Mr Delaney," says Mumba.

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,040
"Tom is from Liverpool," says Sam.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,280
"He's from Mersey City. He wants to talk to you."

34
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,600
Mersey City?

35
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,160
Mumba thinks.

36
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,360
They're my favourite team.

37
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,640
Michael Woko plays for Mersey City.

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,480
Does Mr Delaney want me to play for them too?

39
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,160
"Mumba, I want you to come to England," says Tom Delaney.

40
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,080
"I want you to play for Mersey City."

41
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,320
Mumba can't believe it.

42
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,200
He doesn't speak.

43
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,440
Tom Delaney waits.

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,480
"What do you say, Mumba? Do you want to play for Mersey
City?"

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,960
"Of course I do," says Mumba.

46
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:29,120
"But I can't believe it. I love Mersey City! They're my favourite team. They play in League One. I watch them on
television. And Michael Woko is my favourite player. But -"

47
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,840
"You have to talk to Mumba's family, Tom," says Sam Chipata.

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,360
"Mumba is only seventeen years old."

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,440
"Of course," says Tom Delaney.

50
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,000
"I have a letter for Mumba's father. He has to sign it."

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,560
"My father is dead," says Mumba.

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,160
"You have to talk to my mother. She's at home."

53
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,080
Mumba lives with his mother and his young brother, Goodson.

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,280
Goodson is a good footballer too.

55
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,080
At Mumba's house, his mother, Edith Siwale, listens to Tom
Delaney.

56
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:26,760
"Your son is a very good footballer, Mrs Siwale. We want him
to come to England and play for Mersey City. They are a very big team. They play in League One. Mumba is going to be a very rich young man."

57
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,000
Mrs Siwale doesn't speak.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,080
Tom Delaney smiles and says, "He can buy a big house for
you. And a car."

59
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,120
"We have a car," says Mrs Siwale.

60
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,920
"I am a teacher. We are not a poor family."

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,600
"But our car is very old, Mother," says Mumba.

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,480
"It's a good car," his mother says to him.

63
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,160
"We don't need another car." She looks at Tom Delaney.

64
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:18,800
"You talk about money," she says, "but what is going to happen to my son in England? England is not like Zambia.
It's a cold country. And the people are cold too. Is he going to be happy in your country? Mumba is very young -"

65
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,640
"Mother, I'm seventeen. I am a man."

66
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,480
"Be quiet," says Mrs Siwale.

67
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,400
She turns back to Tom Delaney.

68
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,440
"I don't know you, Mr Delaney," she says.

69
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,400
"And I don't like this talk about money."

70
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,960
"But I want to play football in England," says Mumba.

71
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,520
"I want to play for Mersey City."

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,400
"Be quiet," his mother says again.

73
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,320
"I am thinking." She turns to Tom Delaney.

74
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,520
"Come back tomorrow, Mr Delaney," she says.

75
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:05,040
"Come and eat with us. You are new to Zambia. You have to
know something about us. Come tomorrow."

76
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,920
CHAPTER TWO

77
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,320
Goodbye to Kasama

78
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,760
Tom Delaney comes to the Siwale house again.

79
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,960
He eats with the family.

80
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,400
Sam Chipata is there too.

81
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,640
"Thank you for the food, Mrs Siwale," says Tom Delaney.

82
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:41,160
"It's very good. I'm happy to be in your home with your family. Families are important. Our club, Mersey City, is a
family. We look after our players."

83
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,840
Mrs Siwale listens, but she doesn't speak.

84
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,480
"They have players from many countries, Mother," says Mumba.

85
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,520
"Mumba is right, Mrs Siwale," says Sam.

86
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:01,600
"Mersey City have players from all over the world. They have
other players from Africa."

87
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,360
"They have Michael Woko," says Mumba.

88
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,320
"He's from Nigeria. And he's a great player."

89
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,200
"That's right," says Mr Delaney.

90
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,200
"Michael Woko is very happy in England. Mumba can be happy
there too."

91
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,160
"Mersey City is a good club, Mrs Siwale," says Sam.

92
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,640
"I know the people there. They look after their players. You
can sign Mr Delaney's letter."

93
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,480
"What do you say, Mother?" asks Mumba.

94
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,480
"Can I go to England? Can I play for Mersey City?"

95
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,080
Mumba's mother sits and thinks.

96
00:07:43,080 --> 00:08:08,440
Then she says, "Mumba, you are seventeen years old. You are young - you are only a boy. But you are also a man. Your
father is dead, and you are the man in this house. You want to be a good footballer. You want to play in a good team. You are right.

97
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:15,040
You have to go to England and play for this English club.
It's the right team for you."

98
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,840
Then she turns to Tom Delaney.

99
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,440
"Give me your letter, Mr Delaney," she says.

100
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,760
He gives it to her and she signs it.

101
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:34,040
Then she says, "Go, Mumba. Go to England. And be happy!" She
kisses her son.

102
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:41,480
Four weeks later, Mumba and his family are at Lusaka
Airport.

103
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,280
They are waiting for the plane to London.

104
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,240
Sam Chipata is there too, with Mumba's friends from Kasama
United.

105
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,640
"I don't understand," says Goodson Siwale.

106
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,280
"The plane is going to London but you are going to
Liverpool."

107
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,120
Mumba laughs.

108
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,880
"First I have to go to London," he says.

109
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,760
"Then Mr Delaney is going to meet me at London Airport and
take me to Liverpool."

110
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,560
"Are you going to meet Michael Woko?" Goodson asks.

111
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,320
"I'm going to play with Michael Woko!" says Mumba.

112
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,440
"We're going to be in the same team!"

113
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,120
"Listen," says Sam.

114
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:37,920
"They're talking about your flight." They listen: All
passengers on Flight ZM456 to London please go to Gate 2.

115
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,160
Gate 2 for passengers on the London flight.

116
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,520
"That's your flight, Mumba," says Sam.

117
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,200
"You have to go now."

118
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,760
Mumba shakes Sam's hand.

119
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,600
Then he hugs his brother.

120
00:09:51,600 --> 00:10:00,560
His mother says, "Goodbye, Mumba. Call us from England. And
email us. Promise me."

121
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,800
Mumba kisses her and says, "I promise, Mother. Goodbye."

122
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,840
The flight to London is long.

123
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,040
Mumba sleeps.

124
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,760
After seven hours, the plane lands in London.

125
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,640
Mumba looks out of the window.

126
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,520
The sky is grey and there is no sun.

127
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:31,040
It is very different from Kasama, but Mumba is very excited.

128
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,160
Tom Delaney is waiting for him at the airport.

129
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,640
He smiles and shakes Mumba's hand.

130
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,960
"How are you, Mumba?"

131
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,360
"I'm very well, Mr Delaney," says Mumba.

132
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,080
"I'm happy to be here. I'm very excited about playing for
Mersey City."

133
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,680
"I have something to tell you, Mumba," says Tom Delaney.

134
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,920
He isn't smiling now.

135
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,040
"What is it?" asks Mumba.

136
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:07,800
"I'm sorry, Mumba," says Tom Delaney, "but you're not going
to play for Mersey City."

137
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,120
"What? I'm not?" asks Mumba.

138
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,840
"What are you saying?"

139
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,840
"Come on," says Tom Delaney.

140
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,360
"We can't talk here. I can tell you about it in the car."

141
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,360
CHAPTER THREE

142
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,640
News from England

143
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,600
Tom Delaney and Mumba drive away from the airport.

144
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,960
"I don't understand," says Mumba.

145
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,280
"Where are we going? Are we going to Liverpool?"

146
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,920
"No, we're not," says Tom Delaney.

147
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:53,040
"You're not going to play for Mersey City - not now. I'm
sorry, Mumba, but Mersey City don't want you now."

148
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,520
"But in Kasama, you -"

149
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,720
"Forget about Kasama," says Tom Delaney.

150
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,760
"You're in England now."

151
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,080
"What about the letter?"

152
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,160
"Forget about the letter," says Tom Delaney.

153
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:19,400
"Listen, Mumba, you're not ready for Mersey City. You're young. You need to play more football. And you can! Another
team wants you."

154
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,480
"Another team? What team?"

155
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,560
"You're going to play for Blackport United. They want good
young players -"

156
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,600
"Blackport United? I don't know this team," says Mumba.

157
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
"Do they play in League One?"

158
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:49,360
"No, Mumba. They play in League Three. But they are a good club for you. They have a good manager. And they look after
young players. I'm taking you to Blackport."

159
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,520
Mumba doesn't speak.

160
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,640
He wants to cry, but he doesn't.

161
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,240
He looks out of the window.

162
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,480
The streets are grey.

163
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,280
I'm not going to play for Mersey City, he thinks.

164
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,040
I'm not going to play with Michael Woko.

165
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:15,120
I'm going to play for Blackport United - but that's not the
right team for me!

168
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,120
Hello Mother

169
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,720
How are you?

170
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,640
Are you all well in Kasama?

171
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,640
It's awful here!

172
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,680
Blackport is an awful town.

173
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,480
It's cold and dirty and it rains here all the time.

174
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,200
It's raining now.

175
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
I'm in bed.

176
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,760
I'm not well, and I'm not playing for the team this week.

177
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,600
I have no friends here.

178
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,200
The other players don't talk to me.

179
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,040
And football in England is very different from football in
Zambia.

180
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,920
The players in other teams kick you.

181
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,480
And Blackport United is not the right team for me.

182
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,880
Is the sun shining in Kasama now?

183
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,200
I want to come home.

184
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,320
With love to everyone at home

185
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,640
Your son

186
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Mumba

187
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,280
From: ediths@zamcom.zm

188
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,520
To: mumbas@blackport.org.uk

189
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,640
My dear son

190
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,400
I am sorry to read your email.

191
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,120
Life is different in England.

192
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,600
You are not happy now.

193
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,520
I know that.

194
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,400
But you have to do your best.

195
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,600
You have to work hard.

196
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,960
England is different from Zambia.

197
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,560
But there are good people there.

198
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,920
You have to make friends with the other players.

199
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,200
You have to understand them.

200
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,760
Then they can be your friends.

201
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,520
Your loving mother

202
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,400
(The sun is not shining in Kasama today.

203
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
It is raining here.

204
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,480
And it's going to rain for the next four weeks!)

205
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,920
Mumba reads his mother's email.

206
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,240
She is right, he thinks.

207
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,280
I have to make friends.

208
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,360
I have to understand the English players.

209
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,920
And I have to start today!

210
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,920
CHAPTER FOUR

211
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,640
The right team

212
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,600
Lee Miller is looking at his mobile phone.

213
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,680
"Hey, look at this, Mumba," he says.

214
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,360
"What is it, Lee?" asks Mumba.

215
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,000
Lee and Mumba are friends.

216
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,600
Lee is quiet, like Mumba.

217
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,560
He doesn't shout.

218
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,400
He plays for Blackport too, but he's not like the other
Blackport players.

219
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,040
"We're going to play a big club - a League One club."

220
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,960
"Which club?" Mumba asks.

221
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,760
"Mersey City," says Lee.

222
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,960
"We're going to play against Mersey City. What do you think
about that?"

223
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,080
Things at Blackport are okay for Mumba now.

224
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,760
It's April and it doesn't rain every day.

225
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,280
Sometimes the sun shines!

226
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,640
And Mumba is playing in the Blackport United first team.

227
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,960
He is scoring goals and the Blackport fans like him.

228
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,720
"Mum-ba!" they shout.

229
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,200
"Mum-ba!"

230
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,280
Blackport United's manager is Ron Carter.

231
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,520
He likes Mumba too.

232
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,480
Some of the big clubs come to watch his young Zambian
player.

233
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,800
Some of them want Mumba to come to their club.

234
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,040
But Blackport don't want Mumba to go.

235
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,760
"Mumba Siwale is staying at Blackport," says Ron.

236
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,560
Mumba is happy to stay at Blackport now.

237
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,480
And now Blackport are going to play against Mersey City!

238
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,000
I want to play with Michael Woko, thinks Mumba.

239
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,320
But now I'm going to play against him!

240
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,520
"We can beat Mersey City," Mumba says to Lee.

241
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,600
"But they're a big club, and we're a small club," says Lee.

242
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,520
"We can beat them," Mumba says again.

243
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,880
Back in Kasama, Goodson Siwale sits at the computer.

244
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,000
He's listening to the game on the radio:

245
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:52,240
It's half time and the score is Blackport United 1 - Mersey
City 1.

246
00:17:52,280 --> 00:18:00,040
Yes, Blackport from League Three and Mersey City, the League
One club, have one goal each!

247
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,800
And that's thanks to a great goal by Blackport's young
African player, Mumba Siwale.

248
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,400
And now the second half of the game is starting.

249
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,480
Lee Miller of Blackport has the ball.

250
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,040
He looks up and sees Siwale.

251
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,240
He kicks the ball to Siwale.

252
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,200
Siwale turns and shoots.

253
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
He scores!

254
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,040
It's another goal from Mumba Siwale!

255
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,480
I don't believe it!

256
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,040
Now it's 2 - 1 to Blackport, thanks to Mumba Siwale.

257
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,400
Two goals!

258
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,160
He's a great young player!

259
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:44,600
Now everyone here is asking the same question: Are Blackport United of League Three going to beat Mersey City, the big
team of League One?

260
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,600
"Mother!" Goodson says.

261
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,280
"Come and listen. Mumba's team are going to win!"

262
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,280
But Blackport United don't beat Mersey City.

263
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:04,080
Michael Woko scores two goals and Mersey City win the game
by three goals to two.

264
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,600
At the end of the game, Michael Woko comes up to Mumba and
shakes his hand.

265
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,000
"A great game, Siwale," he says.

266
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,920
"Two great goals!"

267
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,880
"Two great goals to you too," says Mumba.

268
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,240
"Can I please have your shirt? You can have my shirt."

269
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,200
"Yes, okay."

270
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,920
Michael gives Mumba his shirt.

271
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,360
Mumba gives his shirt to Michael, and the two players shake
hands again.

272
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,600
The Blackport fans are shouting Mumba's name.

273
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,560
"Mum- ha, Mum-ba!"

274
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,400
And then Ron Carter comes up to him.

275
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,000
"A great game, Mumba," he says.

276
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,880
And now I want you to meet someone.

277
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,080
You know him."

278
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,240
A tall man in a black suit is behind Ron.

279
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,320
It's Tom Delaney.

280
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,240
"Hello, Mumba," he says.

281
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,800
"Hello, Mr Delaney," Mumba says.

282
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,400
But he isn't happy to see him.

283
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,760
What does he want? he thinks.

284
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:21,600
Tom Delaney smiles and says, "You're wearing a Mersey City
shirt, Mumba. That's good to see!"

285
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,240
"Oh, it's Michael Woko's shirt," says Mumba.

286
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,520
"I've got good news for you," Tom Delaney says.

287
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,320
"We want you to come and play for Mersey City. What do you
say?"

288
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,760
Can I believe him?

289
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,120
Mumba thinks.

290
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,880
But he doesn't speak.

291
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,920
"Give Mr Delaney an answer, Mumba," says Ron.

292
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,840
"What do you say?"

293
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,080
"It's okay, Ron," says Tom Delaney.

294
00:20:52,080 --> 00:21:09,720
"Listen, Mumba, I understand. You're thinking, Can I believe him? I'm sorry about last year. But it's true. Mersey City
want you to play for them. You're ready for League One now."

295
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,160
Mumba turns to Ron and asks, "What do you say, Ron?"

296
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,800
"It's okay, Mumba," says Ron.

297
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:26,680
"I understand. You have to go. Mersey City is the right team
for you now."

298
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,600
The right team?

299
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,920
Yes, Mumba thinks.

300
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,880
I'm going to play for the right team now.

301
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,520
"So, what do you say, Mumba?" asks Tom Delaney.

302
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,760
"Yes!"

303
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,680
CHAPTER FIVE

304
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,760
The big game

305
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,720
One year later

306
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:00,400

308
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,600
Hello Mother

309
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,720
How are you?

310
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,720
I am very happy in Liverpool.

311
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,840
I am playing well.

312
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:19,040
I play in the Mersey City second team, but sometimes I get a
game in the first team.

313
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,120
And then I play with Michael Woko!

314
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,440
Michael and I are great friends.

315
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,200
He's very nice to me and helps me.

316
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,720
He wants to come to Kasama!

317
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,320
The team is playing well this year.

318
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:43,080
Tomorrow we are playing against a Spanish team, Sporting
Catalunya, in the final of the Euro Cup.

319
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,240
But I'm not going to play in the game.

320
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,280
I'm a substitute - I have to sit and watch it.

321
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,120
But sometimes substitutes go on and play.

322
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,400
Who knows?

323
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,200
The game is on television.

324
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,920
Are you going to watch it?

325
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,720
With love to everyone at home

326
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,000

330
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,120
My dear son

331
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,840
I know about the big game tomorrow.

332
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,160
All the newspapers here are talking about it.

333
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,040
They are all talking about you too.

334
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,600
There are big television screens in the centre of Kasama.

335
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,080
Thousands of people are going to watch it there.

336
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,120
And yes, I'm going to watch it too!

337
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,960
Good luck, Mumba.

338
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,760
Your loving mother

339
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:52,520
It's the day of the big game - Mersey City against Sporting
Catalunya in the Euro Cup final in Frankfurt.

340
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,440
There are thousands of fans at the game.

341
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:03,880
They are shouting for the two teams - some for the English
team, and some for the Spanish team.

342
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,200
Mumba sits with the other substitutes and watches the game.

343
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,560
It's a great game, but there are no goals.

344
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,960
The Spanish goalkeeper is playing well.

345
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,400
Three times Michael Woko shoots and three times the Spanish
goalkeeper stops the ball.

346
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:31,800
In their home, Goodson and Edith Siwale are watching the
game on television:

347
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,200
Mersey City can't score.

348
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,440
The Spanish goalkeeper stops every shot.

349
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,000
There are only ten minutes to go...

350
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,240
Now what's this?

351
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,320
There's something wrong with Michael Woko.

352
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,480
He's coming off!

353
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,160
This is very bad for Mersey City.

354
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,520
Who's going to come on for the last ten minutes?

355
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,120
It's...

356
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,640
Yes, it's the young player from Zambia, Mumba Siwale!

357
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,400
He's a good player, but he's only eighteen years old.

358
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,920
You have to ask: What can he do?

359
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,640
"Do you see, Mother?" says Goodson.

360
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,760
"Mumba's going on!"

361
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,560
Edith is crying.

362
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,320
But she's smiling too.

363
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,520
"Yes, I see. Play well, Mumba."

364
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,000
Mumba is very excited.

365
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,560
He's playing in the Euro Cup final!

366
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,080
The game is very fast.

367
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,920
He can't get the ball.

368
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,440
Then Mersey City get a corner kick.

369
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,480
There is only one minute left now.

370
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,240
Mumba waits.

371
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,440
The ball comes over and he jumps and heads the ball towards
the goal.

372
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,080
The Spanish goalkeeper tries to stop it, but he can't.

373
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,880
It's a goal!

374
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,400
A goal for Mersey City!

375
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,440
The other players run up to Mumba and hug him.

376
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,800
"It's our Cup!" they shout.

377
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,880
"It's our Cup!"

378
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,440
The game ends, and Mersey City win 1 - 0.

379
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,320
The Mersey City fans cheer and shout.

380
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,200
"Mum-ba! Mum- ba! Mum-ba!"

381
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,520
Now a television reporter is talking to Mumba and Michael
Woko.

382
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,280
"A great game, Michael," he says.

383
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,880
"How does it feel to win the Cup?"

384
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,040
"It feels great. But talk to Mumba here. What a great goal!"

385
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,120
"Okay, Mumba. How does it feel to win the Cup?"

386
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:56,320
"I'm very happy. I don't score many goals with my head. But it's not about me, it's about the team. Mersey City is a
great team. And Michael here is a real friend. He helps me so much."

387
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,400
"Thousands of people in Zambia are watching the game. What
do you want to say to them?"

388
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:10,000
"I want to say thanks to all the people in Zambia. I'm going
to come back to Kasama soon."

389
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,680
"Mumba, someone in Kasama wants to talk to you. Look at this
screen."

390
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,240
Mumba looks at the television screen and sees his mother.

391
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,160
"Hello, Mumba," she says.

392
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,560
"I'm very happy for you, son. Are you going to come home
soon?"

393
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,680
"Yes, I am," says Mumba.

394
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,280
"Can I bring Michael Woko with me, Mother?"

395
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,880
His mother laughs.

396
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,040
"Oh yes," she says.

397
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,280
"Michael can come too!"
