CHAPTER ONE
The Photograph

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:16,110
In today's world there are photographs everywhere
- web pages on the internet, magazines full

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:24,070
of fashion and film stars, newspapers full
of photos of war and sport, places and people

4
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,380
from other lands.

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,480
They say a picture is worth a thousand words,
and maybe it is, but what is the picture telling

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,780
us?

7
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:57,140
Sometimes we only see what we want to see...

8
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:06,150
Make a picture in your mind: a girl with thin
cheeks and tired eyes.

9
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,150
Her arms and legs are as thin as sticks; she
is only skin and bone.

10
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:19,700
Clouds of dust circle above her head as the
food trucks drive away.

11
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:26,610
Their wheels leave marks on the dry ground,
and soon only, the marks show that the food

12
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,390
trucks came to the village, and left.

13
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:42,240
The sun is at its hottest; the African sky
is unending and cruel.

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,650
Even the white men with cameras, busily taking
photographs of the usual fighting over the

15
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,860
food, are now getting ready to leave.

16
00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:00,170
They pack away their cameras, jump into their
cars, and drive quickly away to cool, modern

17
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,549
hotels in a city miles away.

18
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:09,619
They are photojournalists.

19
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:16,760
One of them, sunburned and hot, dressed in
a shirt and jeans, kneels down on the dusty

20
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,420
ground to take some photographs of the girl
before he leaves.

21
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:34,010
In the pocket of his shirt, is a protein bar,
soft from the sun, uneaten, untouched, forgotten.

22
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:41,480
He doesn't stop to think about the uneaten
bar in his pocket and the starving girl.

23
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,120
He is only one man.

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,590
What can one man do in a world where life
is cruel, and governments cannot or will not

25
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,000
help their people?

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,769
And who wants to stay in a place like this,
with its dirt and its terrible smells, if

27
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:07,550
they can drive away from it?

28
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,750
The girl caught the photographer's eye.

29
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:18,209
She was in the middle of a group of boys,
fighting just as strongly as they were, when

30
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:21,620
the food trucks arrived.

31
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,409
But she was pushed down and fell under the
boys' feet.

32
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:35,660
The boys stepped all over her, and when she
could move again, the bags of rice were all

33
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,739
gone.

34
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:47,319
She stayed there, red-eyed, moving her fingers
slowly over the dusty ground.

35
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:56,020
The journalist takes his last photo, returns
to America with his bag full of films.

36
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:04,989
One of his photographs of the girl sells and
is placed on the front cover of a news magazine.

37
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:12,299
'You've caught the face of hunger in Africa,'
the news editor tells him.

38
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:19,739
He wants to tell the editor that this photograph
is just one face, in one village, in a country

39
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,830
full of hungry faces.

40
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,110
But he does not say it.

41
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,650
The photograph is good for him.

42
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:39,099
More people admire his work and want to buy
his photographs for their magazines and newspapers.

43
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:44,979
The photograph is in most news stores by the
end of the month, even in those bookstores

44
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:51,839
where people go only to read the magazines
and not to buy.

45
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,979
They look at the face of the African girl,
and quickly turn away to enjoy the rest of

46
00:04:57,979 --> 00:04:59,699
their shopping trip.

47
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:07,460
But the girl's picture stays in their minds.

48
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:14,960
A teenager has just finished looking at the
clothes in Vogue, an expensive fashion magazine.

49
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,789
She sees the photograph under the heading
STARVING AFRICA.

50
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,439
Her parents are from Africa.

51
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:35,210
She herself was born and schooled in America,
watching American TV, American films, and

52
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,960
has never travelled out of America.

53
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,990
She is uncomfortable with photographs like
these.

54
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:51,939
She remembers her classmates in school, who
joke about starving Africans.

55
00:05:51,939 --> 00:06:00,430
She isn't African in that kind of way, but
she isn't truly American either.

56
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:07,249
When she was younger, Cinderella, Snow White,
and all the other girls and princesses in

57
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:12,479
the Disney films didn't look like her.

58
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:19,080
When she was older and became interested in
fashion, the models on the magazine covers

59
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,270
didn't look like her either.

60
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:28,059
Then the magazines found out that Africa had
beautiful women.

61
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:39,240
A Nigerian model is in the latest copy of
Vogue, dressed in blue, and thin, so thin.

62
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:46,219
The teenager feels the fat at the top of her
legs.

63
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:49,129
She wants to be thin like the model.

64
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:53,870
She wants to wear jeans that are like a second
skin.

65
00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:02,439
She wants a photograph of herself with cool,
unsmiling eyes like the Nigerian model.

66
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:09,849
She is careful about what she eats, and if
she eats too much, she puts her finger down

67
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:15,139
her throat to make herself sick.

68
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:24,379
Why does our world have people who starve,
and people who decide to starve themselves?

69
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:28,060
It doesn't matter why.

70
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,479
The hunger inside this teenager is real.

71
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:42,159
So she stares at the girl in the photograph,
does not think about the dry dusty hungry

72
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:55,949
land behind her, and admires her cheek bones.

73
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:01,849
- THE END -
