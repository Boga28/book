00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,859
CHAPTER ONE
It was Friday afternoon in the office of Babbitt

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:09,540
Cars, Los Angeles.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,190
Charlie Babbitt was shouting on the phone.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,900
'But I have waited five weeks for these cars.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,640
Where are they?'

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,640
On another phone, Charlie's secretary, Susanna,
was talking to a customer.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,130
The customer wanted six Lamborghini cars and
he wanted them that day.

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,699
Then a call came from the bank.

9
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:37,899
Susanna put her hand over the phone.

10
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,160
'They want you to pay back the money you borrowed,'
she said.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,519
'They want it this afternoon.'

12
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:50,699
'Tell them I'll pay oft Monday,' said Charlie.

13
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:52,780
Then he spoke into his own phone.

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,050
'You can have the cars on Monday, sir...

15
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,480
Yes, I'm sure...

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,910
Thank you, sir!'

17
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,910
Charlie put the phone down and smiled for
the first time in a week.

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,260
Monday.

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,610
And this was only Friday!

20
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,360
He had the weekend to think of something to
save his business.

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,870
He looked over at Susanna, his Italian secretary.

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,820
She was his girl and she was so beautiful!

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,300
Charlie loved every part of her little body,
her big black eyes, her long brown hair.

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,960
'Are you ready for our weekend in Palm Springs?'

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,240
Susanna looked surprised.

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,460
'We're still going?'

27
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,980
'Of course,' said Charlie.

28
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,590
'Don't worry about this little problem.

29
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,050
I'm going to make eighty thousand dollars
from those cars.'

30
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,610
He smiled his best smile.

31
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:59,550
'Not bad... for two or three phone calls.'

32
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:05,580
They were driving through the desert when
a call came through on Charlie's car phone.

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,229
'Mr Babbitt?

34
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,679
Mr Charles Babbitt?'

35
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,030
It was a girl's voice.

36
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,540
'Yes?'

37
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,069
'I'm calling for Mr John Mooney.

38
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,260
He's your father's lawyer...

39
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,569
here in Cincinnati.

40
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:21,569
And...

41
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:25,939
I'm sorry, but it's bad news.

42
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:29,160
Your father has died, sir.'

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,360
'Oh, no!'

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,700
Susanna said, her eyes on Charlie.

45
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,870
But his face didn't change, and he didn't
say a word.

46
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,269
'The funeral is on Sunday, Mr Babbitt.

47
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:47,659
I've got his telephone number if you...'

48
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:50,459
But Charlie was not listening.

49
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,969
He just continued to look at the road in front
of them.

50
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:57,930
'Oh, Charlie,' Susanna said softly.

51
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,969
'Are you all right?'

52
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:08,109
He didn't answer, but a few seconds later
he turned off the road and stopped the car.

53
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:13,760
'Sorry about the weekend,' he said finally.

54
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,200
'The weekend?'

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,099
Susanna said.

56
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,939
'Charlie -'

57
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:24,810
Charlie did not look at her.

58
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:31,159
'Look,' he said quietly, 'I hated my father
and he hated me.'

59
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,069
Susanna looked across at him.

60
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:40,469
Charlie was only twenty-six, but she thought
he was the most handsome man in the world.

61
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:47,390
He was tall and strong, with thick dark hair
and a wonderful smile.

62
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,049
'Poor Charlie!

63
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,349
That's very sad.'

64
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,559
'My mother died when I was two.

65
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,559
And then it was just...

66
00:03:57,559 --> 00:04:02,549
me and him.'

67
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,829
Susanna bit her lip and touched Charlie on
the shoulder.

68
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,030
'What happened?'

69
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,739
Charlie was silent.

70
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,999
Then he said, 'Nothing I did was ever good
enough for him.'

71
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:23,280
'I'm going with you to the funeral,' Susanna
said suddenly.

72
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,410
Charlie smiled.

73
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,460
'That's nice,' he said, 'but you don't need
to.'

74
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,370
'I want to go,' Susanna said.

75
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,009
Charlie looked across at Susanna.

76
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:42,990
'I forgot who I was talking to,' he said,
with a small, sad smile.

77
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,650
CHAPTER TWO
Charlie Babbitt walked away from his father's

78
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,180
funeral without looking back.

79
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,550
Getting into the car beside Susanna, he said,
'We're going to stay in Cincinnati another

80
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,430
night, OK?

81
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,199
There's something I have to do before we go.'

82
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,740
Charlie started the car.

83
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,220
'Where are we going now?'

84
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,820
Susanna asked.

85
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,490
'East Walnut Hills.'

86
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,430
Walnut Hills is the richest part of Cincinnati.

87
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:22,120
All the houses are big and very expensive.

88
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,659
Charlie parked the car in front of one of
the largest, most expensive houses in Walnut

89
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,819
Hills - Sanford Babbitt's house.

90
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:35,379
'This is my father's place,' he said.

91
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:37,960
Susanna got out of the car.

92
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,240
'Is this where you lived when you were a boy?'

93
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,180
she asked, her eyes wide, full of questions.

94
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,740
'Yeah, but I left when I was sixteen,' Charlie
said.

95
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,099
He picked up the suitcases and carried them
towards the house.

96
00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:04,780
'I had no idea... you came... from all this,'
Susanna said.

97
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,770
This was a Charlie Babbitt that she didn't
know.

98
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,379
But Charlie wasn't listening.

99
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:18,800
He put the suitcases down and walked towards
a car that was in front of the garage.

100
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,569
It was a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.

101
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:28,099
It was light blue and everything about it
was perfect.

102
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:36,300
'I've always known this car,' Charlie said
in a quiet voice, 'but I only drove it once.'

103
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,870
Near the garage was a flower garden with some
wonderful roses.

104
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:46,439
'Someone must water those roses,' said Susanna,
who loved flowers.

105
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,220
'They're all dying.'

106
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,889
'I hate those roses!'

107
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,150
Charlie said suddenly.

108
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:03,650
Susanna looked at him in surprise, but Charlie
was already opening the front door.

109
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,009
Later that afternoon, Charlie and Susanna
were looking round Charlie's old bedroom.

110
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:13,310
'You know that car in front of the garage?'

111
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,060
Charlie asked suddenly.

112
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,060
'It's beautiful.'

113
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,810
'My father loved that car.

114
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,330
The car and the roses.

115
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,099
The Buick was his car and I could never drive
it.

116
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,750
But one day I borrowed it to drive my friends
round town.'

117
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,380
'What happened?'

118
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,530
'My father telephoned the police.

119
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:46,389
He knew I had the car, but he telephoned the
police and said, "Someone has stolen my car".

120
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:51,949
The police stopped us and took us to the police
station.'

121
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:54,250
Charlie's face was angry now.

122
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,100
'My friends' parents came for them after an
hour.

123
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,770
My father left me there for two days.'

124
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,699
'Two days!'

125
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,289
Susanna said.

126
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:09,620
'And you were only sixteen.

127
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,500
Poor Charlie!'

128
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,590
But now Charlie was picking up an old coat
from a box in the corner of the room.

129
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,610
'Is that yours, Charlie?'

130
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,260
Susanna asked.

131
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,080
Charlie didn't answer.

132
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,960
He was looking carefully at the little coat.

133
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,300
'It's like a map...' he said, in a strange
voice.

134
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,979
'A map of my past.'

135
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:42,310
'What are you talking about?'

136
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,490
'What?'

137
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,649
Charlie looked over at Susanna and then back
at the coat.

138
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:49,790
'Oh, I was just thinking...

139
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:58,340
Susanna, when you were a child, did you have...
secret friends?'

140
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,140
'Yes, I think everyone does.'

141
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,720
'What was the name of my secret friend?'

142
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,890
Charlie asked himself.

143
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,940
He tried to remember.

144
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,399
'Rain Man.

145
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,490
That's it.

146
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,510
The Rain Man.

147
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:23,610
When I was frightened I held this coat and
listened to the Rain Man sing.'

148
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,720
He smiled.

149
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,399
'That was a long time ago.'

150
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,519
Susanna laughed and touched Charlie's arm.

151
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,060
'What happened to your friend?'

152
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,459
'I don't know,' Charlie said.

153
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:42,200
'I just... grew up, I think.'

154
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,380
He turned the coat around in his hands for
a few seconds longer.

155
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,740
Then he threw it back into the box.

156
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,850
'Let's go and eat.'

157
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:00,610
Charlie Babbitt and his father's lawyer, John
Mooney, met in the dining-room that evening.

158
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:06,950
Mr Mooney put on his glasses and took some
papers from his case.

159
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,250
'Before I read the will,' he said, 'your father
has asked me to read you a letter that he

160
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,790
wrote to you.

161
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,810
Is that all right?'

162
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:20,000
Charlie did not want to listen to his father's
letter.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,620
But he did want his father's money.

164
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,230
'Of course,' he said.

165
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:31,270
Mooney opened an envelope and took out two
pieces of expensive paper.

166
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,480
'"To my son, Charles Babbitt.

167
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,430
Dear Charles,"' the lawyer began.

168
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,120
'"Today is my seventieth birthday.

169
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,980
I am an old man, but I well remember the day
that we brought you home from the hospital.

170
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,260
You were the perfect child..."'

171
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,320
'He wrote it,' Charlie said, with a very small
smile.

172
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,709
'I hear his voice.'

173
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:05,769
'"And I remember too,"' Mooney continued reading,
'"the day you left home.

174
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:11,160
You were so angry, and you had all these big
ideas..."'

175
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,700
The lawyer stopped reading.

176
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,700
He looked up at Charlie, but there was no
change in the young man's expression.

177
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,010
Mooney did not look up from the letter again.

178
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:30,399
'"You did not write, or telephone, or come
back into my life in any way.

179
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,490
For all these years I have not had a son.

180
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,510
But I want for you now what I always wanted
for you.

181
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,350
I want you to have the best life possible."'

182
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:49,089
John Mooney stopped reading and put the letter
back into its envelope.

183
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:52,420
The old lawyer seemed sad.

184
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,490
Charlie did not say anything.

185
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,820
He just sat there waiting for Mooney to read
the will.

186
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,860
Now Mooney picked up the will.

187
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,240
Without looking at Charlie, he began to read.

188
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,190
'"To Charles Sanford Babbitt, I give my 1949
Buick.

189
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,570
I also give him my roses."'

190
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,980
Charlie moved anxiously in his chair.

191
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,110
He did not like what he was hearing.

192
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:31,280
'"I am leaving my home and all my money to
someone who is very important to me.

193
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:38,680
Because this person cannot use the money,
a friend will look after the money for him."'

194
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,259
Mooney stopped reading and looked up.

195
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:45,680
'I don't understand,' Charlie said.

196
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,680
'Your father's money, around three million
dollars, will go to someone who cannot use

197
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,279
it,' Mooney explained.

198
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,130
'Another person will look after the money.'

199
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:05,490
So Charlie Babbitt was not getting his father's
house, or his father's money.

200
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:11,990
'What's the name of the person who is going
to get the money?' he asked.

201
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,860
John Mooney put the will back into his bag.

202
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,710
'The will says that I cannot tell you.'

203
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,720
Charlie was beginning to get angry.

204
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,959
'Who is this person who's going to look after
the money?

205
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,350
You?'

206
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,779
'No, it isn't me,' Mooney said.

207
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,910
The old lawyer stood up and picked up his
hat.

208
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,880
'Who is it then?'

209
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,589
'I'm sorry, Charles,' Mooney said.

210
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,519
'I'm your father's lawyer.

211
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,180
I can't tell you.'

212
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,529
He walked towards the door and then turned
to face Charlie.

213
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,710
'I'm sorry, son.

214
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,920
I can see that you're upset, but -'

215
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,529
'Upset?'

216
00:13:58,529 --> 00:13:59,899
Charlie jumped out of his chair.

217
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,640
'I get an old car and some roses.

218
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,839
Wonderful!

219
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:06,980
And this man without a name -'

220
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
'Charles -'

221
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,069
'This secret person gets three million dollars!'

222
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:13,199
'Charles -'

223
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,449
'Sanford Babbitt.

224
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:18,790
You want to be his son for five minutes?'

225
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,790
Charlie shouted.

226
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,699
'Did you hear that letter?

227
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:25,149
Were you listening?'

228
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:27,980
Charlie was so angry, he could not continue
speaking.

229
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:36,329
'Yes, sir, I was,' John Mooney replied, looking
at Charlie straight in the eye.

230
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:39,930
'Were you?'

231
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:46,060
CHAPTER THREE
Charlie wanted that three million dollars.

232
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,470
It was his money!

233
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,730
But first he had to know who was looking after
it.

234
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,959
Next morning, he went to his father's hank
and talked to a woman there.

235
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,480
He smiled his beautiful smile and lied to
her.

236
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,319
Five minutes later he had the name and address
that he needed in his pocket.

237
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:13,560
Dr Walter Bruner of Wallbrook Home, Ohio.

238
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,600
With Susanna next to him, Charlie drove the
Buick out of Cincinnati.

239
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,819
It was a hot July day and they had the roof
of the car open.

240
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:27,470
On both sides of the road were the Ohio hills.

241
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,000
'This is beautiful,' Susanna said.

242
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,290
'Where are we going?'

243
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:38,190
'We're going to see a Dr Bruner,' Charlie
answered.

244
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,940
He did not say another word.

245
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,019
Twenty minutes later Charlie slowed the car
down and turned to the left.

246
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:49,940
The new road was very narrow.

247
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,230
On both sides there were big trees.

248
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,930
'This is the place,' he said, 'Wallbrook Home.'

249
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,680
'But why have we come here, Charlie?'

250
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,699
Susanna asked.

251
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,800
'It's something about my father's will,' Charlie
said.

252
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,410
'It won't take long.'

253
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,220
On the way up to the house, they saw a strange
man.

254
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:23,089
There was paint all over his face and he was
smiling like a child.

255
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:25,839
They got out of the car and walked up to the
front door.

256
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,160
A nurse came out to meet them.

257
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,450
'I'd like to see Dr Bruner, please.'

258
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,509
The nurse took them into a comfortable waiting-room.

259
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:40,279
'Could you wait here, please?'

260
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,810
The nurse left the room.

261
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,870
Charlie jumped up and went through a door
into another room.

262
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,830
'Charlie,' Susanna called.

263
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,029
'Where are you going?'

264
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:57,540
She followed him into the other room where
a group of people were watching television.

265
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,420
Others sat at tables, playing with children's
games.

266
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,120
Two nurses in white coats sat at the back
of the room.

267
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,970
Nobody spoke.

268
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,750
'I don't like being here, Charlie,' Susanna
said.

269
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,490
'It isn't right!

270
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,069
Let's go back to the waiting-room.'

271
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,390
Dr Bruner was a big man.

272
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:26,320
He was about fifty-six, with grey hair and
a calm face.

273
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,100
'Could you please tell me the name of the
person who will get my father's money?'

274
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,250
Charlie asked politely.

275
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,270
'I'm sorry.

276
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,960
I cannot tell you that.'

277
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,200
Just like Mooney.

278
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,110
'Why is it a secret?'

279
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,120
Charlie left his chair and went over to stand
by the window.

280
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,390
'Is this person...

281
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,660
an old girlfriend of Dad's?'

282
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,570
From the window, Charlie could see the old
Buick.

283
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:00,140
Susanna was sitting in the back, enjoying
the afternoon sun.

284
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,880
A small man, carrying a bag, moved towards
the car.

285
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,450
He walked in a strange way, moving from side
to side.

286
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:20,940
'Mr Babbitt, I knew your father from the time
you were two years old,' Dr Bruner said softly.

287
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,940
Charlie turned.

288
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,450
'The year my mother died,' he said quickly.

289
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,410
'Yes,' said Bruner.

290
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:35,200
'Now, the will names me as the person to look
after the money.

291
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,090
But this hospital and I get none of that money.

292
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,390
I am doing this for your father.'

293
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,960
Charlie was beginning to feel very angry.

294
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,980
To calm himself, he turned back to the window.

295
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,480
The man with the bag was now standing next
to the Buick.

296
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,280
'And you want me to just forget about the
money?'

297
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,080
'I think you have been upset,' Bruner said
softly, 'by a.

298
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,419
man who never knew how to show love.'

299
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,179
Charlie knew that this was true.

300
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,909
He did not know what to say.

301
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:20,419
Outside, the man was taking a small notebook
out of his bag.

302
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:22,630
He began writing in it.

303
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:28,090
'I understand how you feel,' Dr Bruner continued.

304
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,870
'But there's nothing I can do.'

305
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:36,810
'I'll fight for my money, Dr Bruner,' Charlie
said.

306
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,980
Dr Bruner got up from his chair.

307
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,679
'I'm sure you are a fighter, Mr Babbitt,'
he said.

308
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,750
'Your father was a fighter.

309
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,010
But I am a fighter too.'

310
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,900
Dr Bruner walked with Charlie out through
the front door.

311
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,490
The day was getting hotter, but it was still
beautiful weather.

312
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,789
The little man with the bag was still standing
by the Buick.

313
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:06,710
He was writing in his notebook.

314
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,700
Again and again he looked from the car back
to the notebook.

315
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,900
He did not look at Susanna.

316
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:20,710
'Raymond,' said Dr Bruner, 'go back inside.'

317
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,340
The man with the notebook was not listening.

318
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,840
He continued writing in the notebook.

319
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,750
Charlie walked past him and went to open the
door.

320
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:36,650
'Of course, this car is not white,' Raymond
said.

321
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,240
He did not look up from his notebook.

322
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,970
'This is a blue car now...'

323
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,380
Charlie looked at Raymond in surprise.

324
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,290
He was a small man of about forty.

325
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:55,200
He looked clean and tidy, with short hair
and very ordinary clothes.

326
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,870
What was a little strange was that there was
no expression on his face.

327
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:05,070
There was no light in his small black eyes,
and no movement in his mouth.

328
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,820
It was a face that was neither happy nor sad.

329
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,290
Smiling, Charlie turned to Susanna.

330
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:19,040
'You know,' he said slowly, 'this car was
white.

331
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,470
My dad painted it blue when I was very little.'

332
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:30,799
'And, and,' Raymond continued quickly to himself,
'... it cost an arm and a leg.'

333
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,230
The smile left Charlie's face.

334
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:39,280
'That's what my father often said - "an arm
and a leg".

335
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,400
How does this man know that?' he asked.

336
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,299
Charlie looked at the man called Raymond.

337
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:47,529
Raymond looked up for a second.

338
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:50,659
Then he looked at his notebook again,

339
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:53,750
'You come with me, Raymond,' Dr Bruner said.

340
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,299
'These people have to go.'

341
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,720
But Charlie was moving closer to Raymond.

342
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,710
'Do you know this car?' he asked.

343
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,770
A frightened expression came across Raymond's
face.

344
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,669
He looked at Dr Bruner for help.

345
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:17,799
'I... don't... know,' he muttered.

346
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:21,160
'Yes, you do know this car!'

347
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,410
Charlie said angrily.

348
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,090
'Why do you know?'

349
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,340
'That's enough, Mr Babbitt,' Dr Bruner said.

350
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,010
'You're upsetting him.

351
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,010
You're -'

352
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:35,409
'Charlie, please,' Susanna said.

353
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:38,820
Now Raymond looked from Susanna to Dr Bruner.

354
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,970
He began writing in his notebook and muttering
to himself.

355
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,360
'Babbitt Charlie.

356
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,559
Charlie...

357
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,760
Babbitt.

358
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,880
Charlie Babbitt. 1961 Beechcrest Avenue.'

359
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,980
Charlie was astonished.

360
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,210
'How do you know that address?' he asked.

361
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,030
Dr Bruner spoke quietly.

362
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,350
'Because he's your brother,' he said.

363
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,210
'But I don't have a brother,' the astonished
Charlie said.

364
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:16,720
'I never had a brother.'

365
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,500
CHAPTER FOUR
Charlie and Dr Bruner walked through the flower

366
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,040
garden and talked together.

367
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,420
Susanna sat with Raymond, who was still writing
in his notebook.

368
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,640
'What can I tell you?'

369
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,800
the doctor asked.

370
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,300
'Where to begin?'

371
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:38,130
'What does he write in that notebook?'

372
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,380
'He writes down things that he thinks are
dangerous.

373
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,920
Things like bad weather reports.'

374
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,510
'Why does he do that?'

375
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:53,520
'I think he writes dangerous things down to
try and hide them.

376
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,940
Raymond sees danger everywhere.

377
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,110
Any change frightens him.

378
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:03,080
That is why he always does things in the same
way every day.'

379
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,059
'What do you mean?'

380
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:13,799
'Raymond always eats the same way, sleeps
the same way, talks the same way.

381
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,529
Everything.

382
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:17,309
But he's a person, your brother.

383
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:23,659
In some ways, a very intelligent person.'

384
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:29,559
Dr Bruner looked at Charlie for a second or
two, then he continued.

385
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:35,190
'Raymond cannot have relationships with other
people, and he cannot see the relationship

386
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,780
between things.

387
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:43,230
He talks to you, but he also talks to the
car and the television.

388
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,030
Everything is the same to him.

389
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:50,960
Doctors call this sort of person autistic.'

390
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,059
Charlie thought about this.

391
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,260
It was difficult to understand.

392
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,059
'And the most important thing is that Raymond
can't feel.

393
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:07,830
He cannot be happy or sad in the way that
we are happy or sad.'

394
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,360
Dr Bruner stopped speaking and looked at Charlie.

395
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,380
Charlie was biting his lip and looking over
at his brother.

396
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:24,090
'What Raymond did with you today... that was
very good,' Dr Bruner said softly.

397
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,330
'Very good.

398
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,570
For a stranger.'

399
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,440
Charlie shook his head and laughed.

400
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,290
'The world is strange,' he said.

401
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,210
'Three million dollars!

402
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,940
What's he going to spend it on?'

403
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,470
It was late afternoon.

404
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,860
Charlie was walking with Raymond.

405
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,039
Susanna waited in the car.

406
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,820
She thought that Charlie was saying goodbye
to his new brother.

407
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,649
Charlie walked quickly towards the Buick.

408
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:58,590
Raymond walked next to him.

409
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,340
'This is Daddy's car,' Raymond said.

410
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,570
'It was white.

411
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,460
But now this is a blue car.'

412
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,580
Charlie got into the Buick.

413
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,690
'Get in, Raymond,' he said.

414
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,380
Raymond got into the car.

415
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,179
'Charlie, wait a minute!'

416
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:18,179
Susanna said.

417
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:19,840
'Where are we taking him?'

418
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,210
'For a holiday,' Charlie said.

419
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:27,210
He started the car and they drove away.

420
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,470
Raymond looked back over his shoulder at the
house that they were leaving.

421
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:37,310
There was no expression on his face, but it
was very clear that he was anxious.

422
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,980
'Don't worry, Raymond,' Susanna told him,
'you're coming back.'

423
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:47,340
Charlie said nothing.

424
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,590
CHAPTER FIVE
They drove back to Cincinnati.

425
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:57,190
Raymond sat in the back of the Buick and watched
the road go by.

426
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:03,470
He said nothing to Charlie or Susanna, but
muttered strange things to himself.

427
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,460
They went to a hotel, and took two rooms.

428
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,500
Charlie showed Raymond his room.

429
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,480
'This is your room, Ray,' he said.

430
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,710
That was a big mistake.

431
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,240
Raymond looked around the room.

432
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,169
'This is not my room,' he said.

433
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:24,059
There was a frightened expression on his face.

434
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,390
'This is... is not my room.'

435
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,799
'Just for tonight,' Charlie said.

436
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,770
'Until we take you home,' Susanna said.

437
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,559
But Raymond was very upset now.

438
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,809
He was shaking his head from side to side
and muttering to himself.

439
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:48,690
'Of course, I'm going to be here a long time.

440
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,159
A very long time...

441
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:53,820
Of course, they moved my bed.'

442
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,350
'Sorry, Raymond,' Charlie said.

443
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,169
'You like the bed under the window.'

444
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:05,180
He started pushing the bed into its new place.

445
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,690
But Raymond was still unhappy.

446
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,240
He started muttering about books.

447
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,390
The only book in the room was a telephone
book for Cincinnati.

448
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,690
'Charlie, let's take him home,' Susanna said.

449
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,899
She liked Raymond, and she did not like to
see him upset.

450
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:26,860
'He's OK,' Charlie said.

451
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,540
'Do you like pizza, Ray?'

452
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:34,740
'Do you like pizza, Charlie Babbitt?'

453
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,299
Raymond knew the word 'pizza' because 'pizza'
was a Wallbrook word.

454
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:42,350
This calmed him a little.

455
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:47,330
'I'll ask the hotel to send a pizza up to
your room,' Charlie said.

456
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,110
'We like pizza, don't we, Ray?

457
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,110
We're brothers.'

458
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:56,610
'Charlie, he still doesn't look happy,' Susanna
said.

459
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,659
'I don't understand why you brought him here.

460
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:03,140
I think he wants to go back to Wallbrook.'

461
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:08,570
'Ray's fine,' Charlie said, 'all he needs
is some TV and some pizza.

462
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,450
What's on TV, Ray?'

463
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,659
Raymond looked at his watch.

464
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:17,730
'The Lucky Money Wheel,' he told the watch.

465
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,730
'Great.

466
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:23,080
Sit down, and you can watch it.'

467
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,120
Charlie turned on the television.

468
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,740
The Lucky Money Wheel came on.

469
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,470
'You've got your TV,' Charlie said.

470
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,419
'You've got a pizza coming.

471
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:35,700
Aren't things good, Ray?'

472
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,030
Charlie looked at Raymond and Raymond looked
at Charlie, but there was no expression on

473
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,230
his face.

474
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,800
'Do you ever smile, Ray?'

475
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Charlie asked.

476
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,799
'Do you ever smile?'

477
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,480
Raymond repeated.

478
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,890
There was still no expression on his face.

479
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:59,770
Raymond sat on his bed and watched television.

480
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,460
Charlie came in with a pizza.

481
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,039
Ray looked at the pizza and shook his head.

482
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,070
'What's the problem, Ray?'

483
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,130
Charlie asked.

484
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,530
Raymond wanted to eat the pizza the way that
he ate it at Wallbrook.

485
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:21,760
Charlie cut the pizza into tiny squares for
him, and put each square on a toothpick.

486
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,039
Charlie and Susanna went off to their room.

487
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,419
Raymond watched a film.

488
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:31,810
A man in the film told his son to turn the
television off.

489
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,159
Raymond got up and turned his television off.

490
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,640
Raymond continued to look at the television,
but now there was nothing to watch.

491
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,680
He heard the sound of another television in
Charlie and Susanna's room.

492
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,149
Raymond got up and went into their room.

493
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,630
Charlie and Susanna were in bed.

494
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:57,059
They did not see Raymond come into the room.

495
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:02,340
Raymond sat on the end of the bed and watched
the television.

496
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,559
Susanna saw him first.

497
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,070
'Charlie,' she said, in a quiet voice.

498
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,270
'Raymond is sitting at the end of the bed.'

499
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:18,450
Charlie sat up and saw that Raymond was watching
TV and eating pizza.

500
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,160
'Raymond, what are you doing in here?' he
shouted.

501
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,779
'Get out!'

502
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:29,760
Raymond got up and went back to his room.

503
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,630
Susanna looked at Charlie with an angry expression
on her face.

504
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,429
'Go and talk to him!'

505
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:36,429
she said.

506
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:37,970
'What for?'

507
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,970
Charlie asked.

508
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,909
'Because he's frightened,' Susanna said.

509
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:45,830
'He's never been away from Wallbrook before.

510
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,330
You've upset him!'

511
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,789
Charlie got angry.

512
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:52,900
'Raymond is not going back to Wallbrook,'
he said.

513
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,130
'He has to learn how to live in the real world.'

514
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,559
Susanna was astonished.

515
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,659
'What do you mean he's not going back to Wallbrook?'

516
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:07,510
Charlie looked away from her and bit his lip.

517
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:16,340
'I took Raymond,' he said quietly, 'and I'm
keeping him until I get my money.'

518
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,990
Susanna's eyes widened.

519
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,799
'What money?'

520
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,960
she asked.

521
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,940
'Dad left Ray some money.

522
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,940
A lot of money.'

523
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,040
Money!

524
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,309
Now Susanna was beginning to understand.

525
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:33,410
'How much money...

526
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,410
did...

527
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,850
your... father...

528
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,919
leave Raymond?'

529
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,049
she asked angrily.

530
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:42,880
Charlie looked away again.

531
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,049
'He left him his house and all his money,'
he said.

532
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:52,030
'Three million dollars.'

533
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,370
Susanna muttered some angry words in Italian
and jumped out of bed.

534
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:00,840
Then, she picked up her suitcase from the
floor and threw it open.

535
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,630
'What are you doing?'

536
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,929
Charlie asked.

537
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:07,560
'I'm leaving you, Charlie.'

538
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,450
She was coldly angry.

539
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,890
Now Charlie was astonished.

540
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,809
'Why?' he asked.

541
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:21,730
Susanna pushed her things into the suitcase
and pulled on her coat.

542
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:26,140
'Because you've kidnapped your brother for
money,' she shouted.

543
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,840
'I have not kidnapped him!

544
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,980
I just want my money.

545
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,400
What's wrong with that?'

546
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,179
'Everything!'

547
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,529
Susanna shouted.

548
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:41,870
She looked at Charlie for a second and shook
her head.

549
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:47,070
Then she picked up her suitcase and moved
towards the door.

550
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:51,390
When she got to the door, she turned and looked
at Charlie again.

551
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:56,750
'I did love you, Charlie,' she said sadly.

552
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:04,840
'But you are not the man that I thought you
were.'

553
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,130
CHAPTER SIX
The next morning Charlie took Raymond to have

554
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:14,530
breakfast in a cheap restaurant near their
hotel.

555
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,050
A pretty waitress came to their table.

556
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:21,140
'Good morning,' she said.

557
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,900
Raymond read the girl's name on the front
of her dress.

558
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,100
'Sally Dibbs,' he said suddenly.

559
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,040
'460192.'

560
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,650
Sally Dibbs was astonished.

561
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,790
'How do you know my telephone number?'

562
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,500
she asked.

563
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,620
Charlie was also astonished.

564
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,900
He looked at Sally and then at Raymond.

565
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:45,290
'How do you know her number, Raymond?' he
asked.

566
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,880
'The telephone book,' Raymond muttered.

567
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,230
'In the hotel.

568
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,610
The telephone book.'

569
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,180
'You read the telephone book!'

570
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,840
Charlie said.

571
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,830
He turned to the waitress and laughed.

572
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:04,080
'He remembers things,' he said.

573
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,370
Then he asked Raymond what he wanted for breakfast.

574
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,290
'This is Tuesday,' Raymond said.

575
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,960
'Breakfast is coffee and cakes.'

576
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,580
'That's fine,' Charlie said to the waitress.

577
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,410
'We'll have coffee and cakes.'

578
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,190
The waitress went to get the food.

579
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,400
Suddenly, an anxious expression came across
Raymond's face.

580
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,130
'Where are the toothpicks?'

581
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,820
he asked.

582
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:35,810
'We don't need toothpicks for cakes,' Charlie
said.

583
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,630
Raymond shook his head from side to side.

584
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,720
'Where are the toothpicks?'

585
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,850
he repeated.

586
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:44,640
'Where are the toothpicks?'

587
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,950
Charlie closed his eyes and counted to ten.

588
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,700
'All right, Raymond,' he said.

589
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,860
'I'll get you some toothpicks.

590
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,160
But I'm also going to make a phone call.

591
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,760
I want you to wait for me here.'

592
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,480
Charlie was on the phone.

593
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:07,300
'Dr Bruner, this is Charlie Babbitt.'

594
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,970
Dr Bruner was silent for a second.

595
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,620
Then he asked calmly, 'Where are you, son?'

596
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,010
'That's not important,' Charlie said.

597
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,260
'What is important is who I'm with.'

598
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,480
'You have to bring Raymond back, Mr Babbitt,'
the doctor said.

599
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,200
'Yes, I will,' Charlie said.

600
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,930
'When I get my one and a half million dollars,
sir.

601
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,290
All I want is my half of the money.'

602
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,460
'I can't do that, Mr Babbitt.

603
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,150
You know I can't.'

604
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,350
Charlie turned to watch Raymond.

605
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,770
He wasn't at their table!

606
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,910
Then he saw him: Raymond was looking all round
the restaurant.

607
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:54,870
He still did not have his toothpicks.

608
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,070
'Bring him back, Mr Babbitt,' Dr Bruner repeated.

609
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,990
'Bring him back now.'

610
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,830
'I have not kidnapped him,' Charlie said.

611
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,470
This was something which worried him.

612
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,170
Was Susanna right?

613
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,600
Was Charlie the Businessman now Charlie the
Criminal?

614
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,450
'I know you haven't kidnapped him,' Dr Bruner
said.

615
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,660
'Raymond is not a prisoner at Wallbrook.

616
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,930
He's always free to leave us.'

617
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,360
Charlie breathed more easily.

618
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,470
'But we know how to look after Raymond here,'
Dr Bruner continued.

619
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,070
'We know what he needs.

620
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:37,870
You do not know anything about Raymond, Mr
Babbitt.'

621
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:41,930
Raymond was still looking round the restaurant
for toothpicks.

622
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,580
Charlie watched him anxiously.

623
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:50,270
'I'm Raymond's brother,' Charlie said into
the phone, 'and my lawyer says I can get custody

624
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,270
of him.

625
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:55,910
If you want Raymond back, give me my money.'

626
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:01,160
'It's not your money, Mr Babbitt,' the doctor
was saying.

627
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,800
Charlie was not listening.

628
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,920
He was waving to the waitress.

629
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,350
'Toothpicks!' he shouted and he pointed at
Raymond.

630
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:12,040
'He wants toothpicks!'

631
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:18,790
'I cannot give you what you want, Mr Babbitt,'
Dr Bruner continued.

632
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:23,650
At last, Sally gave Raymond a full box of
toothpicks.

633
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:27,250
Raymond took the box back to their table.

634
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,890
Charlie was getting angry.

635
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:34,860
'Dr Bruner, you've made a big mistake!' he
said.

636
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,670
He put the phone down and walked over to where
Raymond was sitting.

637
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:42,200
'We're leaving, Raymond.'

638
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,340
Raymond stood up quickly and knocked the box
of toothpicks off the table.

639
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,770
The box fell to the floor and broke open.

640
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,970
The toothpicks went everywhere.

641
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,380
'Oh, Raymond!'

642
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,350
Charlie shouted.

643
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:59,650
But Raymond was looking down at the toothpicks
on the floor.

644
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:03,000
'Eighty-two,' he muttered.

645
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,500
'Eighty-two, eighty-two eighty-two.

646
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,010
Toothpicks.'

647
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,010
Charlie shook his head.

648
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:16,110
'Ray, there's a lot more than eighty-two toothpicks
down there.'

649
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,960
Raymond's expression didn't change.

650
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,210
'Eighty-two, eighty-two, eighty-two.

651
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:26,310
Of course that's two hundred and forty-six.

652
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,640
Toothpicks.'

653
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Charlie turned to Sally Dibbs.

654
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,650
'How many toothpicks in the box?' he asked.

655
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,540
The girl picked up the box and read the number
off it.

656
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,420
'Two hundred and fifty.'

657
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,900
Charlie smiled at his brother.

658
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,300
'That was very close, Raymond,' he said.

659
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,720
'Come on, let's go.

660
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,270
We're going to the airport.

661
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,250
I have to go back to Los Angeles.'

662
00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:00,170
As they walked to the door, Sally Dibbs called
after them.

663
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,690
'He was right!

664
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:08,290
There were two hundred and forty-six toothpicks
on the floor.

665
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:13,380
The other four are still in the box.'

666
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,870
At the airport Charlie telephoned his office.

667
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,750
The news was not good.

668
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:25,400
Both the bank and the customer for the Lamborghini
cars were still very unhappy.

669
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,140
Charlie needed to get back to Los Angeles
fast.

670
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,740
Charlie picked up his bag.

671
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,840
'OK, Raymond,' he said.

672
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,860
'We've got to move quickly.

673
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,970
Our plane leaves in six minutes.

674
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:42,080
Look, there it is out there.'

675
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,740
Charlie pointed out through the window at
the plane.

676
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,900
Raymond suddenly looked very anxious.

677
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,520
'Crash,' he muttered.

678
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,791
'That plane... crashed in August.

679
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:56,720
August 16, 1987.

680
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,390
One hundred and fifty-six people were...

681
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,600
They were all...'

682
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,780
'That was a different plane, Ray,' Charlie
said.

683
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,140
'This is a beautiful plane.

684
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,140
This one is safe.'

685
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,010
'Crash,' Raymond muttered.

686
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,840
'Crash and burn.'

687
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,600
Charlie did not know what to do.

688
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,390
They had only four minutes to catch the plane.

689
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,840
'We have to fly home, Ray,' he said.

690
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,540
'It's important.

691
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,390
What did you think we were doing here?

692
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,810
This is an airport.

693
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:32,340
This is where they keep the planes!

694
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,870
Come on!'

695
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,830
Charlie put his hand on Raymond's arm.

696
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,750
Raymond put his hand to his mouth and bit
it.

697
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:45,300
Then he screamed and began to shake all over.

698
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,170
For a second, Charlie just looked at his brother
with an astonished expression.

699
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,960
Then he saw that he had to calm Raymond down.

700
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,430
'It's OK, Raymond,' he said quickly.

701
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,060
'It's OK.

702
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,740
We'll drive to Los Angeles.

703
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,400
It will take three days, but we'll drive.

704
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,120
No planes.'

705
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,310
Raymond stopped screaming.

706
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:16,260
His body stopped shaking and slowly the anxious
expression left his face.

707
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,750
'I'm sorry, Raymond,' Charlie said softly.

708
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:23,180
'I'm sorry I upset you.'

709
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,160
Charlie turned and began walking out of the
airport.

710
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:33,330
A second later Raymond followed him.

711
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:39,070
CHAPTER SEVEN
Charlie drove all through the night.

712
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:41,360
He felt tired and anxious.

713
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,390
He needed to get back to Los Angeles fast
to try and save his business.

714
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:50,780
He was losing time that he did not have.

715
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,040
The next evening they stopped at a hotel.

716
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,630
Their room had a small bathroom.

717
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,650
Charlie went in to have a bath.

718
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:04,850
Raymond was cleaning his teeth, and his mouth
was full of toothpaste.

719
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,580
'Don't use so much toothpaste, Ray!'

720
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,060
Charlie said.

721
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,520
But Raymond continued cleaning his teeth.

722
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,930
Toothpaste came out of his mouth and dropped
on to his shirt.

723
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:19,040
'Will you stop that, Ray!'

724
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,140
Charlie said.

725
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,600
Raymond did not stop.

726
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,890
'You like it, Charlie Babbitt,' he muttered.

727
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:28,890
Charlie shook his head.

728
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:32,800
'No, I do not like it!' he shouted.

729
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,090
'You say, "Funny Rain Man... funny teeth."'

730
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,420
Suddenly Charlie stopped shouting.

731
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,500
Fumy Rain Man.

732
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,380
Rain Man!

733
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,510
That was the name of his secret friend when
he was a child.

734
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:54,910
'What did you say?' he asked.

735
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,500
'You can't say Raymond,' his brother said.

736
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,820
'You're a baby.

737
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,590
You say, "Rain Man".

738
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,300
"Funny Rain Man".'

739
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,320
Charlie sat down on the side of the bath.

740
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,790
He didn't know what to think.

741
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,940
He was finding it difficult to breathe.

742
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,380
'You...

743
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,000
you're the Rain Man?'

744
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,770
Charlie said finally.

745
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:26,300
Raymond put his hand in his pocket and pulled
out an envelope.

746
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:32,260
He opened the envelope and carefully took
out a small photograph.

747
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,650
Charlie took the photograph and looked at
it.

748
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:41,320
A young man of about eighteen was looking
at the camera, but not smiling.

749
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,430
He was holding a baby in his arms.

750
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:50,770
The baby was Charlie Babbitt, and the young
man was Raymond Babbitt.

751
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:55,700
'Daddy took the picture,' Raymond said.

752
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,160
Charlie looked at the photograph for a long
time.

753
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,490
He was astonished.

754
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,380
He and Raymond.

755
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,790
Charlie and Raymond.

756
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,080
Charlie and the Rain Man.

757
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,870
'And you... lived with us then?

758
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,210
When...

759
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:15,660
did you leave us?'

760
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,650
'It was Thursday,' Raymond said.

761
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,860
'Which Thursday, Ray?'

762
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,580
'It was snowing outside.

763
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:29,490
Maria stayed with you when Daddy took me to
my home.

764
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,880
January 21st, 1965.

765
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
On a Thursday.'

766
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:42,160
'That's when our mother died,' Charlie breathed
softly.

767
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,760
'Just after New Year.'

768
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,840
'And you had your coat.

769
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,350
And you waved to me from the window.

770
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,630
Goodbye, Rain Man.

771
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,120
Goodbye, Rain Man.

772
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,980
On a Thursday.'

773
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,190
Suddenly Charlie remembered deep into his
past.

774
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,520
He remembered the snow.

775
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,330
And waving to Rain Man.

776
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:10,360
And later crying.

777
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,990
Crying for Rain Man.

778
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:17,920
He wanted Rain Man, but Raymond didn't come.

779
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,360
He never came again.

780
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,720
'I sat with that coat,' Charlie said.

781
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,320
Now he remembered his brother's eighteen-year-old
face.

782
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,520
'And you sang to me.'

783
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,290
For a minute Raymond just looked at his brother.

784
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:44,700
Then, very softly, he began to sing a song
by The Beatles.

785
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:49,690
When Raymond finished singing, Charlie moved
closer to him.

786
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:54,220
Then he said, 'I remember I liked it.

787
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,190
When you sang to me.'

788
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,880
But Raymond was cleaning his teeth again.

789
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,700
Charlie picked up the photograph and muttered
something about how nice it was.

790
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,340
Then he put it down on the side of the bath
and turned on the water.

791
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,750
Suddenly Raymond began to scream.

792
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:19,230
'No, no, no, no!'

793
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:23,750
Charlie looked up and saw a terrible expression
on his brother's face.

794
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,350
Raymond was looking down at the water.

795
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:30,040
'It's BURNING him!' he screamed.

796
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,920
Quickly, Charlie turned off the water.

797
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,980
He remembered it all now.

798
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:41,690
His brother giving a two-year-old boy a bath
that was too hot.

799
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:45,230
Sanford Babbitt screaming, 'He's burning Charlie!

800
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,330
He's going to kill him!'

801
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,860
That was why his father sent Raymond to Wallbrook.

802
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:57,610
That was the end of the relationship between
Charlie and Rain Man.

803
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,920
And poor Raymond remembered it all.

804
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,210
'It's OK, Ray,' Charlie said softly to his
brother.

805
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,310
'It's OK, man.

806
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:10,320
I didn't bum.

807
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,460
I'm fine.'

808
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,030
It was late.

809
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:21,260
Raymond was sleeping on one of the two beds
in the hotel room.

810
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:25,460
Charlie lay on the other bed, and smoked a
cigarette.

811
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,110
He felt very tired and very sad.

812
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,820
He needed someone to love.

813
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,360
Someone who loved him.

814
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,560
He needed Susanna.

815
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,220
Charlie pulled the telephone towards him.

816
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,540
'Hello?'

817
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:49,870
'Hello, it's me, Charlie,' he said softly.

818
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,070
There was no answer.

819
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,070
'I...

820
00:48:52,070 --> 00:49:00,460
I just want to hear... that our relationship
is not...'

821
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,040
Charlie waited for Susanna to say something.

822
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:10,430
When she still did not speak, he said, 'I'm
frightened that it's finished between us.'

823
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:16,370
Finally, Susanna spoke.

824
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,580
'Don't ask me today, Charlie.

825
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,620
You won't like my answer.

826
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:22,620
Give me some time.'

827
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:27,840
'I'm... going to get custody of Ray.

828
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,940
I've talked to my lawyer and he says that
it is possible.

829
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:37,180
Firstly, I have to take Ray to see a special
doctor in Los Angeles.'

830
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:43,210
'Charlie, they won't give you custody of Ray,'
Susanna said.

831
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:47,720
'Dr Bruner has looked after him for more than
twenty years.

832
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,450
You've known him for four days.'

833
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,280
She didn't understand.

834
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,290
Nobody understood his relationship with Raymond.

835
00:49:57,290 --> 00:50:01,850
'Can I phone you when I get back to Los Angeles?'

836
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:08,930
Susanna didn't say yes, but she didn't say
no either.

837
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:14,490
CHAPTER EIGHT
The next morning Charlie heard more bad news

838
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:15,860
from the office.

839
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,780
They were taking the Lamborghinis away.

840
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,190
And Charlie had very little money left.

841
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:26,100
He was paying for everything with his American
Express card.

842
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,520
Charlie and Ray sat together in the hotel
restaurant.

843
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,970
At the next table there was a group of twenty
businessmen.

844
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:37,820
They were finishing their meal and asked the
waitress for the bill.

845
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,340
Raymond looked over at the table.

846
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:43,690
It was full of plates and cups and different
bits of food.

847
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:50,270
'Of course that bill is ninety-three dollars,
forty,' Raymond said.

848
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:51,470
Charlie laughed.

849
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:54,480
'How can you know that, Ray?'

850
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,620
'Ninety-three dollars, forty,' Raymond repeated.

851
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:02,090
The waitress returned with the bill.

852
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,760
Charlie read over her shoulder.

853
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,710
The bill was for ninety-three dollars, forty.

854
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:11,170
'How do you do it, Ray?'

855
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:12,580
Charlie asked.

856
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,370
'You can remember every number in a phone
book.

857
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:18,500
You can count two hundred toothpicks in under
a second.

858
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,390
You're like a computer.'

859
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:25,520
'Today is Thursday,' Raymond said.

860
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,800
'Thursday is coffee and cakes.

861
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,940
Same as Tuesday.'

862
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,200
Charlie looked at his brother.

863
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,480
Suddenly he had an idea.

864
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:41,210
A really great idea to end all his money problems.

865
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:44,250
'Raymond,' he asked his brother.

866
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:50,190
'Have you ever played cards?'

867
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:54,310
The next day they arrived in Las Vegas.

868
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:57,800
Charlie bought new suits for Raymond and himself.

869
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,690
He also bought Raymond a television the size
of a small clock.

870
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,560
Then he showed his brother how to play cards.

871
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,160
'Do you understand how to play now, Raymond?'

872
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,500
'I count cards,' said Raymond.

873
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,290
'Yes, but you must never say that.'

874
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:22,620
They went into the Golden Casino at four o'clock
in the afternoon.

875
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:26,010
They sat down at one of the card tables.

876
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:30,090
Five hours later, they got up from the card
table.

877
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:34,410
Charlie was very, very tired, but very happy.

878
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,620
He smiled at his brother.

879
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:42,690
'Raymond, you have won us ninety thousand
dollars.'

880
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:46,710
Raymond did not look up from the television
he now carried everywhere in his hand.

881
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:52,290
'Eighty-nine thousand, seven hundred and fifty-six
dollars,' he said.

882
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,810
And that was only in one visit!

883
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:59,590
'You're going to make us rich, Ray,' Charlie
said.

884
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:02,790
Raymond looked from his television to his
watch.

885
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:06,080
'Eight minutes to bed time,' he said.

886
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,700
'Eight minutes.'

887
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,730
Charlie smiled.

888
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,980
Raymond was still Raymond.

889
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:17,540
'Ray, we're going to stay in the best room
in the hotel here,' he said.

890
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,960
'Tomorrow we're going to come down and enjoy
ourselves.

891
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,450
Perhaps we'll find you a girl.'

892
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,820
Raymond was watching his television again.

893
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:30,340
'A girl,' he repeated.

894
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,670
'Yes, why not?'

895
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:38,440
But first Charlie needed a hot bath and a
good night's sleep.

896
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,350
And he needed to talk to Susanna again.

897
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:46,610
There was a knock on the door.

898
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,910
Charlie opened it.

899
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:50,780
'Susanna!'

900
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:54,630
Charlie put his arms round the girl that he
loved and kissed her.

901
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:57,000
'Ray, Susanna's here!'

902
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,390
'How did you know we were here?'

903
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,790
Charlie asked her.

904
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,210
Susanna spoke softly.

905
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:08,420
'They told me at the office,' she said.

906
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,770
'I'm sorry they took the cars away.'

907
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:15,010
'Oh, don't worry about that,' Charlie said
happily.

908
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:17,650
'We have some news to tell you.

909
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,980
Ray, tell Susanna what we've done.'

910
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,500
'We played cards,' Raymond said.

911
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,340
'I counted cards and we won money.'

912
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,810
'What?'

913
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:31,660
Susanna asked.

914
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:36,780
'It's a long story,' Charlie said, pulling
Susanna towards the bedroom.

915
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:42,010
'We'll talk about it later.'

916
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:44,190
Raymond knocked on the bedroom door.

917
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:48,420
'Come in,' Charlie called.

918
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,790
Raymond opened the door and stood there with
his little television in his hand.

919
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,720
'Six minutes until I find a girl.

920
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,590
To dance with,' Raymond said.

921
00:54:58,590 --> 00:54:59,860
'You said ten o'clock.'

922
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,840
'A girl?'

923
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,690
Susanna asked.

924
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:07,120
Charlie was getting out of bed.

925
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,600
'I taught him to dance.

926
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:14,210
Now, we're going to try to find him a girl
to dance with.'

927
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:21,810
'Five minutes,' Raymond said.

928
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:25,020
They walked round the Golden Casino for an
hour.

929
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,830
It was very difficult to find a girl for Raymond
to dance with.

930
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:32,790
To other people Raymond seemed strange.

931
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,660
Charlie pointed to one of the tables.

932
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,430
'This is where we played cards,' he said.

933
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:42,210
Suddenly, he felt a hand on his shoulder.

934
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:46,060
He turned around to see two big men in suits.

935
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,260
'Mr Babbitt?'

936
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,350
'Yes?'

937
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:55,930
'The boss wants to see you, please,' one of
the men said.

938
00:55:55,930 --> 00:56:01,140
He did not smile and Charlie guessed that
there was a problem.

939
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,310
Charlie turned to Susanna.

940
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:06,710
'Can you take Raymond back to our hotel room?'

941
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:12,450
'Of course,' Susanna said.

942
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:16,240
Susanna and Raymond took the lift back to
their room.

943
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:22,540
Raymond was watching a film with Fred Astaire
and Ginger Rogers on his little TV.

944
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:27,450
In the lift, Susanna looked at Raymond and
felt sad for him.

945
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:32,670
'Raymond, have you ever danced with a girl
before?'

946
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:34,460
she asked.

947
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,620
'I've danced with Charlie Babbitt,' Raymond
said.

948
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,150
'One time.

949
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:42,010
With Charlie Babbitt.'

950
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:45,690
He did not look up from his TV.

951
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:49,180
The music from the dancing below came into
the lift.

952
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,900
'I like this music,' Susanna said softly.

953
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:59,490
'Do you want to dance with me, Raymond.'

954
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,830
Susanna stopped the lift between two floors.

955
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:07,650
She moved closer to Raymond and took his hand
in hers.

956
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:11,660
They started to dance inside the lift.

957
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,860
Raymond watched his television over Susanna's
shoulder.

958
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,730
The song came to an end.

959
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,470
Susanna started the lift again.

960
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:26,790
'The other girls have missed a beautiful dance,'
she said.

961
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:29,420
Later Charlie came up to the room.

962
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,060
He looked very tired.

963
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,480
'We have to leave here tomorrow,' he said.

964
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,730
'They won't let us play cards here again.'

965
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,750
'Why not?'

966
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,680
Susanna asked.

967
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,940
'Because we won,' said Charlie, 'and they
don't like people winning.

968
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:53,040
I guess Raymond was too good for them.'

969
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,710
CHAPTER NINE
They left Las Vegas the next morning, and

970
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,790
drove back to Los Angeles.

971
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:05,540
Susanna sat next to Charlie in the front of
the Buick.

972
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:10,350
Raymond sat in the back of the car and watched
another film on his TV.

973
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:14,870
Sometimes he looked out at the desert they
were driving through.

974
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:18,150
Once Raymond drove the car for a few minutes.

975
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:21,330
The road was empty so there was no danger.

976
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:29,420
'I'm a... very good... driver,' Raymond said.

977
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:32,810
Susanna got out at her flat in Santa Monica.

978
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:37,000
Charlie and Raymond drove on to Charlie's
house in Los Angeles.

979
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,620
There was a letter waiting for Charlie.

980
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,590
It was from Dr Bruner.

981
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:48,970
'I'm staying here in Los Angeles, at the Hotel
California,' the letter said.

982
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:50,520
'Please come and see me.

983
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:54,440
I think we need to talk.'

984
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,820
That night Charlie went to see Dr Bruner at
his hotel.

985
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:05,410
'Mr Babbitt, I want to stop playing games,'
Dr Bruner said.

986
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:08,580
'My lawyer is talking to your lawyer.

987
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:14,100
He is explaining to him... the facts.

988
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,830
Raymond will see a special doctor on

989
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:17,250
Friday.

990
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:21,240
This doctor will decide who gets custody of
Raymond.

991
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,930
And you are going to lose.'

992
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:29,560
'I think that is for the doctor to decide,'
Charlie said.

993
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:35,430
'But I have helped Raymond more in one week
than you have in twenty years.'

994
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:37,970
'You think you have helped Raymond!'

995
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,540
Dr Bruner said.

996
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,350
'But Raymond is still autistic.

997
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:46,270
He will always be autistic!

998
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:51,780
Neither you nor I can change that fact.'

999
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,250
Charlie turned to go.

1000
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:58,430
'I'll see you on Friday, Dr Bruner.'

1001
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:01,200
'Don't you understand, Charlie?'

1002
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,200
Dr Bruner called.

1003
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:08,160
'Even if they give you custody of Raymond,
you will not get your father's money.

1004
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,500
I don't have to pay you anything.'

1005
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:17,780
'Goodbye, Dr Bruner,' Charlie said, walking
away.

1006
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,370
Dr Bruner called after him.

1007
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:26,820
'I'll give you two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars to have Raymond back now.'

1008
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:31,320
Charlie stopped walking and turned round to
face the doctor.

1009
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,490
He shook his head.

1010
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:41,690
'I don't want your money, Dr Bruner,' he said,
'I want my brother.'

1011
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,570
Friday came.

1012
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:47,250
Dr Marston sat at his desk.

1013
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:49,680
Next to him was Dr Bruner.

1014
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,680
In front of him were Charlie and Raymond.

1015
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,770
The two brothers were both wearing suits.

1016
01:00:55,770 --> 01:01:03,320
'There's no easy way to say this, Mr Babbitt,'
Dr Marston began.

1017
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,520
He did not need to continue.

1018
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,790
Charlie understood.

1019
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:11,620
'You're sending Raymond back to Wallbrook,'
he said.

1020
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:15,830
'They can look after him there,' Dr Marston
said.

1021
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:20,220
'They understand Raymond's problems.'

1022
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:24,260
'But Raymond has changed,' Charlie said angrily.

1023
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:29,890
'He has only been seven days with me and already
he is getting better.

1024
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:33,820
And you don't like that.'

1025
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:38,550
Dr Marston and Dr Bruner sat silently for
a minute.

1026
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:41,040
Then Dr Bruner turned to Raymond.

1027
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,270
'How was your holiday, Raymond?

1028
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:47,830
Tell me what you did.'

1029
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:50,580
Raymond held his little TV to his heart.

1030
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,250
'I played cards,' he said.

1031
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,640
'With Charlie Babbitt.

1032
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:59,010
And I drove Daddy's car.'

1033
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:01,050
Dr Bruner laughed.

1034
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,330
'You drove a car, Raymond?'

1035
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:08,100
'It was on a quiet road,' Charlie said.

1036
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:12,390
'And I danced with Susanna,' Raymond said.

1037
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:16,790
Even Charlie was surprised at this.

1038
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:21,910
Dr Bruner took a pen from his pocket and wrote
something down in a notebook.

1039
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:23,650
Then he turned to Raymond.

1040
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:28,580
'Do you want to stay with Charlie, Raymond?'
he asked.

1041
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:33,830
'I want to stay with Charlie Babbitt,' Raymond
said.

1042
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:36,960
'You see,' Charlie said.

1043
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,910
'Raymond wants to stay with me.'

1044
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:42,110
But Dr Bruner did not look at Charlie.

1045
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,790
He looked at Raymond.

1046
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:47,530
'Do you want to go back to Wallbrook, Raymond?'

1047
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:52,230
'I want to go back to Wallbrook.'

1048
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:55,230
Dr Bruner wrote again in his notebook.

1049
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:58,820
Dr Marston also wrote something down.

1050
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,560
'But what do you want to do, Raymond?'

1051
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,870
Dr Bruner asked again.

1052
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:05,760
'Do you want to stay with Charlie?

1053
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,100
Or do you want to go back to Wallbrook?'

1054
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,880
Raymond was now breathing very deeply.

1055
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:18,480
He shook his head from side to side, and moved
uncomfortably in his chair.

1056
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,230
'Wallbrook...

1057
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:22,310
Charlie Babbitt...

1058
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:23,910
Wallbrook...

1059
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,920
Charlie Babbitt,' he muttered.

1060
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,740
Charlie jumped out of his chair.

1061
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,600
'Stop asking him all these questions,' he
shouted.

1062
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,820
'You're upsetting him.'

1063
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:37,660
Now Dr Bruner looked at Charlie.

1064
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:44,790
'I'm showing you that Raymond is still autistic,
Charlie,' he said calmly.

1065
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:49,300
Charlie sat down and put his head in his hands.

1066
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:53,540
He saw that they would never give him custody
of Raymond.

1067
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,670
Perhaps they were right.

1068
01:03:55,670 --> 01:04:00,630
Perhaps they did know how to look after Raymond
at Wallbrook.

1069
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:05,280
But Charlie gave Raymond something they could
not give him at Wallbrook.

1070
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,750
Charlie gave Raymond love.

1071
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:13,110
And Raymond, in his way, gave Charlie love.

1072
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:16,150
All Charlie wanted was the best for Raymond.

1073
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:20,470
Charlie wasn't the loser, Raymond was the
winner.

1074
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:29,510
'Ray, they want you to go back to Wallbrook,'
Charlie said slowly to his brother.

1075
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:32,190
He looked up at the two doctors.

1076
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,840
'Can I visit him?'

1077
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,790
Dr Marston turned to Dr Bruner for an answer.

1078
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,890
'Of course,' Dr Bruner answered.

1079
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:43,100
'We would like you to.'

1080
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,740
Raymond took out his photograph.

1081
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:49,880
It was a lovely picture of the eighteen-year-old
Raymond and the two-year-old

1082
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,220
Charlie.

1083
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,430
Rain Man and Charlie.

1084
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:56,530
Brothers.

1085
01:04:56,530 --> 01:05:01,110
Raymond handed the photograph to Charlie.

1086
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,560
Charlie began to cry softly.

1087
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,270
'Are you all right, son?'

1088
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,850
Dr Bruner asked.

1089
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:12,500
Charlie looked up and smiled.

1090
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,320
Then he turned to his brother.

1091
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,970
'I'll come to see you, Ray,' he said.

1092
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:22,320
'And you can drive Dad's car when I visit.'

1093
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,480
'I'm a very good driver,' Raymond said.

1094
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:26,720
- THE END -
