1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,080
Time: the present Place: Sheffield, England

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,080
Everybody knew about the comet.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,320
It was in all the newspapers.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,560
When it finally passed close to the 
Earth, it lit up the sky for three nights.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,720
It was beautiful.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,080
People who were not usually interested in 
looking beyond their television screens  

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,880
took at least one look outside.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,840
Even people like Darren.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,120
Darren was looking in the bathroom 
mirror at the spots on his face.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,840
They were near his nose.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,400
His mum always said he got spots 
because he ate too many sweets.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,880
But he hated sweets.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,640
And he never ate chocolate.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,160
His mum loved chocolate and she never got spots.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,440
It wasn't fair.

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,080
Darren was just going to examine his 
biggest spot when his mum called out.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,840
'Darren! Darren, look at this!'

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,760
'Aw, Mum.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm busy!'

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,920
But Darren's mum refused to take no for an answer.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,240
She knew her thirteen-year-old 
son liked science fiction.

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,320
A bit of science fact would do him no harm.

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,320
This sort of thing didn't 
happen every day, after all.

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,120
They said that this comet was 
only going to pass the Earth once.

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,760
She didn't want Darren to miss it.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,200
'Darren Miller, come down right now!'

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,560
When Darren got downstairs, the 
door to the garden was open.

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,920
He could see both his parents outside.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,240
They were looking up, their 
faces lit by a gentle light.

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,120
He went out and stood next to them.

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,520
Then he, too, looked up.

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,680
It was, indeed, a lovely thing to see.

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,880
Darren was pleased his mum had called him.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,320
The sky was full of beautiful, coloured light.

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,240
It made Darren think of Christmas lights and all 
the bright colours he loved when he was younger.

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,840
It was so beautiful that he 
almost forgot about his spots.

37
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,160
The next day all of the newspapers were full 
of pictures and stories about the comet.

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,920
Some of the newspapers were 
quite excited about it,  

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,840
because the comet had passed 
very close to the Earth.

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,640
'Comet nearly hits Earth!' said 
one headline in a newspaper.

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,480
'Earth escapes comet!' said another.

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,840
Most of the newspaper reports also 
mentioned the beauty of the comet.

43
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,640
They all said how lucky we were 
to see such a wonderful thing.

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,440
Of course, there were the usual pessimists  

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,320
who said that the comet would put 
something nasty into the air we breathe.

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Others said the comet was a sign 
that the end of the Earth was coming.

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,640
However, most people took 
no notice of these warnings.

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,360
Life went on as usual.

49
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,040
Life for Darren meant getting ready 
for school again after the holidays.

50
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,240
Comets were nice but now he had more 
important things to think about.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,000
He had to make himself look 
good for the beautiful Vanessa.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,640
Darrens school was just an ordinary school 
in the city of Sheffield in England.

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,080
It was no better than any 
other school in Sheffield.

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,880
But it did have Vanessa.

55
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,640
Vanessa was a brown-haired, brown-eyed 
girl in the same year as Darren.

56
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
She had smiled at Darren once.

57
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,480
He remembered it well.

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,240
It had happened in the last 
week before the holidays.

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,240
He had let her go in front of 
him in the queue for lunch.

60
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,760
She hadn't said 'thank you,' but 
she had given him a little smile.

61
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,960
It had showed her perfect white teeth.

62
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,880
He had been too nervous to speak to her.

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,040
He just couldn't do it.

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,160
It would be easier, he felt, to grow 
wings and fly up to the ceiling.

65
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,960
This time he would be ready.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,080
He would put on lots of deodorant 
to make himself smell nice.

67
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,360
He wanted to have another look at his 
spots and, just maybe, have a shave.

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,920
The night before  

69
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,840
he had felt something above his mouth that 
might be the first hairs of a moustache.

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,320
He made sure he got to the bathroom 
before everyone else that morning.

71
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,600
He wanted to have a close look at those spots...

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,080
and his new moustache.

73
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,320
'Darren, will you be in there for 
a long time?' It was Darren's mum.

74
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,200
'Your father wants to use the bathroom.'

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,840
Darren knew his dad always 
spent ages in the bathroom.

76
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,320
Well, his dad could wait today, for a change.

77
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,200
'I'll be out soon, Mum,' said Darren.

78
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,200
But he was lying.

79
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,960
He wanted to look good and smell good.

80
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,040
It could take a long time.

81
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,840
His new deodorant smelled very good this morning.

82
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,400
He suddenly noticed all the 
different smells that went into it.

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,640
There were flowers, spices - lots of 
things he had never smelled before.

84
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,680
His nose felt a bit wet too.

85
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,280
Was he getting a cold? Probably not, 
if he could smell things so well.

86
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,600
Darren walked over to the 
mirror and looked at his face.

87
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,880
His face looked worse than ever!

88
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,240
His nose was wet and shiny.

89
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,920
It was moving a lot, like an animal's nose.

90
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,440
It looked like a rabbit smelling its breakfast.

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,720
But this wasn't the most shocking thing.

92
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,880
His top lip had long, thick hairs on it.

93
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,000
They were like the hairs on an animal's nose.

94
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,120
They were like the whiskers of a rabbit!

95
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,840
Darren screamed.

96
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,520
Time: the present Place: Singapore

97
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,480
Julie Ong had been fourteen for three weeks.

98
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,840
A lot of her friends were fourteen too.

99
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,240
They all agreed that a young 
woman should watch her weight.

100
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,120
It was especially important 
not to eat sweets and cakes.

101
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,840
Julie hadn't eaten a cake or a piece 
of chocolate since her birthday.

102
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,120
But there were still no signs that her 
parents saw Julie as a young woman.

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,480
To them, she was still a child.

104
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,080
Then there was the strange thing with the comet.

105
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,400
Everybody was talking about it.

106
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,720
Julies English teacher gave 
her class homework about it.

107
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,400
They had to describe the comet in a poem.

108
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:19,360
It was so unfair! The comet had been quite 
beautiful, but writing about it was no fun at all.

109
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,080
Julie decided to take a break 
from her Sunday morning homework.

110
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,840
Instead of writing she would comb 
her long black hair in the mirror.

111
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,280
It was more interesting than 
writing a poem, at least.

112
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,960
Her parents wouldn't notice 
that she was wasting time.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,840
She could hear them at the other end 
of the house talking about the comet.

114
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,240
They weren't talking loudly, 
but she could still hear them.

115
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,800
Her hearing wasn't normally that good.

116
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,720
It was very odd.

117
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,400
Julie picked up her hairbrush - her favourite 
pink one - and walked towards her bedroom mirror.

118
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,320
But when she looked at herself, she 
immediately noticed something strange.

119
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,680
There were two things rising 
up and out from her hair.

120
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,800
They were on both sides of her head.

121
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,760
Julie pushed back her hair and saw 
that the two things were her ears.

122
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,560
They were now pointed at the top, like an 
animal's ears, and they were bigger too.

123
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,480
Much bigger.

124
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
Julie fainted.

125
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,800
Darrens new whiskers grew even 
longer over the next week.

126
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,680
His nose became much, much 
better at smelling things too.

127
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,640
He could smell almost anything 
from a long distance away now.

128
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,280
His dad had his own smell, so had his mum.

129
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,840
Everybody had their own smell.

130
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,280
Having a good nose was useful and Darren liked it.

131
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,560
He liked his whiskers too, and he 
couldn't really shave them off.

132
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,840
It would hurt, he was sure, if he tried.

133
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,120
Anyway, he was getting used to them.

134
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,480
In Singapore, Julie Ong discovered that 
her hearing had become extremely good.

135
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,840
She could hear almost everything.

136
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,720
Darren didn't know it yet, but the beautiful 
Vanessa had now grown long teeth like a cat's.

137
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,880
She had whiskers too.

138
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,840
And suddenly she seemed to 
enjoy eating a lot of fish.

139
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,640
Darren, Julie and Vanessa were not alone.

140
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,760
Sudden changes were happening all over the world.

141
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,840
Many young people between the 
ages of twelve and eighteen  

142
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,680
had developed the special 
strength of some kind of animal.

143
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,280
Sometimes it wasn't immediately obvious - like 
having the fantastic eyesight of a hunting bird.

144
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,880
But often the changes were obvious.

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Some had grown long tails and they 
could hold on to things with them.

146
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,320
Some had webbed skin on their hands 
and feet so that they could swim fast.

147
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,600
Some had the strength of a bull; 
others could run as fast as a horse.

148
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,440
They all looked human still, but 
in some way they had changed.

149
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,160
Of course, adults everywhere 
were extremely worried.

150
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,280
Why had their children changed? 
What had produced the changes?  

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,240
What could they do to help their children?

152
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,920
Darren discovered that his amazing 
nose had many advantages too.

153
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,240
He found that he could tell 
what mood people were in  

154
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,160
just by their smell - even if 
they were trying to hide it.

155
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,920
That was useful.

156
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,600
This new sense of smell was 
useful in other ways too.

157
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,120
If he lost something, he could 
always find it by using his nose.

158
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,400
He helped his mum buy the freshest 
and tastiest food in the supermarket.

159
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,800
He now used deodorant which 
didn't have a strong smell.

160
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,880
His new nose didn't like strong smells any more.

161
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,840
'You'd better not get too 
used to it,' said his dad.

162
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,520
'Some day soon we'll be able to 
get you back the way you were.'

163
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,200
'Maybe, Dad,' Darren said.

164
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,640
'But what if I don't want to 
go back to the way I was?'

165
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Darrens father didn't say anything.

166
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,000
Like many other parents, he didn't understand 
how his son could like the changes.

167
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,920
He wanted the old Darren back - the Darren without 
the whiskers and the amazing sense of smell.

168
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,560
And why had some young people changed  

169
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,680
while others hadn't? That was the question 
every adult in the world was asking.

170
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,480
Some adults blamed the children 
themselves for the changes.

171
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,960
They said they watched too much TV or ate the 
wrong things or didn't behave in the right way.

172
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Most people blamed the comet.

173
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,400
'Comet causes horrible teenage changes!'  

174
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,720
was the kind of headline found on 
the front page of many newspapers.

175
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,200
They all had similar stories.

176
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,960
Everybody was saying that it must have 
been the comet - what else could it have  

177
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:42,000
been? The comet had, in some strange way, 
affected the bodies of some teenagers.

178
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,080
'I don't think the changes are 
horrible!' said Julie to her friends.

179
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,840
'I think my new hearing is very useful.

180
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,440
I think my ears are rather beautiful too!'

181
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Some of Julie's friends agreed with her.

182
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,480
'I like my new wings,' said one.

183
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,480
'I can change colour like a chameleon 
- isn't that cool?' said another.

184
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,560
Teenagers everywhere were comparing their changes.

185
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,840
Some were stronger, others were 
faster, others could jump higher.

186
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,240
But no matter what changes 
happened, they were still teenagers.

187
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,560
But then something strange happened.

188
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,560
Some teenagers began to return to normal.

189
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,200
Some eventually lost all sign of their changes 
and went back to what they had been before.

190
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,880
But why?

191
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,200
The answer came almost by accident.

192
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,800
A teen called Danny was given 
a job in an advertisement.

193
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,320
Danny had wings and he could fly.

194
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,840
In the advertisement, Danny had to fly over a 
childrens party and give out chocolate biscuits.

195
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,240
Danny hated chocolate biscuits, but he 
had to eat some during the advertisement.

196
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,760
It was after he ate his second biscuit 
that something started happening.

197
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,120
His wings started to get smaller.

198
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,640
Soon they disappeared completely.

199
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,040
He couldn't fly any more.

200
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,120
Danny was a 'normal' teenager again.

201
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,840
Why had it happened?

202
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,080
It was the chocolate.

203
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,520
It had to be.

204
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Scientists tested the effect of 
chocolate on other teenagers.

205
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,720
They discovered that if the teenagers 
ate a few things with chocolate in them,  

206
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,160
they went back to normal.

207
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,280
The world now knew why some children 
hadn't been affected by the comet.

208
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,680
The mystery was solved.

209
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,120
The comet had only changed 
teenagers who didn't eat chocolate!

210
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,200
'I don't like chocolate, you know 
that,' Darren told his parents.

211
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,200
'I've never liked it.'

212
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,280
'But all you have to do is eat a bit 
and you'll go back to normal!' said Dad.

213
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,320
'You want to be normal again, don't you, Darren?'

214
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,760
Darren thought about Vanessa.

215
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,640
He liked her new cat looks.

216
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,560
Vanessa had found Darrens changes attractive too.

217
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,520
She had spoken to him quite a lot lately.

218
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,680
'If you mean do I want to be like 
most of my friends, then yes.

219
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,400
But some of my friends have 
changed and we like the changes.

220
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,080
Why should I want to go back? 
Anyway, I hate chocolate.'

221
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,560
His parents couldn't make him change his mind.

222
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,600
Maybe if his friends agreed to 
change back, Darren would too.

223
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,520
But that wasn't as easy as it seemed.

224
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,120
A lot of teenagers felt the same way as Darren.

225
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,240
Some adults accepted their new teenagers 
because the changes were useful in daily life.

226
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,120
If you were faster and stronger, 
for example, you could work better.

227
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,840
But most adults expected that their teenagers 
would want to return to how they had been before.

228
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,600
Many of them did.

229
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,440
But a lot of teenagers simply 
didn't care what the adults wanted.

230
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,400
They refused to eat the chocolate.

231
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
In Singapore, Julie Ong 
finally ate some chocolate.

232
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,840
Soon, her beautiful big ears were gone.

233
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,200
She often remembered them and was sad.

234
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,560
In Sheffield, Darren Miller was using his nose  

235
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,960
to enjoy the sweet smell of the 
carrots growing in Vanessa's garden.

236
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,480
Vanessa watched him happily as she 
ate a fish on top of the garden wall.
