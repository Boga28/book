CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,160
A Departure and a Romantic Adventure

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,120
It was the last day of term 
at Miss Pinkerton's academy.  

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,920
Miss Pinkerton was giving final 
instructions to her sister, Miss Jemima.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,640
'Is everything ready for Miss Sedley?'  

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
she asked grandly. 'She will take 
the dictionary with her, of course.'

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,280
Miss Pinkerton's academy was one of 
the finest schools for young ladies.  

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,560
The academy had been visited by the great 
Dr Samuel Johnson. He had also mentioned  

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,360
it in a poem. Miss Pinkerton could never 
resist mentioning the great man's name,  

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,800
and she gave her pupils a copy of his 
dictionary when they left the school.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,920
'What about Becky Sharp?' Miss Jemima now asked. 
'Shall I give her a copy of the dictionary, too?'

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,040
'Becky Sharp!' Miss Pinkerton exclaimed 
angrily. 'We won't waste the dictionary on her.'

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,600
Becky Sharp was an orphan. Her mother, a 
Frenchwoman, had died some years previously.  

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,800
She had taught Becky French. Her father 
had been the school's art teacher.  

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,280
He was a talented man, but very 
fond of wild company and drinking.  

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,600
He had begged Miss Pinkerton to take on Becky as 
an 'articled pupil' at the school before he died.

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,160
Becky Sharp was a good-looking, intelligent 
girl. She was small and slender, and she had  

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,440
sandy hair. Miss Pinkerton had realised how 
useful she could be because she knew French  

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,520
and could play music. Becky Sharp despised Miss 
Pinkerton and the moral atmosphere of the academy.

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,840
The relationship between Miss Pinkerton and 
Becky Sharp grew worse and worse. Both of  

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,360
them were glad when the girl obtained a 
post as governess to Sir Pitt Crawley.

22
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,840
Amelia Sedley was the daughter of a rich London 
stockbroker. She was a pretty girl, and she had  

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,160
healthy red cheeks and a warm smile. Everyone 
loved her because she was patient and kind.  

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,360
Amelia had asked Becky to stay at her family's 
house for a week when they left school.

25
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,480
Soon the two girls had said goodbye to 
the headmistress, and they went out to  

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,560
the carriage. Just as the carriage began 
to move, Miss Jemima ran up to the window.

27
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,560
'Stop!' she cried out excitedly. She 
pushed two parcels through the window.

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,240
'Some sandwiches, my dears,' she told 
the two girls. 'And a book for you,  

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,760
Becky,' she went on. 'Johnson's Dictionary, 
you know. You can't leave without that.'

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
The good woman went back into the garden.  

31
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,120
She had defied her sister for once, but 
she was sure she had done the right thing.

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,280
The carriage drove off. Miss Jemima was 
horrified to see Becky Sharp lean out of  

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,720
the window and throw the precious 
dictionary back into the garden.

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Mr and Mrs Sedley were delighted 
to have their daughter back home,  

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,400
and they gave a kind welcome 
to her friend Becky as well.  

36
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Amelia's older brother, Jos, was also at home. 
He had recently returned on leave from India,  

37
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,840
where he had an important and lucrative post 
in the East India Company's Civil Service.

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,640
Jos Sedley had lived a very 
isolated life in India,  

39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,120
and he was terribly shy of women. 
He was also extremely vain,  

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,320
and dressed in the latest fashion. This made him 
look rather ridiculous, as he was very overweight.

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,000
It did not take long for Becky Sharp 
to understand Jos, and a certain idea  

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,720
began to take shape in her mind. She hated 
the prospect of working as a governess.

43
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,760
That night at dinner Becky Sharp 
paid particular attention to Jos.  

44
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,920
He was flattered by the looks she 
gave him, and blushed frequently.  

45
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,360
Mrs Sedley had had a curry prepared for 
her son, and Becky was offered some.

46
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,800
'I must try some,' she said. 'I'm sure 
it's very good if it comes from India.'

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,680
Old Mr Sedley smiled quietly. He understood 
her sudden enthusiasm for India and curry.

48
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,360
'Is it good?' he asked her softly.

49
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
'Excellent!' Becky gasped.

50
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,840
'Try a chilli with it,' Jos suggested.

51
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,680
'A chilli?' Becky said faintly. The word 'chilli' 
sounded so cool that she took a whole one. It was  

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,640
hotter than the curry. In a moment she was 
red in the face - she could hardly breathe.

53
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,840
'Water!' she cried. 'Water, for heaven's sake!'

54
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,240
Mr Sedley laughed aloud. Even Jos laughed.

55
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,280
Becky was furious, but she 
took the joke in good spirits.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,080
Mr Sedley took his son aside after 
dinner, and gave him a little advice.

57
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,480
'That girl's determined to marry you,' he said.

58
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,880
'Nonsense!' Jos replied, 
but he was very flattered.

59
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,400
Jos began to think about Becky more and more. Soon 
he was convinced that he was in love with her. His  

60
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,200
behaviour towards her became stranger and stranger 
as he struggled against his shyness. Becky thought  

61
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,480
he was in love. Perhaps he might ask her to 
marry him. The future looked bright for her.

62
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,840
There were two other frequent visitors to the 
Sedley household during Becky Sharp's stay there.  

63
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,360
They were two young army officers, 
William Dobbin and George Osborne.

64
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,560
One evening all the young people decided 
to go to Vauxhall Gardens together.  

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,840
Amelia was very excited because she was in love 
with George Osborne. He was a good-looking young  

66
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,560
man, and he was Mr Sedley's godson. William Dobbin 
and George had been to the same school, and they  

67
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,560
were close friends. Dobbin was not as good-looking 
as his friend - he was tall and very shy.

68
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,480
George and Amelia had known each 
other since they were children.  

69
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,880
Their families expected them to marry.

70
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,600
Becky was sure that Jos wanted to ask her to 
marry him. She walked by his side, giving him  

71
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,880
every encouragement she could. Jos himself was 
sure that he wanted to ask her to marry him,  

72
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,720
but he did not know how to approach the issue.

73
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,600
At last the party decided to eat something at the 
restaurant in the Vauxhall Gardens. Jos ordered a  

74
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,280
magnificent meal and the best champagne. 
He ate and drank more than anyone else.  

75
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,480
Then he ordered a bowl of punch. It was 
the custom at Vauxhall to drink punch.

76
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,760
It was the punch that was responsible 
for the whole of this story.  

77
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,080
If Jos Sedley had not ordered 
it, and then drunk most of it,  

78
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,760
he would have proposed to Becky Sharp, and that 
would have been the end of the story. As it was,  

79
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,360
the more he drank, the more cheerful he became. 
He began to sing, and this made people laugh.

80
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
George Osborne was embarrassed.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,840
'I think we should leave,' he told 
the girls. They stood up to go.

82
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,720
'Stop, my dearest diddle-diddle-darling!' Jos 
cried out to Becky. He seized hold of her waist.  

83
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Becky could not free herself, and Jos held 
on to her tightly and resumed his song.

84
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,360
Dobbin succeeded in freeing the unfortunate Becky.  

85
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,040
He took Jos back to his lodgings, and 
George Osborne took the girls back home.

86
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,280
Becky and Amelia were sure 
that the moment had come  

87
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,520
for Jos to propose to Becky, after 
his behaviour the night before!

88
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,440
Jos, meanwhile, woke with a terrible 
headache. He did not remember everything  

89
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,960
that had happened the night before, 
but he was terribly ashamed of himself.  

90
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,960
He did not have the courage to see Becky 
again. He wrote a note to Amelia saying  

91
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,520
that he was leaving London, and asking her 
to apologise to Becky for his behaviour.

92
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,040
It was the end of Becky's hopes of marriage.  

93
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,840
She knew now that she had to take up the post of 
governess with Sir Pitt Crawley and his family.

94
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,400
CHAPTER TWO

95
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
The Crawley Family

96
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,280
Becky's new employer was Sir Pitt Crawley. Sir 
Pitt Crawley had been married twice, and he  

97
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,000
had two grown-up sons from his first marriage - 
Pitt and Rawdon Crawley. After the death of his  

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,320
first wife Sir Pitt had married again, this time 
choosing an ironmonger's daughter. They had two  

99
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,760
daughters. Sir Pitt had advertised for a governess 
to help in the education of these two children.

100
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,080
Becky Sharp was young enough to have a romantic 
idea of what a baronet's establishment might  

101
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,880
be like. She was very shocked, therefore, 
to discover that Sir Pitt Crawley seemed  

102
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:37,200
hardly a gentleman at all. He was an elderly 
man who dressed badly and drank too much.  

103
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,600
He was also mean about money, and 
preferred to spend his time eating  

104
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,360
and drinking with the butler, rather 
than entertaining ladies and gentlemen.

105
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,040
Sir Pitt Crawley's country residence, 
Queen's Crawley, was a large house,  

106
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,480
but it was in poor condition.

107
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,720
Becky soon realised that the most important person 
in the house, after Sir Pitt Crawley himself,  

108
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,200
was the baronet's older son, Pitt. Unlike 
his father, he was rather a severe man  

109
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,680
with very strong religious opinions. It was clear 
that the father and son did not get along well.

110
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,000
It was also clear that Sir Pitt's wife, the 
ironmonger's daughter, wielded no power in  

111
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,240
the house at all. Lady Crawley had been a lovely 
young girl before she married Sir Pitt Crawley.  

112
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,120
She had given up a decent young man who loved 
her for the happiness of becoming Lady Crawley.  

113
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,800
Vanity Fair, indeed! Her beauty faded, and 
Sir Pitt became bored with her. The poor  

114
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,560
woman was despised by all. The only person who 
showed the slightest respect for her was the  

115
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,840
baronet's older son, Pitt. He behaved with a 
cold, formal correctness to her at all times.

116
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,160
Sir Pitt Crawley's brother, Bute, was the 
local parson. He and his family lived in  

117
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,240
the village rectory. The relationship between 
the two brothers was not particularly good.  

118
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,880
They had quarrelled about money in the past, 
and they continued to plot against each other.  

119
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,640
Their plots centred around Sir Pitt's 
unmarried half-sister, Miss Crawley.

120
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,000
Miss Crawley was a very rich,  

121
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,840
selfish old woman. She did not like Pitt 
Crawley because of his piety. She wanted  

122
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,640
to leave half of her money to Bute Crawley, and 
the other half to Sir Pitt's second son, Rawdon.

123
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,320
Becky rapidly decided on the most useful 
strategy to follow at Queen's Crawley.  

124
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,440
She wanted to keep everyone happy with least 
effort to herself. She won over the two daughters  

125
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,280
by letting them educate themselves rather 
than giving them difficult lessons to follow.

126
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,680
Sir Pitt Crawley was involved in a large number 
of lawsuits with different people, and Becky soon  

127
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,920
learned all the details of these. She ordered his 
papers for him, and helped prepare his accounts.  

128
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,720
She also helped him with the management of 
the estate, and was very useful in every way.

129
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,720
With his older son, Pitt, Becky took 
a different approach. She listened to  

130
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,360
his religious opinions very seriously, and 
encouraged his political ambitions as well.

131
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,320
The wealthy Miss Crawley soon arrived at Queen's 
Crawley, where everyone made a great fuss of her.  

132
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,840
Becky wrote to Amelia, describing how Sir Pitt 
provided the finest food and wines for her,  

133
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,480
and how the family at the rectory also did 
their best to entertain the selfish old lady.  

134
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,360
Sir Pitt's younger son,

135
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,280
Rawdon Crawley, also came to stay at 
Queen's Crawley to be near his aunt.  

136
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,240
Becky told Amelia that the young 
army officer was very good-looking  

137
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,800
and had even asked her to dance 
with him at a country ball.

138
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,880
Miss Crawley knew perfectly well that 
her relatives were waiting for her to die  

139
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,680
so that they could inherit her fortune. She was a 
shallow, pleasure-loving woman, and she only had  

140
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,400
time for the dashing young army officer, Rawdon 
Crawley. She regarded Pitt Crawley as a bore,  

141
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,840
and was frightened of his religion and morality. 
She thought Bute and his wife were dull as well.

142
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,480
It was not long before Becky Sharp had 
become a favourite with the old lady.  

143
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,520
Becky amused her by imitating the guests 
who were invited to dine at Queen's Crawley.  

144
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,320
Miss Crawley insisted that the governess 
sit beside her and Rawdon at dinner.

145
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:32,000
'I don't care about birth and social position,' 
she said to Becky. 'Look at my brother Pitt,  

146
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,240
look at Bute at the parsonage. None of 
them have got your intelligence, my dear.  

147
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
They're not even the equals of 
my poor old companion Briggs.  

148
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,520
No, what I care for is wit and 
breeding - and you've got both!'

149
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,240
She even confided in Becky 
about her hopes for Rawdon.

150
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,480
'I admired Nelson because he didn't care 
what people thought. He ran away with a  

151
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,640
beautiful woman. I hope some great 
man runs away with you, my dear!'  

152
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:11,280
she went on. 'I hope Rawdon runs away 
with a girl,' she added dreamily.

153
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,120
'A rich one or a poor one?' Becky asked.

154
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,880
'A rich one, of course,' Miss Crawley 
replied with a smile. 'Poor Rawdon  

155
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,640
hasn't got any money except what I give him.'

156
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,760
'Is he terribly clever?' Becky asked.

157
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,320
'Clever!' the old lady laughed. 
'Rawdon hasn't got an idea  

158
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,760
in his head. But I want him to succeed 
- he's so delightfully wicked!'

159
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,640
Although Becky told Amelia in her 
letter that Rawdon had danced with her,  

160
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,280
she did not tell her friend everything about 
the young army officer's behaviour towards her.  

161
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,320
One evening, when Becky was playing the piano, 
Rawdon stood close to her, bending over the music.  

162
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,640
He had even written her a note while 
she was singing after dinner once,  

163
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,640
and hidden it in her music book. Becky picked 
up the note and dropped it into the fire.

164
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,800
'What's that, my dear?' 
Miss Crawley asked sleepily.

165
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,960
'A false note,' Becky replied with a little smile.

166
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,600
Rawdon blushed furiously.

167
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,160
CHAPTER THREE

168
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,840
Young Lovers

169
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,240
He must now leave the good people 
enjoying themselves at Queen's Crawley,  

170
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,520
and return to London to find 
out what is happening to Amelia.

171
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,320
The ladies in Amelia's social circle agreed 
that she was very good-natured but dull.  

172
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,080
The Misses Osbornes and Dobbins patronised 
the poor girl terribly, and Amelia was very  

173
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,800
shy in their company. 'What does George see 
in her?' they asked each other in wonder.

174
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,600
George Osborne himself became used to 
the idea that he was making an enormous  

175
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,040
sacrifice in marrying Amelia. He continued 
to visit the Sedley household, of course,  

176
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,960
but days went by when he ignored Amelia. 
She suffered, but she told no one about her  

177
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,840
suffering. Only George's friend Dobbin 
realised that the girl was unhappy.

178
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,640
Meanwhile great events were taking place in 
Europe. Napoleon's army was defeated by the  

179
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,000
allies, and the emperor was forced to abdicate 
and take up residence on the island of Elba.  

180
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,760
The financial markets of the world were 
disturbed. Mr Sedley suffered heavy losses  

181
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,680
in his investments on the stock exchange.

182
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,760
One day George Osborne visited Amelia, 
and invited her to dine with his family  

183
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,120
at Russell Square that evening. Amelia 
was delighted, and accepted happily.

184
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,400
Amelia arrived early at the house, 
and was talking with George's sisters  

185
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:58,320
when Mr Osborne came home. Mr Osborne 
seemed surprised to see her there.

186
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,000
'George is home today, Papa,' one of the sisters 
explained. 'He'll be coming in to dinner soon.'

187
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,480
'Will he indeed?'  

188
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,200
Mr Osborne said crossly. 'He'd better come 
in on time. I won't hold dinner for him.'

189
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,280
Mr Osborne sat down gloomily. When the 
clock struck the usual time for dinner,  

190
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,400
he rang for the butler.

191
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,080
'Dinner!' he ordered angrily.

192
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,040
'Mr George isn't in yet,' the man replied.

193
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,800
'Damn Mr George, sir. I'm the master here!' 
Mr Osborne commented angrily. 'Dinner, I say!'

194
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,840
The ladies looked at each other in fright.

195
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,200
Dinner was a silent affair. 
Mr Osborne said nothing,  

196
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,560
and no one else knew how to make conversation. 
George arrived halfway through the meal, and  

197
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,320
did not seem to notice his father's bad humour. 
He talked amusingly to Amelia and his sisters.

198
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,320
At last the ladies retired to the drawing room, 
leaving Mr Osborne and George to their wine.  

199
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,840
The older man was still bad-tempered. 
George did his best to cheer him up.  

200
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,600
The real reason for his visit 
was that he had run out of money.  

201
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,480
He was hoping for some money from 
his father. At last his father spoke.

202
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,400
'How are you and Amelia getting on?' he asked.

203
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,720
'Anyone can see that she loves 
me, sir,' George replied proudly.

204
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,040
'And you?' his father asked 
sharply, 'What about you, my boy?'

205
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,120
George laughed easily.

206
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
'Didn't you tell me to marry Amelia,  

207
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,520
sir?' he joked. 'You and Mr 
Sedley arranged it all years ago!'

208
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,440
'Hmm,' commented his father. 
'Haven't I heard about you and  

209
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,040
your wild amusements with Captain Crawley 
and that set? You should be careful, sir.'

210
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,720
Mr Osborne was secretly delighted that his 
son was mixing in such aristocratic company.  

211
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,600
He was very ambitious for George.

212
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,000
'Well, well,' he went on. 'I 
suppose young men will be young men.  

213
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,080
I'm glad you live in the best society of England.'

214
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,560
'One can't live in that kind of society for 
nothing, you know,' George said quietly.

215
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:10,800
'Don't worry about money, my boy,' Mr Osborne 
interrupted him. 'My money's as good as theirs.  

216
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,360
Call on Mr Chopper in the City tomorrow 
- he'll have something for you.'

217
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,000
'Thank you, sir.'

218
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,000
'You could marry higher than Amelia, you 
know,' Mr Osborne told him. 'I don't like  

219
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,640
the look of Sedley's affairs. There are rumours 
about his losses. If I don't see Amelia's ten  

220
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,200
thousand pounds you won't marry her. I 
won't have any lame ducks in my family.'

221
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,320
George was very attentive to Amelia when he went 
to join the ladies after his talk with his father.  

222
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,720
She remembered long afterwards the 
pleasure of that evening with him.

223
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,400
George hurried off to the City the next morning, 
and obtained a document from Mr Chopper.  

224
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,240
Then he hurried to the bank. He noticed 
that Mr Sedley was also in the bank,  

225
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,920
but he was too excited to notice the 
grim look on the older man's face.

226
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,000
Meanwhile Miss Crawley had returned to 
London from her visit to Queen's Crawley,  

227
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,280
bringing Becky Sharp with her. The old 
lady had eaten and drunk far too much,  

228
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,160
and was feeling unwell. She retired 
immediately to bed, and summoned her doctor.

229
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,200
Captain Crawley was one of the first people 
to arrive at her house to ask after her.  

230
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,600
He received gloomy reports from the 
maid and from Miss Briggs her companion.  

231
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,800
Captain Crawley was unable to see the 
patient, but he did manage to have a few  

232
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,840
minutes of private conversation with Becky. 
He left the house looking very cheerful.

233
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,120
Miss Briggs tried to gain admission to the sick 
lady's bedroom, but was refused. The poor lady  

234
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,800
had been a loyal and faithful companion for many 
years and was wounded by Miss Crawley's behaviour.

235
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,040
'But why won't she see me?' she asked Becky. 
'I always look after her when she's ill.'

236
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,520
'Don't be so upset,' Becky advised her. 'She 
won't see you because she prefers my nursing  

237
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,040
to yours, that's all. Sick people are like that 
sometimes. She'll be well again in a few weeks,  

238
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,880
and then I'll go back to Queen's Crawley.'

239
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,760
'Never, never,' Miss Briggs said sadly.

240
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,960
'She'll never be well, or I'll never 
go?' Becky asked with a little smile.

241
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,240
Captain Crawley called every day to receive 
the latest news from Becky. Every day the  

242
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,840
news was better, and soon Miss Crawley allowed the 
faithful Briggs to spend time with her once more.  

243
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,480
Becky used to mimic the good woman to her 
face for the amusement of the old lady.

244
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,920
Once Miss Crawley was well again, she 
agreed to accompany Becky to Russell Square  

245
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,320
so that the girl could be reunited 
with her old school friend, Amelia.

246
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,600
The visit was a short one, but Amelia made 
a good impression on the rich old lady.  

247
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,560
She talked enthusiastically about Becky's 
friend, and mentioned her to Captain Crawley.  

248
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,680
Becky was quick to explain that Amelia had a 
fiance - a certain Lieutenant George Osborne.

249
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,480
'What regiment is he in?' Rawdon asked.

250
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,800
'I don't recall,' Becky replied, 
'but his Captain's name is Dobbin.'

251
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,840
'I know Dobbin,' Rawdon told her. 'And I 
know Osborne too, now that I think of it.  

252
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,680
Osborne's a fool,' he commented happily. 'He 
wants to be seen in the company of a lord.  

253
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,920
He pays for their dinners, 
and they invite the guests.'

254
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,840
'Pretty guests,' Becky suggested with a smile.

255
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,520
'Quite right, Miss Sharp,' Rawdon 
laughed. 'Very pretty guests indeed.'

256
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,920
'Don't be so naughty, Rawdon!'  

257
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:45,760
the old lady laughed excitedly. Her 
nephew's cynicism delighted her enormously.

258
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,120
'Why don't we have him here?' Rawdon suggested.

259
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,720
Lieutenant Osborne and Amelia were invited 
for dinner at Miss Crawley's house.

260
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,360
The meeting between Becky and George Osborne 
was not an easy one. Becky suspected that it  

261
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,000
was George who had discouraged Jos Sedley from 
proposing to her after the dinner at Vauxhall  

262
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,040
Gardens. She greeted him very coolly. For his 
part, Osborne thought her vain and ambitious.

263
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,240
Amelia saw immediately that there was 
a friendship between Becky and Rawdon.  

264
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,920
Before leaving the house 
she went up to her friend.

265
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,320
'I see it all,' she said quietly.

266
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,160
Becky kissed her.

267
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,520
One day Sir Pitt Crawley came to 
London. His wife had just died,  

268
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,480
and the baronet was desperate 
to have Becky back at the house.

269
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,720
'You must come,' he told her.

270
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,600
'I'll come as soon as I can,' Becky replied.

271
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,280
'Everything's in a mess without you,' Sir 
Pitt complained. 'Dear Becky, do come!'

272
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,520
Becky looked at him closely.

273
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,760
'Come as what?' she asked quietly.

274
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,160
'Come as Lady Crawley, if you like,'  

275
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:02,880
the old man cried impatiently. 'Come back and 
be my wife. There! Does that satisfy you?'

276
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
'Oh Sir Pitt!' Becky cried.

277
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,800
'Say yes,' Sir Pit begged her. 'I'm an 
old man, Becky, but I'll make you happy,  

278
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,520
you see if I don't.' The old man 
got down on his knees before her.

279
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,080
Becky jumped back. For once 
she did not know what to say.

280
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,600
'Oh, Sir Pitt!' she cried again. 
'Oh - sir - I'm married already!'

281
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,240
CHAPTER FOUR

282
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,800
A Family Bankruptcy

283
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,480
Miss Briggs happened to be passing the room 
where the interview between Becky and Sir  

284
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,440
Pitt was taking place. She heard both his offer 
of marriage, and Becky's refusal of it. She did  

285
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,560
not stay long enough, however, to hear the reason 
for the refusal - that Becky was already married.

286
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,400
Miss Briggs carried the 
exciting news to Miss Crawley.

287
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,000
Miss Crawley was impressed that Becky had refused 
the baronet, and secretly relieved. She talked the  

288
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,440
matter over with Briggs, and the two women agreed 
that Becky must be in love with someone else.

289
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,480
'Find out who it is,' Miss 
Crawley ordered her companion.

290
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,880
Becky admitted to Miss Briggs that she was in love 
with someone else, but she refused to tell Briggs  

291
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,800
who the man was. She did not tell Miss Crawley 
either when the old lady interrogated her.

292
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,840
'You will know soon enough, my dear,' she said.

293
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,720
That evening, when she was alone 
in her bedroom, she wrote a letter.

294
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,600
 

295
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,800
Dear friend,

296
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,640
Half of our secret is known, and I'm 
sure that the time has come to tell  

297
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,200
everything. It's risky, I know, 
but I'm sure we'll win in the end.  

298
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,240
Miss Crawley is very sympathetic and generous. 
I think everything will be all right!

299
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,000
She addressed the letter 
to 'Miss Elizabeth Styles'.  

300
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,800
The reader will not perhaps be 
surprised that Miss Elizabeth Styles,  

301
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,600
who wore a military uniform, was none 
other than Captain Rawdon Crawley.

302
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,760
The next morning Becky's bedroom was 
empty. She had left a note for Briggs,  

303
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,240
explaining the mystery of her marriage and 
asking her to break the news to Miss Crawley.

304
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,400
It was bad luck for Becky that Mrs Bute 
Crawley arrived at the house that morning.  

305
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,840
Briggs told her the whole story, and 
they went to Miss Crawley together.

306
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,800
The old lady was horrified at the news, 
and had another attack of illness.

307
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:44,320
'I'll never forgive them!' she said. 'And I'll 
never give Rawdon another penny of my money.'

308
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,320
Sir Pitt also came to the house that 
morning. He wanted to see Becky.

309
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,320
'She's got to come back to Queen's Crawley with 
me,' he told Briggs. 'I can't manage without her.'

310
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,600
'But don't you know she's married?' 
Briggs replied in astonishment.

311
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,240
'What do I care about that?' the baronet 
said angrily. 'I know she's married.'

312
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,120
'She left the house this morning, sir,'  

313
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,080
Briggs explained. 'Miss Crawley is very upset 
by the news of her marriage to Captain Rawdon.'

314
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,160
When Sir Pitt heard that Becky 
was married to his own son,  

315
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,680
he broke into a furious rage. Then 
he left the house very noisily.

316
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,480
'But what if she doesn't forgive me?'  

317
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,840
Rawdon asked his wife that night, as they sat 
together in their modest little apartment.

318
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,560
'Don't worry about that,' Becky said 
sweetly. 'I'll make your fortune for you.'

319
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,320
'You can do anything,' he replied tenderly.

320
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,280
There is one event in Vanity Fair that 
attracts both sentiment and satire,  

321
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,800
and that is the auction of a bankrupt person's 
household goods. People who attend these auctions  

322
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:02,000
remember how things were different in the 
past, how the person who is penniless now,  

323
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
used to offer his guests 
the finest wines and food.

324
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,640
An auction was taking place at the Sedley 
household. Old Sedley was now a ruined man.

325
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,960
Captain Dobbin was at the auction. He was 
very interested in a little piano that had  

326
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,120
belonged to Amelia. His agent began to bid for the 
instrument, as did Becky's agent on her behalf.  

327
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,560
The bidding was fast, and the price rose high.  

328
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,800
At last Becky's agent ceased to bid, and the 
piano became the property of Captain Dobbin.

329
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,320
The piano arrived that evening at a 
modest little house off the Fulham Road,  

330
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,840
where the Sedleys were now living.

331
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,880
'He was a kind man, Mr Sedley,' Becky 
commented dreamily to Rawdon. She was  

332
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,960
remembering her stay at the house. 'I'm 
sorry it's all gone wrong for him.'

333
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,800
'Oh, these stockbrokers,' Rawdon said carelessly, 
'they're used to this sort of thing, you know.  

334
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,280
I'm sorry for your little friend Amelia,  

335
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,600
though. I suppose young Osborne will 
think twice before he marries her now!'

336
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,440
Rawdon's guess was not far wrong. 
Amelia had received a letter from  

337
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,840
George Osborne's father immediately the news 
of the bankruptcy became public knowledge.  

338
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,640
Mr Osborne told her that her father had behaved 
very badly, and that it was no longer possible for  

339
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,880
the two families to know each other. She showed 
the letter to her father, who was very angry.  

340
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,920
He ordered her to return every letter and 
present that she had received from George,  

341
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,080
and to forget about him. Amelia sent back 
the few presents that George had given her,  

342
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,640
but she kept his letters. They 
were her most precious possessions.

343
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,000
There was more exciting news from Europe.  

344
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,360
Napoleon had escaped from Elba and returned 
to France. Everyone knew that war was coming.

345
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,640
One day Dobbin found his friend George Osborne in 
his room at the barracks. He looked very upset.

346
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,880
'She's sent me back all the presents I gave her,' 
George told his friend. 'It's all over. Look,  

347
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,120
read this.' He passed Dobbin a letter from Amelia.

348
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,080
Dobbin had visited Mr Sedley and the family 
in their new house off the Fulham Road.  

349
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,800
He knew that Amelia was very ill.

350
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
'She's dying, George,' he said quietly.

351
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,080
A few hours later George Osborne 
paid a visit to the Sedley household.

352
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:37,120
Mrs Bute Crawley established herself at Miss 
Crawley's house in London to nurse the old lady.  

353
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,960
She made sure that letters from Rawdon 
Crawley were intercepted. She read Miss  

354
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,720
Crawley religious stories, and encouraged her 
to consider serious matters. It was her hope  

355
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,840
that Miss Crawley was planning to write a new 
will, leaving some of her money to Bute Crawley.

356
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Mrs Bute Crawley was very successful in her 
arrangements. Perhaps she was too successful.  

357
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,920
She frightened and depressed Miss Crawley instead 
of amusing her. Even her doctors thought that the  

358
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:13,360
effect of Mrs Bute Crawley's influence was 
dangerous. One of them tried to talk to her.

359
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,040
'You have done a lot for our poor patient,' he 
told her. 'But she is not as ill as she was.  

360
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,520
Indeed, she needs fresh air now. If you 
keep her in the house, she may really die!'

361
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,280
At last an expedition to the park was organised.  

362
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,720
Miss Crawley's carriage was soon spotted 
by Becky and Rawdon, who were also out  

363
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,640
driving. Rawdon drove past his aunt, and 
saluted her gravely. His aunt ignored him.

364
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,200
'That's it, then,' he commented to 
Becky. 'She won't acknowledge me.'

365
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,480
CHAPTER FIVE

366
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,600
A Wedding and a Disinheritance

367
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,800
Captain Dobbin now found himself in a very painful  

368
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,880
and difficult position. He could see that 
George was less and less keen to marry Amelia,  

369
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,920
and he realised that he himself 
was falling in love with her.

370
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,000
'She will die if George does 
not marry her,' he thought.  

371
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,360
He determined to make sure 
that the wedding went ahead.

372
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,600
George and his father, meanwhile, 
had quarrelled bitterly.  

373
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,240
Mr Osborne wanted his son to marry a 
rich girl. George, however, who had been  

374
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,960
influenced by Dobbin's account of Amelia's 
sufferings, promised to be true to his word.

375
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,360
'I'll have no beggars in my family, 
sir!' his father roared. 'Marry Amelia  

376
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,520
and you leave this house for ever - you 
leave it a penniless man, I tell you!'

377
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,840
'I've done it, Dobbin,' George 
told his friend afterwards.

378
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,102
'Done what?' Dobbin asked.

379
00:31:46,102 --> 00:31:47,840
'I've told my father,'  

380
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,000
George informed him. 'I'll marry her tomorrow 
- I love her more and more each day!'

381
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,960
One morning a quiet wedding took place in London. 
Amelia was the bride and George the bridegroom.  

382
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,920
The best man was the faithful Dobbin.  

383
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:09,520
Jos Sedley was also in attendance, as was Mrs 
Sedley. Mr Sedley did not attend the ceremony.

384
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,320
George and Amelia went to Brighton for their 
honeymoon. They were accompanied by Jos Sedley.  

385
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:22,800
Here they met up with Captain Crawley and his 
wife. Jos was now wearing military-style clothing  

386
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,840
in honour of the coming war, and George 
and Captain Crawley teased him about it.

387
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,520
The two couples spent most of their time together.  

388
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,200
The gentlemen had their own amusements after 
dinner. They usually played billiards or cards,  

389
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,840
and this allowed Captain Crawley to 
acquire some much-needed ready money.

390
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,760
One day Dobbin came down to 
Brighton to see his friends.  

391
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,080
He greeted them in a friendly 
way, but his face was serious.

392
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,880
'What's the news?' George asked 
eagerly. 'What does my father say?'

393
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,600
'I'll tell you everything later,' Dobbin said 
quietly. 'The really important thing is - '

394
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,320
'Come on, tell us!' George cried excitedly.

395
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,000
'The campaign's started. We're going to Belgium, 
old boy. O'Dowd's in command. We leave next week.'

396
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,840
It was true that Dobbin had been to see Mr 
Osborne, to break the news of his son's marriage  

397
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,480
to Amelia. The interview had not been a success. 
Mr Osborne was furious at his son's disobedience,  

398
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,840
and furious with poor Dobbin as well 
for having encouraged the match.

399
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,240
When he returned home that evening, Mr Osborne sat 
for many hours in his study. He adored his son,  

400
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,240
but he was a very proud man, and George's 
marriage had disappointed him bitterly.  

401
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,200
Mr Osborne took down the family Bible, where 
the names of all his children were inscribed.  

402
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,400
He eliminated George's name. Then 
he wrote a letter to the bank,  

403
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,840
instructing the cashier not to 
pay further funds to his son.

404
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,320
Another visitor who was staying 
at Brighton was Miss Crawley.  

405
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,840
Becky made Rawdon write the old lady 
a note. Then Becky took the note to  

406
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,400
Briggs and begged her to deliver it. 
Miss Crawley laughed when she read it.

407
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
'Don't you see,' she cried, 
'Rawdon never wrote a word of it!  

408
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,840
His letters are always about money, and 
they're full of spelling mistakes and bad  

409
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:30,160
grammar. It's that little governess of his who 
told him what to say!' In her heart she felt  

410
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:36,240
sad and bitter. She knew that everyone 
wanted her dead; they wanted her money.

411
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:46,320
'You may tell Captain Crawley,' she informed 
Briggs, 'that he can call on my lawyer in London.  

412
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,080
There will be something for him there.'

413
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,280
Rawdon and Becky were delighted 
at the news from Miss Crawley.  

414
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,680
They hurried as fast as they 
could to London. Rawdon then  

415
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,160
made his way to the lawyer's office. 
He looked gloomy when he joined Becky.

416
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,200
'It's a rotten trick, Becky,' he told her. 
'The old lady's only given me twenty pounds!'

417
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,000
The joke was too good for Becky to resist.  

418
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,080
She looked at Rawdon's serious 
face, and burst out laughing.

419
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,360
CHAPTER SIX

420
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,840
Preparations for War

421
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,720
The Osbornes and Dobbin now made their way 
to Chatham, from where the regiment was to  

422
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,360
embark for Europe. Amelia was presented to 
Peggy O'Dowd, the commanding officer's wife.  

423
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,800
Peggy O'Dowd was a friendly Irishwoman, 
and she made Amelia very welcome.

424
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,800
'We're all good friends here,' 
she explained cheerfully. 'There  

425
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,960
isn't a happier regiment in the whole army.'

426
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,560
Jos had agreed to accompany Amelia to Europe,  

427
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,800
and everyone noticed that his appearance 
became more and more military every day.

428
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,280
At last they arrived in Brussels 
where the regiment was quartered.  

429
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,360
Everyone was delighted with the city, and all 
the Vanity Fair booths were laid out before them  

430
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,680
with their usual attractions. There 
was gambling for those who liked it,  

431
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,720
there was a theatre, and above all, there was 
a huge throng of lords, ladies and gentlemen.

432
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,360
George was enthusiastic about the social 
life of Brussels. One evening he danced with  

433
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,720
one of Lady Bareacre's daughters. He even 
invited the Bareacres to a grand dinner.  

434
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,840
They accepted the invitation, but 
they refused to speak to poor Amelia,  

435
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:43,680
whom they considered their social inferior. She 
passed a very miserable evening in their company.

436
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,760
One day Captain Crawley and 
Becky arrived in the city.  

437
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,840
They were travelling with General Tufto, and 
they mixed in the very highest military circles.  

438
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,880
George was quite proud to know the Crawleys, 
and to be seen around the city with them.

439
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,840
Becky was in the very best of humours. She 
teased poor Jos about their old romance,  

440
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,640
and she flirted with George. Amelia 
was uncomfortable in her presence.  

441
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,920
She felt that Becky's influence 
on her husband was not a good one.

442
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,720
Dobbin was more forthright still.

443
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,480
'What a humbug that woman 
is!' he commented to George.

444
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,080
A grand ball was planned, and everyone was 
desperate to have a ticket to the social  

445
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,680
event of the year. Jos and Mrs O'Dowd were 
unlucky, but the Bareacres obtained tickets  

446
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,880
for Captain Osborne and his wife. Dobbin 
was given a ticket by a general he knew.

447
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,920
George bought new clothes for Amelia, and drove 
her to the ball. She did not know anyone there,  

448
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,440
and sat by herself while her husband 
went off to look for his friends.  

449
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,000
Amelia was unhappy, and the only person 
who came to talk to her was honest Dobbin.

450
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,520
Becky, meanwhile, had made a splendid entrance. 
She immediately joined the most select  

451
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,080
group of people at the ball, and was soon 
the centre of attention with the men there.  

452
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:14,240
She spoke French perfectly, and everyone wanted to 
dance with her. Then she spotted Amelia, and came  

453
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:20,480
over to join her on the bench. She criticised 
her clothes, commented happily on the ball,  

454
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,640
and then gave her friend a lot of advice 
that humiliated poor Amelia even more.

455
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,960
When George saw that Becky had joined his wife,  

456
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,440
he too hurried over to the bench. He 
asked Becky to dance, and she agreed.  

457
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:40,800
They danced together two or three times. Amelia 
was very unhappy. Tears came into her eyes.

458
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,840
Then George ran back to collect 
Becky's shawl and flowers.  

459
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,000
Becky was leaving the ball. 
George carried her bouquet to her,  

460
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,120
but when he gave it to her she saw that there 
was a note lying among the flowers. Becky had  

461
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,320
received many such notes in her life. She smiled 
at George, and turned towards her husband.

462
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,160
Amelia was watching the scene between 
George and Becky. She turned very pale.

463
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,240
'William,' she said quietly, 'I don't 
feel very well. Please take me home.'

464
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,880
Dobbin escorted her away from the ball.

465
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,760
George, meanwhile, was in a very elated mood. He 
did not notice that his wife had left the ball.  

466
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,920
He gambled at the tables, winning repeatedly. 
Then he began drinking heavily. Dobbin found  

467
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,440
him in a very excitable mood when 
he returned from Amelia's hotel.

468
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,800
'Come out, George,' Dobbin said quietly.

469
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,240
'Nonsense!' George cried. 'Come 
and drink with me, my old friend!'

470
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,400
Dobbin came close to him.

471
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,640
'The enemy is advancing,' he whispered. 
'We're leaving in three hours.'

472
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,120
There was little sleep for anyone that night.  

473
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,680
Everyone was busy preparing for the 
sudden departure for the battlefield.

474
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,280
George made his way quickly to the 
hotel, where Amelia was already in bed.  

475
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,280
He thought about the short weeks 
of his marriage and blushed with  

476
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,160
shame when he thought about the 
note he had given to Becky Sharp.

477
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,240
'What will happen to Amelia 
if I die?' he asked himself.

478
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,240
He wrote a letter to his father, asking him 
to look after his wife if he was killed,  

479
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,160
and thanking him for his past kindness.

480
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,840
He was very kind to her the next morning before 
he went away. Amelia was very upset to see him go.

481
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,960
The O'Dowds were also making their 
preparations for the departure.

482
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,960
'Call me at half-past one, my dear,' the Major 
said quietly to his wife. 'And have my things  

483
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,000
ready for me.' This was his way of indicating 
that the regiment was marching the next morning.

484
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,840
Rawdon spent the last hours with Becky reckoning  

485
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,720
up what he could leave behind for 
Becky if anything happened to him.

486
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,440
'Look,' he said, 'I've been 
lucky recently at cards - here's  

487
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,560
two hundred and fifty pounds in 
cash. Then there are my horses.'

488
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,320
Captain Crawley, who cheated his friends at cards,  

489
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:04,000
and who never paid his debts, had tears in his 
eyes when he lifted Becky up to kiss her goodbye.  

490
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,480
Becky had wisely decided not 
to give in to her emotions.

491
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,280
Captain Dobbin called on Jos 
very early in the morning.  

492
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,240
Jos was not pleased to be woken up and 
he greeted Dobbin without enthusiasm.

493
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,640
'What can I do for you?' he enquired coldly.

494
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,640
'George and I are marching in an hour,' Dobbin 
explained. 'I want you to look after your sister.  

495
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,520
If something happens to the army, take her back 
to England. You're the only person she's got!'

496
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,600
Soon after they all marched out of the city.

497
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,120
CHAPTER SEVEN

498
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,840
The Battle of Waterloo

499
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,920
There was great excitement in Brussels after  

500
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,040
the British army had marched 
out to meet Napoleon's troops.

501
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,160
Jos, meanwhile, was surprised to receive 
a visit from Becky Sharp that morning.  

502
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,640
He had not been invited to any of the 
grand social events in which she had  

503
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,760
played such a brilliant part, and he 
was offended at her neglect. Becky,  

504
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,800
who was not sure of a British victory, decided 
to become friends with her old admirer again.

505
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,680
'I'm sure you're getting ready to join the army,'  

506
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,320
she told him. 'Soon there'll be nobody 
left in Brussels to protect us poor women!'

507
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,520
Jos was delighted at the idea that 
she thought he was joining the army.

508
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,800
'I should like to see the battle,' he replied 
grandly, 'but I have my sister to protect.'

509
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,800
'What a good brother you are!' Becky exclaimed. 
She put her handkerchief to her eyes.  

510
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:45,600
'Your heart is true to your sister,' she went on, 
'but I remember a time when it was false to me!'

511
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,360
Jos blushed furiously. He did 
not know what to say to her.

512
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,240
'I've avoided you here in Brussels,' Becky 
went on. 'What else could I do? Do you think  

513
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,880
my husband could bear to speak to you? You're the 
only man he's ever been jealous of, you know!'

514
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:07,360
Poor Jos was delighted at this speech. He 
forgot his doubts and suspicions of Becky.

515
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,760
Becky observed him closely.

516
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,560
'At least he'll give me a place in his 
carriage if the army is defeated,' she thought.

517
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,240
Becky then went into Amelia's room to greet her. 
She found her ill because she was worried about  

518
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,320
George. Amelia regarded her as an enemy now, and 
the interview was a painful one for the two women.

519
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,840
'You tried to do me wrong,' Amelia complained. 
'You tried to take my husband from me,  

520
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:40,960
Rebecca. But he came back to me, you see - 
he came back to me!' She burst into tears.

521
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,000
Becky left Amelia's room. For once she was silent.  

522
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:53,360
Her friend's tears had moved her. She happened to 
encounter Mrs Peggy O'Dowd in the street outside,  

523
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:58,240
and she told her that Amelia was very 
upset. The good lady hurried to the house.

524
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,560
Brussels was full of rumours 
about the great battle.  

525
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,360
Jos grew increasingly nervous. 
He was not a brave man,  

526
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:13,120
and what he heard from his servants frightened 
him. He began to think about leaving the city. He  

527
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,440
told Amelia that he thought it was best to prepare 
to leave, but she refused to listen to him.

528
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:25,680
That night Jos's fears increased to panic. Some 
Belgian soldiers had retreated into the city,  

529
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,960
and one of these took refuge with the maid 
in Jos's house. The young soldier was tired  

530
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,840
and hungry, and he told terrible stories 
about the defeat of the British army.

531
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,400
'The Duke of Wellington is 
a prisoner,' he insisted,  

532
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,960
'and the whole army is in 
flight. Napoleon has won.'

533
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,560
Jos had come into the kitchen 
to hear the soldier's account,  

534
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:50,080
and he was now wild with terror. He changed out of 
his military-style clothes as quickly as he could,  

535
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,240
and ordered his servant to prepare the carriage.

536
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,640
'There are no horses left in 
Brussels, sir,' the servant told him.

537
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:03,600
Jos dashed into the street. He ran to all 
the hotels in a desperate search for horses.  

538
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,280
In one hotel he saw Lady Bareacres and 
her daughters sitting in a carriage.  

539
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,600
They, too, were waiting for horses.

540
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,000
Lady Bareacres was also 
desperate to abandon the city.  

541
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,440
This proud lady, who had refused to acknowledge 
Becky when they passed on the stairs,  

542
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,240
now came to ask her to sell 
Captain Crawley's horses.

543
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,880
'I won't sell you my horses, my 
Lady,' Becky told her proudly,  

544
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,600
'not for the two largest 
diamonds you wore at the ball.'

545
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,760
Just then Becky caught sight 
of Jos entering the hotel.  

546
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,440
The frightened expression on 
his face told her everything.

547
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,800
'He will buy my horses,' she decided.

548
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,400
Jos and Becky were soon in earnest 
conversation together. The price  

549
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,360
she asked for the horses was a huge one, but 
Jos was so terrified that he agreed to pay.

550
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,400
Jos now told his servant to prepare the horses. 
He had decided to ride out of the city as soon  

551
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,280
as he could. He went back once more to 
Amelia to persuade her to come with him.

552
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,400
'Emmy, I'm leaving today,' he told her, 'and 
you must come with me. There's no time to lose!'

553
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,920
'You're a coward, Mr Sedley,' 
Peggy O'Dowd told him quietly.

554
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,840
'Never mind her!' cried Jos. 'Are 
you coming with me or not, Emmy?'

555
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,760
Amelia was too ill to move.

556
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,560
'Without my husband, Jos?' Amelia replied.

557
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,600
Jos saw that it was useless.

558
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:32,240
'Goodbye, then,' he said in a rage, and left the 
room. A few minutes later the two ladies saw him  

559
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,040
riding awkwardly down the street on one of Becky's 
horses, followed by his servant on the other.

560
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,840
The noise of the great battle could be 
heard throughout the city all that day.  

561
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,960
At last the guns grew silent. 
The English had their victory.

562
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:53,440
Darkness fell. Amelia was praying for 
her husband, who was lying on his face,  

563
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,840
dead, with a bullet through his heart.

564
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,480
CHAPTER EIGHT

565
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,240
Miss Crawley

566
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,400
Miss Crawley was now living in Brighton, 
and she read the news of the Battle of  

567
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,280
Waterloo with great interest. Rawdon 
had been promoted; he was now a Colonel.

568
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,600
'What a pity that fine young 
man behaved as he did!'  

569
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:24,320
said the kind-hearted Briggs. She wanted 
Miss Crawley to forgive Rawdon and Becky.

570
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:30,000
'Rawdon's a fool,' the old lady replied angrily. 
'He could have married well if he'd had my  

571
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,880
money behind him. But he won't get any of it now!'

572
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,320
Rawdon and Becky took good care to 
write regularly to Miss Crawley,  

573
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,040
and the old lady was amused by their letters,  

574
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,200
although she knew perfectly well that it 
was Becky who wrote them and not her nephew.

575
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,320
Miss Crawley's attitude to the family 
at the rectory was not so warm.  

576
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,840
She had been frightened by Mrs Bute Crawley 
during her illness in London. Worse than that,  

577
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:02,080
she had been bored by the rector's wife. Still, 
presents of farm produce arrived regularly at Miss  

578
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:07,200
Crawley's house in Brighton, with tender notes 
of affection from the family at the rectory.

579
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,760
Rawdon's brother, Pitt, was 
also attentive to his aunt.  

580
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,360
He came frequently to Brighton to visit his 
fiancee, Lady Jane Sheepshanks, who lived in the  

581
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:23,200
town with her sisters and mother, the formidable 
and religious-minded Countess Southdown.

582
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,480
Pitt hinted to Lady Southdown that 
it might be beneficial for her family  

583
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,760
to make a friendship with his aunt. He told her 
that Miss Crawley was now all alone in the world.

584
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,440
'I'll certainly visit the poor lady,' the Countess  

585
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,840
responded enthusiastically. 'I'll leave 
her some religious literature as well.'

586
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:48,400
'No, my dear lady,' said the artful Pitt. 'She 
has been seriously ill, and she has not been  

587
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:55,520
accustomed to think of spiritual matters. We 
must proceed slowly. Besides,' he added quietly,  

588
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:01,520
'we don't want to frighten the poor lady. She 
has seventy thousand pounds. Think of that.'

589
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,080
Countess Southdown nodded her head in agreement.

590
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,640
The next day the Southdown carriage 
pulled up outside Miss Crawley's house.

591
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,400
The visit was a great success, and Miss Crawley 
took particularly to Pitt's fiancee Lady Jane.  

592
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,640
Pitt was in high spirits,  

593
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,800
and spent his time daydreaming about 
the old lady's seventy thousand pounds.

594
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,720
News of the friendship between Pitt Crawley 
and his aunt soon reached the rectory,  

595
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,960
and Mrs Bute Crawley decided to 
make one further effort to win  

596
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,640
the old lady's fortune for her family. She 
sent her son James to visit Miss Crawley.

597
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,160
James was a student. He was a simple young fellow, 
more interested in sport and beer than in his  

598
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:51,200
studies. He was no match for Pitt Crawley. The 
older man encouraged him to drink too much wine,  

599
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:58,720
and led him on to entertain the ladies with some 
exciting sporting stories. James swayed drunkenly  

600
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,920
up the stairs to his bedroom. When he arrived 
there he opened the window and lit his pipe.  

601
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,200
He stared happily out at the sea, smoking 
contentedly. He had forgotten, however,  

602
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:14,800
to close the bedroom door behind him - and the 
smell of pipe tobacco spread through the house.

603
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,240
The following morning he 
received a note from Briggs.

604
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,000
Dear Sir,

605
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,600
Miss Crawley has spent a sleepless night because 
of the smell of pipe tobacco throughout the house.  

606
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,640
She is to unwell to see you 
before you leave the house.

607
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,920
And so ended the rectory family's hopes 
of receiving Miss Crawley's fortune.

608
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,280
Rawdon and Becky, meanwhile, were enjoying 
themselves in Paris, where they had enough  

609
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,200
money to live in luxury thanks to the 
huge price Jos had paid for the horses.

610
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:50,640
Becky gave birth to a son during their stay in 
Paris. Miss Crawley was furious at the news,  

611
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,840
and immediately ordered 
Pitt and Lady Jane to marry.  

612
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,000
She promised to leave them the bulk 
of her fortune after her death.

613
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,760
The newlyweds settled into 
Miss Crawley's Brighton home,  

614
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,320
and they were all ruled over by Lady 
Southdown from her neighbouring house.  

615
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:14,880
Lady Southdown was so terrifying that Miss Crawley 
lost all her cheerfulness. She even began to treat  

616
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:23,040
Briggs kindly as she moved slowly towards death. 
The old lady died clinging in fear to Lady Jane.

617
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,880
CHAPTER NINE

618
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,760
Life on Nothing a Year

619
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:40,720
News was continually arriving in England of the 
terrible casualties of the Battle of Waterloo.  

620
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:46,160
The Osborne family learned of George's 
death. Old Mr Osborne was grief- stricken  

621
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,800
but he carried on his business as usual. 
He never mentioned George's name to anyone.

622
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,920
One day Dobbin's father, Sir William 
Dobbin, called at Mr Osborne's house.

623
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,480
'My son has sent me a letter 
for you,' he explained.

624
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:05,360
Mr Osborne looked at the letter, and his 
heart began to beat quickly. The writing  

625
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,640
was his son's. It was the letter George had 
written before leaving Amelia in Brussels.

626
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,120
Mr Osborne suffered greatly in this period. 
He travelled to Belgium to visit the site of  

627
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,800
the historic battlefield, and 
he saw George's burial-place.

628
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:27,920
One evening, as he was coming back into Brussels, 
Mr Osborne saw a carriage driving towards him.  

629
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,960
An officer was riding by the side 
of it. Mr Osborne was surprised to  

630
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,320
see that one of the occupants of the 
carriage was his son's widow Amelia,  

631
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:43,120
and that the officer on horseback was his son's 
friend Dobbin. Amelia was pale and withdrawn,  

632
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:48,400
and did not notice her father-in-law. He, 
however, gazed at her in fury and hatred.

633
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,200
A few minutes later Dobbin rode 
up to Mr Osborne's carriage.  

634
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,800
He held out his hand but Mr 
Osborne refused to take it.

635
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,760
'I have a message for you,' Dobbin said quietly. 
'I am the executor of George's will, and am  

636
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,480
therefore responsible for his widow's welfare. 
Are you aware how little money he left her?'

637
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,480
Dobbin explained that Amelia was expecting 
a child. He tried to persuade Mr Osborne  

638
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,120
that the time for hatred and bitterness was 
gone, and that Amelia needed his support.

639
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,640
'I have promised to have nothing 
to do with that woman, sir,'  

640
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,560
Mr Osborne commented angrily. 
'I shall not change my mind.'

641
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:32,400
Months now passed, and Amelia gave birth to 
a son. The loyal Major Dobbin was constantly  

642
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,400
in attendance upon her, and brought her 
back to her parents' house in England.  

643
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:42,720
He became the baby's godfather. The poor 
girl was so depressed by the death of  

644
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,920
George that she did not seem to notice the 
Major's kindness to her. Dobbin, however,  

645
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:53,040
never dared to mention his love to her. He knew 
that Amelia was loyal to her husband's memory.

646
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,800
One day the Major came to Amelia's 
house looking particularly serious.

647
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,160
'I'm going away,' he told her. 'I shall be gone a  

648
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,040
long time. You'll write to 
me, won't you, my dear?'

649
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,800
'I'll write to you about little 
Georgy,' Amelia replied with a smile.  

650
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,440
'How kind you've been to us, dear William!'

651
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,080
Three or four years after their triumphant stay in 
Paris, Rawdon Crawley and Becky were living in a  

652
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:23,840
fine little house in Curzon Street, Mayfair. 
They entertained their friends splendidly.  

653
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,080
Yet there were few of their friends 
who did not sometimes wonder  

654
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,880
how Colonel Crawley managed to live so well. 
He did not seem to have any income at all.

655
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,320
There are many people in Vanity Fair 
who succeed very well on nothing a year.  

656
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,360
The Colonel, for example, was an excellent 
card-player, and excelled at billiards and  

657
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,760
other games of chance. He spent many 
evenings playing against his friends,  

658
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,640
and his winnings provided him and Becky with 
the small amounts of cash they required.  

659
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,000
For the rest, the couple lived on credit, as 
many others in Vanity Fair are obliged to do.

660
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,000
The house in Curzon Street 
belonged to a Mr Raggles,  

661
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,920
who had previously been Miss Crawley's butler. 
After leaving Miss Crawley's service, Mr Raggles  

662
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:14,480
and his wife had bought a shop selling foodstuffs. 
They worked hard and saved their money carefully.  

663
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,240
After many years Mr Raggles was able to 
buy the little house in Curzon Street.  

664
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,600
He intended to rent out the property and was 
delighted to have a member of the Crawley  

665
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:31,040
family as his tenant. The young couple also 
ordered their food from the Raggles' shop.

666
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,200
One of Becky's first plans when they 
settled in London was to establish  

667
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,640
good relations with Rawdon's brother, Pitt. He 
had inherited most of Miss Crawley's fortune.

668
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:49,200
Although Rawdon and Becky had their house in 
Mayfair and gave select little parties there,  

669
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:55,200
society ladies did not want anything to do with 
Becky. They had heard too many unpleasant stories  

670
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,800
about her from people like Lady Bareacres. Most 
of the visitors to Curzon Street were gentlemen.  

671
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,080
Becky found this position humiliating, and 
she determined to do something about it.

672
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:12,720
One of the regular visitors to the Crawley 
household was Lord Steyne, a great and powerful  

673
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:19,120
nobleman who occupied a very strong position in 
London society. Lord Steyne was one of Becky's  

674
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:24,240
greatest admirers. Becky thought that Lord 
Steyne could introduce her to London society.

675
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,080
This was not a happy time for Rawdon himself.  

676
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,960
He knew that people came to the house 
to see his brilliant and charming wife,  

677
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,160
and that they found him a bore. He preferred 
to spend his time with his little son, Rawdon.  

678
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,840
He went for long walks with the boy, and he 
took him to see his old friends at the barracks.

679
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:49,920
CHAPTER TEN

680
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,000
Misleading Letters

681
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:58,000
Jos Sedley returned to India 
after his adventures in Brussels.  

682
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,400
He sent a small amount of money to his parents 
to maintain their modest little house in Fulham.

683
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,480
The Sedley household lived in a very small way.  

684
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,720
Old Mr Sedley tried various little business 
schemes in an effort to recover his fortune,  

685
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:18,400
but all of them came to nothing. Amelia herself 
had no thoughts for anything except her son.

686
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:24,160
The family received few visitors 
now that Dobbin was abroad again,  

687
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,840
although the local curate at the church 
where they worshipped called quite often.  

688
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:33,360
People said the reason for his calls was Amelia, 
but she took little notice of the young man.

689
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,640
The years went by, and George 
grew into a healthy young boy.  

690
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,200
He was full of energy, and everyone 
said he looked just like his father.

691
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:51,040
Old Sir Pitt Crawley died, to the relief of all 
his family. He had become increasingly eccentric  

692
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:57,600
in his final years, and his behaviour had been 
a scandal throughout the county. His son, Pitt,  

693
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:02,640
inherited the property and the title, and as he 
had already inherited Miss Crawley's fortune,  

694
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:09,360
he was now a man of substance and importance. 
His thoughts turned to a career in politics.

695
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:15,760
Rawdon and Becky were, of course, invited to 
attend the old man's funeral at Queen's Crawley.  

696
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,720
Becky received the invitation with delight.

697
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,520
'Why are you so happy about it?' Rawdon 
asked in astonishment. 'There's no money  

698
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,840
coming to me from my father's death. 
You don't really want to go, do you?'

699
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:32,560
'Of course we're going!' Becky cried. 'Lady 
Jane shall present me at Court next year,  

700
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,880
and Pitt will give you a seat in Parliament!'

701
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,240
'What about little Rawdy - is he coming with us?'  

702
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,760
Rawdon asked tenderly. He did not like being 
parted from his son for more than a few days.

703
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,920
'No,' said Becky, 'he can stay here 
with Briggs - she'll look after him.'  

704
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,640
The faithful Briggs had come to work for 
the young couple after Miss Crawley's death.

705
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:59,120
The visit was a great success for Becky. She 
behaved herself with modesty and tact in front  

706
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:04,640
of the new Sir Pitt Crawley, and flattered his 
political ambitions. She talked sentimentally  

707
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:09,280
about her son in front of the kind-hearted 
Lady Jane, and won that lady's friendship.  

708
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,440
With Lady Jane's mother, the Countess 
of Southdown, she talked religion.

709
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,000
Amelia, meanwhile, wrote 
regularly to Major Dobbin,  

710
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,720
who was with the army in India. She 
gave him all the news about Georgy.  

711
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:28,080
She also visited his sisters sometimes. One 
day the sisters told her some important news.

712
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:31,200
'William's getting married.'

713
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,280
She wrote to congratulate him, and 
to wish him happiness for the future.

714
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:41,200
Georgy went to see Dobbin's sisters by 
himself sometimes, and he came back from one  

715
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,400
such visit wearing a beautiful gold watch. 
He said that a lady had given it to him.  

716
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:51,040
Amelia guessed that the lady was 
a member of the Osborne family.  

717
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:56,640
In fact, it was George Osborne's sister, who 
had also been visiting the Dobbin sisters.

718
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,680
When Miss Osborne arrived home that afternoon, 
she told old Mr Osborne that she had seen Georgy.

719
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,480
'He looks just like his 
father,' she said tearfully.

720
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:14,000
The old man did not reply, but he went very red 
in the face and began to shake with emotion. He  

721
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,160
still hated the Sedleys, but he wanted to see his 
grandson. Slowу a plan began to form in his mind.

722
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:26,080
Dobbin was astonished to receive Amelia's letter 
congratulating him on his coming marriage.  

723
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:31,440
It was true that Peggy O'Dowd had been trying 
to persuade him to marry a relative of hers,  

724
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,000
but Dobbin was in love with Amelia. He 
was not interested in any other girls.  

725
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,840
When he read Amelia's letter he realised that 
she did not understand what he felt for her.

726
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,480
'Don't you realise that it's you I love?' 
he thought. 'Don't you remember how I looked  

727
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,000
after you when George was killed - how 
I brought you safely back to England?'

728
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,520
A little while later Dobbin received 
another letter from England. His  

729
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,760
sisters told him about Amelia. 'She's 
going to marry the curate at her local  

730
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,880
church,' they wrote. 'And Georgy is 
going to live with his grandfather.'

731
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,960
Both pieces of news disturbed Dobbin very much.

732
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:13,120
'Amelia will not marry again,' he thought, 
'and I'm sure she'll never give up Georgy to Mr  

733
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:19,120
Osborne.' He suspected that she was in trouble, 
and once again he was determined to help her.  

734
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,840
He immediately asked for 
urgent leave to go to England.

735
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,440
CHAPTER ELEVEN

736
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,920
Amelia Makes a Sacrifice

737
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,560
Becky was now back in London preparing Sir 
Pitt Crawley's house for his return there.  

738
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,840
Sir Pitt knew that Rawdon 
and Becky were very poor.  

739
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,160
He was very fond of money, however, 
and did not offer his brother any.

740
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,200
Little Rawdon thought his mother was 
the most beautiful woman in the world,  

741
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,600
but he preferred spending time with his 
father, who talked to him and played  

742
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:01,040
with him. Becky usually ignored him, and made 
him eat in the kitchen when she had visitors.

743
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,080
One evening the boy was in bed when he heard 
his mother singing. Becky had a fine voice,  

744
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:13,360
and the little boy crept downstairs to listen. 
He opened the door of the drawing room so that  

745
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:18,240
he could hear better. Lord Steyne was in the 
room with his mother, and he saw the boy.  

746
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:25,280
Becky rushed out of the drawing room and smacked 
Rawdon very hard. The boy ran away to the kitchen.

747
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:36,080
'I'm not crying because she hit me,' he told the 
servants. 'But why can't I listen when she sings?  

748
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,800
She sings for that man, but 
she never sings for me!'

749
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:50,800
Rawdon and Becky had many creditors, 
but the sight of Lord Steyne's carriage  

750
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,240
outside the house every night made 
them confident that Becky was rich.  

751
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,400
They knew that Lord Steyne was 
one of the richest men in England.

752
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:05,360
As for Colonel Crawley, he felt out of place with 
the fashionable people who came to visit his wife.  

753
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:09,680
He spent most of his time playing with 
little Rawdon, or dining at one of his  

754
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:14,320
clubs with his old army friends. He saw 
very little of Becky in this period.

755
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:21,040
Trouble came to the Sedley household. The family 
had just enough money to live off from Jos,  

756
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:27,520
but old Mr Sedley began to invest the money that 
Jos sent from India. All his investments failed,  

757
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:33,360
however, and he lost the money. Mrs Sedley was 
afraid of the tradesmen who wanted to be paid.  

758
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:37,200
Amelia did not know anything about the 
financial difficulties of the household.

759
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:44,800
Just when Mrs Sedley was desperate about money, 
a letter came for Amelia from old Mr Osborne.  

760
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:51,600
He said that he wanted Georgy to come and live 
with him. He wanted to give the boy a splendid  

761
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:58,800
education, and Mr Osborne promised to leave him 
all his money when he died. He also offered to pay  

762
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:05,520
Amelia a small allowance. Amelia was offended 
by Mr Osborne's offer and she refused it.

763
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,640
The great day came for Becky when she 
was presented at Court to George IV.  

764
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,880
She attended the event with Sir 
Pitt and his wife Lady Jane.  

765
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,760
Everyone noticed that she was wearing 
some splendid diamonds for the occasion.

766
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,000
'Where did they come from, Becky?' 
Rawdon asked her in wonder.

767
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,400
'Where do you think, you silly man!' 
she said with a laugh. 'I hired them,  

768
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,600
of course. You don't suppose that all the diamonds 
that ladies wear to Court belong to them, do you?'

769
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:40,080
Becky never returned the diamonds to a shop, 
however, after her appearance at Court. She  

770
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:45,760
hid them away in her desk. The only other person 
who knew the truth about them was Lord Steyne.

771
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,280
Lord Steyne called on Becky later that day.

772
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,720
'Send that Briggs woman away,' he complained. 
'I can't come here without running into her.'

773
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,560
'I can't,' said Becky sadly.  

774
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:03,680
'I owe her money, you see. She gave me all her 
money to invest for her and I've spent it.'

775
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,640
Lord Steyne swore angrily.

776
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,920
'How much is it?' he asked angrily.

777
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,000
That evening Becky received 
a cheque from Lord Steyne.  

778
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,680
She did not pay off her debt to Briggs, 
however. She paid some of her other bills,  

779
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,960
and the rest of the money she hid 
away in the desk with the diamonds.

780
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:28,960
At last Amelia discovered the truth about her 
father's investments. The Sedleys were now  

781
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:35,280
completely ruined. The only way to save the family 
was to accept old Mr Osborne's offer to look after  

782
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,720
Georgy. The boy himself was quite excited at the 
idea of going to live with his rich relatives.  

783
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:47,040
He did not realise how much his mother 
suffered at the change. It nearly broke  

784
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:52,880
her heart to see the boy go off to his new 
home, but there was nothing else she could do.

785
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,120
CHAPTER TWELVE

786
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,760
Imprisonment and Violence

787
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:09,280
Little Rawdon had been sent off to an expensive 
school paid for by his Lordship, and Briggs had  

788
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:15,040
been found another job. Lord Steyne often passed 
the evening with Becky and Rawdon at their house.

789
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,000
One night Becky and Rawdon went 
to a party at Lord Steyne's house.  

790
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:26,240
Rawdon stayed behind after his wife left, to smoke 
a cigar with Lord Steyne's assistant, Wenham.

791
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:32,240
The two men strolled through the streets 
together. Suddenly they were joined by  

792
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:38,000
three other men, one of whom touched Rawdon on 
the shoulder. He knew immediately what it was.

793
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,280
These men had come to arrest him for debt.

794
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,720
'Lend me a hundred, Wenham,' Rawdon asked.

795
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,600
'I haven't got any money,' Wenham replied.

796
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:53,520
The men took Rawdon off to prison. He was not 
worried, as he was sure that Becky had money  

797
01:06:53,520 --> 01:07:00,320
to save him. He wrote her a note explaining 
what had happened. Then he lay down to sleep.

798
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:06,480
He waited all the next day for some message from 
Becky. At last a letter arrived in the evening.  

799
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,840
Becky said she was ill in bed, but that 
Lord Steyne had some money to send him.  

800
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,360
Rawdon blushed as he read his wife's letter. He 
remembered that he had been walking with Lord  

801
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:22,000
Steyne's assistant when the men arrested him. 
Had there been a plot to get him out of the way?  

802
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:28,320
He wrote to Sir Pitt Crawley now, and in an hour 
Lady Jane arrived with the money that he needed.  

803
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:34,800
Rawdon was ashamed. He realised that Lady Jane 
was kind, and he wanted to change his life.

804
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:41,360
Rawdon hurried home. He was surprised to see 
that the drawing room was lit up, when Becky  

805
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:46,240
had told him she was ill. He entered the house 
quietly and approached the drawing-room door.  

806
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,640
He could hear Becky singing. 
When he opened the door  

807
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:57,280
he saw that there were only two people in the 
room, Becky and Lord Steyne. He saw that Becky  

808
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,120
was wearing the splendid diamonds that were 
supposed to have been hired and returned.

809
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,440
Becky looked up in horror as she saw her husband.

810
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,080
'I'm innocent, Rawdon,' she cried. 
'You must believe me, I'm innocent!'

811
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:15,600
Lord Steyne, meanwhile, thought that Rawdon and 
Becky had planned to trap him. He was furious.

812
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:20,240
'Innocent, you!' he shouted at Becky. 
'I've given you thousands of pounds  

813
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:24,160
that you and this man have spent 
together. Don't try to fool me.'

814
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,960
Rawdon hit Lord Steyne, who fell to the floor. 
Then he made Becky remove all of her jewellery,  

815
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,880
and he hurled it at the frightened 
nobleman. One of the pieces struck  

816
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,440
Lord Steyne on the forehead. It left a scar 
that he carried for the rest of his life.

817
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,360
Now Rawdon made Becky open her desk. He 
saw that there was a lot of money inside,  

818
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,200
including the cheque from Lord Steyne.

819
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:52,000
'I'll send this back to him in the 
morning,' he told her grimly. 'You  

820
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,920
might have got me out of prison,' he told 
her sadly. 'I always shared with you.'

821
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:00,880
Then Rawdon left the house. Becky 
understood that he was gone forever.  

822
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,680
All her plans had come to nothing.

823
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,080
Rawdon was determined to 
fight a duel with Lord Steyne.  

824
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:13,600
First he went to see Sir Pitt to ask him to 
look after his son if anything happened to him.  

825
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,360
Then he went to his club to ask one of 
his officer friends to arrange the duel.

826
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,680
Later that day Becky came to see Sir Pitt 
Crawley. Sir Pitt had seen something in  

827
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:28,320
that morning's newspaper that he wanted to 
discuss with her. There was an article saying  

828
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:32,880
that Colonel Rawdon Crawley was expected to 
be appointed Governor of Coventry Island.

829
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,440
'It's true,' Becky told him. 
'Lord Steyne organised it for him.  

830
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,480
Don't you see, Pitt, everything I 
did was for Rawdon. I'm innocent!'

831
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:48,160
Lady Jane was not happy to see Becky. 
She asked her to leave the house.

832
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:53,760
Rawdon's army friend had also seen the 
newspaper article and he showed it to Rawdon.  

833
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,840
Wenham walked into the club.

834
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,880
'You're making a terrible mistake, 
Crawley,' Wenham said. 'It was only  

835
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,840
by chance that your wife and Lord Steyne 
were alone in the house that evening.  

836
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,960
My wife and I had also been invited, but we 
couldn't come because Mrs Wenham had a headache.'

837
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:15,360
Rawdon did not believe Wenham's story, but 
he saw that he could not fight Lord Steyne  

838
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,880
now in the light of Wenham's evidence.

839
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:23,280
He thought very carefully about what he should do. 
In the end he decided to accept the Governorship  

840
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,840
of Coventry Island. He wrote very regularly 
to little Rawdon from there, but he never  

841
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:34,000
contacted his wife again. Little Rawdon spent 
his school holidays with Sir Pitt and Lady Jane.

842
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:41,040
Becky herself was now ruined. Her servants 
and creditors all demanded to be paid,  

843
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:47,040
and Mr Raggles took his house back. He 
was ruined as well. Thus Vanity Fair  

844
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:51,360
makes other people pay for its 
pleasures. Becky fled the country.

845
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,160
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

846
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,160
Final Destinies

847
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,280
Major Dobbin came as quickly as he could 
back to England. He met Jos on the journey,  

848
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:13,200
and they travelled together. Jos told Dobbin 
that Amelia had not mentioned any plan to marry,  

849
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,840
and this news cheered the Major up considerably.

850
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:21,520
Dobbin hurried to Amelia's house as soon as 
he arrived in England. There he learned that  

851
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:27,760
Mrs Sedley had died, and that Georgy was now 
living with Mr Osborne. Georgy was happy in the  

852
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:33,200
old man's house. He did not think often about 
his mother. He did not understand her pain.

853
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:39,680
Mr Sedley died soon after Dobbin's arrival 
in the country, and Dobbin was now George's  

854
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:44,320
guardian. He had to pay a visit to Mr 
Osborne to discuss the boy's futures.  

855
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:50,080
Old Mr Osborne had looked through his son's 
papers, and he now realised that Dobbin had  

856
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:55,200
been sending Amelia money for years. He 
asked Dobbin to explain what had happened.

857
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:02,000
'Well, sir,' Dobbin told him, 'the marriage was 
very much my doing. I thought George had gone too  

858
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,320
far to let Amelia down. And so, when she was left 
without money, I did what I could to help her.'

859
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,360
Mr Osborne turned very red in the face.

860
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:17,360
'You did me a great injury,' he said. 'But you're 
an honest man, sir. Let me shake your hand.'

861
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:23,200
Dobbin did everything he could to make peace 
between the Sedley and the Osborne families.

862
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,400
'It's true that Amelia took your son away 
from you,' he said once to Mr Osborne,  

863
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,040
'but you have also taken her son away from her.'

864
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:36,400
Finally Mr Osborne's hatred for 
the Sedleys began to fade away.  

865
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:42,800
He made a new will, leaving some money 
to Amelia as well as Georgy. He never  

866
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,760
met Amelia again, however, because he 
died suddenly after a heart attack.

867
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,240
Dobbin, meanwhile, had told 
Amelia that he loved her,  

868
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,200
but all she offered him was 
her friendship and gratitude.

869
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,560
Jos, Amelia, Dobbin and Georgy now 
went on a tour of Europe together.  

870
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:06,000
They stopped at a large town in Germany, 
and Jos went off - to play roulette.  

871
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,280
He was very surprised to be greeted 
by the woman sitting next to him.

872
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,440
'Mrs Crawley!' he gasped in astonishment.

873
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,840
'Call me Becky,' she replied 
softly. 'You always used to.'

874
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,680
Becky now used all her charm on the gullible Jos.  

875
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:27,360
She told him that she was very poor now, and 
that she had enemies who made her life miserable.

876
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,360
Jos told Dobbin that he had met Becky.

877
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:35,280
'Her again!' Dobbin exclaimed. 
'She causes trouble everywhere.'

878
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:42,000
Amelia did not want to see Becky at first, 
but at last Jos persuaded her. He told her  

879
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,440
that Becky was very unhappy. The meeting 
went well, and Jos and Amelia invited  

880
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:52,880
Becky to come and stay in their hotel. 
For once Dobbin was angry with Amelia.

881
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,040
'Don't let her come,' he advised her. 
'She wasn't always your friend, Amelia.'

882
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:02,400
Amelia was suddenly very angry with 
Dobbin. She remembered how unhappy she  

883
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,320
had been when her husband had abandoned 
her at the ball to dance with Becky.

884
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,560
'That was cruel of you!' she cried.

885
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:15,200
The next day Dobbin apologised for his remark. 
He said that he had heard bad things about Becky.  

886
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,440
Amelia did not forgive him.

887
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:23,440
'I've loved you for many years,' he told 
her bitterly. 'Now I see that you were not  

888
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:28,880
worth the devotion I have spent on you. You can 
cherish memories, but you cannot love as I do.  

889
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:34,960
It's not your fault, but I have decided: 
I'm going away. I shan't ever come back.'

890
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,880
Becky overheard the argument 
between Amelia and Dobbin.

891
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,880
'She's a fool,' she thought. 'That man loves her.'

892
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,240
Dobbin left the town and returned to England.

893
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:51,200
The days went by, and Jos and 
Becky spent more time together.

894
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,640
Amelia and Georgy missed Dobbin terribly.  

895
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,360
Amelia wrote to him, but she did not 
tell anyone that she had done so.

896
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,440
'You must go away from here,' Becky told Amelia.  

897
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,680
'You must go away and marry again. 
You must accept your faithful friend.'

898
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,520
'I shall never marry again,' 
Amelia told her. 'I have tried,  

899
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:16,480
but I can't forget George. He 
was the only man in my life.'

900
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:23,840
Becky gave her friend an old letter. Amelia was 
astonished to recognise George's handwriting.  

901
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,640
It was the letter he had put among Becky's 
flowers the night of the dance in Brussels.  

902
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,600
He had asked Becky to run away with him.

903
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:38,720
At first Amelia cried when she thought about her 
faithless husband. Then she began to remember  

904
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:44,160
Dobbin and his constant love for her. She 
realised that she was free to love Dobbin now!

905
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:51,840
Soon Amelia and Dobbin were happily married in 
England. At last Dobbin had married his true love.  

906
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:57,920
They went to live near Sir Pitt and Lady 
Jane. The two families became great friends.

907
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,920
Jos remained in Europe with Becky. 
There were rumours that Jos was ill,  

908
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,800
and that he had taken out a huge 
insurance policy on his life.  

909
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:11,840
Amelia was worried about her brother, and 
asked Dobbin to find out what was happening.

910
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,600
Dobbin discovered that Jos and Becky 
were in Brussels. He managed to see  

911
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:23,520
Jos without Becky knowing about his visit. 
Jos looked unwell and he seemed frightened.

912
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,760
'Don't let Becky know you've been here,' 
he begged Dobbin. 'I'm afraid of her.'

913
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,040
'Come away with me now,' Dobbin suggested.

914
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:36,160
But it was no good. Jos could 
not bring himself to leave Becky.

915
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:43,520
Three months later Jos was dead. 
The circumstances were suspicious,  

916
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:49,840
and at first the insurance company refused to pay 
the sum due on his life policy. The company had  

917
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:56,080
no evidence that Jos's death was due to unnatural 
causes, however. In the end they paid the money.

918
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:03,840
Becky, who now called herself 'Lady Crawley', 
settled in England once more. Her husband Rawdon  

919
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:09,120
died of yellow fever on Coventry Island, six 
weeks before the death of his older brother  

920
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:17,840
Sir Pitt Crawley. The whole Crawley estate thus 
came to Becky's son who became Sir Rawdon Crawley.  

921
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:23,200
He always refused to see his mother, 
but he made her a generous allowance.

922
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:30,400
Amelia and Dobbin saw Becky once again when 
they were in London with their children. Becky  

923
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:35,920
smiled as Dobbin and Amelia grabbed their 
children and walked quickly away from her.
 
 

924
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:36,445
- THE END -
