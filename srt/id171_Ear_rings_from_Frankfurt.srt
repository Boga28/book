00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,069
CHAPTER ONE
A night out at Maxim's

2
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:10,470
Jennifer looked at the clock on the waiting-room
wall.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,990
Nearly half-past eight.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,280
The light was still on in Doctor Gibson's
room.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,040
I'm going to be late, she said to herself,
why doesn't he hurry up?

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:35,620
The evening surgery was always busy on Thursdays
but tonight was worse than usual.

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,730
She quickly put the newspapers in a cupboard.

8
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,890
Then she took off her white coat and locked
it in the cupboard too.

9
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,790
She was turning off the lights when someone
rang the front doorbell.

10
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:58,989
Oh no, not another patient, not at this hour.

11
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:03,750
She ran to the door and opened it.

12
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:11,640
Outside it was dark but she could see a man,
his hands deep in his pockets.

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,509
He moved his head and the light fell on his
face.

14
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,479
'Richard!'

15
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,299
she cried in surprise.

16
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:26,060
'What are you doing here?'

17
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,039
'Can I come in for a minute?'

18
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:37,119
He did not wait for an answer but pushed past
her and went inside.

19
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,869
Jennifer turned to him.

20
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,670
She was usually pleased when Richard called,
but this was the wrong time.

21
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,719
'I'm sorry, but you can't stay.

22
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,439
I must hurry.

23
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,329
I'm meeting my friend Claire for dinner and...'

24
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:57,409
She stopped.

25
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:04,030
It was Richard's eyes - they looked tired
and worried.

26
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,889
'What's the matter?'

27
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:08,190
she asked.

28
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,750
Just then Dr Gibson called from his room.

29
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,739
'Did I hear the doorbell, Nurse?

30
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:18,280
Was it another patient?'

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:25,510
'No, it's only my brother Richard,' she called
back.

32
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,900
She turned back to Richard.

33
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,780
'Is something wrong?'

34
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,090
she asked again.

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,730
He shook his head.

36
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,260
'I'm fine,' he said.

37
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,620
'It's just...

38
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,530
well, I had some trouble at work.'

39
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,580
'Trouble?'

40
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,760
'It was nothing, really.

41
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,989
I said something to my boss and he didn't
like it.

42
00:02:53,989 --> 00:03:01,380
He got angry with me and... and in the end
he told me to go.

43
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,140
So I've lost my job.'

44
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,650
'Oh Richard, not again!

45
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,489
Why do you do these things?'

46
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,260
Jennifer was beginning to feel cross with
him.

47
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,540
'And now you have no money, is that it?'

48
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,250
'Take it easy, Jenny.

49
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,462
I don't need very much.

50
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:25,620
Only twenty pounds.

51
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,870
I'll pay you back next week - really I will.'

52
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,120
He put his hand on her arm.

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,659
'You can do that for me, can't you?

54
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,110
Just twenty pounds.

55
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,740
It's for a present.'

56
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,850
'Yes, I know, I know.

57
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,590
A present for a very special girl - like the
last one.

58
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,440
And the one before.'

59
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,370
Jennifer knew her young brother well and she
was often angry with him, but she could never

60
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,090
say no to him.

61
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,629
She opened her bag, took out some money and
gave it to him.

62
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:16,430
'But remember, I want it back next week.'

63
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,930
Richard smiled and put his arm around his
sister.

64
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,570
'Thanks, Jenny.

65
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,040
This is different.

66
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Really!

67
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,240
She's very, very special.

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,480
But you're in a hurry so I'll go now.'

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,250
'Don't forget,' she called after him.

70
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,920
'Next week.

71
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,590
Twenty pounds.'

72
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:48,950
Maxim's restaurant was busy - young men and
women from offices, several older people,

73
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:55,010
a group of students, and a few theatre people.

74
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,250
Jennifer looked around for her friend.

75
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:05,120
Claire usually sat near the window but tonight
she was not there.

76
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,920
Somebody was having a party and all the tables
on that side were full.

77
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,330
Then Jennifer heard Claire's voice behind
her.

78
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,250
'Did you get lost?

79
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,900
I've been here for hours.'

80
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:28,050
'I know I'm late,' Jennifer said, 'and I am
sorry.

81
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,130
Today has been really busy.

82
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,330
The last patient didn't leave until eight-thirty.

83
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,760
And then I had a visit from Richard.

84
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,360
He wanted to borrow some money.

85
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,700
He always wants to borrow money.'

86
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,720
They went to an empty table.

87
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,030
A waiter came up to them and took their orders.

88
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:01,120
At that moment there was a cheer from the
party beside the window.

89
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,050
An older man in a light grey suit was standing
up.

90
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:12,150
He spoke for a few minutes and then held up
his glass.

91
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:18,990
All the others stood up, and looked at a young
girl with large gold ear-rings, who was sitting

92
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,410
in the chair next to him.

93
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:29,190
Everyone was laughing, and then they began
to sing 'Happy birthday to you'.

94
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:37,150
They were all looking at the girl, but she
herself just sat there without a smile on

95
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,430
her face.

96
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:48,710
The song came to an end, and there was another
loud cheer and more laughing and shouting.

97
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:57,550
Someone called out 'Twenty-one today, twenty-one
today...', and this time everyone in the restaurant

98
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,810
sang too.

99
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,020
Suddenly there was a loud crash.

100
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:13,190
Then someone screamed and a voice shouted,
'Bring a towel - quickly.'

101
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,390
The man in the grey suit was lying across
the table.

102
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,390
He was holding his face, which was red with
blood.

103
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:28,550
On the table there was broken glass.

104
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:35,300
Someone said in a loud voice, 'What happened
- did he fall?'

105
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,770
Several people were speaking at the same time.

106
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,810
'It's his heart, you know...'

107
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,330
'Joe's been in and out of hospital for years...'

108
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,750
'His head hit those glasses'.

109
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,840
The man was still lying across the table.

110
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,360
Jennifer jumped up, and both she and Claire
ran over to him.

111
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,420
'We're nurses,' said Jennifer.

112
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,900
'Can we help?'

113
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,120
There was a cut on the side of the man's face.

114
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,720
It was deep and he was losing a lot of blood.

115
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,960
A waiter ran up with a towel.

116
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,060
Jennifer took it and held it to the cut.

117
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:30,460
The man's mouth was open and he was making
strange noises.

118
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,740
'He needs a doctor.

119
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,020
We'll have to get him to hospital,' Jennifer
said.

120
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,250
She turned to Claire.

121
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,970
'You came here in your car, didn't you?'

122
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:52,080
'Yes, come on - we'll take him,' Claire replied.

123
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,370
They helped the man outside and put him in
Claire's car.

124
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,560
Jennifer jumped in beside him and they drove
off.

125
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,150
She was still holding the towel to the man's
face.

126
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:15,440
The blood was not coming so fast now and he
was beginning to feel a little better.

127
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,700
'Where... where are we going?' he asked.

128
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,340
'Are you taking me home?'

129
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:32,060
'Just stay there and don't speak,' Jennifer
told him.

130
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,250
'You fell and hurt yourself.

131
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,060
You'll be all right, but you must see a doctor.

132
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,550
We'll be at the hospital in a few minutes.'

133
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:52,220
At the word 'hospital' the man immediately
tried to sit up.

134
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:59,950
'No, no,' he said angrily, 'I don't need to
go to hospital.

135
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,270
I'm feeling better now.

136
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,590
Just take me home.

137
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,360
And who are you?'

138
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,320
'I'm a nurse,' Jennifer told him.

139
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,320
'And you need to see a doctor.

140
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,010
We're nearly there now.

141
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,150
Just sit still - and stop talking.'

142
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:30,490
But the man was feeling stronger now and he
would not be quiet.

143
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,290
He pulled at Jennifer's arm and said loudly,
'I don't need a doctor.

144
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,010
It's just a small cut on my face.

145
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,220
I'm all right now.

146
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,779
Take me home!'

147
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:51,370
When Jennifer did not answer him, he said
in a quieter voice.

148
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,770
'Come on now - listen to me.

149
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,420
I'm feeling fine, really I am.

150
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,720
There's no need to take me to hospital.

151
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,970
They'll want to keep me there - they always
do, because of my bad heart.

152
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:19,120
You see, I have to meet some business people
the day after tomorrow - it's very important.

153
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,700
So just stop the car and I can get a taxi
home.'

154
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,400
By now the car was at the door of the hospital.

155
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:37,900
A nurse came to meet them and while Claire
told her about the accident, Jennifer helped

156
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,550
the man out of the car.

157
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:49,000
He said something angrily to the nurse, but
after a few seconds he went with her into

158
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,680
the hospital.

159
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,930
Jennifer and Claire drove away.

160
00:11:53,930 --> 00:12:00,020
'What a difficult man!' said Claire crossly.

161
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:06,980
'No "Thank you for your help" or "You're very
kind".'

162
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:13,060
'Some people never say thank you,' Jennifer
said.

163
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,970
'Don't worry about it.'

164
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:23,360
When they got back to Maxim's, a police car
was standing outside, with its blue light

165
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,290
on.

166
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,740
There was a small group of people around the
door.

167
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,310
Jennifer pushed through them, Claire behind
her.

168
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,760
They tried to go inside.

169
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,810
A policeman moved forward and put up his arm.

170
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,350
'You'll have to wait here,' he told them.

171
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:54,880
'But we ordered dinner... and we haven't eaten
yet,' said Claire.

172
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,350
But the policeman was not listening to them.

173
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,910
He was looking through the glass door.

174
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:11,839
Something was happening inside and people
were moving about.

175
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,950
Then one of Maxim's waiters opened the door
and two policemen came out.

176
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,220
They were holding a young girl between them.

177
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:32,600
It was the girl from the birthday party, the
girl with the unhappy face and the expensive

178
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,740
gold ear-rings.

179
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:44,640
The police pushed her into the back of their
car and drove away quickly.

180
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,180
Jennifer and Claire looked at each other.

181
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,700
What an evening!

182
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:58,839
They waited two or three minutes, but the
restaurant door was closed now and the policeman

183
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,980
was standing in front of it again.

184
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,200
Neither of them felt hungry anymore.

185
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,149
They walked slowly towards the car.

186
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,940
Claire was the first to speak.

187
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:23,200
'Come on, Jenny, let's enjoy ourselves - we're
having a night out.'

188
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,240
Jennifer did not speak.

189
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:34,580
Claire went on, 'Do you remember Maxim's little
song on TV?'

190
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,860
She began to sing:

191
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,839
Come where the music's wonderful,

192
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,779
Come where the food is fine.

193
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,490
Let's all meet at Maxim's,

194
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,420
We'll have a wonderful time.

195
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,700
She stopped.

196
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,920
Jennifer was not pleased.

197
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,960
'All this is not really my idea of a wonderful
time,' she said.

198
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:11,300
'I'm tired and I wanted a nice quiet evening,
a good meal, and an early night.'

199
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,210
'Come on,' Claire replied.

200
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,810
'Let's go to another restaurant.'

201
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:22,010
'No, let's leave it till next week.

202
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,140
I'll just walk home now.'

203
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,750
They said goodbye.

204
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:35,670
Claire got into her car and called, 'See you
next week, then.'

205
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,580
Jennifer walked slowly home.

206
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:46,270
She felt unhappy and worried - worried about
her young brother, Richard.

207
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:51,080
She remembered his visit to the surgery earlier
that evening.

208
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,649
He was always in and out of jobs, and never
had any money.

209
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:04,550
A year ago he had a little trouble with the
police, but Richard did not worry about it.

210
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,930
He never worried about anything!

211
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:13,029
He just laughed, and came to Jennifer to ask
for more money.

212
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:18,510
Both their parents were dead, and there were
no other brothers or sisters.

213
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:28,640
So Jennifer, fifteen years older than Richard,
worried about her brother a lot.

214
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:35,310
She went past a jewellery shop with its lights
on, and stopped to look in the window for

215
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,720
a minute.

216
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:46,820
She saw some ear-rings and then remembered
the gold ear-rings on the girl at Maxim's.

217
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:54,720
They were large and looked very expensive
- and they looked all wrong next to that small

218
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,240
unhappy face.

219
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,800
Where did she get them?

220
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,530
Jennifer smiled to herself.

221
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:13,129
Perhaps the police were asking that question
now.

222
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:20,059
CHAPTER TWO
A visit from the police

223
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,079
Jennifer did not sleep well that night.

224
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,950
She woke up feeling tired and unhappy.

225
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:35,610
When she arrived at Dr Gibson's surgery, she
looked into the waiting-room.

226
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,590
It was nearly full.

227
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:44,159
Another busy morning, she said to herself.

228
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:48,950
Just then she heard the doctor's car outside.

229
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,860
He hurried in and went into his room.

230
00:17:53,860 --> 00:18:00,250
Three hours later he finished with his last
patient.

231
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:06,440
Jennifer brought a cup of coffee and put it
on Dr Gibson's desk.

232
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,299
He said thanks and she turned to go.

233
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:19,799
'Er - just a minute,' he called after her,
'I want a word with you.'

234
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,100
He sounded a little cross.

235
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:31,009
'There was a phone call for you this morning
- about an hour ago.

236
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:36,320
You were busy at the time so I answered it.'

237
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,059
'Oh, who was it?'

238
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,960
'Let me see - I wrote it down somewhere.'

239
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,730
He began to move the papers on his desk.

240
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,749
'She said that she was a friend of your brother's.'

241
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:53,669
'My brother?

242
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:57,200
But why did she want me?'

243
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,129
'Ah, here it is.'

244
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:04,530
He gave Jennifer a piece of paper.

245
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,230
On it was a name - Wendy.

246
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,549
'She didn't leave a number.

247
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:16,149
She'll call you again at home.'

248
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:17,869
Jennifer looked at the name.

249
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:18,869
Wendy?...

250
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:22,570
Wendy who?

251
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,970
she asked herself.

252
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,540
'Thank you, Dr Gibson,' she said.

253
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:36,539
'And tell her, please, no phone calls during
surgery hours.'

254
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:37,739
'I'm sorry.

255
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:41,409
It won't happen again.'

256
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:47,940
Jennifer wanted to explain that she did not
know this Wendy but decided not to.

257
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:57,489
A few minutes later Dr Gibson shouted goodbye
to her and Jennifer was alone.

258
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:02,799
She knew a few of Richard's friends but nobody
called Wendy.

259
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:09,570
But Richard changed his girlfriends as often
as his shirts!

260
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,120
Jennifer did not try to remember all their
names.

261
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:22,480
At the end of the day Jennifer arrived at
her flat and was going up the stairs when

262
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,460
she heard voices above.

263
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:31,389
Two men were standing outside her door.

264
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:33,899
One of them came up to her.

265
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,450
'Miss Walton?' he asked.

266
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,129
'My name's Detective Barrett.

267
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:44,200
I'd like to ask you a few questions, please.

268
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,940
Can we come in?'

269
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:52,779
She turned the key in the lock and pushed
open the door, and all three of them went

270
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:55,000
inside and sat down.

271
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,539
'It's about Mr Richard Walton.

272
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:04,600
He's your brother, I think,' Barrett began.

273
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:15,020
He spoke softly but he had a hard voice, cold
and unfriendly, and his light blue eyes never

274
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,359
left Jennifer's face.

275
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:22,779
'When did you last see him?'

276
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:24,990
Jennifer told him.

277
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:30,340
'And before that?'

278
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,450
'I'm not sure - about three or four weeks
ago.'

279
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:40,230
Those light blue eyes were still on her.

280
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,279
She was beginning to feel uncomfortable.

281
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:49,970
'You didn't see him last weekend, then?'

282
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,360
'No.'

283
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,419
'Try to remember - did he come here last Saturday?

284
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,269
In the evening?'

285
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:01,730
'No.'

286
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,639
'You're sure?'

287
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:08,190
'Yes, of course I'm sure.'

288
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,429
Barrett's voice became a little louder.

289
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:15,919
'You didn't meet him in some other place?

290
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,269
At the airport perhaps?'

291
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:20,919
'No, I didn't.

292
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,769
I haven't seen him for nearly a month, I tell
you.

293
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:28,470
Until last night, I mean.'

294
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,490
'Last night...'

295
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,640
Barrett said after her.

296
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,450
'Tell us more about last night.

297
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:42,970
You took a man to hospital... from Maxim's
restaurant.'

298
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,970
'Yes.'

299
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,679
'A friend of yours?'

300
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,030
'I never saw him in my life before.

301
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,789
He fell and hurt himself.

302
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:59,600
They said that he had a bad heart so I went
to the hospital with him.

303
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,710
That's all.'

304
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,989
'You never saw him before?

305
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:09,119
You surprise me, Miss Walton.'

306
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,480
Barrett was watching her carefully.

307
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,230
'You didn't know that he was Mr Joe Kelly,
your brother's boss?'

308
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,889
'No, I didn't.'

309
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:21,889
'Really?

310
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:24,980
You didn't know him?

311
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,149
Very strange, don't you think?'

312
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:33,919
All these questions - she was feeling angry
now.

313
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,610
She stood up and went across to Barrett.

314
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,619
'Look, Detective Barrett, I'm getting tired
of this.

315
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:46,979
What's it all about?

316
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:52,590
You want me to answer your questions and you
don't tell me why.

317
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,600
What's the matter - I want to know.

318
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,700
Is Richard in trouble?'

319
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,259
Barrett held up his hands.

320
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:04,330
'All right, take it easy.'

321
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:13,880
He gave a little smile but his eyes were cold
and he was still looking hard at Jennifer.

322
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,009
The other detective said some-thing quietly
to Barrett.

323
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:26,850
Then Barrett went on, 'Your brother - what
do you know about his girlfriend?'

324
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,669
'His girlfriend?'

325
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:32,490
'Yes, Wendy.

326
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,450
He works with her at Joe Kelly's.'

327
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,559
Wendy!

328
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,639
The mystery telephone call at the surgery
that morning!

329
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:47,210
Jennifer tried to hide her surprise.

330
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,759
She looked first at Barrett, then at the other
man.

331
00:24:51,759 --> 00:25:01,220
Then she said coldly, 'Richard doesn't talk
to me about his girlfriends.'

332
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,480
'He's told you about Wendy, I'm sure.

333
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,159
They're very friendly, the two of them.

334
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,059
They went to Germany together.'

335
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:13,669
He turned to the other man.

336
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:17,779
'Last weekend, wasn't it?'

337
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:23,980
The second detective moved a little nearer
and spoke quietly to Barrett.

338
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,359
'She doesn't know anything about this.

339
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,929
You'll have to explain it to her.'

340
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:34,279
Barrett turned to Jennifer again.

341
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,549
'We're looking for some stolen jewellery,
from Germany.

342
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:43,720
And we believe that your brother knows something
about it.

343
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:52,750
You won't like this, Miss Walton, but your
brother works for a criminal, a thief, and

344
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,610
one of these days he's going to find himself
in trouble.'

345
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,230
'But my brother lost his job yesterday.

346
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,720
He told me last night.

347
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,350
So he doesn't work for this man anymore.'

348
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:11,299
Barrett smiled.

349
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:19,049
'Perhaps he doesn't... or perhaps he wants
people to think that he doesn't work for Kelly.'

350
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:20,100
He went on.

351
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:27,960
'If you don't want to see your brother in
prison, tell him to keep away from Kelly.

352
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,720
And from beautiful young girls like Wendy.'

353
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,510
Jennifer looked at him and said nothing.

354
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,230
Barrett stood up.

355
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,909
He looked at the other man and they both moved
to the door.

356
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:50,159
Jennifer followed and opened it for them.

357
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,159
'Good night, Miss Walton.

358
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,229
Thanks for your help.'

359
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:01,710
They walked to the top of the stairs.

360
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:07,929
Jennifer waited for a few seconds, then went
inside and closed the door.

361
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:11,149
Oh Richard, she thought.

362
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:13,149
What is happening?

363
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:16,389
What are you doing?

364
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:21,700
Why can't you stay out of trouble?

365
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,879
She telephoned Richard's flat, but there was
no answer.

366
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:32,909
So she went to bed, and worried half the night
about her young brother.

367
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:39,389
The next day, Saturday, she worked only in
the morning.

368
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:46,850
When Dr Gibson's surgery finished, she went
home to have lunch.

369
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,749
Then she planned to go round to Richard's
flat and talk to him.

370
00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:57,909
But when she got into her flat, the telephone
was ringing.

371
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,440
She ran across the room and answered it.

372
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,899
'Hello, is that Jennifer Walton?'

373
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:07,120
someone asked.

374
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,789
It was a girl's voice.

375
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,809
'Yes, Jennifer here.

376
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:13,769
Who's speaking?'

377
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:22,239
The caller was silent for a second or two,
then said, 'You don't know me, but I'm a friend

378
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:23,779
of your brother's.

379
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:26,129
Are you free just now?

380
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:29,279
I need to see you.

381
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,909
It's important.'

382
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,370
She went on quickly.

383
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,669
'I'm just round the corner from your flat.

384
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:38,159
Can I come up?

385
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,299
I'll be there in three minutes.'

386
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:45,570
And she put the phone down.

387
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,259
Jennifer was waiting at the door when her
visitor arrived.

388
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:53,010
She looked at her in surprise.

389
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,529
She knew that face.

390
00:28:54,529 --> 00:29:02,500
It was the young girl from Maxim's, but without
the gold ear-rings today.

391
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,809
The girl was also surprised.

392
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:11,750
'I saw you at Maxim's on Thursday night,'
she said.

393
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,169
'You took Joe Kelly to hospital.

394
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:19,679
Are you Jennifer, Richard's sister?'

395
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,809
'Yes,' said Jennifer.

396
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:27,979
She looked at her visitor, and began to put
two and two together.

397
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:31,739
'And you must be Wendy.'

398
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:36,120
'Yes,' the girl said.

399
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,580
Jennifer stood back, and the girl went inside.

400
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:47,349
They sat down and Jennifer looked at the girl
coldly.

401
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:51,090
So this was Richard's girlfriend...

402
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:55,470
who worked for the criminal, Joe Kelly.

403
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:02,590
She had a beautiful little face and looked
very unhappy, but Jennifer did not want to

404
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,399
like her.

405
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,210
'What do you want to see me about?'

406
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,340
she asked.

407
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:15,479
'It's difficult to explain,' the girl began.

408
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:19,389
She looked unhappily at Jennifer's unfriendly
face.

409
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:24,509
'You see, Richard has told me about you.

410
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:29,229
He says that you're very kind... you always
help him.

411
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:34,450
He gave me your phone numbers and said...'

412
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,559
She stopped, and Jennifer waited.

413
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:43,830
'He said that I could ask you for help.'

414
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,580
Jennifer smiled to herself.

415
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,340
Always the kind big sister, she thought.

416
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,870
She looked at the girl's small, worried face.

417
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:58,769
'Well, go on, then,' she said more kindly.

418
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:01,809
'Tell me all about it.

419
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:04,789
I hope that Richard's not in trouble.'

420
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:12,409
'You see, I work for Joe Kelly,' Wendy began.

421
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:18,039
She talked for a long time, and Jennifer listened
carefully.

422
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:24,190
This was Wendy's story.

423
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,149
CHAPTER THREE
Wendy's story

424
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:35,200
Kelly is not a nice man, and I've never liked
him.

425
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,639
I've worked for him for a year now.

426
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:48,149
My father got the job for me - he told me
to work hard and not to ask questions.

427
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:56,249
Kelly often gets angry, and when he's angry,
he shouts at everyone and his face goes very

428
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:58,229
red.

429
00:31:58,229 --> 00:32:03,690
I'm afraid of him, but I don't want to lose
my job.

430
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:10,490
I need the money and it's not easy to find
another job.

431
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:13,929
Richard started work at Kelly's about a month
ago.

432
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:21,029
We're good friends, but we don't talk much
about our jobs.

433
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:24,859
Nobody at Kelly's talks about the work.

434
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,759
We don't really know what his business is.

435
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:36,129
He has two garages in the town and he buys
and sells old cars.

436
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:45,879
But he also buys and sells a lot of other
things, too - furniture, old pictures, jewellery.

437
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:53,019
I think that some of these things are stolen,
but I don't ask questions.

438
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:57,710
Ten days ago Kelly called me into his office.

439
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,629
I stood there and waited.

440
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:10,590
He began to say something to me, but he stopped
and looked down at his papers.

441
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,700
Then he took out his diary and opened it.

442
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,739
'Wendy, what are you doing next weekend?'

443
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:21,590
'I'm not sure, Mr Kelly.'

444
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:26,200
'How would you like to go on a little business
trip?

445
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,789
I'll pay you for it, of course.'

446
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:33,659
This surprised me, and I did not reply immediately.

447
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:38,989
Then I said, 'A business trip, Mr Kelly?'

448
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:42,409
'Yes, to Germany...

449
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:44,599
just for the day.

450
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,489
It isn't a difficult job but it's important.

451
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:50,259
What do you say?'

452
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:57,580
I did not know much about Mr Kelly's business,
but I did know that there was something strange

453
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,369
about these journeys to other countries.

454
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:07,519
They happened every two or three months, and
after them there were secret meetings in the

455
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,720
office, often late in the evening.

456
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,779
I decided that I did not want to go.

457
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:19,909
'But... but I've never been to Germany.

458
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:22,280
Don't you think...

459
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,829
well, perhaps you can ask one of the others.'

460
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:30,450
'I'm asking you, Wendy.

461
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:36,579
I said that it was important and I want you
to do it.'

462
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:41,190
I began to say something but he was still
speaking.

463
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:47,970
'I have friends in Frankfurt and they want
to send me some things.

464
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:56,210
They'll give you three small boxes, like egg
boxes, and you'll bring them back here.

465
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,829
There's nothing difficult about that, is there?'

466
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:02,789
I didn't say anything.

467
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:07,430
'Are you listening to me, Wendy?' he asked.

468
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:12,050
'I need you to do this job for me.'

469
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,089
His voice was getting louder now.

470
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:17,529
I looked him in the face.

471
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:19,010
'I'm...

472
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,650
I'm sorry, Mr Kelly.

473
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,799
I've just remembered.

474
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:25,580
I'm busy next weekend.

475
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,280
I can't do it.'

476
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,760
He jumped up and his chair fell back.

477
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,440
'Now, just you listen to me, young woman.

478
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,480
You work for me, remember that.

479
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,110
I'm the person who pays you.'

480
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,770
He caught my arm and shook me.

481
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:51,040
This time I'm telling you, not asking you.

482
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,720
You'll go to Frankfurt or there'll be trouble.

483
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:02,690
You will leave on the first plane on Saturday
morning and come back the same evening.

484
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,599
With the three boxes.

485
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,130
And don't say a word to anyone, do you understand?'

486
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,849
Then he walked out.

487
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:17,210
I didn't sleep much that night.

488
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,359
Or the next.

489
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:26,540
I wanted to tell Richard but he was out of
town on another of Kelly's jobs.

490
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,430
What could I do?

491
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:33,410
I was afraid, and Kelly knew that I was afraid.

492
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:41,140
He did not speak about it again but on Friday
he called me into his office and gave me my

493
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,250
plane ticket and some money.

494
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,720
There was no escape.

495
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,980
Saturday morning came, and I went to the airport.

496
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:56,069
While I was waiting there, I heard my name.

497
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:59,619
I knew that voice immediately.

498
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:01,410
I turned round.

499
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,440
'Richard!'

500
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
I cried.

501
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,039
'Oh Richard, I'm so pleased to see you.

502
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,369
But what are you doing here?'

503
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:14,900
'I'm coming with you.

504
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,090
To Frankfurt.

505
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,140
Kelly told me to.

506
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,730
Look, here's my ticket.'

507
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,500
'You mean...

508
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Wait a minute.

509
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,890
What did Kelly tell you?'

510
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,020
Richard was smiling.

511
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,099
'He told me to come with you, that's all.

512
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:39,750
To stay with you... you know, on the plane...
and in Frankfurt.'

513
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,900
I began to understand.

514
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,870
'He told you to watch me, you mean.'

515
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:53,270
When we were on the plane, Richard asked me
about my work at Kelly's.

516
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:59,039
He knew very little about Kelly's business
and he knew very little about our trip to

517
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,410
Frankfurt.

518
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:06,070
I told him about the 'egg' boxes and why I
was afraid.

519
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:13,020
'The boxes are small, Kelly said, so I think
it's jewellery,' I told Richard.

520
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,260
'And I think...

521
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,329
I think it's stolen jewellery.'

522
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:25,940
Then Richard got very angry, and said, 'Kelly
can't send you on a job like this.

523
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,230
Why doesn't he go himself?'

524
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,119
'But that's it, Richard.

525
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,260
It's easier for a girl - Kelly knows that.

526
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,190
He's clever, you know.

527
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,720
But he thinks I'm afraid.

528
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,270
So he's sent you to watch me.'

529
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:47,230
For a time Richard just sat there, and thought.

530
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,819
After a while he turned to me.

531
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:56,980
'You're not going to do it - you're not going
to carry stolen jewellery for that man.

532
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,730
Leave it to me.

533
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:02,180
I'll think of something, of some plan.'

534
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,780
Then he was silent again.

535
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:12,020
When we arrived in Frankfurt, we went to a
hotel for breakfast.

536
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:18,359
Then Richard went off to buy a newspaper,
and after that we sat around for about half

537
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:19,569
an hour.

538
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:25,930
We had to meet Kelly's friends outside the
hotel.

539
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,910
When we walked out of the door, two men were
waiting for us in a white Mercedes.

540
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:39,099
We drove through the busy streets of the city
and then into the country.

541
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:44,170
Sometime later we stopped at an old house
with trees all around it.

542
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:50,970
We all went inside and the men took us into
a dark room at the back and left us there.

543
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:56,990
It was cold and Richard gave me his coat.

544
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:01,039
He was smiling quietly to himself.

545
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,230
We waited there in silence.

546
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,760
In another room people were talking.

547
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,549
We could hear their voices.

548
00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:14,900
Then the driver of the Mercedes came and took
us upstairs.

549
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:20,859
A short man in a dark green shirt was sitting
at a desk.

550
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:25,869
In front of him on the desk were three boxes.

551
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:29,990
He was playing with a pen and watching us
carefully.

552
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,410
Richard spoke to him in German.

553
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:39,850
I did not understand, but I heard Kelly's
name and the man in the green shirt began

554
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:40,940
to say something.

555
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:49,630
All at once there were noises outside, the
sound of cars and voices and people running.

556
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:58,330
The man jumped up from his desk and pulled
a gun out of his pocket.

557
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:06,390
He tried to get to the window but at that
minute the door opened and three or four policemen

558
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,530
ran in and jumped on him.

559
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:15,980
There was a fight, but the police got his
gun from him and held him on the floor.

560
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:24,570
An older man arrived, a police inspector with
grey hair, and began to give orders to the

561
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,430
policemen.

562
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:33,220
He called across the room to Richard and me
in very good English, 'Are you all right?

563
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,140
They didn't hurt you, did they?'

564
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:43,720
He gave some more orders and then he came
across to Richard and held out his hand.

565
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,920
'Well done, young man.

566
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,510
I must thank you for your help.'

567
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,329
He turned to me.

568
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:52,460
'And thank you too.

569
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,180
You've done very well, both of you.

570
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,789
It's been a good day's work for all of us.'

571
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:03,410
I looked at Richard and he gave me a little
smile.

572
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,160
'What does he mean?'

573
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,260
I asked, but Richard did not answer.

574
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,940
The inspector then explained to me.

575
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,089
'Your friend phoned us this morning from your
hotel.

576
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:20,820
After that it was easy.

577
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:27,700
We just waited near the hotel for the white
Mercedes and then followed it here.'

578
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:34,970
The inspector took us back into Frankfurt
in his car and when we arrived there, we went

579
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,019
at once to his office.

580
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:44,869
He ordered coffee for us and while we were
waiting for it, he said, 'You've helped us

581
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:49,980
a lot already but we need your help with one
more thing.

582
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,960
There's still Mr Kelly... and his friends.

583
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,530
We have a plan for them.'

584
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:02,839
Oh yes, he knew all about Joe Kelly.

585
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:08,710
He brought out the three boxes and put them
on the table in front of us.

586
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:14,630
Then he said, 'We would like you to take these
back to England with you.'

587
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,329
Richard and I looked at him in surprise.

588
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:26,660
The inspector waited for a minute and then
went on, 'You don't need to be afraid.

589
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:32,200
Perhaps you're thinking about the British
police, is that it?

590
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,430
Everything will be all right.

591
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:40,670
I will speak to Chief Superintendent Edwards
in London, and there'll be no trouble for

592
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,920
you.

593
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,109
Now listen carefully.'

594
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:47,260
He went on.

595
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,089
'Just give the jewellery to Kelly.

596
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:57,480
He won't know about the "accident to his German
friends, and you must not tell anybody about

597
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,450
it, or about our conversation today.

598
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:04,240
That's very important.

599
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,560
The British police will watch Kelly and wait.

600
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,050
Do you understand?'

601
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:19,760
This plan sounded dangerous to me but Richard
said, 'Yes, of course well do it, won't we,

602
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,760
Wendy?'

603
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,269
Richard is not afraid of Kelly, you see.

604
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:29,180
So we brought the boxes back with us on the
Saturday evening plane from Frankfurt.

605
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:38,400
We did not get back until nearly midnight
but we took the boxes at once to Kelly's house.

606
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,349
He told us to wait and then went into another
room.

607
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:48,710
When he came back, he was very happy.

608
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:53,079
He put his hand in his pocket and took out
some gold ear-rings.

609
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:59,650
'These are for you, Wendy - for your birthday
next Thursday.'

610
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:04,520
'No, Mr Kelly, no, you mustn't.

611
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,230
I can't take them, really I can't.'

612
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:12,510
'Of course you can,' Kelly laughed.

613
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,819
'You've worked hard for them.

614
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:18,839
And we must have a party for you.

615
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:23,130
Let's get some people together on Thursday
night.

616
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,650
Where would you like to go?

617
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:27,210
To the Ritz?

618
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:30,160
Or perhaps a disco?

619
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,020
No, I know...', and he began to sing:

620
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,559
Let's all meet at Maxim's,

621
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:40,490
We'll have a wonderful time.

622
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:48,630
I told him three times that I didn't want
a party but he didn't want to listen.

623
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,950
He was too pleased with himself.

624
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:55,720
'Oh, yes, Wendy.

625
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,220
We must have a party.

626
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:01,599
And you must wear the earrings.

627
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,299
Then I'll know you're my good little girl.'

628
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:11,490
His mouth was smiling but his eyes were cold.

629
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:16,240
Richard said quietly in my ear, 'Just agree
with him, Wendy.

630
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:21,200
And take his ear-rings - you can give them
back later.

631
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,220
We don't want anything to go wrong now.'

632
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:29,279
The next few days passed very slowly.

633
00:46:29,279 --> 00:46:33,819
On Monday and Tuesday everything was quiet
in the office.

634
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:38,369
Kelly did not speak to me again about the
visit to Frankfurt.

635
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:44,599
He stayed in his office most of the time and
was always on the telephone.

636
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:49,890
No police came to the office, and nothing
happened.

637
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,980
I began to feel afraid.

638
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,400
Early on Wednesday morning Richard called
in to see me.

639
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,290
'Is he in yet?' he asked.

640
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:04,170
He looked at Kelly's door.

641
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,059
'Not yet.

642
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:07,059
Why?'

643
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:09,930
'I want the keys to his office.

644
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,100
Just for a minute.'

645
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,359
'But Richard...'

646
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:16,119
'Come on, Wendy, he'll never know.'

647
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:19,329
'You can't go in there, Richard.

648
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:24,130
He'll be here in a minute - it's too dangerous.'

649
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,140
'Please, Wendy.

650
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,420
It won't take long.

651
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,150
I'll be out again immediately.'

652
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,640
'But why...

653
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,920
what do you want?'

654
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,059
'Don't ask questions.

655
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:40,450
Just give me the keys - quickly.'

656
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:45,670
Of course in the end I gave him the keys.

657
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,640
He opened Kelly's door and went inside.

658
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,920
Some minutes passed and then he gave a shout.

659
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,230
I think I've got something!'

660
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:03,829
I went in and saw that Richard was standing
in front of Kelly's desk with a letter in

661
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:05,890
his hand.

662
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,770
He held it up for me.

663
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:12,680
'This', he said, 'is going to help us.'

664
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,130
'What do you mean?'

665
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,160
I did not understand.

666
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,339
'Listen.'

667
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:23,250
He read from the letter...

668
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:27,220
the eggs arrived last weekend and they are
now in my house.

669
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:32,660
Be there on 18th April, 11 a.m.

670
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,529
'The 18th,' I said.

671
00:48:36,529 --> 00:48:40,330
'That's next Saturday.'

672
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:43,359
Just then I heard a car outside.

673
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,619
'That's him,' I cried.

674
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:49,920
'Quick, put that letter back.

675
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,160
You must get out of here at once.'

676
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:58,240
I ran through to my office with Richard behind
me.

677
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,339
'Out there - quick.'

678
00:49:00,339 --> 00:49:08,289
I pushed him into the kitchen and at the same
time the door opened and Kelly walked in.

679
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:12,839
'Good morning, Wendy.'

680
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:19,450
He did not stop but went into his office and
closed the door behind him.

681
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:27,330
Richard then quickly left the office and I
did not see him again that day.

682
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:31,490
He phoned me the next afternoon, which was
Thursday.

683
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:35,549
I knew at once that he was unhappy about something.

684
00:49:35,549 --> 00:49:36,940
'What's happened, Richard?'

685
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:41,339
I asked.

686
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:46,380
'I'm not working for Kelly anymore,' he told
me.

687
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:52,619
This morning Kelly told me to do another of
his little jobs for him, and I said no.

688
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:57,119
So he started shouting at me, and then he
told me to go.

689
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,080
So that's it - I'm looking for another job.'

690
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,339
He gave a little laugh.

691
00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:12,410
'And worse than that, he hasn't paid me, and
now I can't buy you a birthday present.'

692
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:17,140
'Oh Richard, that's not important,' I said.

693
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:21,220
'But are you coming to Kelly's party for me
at Maxim's tonight?

694
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,390
I won't go without you.

695
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,069
You must come.'

696
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:28,799
'I can't, Wendy.

697
00:50:28,799 --> 00:50:32,790
I'd like to be there, you know that.

698
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:36,020
But we mustn't meet until after Saturday.'

699
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,599
'Why not?

700
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,760
What's happening on Saturday?

701
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,640
And what's happening about the... the egg
boxes?

702
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:50,059
What are the police doing?

703
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:56,599
Kelly says I must wear my new gold ear-rings
at the party, but I don't want to.

704
00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:03,240
They came from Frankfurt in one of those egg
boxes, and they're stolen!

705
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,339
Oh Richard, I'm afraid!

706
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:10,650
What am I going to do?'

707
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:15,240
'Everything's going to be all right, Wendy.

708
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,240
Really.

709
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,619
I've got a plan.

710
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:21,609
Just go to the party, and don't worry.

711
00:51:21,609 --> 00:51:24,890
I'll see you soon.'

712
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:35,559
Richard put the phone down, and I have not
seen or heard from him since then.

713
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:36,559
CHAPTER FOUR

714
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:42,190
Another birthday present

715
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:45,940
Jennifer felt very sorry for Wendy.

716
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:52,309
The girl's hands were shaking, and she was
trying not to cry.

717
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:57,700
Jennifer went and sat next to her, and put
her arm round her.

718
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:06,089
'So what happened after the party on Thursday
night, when the police took you away?'

719
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:08,290
she asked quietly.

720
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:12,110
'Oh, it was terrible!'

721
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,140
Wendy said.

722
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:20,410
'They took the earrings from me, of course,
and they asked a lot of questions.

723
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:28,190
I told them that the ear-rings were a present
from Kelly, and I told them all about the

724
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:32,750
police in Germany, but they didn't believe
me.

725
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:40,490
They told me to go to the office on Friday,
and not to say anything to anybody.

726
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,799
And they wanted to talk to Richard.

727
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:46,420
Wendy turned to Jennifer.

728
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,849
'What am I going to do?

729
00:52:49,849 --> 00:52:51,089
she asked.

730
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:55,519
'Why didn't the police believe me?

731
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:58,330
Haven't the German police talked to them?

732
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,900
And where's Richard?

733
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:05,000
I can't find him.'

734
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,740
She began to cry quietly.

735
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,809
Jennifer stood up.

736
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:15,910
'We must phone the police in Germany,' she
said.

737
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:21,920
'I'll talk to that policeman, Barrett, who
came to see me last night, and...'

738
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,539
Just then there was a knock on the door.

739
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:31,150
Jennifer went to the door and called out,
'Who is it?

740
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,140
'It's me!

741
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,140
Richard!'

742
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,890
came Richard's excited voice.

743
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:40,539
Jennifer opened the door quickly.

744
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:49,829
Beside Richard there were two policemen - Barrett
and another, taller man.

745
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:54,549
'Everything's OK,' Richard said happily.

746
00:53:54,549 --> 00:53:57,579
He turned to the two policemen and smiled.

747
00:53:57,579 --> 00:54:02,260
'And you're not going to lock me up, are you?'

748
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:06,329
'I'm very pleased to hear that!' said Jennifer.

749
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:08,410
'But what's going on?

750
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:12,650
Can somebody please explain?'

751
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:16,670
They all went into the sitting-room, and Wendy
jumped up.

752
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:23,420
She looked at the policemen and her face went
white.

753
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:29,890
Everybody began talking at once, and Richard
put his arms round Wendy.

754
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:34,049
The tall policeman laughed and turned to Jennifer.

755
00:54:34,049 --> 00:54:38,940
'My name is Edwards,' he said.

756
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:45,230
'I'm sorry about Barrett's visit to you last
night, but we didn't know about Richard and

757
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:47,490
Wendy then.

758
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:51,079
I talked to the Frankfurt police an hour ago.

759
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:57,970
We already knew about the stolen jewellery
in Germany, of course, and we were watching

760
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,680
Kelly.

761
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:05,790
But they didn't tell us that they caught the
German thieves last weekend, or about their

762
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:08,970
little plan with Richard and Wendy.

763
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:12,990
They wanted to keep it very secret.

764
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:17,220
They were afraid that Kelly would hear about
it.

765
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:21,180
But we know now, and everything's all right.'

766
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:25,050
'But what about Kelly?'

767
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,140
cried Wendy.

768
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,910
'And the egg boxes...?'

769
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,000
Barrett smiled.

770
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,849
'You'll have to find a new boss.

771
00:55:33,849 --> 00:55:38,749
Kelly is going to be in prison for a long
time.

772
00:55:38,749 --> 00:55:41,569
We got him this morning.

773
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:44,170
But it's Richard's story.

774
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:47,540
He's been very helpful to us.

775
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,549
He can tell you all about it.'

776
00:55:50,549 --> 00:55:56,640
The two policemen left, and Jennifer turned
to her young brother.

777
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:05,210
He was sitting with his arm round Wendy, and
her face was now bright and happy.

778
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:06,440
'Well!'

779
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,960
Jennifer said.

780
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,490
'Start talking, Richard!'

781
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:16,259
'I've told Jennifer all about last week,'
Wendy explained.

782
00:56:16,259 --> 00:56:20,549
'And she was in Maxim's on Thursday night.

783
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:22,980
But what happened this morning?'

784
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,400
Richard laughed.

785
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:34,119
'When I looked in Kelly's office last Wednesday,
I found that letter about the "eggs".

786
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:36,310
You remember, Wendy?

787
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:45,160
Well, the German policeman told us to do nothing,
but I wanted the British police to catch Kelly.

788
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:52,079
Perhaps they were watching Kelly carefully,
but I wanted to be sure.

789
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:59,650
So early this morning I went to the police
station and told them about the letter.

790
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:04,450
They were not very friendly and they kept
me in the police station.

791
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:08,380
But they went to Kelly's house at eleven o'clock.

792
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:15,789
They found Kelly there and two other men,
who were buying the stolen jewellery from

793
00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:17,420
Kelly.

794
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:23,609
So they brought Kelly and the two other men
into the police station... and the egg boxes,

795
00:57:23,609 --> 00:57:25,720
of course.

796
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:32,970
Kelly was very angry, and told the police
that Wendy and I were the thieves!

797
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:40,920
I told Barrett and Edwards about the German
policeman's plan again and again, and in the

798
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:46,160
end they telephoned Germany and talked to
the inspector in Frankfurt.

799
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,700
He explained everything.

800
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,549
So here we are!'

801
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:54,400
Richard laughed again, happily.

802
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,550
He put his hands in his pockets.

803
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:04,730
'And here's twenty pounds for my big sister,
and a little birthday present for my favourite

804
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,820
girl.'

805
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,740
Jennifer looked at him.

806
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:13,440
She suddenly felt very happy about her brother.

807
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,260
'You can keep the money,' she said.

808
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,910
'It's not important.

809
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:23,579
But I only gave it to you on Thursday night,'
she said.

810
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:24,630
'How...?'

811
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:29,210
'I've got a new job,' said Richard.

812
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,329
'Started yesterday.

813
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:36,710
And this time I'm not working for a jewellery
thief!'

814
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:42,009
Wendy opened her present, and laughed for
the first time that day.

815
00:58:42,009 --> 00:58:44,390
'Oh look!'

816
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:45,390
she said.

817
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:47,900
'It's some gold earrings!

818
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,380
They're lovely.'

819
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,690
Richard laughed too.

820
00:58:52,690 --> 00:59:00,130
'They're only small ear-rings, Wendy, but
I can tell you this - they did not come from

821
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,579
Frankfurt in an egg box!'

822
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:02,979
- THE END -
