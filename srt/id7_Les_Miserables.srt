CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,800
Jean Valjean

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,020
One evening in October 1815,  

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:18,960
an hour before sunset, a man with a long beard and 
dusty, torn clothes walked into the town of Digne.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,540
He was in his late forties, of medium 
height, broad-shouldered and strong.

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,660
A leather cap half-hid his face, which 
was sunburnt and shining with sweat.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,360
His rough yellow shirt was 
unbuttoned, revealing a hairy chest.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,620
On his back was a heavy soldier's bag, 
and in his hand was a large wooden stick.

9
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,820
The townspeople, who had never seen him before,  

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,960
watched with interest as he 
stopped for water at a fountain.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,080
Children followed him to the marketplace, where 
he stopped for more water at another fountain.

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,780
He then crossed the square towards an 
inn, and entered by the kitchen door.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,140
The innkeeper, who was also the cook, 
was busy with his pots and pans,  

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,600
preparing a meal for a group of travellers 
who were laughing and joking in the next room.

15
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,940
'What can I do for you, Monsieur?' 
he asked without looking up.

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,380
'A meal and a bed,' said the stranger.

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,940
'Of course.'

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,240
The innkeeper turned to look at him.

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,140
Then, seeing the visitors rough appearance, 
he added, 'If you can pay for it.'

20
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,300
'I have money.'

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,160
The stranger produced an old 
leather purse from his jacket.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,100
'Then you're welcome,' the innkeeper said.

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,080
The stranger smiled with relief 
and sat down by the fire.

24
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,920
He did not see a young boy run out with a 
note that the innkeeper had quickly written.

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,580
He did not see the boy return a short time 
later and whisper something to the innkeeper.

26
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,500
'When will the meal be ready?' the stranger asked.

27
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,940
'I'm sorry, Monsieur,' the innkeeper said.

28
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,920
'You can't stay here.

29
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,320
I've got no free rooms.'

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,320
'Then put me in a stable.

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,800
All I need is a quiet corner somewhere.

32
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,300
After dinner

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,280
'You can't eat here either,' 
the innkeeper interrupted.

34
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,320
'I haven't enough food.'

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,280
'What about all that food in the pots?'

36
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,960
The innkeeper approached and, bending towards 
the man, said in a fierce whisper, 'Get out.

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,060
I know who you are.

38
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,080
Your name is Jean Valjean.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,240
You've just been released from prison.

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,720
I can't serve people like you here.'

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,500
The man rose without another word, 
picked up his bag and stick, and left.

42
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,220
Outside, it was growing dark and a cold wind 
was blowing from the mountains in the east.

43
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,260
The man looked around, desperate 
for somewhere to spend the night.

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,340
He tried another inn, but the same thing happened.

45
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,580
He knocked on the doors of people's houses,  

46
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,180
but news of his arrival had quickly spread and 
nobody would offer him shelter from the cold.

47
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,880
He even tried sleeping in a garden, 
but was chased away by a dog.

48
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,980
Finally, he found himself in the cathedral square.

49
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,020
He shook his fist at the church and then,  

50
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,340
cold and hungry, he lay down on 
a stone bench by the doorway.

51
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,720
A few minutes later, an old woman came out 
of the cathedral and saw him lying there.

52
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,800
'What are you doing?' she asked.

53
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,260
He answered angrily, 'Can't 
you see? I'm trying to sleep.'

54
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,820
'On this bench, in this cold wind?'

55
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,960
'I've slept for nineteen years on a piece of wood.

56
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,040
Now it's stone.

57
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,760
What's the difference?'

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,600
'Why don't you go to an inn?'

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,660
'Because I haven't any money,' he lied.

60
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,060
The old woman opened her purse 
and gave him a few coins.

61
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,920
Then she said, 'Have you tried everywhere?'

62
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,740
'I've knocked at every door.'

63
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,820
'What about that one over there?'  

64
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,100
she said, pointing across the square to 
a small house beside the bishop's palace.

65
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,860
***

66
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,660
The Bishop of Digne was a kind 
old man who, many years earlier,  

67
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,360
had given his palace to the town hospital.

68
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,020
He lived a simple life with his 
sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine,  

69
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:10,380
and his old servant, Madame Magloire, and 
he was much loved by the people in the town.

70
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,480
He trusted everyone.

71
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,780
His doors were never locked, so that anybody 
who needed his help could find him easily.

72
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,120
That evening, Mme Magloire was chatting with 
Mile Baptistine before serving the meal.

73
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,040
'People say there's a stranger in town,' she said.

74
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,920
'The police say that he looks dangerous,  

75
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,120
and it would be better for everyone 
to lock their windows and doors.'

76
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,720
'Brother.'

77
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,420
Mile Baptistine turned to the 
bishop, who was sitting by the fire.

78
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,500
'Did you hear what Mme Magloire was saying?'

79
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:57,060
'Something about a dangerous stranger walking 
the streets?' he asked with an amused smile.

80
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,320
'This is no joke,' Mme Magloire said.

81
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,460
'The man is in rags and has 
an evil look on his face.

82
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,440
Everybody in the town agrees that 
something terrible will happen tonight.

83
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,060
And your sister agrees with 
me that this house isn't safe.

84
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,980
If you like, I can make arrangements 
now to get a lock put on the door

85
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,620
Before the bishop could reply, 
there was a heavy knock on the door.

86
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
'Come in,' said the bishop.

87
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,500
The door opened and Jean 
Valjean, the stranger, walked in.

88
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,760
Mme Magloire trembled, open-mouthed  

89
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,620
with fear, while Mile Baptistine 
rose from her seat with alarm.

90
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,080
The bishop, however, looked 
calmly at his unexpected visitor.

91
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,980
'My name is Jean Valjean,' the stranger 
said before anybody could speak.

92
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,880
'I've been in prison for nineteen years.

93
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,580
They let me out four days ago.

94
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:10,260
I've been walking all day, and nobody in this 
town will give me food or a bed for the night.

95
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,700
A woman saw me lying on a stone bench across 
the square and suggested that I come here.

96
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,400
So here I am.

97
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,400
What is this place? Is it an inn? I've got money.

98
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,680
Will you let me stay?'

99
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,000
'Mme Magloire,' said the bishop,  

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,080
'will you please prepare another place 
at the table for this gentleman?'

101
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,440
Valjean took a step forward.

102
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,620
'No, you don't understand,' he said.

103
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,480
'I've spent five years in 
prison for violent robbery,  

104
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,720
another fourteen years for 
trying to escape four times.

105
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,360
I'm a dangerous man.'

106
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:02,940
'Mme Magloire,' the bishop went on, 'you must 
put clean sheets on the bed in the spare room.'

107
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,940
Mme Magloire, an obedient servant, 
left the room without protest.

108
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,820
The bishop turned to the man.

109
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,780
'Sit down and warm yourself, Monsieur.

110
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,880
Supper will soon be ready.'

111
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,840
Jean Valjean's face, which had been 
hard and fierce, suddenly softened.

112
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,460
'You really mean it?' he asked, his 
voice trembling with childish excitement.

113
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,860
'You'll let me stay?

114
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,720
I'm a dangerous criminal, 
but you called me "Monsieur".

115
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,120
I don't believe it.

116
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,800
May I ask your name, sir? Are you an innkeeper?'

117
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,520
'I'm a priest,' said the bishop.

118
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,560
'And this is where I live.'

119
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,020
'A priest?' Valjean said, sitting by the fire.

120
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,380
'So I don't have to pay?'

121
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,580
'You can keep your money,' the bishop replied.

122
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,480
During dinner, Mile Baptistine 
looked at Valjean kindly while  

123
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,480
the bishop talked about the 
local cheese-making industry.

124
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,540
Valjean was so hungry that, at first, 
he paid no attention to anyone.

125
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,340
Soon, however, he began to relax, 
and looked around the room.

126
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,380
'This is not the house of a rich man,' he thought.

127
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,340
'And the travellers in the 
inn eat better than this.'

128
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,260
But then he looked at the table, and saw the 
beautiful silver candlesticks, knives and forks.

129
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,180
After dinner, the bishop said goodnight to his 
sister, picked up one of the two candlesticks and,  

130
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,940
handing the other to his guest, said, 
'I'll show you to your room, Monsieur.'

131
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,480
Valjean followed the bishop 
upstairs into a bedroom.

132
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,420
This was the bishop's bedroom.

133
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,860
As he was following the bishop 
across the room, however,  

134
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,860
he noticed Mme Magloire putting the silver 
knives and forks in a cupboard by the bed.

135
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,940
The bishop showed his guest into the spare room.

136
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,240
'Sleep well,' he said.

137
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,120
'Before you leave tomorrow, you must 
have a bowl of warm milk from our cows.'

138
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,620
Valjean was so tired that he fell asleep, 
fully-dressed, on top of the sheets,  

139
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,920
but he didn't sleep for long.

140
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:46,020
When he woke up, the cathedral clock was striking 
two, but he had not woken because of this.

141
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,940
He had woken because the bed was too comfortable; 
he had not slept in a proper bed for twenty years.

142
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:02,040
Unable to return to sleep, he gazed into the 
darkness, thinking about the past twenty years.

143
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,320
Life had been unjust to him, and he was angry.

144
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,600
In 1795, he had lost his job as a tree-cutter.

145
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,320
At that time he was looking after his sister, 
whose husband had died, and her seven children.

146
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:27,300
Out of work, and with no food in the house, he had 
been arrested for trying to steal a loaf of bread.

147
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,280
Now, at last, he was free, but he felt 
bitter and angry about his lost years.

148
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,740
The world had been unfair to 
him, and he wanted revenge.

149
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,280
Then, remembering the silver on 
the bishop's table, he had an idea.

150
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,040
He sat up, swung his feet to 
the floor and slowly stood up.

151
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,620
The house was silent.

152
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,520
He moved carefully towards 
the window and looked out.

153
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,140
The night was not very 
dark; there was a full moon,  

154
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,300
hidden from time to time by large 
clouds moving quickly across the sky.

155
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,720
After studying the garden, he 
decided that escape would be easy.

156
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:25,560
He turned back to the room, picked up his bag and 
took out a short iron bar, sharpened at one end.

157
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,760
He then put his shoes into the bag and, 
grasping the iron bar in his right hand,  

158
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,780
he moved quietly towards the 
door of the bishop's bedroom.

159
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,240
It was half-open.

160
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,080
The bishop had not closed it.

161
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,420
Valjean stood listening.

162
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,340
There was no sound.

163
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,440
He gave the door a gentle push 
and crept into the bedroom.

164
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,580
Just as he reached the side of the bishop's bed,  

165
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,620
the moon came out from behind a 
cloud and filled the room with light.

166
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,840
Valjean gazed down at the bishop's gentle, 
sleeping face, and felt a kind of terror.

167
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:17,460
He had never before seen such 
peace, such kindness, such trust.

168
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,920
He suddenly turned away and 
moved quickly to the cupboard.

169
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,320
The first thing he saw when he opened 
the door was the basket of silver.

170
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,200
He grabbed it, hurried back to the spare 
bedroom, picked up his stick and bag,  

171
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:41,760
climbed out of the window, emptied the silver 
into his bag and threw the basket into the garden.

172
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,840
A minute later he climbed the garden 
wall and disappeared into the trees.

173
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:56,280
Early the next morning, while the bishop 
was studying the flowers in his garden,  

174
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,260
Mme Magloire ran out of the house 
with a look of alarm on her face.

175
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,300
'Monseigneur, do you know 
where the silver-basket is?'

176
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,420
'Yes,' said the bishop.

177
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,480
'I found it in one of the flowerbeds.'

178
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,420
'But it's empty!' she cried.

179
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,380
'Where's the silver?'

180
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,680
'Oh, you're worried about the 
silver? I don't know where that is.'

181
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,420
'Heaven save us, it's been stolen!' she cried.

182
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,360
'The man who came last night! 
He's run off with our silver!'

183
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,720
The bishop, who had been bending sadly 
over a plant damaged by the basket,  

184
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:43,500
looked up and said gently, 'I think I 
was wrong to keep the silver for so long.

185
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,560
It really belongs to the poor.

186
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,040
I should have given it away a long time ago.'

187
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,100
Later that morning, as the bishop 
and his sister were having breakfast,  

188
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,140
there was a knock on the door.

189
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,320
Four men walked into the room.

190
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,960
Three of them were policemen; 
the fourth was Jean Valjean.

191
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,300
'Monseigneur...

192
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,800
' the sergeant in charge of the group began.

193
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,080
Valjean raised his head with surprise.

194
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,860
'Monseigneur?' he repeated.

195
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,140
'I thought he was a priest.'

196
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,780
'Silence,' said one of the policemen, 
'This is the Bishop of Digne.'

197
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,860
The bishop, meanwhile, had moved towards the 
group of men and was smiling at Jean Valjean.

198
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,540
'I'm delighted to see you 
again, dear friend,' he said.

199
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:45,540
'But what about the candlesticks? I gave 
you those as well, don't you remember?  

200
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,940
They're silver like the rest, and 
worth at least two hundred francs.

201
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,580
Did you forget to take them?'

202
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,560
Jean Valjean's eyes widened with disbelief.

203
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,520
'Monseigneur,' said the sergeant, 'do I 
understand that this man was telling the truth?  

204
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,940
We found this silver in his bag, and

205
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,560
'And he told you,' the bishop 
finished the sentence for him,  

206
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,140
'that an old priest had given it to 
him? Yes, he was telling the truth.'

207
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,240
'So this man isn't a thief? 'The 
sergeant looked as surprised as Valjean.

208
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,440
'Not at all.

209
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,740
So you can let him go at once.'

210
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,760
The policemen let go of Valjean's arms.

211
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,860
He moved his feet nervously, 
uncertain of what to say at first.

212
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:47,220
Then he murmured, 'Am I really free to go?'

213
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,280
'Of course,' said the bishop.

214
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,180
'But this time, you mustn't 
forget your candlesticks.'

215
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,500
He fetched them from a shelf 
and gave them to Valjean.

216
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,480
'Now, go in peace,' he said softly.

217
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,000
The policemen left, but Valjean did not move.

218
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,000
He did not know what to think.

219
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,440
The bishop walked up to him 
and said in a low voice,  

220
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:23,340
'Don't forget that you've promised to use 
the money to make yourself an honest man.'

221
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,340
Valjean, who did not remember having 
made such a promise, was silent.

222
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,860
'Jean Valjean,' the bishop continued,  

223
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:41,880
'I've bought your soul from the 
Devil, and have given it to God.'

224
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,060
***

225
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,660
Jean Valjean left the town 
and ran into the countryside,  

226
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,000
blindly following lanes and paths, not 
realizing that he was running in circles.

227
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,820
He was filled with a strange kind 
of anger, but he did not know why.

228
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,680
Finally, as evening fell, he 
sat on the ground, exhausted,  

229
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,840
and gazed across the fields at the distant 
mountains, wishing that he was back in prison.

230
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,080
When he had been angry at the world, 
he had felt calm and sure of himself.

231
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,740
But now, for the first time in twenty 
years, a man had shown him great kindness,  

232
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,840
and he did not know what to feel.

233
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,340
Suddenly, he heard the sound of singing.

234
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,620
A boy of about ten years old was 
coming along a footpath with a  

235
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,780
small box on his back and dirty knees 
showing through holes in his trousers.

236
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,660
As he sang, he threw a coin into the 
air and caught it before it fell.

237
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:53,520
Not noticing Jean Valjean sitting by the side of 
the path, he threw the coin higher into the air.

238
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,420
This time, however, he did not catch it and 
it rolled along the ground towards Valjean,  

239
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,700
who immediately put his foot on it.

240
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,500
The boy, unafraid, walked up to Valjean.

241
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,460
'Please, Monsieur, may I have my coin?'

242
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,360
'What's your name?' asked Valjean.

243
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,160
'Petit-Gervais,' said the boy, smiling trustfully.

244
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,060
'I'm a chimney sweep, and 
that money is all I have.'

245
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,260
'Go away,' said Valjean.

246
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,580
'Please, Monsieur, that's my money.'

247
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,760
Valjean lowered his head and did not reply.

248
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,120
'My money!' the boy cried.

249
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,780
'My piece of silver! My coin!'

250
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,240
Valjean seemed not to hear him.

251
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,260
The boy seized his collar and shook him.

252
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,560
'I want my money!' he cried.

253
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,000
Valjean slowly raised his head and stared 
with a sort of amazement at the child.

254
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,340
Then, reaching for his 
stick, he said, 'Go to Hell!'

255
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,800
The boy, suddenly afraid of the mad, fierce 
look in Valjean's eyes, turned and ran.

256
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,860
Valjean stood for some time gazing emptily around  

257
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,860
him at the sunset and the 
shadows moving in on him.

258
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,700
Suddenly he shivered, as if he had become 
aware for the first time of the icy wind.

259
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,860
He bent down to pick up his bag but, as he did so,  

260
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,720
he caught sight of the silver coin, 
half-buried by his foot in the earth.

261
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,800
It affected him like an electric shock.

262
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,580
'What's that?' he murmured.

263
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,820
He stared at the coin with a look of puzzlement, 
as if he were trying to remember something.

264
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,860
Then, with a sudden movement, 
he bent down and picked it up.

265
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,220
He looked around but could see 
nothing in the darkness - just  

266
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,580
a purple mist rising slowly from the fields.

267
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,200
He called the boy's name, but there was no reply.

268
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Within minutes he was running 
along the path, shouting.

269
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,040
'Petit-Gervais! Petit-Gervais!' 
There was still no reply.

270
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,600
A short time later, he met a priest on horseback.

271
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,440
'Have you seen a boy go by?' he asked.

272
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,360
The priest shook his head.

273
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,380
'No.

274
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,580
Why do you ask?'

275
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,160
Valjean produced two five-franc 
pieces and gave them to the priest.

276
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,800
'This is for your poor, Monsieur.

277
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,760
He was a boy of about ten, a chimney sweep.

278
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,000
Monsieur, you must report me to the police.

279
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,380
I'm a thief.

280
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,960
I stole money from him.

281
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
Here, let me give you more money

282
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:04,560
But before Valjean could produce more 
coins, the priest rode away in terror.

283
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,760
Valjean looked for the boy for another hour,  

284
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,440
running along the path, calling 
out his name, but with no success.

285
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,540
Finally he stopped and sat, exhausted, on a rock.

286
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,600
Then, his heart full of grief for what he 
had done, he buried his face in his hands  

287
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,220
and, for the first time in 
nineteen years, he cried.

288
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,720
CHAPTER TWO

289
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,000
Fantine

290
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,080
On a spring evening in 1818, in the 
village of Montfermeil, not far from Paris,  

291
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,680
two little girls were playing 
on a swing outside a small inn.

292
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,020
Their mother - a big, red-haired 
woman with a plain face - sat on  

293
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,940
the doorstep of the inn, watching them.

294
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,920
'You have two very pretty children, 
Madame,' a voice said from close beside her.

295
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,400
The woman looked round and saw a young woman 
with a child sleeping peacefully in her arms.

296
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,100
The mother was young and pretty, 
but she looked poor and unhappy.

297
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,220
She did not smile, and lines of sadness 
ran down the side of her pale cheeks.

298
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:28,140
Her clothes were old and dirty, and she wore a 
tight, plain cap over her beautiful blonde hair.

299
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,740
'Thank you,' said the woman.

300
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,820
'Why don't you sit down for 
a minute? You look tired.

301
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,780
'When the young woman had sat down next to 
her, the red-haired woman introduced herself.

302
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,420
'My name's Thenardier.

303
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,300
My husband and I manage this inn.'

304
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,360
'My names Fantine,' the young woman said.

305
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,780
'I used to work in Paris, but my 
husband died and I lost my job.'

306
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,480
She could not tell Mme Thenardier the truth,  

307
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,340
which was that she had been made pregnant 
by a young man who had then abandoned her.

308
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,240
'I left Paris this morning to look 
for work in Montreuil,' she continued.

309
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,400
'My little girl walked some of 
the way, but she's very small.

310
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,600
I had to carry her and she's fallen asleep.'

311
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,560
As she spoke these words, she gave her 
daughter a loving kiss, which woke her up.

312
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,120
The child's eyes were as wide 
and blue as her mother's.

313
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,920
With a little laugh,  

314
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,540
she jumped off her mother's lap and ran 
to play with the two girls on the swing.

315
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,760
'What's your little girl's 
name?' Mme Thenardier asked.

316
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,900
'Euphrasie - but I call her Cosette.

317
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,640
She's nearly three.'

318
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,020
The two women watched the 
children playing together.

319
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,760
'Children make friends very easily, 
don't they?' Mme Thenardier smiled.

320
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,200
'Look at them.

321
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,060
They could easily be sisters.'

322
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,220
At these words, Fantine did a very strange thing.

323
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:24,900
She took Mme Thenardiers hand and said, 
'Will you look after my daughter for me?'

324
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,660
Mme Thenardier looked at Fantine 
thoughtfully, but said nothing.

325
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,820
'I can't take her with me,' Fantine continued.

326
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,860
'I have to find work, and that's not 
easy with a child but no husband.

327
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,880
As soon as I find a job, I'll come and fetch her.

328
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,860
Will you do that for me? I 
could pay six francs a month.'

329
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:57,360
Mme Thenardier still said nothing, but a 
man's voice from inside the house called,  

330
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,440
'We'll take seven francs a month, 
and six months in advance.'

331
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,740
Fantine agreed.

332
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,720
'And another fifteen francs 
for extras,' called the man.

333
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,680
'You will have them,' said Fantine, assuming 
that she was talking to Mme Thenardiers husband.

334
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,500
'I have eighty francs.'

335
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,120
'Does the child have enough 
clothes?' the man asked.

336
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,080
'She has some beautiful clothes,' Fantine replied.

337
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,260
'Plenty of everything and 
silk dresses like a lady.

338
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,880
They're all in my bag.'

339
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,260
The man's face finally appeared in the doorway.

340
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,060
'Then we agree to look 
after her for you,' he said.

341
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:49,200
The next morning, Fantine kissed her 
daughter goodbye and left for Montreuil,  

342
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,900
crying as if her heart would break.

343
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,940
'This money will be 
useful,'Thenardier said to his wife.

344
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,620
'Now I can pay off all my 
debts and stay out of prison.

345
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,480
I'm proud of you.

346
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,300
You set a very clever trap.'

347
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,980
'Without even intending to,' his wife replied.

348
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,440
One month later, Thenardier 
was short of money again,  

349
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,940
so he took Cosette's beautiful silk clothes 
to Paris and sold them for sixty francs.

350
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,100
The couple dressed Cosette in rags 
and gave her very little food,  

351
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,700
which they made her eat from 
a wooden bowl under the table.

352
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,100
The dog and the cat, who ate with 
her, were her only companions.

353
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,540
Fantine, meanwhile, found work in Montreuil 
and asked for news of her daughter every month.

354
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,820
The Thenardiers always replied that 
she was in good health and very happy.

355
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:59,400
At the end of the year, however, Thenardier was 
not happy with just seven francs a month; he  

356
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:06,180
demanded twelve and Fantine paid without protest, 
happy that her daughter was being well cared for.

357
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:14,400
The Thenardiers, who were loving and gentle 
to their own daughters, Eponine and Azelma,  

358
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,280
treated Cosette like a slave.

359
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,820
They made her get up before dawn every day 
and do all the dirty jobs around the house,  

360
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:29,760
while Eponine and Azelma wore pretty 
clothes and played with dolls.

361
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,780
By the age of five, Cosette had become 
a thin, pale-faced, silent child.

362
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,960
Misery had made her ugly and only 
her beautiful blue eyes remained.

363
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,320
The Thenardiers did not feel guilty 
about treating Cosette badly because  

364
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,100
Fantine had stopped sending them regular payments.

365
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,200
'The child is lucky to have a 
home at all,' they told everybody.

366
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,920
'Without us, she'd be living on the streets.'

367
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,620
***

368
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:10,380
When Fantine first arrived in Montreuil, 
she had immediately found work in a factory.

369
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,860
She rented a small room, sent money 
regularly to the Thenardiers and,  

370
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,660
for a short time, was almost happy.

371
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,320
She forgot many of her problems, and dreamt 
only of Cosette and her plans for the future.

372
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,800
But her happiness did not last long.

373
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,240
Although she was careful to say 
nothing about her daughter to anyone,  

374
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,720
other women at the factory 
soon discovered her secret.

375
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:45,420
An unmarried woman with a child was a terrible 
thing in those days, and Fantine lost her job.

376
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,820
She tried to find work as a servant, 
but no one would employ her.

377
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,680
She finally managed to earn 
a little money sewing shirts,  

378
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,580
but she was unable to send money 
regularly to the Thenardiers.

379
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,580
That winter, Fantine saved money by not having 
a fire, and developed a small, dry cough.

380
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,720
By the following winter, her debts had increased.

381
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,720
The Thenardiers wrote her a frightening letter in 
which they told her that Cosette had no clothes,  

382
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,100
and that they needed ten francs 
immediately to buy her a new dress.

383
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,300
Fantine, who did not have ten francs,  

384
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,400
but who was afraid that her daughter would 
freeze to death, went to the barber's shop.

385
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,100
She took out her comb and let her 
blonde hair fall down to her waist.

386
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,200
'Such beautiful hair!' the barber said.

387
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,300
'How much will you give me for it?' Fantine asked.

388
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,980
'Ten francs.'

389
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,320
'Then cut it off.'

390
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,800
After selling her hair to the barber, 
Fantine was able to buy a woollen dress,  

391
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,960
which she sent to the Thenardiers.

392
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:07,380
The Thenardiers, however, were very angry 
- they had wanted money, not clothes.

393
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:13,500
They gave the dress to their daughter, 
Eponine, and Cosette went on shivering.

394
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,080
A few weeks later, Fantine received 
another letter from the Thenardiers.

395
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,980
This time they wanted forty francs because 
Cosette was very ill and urgently needed medicine.

396
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:32,400
Fantine felt desperate; she did not know 
how to obtain such a large sum of money.

397
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,100
As she was wandering around the town, 
desperately trying to decide what to do,  

398
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,400
she noticed a crowd of 
people in the market square.

399
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,700
She approached them without thinking,  

400
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,780
and discovered that they had 
gathered around a travelling dentist.

401
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,440
Forgetting her troubles for a moment,  

402
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,020
she smiled at the dentist's humorous efforts 
to sell the people of Montreuil false teeth.

403
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,620
Suddenly the dentist saw her.

404
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,700
'You've got lovely teeth,' he said.

405
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,340
'If you sold me your two front 
teeth, I'd pay you forty francs.'

406
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,860
Fantine ran home, upset and disgusted.

407
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,760
'My hair will grow again,' she thought, 
'but teeth would be gone forever.'

408
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,600
But then she thought about her daughter, and 
her own appearance suddenly seemed unimportant.

409
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,940
That evening, she visited the dentist 
at the inn where he was staying,  

410
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,700
and allowed him to remove her teeth.

411
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,540
Fantine could not sleep that night.

412
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:49,140
She sat on her bed, cold and shivering, and 
looked at the two coins shining on the table.

413
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,980
Then she gave a blood-stained smile.

414
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,120
'I'm happy,' she told herself.

415
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,060
'My baby isn't going to die.'

416
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,660
Fantine earned less and 
less money from her sewing,  

417
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,860
and the Thenardiers demanded more 
and more money to look after Cosette.

418
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,460
Fantine spent whole nights crying.

419
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:21,420
What could she do? She had sold her hair 
and her teeth; what else could she sell?  

420
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,920
And then she decided that she had no other 
choice: she would have to sell herself.

421
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,680
She became a prostitute.

422
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,740
CHAPTER THREE

423
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,800
Monsieur Madeleine

424
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:46,200
One winter's evening, a toothless woman 
with a grey face and flowers in her hair  

425
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,560
was arrested for attacking a man in the street.

426
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,320
She was taken to the police 
station, where Inspector Javert,  

427
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,160
the chief of police, sent 
her to prison for six months.

428
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,500
'Please, M.

429
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,100
Javert.'

430
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,560
The woman fell to her knees.

431
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,260
'I owe a hundred francs.

432
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:12,540
If I don't pay, my little girl will lose her 
home and be thrown out on to the streets.

433
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,580
Please don't send me to prison.'

434
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,880
Javert listened to her coldly, then 
ordered a policeman to take her away.

435
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,560
While the policeman was trying 
to drag her to her feet, however,  

436
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,700
a voice from the shadows 
said, 'One moment please.'

437
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:38,160
Javert looked up and saw Monsieur Madeleine, 
one of the most important people in the town.

438
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,200
M.

439
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Madeleine had arrived mysteriously in 
Montreuil one December evening in 1815.

440
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,940
He had no money but he had a revolutionary idea:  

441
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,460
he knew a cheap and efficient 
method of manufacturing glass.

442
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,900
Within a few months of his arrival, thanks to his  

443
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,900
new idea, the glass-making factory in 
Montreuil was making enormous profits.

444
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,780
With the money he made, M.

445
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,700
Madeleine built two new factories, which 
provided the town with hundreds of new jobs.

446
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,560
He became a very wealthy 
man but lived a simple life,  

447
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,060
using most of his money to 
build new hospitals and schools.

448
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:32,100
He was so popular that, in 1820, the 
townspeople elected him mayor of Montreuil.

449
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,680
There was one man, however, who did not like M.

450
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,580
Madeleine.

451
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,360
This was the chief of police, Inspector Javert.

452
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,320
He had always been suspicious of M.

453
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,780
Madeleine, and was sure that he had seen 
him somewhere before, many years earlier.

454
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:59,820
But he kept his suspicions to himself, not 
daring to say what he really believed: that M.

455
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,980
Madeleine was, in fact, a dangerous 
criminal with a terrible past.

456
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,600
Now, years later, M.

457
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,340
Madeleine was in the police station, 
trying to save Fantine from prison.

458
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,880
Fantine, however, was not grateful.

459
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,260
In fact, when she saw who it was, she spat at him.

460
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,540
'You own the factory where I used 
to work!' she shouted at him.

461
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,580
'I lost my job because of you.

462
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,580
Now I've become a bad woman,  

463
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,820
but what choice did I have? I'll never get 
my daughter back if I don't make money.'

464
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:49,320
The mayor turned to Inspector Javert and said, in 
a soft, firm voice, 'This woman must be released.'

465
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,820
'That's impossible,' Javert replied.

466
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,240
'She attacked a man in the 
street, a respectable citizen.

467
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,720
And now I've just seen her spit 
at you, the mayor of our town.

468
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,660
A woman like this deserves to be punished.'

469
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,820
'But I saw what happened 
in the street just now,' M.

470
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,200
Madeleine said.

471
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,680
'It was the man's fault, not this woman's.

472
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,440
You should arrest him, not her.'

473
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,280
Javert argued with M.

474
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,340
Madeleine for some time, but finally gave in.

475
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,920
He walked angrily out of the room, leaving 
the mayor and the prostitute alone together.

476
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,500
Fantine trembled, as confused as Javert had been.

477
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,520
The man who had just saved her from prison was 
also the man who had caused all her troubles.

478
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:48,180
The devil had suddenly decided to be 
kind, and she did not know what to think.

479
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,920
'I heard what you said,' M.

480
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,880
Madeleine said to her.

481
00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:00,120
'I honestly didn't know that you had lost 
your job, but I'll try to help you now.

482
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,340
I'll pay your debts and arrange 
for your child to return to you.

483
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,160
I'll give you all the money you need.

484
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,680
I'll make you happy again.

485
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,800
And I promise that, in the eyes of 
God, you have never been a bad woman.'

486
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,120
Fantine gazed at M.

487
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,680
Madeleine with tears in her eyes.

488
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,540
After all her pain and suffering she 
had, for the first time in her life,  

489
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,300
found kindness in another human being.

490
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,720
At last she would be cared for, and she could 
look forward to a life of happiness with Cosette.

491
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,360
Without a word, she fell to her 
knees and kissed the back of M.

492
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,080
Madeleine's hand.

493
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:45,900
M.

494
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:52,160
Madeleine sent the Thenardiers 300 francs and told 
them to send Cosette to Montreuil immediately.

495
00:38:52,160 --> 00:39:00,660
Thenardier, thinking that Fantine had suddenly 
become rich, wrote back and demanded 500 francs.

496
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,340
M.

497
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,820
Madeleine sent the money, but 
the Thenardiers found even more  

498
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,760
dishonest excuses for not sending Cosette back.

499
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,460
***

500
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,000
The weeks passed and, although she was happier  

501
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,900
than she had been for a long 
time, Fantine caught a fever.

502
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,100
Months of poverty and misery had made her ill,  

503
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,660
and she soon became so weak that 
she was unable to leave her bed.

504
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,300
'When shall I see Cosette?' she kept asking M.

505
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,220
Madeleine when he visited her.

506
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:40,740
'Very soon,' he would reply, and her 
pale face would light up with joy.

507
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,920
One morning, as M.

508
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,820
Madeleine was making preparations 
to leave for Montfermeil and to  

509
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,520
fetch Cosette himself, he had a visitor.

510
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,000
Inspector Javert walked into his office,  

511
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,960
and stood in silence waiting for 
him to look up from his work.

512
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,000
'Well, Javert, what is it?' M.

513
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,320
Madeleine finally said.

514
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,760
'I've come to apologize, M.

515
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,280
Madeleine,' the inspector replied.

516
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,680
'What are you talking about?'

517
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,680
'I've treated you unjustly.

518
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,420
I was angry with you six weeks ago 
when you told me to release that woman.

519
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:27,060
I wrote to the police headquarters 
in Paris and told them about you.'

520
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,800
'Told them what about me?'

521
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,520
'Forgive me, M.

522
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,920
Madeleine, but I believed you 
were a man called Jean Valjean.

523
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,300
He was a prisoner I saw twenty years 
ago, when I worked at a prison in Toulon.

524
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,120
After being released from prison, 
this Valjean stole some silver from  

525
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,780
the Bishop of Digne and robbed a 
small boy on a public footpath.

526
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,720
We tried to catch him, but he disappeared.

527
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,660
When you arrived in Montreuil, I 
felt sure that you were this man,  

528
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,740
but now I know I was wrong, and I'm sorry.

529
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,400
You will, of course, dismiss me from my job, 
as I've shown that I don't deserve your trust.'

530
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,680
M.

531
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,340
Madeleine, looking hard at Javert 
without expression, said quietly,  

532
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,240
'I'm afraid I don't understand.'

533
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,600
'The police headquarters in Paris told 
me that Jean Valjean was arrested last  

534
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,600
autumn for stealing apples,' Javert explained.

535
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,740
He'd changed his name to Champmathieu and had  

536
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,680
lived for several years in the 
village of Ailly-le-Haut-Cloche.

537
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,780
Two ex-prisoners from Toulon 
recognized him as Jean Valjean.

538
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:52,260
I visited the man in Arras prison, and I saw 
for myself that he is indeed Jean Valjean.

539
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,320
Of course, he denies everything, 
but that's not surprising.

540
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,240
If he's found guilty of stealing from the 
bishop - who, as you know, died a couple  

541
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,760
of years ago - and of robbing the small boy, 
he'll spend the rest of his life in prison.'

542
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,220
M.

543
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,780
Madeleine looked down at his papers.

544
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,880
'This matter is of no interest 
to me, Javert,' he said casually.

545
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,640
'I'm sure you have other work to do.'

546
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,280
'I was going to the man's trial 
in Arras tomorrow, 'Javert said.

547
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,460
'But after this conversation, 
you must dismiss me.'

548
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,020
M.

549
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,380
Madeleine rose to his feet.

550
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:35,580
'Javert,' he said, 'you're an honourable man.

551
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,240
You made one small mistake, that's all.

552
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,920
I want you to continue your excellent 
work as inspector of police.'

553
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,560
He offered Javert his hand, but 
the inspector refused to take it.

554
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,260
Instead, he said, 'I've behaved 
unjustly towards an innocent man.

555
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,600
I cannot shake his hand.'

556
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,020
With those words he bowed and 
left the office, leaving M.

557
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:09,000
Madeleine to stare at the papers on his desk 
with an empty, puzzled look in his eyes.

558
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,840
That afternoon, M.

559
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,640
Madeleine visited Fantine.

560
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:21,720
She had a high fever, and was coughing badly, 
but she still had only one thing on her mind.

561
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,040
'Cosette?' she asked him.

562
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,160
'Very soon,' he assured her.

563
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,420
He sat by her bed for an hour and then,  

564
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,080
having told the nurses to look 
after her, he returned to his home.

565
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:43,920
He stayed awake all night, thinking 
of Javert's story about Champmathieu.

566
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,320
The reader has probably already realized that M.

567
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:54,000
Madeleine was really Jean Valjean, and M.

568
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,280
Madeleine - as we shall continue to call 
him for this part of the story - knew  

569
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,840
that he could not let Champmathieu go to 
prison for crimes he had not committed.

570
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,480
He knew - although he was not 
happy to admit this - that he  

571
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,180
would have to go to Arras and tell the truth.

572
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,680
He would lose everything that he 
had worked so hard to achieve.

573
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:23,100
He would also have to break his promise to 
Fantine about bringing Cosette from Montfermeil.

574
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,340
But what choice did he have? The truth 
was more important than anything else.

575
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,740
***

576
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,360
The next morning, M.

577
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,240
Madeleine set off on the long journey to Arras.

578
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,760
It took him more than twelve hours,  

579
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,340
and when he arrived, he discovered that 
Champmathieu's trial had already started.

580
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,520
The courtroom was full but, because 
he was such an important man, M.

581
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,640
Madeleine was allowed to sit 
behind the judge's chair.

582
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,900
He watched as several witnesses swore on the Bible  

583
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,120
that the man standing before 
the judge was Jean Valjean.

584
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:09,660
Champmathieu, a large, simple-minded man, 
denied everything when his chance came to speak,  

585
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,660
but the crowd thought he was trying to be funny.

586
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,480
The courtroom filled with laughter and 
Champmathieu began to laugh himself,  

587
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,400
which did him no good at all.

588
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,820
Finally, having heard all the 
evidence, the judge called for silence.

589
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,040
He was preparing to announce his decision when M.

590
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:36,120
Madeleine, pale and trembling, stood up and said:

591
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,620
'That man is not Jean Valjean.'

592
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,980
An excited whisper went around the 
courtroom as everybody recognized M.

593
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,340
Madeleine.

594
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,260
M.

595
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,420
Madeleine waited for the whispers to stop  

596
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:57,600
before announcing in a loud, clear 
voice that he was Jean Valjean.

597
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:05,460
At first, no one believed him, but he managed to 
persuade the court by skilfully questioning each  

598
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:11,460
of the witnesses, revealing personal information 
that only the real Jean Valjean could have known.

599
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,260
When he had persuaded the court 
of the truth of his confession,  

600
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,220
he was faced with a shocked 
but respectful silence.

601
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,840
'I must leave now,' M.

602
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,100
Madeleine finally said.

603
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,340
'I have important business to attend to.

604
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,660
You know where to find me, and 
I shall not try to escape.'

605
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,440
Everybody stood to one side to let him 
pass as he made his way towards the door.

606
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,700
When he had gone, the judge immediately allowed 
Champmathieu to leave the court a free man.

607
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,620
Champmathieu went home in 
a state of total confusion,  

608
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,420
thinking all men mad and understanding 
nothing of what had happened.

609
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
***

610
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,120
At dawn the next day, M.

611
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,220
Madeleine entered Fantine's room.

612
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,860
'How is she?' he asked the nurse, 
who was watching her as she slept.

613
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,020
'She seems better.

614
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,900
She's looking forward to seeing her child.'

615
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,280
'I haven't brought the child with me,' M.

616
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,600
Madeleine said.

617
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:28,500
'Then what can we say to her when she wakes 
up?' The nurse looked suddenly worried.

618
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:33,600
'It will destroy her if she doesn't see her 
child now, after you promised to bring her.'

619
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,980
'God will guide me,' M.

620
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,760
Madeleine sighed.

621
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,520
For some time M.

622
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,120
Madeleine sat by the bedside and 
watched Fantine while she slept.

623
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,700
She was breathing with great difficulty, 
but her face looked peaceful and calm.

624
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,960
Suddenly, she opened her eyes and saw M.

625
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,560
Madeleine.

626
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:00,420
'Cosette?' she asked, with a soft smile.

627
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,060
'Later,' M.

628
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,820
Madeleine said gently, taking her hand.

629
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,180
'You're too weak to see her at the moment.

630
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,580
First you must get well.'

631
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:18,600
Fantine smiled, and began to talk dreamily 
about her future life with her daughter,  

632
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,700
and how happy they would be together.

633
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:27,420
But suddenly her face froze, and 
she stared with horror at the door.

634
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,400
M.

635
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,140
Madeleine, who was holding her hand, 
turned and saw Inspector Javert.

636
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:39,720
Fantine, thinking that the inspector 
had come for her, gripped M.

637
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,120
Madeleine's hand tightly and 
begged him to protect her.

638
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,700
'Don't be afraid.'

639
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,020
M.

640
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,520
Madeleine tried to calm her.

641
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,020
'He hasn't come for you.'

642
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:55,020
Then, gently rising from his 
chair, he moved towards Javert.

643
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,680
'I know what you've come for,' he said 
quietly so that Fantine wouldn't hear.

644
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,640
'But give me three days, please.

645
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,620
That's all I ask.

646
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,640
Three days to fetch this 
unfortunate woman's child.

647
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,320
I'll pay anything you like.'

648
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,200
'Do you think I'm stupid?' 
Javert gave an unpleasant laugh.

649
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,900
'Three days to escape, you mean.'

650
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,740
Fantine, who had heard what M.

651
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:29,940
Madeleine said, despite his efforts 
to speak quietly, began to tremble.

652
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,140
'To fetch my child?' she cried.

653
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:38,040
'Isn't she here? Nurse, answer me...

654
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:43,080
where's my little Cosette? I want to see her.

655
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:43,920
M.

656
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,520
Madeleine

657
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,580
'Be quiet, you dirty prostitute,' 
Javert interrupted her angrily.

658
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,640
'There is no Monsieur Madeleine.

659
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,320
This man's name is Jean Valjean, and 
he's a criminal no better than you are.

660
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,860
And you can forget all that 
nonsense about your child.

661
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,580
Fantine suddenly sat up.

662
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,320
She stared wildly at the two 
men, then turned to the nurse.

663
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,960
She looked as if she was going to 
speak, but no words came from her lips.

664
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:23,220
Instead, with a small sigh, she fell back 
against her pillow and lay completely still.

665
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:32,460
Jean Valjean (as we must now call him) shook 
Javert's hand from his collar and ran to the bed.

666
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:38,940
He gazed into Fantine's eyes and 
knew immediately that she was dead.

667
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:45,720
'You've killed her!' he cried angrily, turning 
to Javert with a fierce look in his eyes.

668
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,560
'I didn't come here to argue,' Javert said,  

669
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,400
stepping back nervously, afraid that 
Valjean was going to attack him.

670
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,600
'If you don't come with me 
now, I'll have to call my men.'

671
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,240
Valjean looked around the room, thinking 
for a second of making his escape.

672
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,540
But the idea did not last for long.

673
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:14,580
He turned again to Fantine and looked for one last 
time at her sad, pale face and empty, blue eyes.

674
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,160
Bending down, he closed her eyes and 
pressed his lips against her forehead.

675
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,180
Then he rose and turned back to Javert.

676
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,380
'I'm ready now,' he said.

677
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,440
News of M.

678
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,960
Madeleine's arrest spread quickly around the town.

679
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,560
Most people pretended not to be surprised.

680
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:42,120
'We always knew there was something 
strange about him,' they said.

681
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:49,260
Two days after his arrest, Jean 
Valjean escaped from prison.

682
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,340
The bars of his window had 
been broken during the night.

683
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,600
Again, most people pretended not to be surprised.

684
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:03,900
'It takes more than a small town prison to 
hold a man as strong as that,' they all agreed.

685
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,600
CHAPTER FOUR

686
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,780
The Man in the Long Yellow Coat

687
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:17,700
Christmas 1823 was especially lively and 
colourful in the village of Montfermeil.

688
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,680
Entertainers and traders from 
Paris set up their stalls in  

689
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,580
the streets, and business at the 
Thenardiers' inn was very good.

690
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,660
While guests and visitors ate and drank noisily,  

691
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:36,180
Cosette - now eight years old - sat in 
her usual place under the kitchen table.

692
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:42,600
Dressed in rags, she knitted woollen 
stockings for Eponine and Azelma.

693
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,420
One evening, Madame Thenardier ordered 
Cosette out into the cold to fetch water.

694
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:54,900
The nearest water supply was half-way down 
the wooded hill on which Montfermeil stood,  

695
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,920
and Cosette hated fetching 
water, especially in the dark.

696
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,160
Miserably, she picked up a large, empty 
bucket that was almost as big as she was,  

697
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,420
and was walking with it to the door 
when Madame Thenardier stopped her.

698
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,220
'Buy some bread on the way,' she 
said, giving the girl some money.

699
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,200
Cosette took the coin, put it 
carefully in her pocket and left.

700
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:25,440
She was cold and hungry as she dragged the 
bucket behind her along the crowded street,  

701
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,460
but she could not resist stopping 
in front of one of the stalls.

702
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:35,820
It was like a palace to her, with its bright 
lights, shining glass and pretty objects.

703
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:40,800
But the object that most attracted 
Cosette's attention was a large,  

704
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,580
golden-haired doll in a beautiful long pink dress.

705
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,920
All the children in Montfermeil 
had gazed with wonder at this doll,  

706
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,520
but nobody in the village 
had enough money to buy it.

707
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,480
Cosette gazed at the doll for several minutes  

708
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:02,580
but, remembering her job, she 
sighed and continued on her way.

709
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,700
She had soon left the colourful lights and 
the happy laughter of the village behind her,  

710
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,540
and was running down the hill into 
the frightening darkness of the wood.

711
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:18,360
Finding the stream, she bent forward 
and began to till her bucket.

712
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:23,820
She did not notice the coin that 
Mme Thenardier had given her for  

713
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:27,060
the bread fall out of her pocket into the water.

714
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:32,460
When the bucket was full, she 
gripped the handle with her tiny,  

715
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,120
frozen hands and tried to 
pull it back up the hill.

716
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,480
But the bucket was so heavy that, after a 
dozen steps, she had to stop for a rest.

717
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,920
She managed a few more steps, and stopped again.

718
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,940
Her progress became slower and slower.

719
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:57,060
She was almost at the end of her strength, 
and she was still not out of the wood.

720
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,680
Leaning against a tree, she cried aloud:

721
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,180
'Oh God help me! Please, dear God!'

722
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:15,180
Suddenly, an enormous hand reached down from 
the sky and took the bucket of water from her.

723
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:21,540
Looking up, Cosette saw a huge, 
white-haired man standing next to her.

724
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,480
He looked very strange with his 
tall black hat and long yellow coat.

725
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:34,680
'This is a very heavy bucket for 
such a small child,' he said gently,  

726
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,140
looking down at her from his great height.

727
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,700
For some reason, Cosette was not afraid.

728
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:48,540
There was something about his eyes, tilled with 
a strange sadness, that she liked and trusted.

729
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:54,600
She let him carry the bucket up the hill 
and, as they walked back towards the village,  

730
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,380
she told him everything about 
her life with the Thenardiers.

731
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,200
The old man listened with great 
interest, and asked her many questions.

732
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,300
As they were approaching the inn, 
Cosette turned to him and said,  

733
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:17,340
'May I have the bucket now? If Mme Thenardier sees 
that someone has been helping me, she'll beat me.'

734
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,380
The old man gave her the bucket, 
and they entered the inn together.

735
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:28,920
'What took you so long?' Mme Thenardier 
said angrily when she saw the little girl.

736
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,780
'This gentleman wants a room for the night,'  

737
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,560
Cosette said, trembling with 
fear, expecting to be beaten.

738
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,760
Mme Thenardier glanced at 
the old man without interest.

739
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,080
She could tell from his clothes 
that he probably had no money.

740
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,160
'I'm sorry, the rooms are full,' she said.

741
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,080
'I can pay the price of a room,' the old man said.

742
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,620
'Forty sous,' Mme Thenardier replied 
(although the usual price was twenty).

743
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,980
'Forty sous,' the man agreed.

744
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,300
He sat down and Cosette, after serving him some 
wine, returned to her place under the table.

745
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:20,520
But before she could start her knitting, she 
heard Mme Thenardier's angry voice demanding,  

746
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,500
'Where's the bread I told you to get?'

747
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,840
Cosette, who had forgotten about the 
bread, came out from under the table.

748
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,980
'The baker's was shut,' she lied.

749
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,080
'Well, give me back the money.'

750
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:39,120
Cosette felt in her pocket and suddenly went pale.

751
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,340
The coin was not there.

752
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,780
'I'm waiting,' Mme Thenardier said threateningly.

753
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:52,020
Cosette said nothing, speechless with fear 
as the woman raised her arm to hit her.

754
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:56,880
But before she could deliver the blow the old 
man, who had seen everything, interrupted her.

755
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,440
'Madame, I've just noticed this on the floor.

756
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,500
It must have fallen from the child's pocket.'

757
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,680
Mme Thenardier took the coin the old 
man held towards her and walked away.

758
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:17,100
At that moment the door opened 
and Eponine and Azelma appeared.

759
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,480
They were two healthy girls, the old man noticed,  

760
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,080
dressed in warm clothes and 
with pink, healthy cheeks.

761
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:30,660
After hugging and kissing their mother, they sat 
on the floor by the fire and played with a doll.

762
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,740
Cosette, who had returned to 
her place under the table,  

763
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,560
looked up from her knitting 
and watched them sadly.

764
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,120
A short time later, the girls 
grew bored with their game.

765
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:46,700
They left the doll on the floor and 
went off to play with a baby cat.

766
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:52,800
Cosette, checking that no one was watching, 
reached out and picked up the doll.

767
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,340
She turned her back on the 
room and began to play with it,  

768
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,860
hoping that no one could see what she was doing.

769
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,400
Her happiness did not last long, however.

770
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:08,700
The two girls, when they saw Cosette with 
their doll, ran crying to their mother.

771
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:13,500
Mme Thenardier rushed across 
the room towards Cosette who,  

772
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:18,480
afraid that she would be punished, put the 
doll gently on the floor and began to cry.

773
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,700
'What's the matter?' the old 
man said, rising to his feet.

774
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:28,260
'Can't you see?' Mme Thenardier 
said, red with anger.

775
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:33,000
'That nasty little girl, who isn't 
even my own daughter, who I feed and  

776
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,500
look after out of the kindness of my heart, 
has been playing with my daughters' doll.'

777
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,480
'I don't understand,' the old man said.

778
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,420
'She's touched it with her dirty hands!'  

779
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:51,900
Then, hearing Cosette crying, she turned to 
the little girl and shouted, 'Stop that noise!'

780
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:59,640
The old man left the inn and, minutes 
later, returned with something in his hands:  

781
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,780
the beautiful doll from the stall across the road.

782
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:10,140
'Here,' he said softly, placing it 
gently on the floor in front of Cosette.

783
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,000
'It's for you.'

784
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,780
There was a sudden silence in the room.

785
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,880
Mme Thenardier, Eponine and 
Azelma stood absolutely still.

786
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:27,660
The drinkers at the other tables paused, glasses 
half-way to their lips, and stared with disbelief.

787
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,500
'What kind of man is this?' they thought.

788
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:37,200
'He dresses so poorly but can afford to buy 
the most expensive doll in Montfermeil!'

789
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:42,660
The Thenardiers gave the old man 
their best room for the night.

790
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,840
The next morning they gave him the bill,  

791
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:50,760
charging him three times the usual price 
for a meal and a bed for the night.

792
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,380
They waited nervously while the 
man studied the bill carefully,  

793
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,020
expecting him to complain or cause trouble.

794
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,760
Finally, he looked up from the 
bill without expression and said,  

795
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:08,100
'Tell me, is business good here in Montfermeil?'

796
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,980
'Times are very hard,' Mme 
Thenardier replied immediately.

797
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,600
'This is a poor country.

798
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,540
I don't know how we would manage without the  

799
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,880
occasional rich and generous 
traveller like yourself.

800
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,060
We have so many expenses.

801
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:28,320
That child, for instance - you've 
no idea how much she costs.

802
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,900
We have our own daughters to look after.

803
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,380
I can't afford to look after 
other people's children, too.'

804
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:40,440
'What would you say,' the old man 
said after a moment's thought,  

805
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:44,220
'if I offered to take the child from you?'

806
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:49,080
'Oh!' Madame Thenardiers face brightened.

807
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,120
'That would be wonderful.'

808
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,240
'Just a minute,' her husband said.

809
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,520
'We love that child very much.

810
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:02,280
It's true we're poor, and we have bad debts, 
but love is more important than money.'

811
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:10,080
'How much do you need?' the old man asked, taking 
an old leather wallet from the pocket of his coat.

812
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:16,740
'1500 francs,' Thenardier, who had 
already done his arithmetic, replied.

813
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:25,680
The old man put three 500-franc notes on the table 
and said, without smiling, 'Now fetch Cosette.'

814
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:32,460
When Cosette came downstairs, the 
old man gave her new clothes to wear:  

815
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:36,600
a black woollen dress, black 
stockings, scarf and shoes.

816
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:43,680
Half an hour later, the people of Montfermeil 
saw an old man in a tall hat and long yellow  

817
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:50,400
coat walking along the road to Paris, hand-in-hand 
with a little girl dressed completely in black.

818
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,800
No one knew the man.

819
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,360
And, because she was carrying 
an expensive doll and was no  

820
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:01,260
longer wearing rags, not many recognized Cosette.

821
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,860
Cosette was leaving at last.

822
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,940
She did not know where to, or with whom.

823
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:14,520
But, as she held the old man's hand, 
she gazed wide-eyed at the sky.

824
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:21,780
She had the strange but comforting feeling 
that she was somehow travelling closer to God.

825
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,440
CHAPTER FOUR

826
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,260
Valjean and Cosette

827
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,640
Somewhere on the outskirts of Paris, 
Jean Valjean stopped outside a large,  

828
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,740
ancient building with damp walls.

829
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:43,440
He took a key from the pocket of his long 
yellow coat and opened the old wooden door.

830
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:51,000
He then carried Cosette, who was sleeping in 
his arms, along a dark corridor and up some  

831
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,480
stairs to the room he had rented 
since his escape from Montreuil.

832
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,280
There was not much furniture 
in the room - just an old bed,  

833
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:04,320
a mattress on the floor, a table, 
some chairs and a lighted stove.

834
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:10,440
A streetlamp shone through the only window, 
lighting the dark interior of the room.

835
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:15,660
Valjean laid Cosette on 
the bed without waking her.

836
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:19,620
He lit a candle and sat by the 
bed, watching her while she slept.

837
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:24,360
He felt sad that Fantine had not 
lived to see her child again,  

838
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:29,280
but happy that he had been able to rescue 
her child from the terrible Thenardiers.

839
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,840
He bent and kissed the sleeping child's forehead  

840
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,500
just as, nine months earlier, 
he had kissed her mother's.

841
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:44,280
The next morning, Cosette opened her eyes 
and immediately started to get out of bed.

842
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:49,140
'I'm coming, Madame,' she yawned, blinded  

843
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:52,200
by the bright winter's sunlight 
that was shining into the room.

844
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,160
Then, as her eyes adjusted to the light,  

845
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:02,340
she saw the kind old face of Jean Valjean 
looking down at her, and she relaxed.

846
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,120
'Of course!' she cried with joy.

847
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,320
'It's all true.

848
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,140
I was afraid that it was just a dream.'

849
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,120
She hugged her doll and asked 
Valjean hundreds of questions.

850
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,040
Finally, she asked him, 'Do you 
want me to sweep the floor?'

851
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,320
'No,' he said.

852
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,840
'I just want you to enjoy yourself.'

853
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:31,740
The December days passed in great happiness 
for Cosette and for Jean Valjean, too.

854
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,280
For twenty-five years he 
had been alone in the world.

855
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,080
Nothing had ever touched his heart 
until he had rescued Cosette.

856
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:45,900
Now, he discovered the greatest joy 
he had ever known by just standing  

857
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,620
beside her bed and looking at her 
innocent, trusting little face.

858
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,500
He had discovered love.

859
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,080
***

860
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:59,400
After escaping from Montreuil, 
Jean Valjean had taken all his  

861
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:03,600
money from the bank and buried 
it in a forest near Montfermeil.

862
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:10,800
Although he was rich, he had chosen a room in a 
poor part of Paris, where nobody would find him.

863
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:16,500
His only neighbour was an old woman, who did 
his housework and kept his stove burning.

864
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:22,320
Paying her six months in advance, he told 
her that he was a ruined Spanish gentleman,  

865
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,960
and that the little girl was his granddaughter.

866
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,460
Weeks passed, and the two lived happily.

867
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:33,240
Valjean gave Cosette lessons 
in reading and writing,  

868
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:37,140
and spent hours watching her as 
she dressed and undressed her doll.

869
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,940
To avoid being seen, he never 
went out during the day.

870
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:48,120
He walked for a couple of hours every evening, 
sometimes alone, sometimes with Cosette.

871
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:52,140
He often gave money to beggars, which was unwise,  

872
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:57,540
because he soon became known in the area 
as 'the beggar who gives money to beggars'.

873
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,080
One evening, towards the end of winter,  

874
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:06,300
Valjean gave some money to a beggar sitting 
under a streetlamp outside a church.

875
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:12,300
The beggar raised his face and stared 
hard at Valjean for just a second,  

876
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,760
then quickly bowed his head.

877
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,880
This gave Valjean a shock.

878
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:24,120
Although he had only seen the beggar's face 
for a second, it had seemed strangely familiar.

879
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,620
'I'm going mad,' he thought, as he walked home.

880
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:33,720
The next evening he returned to 
the steetlamp outside the church.

881
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:38,880
The beggar was still there, in the same 
position, wearing the same clothes.

882
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:43,260
This time, Valjean spoke to 
him as he gave him some money.

883
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:49,200
The beggar laughed and joked with him, and 
Valjean returned that evening a happier man.

884
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:54,660
'I must have been dreaming 
yesterday,' he laughed to himself.

885
01:07:55,380 --> 01:08:01,620
'But for a second, there was something about 
the beggars eyes that reminded me of Javert.

886
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:07,080
How could I have thought such a thing? 
After speaking to him this evening,  

887
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,260
I can see that he doesn't look 
like the inspector at all.'

888
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:16,260
A few evenings later, while he was 
giving Cosette a reading lesson in  

889
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:20,880
his room, Valjean heard the front 
door of the house open and close.

890
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:23,040
This was unusual.

891
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:29,100
The old woman, the only other person who lived in 
the building, always went to bed before nightfall.

892
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,060
Valjean signalled to Cosette to keep quiet.

893
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,240
Someone was coming up the stairs.

894
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:43,560
He blew out the candle and, just as he was kissing 
Cosette on the forehead, the footsteps stopped.

895
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,900
Valjean did not move.

896
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,160
He sat in his chair with his back 
to the door and held his breath.

897
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:55,860
A few minutes later, having heard 
only silence, he turned round.

898
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,640
A light was shining through a crack in his door.

899
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:04,560
Someone with a candle was 
standing outside his room.

900
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:10,020
Several minutes passed, and 
then the light disappeared.

901
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:17,940
Valjean quietly lay down on the mattress on his 
floor, but he could not close his eyes all night.

902
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,200
At daybreak, as he was falling asleep at last,  

903
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:26,280
he heard footsteps in the 
corridor outside his room again.

904
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:30,780
Running to the door, he put 
his eye to the large keyhole  

905
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,820
and saw the back view of a man who 
was walking towards the stairs.

906
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:40,260
A tall man in a long coat 
with a stick under his arm.

907
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,440
Valjean's heart almost stopped 
beating and he began to sweat.

908
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,180
'Javert,' he breathed to himself.

909
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:51,605
***

910
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:56,160
Valjean spent all day making 
preparations to leave.

911
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,360
It was too dangerous for him and 
Cosette to stay there another night.

912
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,400
That evening, he went downstairs 
and looked up and down the street.

913
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:11,100
It seemed empty, although he could not 
see into the shadows behind the trees.

914
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:17,100
He went back upstairs for Cosette, who was 
waiting for him patiently, holding her doll.

915
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,160
'Come along,' he said.

916
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,960
'It's time to leave.'

917
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:26,700
Cosette took his hand, and 
went with him down the stairs.

918
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:34,200
There was a full moon, and this pleased Valjean 
as he moved quickly along the narrow streets.

919
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:40,860
By keeping close to the walls in the shadows, he 
could clearly see what was happening in the light.

920
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:46,200
After a while, he felt confident that 
he and Cosette were not being followed.

921
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:52,800
But, as the church bells of the city struck 
eleven o'clock, something made him look back.

922
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:59,940
In the light of a lamp above a doorway, he saw 
four men moving along the street in his direction.

923
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,380
He gripped Cosette's hand and 
began to walk more quickly.

924
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:11,280
Every few minutes, he stopped in the shadows of a 
doorway or at the corner of a street to look back.

925
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,460
The four men were still following him.

926
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:21,900
He could see their faces clearly in the moonlight, 
and one of them belonged to Inspector Javert.

927
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:26,100
By now, Cosette was exhausted.

928
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,060
Valjean picked her up and ran with her through a  

929
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,940
confusing system of alleys 
until he came to a bridge.

930
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:40,200
On the other side of the river, he stopped at the 
entrance of a high-walled alley and looked back.

931
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,940
He could see four figures in the 
distance on the far side of the bridge.

932
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,280
Walking more slowly now, thinking 
he was safe from his pursuers,  

933
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:55,500
Valjean followed the alley until he came to a 
lane that seemed to lead away from the city.

934
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:01,080
He walked along this lane for a 
long time until, to his horror,  

935
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,960
he discovered his way blocked by a high wall.

936
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:08,880
There was no way forward, 
but as he was turning back,  

937
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,660
he saw movements in the distance 
and the flash of moonlight on metal.

938
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:18,420
Seven or eight soldiers were moving 
slowly along the lane in his direction.

939
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:24,120
Valjean looked desperately for an escape 
from the alley, but could see none.

940
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:30,300
On one side of him was a tall building, all 
its doors and windows covered with metal bars.

941
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:34,080
On the other side there was 
a wall, higher than a tree.

942
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,540
He would be able to climb the wall on 
his own, but how could he carry Cosette?  

943
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,540
Suddenly, he had an idea.

944
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:49,080
He ran to a nearby streetlight and pulled 
some wire from a metal box at its base.

945
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:53,940
He tied one end of the wire 
around Cosette's waist,  

946
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:59,760
climbed the wall and, with great 
difficulty, pulled the girl up behind him.

947
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,040
He was only just in time.

948
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,220
There was a tree on the other side of the wall,  

949
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:11,580
and Valjean carried Cosette down into its 
branches just as the soldiers arrived.

950
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:17,640
'He must be here!' He heard Javert's voice 
clearly on the other side of the wall.

951
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,500
'He can't have escaped.

952
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,580
There's no way out!'

953
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:27,240
At last, the soldiers gave up their search 
and went back in the direction they had come.

954
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:34,680
Valjean hugged Cosette tightly with relief, 
knowing that at last they were both safe.

955
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,260
CHAPTER SIX

956
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:38,760
Marius

957
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:47,340
On the night after the Battle of Waterloo, 
in June 1815, a robber moved quietly  

958
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:51,960
around the battlefield, stealing money and 
jewellery from the bodies of dead soldiers.

959
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:56,520
He saw a hand sticking out from 
a pile of dead men and horses,  

960
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,120
a gold ring on its middle 
finger, shining in the moonlight.

961
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:07,020
The robber took the ring but, as he turned 
to leave, the hand grabbed his jacket.

962
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:13,080
The robber pulled the body from the pile of bodies 
and saw that he had rescued a French officer.

963
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:17,400
The man had a terrible wound in 
his head, but he was still alive.

964
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,540
'Thank you,' the officer whispered.

965
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,880
'You've saved my life.

966
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,120
What's your name?'

967
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:30,000
'Thenardier,' the robber replied.

968
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,980
'I shall not forget that 
name,' the officer replied.

969
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,100
'And you must remember mine.

970
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:41,280
My name's Pontmercy.'

971
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:47,100
Without another word, the robber took 
the wounded man's watch and purse,  

972
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,140
and disappeared into the night.

973
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:54,540
Georges Pontmercy was married with a young son.

974
01:14:55,200 --> 01:15:00,840
He survived the Battle of Waterloo but 
unfortunately, in the same year, his wife died.

975
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:03,870
His father-in-law, M.

976
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:08,460
Gillenormand, was a very wealthy man, 
but the two men hated each other.

977
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:10,980
M.

978
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:13,260
Gillenormand hated everybody who liked Napoleon.

979
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,860
He thought that Pontmercy 
was no better than a beggar,  

980
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:19,560
a penniless adventurer who only wanted his money.

981
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:23,160
Pontmercy thought that M.

982
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,300
Gillenormand was an old fool.

983
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:26,747
When his daughter died, M.

984
01:15:26,747 --> 01:15:31,920
Gillenormand made Pontmercy an 
offer which he could not refuse.

985
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:37,020
'You have no money, and I am rich,' he said.

986
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:42,360
'If you want to keep your son, 
Marius, I'll give you no money.

987
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:49,740
But if you give the boy to me, and promise 
never to see him again, I'll look after him.'

988
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:57,000
Pontmercy, wanting his son to have a 
good life, had sadly given him to M.

989
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,360
Gillenormand and never saw his 
son or father-in-law again.

990
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:06,660
Marius grew up with his grandfather, 
and never knew his father.

991
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:06,740
M.

992
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:11,700
Gillenormand always told him that 
his father had been no good - that  

993
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,900
he was a poor soldier and a drunk who had 
abandoned him after his mother's death.

994
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:23,520
For many years, Marius believed this, but when 
he was seventeen years old, he learnt the truth.

995
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:28,620
His father, a brave officer who had 
fought for Napoleon and nearly died  

996
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:33,360
at the Battle of Waterloo, had really 
loved him and his mother very much.

997
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:36,180
Without telling his grandfather,  

998
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:41,400
Marius tried to contact his father and 
finally discovered where he was living.

999
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:46,260
He went at once to visit him, but he was too late.

1000
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,060
His father had just died.

1001
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:54,960
A poor man, Georges Pontmercy had left 
his son nothing apart from a letter:

1002
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,940
For my son.

1003
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,960
My life was saved at Waterloo by a sergeant.

1004
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,420
His name was Thenardier.

1005
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:10,860
I believe that he recently managed a small inn in 
the village of Montfermeil, not far from Paris.

1006
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:17,160
If you ever find this man, I want 
you to help him in any way you can.

1007
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:24,540
Marius returned to Paris, but continued 
to visit his father's grave regularly,  

1008
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,220
without telling his grandfather.

1009
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,720
One day, however, his grandfather 
discovered what he was doing.

1010
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,260
They had a big quarrel, and M.

1011
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:36,300
Gillenormand ordered Marius to leave his house.

1012
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,400
***

1013
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:44,160
For the next three years, Marius lived in a 
small room in an old, damp-walled building on the  

1014
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:50,700
outskirts of Paris - the same room that Valjean 
and Cosette had lived in eight years earlier.

1015
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:55,440
He gave up studying law and 
earned his living by working  

1016
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,720
in a bookshop and helping to write dictionaries.

1017
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:03,660
He did not earn very much money, but it 
was enough for the rent and simple meals.

1018
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:09,300
He rarely bought new clothes, but he was proud 
of the fact that he had never been in debt.

1019
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:15,000
His grandfather often tried to send him 
money, but Marius always returned it.

1020
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:21,000
He hated his grandfather for the unjust, 
cruel way he had treated his poor father.

1021
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:27,780
Life was hard for him, but he never forgot 
the promise he had made his father: that he  

1022
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:34,140
would find Thenardier, the man who had saved his 
father's life, and help him in any way he could.

1023
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:40,260
Marius was a handsome young man, 
but he was also extremely shy.

1024
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:45,720
When girls looked at him and smiled, he 
thought they were laughing at his old clothes.

1025
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:52,440
In fact, they were attracted by his good looks, 
but he was not confident enough to realize this.

1026
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:58,320
As a result, he had no girlfriend, 
but he was happy with his books.

1027
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:05,040
'You shouldn't stay alone all the time,' 
his good friend, Enjolras, said to him.

1028
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,360
'You should get out more.

1029
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,160
Give the girls a chance.

1030
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:10,740
They'd be good for you, Marius.

1031
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:13,140
Otherwise you'll turn into a priest!'

1032
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,860
Marius paid little attention to his friend,  

1033
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:21,660
and continued his quiet life 
of work, study and daily walks.

1034
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:25,440
While walking around his part of the city,  

1035
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:30,480
Marius had noticed in elderly man and 
a young girl in the Luxembourg Gardens.

1036
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,960
They always sat next to each 
other on the same bench.

1037
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:40,380
The man, who was perhaps sixty, had white 
hair and a serious but friendly-looking face.

1038
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:47,040
The girl, who was aged thirteen or fourteen, 
always wore the same badly-cut black dress.

1039
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:53,940
She was very thin, almost ugly, but Marius 
noticed that she had lovely blue eyes.

1040
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,700
They seemed to be father and daughter.

1041
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:02,760
Marius saw this couple frequently 
on his regular walks in the Gardens.

1042
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,740
But, although he was very interested in 
them, they seemed not to notice him at all.

1043
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:12,900
The girl was always talking happily, 
while the man said very little.

1044
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:18,620
He just looked at the girl from time to 
time with an affectionate, fatherly smile.

1045
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:22,320
Enjolras had often seen the couple, too.

1046
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,540
'Do you know who they are?' 
Marius asked him one day.

1047
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,720
'I call the man M.

1048
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,520
Leblanc, because of his white hair,  

1049
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:38,700
and the girl Mile Lanoire, because of 
her black dress,' his friend replied.

1050
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,040
***

1051
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,400
For almost a year, Marius saw the old man and  

1052
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,400
the young girl daily in the 
same place at the same time.

1053
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,740
Then, for some reason, Marius stopped 
going to the Luxembourg Gardens.

1054
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:57,240
When he returned, one summer 
morning six months later,  

1055
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:03,960
he saw the same couple sitting on the same 
bench, but something amazing had happened.

1056
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,220
The man was the same, but the thin,  

1057
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:12,540
plain girl of six months earlier 
had become a beautiful young woman.

1058
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:18,120
Her rough black dress had been 
replaced by one of fine black silk.

1059
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:22,200
She had soft brown hair, pale, smooth skin,  

1060
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:27,480
deep blue eyes and a lovely smile 
that lit up her face like sunshine.

1061
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:34,080
She looked up when Marius passed for the 
second time, and gave him a casual glance.

1062
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:38,340
Marius, however, walked on, 
thinking of other things.

1063
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:43,920
For the next few days he passed the bench 
in the Gardens without looking at her.

1064
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:48,840
Then one day, as he was passing, 
thinking about nothing in particular,  

1065
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,380
the girl looked up at him and their eyes met.

1066
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:59,640
A second later she looked away and 
Marius walked on but, in a strange way,  

1067
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,400
he knew his life had changed.

1068
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:07,980
What he had experienced in that moment was 
not the honest, innocent gaze of a child.

1069
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,440
It was something more than that.

1070
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:17,700
Whatever it was, Marius sensed that, after 
that moment, his life would never be the same.

1071
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,880
The next day, Marius returned to the 
Luxembourg Gardens wearing his best clothes.

1072
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,500
He walked around slowly, stopping 
to look at the ducks on the lake,  

1073
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:34,500
then casually approached the bench where 
Mile Lanoire and her father were sitting.

1074
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:41,820
As he walked past, he kept his eyes fixed on 
the girl, but she did not seem to notice him.

1075
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:48,300
She was talking quietly to her father, and Marius 
could hear the soft, exciting murmur of her voice.

1076
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:55,080
Without intending to, he stopped, turned 
round and walked past the bench again.

1077
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,880
He felt his face go red and his 
heart beat loudly in his chest.

1078
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:03,660
He was sure, this time, that she 
had watched him as he passed.

1079
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:10,140
He did not go back a third time, but sat down 
on a bench at the opposite end of the Gardens.

1080
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:13,680
He looked at the girl out 
of the corner of his eye.

1081
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:18,600
She seemed to fill the far end of 
the Gardens with a kind of blue mist.

1082
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:25,740
Taking a deep breath, he rose and was going to 
pass the bench for a third time when he stopped.

1083
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:31,680
He suddenly realized that, in his feverish 
state, he had forgotten about the old man.

1084
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:37,020
What would he be thinking when he saw a 
strange young man walking backwards and  

1085
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:43,980
forwards in front of his bench? Without another 
thought, Marius left the Gardens and went home.

1086
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:51,180
He returned the next morning and sat on a 
bench all day, pretending to read a book,  

1087
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:55,080
not daring to go near the bench where 
the girl and her father were sitting.

1088
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:59,220
He did the same every day for two weeks.

1089
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:01,920
Towards the end of the second week,  

1090
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,540
while Marius was sitting in his usual 
place, he looked up from his book.

1091
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,520
And his face went pale.

1092
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,000
Something had happened at 
the far end of the Gardens.

1093
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:13,620
M.

1094
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:18,720
Leblanc and his daughter had risen from their 
bench and were slowly walking in his direction.

1095
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:24,420
Marius shut his book, opened it 
again and made an effort to read.

1096
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:30,960
When he felt that they were near him, 
he looked up and saw that the girl was  

1097
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:37,200
looking steadily at him with a soft, thoughtful 
gaze that made him tremble from head to foot.

1098
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:41,460
He gazed after her until she 
had disappeared from sight,  

1099
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:46,380
then rose to his feet and walked 
around, laughing and talking to himself.

1100
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:51,300
Finally he left the Gardens in the 
mad hope of seeing her in the street,  

1101
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,100
but instead he met Enjolras, 
who invited him to a meal.

1102
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:03,420
Every day for the next month, Marius went to 
the Luxembourg Gardens, excited by knowing  

1103
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:08,760
that the girl was secretly looking at him, but 
too shy and embarrassed to know what to do.

1104
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:13,920
He avoided walking directly in front 
of the bench, partly from shyness,  

1105
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,400
partly because he did not want to 
attract her father's attention.

1106
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,920
Sometimes he stood for half an hour in a 
place where her father could not see him,  

1107
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:27,660
looking at her and enjoying the 
small, secret smiles she sent him.

1108
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:31,080
But it seemed that M.

1109
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:34,980
Leblanc had begun to suspect 
what was happening because often,  

1110
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:40,620
when Marius appeared, he got to his feet and 
walked away, taking his daughter with him.

1111
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,020
Sometimes M.

1112
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:47,100
Leblanc took his daughter to a different 
bench, to see if Marius would follow them.

1113
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:53,220
Marius failed to understand the trick, 
and made the mistake of doing so.

1114
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,560
Then M.

1115
01:25:55,560 --> 01:26:00,120
Leblanc became irregular in his visits and 
did not always bring his daughter with him.

1116
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:06,240
When this happened, Marius did not stay 
in the Gardens, which was another mistake.

1117
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,440
Marius was too much in love to think clearly.

1118
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:15,960
His desire for the girl was growing 
daily, and he dreamt of her every night.

1119
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:21,360
One evening, he found a handkerchief 
lying on the bench which M.

1120
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,220
Leblanc and his daughter had just left.

1121
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:28,980
It was a plain, white handkerchief 
with the initials U.F.

1122
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,480
in one corner.

1123
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:32,640
'Ursula.'

1124
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:36,120
Marius said the first name 
that came into his head.

1125
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,740
'A delicious name!'

1126
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:42,000
He kissed the handkerchief, 
breathed in its perfume,  

1127
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,080
wore it next to his heart by day and 
kept it under his pillow at night.

1128
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:51,120
'I can feel her whole soul in it!' he told himself

1129
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:55,200
In fact, the handkerchief belonged to M.

1130
01:26:55,200 --> 01:27:00,360
Leblanc and had simply fallen out of his 
pocket, but Marius was unaware of this.

1131
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:04,080
He never appeared in the 
Luxembourg Gardens without  

1132
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,720
the handkerchief pressed to his lips or his heart.

1133
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:13,080
The girl could not understand his behaviour at 
all, and looked at him with a puzzled expression.

1134
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:17,340
'Such modesty!' Marius sighed.

1135
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:22,740
Eventually, Marius was not satisfied 
with just knowing the girl's name;  

1136
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:24,960
he wanted to know where she lived.

1137
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:30,780
He found that she lived in a small house 
at the quiet end of the rue de l'Ouest.

1138
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:36,420
As well as the joy of seeing her in the Gardens, 
he now had the pleasure of following her home.

1139
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:40,980
One evening, having followed them 
to the house and watched them enter,  

1140
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:44,880
he went in after them and spoke to the concierge.

1141
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,540
The concierge, however, became suspicious,  

1142
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:53,760
thinking that Marius was connected with 
the police, and refused to say anything.

1143
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,300
The following day, M.

1144
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:00,420
Leblanc and his daughter did 
not come to the Gardens at all.

1145
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:05,460
They did not come for a whole week, 
and Marius began to feel depressed.

1146
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:11,340
Every night he stood outside their house 
and gazed up at their lighted windows.

1147
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:16,980
Sometimes he saw a shadow pass in front 
of a lamp, and his heart beat faster.

1148
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:21,840
On the eighth night there 
was no light in the windows.

1149
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:27,360
Marius waited, his heart aching 
with pain, until finally going home.

1150
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,900
The next day they did not go to the Gardens,  

1151
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:34,560
so again Marius went to the 
house as night was falling.

1152
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,100
Once again, there were no lights in the windows.

1153
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,880
He knocked on the door and spoke to the concierge.

1154
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,960
'Where's the old gentleman?' he asked.

1155
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:47,580
'He's left.'

1156
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,360
Marius felt the blood leave his face.

1157
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:57,240
Almost fainting, he asked in a 
weak voice, 'When did he leave?'

1158
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:58,800
'Yesterday.'

1159
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:01,020
'Where has he gone?'

1160
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,460
'I've no idea.'

1161
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,320
'Did he leave an address?'

1162
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,480
The concierge then recognized 
Marius from the previous week.

1163
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:15,840
He stared fiercely at him and said, 
'So, it's you again! I was right.

1164
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,180
You are some kind of policeman.'

1165
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:23,220
With those words he slammed 
the door in Marius's face.

1166
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,780
CHAPTER SEVEN

1167
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:29,100
The Jondrettes

1168
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:36,480
Summer and autumn passed, and winter 
came, but Marius saw no sign of M.

1169
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,100
Leblanc or 'Ursula'.

1170
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:41,580
He searched everywhere for 
them, but without success.

1171
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:47,160
He became like a homeless dog, wandering 
the streets in a mood of dark despair.

1172
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:53,160
Without 'Ursula', his life had become 
meaningless, work disgusted him,  

1173
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:57,360
walking tired him, solitude bored him.

1174
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:02,160
'If only I hadn't followed 
them home,' he told himself.

1175
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:06,360
'It gave me so much happiness 
just to look at her, and now,  

1176
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,820
through my stupidity, I've lost even that.'

1177
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:15,360
Enjolras and his other friends tried to 
cheer him up by taking him to exciting  

1178
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:19,260
places, but these expeditions 
always ended in the same way:  

1179
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:25,260
Marius would leave the group and walk around 
the streets of Paris unhappily on his own.

1180
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,120
One cold but sunny afternoon in February,  

1181
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:36,240
Marius was walking along the street when two 
young girls dressed in rags ran into him.

1182
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,840
One was tall and thin, the other smaller.

1183
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:45,000
From what they were shouting at each other, he 
understood that they were running from the police.

1184
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:50,460
He stood for a moment staring after 
them as they disappeared round a corner.

1185
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,620
Then he noticed a small parcel 
of papers lying on the ground.

1186
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:59,820
Realizing that one of the 
girls must have dropped it,  

1187
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:04,020
he picked it up and called 
after them, but it was too late.

1188
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:06,960
The girls had already disappeared from sight.

1189
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:12,600
With a sigh, he put the package in 
his pocket and went on to dinner.

1190
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:21,120
That night at home, Marius opened the package 
and found that it contained four letters,  

1191
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:27,000
all addressed to different people, and 
smelling strongly of cheap tobacco.

1192
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:33,540
Marius read the four letters and discovered 
that they were all asking for money.

1193
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:40,020
However, there was something strange about 
them: although they all seemed to be written  

1194
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:45,660
by different people, they were written on 
the same rough paper in the same handwriting.

1195
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:50,580
He also noticed that each of them 
had similar spelling mistakes.

1196
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:55,080
Thinking no more about it, he 
wrapped the letters up again,  

1197
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,960
threw them into a corner and went to bed.

1198
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:04,320
The next morning, while he was working, 
there was a gentle knock on his door.

1199
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:10,980
'Come in,' Marius said, expecting 
it to be the concierge, Mme Bougon.

1200
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:17,880
But the voice that answered, saying, 'I beg your 
pardon, Monsieur,' was not that of Mme Bougon.

1201
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,640
It was more like the voice of a sick old man.

1202
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:29,640
Marius looked up quickly and saw that his visitor 
was a thin girl wearing just a skirt and shirt.

1203
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:36,780
She looked cold and ill, and when she spoke, 
Marius saw that she had lost several of her teeth.

1204
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:42,060
There was, however, still a trace of 
beauty in the sixteen-year-old lace,  

1205
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:46,380
like pale sunlight beneath the 
thick clouds of a winter's dawn.

1206
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:52,080
Marius rose to his feet, sure that he 
had seen the girl somewhere before.

1207
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:56,820
'What can I do for you, Mademoiselle?' he asked.

1208
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,180
'I've got a letter for you, M.

1209
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:02,280
Marius.'

1210
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,680
Marius opened the letter and read:

1211
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:13,260
My warm-hearted neighbour, I have heard of how 
you kindly paid my rent for me six months ago.

1212
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,060
I thank you for it.

1213
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:19,320
But my eldest daughter will tell you that my wife  

1214
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:23,520
is sick and none of us have 
had any food for four days.

1215
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:29,340
Please, Monsieur, show us the 
kindness of your generous heart again.

1216
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,700
My daughter is at your service.

1217
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:36,000
Yours truly, Jondrette.

1218
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:44,160
Marius realized at once that the handwriting, 
the yellow paper and the smell of cheap tobacco  

1219
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:48,180
was the same as in the four letters 
he had read the previous evening.

1220
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:53,280
He now had five letters, 
all the work of one author:  

1221
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:56,880
the man who lived with his 
family in the next room.

1222
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:01,560
The Jondrette family had been Marius's neighbours  

1223
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,460
for many months, but he had never 
before paid much attention to them.

1224
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,700
This was why he had failed to recognize the  

1225
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:11,160
two daughters when they had 
run into him on the street.

1226
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:17,640
But now he understood that Jondrette's 
business was writing dishonest letters,  

1227
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:21,480
asking for money from people he 
imagined were wealthier than himself.

1228
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:28,620
Marius looked up from the letter and watched 
the girl moving fearlessly around his room,  

1229
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:31,620
studying the furniture and the mirror on the wall.

1230
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:36,120
Her eyes lit up when she noticed 
the books on his writing desk.

1231
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:42,699
'Books!' she said, and then added with 
pride, 'I know how to read and write.

1232
01:34:42,699 --> 01:34:42,720
Look, I'll show you.'

1233
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:46,380
Picking up a pen that lay on the 
table, she wrote on a piece of paper,  

1234
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:55,560
Be careful! The police are coming! She showed 
Marius her work and then, changing the subject  

1235
01:34:55,560 --> 01:35:03,540
quickly, for no reason at all, she gazed into 
his eyes and said shyly, 'Do you know, M.

1236
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:07,020
Marius, that you're a very handsome boy?'

1237
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:16,020
Approaching him, she rested a cold red hand on 
his shoulder and said, 'You never notice me, M.

1238
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:18,180
Marius, but I know you.

1239
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:24,780
I see you on the stairs, and I see you walking 
around the streets, looking so sad and alone.'

1240
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,320
Marius's cheeks went red.

1241
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:31,380
He moved away from the girl's touch and said,  

1242
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:35,460
'I think, Mademoiselle, that I 
have something belonging to you.'

1243
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:38,820
He handed her the parcel of letters.

1244
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:43,920
She clapped her hands and cried, 'We've 
been looking for that everywhere!  

1245
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:48,540
How did you know they were mine? 
Of course, the handwriting.

1246
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,420
You were the man we ran into last night.'

1247
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:56,520
While she talked excitedly, she 
took out one of the letters.

1248
01:35:57,540 --> 01:36:01,260
'Ah, this is for the old man 
who goes to church every day.

1249
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,320
If I hurry, I might be able to catch him.

1250
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,720
Perhaps he'll give me enough for a dinner.

1251
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:09,080
We haven't eaten for three days...

1252
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:10,080
'

1253
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:14,820
Marius took a five-franc piece from 
his pocket and handed it to the girl.

1254
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,880
'The sun's come out at last!' she 
cried, eagerly accepting the coin.

1255
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,580
'That's enough food for two days.

1256
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:26,280
You're a real gentleman, Monsieur.'

1257
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:30,660
With those words, she gave 
a little laugh and wave,  

1258
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:35,160
grabbed some dry bread from the table 
and disappeared out of the door.

1259
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:37,860
***

1260
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:44,280
Marius had lived for five years without much 
money, but he had never been really poor.

1261
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:50,160
Now, after his conversation with the girl from the 
next room, he understood what real poverty was.

1262
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:56,160
Only a thin wall separated him from the 
family of lost souls in the room next door.

1263
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:03,660
He had heard them and seen them, but had paid 
them no attention, and he suddenly felt guilty.

1264
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:09,720
'If they had had another neighbour,' he 
thought, 'one who had noticed their suffering,  

1265
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:12,660
perhaps they could have been rescued by now.'

1266
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:18,300
As Marius was thinking about the sad 
life of the family in the next room,  

1267
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:21,360
he stared dreamily at the 
wall that separated them.

1268
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:28,500
Then, in the top corner near the ceiling, 
Marius saw that there was a triangular hole.

1269
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:33,900
'Let's see what these people are 
really like,' Marius thought.

1270
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:36,180
'Then I'll be in a better position to help them.'

1271
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:43,320
He stood on a cupboard, put his eye to the hole, 
and looked through it into his neighbours' room.

1272
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:52,020
The Jondrettes' room was dirty and evil-smelling, 
unlike Marius's bare but clean room.

1273
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:55,740
Its only furniture was a chair, an old table,  

1274
01:37:55,740 --> 01:38:01,020
some cracked dishes and two dirty 
beds, one on each side of a fireplace.

1275
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:08,160
A man with a long, grey beard was sitting at 
the table, writing a letter and smoking a pipe.

1276
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,440
A large woman with greying hair, 
once red, was sitting by the fire,  

1277
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:18,060
while a thin, pale-faced 
child sat on one of the beds.

1278
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:23,700
Marius, depressed at what he saw, was 
going to get down from the cupboard  

1279
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:28,560
when the door of the Jondrettes' room 
opened and the elder girl came in.

1280
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:34,680
Slamming the door shut behind her she 
cried victoriously, 'He's coming!'

1281
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:38,940
'Who's coming?' Her father looked up.

1282
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,220
'The old man who goes to church.

1283
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:42,540
He's following me.

1284
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:45,720
I saw him with his daughter in the 
church, and gave him the letter.

1285
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,780
He said he would follow me here.

1286
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:51,420
I ran ahead to tell you he'll 
be here in two minutes.'

1287
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:57,540
'You're a good girl,' the man 
said, rising quickly to his feet.

1288
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:05,040
Then, turning to his wife, he said, 'Quickly! 
Put out the fire!' While she poured water on  

1289
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:11,220
the flames, the man broke the chair with his foot 
and told his younger daughter to break a window.

1290
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:18,120
She put her fist through the glass and ran to her 
bed, crying because her arm was covered in blood.

1291
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:25,440
'Excellent,' her father smiled, tearing a 
piece off his shirt and using it as a bandage.

1292
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:28,860
'Now we're ready for the kind gentleman.

1293
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:33,600
When he sees how miserable we are, he'll 
give us a lot of money, you'll see.'

1294
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:38,580
Moments later, there was a 
gentle knock on the door.

1295
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:43,500
Jondrette rushed to open it, bowing 
almost to the ground as he did so.

1296
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:49,380
'Please come in, my dear sir! Please 
enter, with your charming young lady.'

1297
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:55,800
An elderly man and a young girl 
appeared in the doorway and Marius,  

1298
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:59,880
still looking through the hole in 
the wall, could not believe his eyes.

1299
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:02,280
It was She.

1300
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:09,180
She! Everyone who has ever loved will 
feel the force of that small word.

1301
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:15,360
In the bright mist that clouded his vision, 
Marius could hardly see the features of the sweet  

1302
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:21,720
face that had lit his life for six months and had 
then disappeared, filling his life with darkness.

1303
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:25,320
And now the vision had reappeared!

1304
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:32,220
When Marius had recovered some of his senses, he 
saw that she seemed a little paler than before.

1305
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,640
Her companion as usual was M.

1306
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:36,000
Leblanc.

1307
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:40,620
As she entered the room, she 
put a large parcel on the table.

1308
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:47,820
'Monsieur, you will find some woollen 
stockings and blankets in the parcel,' M.

1309
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:50,040
Leblanc told Jondrette.

1310
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:55,800
'You are extremely generous, Monsieur,' 
Jondrette said, again bowing to the ground.

1311
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:00,840
'But as you can see, we are 
unfortunate in many ways.

1312
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:04,380
We are without food, 
Monsieur, and without heating.

1313
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:07,200
No warmth for my unhappy children.

1314
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,660
Our only chair is broken.

1315
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:17,220
A broken window - in this weather! My wife 
ill in bed and our younger daughter injured.'

1316
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,820
'Oh, the poor child,' 'Ursula' said, 
seeing the girl's bleeding wrist.

1317
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:31,680
'She had an accident in the machine-shop where she 
works for six sous an hour, 'Jondrette explained.

1318
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:34,140
'They may have to cut off her arm.'

1319
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:40,440
The daughter, taking her father's words 
seriously, began to scream with fear.

1320
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:42,360
While M.

1321
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:44,940
Leblanc and 'Ursula' tried to comfort her,  

1322
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:50,580
Jondrette approached his wife and said in 
a whisper, 'Take a good look at that man.'

1323
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:53,820
He then returned to M.

1324
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:56,160
Leblanc and told him about his debts.

1325
01:41:56,700 --> 01:42:00,420
'I owe sixty francs in rent,' he said.

1326
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,100
M.

1327
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:05,100
Leblanc took a coin out of his 
pocket and put it on the table.

1328
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
'Five francs is all I have with me,' he said.

1329
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:14,820
'But I'll take my daughter home and come 
back this evening with more money for you.'

1330
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:18,180
Jondrette accompanied M.

1331
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:22,680
Leblanc and 'Ursula' out of the door 
and, after a few minutes' indecision,  

1332
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:27,000
Marius jumped down from the cupboard 
and ran out into the street.

1333
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:30,900
But he was too late; their 
carriage had already gone.

1334
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,080
Miserably, he turned back to the house.

1335
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:40,200
He went into his room, pushing the door 
behind him, but the door would not shut.

1336
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:44,580
Turning, Marius saw that a 
hand was holding it open.

1337
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,640
'What is it?' he demanded.

1338
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:50,160
It was the Jondrette girl.

1339
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:54,420
'So it's you again,' he said almost fiercely.

1340
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:55,800
'What do you want now?'

1341
01:42:57,180 --> 01:43:00,420
She did not reply but stood 
thoughtfully looking at him,  

1342
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:03,060
seeming to have lost all her earlier confidence.

1343
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:08,160
She had not entered the room, but was still 
standing in the half-light of the corridor.

1344
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,600
'What do you want?' Marius repeated angrily.

1345
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:14,760
'M.

1346
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:20,880
Marius,' she said at last, a faint 
light in her sad eyes, 'you seem upset.

1347
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,200
What's the matter?'

1348
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:23,580
'Nothing.

1349
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:25,620
Now please leave me alone.'

1350
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:30,420
Marius tried again to shut the 
door, but she still held it open.

1351
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:33,780
'You're making a mistake,' she said.

1352
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:37,500
'You aren't rich, but you 
were generous this morning.

1353
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:42,660
You've been kind to us - now 
I want to be kind to you.

1354
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:46,080
Is there anything that I can do?'

1355
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:51,480
Marius considered her offer, then had an idea.

1356
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,520
Moving closer to her, he said,  

1357
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:58,140
'Do you know the address of those 
people who've just left your room?'

1358
01:43:59,280 --> 01:43:59,760
'No.'

1359
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:02,280
'Can you find out for me?'

1360
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:08,460
'Is that what you want?' she said, 
a disappointed look on her face.

1361
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:09,660
'Yes.'

1362
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,140
The girl looked hard at him for a minute.

1363
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:17,520
'What will you give me?' she said at last.

1364
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:19,800
'Anything you want.'

1365
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:21,120
'Anything?'

1366
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:22,620
'Yes.'

1367
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:24,900
'Then I'll get it.'

1368
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:28,980
She left immediately, closing the door behind her.

1369
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:35,280
Marius sat down and buried his face in his 
hands, too overcome by emotion to think clearly.

1370
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:38,820
But then he heard a loud voice from the next room.

1371
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,460
'I tell you I'm sure.'

1372
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:44,340
Jondrette was speaking to his wife.

1373
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:45,960
'I recognized him.'

1374
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:50,160
Without another thought, Marius jumped on to  

1375
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,560
the cupboard and looked again 
through the hole in the wall.

1376
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:56,760
'Really?' His wife looked puzzled.

1377
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:57,900
'Are you sure?'

1378
01:44:57,900 --> 01:44:59,760
'Of course I'm sure.

1379
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:02,820
It's been eight years, but 
I recognized him at once.'

1380
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:07,140
He told the two girls to leave the room and then,  

1381
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:11,880
when alone with his wife, he said, 
'And I recognized the girl too.

1382
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,680
I'm surprised you didn't.'

1383
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:17,520
'Why should I? I've never seen her'

1384
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,840
But Jondrette bent down and 
whispered something in her ear.

1385
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:26,220
Straightening up, he said, 
'Now do you recognize her?'

1386
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:32,640
'Her?' said the woman, her 
voice filled with sudden hatred.

1387
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:35,940
'Are you sure? That's impossible!' she cried.

1388
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:38,880
'Our daughters barefoot and 
without a dress between them,  

1389
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,840
while she wears leather boots and 
a fur coat? You must be wrong.

1390
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:47,340
You've forgotten, that child was 
ugly, and this one's not bad-looking.'

1391
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:50,400
'I tell you, it's the same girl.

1392
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:51,660
You'll see.

1393
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:53,580
And I'll tell you another thing.

1394
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:55,980
She's going to make us a fortune.

1395
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:57,960
I'm tired of being poor.

1396
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:01,260
We deserve a better life, and this is our chance.'

1397
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:03,240
'What do you mean?'

1398
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:07,800
'He said he'll be here at six 
o'clock, with sixty francs.

1399
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:13,560
I'll bring some friends round, and we'll 
make sure he gives us a lot more money.'

1400
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:17,480
'What will you do if he 
doesn't give you more money?'

1401
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:21,120
Jondrette stroked his beard and laughed.

1402
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:24,000
'We'll know what to do about it.'

1403
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:28,740
And then, as he was going to leave the 
room, he turned to his wife and said,  

1404
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:32,280
'You know, it's lucky he didn't recognize me.

1405
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:35,940
If he had, he wouldn't be coming back here again.

1406
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:42,240
It's the beard that saved me - 
my lovely, long, romantic beard!'

1407
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:48,660
With an ugly laugh, he pulled his cap 
down over his eyes and left the room.

1408
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,240
***

1409
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:58,260
Although Marius was a dreamer and not a man of 
action, he knew immediately that he had to save M.

1410
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:02,040
Leblanc and 'Ursula' from the trap 
that Jondrette was setting for them.

1411
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:06,420
But what could he do? He could not warn M.

1412
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,520
Leblanc because he did not 
know the old man's address.

1413
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:13,440
There was only one thing to 
do: he had to tell the police.

1414
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:18,060
Half an hour later, Marius was 
at the nearest police station.

1415
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:24,000
The desk clerk showed him into the police 
chief's office, where a tall man with a  

1416
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,260
wide face and a thin, tight mouth was 
trying to keep warm next to a tire.

1417
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:33,060
'Are you the chief of police?' Marius asked.

1418
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:36,420
'He's away,' the tall man said.

1419
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,280
'I'm Inspector Javert.

1420
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:39,660
Now, what do you want?'

1421
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:44,400
Marius told Javert about the morning's events.

1422
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:50,760
When he told Javert his address, he noticed the 
inspector's eyes light up with great interest.

1423
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:55,740
Then, when everything had been 
explained, Javert thought for a moment.

1424
01:47:56,580 --> 01:48:01,320
Finally, he asked Marius for his 
door key and told him to go home  

1425
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:06,120
and hide quietly in his room so that 
his neighbours would think he was out.

1426
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:13,140
'Take these with you,' the inspector 
went on, producing two small guns.

1427
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:18,120
'When the old man and the girl 
arrive, let them start their business.

1428
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:22,800
When you think it's getting 
dangerous, shoot one of these guns.

1429
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,380
After that, I'll take charge.'

1430
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:31,380
Back in his room, Marius sat 
down nervously on his bed.

1431
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:33,300
It was nearly six o'clock.

1432
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:39,900
Outside it had stopped snowing, and a full moon 
was growing steadily brighter above the mist.

1433
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:42,300
Suddenly, he heard voices.

1434
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:48,960
Taking off his boots, he quietly climbed on to the 
cupboard and looked through the hole in the wall.

1435
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:54,000
A fire burned in the corner of the 
room, filling it with blood-red light.

1436
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:59,160
Jondrette, who had just come in, 
was shaking snow from his shoes.

1437
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:02,340
'Everything's arranged,' he said.

1438
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,200
'Has the concierge gone out?'

1439
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,540
'Yes,' his wife said.

1440
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:09,240
'And you're sure he's not in next door?'

1441
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:10,560
'Positive.'

1442
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,400
'Good.'

1443
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:14,100
Then he turned to his daughters.

1444
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:17,760
'Now, you two must go and 
keep guard in the street,  

1445
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,520
one by the gate, one at the street corner.'

1446
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:24,360
'A fine job!' the elder girl called back.

1447
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:26,700
'Keeping guard barefoot in the snow.'

1448
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:31,740
'Tomorrow you'll have fur boots!' 
her father called out after her.

1449
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:38,820
A few minutes later, there was nobody in the 
building except for Marius and the Jondrettes.

1450
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:46,020
Marius watched as Jondrette put a metal bar in 
the fire and inspected a rope ladder on the table.

1451
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:53,280
Next, he opened a drawer, took out a long 
knife and tested its blade with his finger.

1452
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:59,820
Suddenly, at exactly six o'clock, the 
door into the Jondrettes' room opened.

1453
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:04,500
'Welcome, Monsieur, 'Jondrette 
said, rising to his feet.

1454
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:06,600
M.

1455
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:10,020
Leblanc appeared and put four coins on the table.

1456
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:14,460
'That is for your rent and 
food, Monsieur,' he said.

1457
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:18,500
'Now we must discuss what else is needed.'

1458
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:23,400
Jondrette quietly told his 
wife to dismiss the carriage,  

1459
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,180
and when she had left the room, 
turned back to his visitor.

1460
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:31,260
'How is the wounded child?' M.

1461
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:32,100
Leblanc asked him.

1462
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:33,540
'Not well.'

1463
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,940
Jondrette smiled sadly.

1464
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:37,680
'She's in great pain.

1465
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:42,060
Her sister has taken her to 
hospital, but they'll be back soon.'

1466
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:47,100
The conversation continued politely 
in this way for several minutes.

1467
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:47,268
M.

1468
01:50:47,268 --> 01:50:51,060
Leblanc asked Jondrette about his circumstances,  

1469
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:55,980
and Jondrette smiled sadly 
as he invented lie after lie.

1470
01:50:56,820 --> 01:51:02,940
Finally, Jondrette picked up a large picture that 
was leaning against the wall, and showed it to M.

1471
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:03,300
Leblanc.

1472
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:05,760
'What's that?' M.

1473
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:10,380
Leblanc said, looking at the badly-drawn 
picture of a soldier in uniform.

1474
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:15,060
'It's a work of art,' Jondrette informed him.

1475
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:19,320
'I love this picture as much 
as I love my two daughters.

1476
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:22,980
But, unfortunately, I have to sell it.

1477
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:25,140
What do you think it's worth?'

1478
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:28,500
'It's just an old inn-sign.

1479
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:30,780
It's worth about three francs.'

1480
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:36,960
'I'll accept a thousand,' 
Jondrette softly replied.

1481
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:38,940
M.

1482
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:43,080
Leblanc rose and, standing with his back 
to the wall, looked quickly round the room.

1483
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:49,020
Jondrette was on his left, his wife was 
standing on his right near the door.

1484
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:54,660
Jondrette put the picture down and 
stepped quietly towards the old man.

1485
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:01,020
'You don't recognize me, do you?' 
he said in a loud, clear voice.

1486
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:05,700
At this signal, which he had 
pre-arranged with his friends,  

1487
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:09,660
three men armed with metal 
poles rushed into the room.

1488
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:11,160
M.

1489
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:15,540
Leblanc grew pale, and gripped the back 
of the broken chair with his huge hands.

1490
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:21,600
Marius, meanwhile, raised his right hand 
with the gun, ready to fire the warning shot.

1491
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:26,580
'The carriage is ready?' 
Jondrette asked the three men.

1492
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:30,420
'Yes, with two good horses,' one of them replied.

1493
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:31,560
'Excellent.'

1494
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:33,780
He turned to M.

1495
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:35,940
Leblanc and repeated his earlier question.

1496
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:39,600
'You still don't recognize me, do you?'

1497
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:41,160
'No.'

1498
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:44,340
'My name isn't Jondrette.

1499
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,620
It's Thenardier.

1500
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:49,020
Now do you recognize me?'

1501
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:51,120
M.

1502
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:54,060
Leblanc trembled slightly, 
but still shook his head.

1503
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:59,340
Marius, however, who had been going to fire 
the gun as a signal for the police to arrive,  

1504
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:02,480
shook so much that he almost 
fell off the cupboard.

1505
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:06,120
'Thenardier,' he thought.

1506
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:10,620
'That's the name of the man who saved my 
father's life at the Battle of Waterloo.

1507
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:12,420
The man I've promised to help!'

1508
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:16,800
If he fired the warning shot, M.

1509
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,220
Leblanc would be saved and 
Thenardier would be destroyed.

1510
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,880
But he would also have broken 
his promise to his father.

1511
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,820
He felt his knees grow weak.

1512
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:27,780
What should he do?

1513
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:32,580
Thenardier walked up and down in front of M.

1514
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:32,940
Leblanc.

1515
01:53:33,660 --> 01:53:38,100
'Do you remember the little inn 
in Montfermeil eight years ago?  

1516
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:44,640
You took away our Cosette, do you 
remember? Wearing that old yellow coat,  

1517
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:49,920
pretending you were a tramp! Well, now 
you're going to learn that you can't make  

1518
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:56,340
things right by just bringing a few hospital 
blankets! You're the cause of all my troubles.

1519
01:53:56,340 --> 01:54:01,920
For 1500 francs you took away a girl 
who was bringing me lots of money.'

1520
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:05,760
'I don't know what you're talking about,' M.

1521
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:06,540
Leblanc said.

1522
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:09,300
'I don't know who you are, 
but I know what you are.

1523
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:11,040
You're a dirty criminal.'

1524
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:16,440
'A criminal?' Thenardier said, suddenly angry.

1525
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:21,420
'That's what you rich people call people like me, 
isn't it? Just because I've failed in business.

1526
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:27,060
I was a war hero, you know - I saved 
an officer's life at Waterloo! And you  

1527
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:30,900
call me a criminal! Well, I'm 
going to teach you a lesson.'

1528
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:34,260
He began to move towards M.

1529
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:36,480
Leblanc, but the old man was too quick for him.

1530
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:41,940
With surprising speed, he pushed the table 
and chair to one side and ran to the window.

1531
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:45,420
He managed to open it but, before he could jump,  

1532
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:48,840
the three men jumped on him 
and held him to the floor.

1533
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:51,900
This was too much for Marius.

1534
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:56,820
'Forgive me, father,' he murmured, 
preparing to fire the gun.

1535
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:00,660
But suddenly Thenardier cried, 'Don't hurt him!'

1536
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:04,680
After a long fight, M.

1537
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:07,080
Leblanc was tied up and taken to the bed.

1538
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:12,420
'No wallet?' Thenardier cried, 
having searched his pockets.

1539
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:13,500
'Never mind.'

1540
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:21,540
He sat on the bed next to the helpless but brave 
old man, and said, 'Let's discuss things quietly.

1541
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:27,240
All I'm asking for is 200,000 francs.

1542
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:33,660
I realize that you don't have the money with 
you now, but I want you to write a letter.

1543
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:36,000
I'll tell you what to say.'

1544
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,880
He untied M.

1545
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:42,420
Leblanc's right hand and, 
producing a pen and paper, began:

1546
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:48,240
My dearest daughter, You must come at once.

1547
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:51,180
I need you urgently.

1548
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,420
The person who gives you this 
note will bring you to me.

1549
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,420
I shall be waiting.

1550
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:02,940
M.

1551
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:06,480
Leblanc signed his name Urbain Fabre,  

1552
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:10,920
which seemed to satisfy Thenardier, 
and wrote an address on the envelope.

1553
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:14,880
Thenardier then took the 
letter and gave it to his wife.

1554
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,220
'There's a carriage outside.

1555
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:18,660
Don't be long.'

1556
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,260
Nearly half an hour passed.

1557
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:26,280
Thenardier seemed lost in his own dark thoughts.

1558
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:28,080
The prisoner did not move.

1559
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:33,540
Finally, there was the sound of 
horses in the street outside and,  

1560
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:36,420
moments later, the door to 
the room was thrown open.

1561
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:41,460
'It's a false address,' Mme Thenardier cried.

1562
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:43,560
'There's no Urbain Fabre.

1563
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:45,660
The old man's been lying to us!'

1564
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:51,360
Thenardier sat on the corner of the 
table in silence for some moments,  

1565
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:55,560
swinging his leg and gazing with 
a fierce satisfaction at the fire.

1566
01:56:56,340 --> 01:57:00,420
Then he turned to the prisoner and 
said in a slow, threatening voice,  

1567
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:06,960
'What did you hope to gain by 
giving me a false name and address?'

1568
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:13,140
'Time!' cried the prisoner in a 
loud voice, jumping from the bed,  

1569
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:16,380
having secretly cut the ropes that tied him.

1570
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,860
Before the others in the room could react, M.

1571
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:24,120
Leblanc was standing by the fire, 
holding a metal bar above his head.

1572
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:27,120
'I'm not afraid of you,' he said.

1573
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:29,520
'But neither should you fear me.'

1574
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:35,400
With those words he threw the metal bar 
out of the window into the street below.

1575
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:38,220
'Get him!' Thenardier shouted.

1576
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:39,240
'He's defenceless.'

1577
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:42,480
Two men grabbed him by the shoulders.

1578
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:46,080
'Now cut his throat!' Thenardier called.

1579
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:50,820
Marius stared, frozen with fear as Thenardier,  

1580
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:55,140
knife in hand, stood hesitating a 
few steps away from the prisoner.

1581
01:57:56,280 --> 01:58:01,440
The brave man was in terrible danger, 
but Marius still could not fire the gun.

1582
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:06,180
Then, in the moonlight, he saw 
the solution to his problem.

1583
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:11,760
On top of the cupboard, by his feet, 
he noticed the piece of paper that  

1584
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:16,200
the elder daughter had written on: 
Be careful! The police are coming!

1585
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:19,440
He immediately saw what he had to do.

1586
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:24,180
He took a piece of brick from the 
wall, wrapped the piece of paper  

1587
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:28,740
around it and threw it through the hole 
into the middle of Thenardier's room.

1588
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:31,260
He was just in time.

1589
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:34,800
Thenardier was advancing towards his prisoner,  

1590
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:38,220
knife in hand, when his wife 
cried, 'Something fell!'

1591
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:44,760
She picked up the piece of paper and handed 
it to her husband, who read it quickly.

1592
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:50,220
'It's Eponine's handwriting!' 
he cried a moment later.

1593
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:52,260
'Quick! Get the ladder.

1594
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:54,300
The police are coming and we've got to go!'

1595
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:59,100
They threw the rope ladder from the open 
window but, before they could escape,  

1596
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:03,300
the door opened and Inspector Javert walked in.

1597
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:06,300
'Relax,' he smiled.

1598
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:08,520
'You can't escape through the window.

1599
01:59:09,180 --> 01:59:11,820
There are five of you, and fifteen of us.

1600
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:13,440
You have no chance.

1601
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:15,960
Why not come quietly?'

1602
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:21,000
The men put down their weapons 
and surrendered without a fight.

1603
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:27,120
When everybody had been arrested and taken 
from the room, Javert noticed the prisoner,  

1604
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:29,760
who was standing, head bowed, by the window.

1605
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:37,800
He turned to speak to another policeman but, when 
he looked back, he saw that the prisoner had gone.

1606
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:41,280
Javert rushed to the open window and looked down.

1607
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:46,500
The rope ladder was swinging 
gently above the empty street.

1608
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:53,760
'He must have been the cleverest of them 
all, 'Javert murmured angrily to himself.

1609
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:55,680
CHAPTER EIGHT

1610
01:59:56,220 --> 01:59:58,200
Marius and Cosette

1611
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:03,480
Not wishing to give evidence against Thenardier  

1612
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:07,500
in court, Marius made immediate 
arrangements to leave his room.

1613
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:09,900
Early the following morning,  

1614
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:15,340
he paid the concierge his final rent and 
went to live with his friend, Enjolras.

1615
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:21,240
Inspector Javert looked for Marius 
everywhere, but without success.

1616
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:26,460
Two months later, Marius was deeply unhappy.

1617
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,820
He sent money every Monday to Thenardier,  

1618
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:34,440
who was in prison, which meant that 
he had even less money for himself.

1619
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:38,880
But the main reason for his unhappiness was that  

1620
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:42,660
he was forced to live his life 
with no hope of seeing 'Ursula'.

1621
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:48,060
One afternoon he was sitting in a 
field, looking down at a small river,  

1622
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:53,760
when his dreams of 'Ursula' were suddenly 
broken by the sound of a familiar voice.

1623
02:00:54,900 --> 02:01:00,300
He looked up and recognized 
Eponine, Thenardiers elder daughter.

1624
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:05,520
Still wearing the same rags, with 
the same bold look in her eyes and  

1625
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:09,480
the same rough voice, she had 
somehow become more beautiful.

1626
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:14,220
She stared at Marius with a look 
of pleasure on her pale face,  

1627
02:01:14,220 --> 02:01:16,980
and for some moments seemed unable to speak.

1628
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:23,280
'So at last I've found you,' she finally said.

1629
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:25,740
'I've been looking for you everywhere.

1630
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,920
You aren't living in the same room any more?'

1631
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:32,040
'No,' said Marius.

1632
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:35,400
'Well, I can understand that.

1633
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:37,140
It's not nice, that sort of thing.

1634
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:40,740
But why are you wearing that dirty old hat?  

1635
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:47,220
'When Marius gave no answer, she went 
on, 'And you've got a hole in your shirt.

1636
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:49,740
I'll mend it for you.

1637
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:53,040
A young man like you ought to be nicely dressed.'

1638
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:58,260
Marius still said nothing, and 
after a moments pause she said,  

1639
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:05,340
'You don't seem very glad to see me, but I 
could make you look happy if I wanted to!'

1640
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:08,340
'How?' said Marius.

1641
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:09,120
'What do you mean?'

1642
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:12,840
'You weren't so unfriendly last time.'

1643
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:16,200
'I'm sorry, but what do you mean?'

1644
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:21,540
She bit her lip and hesitated, as if 
trying to make up her mind about something.

1645
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:25,680
Finally, she said, 'I've got the address.'

1646
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:29,520
Marius's heart seemed to miss a beat.

1647
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:31,200
'You mean

1648
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:33,900
'The address you wanted me to find out.

1649
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:36,360
The young lady, you know...'

1650
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:39,240
Her voice sank into a sigh.

1651
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:42,120
Marius jumped up and took her by the hand.

1652
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:45,720
'Let's go at once!' he 
cried, wild with excitement.

1653
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:50,460
Then he suddenly frowned and 
seized Eponine by the arm.

1654
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:55,500
'But you must promise me,' he said, 'that 
you'll never tell your father the address.'

1655
02:02:56,940 --> 02:03:01,680
'I promise,' the girl replied, 
staring at Marius with amusement.

1656
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:06,000
They had only gone a few steps 
when Eponine stopped and said,  

1657
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:08,700
'You remember you promised me something?'

1658
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:11,820
Marius felt in his pocket.

1659
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:16,620
All he had in the world was the five-franc 
piece he intended to give her father in prison.

1660
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:22,920
He pushed it into her hand, but she opened her 
fingers and let the coin fall to the ground.

1661
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:28,020
She looked at him with a mixture of 
disappointment and sadness in her eyes.

1662
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:32,640
'I don't want your money,' she said.

1663
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:34,680
***

1664
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:40,740
That evening, Cosette was alone in the house which 
Jean Valjean had bought about a year earlier.

1665
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:45,780
It was a small house in a back 
street, with a large, wild garden.

1666
02:03:45,780 --> 02:03:49,860
Valjean had gone away on 
business for a couple of days,  

1667
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:53,640
and Cosette was in the downstairs 
sitting room, playing the piano.

1668
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:58,740
Suddenly, she thought she heard the 
sound of footsteps in the garden.

1669
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:03,840
She listened at the window for a 
minute, then ran up to her bedroom,  

1670
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:06,660
opened the window and looked out.

1671
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:12,120
The moonlit garden and the street 
beyond it were completely empty.

1672
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:19,140
Cosette, not a nervous girl by nature, smiled 
to herself and thought no more about it.

1673
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:23,700
The next evening, as she 
was walking in the garden,  

1674
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:27,360
she was sure that she heard 
someone moving in the trees.

1675
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:31,200
Again, when she looked round, she saw nothing.

1676
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:36,180
When Jean Valjean returned from 
his business the following day,  

1677
02:04:36,900 --> 02:04:39,780
Cosette told him about the noises in the garden.

1678
02:04:40,740 --> 02:04:45,840
He told her not to worry, but she 
noticed an anxious look in his eyes.

1679
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:52,860
He spent the next two nights walking around the 
garden, checking the gate, listening for noises,  

1680
02:04:53,580 --> 02:04:55,560
but nothing unusual happened.

1681
02:04:57,180 --> 02:05:04,260
Then one morning, a few days later, Cosette 
noticed a large stone lying on the garden bench.

1682
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:10,560
Nervously, she picked it up and 
discovered an envelope underneath it.

1683
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:16,860
Inside, there was a small 
notebook filled with love poems.

1684
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,980
Cosette sat down and began to read,  

1685
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:24,360
enjoying the music of the language 
and the beauty of the handwriting.

1686
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:30,420
She had never read anything like this 
before, and it affected her deeply.

1687
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:37,920
Her heart on fire, she took the notebook upstairs 
to her bedroom and read every word again.

1688
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:43,860
She remembered the handsome young man she 
had seen so often in the Luxembourg Gardens.

1689
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:49,980
As she read the notebook, she 
knew in her heart that he was  

1690
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:52,680
the author of these beautiful, romantic words.

1691
02:05:53,940 --> 02:06:00,000
Finally, she kissed the book, held it 
to her heart and waited for the evening,  

1692
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,840
when she knew that something 
special was going to occur.

1693
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:08,100
That evening, Jean Valjean went out.

1694
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:12,420
Cosette spent a long time in front of the mirror,  

1695
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:16,560
making her hair look beautiful 
and deciding which dress to wear.

1696
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:20,040
Finally, she went out into the garden.

1697
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:23,760
She sat on the bench where 
she had found the notebook  

1698
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:29,640
and, moments later, had the strange 
feeling that she was being watched.

1699
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:33,960
She looked round and jumped to her feet.

1700
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:36,000
It was He!

1701
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:40,140
He looked paler and thinner than she remembered.

1702
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:43,440
His dark clothes were almost 
invisible in the shadows,  

1703
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:46,320
and his face shone softly in the fading light.

1704
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:52,560
Cosette felt suddenly faint, but 
she did not move or make a sound.

1705
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:56,760
'Forgive me for being here.'

1706
02:06:57,660 --> 02:06:59,280
Marius spoke at last.

1707
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:01,800
'But I've been so unhappy.

1708
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:05,460
Do you recognize me? You mustn't be afraid.

1709
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:13,620
It's a long time ago, but do you remember the day 
when you first looked at me - in the Luxembourg  

1710
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:20,400
Gardens? And the day you walked past me? 
Those things happened nearly a year ago.

1711
02:07:21,420 --> 02:07:28,800
Forgive me for talking like this, I don't know 
what I'm saying - perhaps I'm annoying you?  

1712
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:33,540
But the truth is, I can't live without you.'

1713
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:40,320
'Mother!' Cosette murmured, and began to fall.

1714
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:44,160
Marius caught her and held her tightly in his arms  

1715
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:47,520
without realizing what he was 
doing, lost in a mist of love.

1716
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:55,080
Cosette, feeling her body close to his, took 
his hand and pressed it against her heart.

1717
02:07:56,520 --> 02:08:03,060
Aware of the shape of the notebook under her 
dress, he said, 'So, you've read my notebook.

1718
02:08:04,260 --> 02:08:05,760
Do you love me, too?'

1719
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:10,020
'Of course,' she answered in a low voice.

1720
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:11,880
'You know I do.'

1721
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:18,900
Then, as if by magic, her lips were 
next to his and they were kissing.

1722
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:26,400
Afterwards, they sat together on the garden bench 
in a state of shock, neither of them speaking.

1723
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:32,580
Beneath the stars, they were happy just to look 
into each others eyes and hold each other's hands.

1724
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:36,000
Then, at last, they began to speak.

1725
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:40,200
They talked all evening about 
their dreams, their mistakes,  

1726
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:43,140
their moments of happiness, 
their moments of despair.

1727
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:51,720
When everything had been said, she laid her head 
on his shoulder and asked, 'What's your name?'

1728
02:08:53,100 --> 02:08:54,420
'My name's Marius.

1729
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:56,400
And yours?'

1730
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:58,320
'Cosette.'

1731
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:06,540
During that month of May in the 
year 1832, Cosette and Marius met  

1732
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:10,140
every day in the wild garden 
of that small, secret house.

1733
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:16,560
They would sit and hold hands and talk, or 
just gaze into each other's eyes and smile.

1734
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:21,720
'How lovely you are,' Marius would sigh.

1735
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:25,320
'There are moments when I think this is a dream.

1736
02:09:26,460 --> 02:09:29,820
There are other moments when 
I think I'm a little mad.

1737
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:31,380
I love you so much.'

1738
02:09:32,820 --> 02:09:38,760
To which Cosette would reply, 'I love 
you more with every minute that passes.'

1739
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:45,300
In this way, bathed in happiness, 
they lived untroubled by the world.

1740
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:47,760
***

1741
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:54,240
One beautiful, starry evening, Marius found 
Cosette sitting unhappily in her garden.

1742
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:58,920
'What's the matter?' he asked, 
sitting next to her on the bench.

1743
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:03,840
'My father said that we may 
have to leave,' she replied.

1744
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:06,360
Marius trembled.

1745
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:10,800
For six weeks, he had known nothing 
but uncomplicated happiness.

1746
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:16,140
Now, for the first time, there was a 
cloud in the clear blue sky of his life.

1747
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:21,420
He could not speak, and Cosette 
felt his hand grow cold.

1748
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:25,860
She asked, as he had done, 'What's the matter?'

1749
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:30,480
He replied, in a voice so low 
that she could hardly hear it,  

1750
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:34,620
'I don't understand what you mean.'

1751
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:39,900
'Father told me this morning 
that I have to pack everything  

1752
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:42,540
and be ready to leave for England within a week.'

1753
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:51,300
Marius rose to his feet and said 
coldly, 'Cosette, are you going?'

1754
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:56,520
She looked up at him, her 
pale face lined with misery.

1755
02:10:57,300 --> 02:11:00,000
'What else can I do?' she cried.

1756
02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:02,760
'So you're leaving me.'

1757
02:11:03,660 --> 02:11:07,560
'Oh, Marius, why are you being so cruel to me?'

1758
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:13,860
Marius turned his back to her and 
said, 'Then I shall have to go away.'

1759
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:16,260
'No, Marius, wait.

1760
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:18,240
I've got an idea.'

1761
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:22,680
Marius turned and was 
surprised to see her smiling.

1762
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:24,660
'What is it?'

1763
02:11:25,860 --> 02:11:28,680
'If we go, you must come too.

1764
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:33,360
I'll tell you where, and you must 
meet me there, wherever it is.'

1765
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:37,260
'How can I possibly do that?' he cried.

1766
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:41,760
'Are you crazy? You need money to go 
to England, and I haven't got any.

1767
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:45,660
I haven't told you, Cosette, but I'm a poor man.

1768
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:51,300
I wear a cheap hat, my jacket has lost half 
its buttons and there are holes in my boots.'

1769
02:11:52,620 --> 02:11:56,100
He turned away from her and 
stood with his face pressed  

1770
02:11:56,100 --> 02:11:58,680
to the trunk of a tree, almost ready to faint.

1771
02:11:59,700 --> 02:12:01,920
He stayed in that position for some time.

1772
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:10,140
Finally, he heard a small sound behind him and, 
turning round, he saw that Cosette was in tears.

1773
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:14,880
He fell on his knees in front of her 
and pressed her hand to his lips.

1774
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:17,640
'Don't cry,' he said.

1775
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:20,040
'I cannot let you leave me.

1776
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:24,780
I promise you that if you leave me, I shall die.

1777
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:28,320
But listen to me - I have a plan.

1778
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:31,140
Don't expect me here tomorrow.'

1779
02:12:32,160 --> 02:12:35,640
'Why not?' Cosette said, drying her tears.

1780
02:12:35,640 --> 02:12:39,060
'A whole day without seeing 
you! That's unbearable!'

1781
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:44,640
'It's worth losing a day together if we 
want to be happy for the rest of our lives.'

1782
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:47,040
'But what are you going to do?'

1783
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:50,580
'Wait until the day after tomorrow.

1784
02:12:50,580 --> 02:12:52,260
I'll tell you then.

1785
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:56,340
But until then, I must give you my address.

1786
02:12:57,060 --> 02:12:59,880
I'm living with a friend of mine, Enjolras.'

1787
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:04,440
Marius then took a knife out 
of his pocket and scratched  

1788
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:09,300
his address on the wall - 16, rue de la Verrerie.'

1789
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:13,200
'Please, Marius,' Cosette said as she watched him.

1790
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:19,140
'Where are you going tomorrow evening? I 
won't be able to sleep if you don't tell me.'

1791
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:21,480
'I'm going to try something.'

1792
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:27,240
'Well, I'll pray for you to succeed 
and I'll never stop thinking about you.

1793
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:33,000
I'll ask no more questions, but you must 
promise to be here early the day after tomorrow.

1794
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,920
Not later than nine o'clock.'

1795
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,520
'I promise,' Marius said.

1796
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:41,460
CHAPTER NINE

1797
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:43,860
Monsieur Gillenormand

1798
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:44,100
M.

1799
02:13:44,660 --> 02:13:50,880
Gillenormand, Marius's grandfather, 
was now ninety years old.

1800
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:59,340
He was unhappy about many things - about losing 
his teeth, about the political situation but, most  

1801
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:05,400
of all, about the fact that he had not seen his 
grandson for four years, since their big quarrel.

1802
02:14:06,060 --> 02:14:12,180
Although he was too proud to admit he 
was wrong, and although he was angry, M.

1803
02:14:12,180 --> 02:14:16,440
Gillenormand hoped that Marius, whom 
he still loved, would return one day.

1804
02:14:17,940 --> 02:14:19,860
One evening in June, M.

1805
02:14:19,860 --> 02:14:22,440
Gillenormand was sitting in front of a large fire,  

1806
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:26,340
staring into the flames and 
thinking bitterly of Marius.

1807
02:14:27,060 --> 02:14:32,880
He was feeling depressed, because he realized that 
he would probably never see his grandson again.

1808
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:37,860
While he was gazing into the 
fire, thinking these sad thoughts,  

1809
02:14:37,860 --> 02:14:44,820
his old servant entered the room 
and asked, 'Will Monsieur receive M.

1810
02:14:44,820 --> 02:14:45,180
Marius?'

1811
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:50,460
For a moment all the blood seemed to leave M.

1812
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:54,780
Gillenormand's face, and the servant 
began to worry that his master was ill.

1813
02:14:55,800 --> 02:15:02,520
But the old man finally raised his head 
and said, in a low voice, 'Show him in.'

1814
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:06,900
Marius stood uncertainly in the doorway.

1815
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:12,120
The poor condition of his clothes could not 
be seen in the half-darkness of the room.

1816
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:15,900
Nothing of him was clearly 
visible except his face,  

1817
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:19,680
which was calm and serious, but strangely sad.

1818
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:21,780
M.

1819
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:24,660
Gillenormand stared at his 
grandson with disbelief.

1820
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:34,080
At last! After four years! Was it really 
him? He wanted to open his arms and hug him,  

1821
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:38,340
but all he said was, 'What have you come for?'

1822
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:42,420
Marius murmured something in embarrassment.

1823
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:47,340
'I can't hear you,' the old 
man said, looking annoyed.

1824
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:54,240
'Have you come to apologize? Do 
you now see that you were wrong?'

1825
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:56,700
'No, Monsieur.'

1826
02:15:57,600 --> 02:15:59,640
Marius lowered his eyes.

1827
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:03,240
'Well then,' the old man 
shouted, 'what do you want?'

1828
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:08,340
'Monsieur, I ask you to have pity on me.

1829
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:14,220
I know I'm not welcome here, but I 
have come to ask for only one thing.

1830
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:16,500
Then I'll go away at once.'

1831
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:20,880
'You're a young fool,' the old man said.

1832
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:23,460
'Who said you had to go away?  

1833
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:32,701
You left me - your grandfather! - to join in those 
street protests against the government, I suppose.

1834
02:16:33,540 --> 02:16:40,979
You're probably in trouble with the police, or 
you're in debt, and you've run back to me for help

1835
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:43,800
'Monsieur, it's none of those things.'

1836
02:16:44,820 --> 02:16:47,939
'Well, what is it exactly that you want?'

1837
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:52,500
'I have come to ask your 
permission to get married.'

1838
02:16:54,060 --> 02:16:56,880
The old man paused for a moment before saying,  

1839
02:16:57,660 --> 02:17:02,160
'So, you want to get married 
at the age of twenty-one.

1840
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:09,300
I suppose you've got some sort of career, 
now? Perhaps you've made a fortune.

1841
02:17:10,380 --> 02:17:12,840
What do you earn as a lawyer?'

1842
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:14,640
'Nothing.'

1843
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:19,500
'Well then, I imagine the 
lucky girl must have money.'

1844
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:22,500
'She's no richer than I am.'

1845
02:17:23,220 --> 02:17:25,200
'What does her father do?'

1846
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:26,760
'I don't know.'

1847
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:28,275
M.

1848
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:30,780
Gillenormand turned away with disgust.

1849
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:32,580
'So that's it.

1850
02:17:33,300 --> 02:17:37,500
Twenty-one years old, no job, no money.

1851
02:17:38,340 --> 02:17:43,260
Your wife will have to count the sous 
when she goes to the market, won't she?'

1852
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:47,460
'I beg you, Monsieur,' Marius cried.

1853
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:48,960
'I love her so much.

1854
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:51,300
Please allow me to marry her!'

1855
02:17:52,380 --> 02:17:55,500
The old man gave a high, unpleasant laugh.

1856
02:17:55,500 --> 02:18:02,700
'So you said to yourself, "I'll have 
to go and see him, that old fool.

1857
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:07,260
He'll be so happy to see me 
that he won't care who I marry.

1858
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:13,140
I haven't a pair of shoes, and she 
hasn't a shirt, but never mind.

1859
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:17,520
I'm going to throw away my youth, my career,  

1860
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:23,220
my whole life, and dive into poverty 
with a woman around my neck...

1861
02:18:23,220 --> 02:18:25,620
" That's what you think, isn't it?

1862
02:18:26,220 --> 02:18:30,360
Well, my boy, you can do whatever you want.

1863
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:34,800
But I will never give you my permission! Never!'

1864
02:18:35,939 --> 02:18:37,019
'Grandfather

1865
02:18:37,020 --> 02:18:37,440
'Never!'

1866
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:43,321
The tone of his grandfather's 
voice robbed Marius of all hope.

1867
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:47,340
He rose and crossed the room 
slowly, with his head bowed.

1868
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:52,080
He had just reached the door, however, when M.

1869
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:53,760
Gillenormand moved quickly towards him,  

1870
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:57,480
pulled him back into the room 
and pushed him into an armchair.

1871
02:18:58,380 --> 02:19:06,060
'Tell me about it,' he said to Marius, who 
stared back with silent amazement, unaware  

1872
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:11,400
that the word 'grandfather' was responsible 
for the change in the old man's behaviour.

1873
02:19:12,180 --> 02:19:16,080
'Come on, tell me about your love affairs.

1874
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:18,480
Don't be afraid to talk.

1875
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:21,600
Don't forget, I'm your grandfather.

1876
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:23,220
Here...

1877
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:27,241
' he said, taking a purse from a 
drawer and putting it on the table.

1878
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:29,519
'Here's some money for you.

1879
02:19:30,060 --> 02:19:32,220
Buy yourself some new clothes.'

1880
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:38,520
Marius told his grandfather all about 
Cosette and how much he loved her.

1881
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:40,080
M.

1882
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:44,700
Gillenormand listened carefully and, 
when Marius had finished, he laughed.

1883
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:50,040
'You must enjoy yourself 
when you're young,' he said.

1884
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:52,859
'But you must also be sensible.

1885
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:58,439
Don't get married yet, that's my advice.

1886
02:19:58,439 --> 02:20:02,879
Have fun with the girl, but don't marry her.

1887
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:07,080
Make her your lover but not your wife.'

1888
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:13,741
Marius, too shocked to reply, shook 
his head and rose to his feet.

1889
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:23,161
He then turned slowly to the old man, bowed deeply 
and said, 'Four years ago you insulted my father.

1890
02:20:24,180 --> 02:20:27,480
Today you have insulted my future wife.

1891
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:31,321
I shall ask no more favours of you, Monsieur.

1892
02:20:32,220 --> 02:20:32,940
Goodbye.'

1893
02:20:35,640 --> 02:20:35,821
M.

1894
02:20:35,820 --> 02:20:39,299
Gillenormand called for Marius to 
come back, but it was too late.

1895
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:43,080
The proud young man had closed the door and gone.

1896
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:49,920
'Oh my God,' the old man cried, 
burying his face in his hands.

1897
02:20:50,460 --> 02:20:54,720
'What have I done? This 
time he'll never come back.'

1898
02:20:55,640 --> 02:20:56,640
***

1899
02:20:56,640 --> 02:21:00,060
Marius left his grandfathers 
house in a state of despair,  

1900
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:04,621
and returning to his room, fell 
asleep fully-dressed on the bed.

1901
02:21:06,060 --> 02:21:10,201
When he woke up, Enjolras was in 
the room with a few other friends.

1902
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:14,281
They all looked very nervous 
and excited about something.

1903
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:19,020
'What's the matter?' Marius asked sleepily

1904
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:23,460
'Are you coming to the 
funeral of General Lamarque?'

1905
02:21:24,660 --> 02:21:25,740
'Who's he?'

1906
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:30,000
Enjolras and his friends shook their heads with  

1907
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:34,080
amazement at their friend's lack of 
awareness, and soon left the room.

1908
02:21:35,700 --> 02:21:41,939
Marius opened a drawer and took out the two guns 
which Inspector Javert had lent him in February.

1909
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:48,479
Putting them in his jacket pocket, he went out and 
continued to wander aimlessly around the streets,  

1910
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:54,840
noticing only occasionally the strange atmosphere 
of excitement that was growing in the town.

1911
02:21:55,680 --> 02:22:01,380
People were running around, and there was a 
lot of noise, but Marius paid little attention.

1912
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:07,080
He could think of only one thing: his 
meeting later that evening with Cosette.

1913
02:22:07,979 --> 02:22:14,580
This would be his last brief happiness; 
after that, there would be only darkness.

1914
02:22:14,580 --> 02:22:21,000
At nine o'clock that evening, Marius 
crept into the garden of Cosette's house,  

1915
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:25,020
but she was not there waiting 
for him as she had promised.

1916
02:22:25,859 --> 02:22:31,500
Looking up, he saw that there were no lights on 
in the house and that all the windows were closed.

1917
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:36,660
Unable to control himself, he beat his 
fists against the walls of the house.

1918
02:22:37,319 --> 02:22:40,439
'Cosette!' he cried, not caring who heard him.

1919
02:22:40,439 --> 02:22:41,519
'Where are you?'

1920
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:49,140
He called her name again and again until, 
exhausted, he sat down on the stone steps.

1921
02:22:50,220 --> 02:22:54,480
Now she was gone, he told 
himself, he had no future.

1922
02:22:55,319 --> 02:22:58,259
There was nothing for him to do except die.

1923
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:04,440
Suddenly he heard a voice calling 
through the trees from the street.

1924
02:23:05,060 --> 02:23:06,060
'M.

1925
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:07,081
Marius!'

1926
02:23:08,220 --> 02:23:09,000
He looked up.

1927
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:10,439
'Who's that?'

1928
02:23:11,939 --> 02:23:13,799
'Is that you, M.

1929
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:14,220
Marius?'

1930
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:15,540
'Yes.'

1931
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:21,660
'Your friends are waiting for you at 
the barricade in the rue de Chanvrerie.'

1932
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:28,380
Marius ran to the gate and was just 
in time to see the figure of Eponine,  

1933
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:33,600
Thenardier's daughter, disappearing into 
the shadows at the end of the street.

1934
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:38,640
CHAPTER TEN

1935
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:39,600
The Barricade

1936
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:46,920
In the spring of 1832, the people 
of Paris were ready for revolution.

1937
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:55,260
Charles X, who had become king in 1824, believed 
that he had total power over the French people.

1938
02:23:56,100 --> 02:24:00,360
He was a strong supporter of the 
Catholic church and the aristocracy,  

1939
02:24:00,359 --> 02:24:05,280
and he took away the freedoms that 
Napoleon had given the ordinary citizens.

1940
02:24:06,420 --> 02:24:11,520
Although this made him very unpopular, 
he thought that his opponents would be  

1941
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:14,281
too weak to prevent him from doing what he wanted.

1942
02:24:15,180 --> 02:24:16,140
He was wrong.

1943
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:22,319
In 1830, there was a peaceful 
revolution, and he was forced to leave.

1944
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:29,100
The new king, Louis-Philippe, was a brave 
and clever man who loved his country.

1945
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:34,740
The ordinary people liked him at 
first, but he soon showed that he  

1946
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:39,059
was more interested in power for his 
family than democracy for his people.

1947
02:24:40,439 --> 02:24:45,419
He understood business, but he could not 
understand the problems of poor people.

1948
02:24:46,140 --> 02:24:50,340
Neither could he understand the 
concept of freedom of speech,  

1949
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:56,819
and he often sent soldiers into the streets to 
attack people who were making public protests.

1950
02:24:58,380 --> 02:25:04,800
As the summer approached, the mood of the 
workers and the poor became angrier and angrier.

1951
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:12,599
Their anger exploded into violence in 
June 1832, when General Lamarque died.

1952
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:19,380
The General had been very popular with the people 
of France because of his love for Napoleon.

1953
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:26,700
The day of his funeral was arranged for 
5 June, and thousands of people saw this  

1954
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:31,380
as a chance to make a public protest 
against the king and his government.

1955
02:25:32,700 --> 02:25:35,399
At first, the funeral went quietly.

1956
02:25:35,939 --> 02:25:40,019
Soldiers accompanied the coffin as 
it was carried slowly across Paris.

1957
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:46,740
A large crowd followed behind, waving 
flags and carrying swords and heavy sticks.

1958
02:25:47,700 --> 02:25:50,160
The crowd grew more and more excited,  

1959
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:56,340
until finally they tried to take the coffin away 
from the soldiers and carry it across a bridge.

1960
02:25:57,180 --> 02:26:00,840
Their exit was blocked by 
more soldiers on horseback.

1961
02:26:01,859 --> 02:26:03,660
For a moment, nothing happened.

1962
02:26:04,380 --> 02:26:06,780
Then there were two gunshots.

1963
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:12,300
The first shot killed the commander of the 
soldiers guarding the exit to the bridge.

1964
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:17,460
The second killed a deaf old woman 
who was trying to shut her window.

1965
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:20,580
Then the fighting started.

1966
02:26:21,660 --> 02:26:27,960
Soldiers attacked the crowd with swords; the crowd 
threw stones and ran screaming across the bridge.

1967
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:34,319
Minutes later, the sounds of war 
echoed across the whole city of Paris.

1968
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:36,840
***

1969
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:42,300
As soon as the fighting started, Enjolras 
and several of his friends started to  

1970
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:47,820
build a barricade outside the Corinth 
wine shop in the rue de la Chanvrerie,  

1971
02:26:47,819 --> 02:26:53,519
a small street surrounded by dark 
alleys in the market district of Paris.

1972
02:26:54,840 --> 02:27:00,780
Enjolras had been joined by many strangers as he 
and his friends had run shouting along the street.

1973
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:06,840
There was a tall, grey-haired man 
whom nobody knew, but whose strong,  

1974
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:08,880
brave face had impressed everybody.

1975
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:14,880
There were several street children, excited 
by the sound of battle, who also joined them.

1976
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:18,480
One of these children was Eponine,  

1977
02:27:18,479 --> 02:27:22,679
who had dressed like a boy so that 
no one would tell her to go home.

1978
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:27,480
Having run to tell Marius that 
his friends were waiting for him,  

1979
02:27:27,479 --> 02:27:31,919
she was helping Enjolras and his 
companions to build the barricade.

1980
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:37,260
New people arrived all the time, 
bringing with them gunpowder and  

1981
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:40,580
weapons to fight the soldiers 
who would be arriving very soon.

1982
02:27:40,580 --> 02:27:44,519
Enjolras, who was the leader of the rebels,  

1983
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:50,400
organized the building of a second barricade and 
the manufacture of bullets from melted silver.

1984
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:55,980
The tall, grey-haired man was doing 
useful work on the larger barricade,  

1985
02:27:55,979 --> 02:28:00,839
and Eponine (whom everyone thought 
was a boy) worked hard too.

1986
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:08,460
The barricades were finished in less than an hour 
and, with the sound of drums in the city growing  

1987
02:28:08,460 --> 02:28:14,760
louder, Enjolras brought a table out into the 
street and sat down with his friends for a drink.

1988
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:18,541
Night fell, but nothing happened.

1989
02:28:19,319 --> 02:28:24,359
While the fifty men behind the barricade 
waited impatiently for the arrival of sixty  

1990
02:28:24,359 --> 02:28:29,160
thousand soldiers, Enjolras 
approached the tall, grey-haired man.

1991
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:32,940
'Who are you?' he asked.

1992
02:28:33,720 --> 02:28:37,440
When the man said nothing, 
Enjolras became suspicious.

1993
02:28:38,580 --> 02:28:41,640
'You're a policeman, aren't you?' he said.

1994
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:46,380
The man smiled and eventually 
admitted that he was.

1995
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:50,760
'My name's Javert,' he said.

1996
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:56,340
Before he could move, Enjolras 
ordered four men to search him.

1997
02:28:57,420 --> 02:29:02,280
When they found a letter in his pocket which 
proved that he had been sent to spy on them,  

1998
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:05,819
they tied him to a post inside the inn,

1999
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:14,480
'You'll be shot two minutes before the 
barricade falls,' Enjolras informed him.

2000
02:29:14,479 --> 02:29:15,479
***

2001
02:29:15,479 --> 02:29:20,879
Marius left the garden and, mad 
with grief at losing Cosette,  

2002
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:24,840
walked towards the sound of drums and 
gunfire in the centre of the city.

2003
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:29,340
He had only one thought in 
his mind: he wanted to die.

2004
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:33,720
Marius pushed his way through 
the crowds of frightened,  

2005
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:37,800
murmuring people that filled the streets 
until he reached the market area.

2006
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:43,020
Here, he found the unlit streets 
suddenly filled with soldiers.

2007
02:29:44,399 --> 02:29:49,259
Unafraid, Marius ran through the 
shadows, ignoring shouts for him to stop.

2008
02:29:50,040 --> 02:29:55,439
Someone fired a gun and a bullet hit a 
wall just behind him, but he didn't care.

2009
02:29:57,180 --> 02:30:03,600
He was just approaching the rue de Chanvrerie when 
he heard a loud voice calling from the shadows:  

2010
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:05,939
'Who's there?'

2011
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:15,480
'The French Revolution!' he heard a distant 
voice reply - the voice of his friend, Enjolras.

2012
02:30:16,380 --> 02:30:20,580
Marius stood behind an alley 
wall, hidden in the shadows.

2013
02:30:20,580 --> 02:30:24,420
Around the corner, he could see 
a row of soldiers aiming their  

2014
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:27,540
guns down the rue de Chanvrerie, 
waiting for the order to fire.

2015
02:30:27,540 --> 02:30:31,680
'Fire!' the order finally came.

2016
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:36,720
The street was lit with a sudden flash of 
light and filled with the thunder of gunfire.

2017
02:30:37,859 --> 02:30:39,839
Then the soldiers attacked.

2018
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:44,340
Marius stood up and ran along 
a series of alleys that led  

2019
02:30:44,340 --> 02:30:47,760
into the rue de la Chanvrerie, 
behind the Corinth wine shop.

2020
02:30:49,140 --> 02:30:50,701
When he reached the stronghold,  

2021
02:30:50,700 --> 02:30:54,840
soldiers were already climbing the 
barricade, shooting at the rebels.

2022
02:30:55,620 --> 02:31:00,780
Marius saw a soldier attacking Enjolras, who 
had fallen backwards and was calling for help.

2023
02:31:01,620 --> 02:31:06,420
Marius took Javert's guns from his 
pockets and shot the soldier dead.

2024
02:31:08,220 --> 02:31:10,860
Soldiers now occupied the top of the barricade,  

2025
02:31:10,859 --> 02:31:15,420
but were unable to advance any further 
because the defenders fought so fiercely.

2026
02:31:16,319 --> 02:31:20,099
Marius, who had thrown away his 
guns and was now without a weapon,  

2027
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:25,320
began to move towards a barrel of gunpowder 
he had seen near the door of the wine shop.

2028
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:29,580
He did not notice a soldier aiming his gun at him.

2029
02:31:30,180 --> 02:31:35,820
Neither did he see, at the moment the 
soldier fired, a young boy dressed in  

2030
02:31:35,819 --> 02:31:42,780
rags jump in front of the gun and fall wounded as 
the bullet meant for Marius hit him in the hand.

2031
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:49,140
'Put down your weapons and surrender!' a 
soldier called from the top of the barricade.

2032
02:31:49,859 --> 02:31:51,960
'Fire!' Enjolras shouted.

2033
02:31:52,620 --> 02:31:56,160
The soldiers and the rebels fired 
at each other at the same time,  

2034
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:59,099
filling the air with thick clouds of dark smoke.

2035
02:32:00,060 --> 02:32:04,260
When the smoke cleared, there were 
many dead bodies on both sides.

2036
02:32:04,979 --> 02:32:11,339
The survivors were reloading their guns in 
silence, when suddenly a loud voice called,  

2037
02:32:12,479 --> 02:32:15,839
'Get out now, or I'll blow up the barricade!'

2038
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:20,520
All heads turned to stare in 
the direction of the voice.

2039
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:24,300
Marius was standing at the foot of the barricade,  

2040
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:27,540
holding a flaming torch 
above a barrel of gunpowder.

2041
02:32:28,380 --> 02:32:34,380
'If you blow up the barricade,' a sergeant 
called, 'you'll blow up yourself as well!'

2042
02:32:35,819 --> 02:32:40,200
Marius smiled and lowered the 
torch towards the gunpowder.

2043
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:45,660
Within seconds, the soldiers had left 
the barricade, leaving their dead and  

2044
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:49,939
wounded behind, and were running into the 
darkness at the far end of the street.

2045
02:32:49,939 --> 02:32:54,179
Enjolras threw his arms around Marius's neck.

2046
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:57,359
'So you've come!' he cried.

2047
02:32:58,140 --> 02:33:02,340
Marius hugged Enjolras and many 
other friends he recognized.

2048
02:33:03,660 --> 02:33:07,620
While the soldiers waited at the far 
end of the street for further orders,  

2049
02:33:07,620 --> 02:33:12,960
and the rebels removed dead bodies from 
the barricade and took care of the wounded,  

2050
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:16,200
Marius walked around the 
stronghold in a kind of dream.

2051
02:33:17,399 --> 02:33:22,200
After two months of happiness with 
Cosette, he was now in the middle of a war.

2052
02:33:23,220 --> 02:33:25,560
He could not believe this was happening to him.

2053
02:33:26,460 --> 02:33:30,180
He was so confused that he 
did not recognize Javert,  

2054
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:33,660
tied to a post inside the 
inn throughout the battle.

2055
02:33:34,979 --> 02:33:37,379
As he was walking by the smaller barricade,  

2056
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:42,420
his thoughts were interrupted by a weak 
voice calling his name from the shadows.

2057
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:44,640
'M.

2058
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:45,000
Marius!'

2059
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:50,460
He looked about him but, seeing 
no one, he started to walk away,  

2060
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:52,859
thinking that he was imagining things.

2061
02:33:54,240 --> 02:33:55,080
'M.

2062
02:33:55,080 --> 02:33:57,899
Marius!' He heard the voice again.

2063
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:02,280
Marius gazed into the shadows, 
but could still see nothing.

2064
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:07,020
'I'm at your feet,' the voice said.

2065
02:34:08,399 --> 02:34:13,679
Looking down, Marius saw a dark shape 
crawling along the ground towards him.

2066
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:16,740
By the light of a lamp on the pavement,  

2067
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:23,160
he could see a torn jacket, trousers 
with holes in them, and two bare feet.

2068
02:34:24,479 --> 02:34:32,939
A white face was turned towards him and the 
voice asked, 'Do you recognize me? It's Eponine.'

2069
02:34:34,380 --> 02:34:39,060
Marius bent down quickly, and saw 
that it was indeed that unhappy girl,  

2070
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:40,680
dressed in a man's clothes.

2071
02:34:42,060 --> 02:34:44,460
'What are you doing here?' he said.

2072
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:48,780
Then, noticing the pool of blood 
on the ground behind her, cried,  

2073
02:34:48,780 --> 02:34:52,080
'You're wounded! I'll carry you to the inn.

2074
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:53,640
They'll take care of you there.

2075
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:55,020
Is it very bad?'

2076
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:58,500
She showed him the bullet hole in her hand.

2077
02:35:00,840 --> 02:35:07,080
'A soldier was going to shoot you,' she 
said, her voice no more than a whisper.

2078
02:35:08,040 --> 02:35:11,399
'But I put my hand in front of his gun.'

2079
02:35:12,660 --> 02:35:15,780
'You poor child,' Marius said.

2080
02:35:15,780 --> 02:35:18,599
'We'll put a bandage on that wound immediately.

2081
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:20,040
You'll be all right.'

2082
02:35:21,479 --> 02:35:30,540
'The bullet passed through my hand,' Eponine 
murmured, 'but it came out through my back.

2083
02:35:31,979 --> 02:35:40,679
It's no use trying to move me, but I'll tell you 
how you can treat my wound better than any doctor.

2084
02:35:42,540 --> 02:35:46,800
Sit down on that stone, close beside me.'

2085
02:35:48,120 --> 02:35:50,220
Marius sat next to her.

2086
02:35:50,220 --> 02:35:57,000
She rested her head on his knee and said 
without looking at him, 'Oh, what happiness.

2087
02:35:58,020 --> 02:36:00,720
Now I don't feel any pain,'

2088
02:36:02,280 --> 02:36:03,899
For a moment she was silent.

2089
02:36:04,439 --> 02:36:09,059
She pressed her hand to her chest, from 
which blood was pouring like dark wine.

2090
02:36:10,140 --> 02:36:13,860
Then, with a great effort, she 
raised herself on one arm and,  

2091
02:36:13,859 --> 02:36:16,799
struggling for breath, looked into Marius's eyes.

2092
02:36:18,660 --> 02:36:22,080
'I can't cheat you,' she said at last.

2093
02:36:22,979 --> 02:36:26,040
'I have a letter for you in my pocket.

2094
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:28,979
I've had it since yesterday.

2095
02:36:30,300 --> 02:36:32,760
I was asked to post it, but I didn't.

2096
02:36:33,960 --> 02:36:35,700
I didn't want you to get it.

2097
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:45,420
But now we're both going to die, it doesn't 
matter, does it? I can't be jealous any more.

2098
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:48,840
Take your letter.'

2099
02:36:50,580 --> 02:36:54,600
She took hold of Marius's hand 
with her wounded hand and,  

2100
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:59,940
without seeming to feel the pain, guided it 
to her pocket, from which he took the letter.

2101
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:06,420
'Now you must promise me something 
for my trouble,' she said.

2102
02:37:08,220 --> 02:37:13,680
'You must kiss me on the 
forehead after I'm dead...

2103
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:16,080
I shall know.'

2104
02:37:18,300 --> 02:37:20,580
She let her head fall back on his knees.

2105
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:24,300
Her eyelids trembled, and then she was still.

2106
02:37:26,040 --> 02:37:32,880
Just as Marius thought that her sad soul had 
finally left her body, she slowly opened her eyes,  

2107
02:37:33,720 --> 02:37:41,940
and said in a voice so sweet that it seemed 
already to come from another world, 'You know, M.

2108
02:37:41,939 --> 02:37:46,859
Marius, I think I was a 
little bit in love with you.'

2109
02:37:48,780 --> 02:37:53,639
With those words, she closed her 
eyes for the last time and died.

2110
02:37:55,740 --> 02:37:59,939
Marius kissed her pale forehead 
and laid her gently on the ground.

2111
02:38:02,220 --> 02:38:06,900
Then he returned to the wine shop, and 
opened the letter that she had given him.

2112
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:09,899
By candlelight he read,

2113
02:38:10,859 --> 02:38:15,179
My dearest, We are leaving this house at once.

2114
02:38:16,319 --> 02:38:24,000
We go tonight to Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme, 
and in a week we shall be in England.

2115
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:28,500
Cosette, 4 June.

2116
02:38:30,359 --> 02:38:33,240
Marius covered Cosette's letter with kisses.

2117
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:39,059
So she still loved him! He thought 
for a moment that now he must not die,  

2118
02:38:39,899 --> 02:38:42,479
but then he thought, 'She's going away.'

2119
02:38:43,800 --> 02:38:45,840
She was going with her father to England,  

2120
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:49,980
and his grandfather had refused to 
give his permission for him to marry.

2121
02:38:50,580 --> 02:38:55,620
Nothing had changed, and he decided 
that he had one last duty to perform:  

2122
02:38:56,580 --> 02:39:00,780
he must send Cosette a final 
message and tell her of his death.

2123
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:05,940
He tore a page out of the pocket 
notebook he always carried and wrote:

2124
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:09,240
Our marriage was impossible.

2125
02:39:10,260 --> 02:39:14,400
I went to my grandfather, and he 
refused to give his permission.

2126
02:39:15,420 --> 02:39:18,180
I have no money, and neither have you.

2127
02:39:19,380 --> 02:39:22,260
I hurried to see you, but you had gone.

2128
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:26,100
You remember the promise I made you.

2129
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:28,200
I shall keep it.

2130
02:39:29,100 --> 02:39:30,241
I shall die.

2131
02:39:31,620 --> 02:39:32,519
I love you.

2132
02:39:33,660 --> 02:39:39,540
When you read this, my soul will 
be very near and smiling at you.

2133
02:39:41,399 --> 02:39:47,040
He folded the letter, wrote Cosette's new 
address on the back and called over a young boy.

2134
02:39:48,660 --> 02:39:51,120
'What's your name?' he asked the boy.

2135
02:39:52,020 --> 02:39:52,860
'Gavroche.'

2136
02:39:53,880 --> 02:39:57,120
'Well, Gavroche, will you do something for me?  

2137
02:39:58,439 --> 02:40:02,700
I want you to deliver this letter to 
the address written on the outside.'

2138
02:40:04,319 --> 02:40:07,500
The boy scratched his head, thought for a moment,  

2139
02:40:08,100 --> 02:40:13,201
and then, with a sudden movement, took 
the letter and ran off into the night.

2140
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:15,360
CHAPTER ELEVEN

2141
02:40:16,439 --> 02:40:17,219
The Letter

2142
02:40:19,920 --> 02:40:25,140
Jean Valjean, at that moment, 
was in a state of terrible shock.

2143
02:40:26,460 --> 02:40:30,359
For the first time in their life 
together, he and Cosette had quarrelled.

2144
02:40:31,380 --> 02:40:36,300
She had not wanted to leave the house, 
but she had eventually obeyed him.

2145
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:39,180
They had left quickly, at nightfall,  

2146
02:40:39,180 --> 02:40:43,800
bringing their servant, Toussaint, 
with them, but very little luggage.

2147
02:40:44,700 --> 02:40:47,819
Cosette had brought her letter 
case and blotter with her,  

2148
02:40:47,819 --> 02:40:53,700
Valjean his box of child's clothing and 
the old National Guard uniform which all  

2149
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:58,080
respectable men possessed, and which 
he had worn under a previous identity.

2150
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:02,281
In their new house, they went to bed in silence.

2151
02:41:03,060 --> 02:41:08,880
Cosette, however, did not leave her bedroom the 
next day, and Jean Valjean had dinner alone.

2152
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:13,920
As he was eating, Toussaint told 
him about the fighting in the city,  

2153
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:16,200
but he did not pay much attention.

2154
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:18,780
He was too worried about Cosette.

2155
02:41:19,560 --> 02:41:24,781
There was no reason, he thought, why they should 
not continue to live happily together in England.

2156
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:30,720
As long as he had Cosette, he would be happy, 
and it did not matter where they lived.

2157
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:35,820
He began to feel happier as he thought 
about the journey they would soon be making.

2158
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:41,580
He stood up and was going to leave 
the room when something made him stop.

2159
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:44,460
He glanced again at the mirror.

2160
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:52,139
Cosette's blotter was lying on a cupboard just 
below it and, as Valjean stared at its reflection,  

2161
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:54,540
he read the following lines:

2162
02:41:55,800 --> 02:42:00,060
My dearest, We are leaving this house at once.

2163
02:42:00,060 --> 02:42:06,480
We go tonight to Number 7, rue de 1'Homme-Arme, 
and in a week we shall be in England.

2164
02:42:07,439 --> 02:42:09,660
Cosette, 4June.

2165
02:42:11,399 --> 02:42:17,099
In her unhappy state of mind, Cosette had 
forgotten to remove the page that she had  

2166
02:42:17,100 --> 02:42:19,560
used to blot the letter she had written to Marius.

2167
02:42:20,399 --> 02:42:23,519
She had left it on the cupboard and the mirror,  

2168
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:28,800
reflecting the backwards handwriting, 
made the message clearly visible.

2169
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:37,080
Valjean moved closer to the mirror and read 
the lines again, not wanting to believe them.

2170
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:41,701
But there was no doubt that 
this was Cosette's handwriting.

2171
02:42:42,660 --> 02:42:48,240
He began to shake and he fell back into 
an armchair, feeling angry and betrayed.

2172
02:42:49,080 --> 02:42:54,720
He had suffered terribly over the years and, 
until now, he had survived every disaster.

2173
02:42:55,560 --> 02:43:00,600
But this was the worst thing that 
had ever happened to him - someone  

2174
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:04,621
was threatening to rob him 
of the only person he loved!

2175
02:43:05,880 --> 02:43:09,780
He murmured to himself, 'She's going to leave me,'  

2176
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:15,000
and the pain of those words cut 
into his heart like a knife.

2177
02:43:16,859 --> 02:43:20,639
After a short time, he rose to his 
feet and looked again at the blotter.

2178
02:43:21,180 --> 02:43:27,540
His anger and misery of minutes before 
had been replaced by a terrible calmness.

2179
02:43:28,680 --> 02:43:34,201
He stared at the blotter, coldness in his eyes, 
the darkness of the deepest night in his heart.

2180
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:40,019
He remembered clearly the young man in the 
Luxembourg Gardens who had shown such great  

2181
02:43:40,020 --> 02:43:45,360
interest in Cosette, and he was certain 
that this was the man she had written to.

2182
02:43:46,920 --> 02:43:49,740
He went out into the night 
and sat on the doorstep,  

2183
02:43:49,740 --> 02:43:55,500
his heart filled with a terrible hatred for the 
man who was trying to steal Cosette from him.

2184
02:43:56,939 --> 02:44:02,099
He sat for a long time listening to the 
sound of distant gunfire in the city,  

2185
02:44:02,100 --> 02:44:07,680
wondering how to get his revenge, 
when suddenly he heard footsteps.

2186
02:44:08,520 --> 02:44:11,520
Looking up, he saw a pale-faced boy,  

2187
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:15,840
dressed in rags, studying the 
numbers of the houses in the street.

2188
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:23,940
Seeing Valjean on his doorstep, the boy stopped 
and asked, 'Do you live in this street?'

2189
02:44:25,080 --> 02:44:25,680
'Yes.

2190
02:44:26,280 --> 02:44:26,880
Why?'

2191
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:29,280
'I'm looking for Number Seven.

2192
02:44:30,120 --> 02:44:32,040
I have a letter for a girl who lives here.'

2193
02:44:32,939 --> 02:44:34,620
'Well, I'm the girl's father.

2194
02:44:35,640 --> 02:44:37,260
You can give the letter to me.

2195
02:44:37,260 --> 02:44:43,920
Oh, and one more thing before you go,'Valjean 
said when the boy had handed him the letter.

2196
02:44:44,939 --> 02:44:47,040
'Where should I take the reply?'

2197
02:44:48,540 --> 02:44:54,540
'That letter comes from the barricade in 
the rue de la Chanvrerie,' the boy replied.

2198
02:44:55,260 --> 02:44:56,880
'Which is where I'm going now.

2199
02:44:56,880 --> 02:44:58,500
Goodnight citizen.'

2200
02:44:59,939 --> 02:45:03,540
Jean Valjean went back into 
the house and tried to make  

2201
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:08,939
sense of the words that danced 
before his eyes: I shall die...

2202
02:45:09,899 --> 02:45:14,219
When you read this, my soul will be very near...

2203
02:45:15,660 --> 02:45:19,979
This was enough to fill his 
hate-filled heart with sudden joy.

2204
02:45:20,580 --> 02:45:24,600
So, the problem was solved! The 
man who threatened his happiness  

2205
02:45:24,600 --> 02:45:27,720
was going to die - was perhaps already dead.

2206
02:45:29,280 --> 02:45:33,420
Then Valjean frowned and, 
after a quick calculation,  

2207
02:45:34,140 --> 02:45:36,781
decided that Marius was probably still alive.

2208
02:45:37,979 --> 02:45:39,359
But it made no difference.

2209
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:44,460
He was still certain to die, and 
Valjean's happiness would be safe.

2210
02:45:45,479 --> 02:45:49,859
If he kept the letter in his pocket, 
Cosette would never know what had  

2211
02:45:49,859 --> 02:45:54,599
happened to the other man, and life with 
her would continue the same as before.

2212
02:45:55,680 --> 02:45:56,820
What happiness!

2213
02:45:58,500 --> 02:46:04,200
But his happiness had no sooner returned than 
it disappeared again in a cloud of despair.

2214
02:46:05,399 --> 02:46:08,040
In his heart he knew he had no choice.

2215
02:46:08,700 --> 02:46:12,660
For the sake of Cosette's happiness, 
he would have to try and save the  

2216
02:46:12,660 --> 02:46:17,760
life of the man she loved - the man he 
hated more than any other in the world.

2217
02:46:19,620 --> 02:46:25,800
Half an hour later he left the house, dressed 
in his National Guard uniform, with a loaded  

2218
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:32,100
gun and a pocket full of gunpowder, and made 
his way towards the market district of Paris.

2219
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:36,180
CHAPTER TWELVE

2220
02:46:36,899 --> 02:46:38,339
Fight to the Death

2221
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:44,460
During the night, the thirty-seven 
remaining rebels strengthened the  

2222
02:46:44,460 --> 02:46:46,740
main barricade and made more bullets.

2223
02:46:47,460 --> 02:46:51,240
The ground floor of the wine shop 
became a hospital for the wounded,  

2224
02:46:51,240 --> 02:46:55,800
and the bodies of the dead were taken to an 
alley near the smaller of the two barricades.

2225
02:46:56,580 --> 02:47:01,800
Four of the dead people were National 
Guards, and their uniforms were removed.

2226
02:47:02,939 --> 02:47:04,919
After a long discussion with his friends,  

2227
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:10,020
Enjolras decided that the married men 
(there were five of them) had to leave.

2228
02:47:10,859 --> 02:47:13,979
'It's your duty not to die,' he told them.

2229
02:47:13,979 --> 02:47:15,959
'You must return to your families.'

2230
02:47:16,740 --> 02:47:19,019
'How can we leave?' they protested.

2231
02:47:19,020 --> 02:47:19,860
'We're surrounded.

2232
02:47:19,859 --> 02:47:22,679
The soldiers will shoot us 
as soon as they see us.'

2233
02:47:23,700 --> 02:47:24,960
'You can wear these.'

2234
02:47:25,620 --> 02:47:30,599
Enjolras pointed to the National Guard uniforms 
that had been taken off the dead soldiers.

2235
02:47:31,740 --> 02:47:35,160
'But there are only four,' Marius observed.

2236
02:47:36,120 --> 02:47:40,319
'Then one of us must stay and fight,' 
one of the married men replied.

2237
02:47:41,220 --> 02:47:46,800
A long argument followed, during which each of the 
married men tried to persuade the others to go.

2238
02:47:47,580 --> 02:47:52,620
Finally, someone shouted to Marius, 
'You decide which one must stay.'

2239
02:47:53,939 --> 02:47:58,139
Marius went pale at the thought of 
having to choose which man had to die.

2240
02:47:59,220 --> 02:48:03,781
He stared down at the four 
uniforms but, as he did so,  

2241
02:48:03,780 --> 02:48:08,819
a fifth uniform fell as if by magic at his feet.

2242
02:48:10,260 --> 02:48:13,920
Looking round, Marius recognized Cosette's father.

2243
02:48:14,700 --> 02:48:18,840
Jean Valjean, who had arrived 
unnoticed at the barricade,  

2244
02:48:18,840 --> 02:48:23,160
had been listening to the argument and 
had quickly understood the situation.

2245
02:48:24,240 --> 02:48:27,179
'Now you can all leave,' he said.

2246
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:33,660
The sky grew lighter, but not a door 
or window was open in the street.

2247
02:48:34,740 --> 02:48:38,099
The barricade was stronger than 
it had been for the first assault,  

2248
02:48:38,100 --> 02:48:42,360
and the rebels were at their positions, 
guns loaded and ready for action.

2249
02:48:43,319 --> 02:48:45,000
They did not have long to wait.

2250
02:48:45,720 --> 02:48:50,580
Sounds of chains and of heavy wheels moving 
along the stone streets could be heard,  

2251
02:48:50,580 --> 02:48:55,859
and then soldiers came into view at the 
end of the street, pulling a large cannon.

2252
02:48:56,819 --> 02:49:02,639
The rebels fired their guns but, when the 
smoke had cleared, they saw the soldiers,  

2253
02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:06,600
unharmed, steadily aiming 
the cannon at the barricade.

2254
02:49:07,740 --> 02:49:12,599
Moments later, an officer shouted a 
command and the cannon roared into action.

2255
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:16,080
The cannonball crashed into 
the bottom of the barricade  

2256
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:19,380
with a loud explosion, but did little damage.

2257
02:49:19,380 --> 02:49:21,840
The rebels clapped and cheered.

2258
02:49:22,979 --> 02:49:27,540
More soldiers moved into position at the 
end of the street, behind the cannon,  

2259
02:49:27,540 --> 02:49:31,500
and started to build a low wall 
with pieces of broken stone.

2260
02:49:32,700 --> 02:49:37,859
At the same time, the leader of the gun 
crew adjusted the aim of the cannon.

2261
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:41,819
'Heads down!' Enjolras shouted.

2262
02:49:42,420 --> 02:49:46,800
The next cannonball exploded against 
the wall at one end of the barricade,  

2263
02:49:46,800 --> 02:49:49,380
killing two men and wounding three.

2264
02:49:50,640 --> 02:49:54,420
'We mustn't let that happen again,' Enjolras said.

2265
02:49:54,420 --> 02:49:59,220
He aimed his gun over the barricade at 
the leader of the gun crew, and fired.

2266
02:49:59,880 --> 02:50:06,300
The gunner - a fair-haired, handsome young man 
- spun round twice with his head thrown back,  

2267
02:50:06,300 --> 02:50:08,700
and fell sideways across the cannon.

2268
02:50:08,700 --> 02:50:11,220
Blood poured from the middle of his back.

2269
02:50:12,660 --> 02:50:15,780
A tear rolled down Enjolras's cheek.

2270
02:50:16,920 --> 02:50:21,060
'It's sad,' he murmured to Marius, 
who was standing next to him.

2271
02:50:21,780 --> 02:50:23,399
'He looked a brave young man.'

2272
02:50:24,260 --> 02:50:25,260
***

2273
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:30,781
The battle continued for some time; the cannon 
destroyed the upper windows of the wine shop,  

2274
02:50:30,780 --> 02:50:35,219
and did some damage to the barricade, 
but the rebels did not withdraw.

2275
02:50:35,819 --> 02:50:39,179
They fired back at the soldiers, killing many men.

2276
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:41,880
In the pauses between shooting,  

2277
02:50:41,880 --> 02:50:45,840
the rebels could hear the sound of 
fighting in other parts of Paris.

2278
02:50:46,620 --> 02:50:52,200
They were filled with hope that help would 
come soon, but the hope did not last long.

2279
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:57,240
Within half an hour the sound of 
gunfire in other places had stopped,  

2280
02:50:57,240 --> 02:50:59,700
and the rebels knew that they were alone.

2281
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:06,480
When a second cannon was moved into position next 
to the first, they knew that the end was near.

2282
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:09,600
Both cannons fired together,  

2283
02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:14,701
accompanied by gunfire from soldiers at 
the end of the street and on the rooftops.

2284
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:21,300
As other guns began firing at the smaller 
barricade, the rebels fought back bravely,  

2285
02:51:21,300 --> 02:51:22,920
but they were running out of bullets.

2286
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,160
There were only twenty-six men left,  

2287
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:30,420
and the main attack on the barricade 
was going to take place very soon.

2288
02:51:31,560 --> 02:51:35,340
Some men, including Marius, 
stayed on the main barricade,  

2289
02:51:35,340 --> 02:51:40,140
while the others built a low stone 
wall around the door of the wine shop.

2290
02:51:40,859 --> 02:51:47,040
Enjolras, inside the wine shop, turned to 
Javert, who was still tied to the post.

2291
02:51:48,180 --> 02:51:52,380
'I haven't forgotten you,' he said, 
putting a loaded gun on the table.

2292
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:56,280
'The last man to leave this 
place will blow your brains out.'

2293
02:51:57,840 --> 02:52:01,740
At this point, Jean Valjean spoke to Enjolras.

2294
02:52:02,880 --> 02:52:06,660
'You're the leader, aren't you? 
Can I ask you for a favour?'

2295
02:52:08,220 --> 02:52:10,980
'You saved a man's life by 
giving him your uniform.

2296
02:52:10,979 --> 02:52:12,359
You deserve some reward.

2297
02:52:12,359 --> 02:52:13,620
What do you want?'

2298
02:52:14,460 --> 02:52:16,859
'Let me kill this man.'

2299
02:52:18,359 --> 02:52:22,380
'That's fair,' Enjolras 
decided, when nobody objected.

2300
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:24,480
'You can have your spy.'

2301
02:52:25,979 --> 02:52:31,559
At the same moment there was the sound 
of a drum, followed by a loud roar.

2302
02:52:32,460 --> 02:52:36,060
'They're coming!' cried Marius 
from the top of the barricade.

2303
02:52:36,779 --> 02:52:43,340
The rebels rushed to their positions, leaving 
Valjean alone with Javert inside the wine shop.

2304
02:52:43,340 --> 02:52:48,300
Valjean untied the rope around Javert's feet and,  

2305
02:52:48,300 --> 02:52:51,180
taking him by the belt of 
his coat, led him outside.

2306
02:52:52,439 --> 02:52:55,439
Only Marius, looking over his shoulder,  

2307
02:52:55,439 --> 02:52:59,099
saw them cross the stronghold 
towards the smaller barricade.

2308
02:53:00,180 --> 02:53:05,400
Valjean, his gun in one hand, pulled 
Javert behind him over the barricade  

2309
02:53:05,399 --> 02:53:09,299
and into a narrow alley, where the 
corner of a house hid them from view.

2310
02:53:10,620 --> 02:53:13,800
A terrible heap of dead bodies lay not far away,  

2311
02:53:13,800 --> 02:53:19,940
among them the blood-stained body of a 
young girl in man's clothes - Eponine.

2312
02:53:19,939 --> 02:53:26,219
Javert glanced at the dead body and 
murmured, 'I think I know that girl.

2313
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:33,840
'Then, returning his attention to Valjean, 
he said calmly, 'I think you know me, too.

2314
02:53:35,279 --> 02:53:36,599
Take your revenge.'

2315
02:53:38,040 --> 02:53:44,760
Valjean, however, took a knife from his pocket 
and cut the ropes that tied Javert's wrists.

2316
02:53:45,479 --> 02:53:47,759
'You're free to go,' he said.

2317
02:53:48,840 --> 02:53:54,180
When Javert stared at him, speechless 
with surprise, Valjean went on,  

2318
02:53:55,200 --> 02:53:57,240
I don't suppose I'll leave here alive.

2319
02:53:57,899 --> 02:54:02,580
But if I do, I'm staying at 
Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme.

2320
02:54:03,180 --> 02:54:03,960
Now go.'

2321
02:54:05,819 --> 02:54:09,599
Javert buttoned his coat, 
straightened his shoulders and,  

2322
02:54:09,600 --> 02:54:14,040
with a puzzled look on his face, began to 
walk off in the direction of the market.

2323
02:54:15,300 --> 02:54:19,440
He had only gone a few steps, however, 
when he turned and looked at Valjean.

2324
02:54:20,760 --> 02:54:24,480
'I find this embarrassing,' he said.

2325
02:54:25,439 --> 02:54:27,359
'I'd rather you killed me.'

2326
02:54:28,620 --> 02:54:31,800
'Go away,' Valjean replied.

2327
02:54:33,180 --> 02:54:38,280
Javert walked away slowly and Valjean, 
waiting for him to turn a corner,  

2328
02:54:38,279 --> 02:54:42,479
fired his gun into the air and 
returned to the stronghold.

2329
02:54:44,100 --> 02:54:46,380
'It's done,' he said.

2330
02:54:47,720 --> 02:54:48,720
***

2331
02:54:48,720 --> 02:54:53,640
There was a roar of gunfire and the soldiers 
attacked, rushing towards the barricade.

2332
02:54:53,640 --> 02:54:57,180
Many fell, but many more reached the barricade.

2333
02:54:57,180 --> 02:55:03,360
The first assault was beaten back by the brave 
rebels, but the soldiers attacked again and again.

2334
02:55:04,020 --> 02:55:08,340
Soon, the ground below the barricade 
was piled with dead and wounded men  

2335
02:55:08,340 --> 02:55:11,279
as the rebels and soldiers fought hand to hand.

2336
02:55:12,180 --> 02:55:15,360
The rebels fought long and 
hard to defend the stronghold,  

2337
02:55:16,020 --> 02:55:20,581
but finally they had to withdraw to 
the low wall outside the wine shop.

2338
02:55:21,779 --> 02:55:24,420
They stood with their backs to the door, shooting  

2339
02:55:24,420 --> 02:55:28,380
up at the soldiers who were climbing 
down towards them from the barricade.

2340
02:55:29,520 --> 02:55:33,541
One by one the remaining rebels 
escaped into the wine shop,  

2341
02:55:34,080 --> 02:55:37,559
until only Enjolras and Marius were left outside.

2342
02:55:38,880 --> 02:55:42,900
As the two friends moved back towards 
the door, fighting off the soldiers,  

2343
02:55:43,439 --> 02:55:46,080
a bullet hit Marius in the shoulder.

2344
02:55:47,040 --> 02:55:52,380
His eyes closed and, in great pain, 
he felt a hand grab him as he fell.

2345
02:55:53,640 --> 02:55:58,680
'They've taken me prisoner,' he thought, 
moments before losing consciousness.

2346
02:55:59,460 --> 02:56:00,840
'Now I shall be shot.'

2347
02:56:02,760 --> 02:56:06,300
The soldiers, meanwhile, attacked the wine shop.

2348
02:56:06,300 --> 02:56:09,300
Before long, they broke down 
the door and rushed inside.

2349
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:15,360
Enjolras and the few surviving rebels fought 
bravely, but the soldiers were too strong.

2350
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:21,840
Soon, all the rebels were dead, including 
Enjolras, who was the last to die.

2351
02:56:22,800 --> 02:56:27,060
Sword in hand, surrounded by 
soldiers, he refused to surrender.

2352
02:56:27,660 --> 02:56:33,240
He died in a rain of bullets with a 
strangely victorious smile on his lips.

2353
02:56:35,040 --> 02:56:36,420
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

2354
02:56:37,140 --> 02:56:39,120
The Sewers of Paris

2355
02:56:41,460 --> 02:56:45,840
Marius had indeed been taken 
prisoner, but not by the soldiers.

2356
02:56:46,740 --> 02:56:50,160
It was Jean Valjean's hand 
that had caught him as he fell.

2357
02:56:50,880 --> 02:56:53,819
Valjean had taken no part in the battle.

2358
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:58,859
He had been looking after wounded men 
while bullets flew all around him.

2359
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:04,680
When Marius had been hit, Valjean ran to 
him at once, grabbed him before he fell  

2360
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:09,440
and carried his unconscious body into 
a small alley behind the wine shop.

2361
02:57:09,439 --> 02:57:16,319
Valjean lowered Marius to the ground, stood 
with his back to the wall and looked around him.

2362
02:57:17,399 --> 02:57:18,960
The situation was terrible.

2363
02:57:19,620 --> 02:57:20,939
There seemed to be no escape.

2364
02:57:21,720 --> 02:57:23,940
On one side of him was the field of battle.

2365
02:57:23,939 --> 02:57:26,759
On the other side was the low barricade,  

2366
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:30,960
behind which hundreds of soldiers 
waited for rebels trying to escape.

2367
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:34,200
Both ways meant certain death.

2368
02:57:35,100 --> 02:57:38,580
It was a situation that only a 
bird could have escaped from.

2369
02:57:38,580 --> 02:57:44,819
Valjean looked desperately around him, at the 
house opposite, the barricade, the ground.

2370
02:57:46,080 --> 02:57:48,779
And then he had a sudden idea!

2371
02:57:49,740 --> 02:57:54,899
At the foot of the smaller barricade, 
half-hidden by broken stones and pieces  

2372
02:57:54,899 --> 02:57:59,299
of wood, there was a hole in the 
road covered with an iron grille.

2373
02:57:59,300 --> 02:58:06,120
Valjean leapt forward and, using all his 
strength, he moved the stones and wood,  

2374
02:58:06,779 --> 02:58:13,620
opened the grille, lifted Marius on to his 
shoulders and climbed down into the darkness.

2375
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:19,740
A few minutes later, he found himself 
in a long underground passage,  

2376
02:58:20,340 --> 02:58:23,400
a place of absolute peace and silence.

2377
02:58:24,180 --> 02:58:26,640
He was inside the Paris sewers.

2378
02:58:27,720 --> 02:58:31,440
He could just see, by the grey light 
from the grille above his head,  

2379
02:58:31,439 --> 02:58:33,839
that he was surrounded by walls.

2380
02:58:34,620 --> 02:58:39,000
Ahead of him lay total 
darkness, but he had to go on.

2381
02:58:39,720 --> 02:58:42,660
The soldiers might discover 
the grille by the barricade  

2382
02:58:42,660 --> 02:58:45,420
at any moment, and come down in search of him.

2383
02:58:46,920 --> 02:58:51,720
With Marius lying across his shoulders, 
Valjean walked forward into the darkness,  

2384
02:58:51,720 --> 02:58:56,160
feeling his way along the wet, 
slippery walls with his hands.

2385
02:58:56,880 --> 02:59:01,800
He moved from one passage into another, 
slipping several times on the wet floor.

2386
02:59:02,700 --> 02:59:04,559
He could not see where he was going,  

2387
02:59:05,160 --> 02:59:09,720
but he knew he had to follow the downward 
slope of the passages towards the river.

2388
02:59:10,979 --> 02:59:16,979
He walked blindly downwards in this way for 
a long time, his clothes wet with the blood  

2389
02:59:16,979 --> 02:59:22,200
from Marius's wound, the faint whisper 
of the young man's breath in his ear.

2390
02:59:23,279 --> 02:59:29,160
He walked in total darkness, the silence 
broken occasionally by the thunder of gun  

2391
02:59:29,160 --> 02:59:33,899
carriages and horses racing along the 
streets of Paris far above his head.

2392
02:59:35,160 --> 02:59:39,960
Suddenly, he saw his own shadow on the 
floor of the passage in front of him.

2393
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:44,460
Looking back, he saw the distant light of a torch.

2394
02:59:45,300 --> 02:59:51,480
He was being followed! He pressed himself 
against the wall, held his breath and waited.

2395
02:59:52,680 --> 02:59:57,060
In the distance, a group of men 
formed a circle around the torchlight.

2396
02:59:58,260 --> 03:00:02,580
They seemed to be listening for 
something, waiting for someone to move.

2397
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:07,380
Finally, the group of men moved 
off along another passage,  

2398
03:00:07,380 --> 03:00:10,800
and Valjean was left in total darkness once again.

2399
03:00:12,420 --> 03:00:15,060
He continued his journey through the sewers.

2400
03:00:15,840 --> 03:00:20,940
Sometimes the roof of the passages was so 
low that he had to bend down as he walked.

2401
03:00:21,600 --> 03:00:24,720
His feet slipped all the time 
in the water on the ground,  

2402
03:00:25,500 --> 03:00:29,580
and he felt sick and faint with 
the terrible, airless smell.

2403
03:00:30,840 --> 03:00:34,620
At last, exhausted, he stopped beneath  

2404
03:00:34,620 --> 03:00:38,099
a large grille that brought him 
much-needed light and fresh air.

2405
03:00:39,240 --> 03:00:44,279
He laid Marius down gently at the edge of 
the sewer, and looked down at his face.

2406
03:00:45,120 --> 03:00:48,559
It was covered with blood and as pale as death.

2407
03:00:48,560 --> 03:00:56,100
Valjean tore pieces oft his own shirt and bandaged 
Marius's wounded shoulder as well as he could.

2408
03:00:57,060 --> 03:01:03,480
Then, bending over the unconscious body, Valjean 
stared at Marius with hatred in his eyes.

2409
03:01:05,220 --> 03:01:11,520
He found two objects in Marius's 
clothing: a piece of bread and a wallet.

2410
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:19,680
Valjean ate the bread and, opening the 
wallet, found a note which Marius had written:

2411
03:01:20,880 --> 03:01:23,279
My name is Marius Pontmercy.

2412
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:29,100
My body must be taken to the 
house of my grandfather, M.

2413
03:01:29,100 --> 03:01:33,780
Gillenormand, 6 rue des Filles-du- 
Calvaire, in the Marais.

2414
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:41,399
Valjean repeated the address until he could 
remember it, returned the wallet to Marius's  

2415
03:01:41,399 --> 03:01:47,339
pocket, picked Marius up again and continued 
his journey downwards towards the river.

2416
03:01:48,779 --> 03:01:54,359
He did not know what part of the city he 
was passing under or how far he had come.

2417
03:01:55,080 --> 03:01:58,800
The only thing he was sure of was 
that the light through the grilles  

2418
03:01:58,800 --> 03:02:04,140
far above his head was growing weaker, 
which meant that the sun was setting.

2419
03:02:05,100 --> 03:02:08,460
At one point he had to walk 
waist-deep through water,  

2420
03:02:08,460 --> 03:02:12,540
and almost sank as the ground 
turned to sand beneath his feet.

2421
03:02:13,560 --> 03:02:17,220
Finally, when even his great 
strength was beginning to fade,  

2422
03:02:17,220 --> 03:02:21,960
he saw ahead of him a light 
- the clear light of day.

2423
03:02:22,620 --> 03:02:25,559
He was suddenly filled with 
new energy at the sight,  

2424
03:02:25,560 --> 03:02:28,380
at last, of his way of escape from the sewers.

2425
03:02:29,220 --> 03:02:32,760
Forgetting the weight of Marius 
on his shoulders and his own  

2426
03:02:32,760 --> 03:02:35,820
hunger and tiredness, he ran towards the light.

2427
03:02:36,779 --> 03:02:39,719
He had to bend as the roof 
of the tunnel became lower,  

2428
03:02:40,439 --> 03:02:45,419
but when he reached the light, Valjean 
stopped and gave a cry of despair.

2429
03:02:46,319 --> 03:02:52,859
The opening was closed with a strong iron 
gate, held firm by a huge, rusty lock.

2430
03:02:53,700 --> 03:02:56,819
Through the bars, Valjean could see daylight,  

2431
03:02:56,819 --> 03:03:01,439
the river, a narrow riverbank 
- but how could he get out?

2432
03:03:02,760 --> 03:03:06,840
Valjean laid Marius down by the 
wall, where the floor was dry.

2433
03:03:07,800 --> 03:03:11,520
Then, moving to the gate, he 
shook it fiercely with both hands,  

2434
03:03:11,520 --> 03:03:14,340
trying to bend the bars with 
the last of his strength.

2435
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:18,060
But the gate was solid and the bars were firm.

2436
03:03:19,319 --> 03:03:25,380
Valjean turned his back to the gate and sank to 
the ground, his head bowed between his knees.

2437
03:03:26,399 --> 03:03:33,240
There was no way out and, as all hope of 
escape left him, he began to think of Cosette.

2438
03:03:34,520 --> 03:03:35,520
***

2439
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:40,680
While in this state of despair, 
Valjean felt a hand on his shoulder.

2440
03:03:41,460 --> 03:03:42,779
He thought he was dreaming.

2441
03:03:43,560 --> 03:03:48,720
He looked up and saw a man dressed 
in old clothes standing beside him.

2442
03:03:49,560 --> 03:03:54,900
Despite the unexpectedness of this meeting, 
Valjean recognized the man at once.

2443
03:03:55,680 --> 03:03:57,180
It was Thenardier.

2444
03:03:58,200 --> 03:04:01,200
Valjean did not show that he recognized the man,  

2445
03:04:01,200 --> 03:04:05,460
and saw with relief that 
Thenardier had not recognized him.

2446
03:04:06,899 --> 03:04:10,259
'I'll make a bargain with you,' the man said.

2447
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:11,939
'What do you mean?'

2448
03:04:12,840 --> 03:04:15,300
Thenardier nodded in Marius's direction.

2449
03:04:16,260 --> 03:04:17,640
'You've killed a man.

2450
03:04:18,300 --> 03:04:24,480
Give me half of what you found in this man's 
pockets, and I'll unlock the gate for you.'

2451
03:04:25,560 --> 03:04:29,880
He produced a large key from 
his pocket, and a piece of rope.

2452
03:04:29,880 --> 03:04:32,640
'I'll give you this as well,' he said.

2453
03:04:32,640 --> 03:04:37,620
'Then you can tie stones to the 
body and throw it in the river.'

2454
03:04:39,180 --> 03:04:41,701
Valjean took the rope without speaking.

2455
03:04:42,840 --> 03:04:46,680
'What about my share of the 
money?'Thenardier asked.

2456
03:04:47,700 --> 03:04:52,080
Valjean took thirty francs from his 
pockets and showed it to Thenardier,  

2457
03:04:52,080 --> 03:04:54,000
who stared with disbelief.

2458
03:04:54,660 --> 03:04:59,099
'You killed a man for just 
thirty francs? You're a fool.'

2459
03:05:00,240 --> 03:05:04,439
He searched Marius's pockets 
himself, and then Valjean's.

2460
03:05:05,220 --> 03:05:07,440
'It's true,' he said at last.

2461
03:05:07,439 --> 03:05:08,879
'That's all there is.

2462
03:05:09,540 --> 03:05:10,500
Oh well.

2463
03:05:10,500 --> 03:05:13,140
Never say that I'm not a kind man.'

2464
03:05:14,399 --> 03:05:19,679
He took the thirty francs and, helping 
Valjean to lift Marius on to his shoulders,  

2465
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:25,920
he put the key in the lock and opened the gate 
just wide enough for Valjean to pass through.

2466
03:05:27,180 --> 03:05:33,000
When Valjean was outside, Thenardier 
closed the gate behind him and disappeared,  

2467
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:36,420
like a rat, into the darkness of the sewers.

2468
03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:38,279
***

2469
03:05:38,279 --> 03:05:41,880
Valjean laid Marius gently 
on the grass and stood up,  

2470
03:05:41,880 --> 03:05:46,740
surrounded by silence, enjoying the 
feeling of fresh air on his face.

2471
03:05:47,939 --> 03:05:52,500
Then, just as he was bending to splash 
water from the river on Marius's face,  

2472
03:05:53,279 --> 03:05:56,279
he was aware of someone else standing behind him.

2473
03:05:57,180 --> 03:06:02,520
He looked round quickly and saw a tall man 
in a long coat, a large stick in his hand.

2474
03:06:03,720 --> 03:06:10,920
Although the man's face was hidden in shadow, 
Valjean recognized him as Inspector Javert.

2475
03:06:11,880 --> 03:06:16,020
Javert, however, did not 
recognize Valjean at first.

2476
03:06:16,020 --> 03:06:18,720
He had been more interested 
in catching Thenardier,  

2477
03:06:18,720 --> 03:06:22,080
who had escaped from prison and 
was known to be in the area.

2478
03:06:23,939 --> 03:06:26,339
'Who are you?' he asked.

2479
03:06:27,120 --> 03:06:30,660
Valjean told him his name 
and stood, without moving,  

2480
03:06:30,660 --> 03:06:33,599
as Javert approached and stared into his eyes.

2481
03:06:35,399 --> 03:06:39,120
'Inspector Javert,' Valjean said quietly.

2482
03:06:39,720 --> 03:06:41,880
'I beg you to do me one favour.

2483
03:06:42,600 --> 03:06:45,060
I promise not to try and escape.

2484
03:06:46,140 --> 03:06:49,080
I gave you my address this 
morning, if you remember,  

2485
03:06:49,740 --> 03:06:51,779
so you would know where to find me anyway.'

2486
03:06:53,220 --> 03:06:54,960
Javert did not seem to hear.

2487
03:06:55,920 --> 03:07:00,899
He stared into Valjean's eyes for a long 
time, then, stepping back with a look  

2488
03:07:00,899 --> 03:07:09,240
of confusion in his eyes, asked dreamily, 
'What are you doing here? Who is this man?'

2489
03:07:10,859 --> 03:07:14,819
'Will you help me to take him home?' Valjean said.

2490
03:07:14,819 --> 03:07:16,439
'He's badly injured.'

2491
03:07:17,760 --> 03:07:21,240
Javert looked unhappy, but he did not refuse.

2492
03:07:22,020 --> 03:07:24,900
Bending down, he took a 
handkerchief from his pocket,  

2493
03:07:24,899 --> 03:07:29,040
wet it in the river and bathed 
Marius's blood-stained forehead.

2494
03:07:29,880 --> 03:07:32,220
Then he felt Marius's wrist.

2495
03:07:33,420 --> 03:07:35,640
'He's dead,' he said.

2496
03:07:35,640 --> 03:07:41,760
'No, not yet,' Valjean replied, feeling 
in Marius's jacket for the wallet.

2497
03:07:41,760 --> 03:07:46,680
'Look,' he said, showing Javert the note 
with Marius's grandfather's address.

2498
03:07:47,580 --> 03:07:49,380
'That's where we need to take him.'

2499
03:07:50,760 --> 03:07:55,560
Javert shouted to the driver who was waiting for 
him to bring his carriage close to the river.

2500
03:07:56,399 --> 03:08:00,779
With Marius in the back seat, Valjean 
and Javert side by side in the front,  

2501
03:08:00,779 --> 03:08:06,300
the carriage drove off quickly through the 
dark and strangely empty streets of Paris.

2502
03:08:08,700 --> 03:08:10,380
When they arrived at M.

2503
03:08:10,380 --> 03:08:13,200
Gillenormand's house, a servant answered the door.

2504
03:08:13,859 --> 03:08:14,639
'Does M.

2505
03:08:14,640 --> 03:08:18,420
Gillenormand live here?' Javert asked.

2506
03:08:18,420 --> 03:08:19,080
'Yes.

2507
03:08:19,080 --> 03:08:20,460
What do you want?'

2508
03:08:21,180 --> 03:08:23,400
'We're bringing back his grandson.

2509
03:08:23,399 --> 03:08:25,139
He's dead.

2510
03:08:25,140 --> 03:08:26,640
Go and wake his grandfather.

2511
03:08:26,640 --> 03:08:27,780
We're bringing him in.'

2512
03:08:27,779 --> 03:08:36,120
Javert, Valjean and the driver carried Marius 
into the house and laid him gently on a sofa in M.

2513
03:08:36,120 --> 03:08:37,260
Gillenormand's sitting-room.

2514
03:08:38,399 --> 03:08:43,379
While one servant ran to find a doctor 
and another looked for clean sheets,  

2515
03:08:43,380 --> 03:08:46,440
Valjean felt Javert's hand on his arm.

2516
03:08:47,460 --> 03:08:51,720
He understood, and went downstairs 
with Javert close behind him.

2517
03:08:52,560 --> 03:08:56,581
When they had got back into the 
carriage, however, Valjean said,  

2518
03:08:57,300 --> 03:09:02,880
'Inspector, will you do one last 
thing for me before you arrest me?'

2519
03:09:04,080 --> 03:09:07,319
'What is it? 'Javert replied impatiently.

2520
03:09:08,399 --> 03:09:10,439
'Let me go home for a minute.

2521
03:09:11,100 --> 03:09:14,400
After that, you can do whatever you want with me.'

2522
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:20,940
Javert was silent for some moments, his 
chin sunk in the collar of his overcoat.

2523
03:09:21,660 --> 03:09:23,880
Then he pulled down the window in front of him.

2524
03:09:24,479 --> 03:09:29,040
'Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme,' 
he told the driver.

2525
03:09:30,660 --> 03:09:32,760
Neither man spoke during the journey.

2526
03:09:33,540 --> 03:09:38,100
At the end of the rue de l'Homme-Arme, which 
was too narrow for the carriage to enter,  

2527
03:09:38,700 --> 03:09:43,260
Javert paid the driver and accompanied 
Valjean to his front door on foot.

2528
03:09:44,580 --> 03:09:49,439
'Go in,' said Javert, with a 
strange, distant look in his eyes.

2529
03:09:50,279 --> 03:09:51,719
'I'll wait for you here.'

2530
03:09:52,279 --> 03:09:59,639
Valjean went into his house and 
called, 'It's me!' Climbing the stairs,  

2531
03:09:59,640 --> 03:10:03,960
he paused for a moment to look out of 
the window to see what Javert was doing.

2532
03:10:05,340 --> 03:10:09,060
But the street was empty; there was no one there.

2533
03:10:10,620 --> 03:10:17,040
The next morning, Inspector Javert's body 
was discovered floating in the river.

2534
03:10:18,359 --> 03:10:22,979
The poor man, unable to understand 
the kindness and gentle nature of the  

2535
03:10:22,979 --> 03:10:29,459
man he had spent his whole life hating, had 
taken his own life by jumping from a bridge.

2536
03:10:30,600 --> 03:10:36,180
It was the only way he knew to escape the 
confusion that was poisoning his heart.

2537
03:10:38,540 --> 03:10:39,540
***

2538
03:10:39,540 --> 03:10:41,460
When M.

2539
03:10:41,460 --> 03:10:45,840
Gillenormand saw his pale, lifeless-looking 
grandson lying on the sofa,  

2540
03:10:45,840 --> 03:10:47,580
he shook from head to foot.

2541
03:10:48,540 --> 03:10:52,560
Leaning against the door for 
support, he murmured, 'Marius!'

2542
03:10:54,180 --> 03:10:56,940
'He has just been brought here,' said a servant.

2543
03:10:56,939 --> 03:10:59,099
'He was on the barricade and

2544
03:10:59,100 --> 03:11:03,661
'He's dead!' cried the old 
man in a terrible voice.

2545
03:11:03,660 --> 03:11:09,359
'The fool! He did this to 
hurt me, the ungrateful boy.

2546
03:11:10,140 --> 03:11:14,400
I try to be good to him, and 
this is how he rewards me!'

2547
03:11:15,960 --> 03:11:20,040
The old man walked to the window and, 
while he complained to the night about  

2548
03:11:20,040 --> 03:11:24,660
the pain and grief his grandson 
had caused him, the doctor arrived.

2549
03:11:25,620 --> 03:11:30,840
After listening to Marius's heart, he 
organized his removal to a bed in another room,  

2550
03:11:31,439 --> 03:11:33,599
and returned to M.

2551
03:11:33,600 --> 03:11:35,640
Gillenormand, who was still 
standing by the window.

2552
03:11:36,840 --> 03:11:38,168
'Will he live?' M.

2553
03:11:38,168 --> 03:11:42,779
Gillenormand asked, his eyes wild with fear.

2554
03:11:43,920 --> 03:11:47,160
'I don't know,' the doctor replied.

2555
03:11:47,700 --> 03:11:52,979
'The wound to his body is not serious, 
but there are deep cuts on his head.

2556
03:11:52,979 --> 03:11:58,439
It's difficult to say M.

2557
03:11:58,439 --> 03:12:00,000
Gillenormand went to Marius's bedside.

2558
03:12:00,660 --> 03:12:04,380
'You heartless boy,' he said angrily.

2559
03:12:04,380 --> 03:12:08,880
'A fool who prefers fighting 
to dancing and having fun.

2560
03:12:09,479 --> 03:12:15,660
What kind of man are you? Are you 
mad? But it makes no difference.

2561
03:12:16,380 --> 03:12:17,940
I too shall die.

2562
03:12:18,840 --> 03:12:23,460
That makes you a murderer, a cold-hearted killer.

2563
03:12:24,060 --> 03:12:26,100
I cannot feel grief for you.

2564
03:12:27,779 --> 03:12:35,359
At that moment, Marius's eyes slowly 
opened and his gaze rested upon M.

2565
03:12:35,359 --> 03:12:36,359
Gillenormand.

2566
03:12:36,359 --> 03:12:39,420
'Marius!' the old man cried.

2567
03:12:39,420 --> 03:12:46,260
'Marius, my child, grandson! 
You're alive after all!'

2568
03:12:47,279 --> 03:12:48,840
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

2569
03:12:49,500 --> 03:12:50,279
The Wedding

2570
03:12:51,200 --> 03:12:56,639
Marius lay for a long time between 
life and death in a state of fever,  

2571
03:12:56,640 --> 03:12:59,520
endlessly repeating the name of Cosette.

2572
03:13:00,359 --> 03:13:03,599
'He mustn't get excited,' the doctor warned.

2573
03:13:04,500 --> 03:13:08,399
Every day, according to one of 
the servants, a white-haired,  

2574
03:13:08,399 --> 03:13:11,759
well-dressed gentleman came to 
ask for news of the sick man.

2575
03:13:13,020 --> 03:13:18,000
Finally, after three months, the doctor 
announced that Marius was out of danger.

2576
03:13:18,720 --> 03:13:23,760
But he had to spend the next two months 
resting because of the damage to his shoulder.

2577
03:13:24,840 --> 03:13:25,620
M.

2578
03:13:25,620 --> 03:13:29,700
Gillenormand grew happier as his 
grandson's condition improved.

2579
03:13:30,240 --> 03:13:36,179
He did strange, unexpected things, like 
running up and down stairs without knowing why.

2580
03:13:36,899 --> 03:13:42,299
He gave his neighbour, a pretty woman, a bunch 
of flowers, which greatly annoyed her husband.

2581
03:13:43,740 --> 03:13:47,519
Marius, meanwhile, tried to make 
sense of what had happened to him.

2582
03:13:48,479 --> 03:13:51,419
He thought about Enjolras and Eponine,  

2583
03:13:51,420 --> 03:13:55,260
and wondered why Cosette's 
father had been at the barricade.

2584
03:13:56,040 --> 03:14:00,300
He could not understand why nobody 
could tell him how he had been saved.

2585
03:14:00,840 --> 03:14:05,279
All he knew was that he had been brought 
to his grandfather's house in a carriage.

2586
03:14:06,060 --> 03:14:10,320
He noticed his grandfather's tenderness 
towards him, but he could not forget  

2587
03:14:10,319 --> 03:14:16,380
the old man's unfairness and cruelty to his 
father, who had died penniless and unloved.

2588
03:14:17,220 --> 03:14:22,020
Most of all, however, he thought about 
Cosette, and how he could find her again.

2589
03:14:24,120 --> 03:14:29,160
'There's something I have to say to you,' 
Marius told his grandfather one day.

2590
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:30,899
'What is it?'

2591
03:14:31,680 --> 03:14:32,880
'I want to get married.'

2592
03:14:32,880 --> 03:14:36,480
'But of course,' the old man laughed.

2593
03:14:37,020 --> 03:14:38,400
'What do you mean - of course?'

2594
03:14:38,399 --> 03:14:40,319
'That's understood.

2595
03:14:40,319 --> 03:14:43,080
You will have your little girl.'

2596
03:14:44,399 --> 03:14:49,319
'I don't understand,' Marius said, 
almost speechless with amazement.

2597
03:14:49,979 --> 03:14:53,399
'You will have her,' the old man repeated.

2598
03:14:53,399 --> 03:15:00,000
'She comes here every day in the shape 
of an old man who asks for news of you.

2599
03:15:00,540 --> 03:15:06,420
While you've been ill, she's spent her 
time crying and making bandages for you.

2600
03:15:06,420 --> 03:15:08,940
I know all about her.

2601
03:15:09,479 --> 03:15:14,099
She lives at Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme.

2602
03:15:14,100 --> 03:15:17,340
You see, I'm not as unkind as you think.

2603
03:15:17,880 --> 03:15:22,560
I've found out that she's a charming 
girl and that she loves you.

2604
03:15:23,220 --> 03:15:30,060
I knew you were angry with me, and I 
thought, "What can I do to make him love me?"  

2605
03:15:30,660 --> 03:15:34,859
Then I thought, "I can give him Cosette."  

2606
03:15:35,520 --> 03:15:42,000
I wanted to invite her to see you, but the doctor 
warned me that you would probably get too excited.

2607
03:15:42,720 --> 03:15:48,360
So I advise you, dear boy, to eat 
more meat and get better soon.

2608
03:15:48,359 --> 03:15:52,200
Then you can marry your Cosette and be happy.'

2609
03:15:53,340 --> 03:15:57,180
Having said this, the old man burst into tears.

2610
03:15:57,180 --> 03:16:01,080
He held Marius's head to his 
chest and they cried together.

2611
03:16:02,819 --> 03:16:08,460
'Grandfather,' Marius said at last, 
'I'm feeling much better already.

2612
03:16:09,420 --> 03:16:10,680
When can I see her?'

2613
03:16:11,220 --> 03:16:12,840
'You can see her tomorrow.'

2614
03:16:13,979 --> 03:16:14,879
'Why not today?'

2615
03:16:15,899 --> 03:16:18,359
'All right, I'll fetch her today.

2616
03:16:19,140 --> 03:16:24,840
You've called me "grandfather"; you've 
shown me that you love me after all.

2617
03:16:24,840 --> 03:16:27,120
You've earned your reward!'

2618
03:16:28,460 --> 03:16:29,460
***

2619
03:16:29,460 --> 03:16:33,036
Later that day, Cosette arrived at M.

2620
03:16:33,036 --> 03:16:33,300
Gillenormand's house.

2621
03:16:34,020 --> 03:16:40,201
Standing beside her on the doorstep was a 
white-haired man with a strangely nervous smile.

2622
03:16:40,200 --> 03:16:40,352
M.

2623
03:16:40,352 --> 03:16:45,300
Gillenormand showed them up to 
the room where Marius was waiting.

2624
03:16:46,020 --> 03:16:49,201
Cosette stood in the doorway, 
overcome with happiness.

2625
03:16:49,740 --> 03:16:52,559
She wanted to throw herself into Marius's arms,  

2626
03:16:52,560 --> 03:16:57,060
but was unable to move, afraid to 
show the world that she loved him.

2627
03:16:58,080 --> 03:16:59,279
'Monsieur.'

2628
03:16:59,880 --> 03:17:00,264
M.

2629
03:17:00,264 --> 03:17:00,300
Gillenormand addressed Jean Valjean.

2630
03:17:00,300 --> 03:17:09,000
'I have the honour, on behalf of 
my grandson, Marius Pontmercy,  

2631
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:12,899
to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage.'

2632
03:17:13,800 --> 03:17:15,600
Jean Valjean bowed.

2633
03:17:16,200 --> 03:17:19,859
'Good, then that is agreed,' M.

2634
03:17:19,859 --> 03:17:24,179
Gillenormand said and, turning 
to Marius and Cosette, he added,  

2635
03:17:24,180 --> 03:17:28,440
'My children, you are free to love one another.'

2636
03:17:30,240 --> 03:17:33,960
When they were alone together, 
Cosette and Marius kissed.

2637
03:17:35,279 --> 03:17:38,700
'Is it really you?' Cosette murmured at last.

2638
03:17:38,700 --> 03:17:40,380
'I can't believe it.

2639
03:17:40,920 --> 03:17:43,560
I'm so happy to see you.

2640
03:17:43,560 --> 03:17:47,400
I was so excited today that I 
haven't even dressed up for you.

2641
03:17:47,399 --> 03:17:48,839
I must look terrible.

2642
03:17:50,279 --> 03:17:54,420
But why don't you say something? Why 
are you letting me do all the talking?  

2643
03:17:55,620 --> 03:17:59,580
Do you still love me? Oh, 
I'm so wild with happiness

2644
03:18:00,840 --> 03:18:01,680
'My love...'

2645
03:18:02,880 --> 03:18:03,840
Marius whispered.

2646
03:18:05,720 --> 03:18:06,720
***

2647
03:18:06,720 --> 03:18:09,600
The wedding was arranged for 
February the following year.

2648
03:18:10,439 --> 03:18:12,419
Jean Valjean arranged everything.

2649
03:18:13,140 --> 03:18:18,661
Having been a mayor, he knew how to solve an 
awkward problem: the question of Cosette's  

2650
03:18:18,660 --> 03:18:24,120
real family He told everybody that he 
was not her father, but her guardian.

2651
03:18:24,720 --> 03:18:31,080
He also invented a dead family for Cosette, 
so that everybody believed she was an orphan.

2652
03:18:31,080 --> 03:18:35,939
Valjean, as her guardian, 
gave Cosette a large amount  

2653
03:18:35,939 --> 03:18:41,639
of money - half a million francs - but 
did not tell her that the money was his.

2654
03:18:42,660 --> 03:18:47,040
He told her that the money came from 
a man who preferred to remain unknown.

2655
03:18:48,240 --> 03:18:52,080
It was arranged that the couple, 
who could not believe their sudden,  

2656
03:18:52,080 --> 03:18:55,380
new-found happiness, would live with M.

2657
03:18:55,380 --> 03:18:56,279
Gillenormand after the wedding.

2658
03:18:57,540 --> 03:19:02,340
Cosette, accompanied by Jean 
Valjean, visited Marius every day.

2659
03:19:03,180 --> 03:19:06,120
Marius did not speak much to Valjean.

2660
03:19:06,120 --> 03:19:12,000
Despite enjoying an occasional conversation with 
him, he found something strange about the old man.

2661
03:19:12,840 --> 03:19:16,380
He could not believe that this 
was the same man he had seen at  

2662
03:19:16,380 --> 03:19:21,300
the barricade all those months ago 
- it seemed like a bad dream to him.

2663
03:19:22,439 --> 03:19:25,740
But there were more important 
things for Marius to think about.

2664
03:19:25,740 --> 03:19:31,139
Apart from preparing for his wedding, there 
were two people that he wanted to find.

2665
03:19:31,859 --> 03:19:34,259
First, there was Thenardier.

2666
03:19:34,979 --> 03:19:41,519
He was, without doubt, a bad man, but Marius had 
promised his father to find him and help him.

2667
03:19:42,180 --> 03:19:46,140
He employed agents to find 
Thenardier, but without success.

2668
03:19:47,100 --> 03:19:51,540
The only thing they discovered 
was that Mme Thenardier had died,  

2669
03:19:51,540 --> 03:19:58,560
and that her husband had escaped from prison and 
disappeared with his surviving daughter, Azelma.

2670
03:19:59,640 --> 03:20:03,780
Second, there was the mysterious 
stranger who had saved his life.

2671
03:20:04,560 --> 03:20:08,880
Marius's attempts to find 
him also ended in failure,  

2672
03:20:08,880 --> 03:20:14,460
and the true story of his escape from the 
barricade remained a complete mystery to him.

2673
03:20:16,080 --> 03:20:18,899
One evening, when Marius was talking to Cosette  

2674
03:20:18,899 --> 03:20:24,299
and Jean Valjean about the mystery and 
his unsuccessful attempts to solve it,  

2675
03:20:24,300 --> 03:20:28,500
he became angry with Cosette's 
guardian's lack of interest in his story.

2676
03:20:29,640 --> 03:20:32,400
'The man was a hero,' Marius said.

2677
03:20:33,120 --> 03:20:36,599
'Do you realize, Monsieur, how brave this man was?  

2678
03:20:37,260 --> 03:20:42,060
He rescued me from the field of battle and 
carried me through the sewers of Paris.

2679
03:20:42,060 --> 03:20:48,540
He risked his life to save a dying 
man, and why? He was a total stranger.

2680
03:20:49,200 --> 03:20:51,359
He did it without any thought of a reward.

2681
03:20:52,020 --> 03:20:54,360
Oh, I wish Cosette's money were mine.'

2682
03:20:55,140 --> 03:20:59,040
'It is yours,' Valjean reminded him.

2683
03:20:59,040 --> 03:21:02,340
'I would give it all,' said 
Marius,'to find that man!'

2684
03:21:02,340 --> 03:21:05,640
Jean Valjean was silent.

2685
03:21:06,620 --> 03:21:07,620
***

2686
03:21:07,620 --> 03:21:10,979
Cosette and Marius made a handsome 
couple on their wedding day.

2687
03:21:10,979 --> 03:21:18,359
All previous unhappiness was forgotten as they 
kissed in the church, watched proudly by M.

2688
03:21:18,359 --> 03:21:19,620
Gillenormand and Jean Valjean.

2689
03:21:20,220 --> 03:21:23,400
There were flowers everywhere 
when they returned to M.

2690
03:21:23,399 --> 03:21:25,500
Gillenormand's house for the wedding feast.

2691
03:21:26,220 --> 03:21:28,680
It was the happiest night of Cosette's life,  

2692
03:21:29,340 --> 03:21:35,400
spoilt only by one thing: the fact that her 
guardian - whom she still thought of as her  

2693
03:21:35,399 --> 03:21:40,559
father - went home before the feast 
had started, saying that he felt ill.

2694
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:43,621
But Cosette was not unhappy for long.

2695
03:21:43,620 --> 03:21:48,359
She had Marius, and she would be happy 
with him for the rest of her life!

2696
03:21:48,359 --> 03:21:55,859
Jean Valjean, meanwhile, went home, lit 
his candle and went upstairs to bed.

2697
03:21:56,819 --> 03:21:59,399
That night, however, he was unable to sleep.

2698
03:22:00,060 --> 03:22:04,500
He remembered the little girl he had rescued 
from the Thenardiers ten years earlier,  

2699
03:22:04,500 --> 03:22:08,880
and felt sad that he was no longer 
the most important man in her life.

2700
03:22:09,899 --> 03:22:12,420
Another man was the centre of her universe.

2701
03:22:13,620 --> 03:22:18,180
He was proud of having helped to bring 
her happiness with Marius, but another  

2702
03:22:18,180 --> 03:22:25,201
thing troubled his soul: the fact that nobody, 
not even Cosette, knew the truth about him.

2703
03:22:26,040 --> 03:22:32,519
That he was Jean Valjean, a criminal who 
had spent nineteen years in prison and who  

2704
03:22:32,520 --> 03:22:36,541
had stolen silver candlesticks from 
a trusting and kind-hearted bishop.

2705
03:22:37,439 --> 03:22:41,160
He knew that if he told 
Cosette and Marius the truth,  

2706
03:22:41,160 --> 03:22:46,319
he would spoil everybody's happiness and 
he would lose their love and respect.

2707
03:22:47,279 --> 03:22:52,439
On the other hand, if he continued to lie 
about his past, he would lose his own soul.

2708
03:22:53,760 --> 03:22:54,780
What could he do?

2709
03:22:55,819 --> 03:22:56,819
***

2710
03:22:56,819 --> 03:22:59,519
The next day Valjean visited M.

2711
03:22:59,520 --> 03:23:03,180
Gillenormand's house, and asked 
to speak to Marius in private.

2712
03:23:03,960 --> 03:23:09,300
Marius hugged Valjean warmly, addressed 
him as 'father' and invited him to lunch,  

2713
03:23:10,200 --> 03:23:17,399
but Valjean shook his head and said, 
'Monsieur, I have something to tell you.'

2714
03:23:18,840 --> 03:23:23,100
Marius listened quietly as Valjean 
told him everything about his life.

2715
03:23:24,120 --> 03:23:28,680
Finally, in a state of shock and 
confusion, the young man said,  

2716
03:23:29,340 --> 03:23:33,360
'Why have you told me all 
this? No one forced you to.'

2717
03:23:34,560 --> 03:23:37,621
'If I had continued to keep my secret to myself,  

2718
03:23:38,580 --> 03:23:42,720
I would have destroyed my 
own heart,' Valjean replied.

2719
03:23:43,380 --> 03:23:46,620
'Besides, I belong to no family.

2720
03:23:47,580 --> 03:23:50,580
Cosette was the only family I ever had.

2721
03:23:51,600 --> 03:23:54,780
Everything ended for me when 
she married you yesterday.

2722
03:23:55,859 --> 03:23:58,319
She is happy with the man she loves.

2723
03:23:59,279 --> 03:24:04,439
I tried to persuade myself that it would be 
better not to admit the truth about my past,  

2724
03:24:05,700 --> 03:24:06,840
but it was no use.

2725
03:24:07,560 --> 03:24:11,280
I could not silence the voice that 
speaks to me when I am alone.'

2726
03:24:13,260 --> 03:24:15,360
Neither of them spoke for several minutes.

2727
03:24:16,020 --> 03:24:19,621
Then Marius murmured, 'Poor Cosette.

2728
03:24:20,460 --> 03:24:21,779
When she hears

2729
03:24:21,779 --> 03:24:25,859
'But you must promise not to 
tell her!' Valjean interrupted.

2730
03:24:25,859 --> 03:24:29,160
'She'll be heart-broken if 
she hears the truth about me.

2731
03:24:29,880 --> 03:24:31,819
I don't think I could bear it...

2732
03:24:31,819 --> 03:24:32,819
'

2733
03:24:32,819 --> 03:24:36,359
He sank into an armchair and 
buried his face in his hands.

2734
03:24:37,859 --> 03:24:40,559
'Don't worry,' Marius said at last.

2735
03:24:41,399 --> 03:24:42,660
'I'll keep your secret.

2736
03:24:43,680 --> 03:24:46,980
But I think it would be better 
if you stopped seeing her.'

2737
03:24:48,420 --> 03:24:52,980
'I understand,' Valjean said, rising to leave.

2738
03:24:53,580 --> 03:24:57,239
But at the door he half-turned 
and said, 'Monsieur,  

2739
03:24:57,960 --> 03:25:02,279
if you will permit me, I would 
like to come and see her.

2740
03:25:02,880 --> 03:25:05,580
I wouldn't come often or stay very long.

2741
03:25:06,660 --> 03:25:09,720
We could meet in that little 
room on the ground floor.

2742
03:25:11,220 --> 03:25:18,000
Please Monsieur, if I can't see Cosette 
again, I'll have nothing left to live for.

2743
03:25:18,720 --> 03:25:24,720
Besides, if I suddenly stopped visiting, people 
would become suspicious and begin to talk

2744
03:25:26,340 --> 03:25:30,120
'You can come every evening,' said Marius.

2745
03:25:30,660 --> 03:25:38,040
'Monsieur, you are very kind,' said Jean Valjean, 
shaking Marius's hand and leaving the room.

2746
03:25:39,660 --> 03:25:40,979
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

2747
03:25:41,939 --> 03:25:43,439
The Truth at Last

2748
03:25:45,600 --> 03:25:48,780
Marius kept his promise about not telling Cosette,  

2749
03:25:48,779 --> 03:25:53,460
and Valjean visited her every evening 
in a small room on the ground floor.

2750
03:25:54,359 --> 03:26:00,420
It was cold and damp, but a fire had been lit 
and two armchairs had been placed in front of it.

2751
03:26:01,500 --> 03:26:06,060
At first, Cosette could not understand 
why Valjean refused to meet her upstairs.

2752
03:26:07,380 --> 03:26:12,000
When he refused to kiss her 
cheek, she began to feel unhappy,  

2753
03:26:12,000 --> 03:26:14,520
afraid that she had done something to offend him.

2754
03:26:15,180 --> 03:26:18,780
She pressed his hands in hers 
and held them to her lips.

2755
03:26:19,680 --> 03:26:23,220
'Please, please be kind!' she begged.

2756
03:26:24,180 --> 03:26:26,100
'I want you to come and live with us.

2757
03:26:26,640 --> 03:26:30,720
You'll always be my father and 
I'm not going to let you go.'

2758
03:26:31,920 --> 03:26:33,480
He released his hands.

2759
03:26:34,319 --> 03:26:38,759
'You mustn't call me "father" 
any more,' he told her.

2760
03:26:39,600 --> 03:26:42,661
'You must call me "Monsieur Jean".'

2761
03:26:43,979 --> 03:26:47,519
'I don't understand,' she said, becoming angry.

2762
03:26:47,520 --> 03:26:48,900
'This is ridiculous.

2763
03:26:48,899 --> 03:26:52,739
You're upsetting me very much, and I 
don't know why you're being so cruel.'

2764
03:26:53,760 --> 03:26:56,220
'You don't need a father any more.

2765
03:26:57,180 --> 03:26:58,440
You have a husband.'

2766
03:26:59,279 --> 03:27:02,219
'What a thing to say!' Cosette replied.

2767
03:27:02,760 --> 03:27:04,800
'Are you angry with me because I'm happy?'

2768
03:27:05,520 --> 03:27:11,161
'Cosette,' he said, 'your happiness 
is the only thing that matters to me.

2769
03:27:12,180 --> 03:27:15,960
You're happy now, and so my work is complete.'

2770
03:27:17,399 --> 03:27:20,700
With these words, he picked up his hat and left.

2771
03:27:22,859 --> 03:27:25,620
Jean Valjean continued his evening visits,  

2772
03:27:25,620 --> 03:27:30,300
but the relationship between himself and 
Cosette became cooler and more distant.

2773
03:27:31,020 --> 03:27:34,440
She stopped calling him 'father' 
or asking him questions.

2774
03:27:34,439 --> 03:27:39,660
As 'Monsieur Jean', he gradually 
became a different person to her,  

2775
03:27:39,660 --> 03:27:42,840
and she began not to depend 
on him for her happiness.

2776
03:27:44,340 --> 03:27:50,400
Valjean would sit looking at Cosette in silence, 
or would talk about incidents from their past.

2777
03:27:51,720 --> 03:27:54,660
One evening in April, he called at the usual  

2778
03:27:54,660 --> 03:27:58,139
time but was told that Cosette 
had gone out with her husband.

2779
03:27:59,520 --> 03:28:04,201
He waited in the small, damp room for 
an hour before sadly returning home.

2780
03:28:05,220 --> 03:28:11,160
Over the next few days, his visits began to be 
interrupted by servants calling Cosette to dinner.

2781
03:28:12,239 --> 03:28:16,080
When he arrived, he discovered 
that the fire had not been lit,  

2782
03:28:16,080 --> 03:28:18,960
and the armchairs had been left near the door.

2783
03:28:20,040 --> 03:28:25,560
One evening he discovered there were 
no chairs in the room at all - he and  

2784
03:28:25,560 --> 03:28:28,380
Cosette had to stand in the 
cold for their whole meeting.

2785
03:28:29,460 --> 03:28:31,620
Valjean realized what was happening;  

2786
03:28:32,279 --> 03:28:36,000
Marius was telling the servants 
not to make him welcome any more.

2787
03:28:37,380 --> 03:28:42,840
That night he went home in despair, and 
the next evening he did not come at all.

2788
03:28:44,580 --> 03:28:47,340
When Valjean did not appear 
for the second evening,  

2789
03:28:47,340 --> 03:28:51,300
Cosette sent a servant to his 
house to ask if he was well.

2790
03:28:52,380 --> 03:28:57,480
Valjean replied that he was very well, 
but that he had business to attend to.

2791
03:28:58,620 --> 03:29:00,720
He did not return to the house again,  

2792
03:29:00,720 --> 03:29:05,460
and Cosette was too busy with married 
life to think too much about him.

2793
03:29:06,359 --> 03:29:11,279
She did not realize that, every 
evening, Valjean would walk slowly  

2794
03:29:11,279 --> 03:29:15,660
from his house until he reached the 
corner of the street where she lived.

2795
03:29:16,560 --> 03:29:19,680
He would then stare at the 
house for several minutes,  

2796
03:29:19,680 --> 03:29:25,800
tears rolling down his cheeks, before 
turning round and slowly returning home.

2797
03:29:27,319 --> 03:29:28,319
***

2798
03:29:28,319 --> 03:29:32,759
Marius thought it was right to 
exclude Valjean from Cosette's life.

2799
03:29:33,479 --> 03:29:37,439
He achieved this without 
cruelty, but without weakness.

2800
03:29:38,340 --> 03:29:42,960
Apart from the details about his life 
that Valjean had confessed to him,  

2801
03:29:42,960 --> 03:29:47,160
he knew that Valjean had killed 
Inspector Javert at the barricade.

2802
03:29:48,060 --> 03:29:55,140
His private investigations into the old man's past 
had also revealed an even more disgusting fact.

2803
03:29:56,220 --> 03:30:02,940
He had discovered that Valjean's money really 
belonged to somebody called Monsieur Madeleine,  

2804
03:30:03,600 --> 03:30:08,460
a wealthy manufacturer from Montreuil 
who had mysteriously disappeared.

2805
03:30:09,660 --> 03:30:15,420
He persuaded Cosette, therefore, not to use 
any of the money her guardian had given her,  

2806
03:30:16,020 --> 03:30:19,860
and to live on the money that he 
had started to earn as a lawyer.

2807
03:30:21,060 --> 03:30:23,400
Cosette had not been happy about this.

2808
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:26,160
She could not understand why her father,  

2809
03:30:26,160 --> 03:30:29,880
as she still thought of Valjean, 
had stopped visiting her.

2810
03:30:30,540 --> 03:30:32,580
She still loved him in her heart.

2811
03:30:33,239 --> 03:30:35,340
But she loved her husband even more,  

2812
03:30:35,939 --> 03:30:40,739
and she gradually became used to not 
depending on the old man for her happiness.

2813
03:30:42,779 --> 03:30:49,559
One evening a servant brought Marius a letter, 
saying, 'The writer is waiting in the hall.'

2814
03:30:51,359 --> 03:30:54,479
The smell of tobacco and the handwriting on the  

2815
03:30:54,479 --> 03:30:59,519
envelope was so familiar that Marius 
immediately thought of the Jondrettes.

2816
03:31:00,180 --> 03:31:01,680
He read the letter quickly.

2817
03:31:01,680 --> 03:31:06,360
It was signed 'Thenard', and was asking for money.

2818
03:31:07,319 --> 03:31:09,899
Marius could not believe his luck.

2819
03:31:09,899 --> 03:31:14,939
He had tried without success to find the man 
who had saved his father's lite at Waterloo,  

2820
03:31:14,939 --> 03:31:21,179
and now the man had come to him! He immediately 
asked the servant to show the man in.

2821
03:31:22,319 --> 03:31:27,779
However, Marius had a shock when he 
saw the man - he did not recognize  

2822
03:31:27,779 --> 03:31:34,559
him at all! He was an old man with a 
big nose, glasses and neat grey hair.

2823
03:31:35,279 --> 03:31:41,040
He was wearing smart black clothes, and a 
gold watch chain hung from his jacket pocket.

2824
03:31:42,420 --> 03:31:47,520
'What do you want?' Marius asked 
coldly, as the stranger bowed to him.

2825
03:31:48,540 --> 03:31:53,880
The stranger explained in great detail how he used 
to work for the government in foreign countries  

2826
03:31:53,880 --> 03:31:59,400
and that, now he was retired, he wanted to move 
to South America with his wife and daughter.

2827
03:32:00,180 --> 03:32:03,900
Unfortunately, it was a long 
journey, and he needed money.

2828
03:32:05,040 --> 03:32:06,540
'What has that to do with me?'

2829
03:32:07,500 --> 03:32:09,120
'Has M.

2830
03:32:09,120 --> 03:32:11,099
Pontmercy not read my letter?'

2831
03:32:12,239 --> 03:32:18,479
Marius had only read the letter quickly, and could 
not remember the details, so he said, 'Go on.'

2832
03:32:19,500 --> 03:32:23,220
'I have a secret to tell you, M.

2833
03:32:23,220 --> 03:32:25,320
Pontmercy,' the stranger said.

2834
03:32:25,859 --> 03:32:28,139
'I'll tell you the first part for nothing.

2835
03:32:28,739 --> 03:32:30,479
I think you'll be interested;

2836
03:32:31,439 --> 03:32:32,040
'Well?'

2837
03:32:32,760 --> 03:32:38,160
'The man you think is your wife's 
guardian is a murderer and a thief.

2838
03:32:38,160 --> 03:32:41,580
His name is Jean Valjean.'

2839
03:32:42,420 --> 03:32:43,560
'I know that.'

2840
03:32:44,340 --> 03:32:48,300
'Did you know that he spent 
nineteen years in prison?'

2841
03:32:49,140 --> 03:32:50,340
'I know that too.'

2842
03:32:51,239 --> 03:32:56,939
The stranger narrowed his eyes, trying to hide 
his disappointment and anger at Marius's calmness.

2843
03:32:57,720 --> 03:32:59,760
Then he gave a strange smile.

2844
03:33:00,479 --> 03:33:03,540
'I have more information to tell you.

2845
03:33:04,260 --> 03:33:07,920
It concerns money that belongs to your wife.

2846
03:33:08,760 --> 03:33:16,440
It's a remarkable secret and I'll sell 
the information to you for 20,000 francs.'

2847
03:33:17,460 --> 03:33:22,560
'I know this secret already,' Marius 
said, 'just as I knew the others.'

2848
03:33:23,640 --> 03:33:25,920
'10,000 francs?'

2849
03:33:25,920 --> 03:33:28,500
'I repeat, you have nothing to tell me.'

2850
03:33:28,500 --> 03:33:33,899
'But I need to eat, Monsieur!' the 
visitor said, losing confidence.

2851
03:33:33,899 --> 03:33:37,979
'I'll tell you for twenty francs.'

2852
03:33:38,760 --> 03:33:41,400
'I know it already,' Marius said.

2853
03:33:41,399 --> 03:33:42,239
'I know everything.

2854
03:33:42,239 --> 03:33:44,580
I even know your real name.

2855
03:33:45,899 --> 03:33:47,580
It's Thenardier.'

2856
03:33:48,899 --> 03:33:54,420
The visitor laughed, but Marius 
went on, 'You're also Jondrette.

2857
03:33:54,960 --> 03:33:58,020
And you once had an inn in Montfermeil.'

2858
03:33:58,800 --> 03:34:00,420
'I deny it!'

2859
03:34:01,380 --> 03:34:05,640
'You're a completely rotten 
man, but I'll give you this.'

2860
03:34:06,779 --> 03:34:10,920
Marius took a banknote out of his pocket 
and threw it in the stranger's face.

2861
03:34:12,420 --> 03:34:14,819
'Thank you, M.

2862
03:34:14,819 --> 03:34:17,399
Pontmercy!' the man said, examining the note.

2863
03:34:17,399 --> 03:34:20,819
'500 francs! That's real money.

2864
03:34:22,319 --> 03:34:26,639
Oh well, I suppose we can relax.'

2865
03:34:28,080 --> 03:34:34,680
With those words, he removed his 
false nose, glasses and neat grey wig.

2866
03:34:34,680 --> 03:34:34,929
'M.

2867
03:34:34,929 --> 03:34:41,100
Pontmercy is absolutely right,' 
he said, changing his voice.

2868
03:34:41,100 --> 03:34:43,201
'I am Thenardier.'

2869
03:34:44,580 --> 03:34:47,760
He waited for a few seconds 
to see Marius's reaction.

2870
03:34:48,899 --> 03:34:52,979
Marius, meanwhile, was grateful 
for finally having the chance to  

2871
03:34:52,979 --> 03:34:57,059
help Thenardier, and therefore to keep 
the promise he had made to his father.

2872
03:34:58,319 --> 03:35:02,219
Thenardier's presence, however, 
offered him another opportunity;  

2873
03:35:02,220 --> 03:35:06,300
it gave him the chance to solve 
the mystery of Cosette's fortune.

2874
03:35:07,140 --> 03:35:08,940
'Thenardier,' he said.

2875
03:35:09,540 --> 03:35:14,760
'Shall I tell you the secret that 
you were planning to sell me?  

2876
03:35:15,720 --> 03:35:21,240
I, too, have sources of information, and 
probably know more about the subject than you do.

2877
03:35:22,140 --> 03:35:26,400
Jean Valjean, as you say, 
is a murderer and a thief.

2878
03:35:27,120 --> 03:35:33,840
He's a thief because he robbed a wealthy 
manufacturer and mayor of Montreuil, M.

2879
03:35:33,840 --> 03:35:34,260
Madeleine.

2880
03:35:35,279 --> 03:35:41,460
Jean Valjean, who knew the mayor's background, 
reported him to the police and took advantage  

2881
03:35:41,460 --> 03:35:45,840
of his arrest to take over half a 
million francs from his Paris bank.

2882
03:35:46,739 --> 03:35:49,139
The manager of the bank told me this himself.

2883
03:35:50,160 --> 03:35:52,859
And he murdered the policeman, Javert.

2884
03:35:53,520 --> 03:35:56,760
I know this because I was there at the time.'

2885
03:35:58,140 --> 03:36:05,400
Thenardier looked puzzled for a moment, then 
said, 'Monsieur, I think you are mistaken.'

2886
03:36:06,300 --> 03:36:10,380
'What! Are you denying what 
I said? Those are facts!'

2887
03:36:10,920 --> 03:36:16,140
'They are incorrect, and I do not 
like to hear a man unjustly accused.

2888
03:36:16,140 --> 03:36:19,500
Jean Valjean did not rob M.

2889
03:36:19,500 --> 03:36:22,380
Madeleine, nor did he kill Javert.'

2890
03:36:23,520 --> 03:36:24,360
'How do you know?'

2891
03:36:24,960 --> 03:36:27,840
'First, he did not kill M.

2892
03:36:27,840 --> 03:36:30,960
Madeleine because he was M.

2893
03:36:30,960 --> 03:36:36,720
Madeleine! And second, he did not kill 
Javert because Javert killed himself.

2894
03:36:37,380 --> 03:36:40,080
He killed himself by jumping into the river.'

2895
03:36:41,580 --> 03:36:46,920
'What proof do you have?' Marius 
said, wide-eyed with disbelief.

2896
03:36:47,520 --> 03:36:51,541
'I have all the proof here,' Thenardier said,  

2897
03:36:51,540 --> 03:36:56,100
producing an envelope in which there were 
several documents and newspaper articles.

2898
03:36:57,060 --> 03:37:01,260
'I've spent a long time discovering 
the truth about Jean Valjean.'

2899
03:37:02,580 --> 03:37:07,680
Marius studied the documents carefully, 
then looked up with a smile of joy.

2900
03:37:08,580 --> 03:37:14,340
'But he's a splendid man! 
The fortune was really his,  

2901
03:37:15,239 --> 03:37:20,939
and he's not a murderer or thief 
at all! He's a hero and a saint!'

2902
03:37:22,500 --> 03:37:27,180
'He's a thief and a 
murderer,'Thenardier said quietly.

2903
03:37:28,200 --> 03:37:28,979
'What do you mean?'

2904
03:37:30,779 --> 03:37:34,500
'I told you that I do not like 
to see a man accused unjustly,  

2905
03:37:35,160 --> 03:37:39,359
but I do like to see a man punished 
for crimes he has committed.'

2906
03:37:40,620 --> 03:37:42,120
'And what crimes are those?'

2907
03:37:43,500 --> 03:37:47,580
Thenardier sat down and told 
Marius about the time he had  

2908
03:37:47,580 --> 03:37:50,100
helped Valjean to escape from the Paris sewer.

2909
03:37:51,180 --> 03:37:56,340
'He was carrying the body of a man he 
had robbed and killed,' Thenardier said.

2910
03:37:56,340 --> 03:38:00,960
'Look, I have a piece of cloth 
from the dead man's coat as proof.'

2911
03:38:02,160 --> 03:38:05,519
He produced a muddy piece of 
cloth and showed it to Marius,  

2912
03:38:06,180 --> 03:38:10,140
who immediately went pale and 
rose unsteadily to his feet.

2913
03:38:11,220 --> 03:38:17,220
As Thenardier continued to talk, Marius 
opened a cupboard door and took out a coat.

2914
03:38:18,600 --> 03:38:22,201
'That man was me!' Marius cried.

2915
03:38:22,200 --> 03:38:24,359
'And here is the coat I was wearing!'

2916
03:38:26,340 --> 03:38:31,500
Thenardier stared at the coat and the 
cloth in his hands, speechless with fear.

2917
03:38:32,460 --> 03:38:36,000
He was even more surprised when, 
instead of chasing him out of the room,  

2918
03:38:36,540 --> 03:38:42,000
Marius ran towards him and pressed several 
thousand-franc notes into his hand.

2919
03:38:43,380 --> 03:38:46,500
'You're a terrible man,' Marius said.

2920
03:38:46,500 --> 03:38:48,300
'A thief and a liar.

2921
03:38:48,960 --> 03:38:52,500
You came here to destroy a man, 
but you have done the opposite.

2922
03:38:53,100 --> 03:38:58,320
If you hadn't saved my father's life at 
Waterloo, I'd report you to the police.

2923
03:38:59,399 --> 03:39:01,139
I know that your wife is dead,  

2924
03:39:01,859 --> 03:39:06,120
but take the money and start a new 
life in America with your daughter.

2925
03:39:07,260 --> 03:39:11,580
When you arrive there, I'll 
send you another 20,000 francs.

2926
03:39:13,200 --> 03:39:14,220
Now get out.

2927
03:39:14,819 --> 03:39:17,219
I never want to see you again!'

2928
03:39:19,380 --> 03:39:24,180
When Thenardier had left, unable 
to believe his good fortune,  

2929
03:39:24,180 --> 03:39:28,920
Marius ran to find Cosette and 
told her everything immediately.

2930
03:39:30,300 --> 03:39:33,480
'We must go to him at once,' Marius said.

2931
03:39:33,479 --> 03:39:35,519
'He was the man who saved my life.

2932
03:39:35,520 --> 03:39:37,260
We must waste no time!'

2933
03:39:38,760 --> 03:39:45,660
Minutes later, he and Cosette were travelling 
in a carriage to Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme.

2934
03:39:47,180 --> 03:39:48,180
***

2935
03:39:48,180 --> 03:39:55,201
Jean Valjean looked up when he heard the knock on 
his door and called in a weak voice, 'Come in.'

2936
03:39:56,520 --> 03:40:00,420
The door opened and Marius and Cosette appeared.

2937
03:40:01,020 --> 03:40:04,201
Cosette rushed to the chair 
where Jean Valjean was sitting.

2938
03:40:04,200 --> 03:40:08,340
'Father!' she cried, falling into his arms.

2939
03:40:09,239 --> 03:40:16,800
'So you've forgiven me?' Valjean whispered, 
hugging Cosette to him and turning to Marius.

2940
03:40:18,120 --> 03:40:21,059
'Cosette, did you hear what he said?'  

2941
03:40:21,720 --> 03:40:26,340
Marius cried, tears of shame and 
guilt rolling down his cheeks.

2942
03:40:27,180 --> 03:40:29,640
'He asked me to forgive him.

2943
03:40:30,600 --> 03:40:36,000
And do you know what he did? He saved 
my life and he brought me back to you.

2944
03:40:36,600 --> 03:40:40,260
He came to the barricade to save 
me, just as he saved Javert.

2945
03:40:41,279 --> 03:40:45,420
He carried me on his back through the 
sewers of Paris, to bring me to you.

2946
03:40:46,680 --> 03:40:50,340
Oh Cosette, I feel so ashamed 
of the way I've treated him!'

2947
03:40:51,600 --> 03:40:56,820
'You have no need to say 
all this,' Valjean murmured.

2948
03:40:57,540 --> 03:41:01,080
'Why didn't you say it yourself?' Marius demanded.

2949
03:41:01,080 --> 03:41:03,479
'Why didn't you tell me that you were M.

2950
03:41:03,479 --> 03:41:06,299
Madeleine and that you saved Javert's life at the  

2951
03:41:06,300 --> 03:41:10,140
barricade? Why didn't you tell 
me that I owed you my life?'

2952
03:41:11,760 --> 03:41:15,600
'Because I thought it would 
be better to break away.

2953
03:41:16,800 --> 03:41:23,820
If you had known the truth, you would have felt 
obliged to be good to me, a worthless criminal.

2954
03:41:24,420 --> 03:41:26,399
That would have upset everything.'

2955
03:41:27,540 --> 03:41:31,380
'What or whom would it have upset?' Marius said.

2956
03:41:31,380 --> 03:41:34,020
'Well, we're not going to allow 
you to stay here on your own.

2957
03:41:34,620 --> 03:41:36,239
You're going to come home with us.

2958
03:41:37,020 --> 03:41:39,420
You're Cosette's father and mine.

2959
03:41:40,080 --> 03:41:42,420
I won't allow you to spend another day here.'

2960
03:41:44,279 --> 03:41:47,759
'And you can't refuse this time,' Cosette agreed,  

2961
03:41:47,760 --> 03:41:51,239
sitting on Jean Valjean's 
lap and kissing his forehead.

2962
03:41:51,899 --> 03:41:54,120
'There's a carriage waiting for you.

2963
03:41:54,120 --> 03:41:57,300
I'm kidnapping you - by force, if necessary!'

2964
03:41:58,680 --> 03:42:03,540
Jean Valjean listened as she described 
the view from the room that would be his,  

2965
03:42:03,540 --> 03:42:06,840
the beauty of the garden, 
the singing of the birds,  

2966
03:42:07,620 --> 03:42:11,819
but he was listening more to the music of 
her voice than to the meaning of her words.

2967
03:42:12,960 --> 03:42:19,620
Finally, he said, 'Yes, it 
would be delightful, but

2968
03:42:20,640 --> 03:42:24,420
Cosette, frightened, took his two hands in hers.

2969
03:42:25,260 --> 03:42:27,960
'Your hands are so cold,' she said.

2970
03:42:27,960 --> 03:42:30,480
'Are you ill? Are you in pain?'

2971
03:42:31,260 --> 03:42:33,480
'No,' said Valjean.

2972
03:42:34,140 --> 03:42:35,520
'I'm not in pain.

2973
03:42:36,180 --> 03:42:36,780
But

2974
03:42:37,620 --> 03:42:38,460
'But what?'

2975
03:42:39,479 --> 03:42:41,459
'I'm going to die soon.'

2976
03:42:42,779 --> 03:42:45,239
'Father, no!' Cosette cried.

2977
03:42:45,239 --> 03:42:48,300
'You're going to live! You 
must live, do you understand?'

2978
03:42:50,100 --> 03:42:55,201
Marius and Cosette both did their best 
to raise Valjean's spirits, to show him  

2979
03:42:55,200 --> 03:43:00,540
how much they loved and needed him, to fill him 
with the strength and the desire to live again.

2980
03:43:01,680 --> 03:43:02,880
But it was too late.

2981
03:43:02,880 --> 03:43:10,260
Valjean smiled, his eyes shining with love and 
happiness, but he was beginning to lose strength.

2982
03:43:11,279 --> 03:43:15,120
'To die is nothing,' he murmured.

2983
03:43:15,840 --> 03:43:18,900
'But it is terrible not to live.'

2984
03:43:20,279 --> 03:43:27,660
Then, taking Cosette's sleeve and pressing it to 
his lips, he said, 'Come close to me, both of you.

2985
03:43:29,160 --> 03:43:30,779
I love you dearly.

2986
03:43:32,220 --> 03:43:35,220
How sweet it is to die like this.

2987
03:43:36,479 --> 03:43:39,059
And you love me too, dear Cosette.

2988
03:43:40,319 --> 03:43:44,519
You'll feel some grief for me, but not too much.

2989
03:43:45,779 --> 03:43:48,540
I want you to have no great sorrows.

2990
03:43:49,680 --> 03:43:52,201
You must enjoy life, my children.

2991
03:43:53,700 --> 03:43:58,080
I'm leaving the two candlesticks 
by the bed to Cosette.

2992
03:43:59,700 --> 03:44:04,979
They're made of silver, but 
to me they are pure gold.

2993
03:44:06,600 --> 03:44:13,260
I don't know whether the person who gave them to 
me is pleased as he looks down on me from above.

2994
03:44:14,760 --> 03:44:16,020
I've done my best.

2995
03:44:17,460 --> 03:44:25,500
You mustn't forget, my children, that, 
despite my money, I am one of the poor.'

2996
03:44:27,359 --> 03:44:33,179
As he spoke, Valjean's breathing became more 
painful and he had difficulty moving his arms.

2997
03:44:34,080 --> 03:44:39,180
But as the weakness of his body 
increased, his spirit grew in strength.

2998
03:44:39,779 --> 03:44:43,920
The light of an unknown world 
was shining brightly in his eyes.

2999
03:44:45,660 --> 03:44:55,439
'Now, Cosette,' he breathed softly, 'the time 
has come for me to tell you your mother's name.

3000
03:44:56,819 --> 03:44:59,340
It was Fantine.

3001
03:45:00,660 --> 03:45:02,220
You must not forget it.

3002
03:45:03,180 --> 03:45:08,340
Your mother loved you greatly 
and she suffered greatly.

3003
03:45:09,540 --> 03:45:13,260
She was as rich in sorrow as you are in happiness.

3004
03:45:14,460 --> 03:45:17,399
That is how God balances things out.

3005
03:45:18,540 --> 03:45:26,399
He watches us all from above and knows 
what he is doing among his splendid stars.

3006
03:45:27,779 --> 03:45:31,859
And now I must leave you, my children.

3007
03:45:33,600 --> 03:45:36,480
Love one another always.

3008
03:45:38,399 --> 03:45:44,759
There is nothing else that matters 
in this world except love.'

3009
03:45:47,520 --> 03:45:52,860
Cosette and Marius fell to their knees on 
either side of him, holding back their tears.

3010
03:45:54,180 --> 03:45:59,940
Jean Valjean's hands rested on their 
bowed heads, and did not move again.

3011
03:46:01,439 --> 03:46:04,439
He lay back with his head turned to the sky,  

3012
03:46:05,340 --> 03:46:11,742
the light from the two silver candlesticks 
falling on his smiling, peaceful face.
