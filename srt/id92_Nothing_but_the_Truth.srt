CHAPTER ONE
Dawn in Bangkok

2
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:40,830
Hu decided to get up. She couldn't sleep.
The first bird of the Bangkok dawn, the cuckoo,

3
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:51,120
started its noisy, morning cry, 'Gow-wow!
Gow-wow! Get up! Get up!' Hu could hear the

4
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,320
growing noise of the early morning traffic.
It was not yet six o'clock.

5
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:04,519
It was impossible to sleep. She walked over
to her window and opened it. The noise and

6
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:12,600
the smell of the big city washed over her.
It was still dark. It was a cool January morning,

7
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,060
the first day of the spring term.

8
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,680
Hu looked out of the window. The newspaperman
arrived on his motorbike and gave his parcel

9
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,040
of newspapers to the man at the entrance of
the apartment block. The two men laughed,

10
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,229
and then the newspaperman waved and drove
noisily away to the next apartment block in

11
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:42,080
the Soi, the next street. There was light
in the sky now, a soft orange light in the

12
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,479
grey dawn.

13
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,649
It was always difficult to sleep the night
before the new term, but this time it was

14
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:58,290
even harder. Hu was excited. She would see
Marwa and Thomas and Yoshiko again, and that

15
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,229
was exciting. She would do less housework
and more school work, and that was exciting

16
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,439
too.

17
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:15,630
Hu was seventeen and a good student. She studied
at the Bangkok International Academy, an international

18
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,580
school for the children of foreign people
working in Thailand. It was expensive, but

19
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:29,190
the Chinese oil company, where her father
worked, helped her family to pay for her education.

20
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:36,670
She had to study very hard, and all the classes
- except her Thai language class - were in

21
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:44,260
English. Hu loved English. Her father wanted
her to become a doctor. Her mother said she

22
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:50,610
didn't mind what Hu wanted as long as Hu was
happy. But Hu wasn't sure if she wanted to

23
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:57,430
be a doctor, or that she would get good enough
results to go to medical school.

24
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:03,730
Hu liked to work hard, but she was worried
about her studies, about her English exam.

25
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:10,660
Today Mr Stanyer, her English teacher, would
give out the results of last term's English

26
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:18,260
test. Hu knew she had problems with her English,
but she didn't know what the problems were.

27
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:25,740
She loved English - or she had loved English
until she started with Mr Stanyer last term

28
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,840
- and she thought she was good at English.
Her classmates thought she was good at English

29
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,210
too. She helped Marwa with her English homework
sometimes, but then Marwa got better results

30
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:44,060
than Hu. Better results with her work!

31
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:51,470
Hu didn't understand. Mr Stanyer seemed to
like her, he always smiled at her. But at

32
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:58,630
the end of last term, after the test, he had
asked her to stay after class.

33
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:06,510
'Come here and sit down,' Mr Stanyer said.
Hu sat at his desk in the empty classroom,

34
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,750
facing her teacher.

35
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,530
'How was the test, Hu Jian Ming?' asked Mr
Stanyer.

36
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,120
'OK, Mr Stanyer. I think I did quite well,'
said Hu.

37
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:28,320
'I hope so. Your father has great hopes for
you. He works for an oil company, doesn't

38
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,740
he?' Mr Stanyer smiled and looked Hu in the
eye.

39
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:40,340
'He's an engineer with a Chinese oil company.'
Hu felt uncomfortable.

40
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:47,720
'He wants you to take the International Baccalaureate,
the IB, doesn't he?' Mr Stanyer continued

41
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
with questions.

42
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:57,140
'Well, you must get better results next term.
This is just a test, but next term we have

43
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:05,490
the real exam. Then we decide if you can start
the IB programme,' said Mr Stanyer.

44
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:13,880
'Yes, Mr Stanyer.' She noticed Mr Stanyer
was sweating, although the classroom was cool.

45
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,850
Mr Stanyer smiled and put his hands on his
bald head. 'Perhaps you should do some extra

46
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:26,100
work on your English. Think about it over
the holiday.'

47
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:35,900
'Oh!' said Hu. Her cat, Lao Mao, had jumped
suddenly into her room through the open window,

48
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:46,470
surprising her. 'Stupid cat!' said Hu as she
picked up Lao Mao. Hu loved animals, she loved

49
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:54,130
nature. Her home city, Wu Xi, was in beautiful
countryside, with lakes and low hills in the

50
00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:00,891
distance. When Hu's family had to leave China
and come to Thailand so that Hu's father could

51
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:06,990
work for his oil company in Bangkok, her mother
and father allowed her to bring one thing

52
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:14,810
to remind her of home. Hu chose to bring Lao
Mao. Hu liked to talk to him when she was

53
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:22,440
sad, or worried, or feeling a long way from
home. Very quietly, she explained her problems

54
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,400
with her results for her English studies to
the cat.

55
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:37,010
'If I fail my English test, what can I do?'
whispered Hu. Lao Mao said nothing. The noisy

56
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:44,530
cuckoo sang back across the waking city: ' Gow-wow!
Gow-wow!'

57
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,340
Hu looked over the apartment blocks to the
raised motorway carrying traffic over the

58
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:57,480
city, and the private gardens of the few remaining
houses. Bangkok. She missed her own country

59
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:04,060
very much. The sun was rising over the block
opposite hers like a big, wet, orange ball.

60
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:11,940
A man in yellow clothes, a Buddhist monk,
was walking up the road asking for food. A

61
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:19,170
big Mercedes car came round to the front gate.
'Probably a businessman going to the airport,'

62
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,320
thought Hu.

63
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,200
Hu yawned. What would she do?

64
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,900
Something caught her eye in the Soi below.
A very large orange and black animal, a squirrel,

65
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,260
was running along an electricity line over
the Soi. Electricity lines ran across the

66
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:46,020
Soi in a hundred different directions, meeting
at the posts at the sides of the street in

67
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:53,610
big balls. Hu thought these balls of electricity
lines looked like spaghetti. The squirrels

68
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,230
used the electricity lines like motorways,
running to and from whatever important business

69
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:06,040
squirrels have to do. Hu looked towards the
raised motorway in the distance. All the cars

70
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,430
were stopped even now, at half past six in
the morning. Another Bangkok traffic jam.

71
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:19,060
Hu's eyes followed the racing squirrel along
the line and down into another garden.

72
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,720
There was a knock at the door.

73
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,979
'Jian Ming! Come on, my love. It's a school
day today.'

74
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:36,680
That was her father. He was usually out of
bed first. He worked very hard.

75
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,490
'I'm out of bed, father. I'm coming. Don't
worry.'

76
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:49,680
'Don't worry,' thought Hu. 'My father mustn't
worry,' she told Lao Mao, her cat. 'He works

77
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,730
too hard.'

78
00:08:50,730 --> 00:09:00,080
Lao Mao said nothing. He didn't care.

79
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,379
CHAPTER TWO
New term, old friends

80
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:14,089
Hu walked up the narrow Soi to school. She
felt happy and excited. The early morning

81
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:23,470
sun was bright. It almost hurt her eyes. It
was cool and the skies were blue and clear.

82
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:29,629
There were street restaurants, which had small
tables and tiny plastic chairs on the pavements.

83
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:36,230
Hu stepped into the road as she walked past
them. City workers sat and ate bowls of Khao

84
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:42,839
Chom, a thick rice soup. They wore their office
clothes, and they ate quickly, talking and

85
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:49,119
laughing at the same time. The shop opposite
the school was full of students from the international

86
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:56,619
school in their blue uniforms. They were buying
drinks and snacks. Some of them had spent

87
00:09:56,619 --> 00:10:02,110
two hours or more fighting their way through
the Bangkok traffic jams to get to school.

88
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:09,420
There was a loud noise as a boat raced down
the long, the canal at the end of the Soi.

89
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:16,070
Water flew into the air. The smell of the
dirty water made Hu feel sick for a moment.

90
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:24,259
'Everybody is trying to get to work or to
school. Everyone is busy, hurrying,' thought

91
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:27,910
Hu. It filled her with excitement.

92
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,980
She walked past the building workers' dark,
small homes. They were building another expensive

93
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,369
apartment building for rich people to live
in, but the building workers lived in their

94
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:46,040
own tiny, dark city. They had built their
small world on some waste ground between two

95
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:53,300
tall new buildings, the Royal Luxury Tower
and Executive Mansion Apartments. Their homes

96
00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:00,720
were made out of old sheets of metal, pieces
of wood and useful bits of rubbish. Babies

97
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:08,330
were crying, women were washing clothes, themselves,
and children. Hu could see a television, men

98
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:14,860
playing cards, chickens looking for food in
the dirt and a small dog asleep in the middle

99
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,910
of all the noise. Women and men were walking
in silence from their crowded homes to their

100
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:27,800
work. Hu tried to look into their sad, dark
eyes. They would breathe and eat the dirt

101
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,850
all the long working day, and often late into
the night. Hu tried to smile at them but they

102
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,100
didn't smile back.

103
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,360
It was wonderful for Hu to see her friends
again. They crowded together at the entrance

104
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,589
to the school. They were all trying to tell
the others what they had been doing during

105
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:56,589
the holidays at once. Thomas Kuhlauf had been
home to Germany for Christmas. He had a special

106
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:04,290
German cake, called a stolen. He gave Hu and
Marwa and Yoshiko a piece each while they

107
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,890
waited for the bell for the beginning of school.

108
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:14,800
They were still eating Thomas' wonderful cake
as they went into the school hall.

109
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,360
Hu found herself sitting next to a new student.
He was tall and had blond hair. He had a friendly

110
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,189
face, with quick eyes and a ready smile.

111
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:35,480
'Hi! I'm John Truman from the USA. This is
my first day here. What's your name?' said

112
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:43,720
the stranger, smiling. He very politely offered
Hu his hand. Hu was surprised, but she smiled

113
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,899
and shook his hand.

114
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:51,739
'I'm Hu. From China... Hu Jian Ming. Your
first day?'

115
00:12:51,739 --> 00:13:01,529
'Shhhh!' said Marwa, who was sitting on her
other side. 'Mr Grisman! Mustn't talk!'

116
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:06,879
The school principal, Mr Grisman, walked on
to the stage and raised his hands to tell

117
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:15,050
the whole school to be quiet and listen. He
was tall and had grey hair. He was wearing

118
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:22,879
dark clothes and a very serious expression.
Hu thought he looked silly. He stared at them

119
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,309
importantly until there was silence, and then
he smiled and said:

120
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:36,160
'Welcome! Welcome! Happy New Year! And welcome
to a new year at the Bangkok International

121
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Academy...'

122
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:45,000
'It's not my New Year yet, it's not the Chinese
New Year until next month. It's not the Thai

123
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,300
New Year until April. It's not Marwa's or
Yoshiko's either,' thought Hu. She stopped

124
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,839
listening.

125
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,059
She looked at the teachers sitting behind
Mr Grisman on the stage. Mr Stanyer, her English

126
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:08,429
teacher, was yawning. He was very sun-tanned.
Mr Riding, the school counsellor, looked like

127
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:14,389
a sleeping animal, until his eyes suddenly
opened and slowly stared around the hall.

128
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:20,630
Mrs Patel, the music teacher, was looking
very pleased with life. She was wearing a

129
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:29,209
lovely new sari, her traditional Indian dress.
Where was Dr Nyondo, the head of Upper School?

130
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:39,079
There was a new woman. She was tall and about
forty years old. She sat very straight. She

131
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,279
had blond hair and a kind, intelligent face.

132
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:49,759
'... And as Dr Nyondo has left us to take
up the position of principal of a high school

133
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:57,069
in Australia, it is my pleasure...' Mr Grisman
looked round at the woman who stood up. '... My

134
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:04,620
great pleasure to introduce Mrs Verity Truman
as the new head of Upper School.'

135
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,750
'That's my mother!' said John.

136
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,899
'Shhh!' said Marwa. 'Mustn't talk!'

137
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:19,209
But they did, as quietly as they could. Hu
and John made friends while his mother made

138
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,110
a short speech.

139
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:30,399
John was from Chicago, Illinois. He had one
sister, Mary, who was in the fifth year. His

140
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,660
father was a lawyer with a multinational company.
John's father was now working in the Bangkok

141
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,439
headquarters of his company, and working very
long hours.

142
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:48,639
'My father's like that!' said Hu. 'I don't
see much of him. I go to bed before he comes

143
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,009
home in the evening. We don't have much time
to talk even in the mornings.'

144
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:58,029
'What does he do?' asked John.

145
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:03,999
Hu told him that her father worked as an engineer
for a Chinese oil company, managing the company's

146
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:11,149
Bangkok office and projects in Eastern Thailand.
And that her mother looked after small children

147
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:17,959
at a kindergarten in the mornings and sometimes
did baby-sitting at night. She told him that

148
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:25,980
she had a pet cat called Lao Mao and that
she liked music... and all kinds of things.

149
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:32,399
Mr Grisman was still talking. He invited Mrs
Patel to talk to the school about the new

150
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:39,549
school show. It was a musical called 'The
Wizard of Oz'. Mrs Patel was going to hold

151
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:42,119
auditions on Friday after school.

152
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:48,730
'What does "auditions" mean?' whispered Hu
to John.

153
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,980
'You have to try out acting and singing in
front of the people organising the show. If

154
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:00,129
you're good, they give you a part. Do you
sing, Hu?' asked John.

155
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:06,660
Hu was excited. 'I love singing. I can act
too. I...'

156
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:19,370
'Shhh!' said Marwa. Mrs Patel looked angrily
at Hu and John. Hu's face went red with embarrassment.

157
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:25,400
The first day passed happily and quickly.
Hu was happy to be back among her friends

158
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,230
and studying again after the holidays.

159
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:36,669
As Hu went into her last class, a Thai language
class, her Thai teacher, Khun Naraporn, handed

160
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:43,909
her a note. It was from Mr Stanyer, her English
teacher. It read:

161
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:50,669
Please see me after class today. I want to
discuss your English results with you.

162
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,240
D. S.

163
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,940
Marwa watched her read the note.

164
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,860
'Are you OK?' Marwa asked.

165
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,460
Hu passed her the note.

166
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:09,679
'Miss Hu! Please pay attention! Today we are
going to study the traditions of the Thai

167
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,740
New Year,' said Khun Naraporn.

168
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:23,720
'Oh dear!' thought Hu. She was very worried.
She was sure the note was bad news. What was

169
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:33,970
Mr Stanyer going to say? She tried to concentrate
on her Thai lesson.

170
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,529
CHAPTER THREE

171
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:36,780
Sharing troubles

172
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,900
'But, Mr Stanyer? Forty-six per cent?'

173
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:49,150
'It's not good, Hu. It's not good.' Mr Stanyer
was shaking his head.

174
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,659
'But, really, I...' Hu was close to tears.

175
00:18:53,659 --> 00:19:00,899
'Listen!' said Mr Stanyer, leaning forward
across the desk. His big red face was close

176
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:06,840
to Hu's. He picked up Hu's writing test. 'Here's
your work!'

177
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,600
He threw it across the desk at Hu. Hu thought
this was very rude. As she collected the papers

178
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,700
together, she knew her feelings would show
in her face. She had worked hard on the essay

179
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,970
and now it was covered in red ink.

180
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:33,789
'OK, Hu,' said Mr Stanyer. He smiled. Hu didn't
like his smile. He tried to laugh and leant

181
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:40,750
back in his chair and put his hands on his
baldhead. The classroom was air- conditioned,

182
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:48,350
almost too cool, but there were dark marks
under his arms. 'You're a good kid, a bright

183
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,070
kid. Your father wants you to be a doctor,
right?'

184
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,669
'Yes, but...' Hu said.

185
00:19:54,669 --> 00:20:01,970
'Yes, but!' Mr Stanyer moved forward suddenly
hitting his hands on the desk between them.

186
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:10,750
'YES BUT!' he repeated in a loud voice to
scare her. Then he remembered to smile. 'But

187
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:18,470
your results have got to improve. It's only
six weeks until the exams for the IB, the

188
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:25,240
International Baccalaureate programme. Forty-six
per cent is a fail. You can't be a doctor

189
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,720
unless you get the IB.'

190
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,690
He could see Hu was going to cry. He pushed
his chair back and stood up. He took a handkerchief

191
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:43,169
from his pocket and wiped his forehead. He
tried a new voice, a voice like a child asking

192
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:44,169
their mother for a sweet.

193
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:55,380
'Hu, we can work on this. Together.' Mr Stanyer
walked round the desk and slowly sat down

194
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:03,460
in the chair next to Hu. He smelled of sweat.
He put his arm on the back of Hu's chair.

195
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:11,350
Hu sat as far forward as she could and looked
at the desk. She was trying not to cry, trying

196
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,830
not to smell Mr Stanyer's fat smell.

197
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:25,549
'It's a question of work. You're intelligent.'
Hu looked at the desk. 'You work hard, Chinese

198
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:34,820
people work hard,' said Mr Stanyer, laughing.
'Maybe I can help you, Hu?'

199
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:41,130
Hu tried to look at him. He was smiling his
biggest, his most sugary smile.

200
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:49,639
'You need some extra lessons. Private lessons.
One-to-one. After class. We can work on this

201
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:52,120
exam preparation together.'

202
00:21:52,120 --> 00:22:01,440
'You would give me lessons?' asked Hu. Mr
Stanyer stood up and walked back to his own

203
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
seat opposite her.

204
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,750
'Sure. Well, not exactly give you lessons.
I mean, you'd have to pay.'

205
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:16,780
'I don't have any money, Mr Stanyer. How can
I pay?' asked Hu.

206
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:22,210
'Hey! Your father's an oil engineer. You should
talk to him!'

207
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:31,919
'But I can't tell...' Hu started to say, but
she stopped. Now she stood up. She was very

208
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,039
angry. She looked down at Mr Stanyer.

209
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,410
'I shall have to discuss this with my father.'
She walked to the door without looking back.

210
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:48,960
'Sure!' Mr Stanyer called after her. 'Talk
to your father. But Hu, those results have

211
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,049
got to improve!'

212
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:57,789
Hu didn't start crying until she was outside
the classroom.

213
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:05,549
There is a small wooden house in a banyan
tree in the south corner of the school playing

214
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:13,029
field, near the klong. The klong smell is
very bad there, but after school it is a place

215
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,909
you can sit alone.

216
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:21,470
Hu climbed in and threw herself into a broken
car seat. She put her head in her hands and

217
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:26,039
cried. She couldn't go home like this.

218
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:32,860
Her father wanted her to be a doctor. And
now she was getting bad results. Hu's shoulders

219
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,210
shook as she cried.

220
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:43,080
But she still didn't understand. All her other
results were good or very good. In music and

221
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:50,220
in drama she was, her teachers said, a 'star'.
She dried her eyes.

222
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,450
Hu looked up. A face appeared in the entrance
to the tree house.

223
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:03,450
'Can I come in?' said the face. It was her
new friend, John Truman. As he said this,

224
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,750
another face appeared. It was a small blond
girl.

225
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,490
'This is my sister, Mary,' John said.

226
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,230
'Hi!' said Mary as the two pulled themselves
into the tree house.

227
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:23,740
'This is Hu Jian Ming, Mary. And she doesn't
look very happy,' John said.

228
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:31,259
'Hi Mary! Hi John!' Hu tried to look happy.
'What are you doing here?'

229
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:36,040
'Waiting for mother,' said Mary. 'She's at
a teachers' meeting.'

230
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:42,330
'What's that?' asked John, pointing at Hu's
hand.

231
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:49,759
Hu had not realised. Her English essay was
now a small ball in her hand. She was so angry.

232
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,429
She threw the essay to John.

233
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:54,039
John opened it out.

234
00:24:54,039 --> 00:25:01,830
'That,' said Hu, 'is my English essay. My
rubbish essay. My forty-six per cent essay.

235
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:08,700
My failed essay. My...' She stopped because
she thought she was going to cry again.

236
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,190
John tried to read the essay.

237
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:19,380
'Hey, this is good,' said John. 'But Eve never
seen so much red ink.'

238
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:27,389
John read from the essay: '"Wu Xi, My Home
Town. The beautiful sailing boats, their red

239
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:34,200
sails full, moved slowly over the mirror-like
surface of the lakes." Wow! You can write!

240
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,149
Is this where you live?'

241
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:45,330
'My father was working in Beijing before we
came here. But I was born in Wu Xi. It is

242
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:50,601
my home. My grandmother still lives there,
and my mother's family. At our new year, we

243
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:52,780
used to go there...'

244
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:59,720
'"The friendly hills gather round the metal-smooth
lakes as the skies turn pink,"' John read.

245
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,120
'This is good! When can I go there?'

246
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,520
'My teacher doesn't like it,' said Hu, sadly.

247
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:18,080
'"Did..." I can't read his writing... "you
copy this from a guide book?" Huh. I don't

248
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,010
think this guy likes you, Hu.'

249
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:27,010
'I don't know. He's always looking at me in
class.' Hu was confused.

250
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,360
John laughed and then looked serious.

251
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:37,120
'Forty-six per cent isn't very good. I hope
this wasn't a test or something.'

252
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,480
John still had half a bottle of water he had
bought at the Chinese shop opposite the school

253
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:48,580
gates, and Hu had some of her morning snack
left. The three of them had a little picnic.

254
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:54,659
Hu made John and Mary promise not to tell
anybody else, and then she explained her problems

255
00:26:54,659 --> 00:27:00,149
to them.

256
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:05,049
CHAPTER FOUR
To be a star

257
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:11,120
The noise in the school restaurant was very
loud. Three hundred students were all shouting

258
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:18,000
at once. Three hundred metal trays banged
upon the tables, and all the metal forks and

259
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,399
spoons and knives banged together at the same
time.

260
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:29,530
'A normal day at the BIA,' shouted Hu as she
sat down with Marwa, Yoshiko, Thomas and John.

261
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:38,649
'What's this?' shouted Thomas, pointing with
his fork at a small pool of wet brown stuff.

262
00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:44,710
'Food, Mr Kuhlauf, but not as we know it!'
said John.

263
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:51,889
They all laughed except Marwa. She had her
own food from home. Her mother had prepared

264
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:58,259
a rice dish for her. It smelled delicious,
and Marwa ate quickly and in silence.

265
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:04,280
'Are you going to the meeting after school?'
asked Thomas. 'It's for the school show, "The

266
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
Wizard of Oz".'

267
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,289
'Yes, I'm going,' said Hu.

268
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:15,720
'That awful Melanie Gibson wants to be the
star,' said Thomas. 'You know her, she's got

269
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,340
long red hair and she sings like a duck! Quack,
quack!' he shouted.

270
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:29,630
'You are unkind, Thomas!' Hu said. 'It's true
about her singing though.' She tried to look

271
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,630
cross.

272
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,789
'And Sean Payne wants to be the Wizard,' Thomas
continued.

273
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:42,370
'Sean Payne? The one who wasn't allowed to
come to school for a while?' asked Yoshiko.

274
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:49,080
Sean Payne was always in trouble. Once he
let out the air of the tyres on the principal's

275
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,529
car. Mr Grisman sent him home and would not
let him come back to the school for two weeks.

276
00:28:54,529 --> 00:29:01,519
'That's him. The ugly one with hair like a
brush. The one whose father runs a bar. He

277
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,320
married one of his dancers, did you know?'
said Thomas.

278
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:13,799
'Thomas Kuhlauf, you talk too much!' said
Hu crossly. This time she was really angry.

279
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:19,049
Thomas carried on talking about people who
wanted to be in the school show. Hu decided

280
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:22,029
not to listen any more.

281
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:28,419
John asked as quietly as he could. 'Did you
talk to your father about extra English lessons?'

282
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:37,150
'I can't talk here. It's too noisy. Come to
the library.'

283
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:43,851
Hu often went to the library at lunchtime
and after school. It was cool. Hu loved to

284
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:50,190
read, and the librarian, Miss Paula, helped
her find new and interesting books.

285
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:58,809
John and Hu found a desk in a corner and talked
quietly. Miss Paula let them talk, pretending

286
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:05,999
not to notice. Hu was her favourite student.
Hu read more than any other student in the

287
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:13,039
school and often stayed after school to help
her. Miss Paula was pleased to see Hu talking

288
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,830
to such a good-looking boy. She noticed Hu
was looking worried.

289
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:27,730
'No, I didn't talk to my father. I didn't
see him last night or this morning. An important

290
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,070
businessman is coming to Bangkok tonight,
and my father must prepare for the visit.

291
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,070
But...'

292
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,070
'Yes?' said John.

293
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:43,419
'But I don't want to talk to him about it.
He worries too much. If he knows about my

294
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:50,519
bad results, he'll be angry. He'll worry about
it. And Mr Stanyer wants me to pay for the

295
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:57,820
lessons. My father is not a rich man. I don't
know what to do,' Hu explained.

296
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:05,000
'I've been thinking. Maybe I can help. You
show me some more of your work and we can

297
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,720
look at it together.'

298
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,889
'But John, that's too kind.'

299
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:18,690
'Not at all,' said John, smiling. 'Let's do
a deal. I have to start Thai lessons, and

300
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,539
you already speak Thai...'

301
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:23,499
'I'm not very good,' said Hu.

302
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:30,100
'Better than me!' said John. 'I'm a complete
beginner. I have to wait after school with

303
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:36,710
Mary until my mother has finished. We can
study together in here some days.'

304
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:43,610
Hu thought for a moment. Most afternoons her
mother was out doing small jobs to earn some

305
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:50,389
extra money. Hu didn't like to return to the
empty flat. And she needed help. John was

306
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:51,389
very kind.

307
00:31:51,389 --> 00:32:00,450
'OK, that's a good idea. Not today, though,
there's the meeting about the show. And tomorrow

308
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:07,450
Mr Stanyer wants me to have my first private
lesson. But we can start next week.'

309
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:13,639
'That's agreed then,' said John. 'Oh, and
give me your phone number. Then if I have

310
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:18,879
a problem with my homework, I can ring and
ask you for help. Or you can ring and ask

311
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:26,860
me. Mine's 250 1972. What's yours?'

312
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:35,830
'255 1970,' replied Hu without thinking. She
felt her face going red. 'But don't phone

313
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:42,169
too late, my parents... I mean, I go to bed
very early.'

314
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:49,210
Mrs Patel and John's mother, Mrs Truman, stood
on the stage in the main hall with three other

315
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,279
teachers.

316
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:58,419
'Sean? If you would be so good as to stop
talking...' Mrs Patel began.

317
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:03,809
'Hi!' shouted Sean, with a silly look on his
face.

318
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:11,500
'For the new students, my name is Mrs Patel,
and I am pleased to welcome you all. So many

319
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:17,919
people want to join the show! If we cannot
give you a singing part, there are many other

320
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,830
jobs... Mrs Truman' - Mrs Patel gestured to
Mrs Truman, who smiled - 'will explain that

321
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:32,950
in a moment. My job is to be musical director.
I will train you to sing and, I hope, to act

322
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:39,600
the parts. Mrs Truman will be the producer.
Mrs Truman will explain what she is going

323
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,850
to be doing, and then I will tell you about
how we will choose the actors.'

324
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:50,990
There were more than thirty students there.
Thomas Kuhlauf was very excited, he couldn't

325
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:57,999
keep still. Sean was already talking again.
Melanie Gibson was brushing her beautiful

326
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:04,059
red hair. She had changed out of her school
uniform and was now wearing a pretty pink

327
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:11,530
dress. 'Quack, quack,' thought Hu. Then she
felt guilty.

328
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:16,659
Mrs Truman explained the job of the producer
and all the jobs there were for people who

329
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:26,030
were not singing and acting in the show. 'Making
clothes, lighting, painting things, moving

330
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:32,440
things, organising, publicity, tickets...'
John knew he couldn't sing or act, but he

331
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:39,160
loved painting and organising. He would, he
decided, do one of these jobs.

332
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:48,410
Later they divided into groups. They had two
exercises, one singing and one acting exercise.

333
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:56,440
Hu sat and read the song through. It was easy.
She loved to sing. When she was not busy,

334
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:03,530
Hu's mother would teach her to sing. Hu's
mother had studied opera before she married.

335
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:09,230
When she was happy, Hu's mother would sing
as she did the housework. That was not very

336
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,230
often.

337
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:20,010
The singing went well. Hu sang simply while
Mrs Patel played the piano. Some of the other

338
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:26,440
students clapped their hands at the end. John
and Thomas clapped hard. Hu was surprised

339
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:33,080
when she saw Sean Payne clapping too, and
smiling at her stupidly.

340
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:40,270
She was even more surprised when she had to
act with Sean. Sean loved to make people laugh,

341
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:46,120
and he didn't care if he looked stupid. Often
he didn't know when to stop trying to make

342
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:53,610
people laugh, but this time everything went
well. He had learned his words and he didn't

343
00:35:53,610 --> 00:36:02,390
change anything. He made the other students
laugh, and even Mrs Patel and Mrs Truman smiled.

344
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:08,040
Hu felt wonderful. Maybe Sean Payne was not
so stupid all the time.

345
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:16,000
'We think we can decide who will get the major
parts straight away,' said Mrs Patel. 'So,

346
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,140
I will read a list of people I want to stay
behind at five o'clock. The rest of you can

347
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,910
come back, please, next Thursday.'

348
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:33,131
Mrs Patel read out Hu's name. Hu was delighted.
She was in the show! And so was Thomas, and

349
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:41,150
Melanie Gibson and ('I don't believe it!'
said Hu to John.), Sean Payne.

350
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:45,000
It was hard to wait to talk to Mrs Patel,
Hu was so excited.

351
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,260
'You can have the part of Dorothy,' said Mrs
Patel when it was Hu's turn.

352
00:36:52,260 --> 00:37:00,230
'But? But, Dorothy's an American farm girl.
I don't look right. I don't look like an American

353
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:08,420
girl. I don't speak like an American. Melanie
looks more like Dorothy... I...'

354
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:15,270
'Please, Hu!' said Mrs Patel, laughing. 'You
sing beautifully. And American girls look

355
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,950
just like you and me.'

356
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:25,570
Mrs Patel put her head back and laughed. 'I
mean like me when I was your age. American

357
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:32,790
girls are all different colours and shapes
and sizes and... and you can sing and you

358
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,050
can act.'

359
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,930
'My mother helped me learn to sing, she studied
opera,' Hu said.

360
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:47,340
'That explains it. And you act very simply
and very well. Melanie...' Mrs Patel paused.

361
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,140
She was searching for words.

362
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,530
'Melanie sings like a duck,' thought Hu, but
she didn't say anything.

363
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:02,180
'I think Melanie can be your understudy,'
said Mrs Patel, at last.

364
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,100
'Understudy?' Hu didn't understand.

365
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:12,120
'Yes, someone who can take your place if you
are ill. We call this person an "understudy".

366
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:18,360
She will learn your part. If, for some reason,
you cannot be in the show, she can be Dorothy.'

367
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,420
Mrs Patel looked at Hu, waiting for her reply.

368
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:29,580
Hu felt unhappy. 'And if I am in the show?
If I play Dorothy?'

369
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:38,110
'There are plenty of other parts for Melanie.
Will you take the part?'

370
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:44,860
Hu waited a few minutes after her talk with
Mrs Patel. She waited to know which part Thomas

371
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,200
had got. Sean waited with her.

372
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:55,151
As Melanie left the main hall, she turned
suddenly and looked Hu in the eyes. Melanie

373
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:59,650
had clearly been crying. Her face was white
with anger.

374
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:10,260
'You! Dorothy!' Melanie laughed. She laughed
too loud. 'Hu Jian Ming, I know what you're

375
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:19,300
doing! Just you wait! You'll see! I'll get
you!' she was shouting, almost screaming.

376
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:26,570
'Cool!' said Sean, smiling stupidly.

377
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:31,370
CHAPTER FIVE
Money worries

378
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:38,610
Hu was sitting on the balcony of her apartment.
It was evening. She had Lao Mao, the cat,

379
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:46,660
sitting on her knee, but otherwise she was
alone. The balcony was full of plants in pots.

380
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:53,920
Her mother loved plants, and filled the apartment
and the balcony with growing things. The balcony

381
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,700
was so full of plants it was difficult to
move. In the family, they called the balcony

382
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:07,140
'Mother's little jungle'. Hu's father liked
to water the plants in the early morning before

383
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,920
he went to work. He said it helped him relax.

384
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:21,400
'Stupid!' said Hu to the cat. Lao Mao said
nothing. Hu thought the cat smiled.

385
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,870
Hu was worrying about money.

386
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:32,810
'Lao Mao, you are lazy, and you don't listen
to me. Sit on your own chair!' Hu put the

387
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,830
cat on another plastic chair and stood up.

388
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:43,610
She went to the edge of the balcony and looked
across at Bangkok. Bangkok was coming home

389
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:51,130
from work. Bangkok was trying to come home.
Hu could see the traffic standing still on

390
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:57,550
the highway. There was the smell of the traffic,
a smell of cooking, a smell of dirt, and a

391
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:02,610
smell of plants from the balcony and from
the gardens in the Soi below.

392
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:11,880
'Stupid!' said Hu again, returning to her
chair. How could she pay for her extra English

393
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:19,290
lessons? She didn't get a lot of pocket money.
Her father was generous but he had said:

394
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:25,500
'Hu, we have been saving for when you to go
to medical school for a long time...'

395
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:33,090
'When?' Hu had thought. 'If not when I go.'
But she had said nothing.

396
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:42,240
'There will be other expenses,' her father
had continued. 'You must save too.'

397
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,240
Mr Stanyer had said he would want the money
after each lesson, twice a week. Without good

398
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,270
results in English, she could not enter the
IB programme. Without the IB, medical school

399
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,890
was a dream.

400
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:05,080
It was very quiet in the apartment. Hu's mother
was baby-sitting. Hu's mother did small jobs

401
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,630
for people, for neighbours in the apartment
block and for friends.

402
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:18,670
Hu's father was a good man, but he didn't
understand. He didn't want his wife to work,

403
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:25,640
but he didn't understand how expensive life
was in central Bangkok. The oil company gave

404
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:31,530
them a big apartment because he often had
to entertain important people from work. But

405
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,960
he wasn't a rich man.

406
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:42,350
Once Hu had offered to do work for money.
The answer was no. Her mother was shocked.

407
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:49,720
'Your education is more important,' she had
said. 'One day you will be a doctor. Then

408
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:56,620
you will have money. Concentrate on your studies
and your father will be proud of you. Your

409
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,640
father cannot let you work...'

410
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:07,301
The doorbell rang, waking Hu from her thoughts.
Hu answered it. Marwa stood at the door with

411
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:12,570
a pile of English books in one hand, a plastic
box in the other, and a big smile.

412
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,850
'Can I come in?' said Marwa.

413
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:24,180
'Of course,' said Hu. 'My father's still at
work and my mother's baby-sitting.'

414
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:29,530
It was getting dark in the big empty apartment,
so Hu switched the lights on and cleared the

415
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:34,160
dining table. Marwa put the books and the
box on the table.

416
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:42,880
'We've got sweets and we've got English homework!'
she said. 'Which do you want first?'

417
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:51,950
'Sweets!' said Hu. Mrs Marlati, Marwa's mother,
was famous for her homemade Iranian sweets.

418
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:58,270
The two friends sat eating sweets and began
the homework. Hu thought the homework was

419
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:02,630
easy, but explaining the answers to Marwa
made it more interesting.

420
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:13,530
'Your father always works late,' said Marwa
through a mouth full of sweets, 'like my father.'

421
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:20,770
Hu sighed. 'Yes, he works late. Tonight he
must meet an important businessman from the

422
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:26,820
airport. He won't be home before midnight.'
She took another sweet and turned the page

423
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:33,970
of the textbook. 'He works too hard, smokes
too much and worries too much.'

424
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:36,780
'My father's the same,' said Marwa.

425
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:44,040
'I only see him in the morning before school.
Even at the weekends, he must play golf with

426
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:50,290
important customers. In the morning, he wakes
me up coughing. He's always tired.'

427
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:57,920
But he's an oil engineer. Very important.
Very rich!' said Marwa.

428
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,530
Hu thought of her mother's little jobs. 'He's
an engineer and he manages the Bangkok office.

429
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:14,070
It's a good job but... But I wish he didn't
work so hard... Mr Stanyer wants us to do

430
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:18,220
up to exercise 3, modal verbs.'

431
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:24,320
Hu tried to explain modal verbs to Marwa.
They talked about their families and ate too

432
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,030
many sweets.

433
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:33,150
Just before half past nine, the doorbell and
the telephone rang at the same time. Marwa's

434
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:41,070
driver was at the door. He had come to take
her home. Hu waved goodbye to Marwa and went

435
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,260
to the telephone.

436
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,980
'Hu, sorry. Is it too late? John Truman here.'

437
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,550
'Oh,' said Hu.

438
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:55,880
'Yeah, good news. They will tell you at school
tomorrow. We're going on a field trip to Khao

439
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,940
Yai National Park.'

440
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:04,110
'Khao Yai? We? You mean all of year eleven?'
asked Hu.

441
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:12,740
'Sure. Well, if you want to. It's a geography
and biology field trip. Listen: "The oldest

442
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:18,990
and largest of Thailand's national parks...,"
sorry I'm reading, "... two hundred and fifty

443
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:25,240
wild elephants, twenty-five to thirty tigers,
eight hundred species of orchids..."'

444
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:34,920
'That sounds wonderful. But when? How many
days? Will it be expensive?' Hu was excited,

445
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,420
but she was thinking of money and all the
little jobs her mother had to do. She loved

446
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:47,090
animals, flowers and trees. And it would be
good to get away from Bangkok. Away from the

447
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:52,830
dirt and the traffic noise, the smells and
the hurrying crowds. They never went away

448
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:57,020
at the weekend, her father was always too
busy or resting.

449
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:05,290
'Let's see. Five days, Monday to Friday, first
week in March, before the heat gets too bad.

450
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,290
Listen...?'

451
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:13,560
'Sorry, John. Sounds great, but I must go!'
said Hu and she quickly put the phone down.

452
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:19,870
Her mother was home. 'Who was that?' she asked
quickly.

453
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:27,760
'John, John Truman,' Hu replied. 'A student
from school. An American boy.' Hu's face was

454
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,440
going red.

455
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,280
'And what was it about?' her mother asked.

456
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:40,020
'Oh, nothing. Homework. He wanted to know
about, er, geography homework.' Hu didn't

457
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,220
like to lie.

458
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:48,940
'At half past nine in the evening? Do you
have time to talk to "American boys" all night?

459
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:54,660
You must study in the evenings if you want
to be a doctor. Have you done the washing

460
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,660
up?'

461
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:00,500
Hu quietly went to the kitchen. She did not
want to tell her mother about the field trip

462
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:08,360
to Khao Yai National Park. She was thinking
about how much money the field trip would

463
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,210
cost.

464
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:16,060
CHAPTER SIX
Lessons in disappointment

465
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:21,930
All the year eleven students met in the video
room at lunchtime the next day. It was hard

466
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:28,750
to get a seat and some of the taller students
had to stand at the back. Mr Rodriguez gave

467
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:34,580
out some information explaining the field
trip and the kinds of activities the students

468
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,200
would have to do.

469
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:42,750
Hu looked through the information until she
found the part on cost: including everything,

470
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:51,870
it was six thousand Baht. Hu laughed sadly,
shaking her head. In a low voice she said,

471
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,830
'Stupid!'

472
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:59,280
Mr Rodriguez suddenly stopped speaking. With
all the students in the video room, it was

473
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,720
getting very hot.

474
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:07,590
'I'm sorry, Miss Hu, did you have something
to tell us?' he asked, drying his big black

475
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:09,560
moustache with a handkerchief.

476
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:18,790
'No... I... sorry, Mr Rodriguez.' Hu felt
embarrassed. Sean Payne laughed at the back.

477
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:28,280
'May I continue then?' Hu nodded, her face
red with embarrassment. 'Thank you, Miss Hu.

478
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,150
Where was I? Yes...'

479
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:37,360
Hu was adding up the cost in her head. It
was almost Chinese New Year, an expensive

480
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:44,250
time for Chinese families. All the presents,
all the food. Hu knew her family couldn't

481
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:49,880
afford to go home to China for the holiday
this year even if Hu's father was not too

482
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:56,030
busy. She had heard her parents arguing about
it late one night the week before. There was

483
00:49:56,030 --> 00:50:01,200
no way her father could pay for her to go
on the field trip.

484
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:08,690
Then Mr Rodriguez put the lights out and switched
on the video. Hu thought it was wonderful.

485
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:16,020
The jungle and the mountains, the cool waterfalls,
the many colours of the birds. Hu forgot she

486
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,460
was at school.

487
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:24,010
'Hrrrmmph!' Sean Payne was being an elephant.

488
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:30,090
Mr Rodriguez stopped the video and switched
all the lights on. Sean was standing using

489
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:35,260
his arm as the elephant's trunk, while the
boys next to him were laughing.

490
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:44,520
'Get out, Sean!' shouted Mr Rodriguez. 'You
can come and see me at half past three.' Mr

491
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:49,970
Rodriguez touched his moustache with his handkerchief
and said something quietly in Spanish. Some

492
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:58,730
of the students at the back of the classroom
clapped their hands as Sean left the room.

493
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:04,970
Hu found Mr Stanyer's classroom empty when
she went there at half past three that afternoon.

494
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:10,650
She waited outside for nearly fifteen minutes
until Mr Stanyer came and opened the door.

495
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:18,760
His body touched hers as he pushed past her.
He smelled of sweat and tobacco smoke.

496
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:25,700
'Sorry Hu, I'm a bit late. Had to go to the
teachers' room...' He sat down heavily and

497
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:32,910
opened his desk, taking out a can of cola
and some textbooks. He pushed his desk back

498
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:38,750
and put his feet on the desk. He yawned and
turned the pages of the textbook.

499
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,790
'So you spoke to your father, Hu?'

500
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:49,640
'Mr Stanyer, I don't want my father to know
about these lessons. He worries about my results.

501
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:56,280
I don't want him to worry. If my results improve,
there won't be a problem.'

502
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:03,390
Mr Stanyer smiled slowly, his hands on his
bald head. He laughed quietly and smiled.

503
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:13,940
'That's fine, Hu. This can be our little secret.
Our little secret.' Then he laughed again.

504
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:24,060
'OK,' he said. 'Let's do something on tenses.
Things you usually do in the past. Page 14,

505
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:31,030
exercise 3a.' Mr Stanyer handed Hu an old
copy of the students' workbook that went with

506
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:33,540
their textbook.

507
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:40,500
Then he settled down with a magazine. Hu couldn't
see the magazine, but Mr Stanyer gave it all

508
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:46,380
his attention, smiling and laughing as he
turned the pages. He seemed not to know Hu

509
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:49,090
was in the classroom.

510
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:56,270
Hu worked through the exercises. At first
they seemed easy. But then she wanted to ask

511
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,860
a question.

512
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,450
'Mr Stanyer?'

513
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:02,880
'Mmm.' His eyes didn't leave the magazine.

514
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,920
'Is "used to" a tense?'

515
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:14,950
'Is "used to" a tense?' Mr Stanyer mocked
Hu's voice. 'The answers are at the back of

516
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,390
the book, Hu.'

517
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:22,940
'Yes, and I've got the answers right. All
right. But it doesn't seem like a tense. It

518
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,070
doesn't change and...'

519
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:31,990
'So you want to be the expert now?' Mr Stanyer
looked in the drawer in his desk. He pulled

520
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:36,390
out a grammar book and threw it on the desk
in front of Hu.

521
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:44,290
'Yeah, it's a kind of tense, er, in the past.
Look it up.' He pushed his chair back and

522
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:50,340
slowly stood up. 'Listen, I've got to make
a phone call... I'm going to the teachers'

523
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:57,320
room. I'll be back in five minutes, maybe
ten.' He carefully put the magazine back in

524
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:01,550
the drawer, locked the desk and left the room.

525
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:06,980
He didn't go to the teachers' room. Hu saw
him walking through the school gate and across

526
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:11,080
the road to the Chinese shop.

527
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:18,650
Hu looked up 'used to' in the grammar book.
The explanation didn't help her. She started

528
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,130
the next exercise.

529
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:27,490
It was nearly half past four when Mr Stanyer
came back. His face was red and he smelled

530
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:32,270
more strongly of cigarettes, and, she guessed,
rice whisky.

531
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,570
'Any problems?'

532
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:42,960
'No, I got all the answers right. But I still
don't understand if "used to" is a tense or...'

533
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,090
'Let's just call it an expression. Listen,
honey, sometimes we just say things a certain

534
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:54,850
way in English.' Mr Stanyer yawned. Hu said
nothing.

535
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:59,380
'OK, we've done enough for today,' said Mr
Stanyer.

536
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,210
'We?' thought Hu.

537
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:07,530
'So... er, that's five hundred Baht. That's
what we agreed?'

538
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:13,900
Hu didn't argue. That's what Mr Stanyer had
agreed, with himself. With all the pocket

539
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:19,920
money she had saved and her lunch money for
the last two days, Hu had exactly five hundred

540
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,920
Baht.

541
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:28,750
'See you on Wednesday,' said Mr Stanyer, counting
the hundred Baht notes and smiling to himself.

542
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:37,100
But how would she find the money for Wednesday?
How would she stand six more weeks with Mr

543
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:41,310
Declan Stanyer?

544
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:46,570
CHAPTER SEVEN
Of rings and lies

545
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:52,790
The two policemen entered the classroom during
her English lesson. One was fat, his stomach

546
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:58,550
tight in his brown uniform, the other was
small and thin. They had guns.

547
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:05,800
'We have come for Hu Jian Ming. She must come
now. She stole a gold ring.'

548
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:11,480
Before Hu could say anything, the small policeman
roughly took her by the arm and pulled her

549
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:16,050
towards the classroom door. Marwa started
crying.

550
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:17,690
'Huuuu...'

551
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:23,580
Hu started to try and speak. 'You must tell
my father...' But the words wouldn't come

552
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:32,260
out. She couldn't breathe. What was happening?
Mr Stanyer started laughing. The other children

553
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:38,170
started laughing. The thin policeman was pulling
her through the classroom door. Marwa was

554
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:44,760
screaming. Hu couldn't breathe. 'You must
tell my father...'

555
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:53,680
She was awake, breathing heavily, her heart
beating fast. It was quite dark. Bangkok was

556
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:59,540
very strange at four o'clock in the morning
because it was so quiet. From time to time,

557
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:04,530
there was the noise of a motorbike, but even
the building work had stopped until first

558
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:05,970
light. Where was she?

559
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:17,030
'I am in my own bed. I am at home. There are
no policemen. I did not steal the ring.' Hu

560
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:26,530
tried to calm herself. Slowly her breathing
and her heart returned to normal. It was a

561
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,530
dream.

562
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:35,550
Of course! The ring! Aunty Wang's ring. Aunty
Wang was Hu's mother's cousin. The ring had

563
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:41,730
belonged to Aunty Wang's mother before she
died. When Aunty Wang went to live in America

564
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:45,190
with her new husband, she had given the ring
to Hu.

565
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:52,510
'My husband is a rich man. I will have all
the rings and all the gold I want,' she had

566
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,510
told Hu.

567
00:57:53,510 --> 00:58:01,440
The ring was very old and very valuable. Hu
kept it in a jewellery box her mother had

568
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,300
given her on her sixteenth birthday.

569
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:12,150
'I can sell it,' Hu told herself. 'Later I
can work and buy another one just like it.

570
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:15,400
It will just be like borrowing the money.'

571
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:22,050
Hu decided she would carefully write down
the dates and the amounts she paid to Mr Stanyer

572
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:29,990
after each 'lesson'. She would only spend
what she needed to. She felt very bad about

573
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:35,560
the idea, but she couldn't see any other way
out of her situation. It was a long time before

574
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,630
she slept again.

575
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:45,870
It was Saturday. Hu had told her mother she
was going to the Dusit zoo with Marwa and

576
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:53,120
Yoshiko. Hu's father was playing golf with
his important visitor that day. Her mother

577
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:58,480
was finishing a dress for the English woman
in the apartment above theirs. Hu was alone

578
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:04,990
in the apartment. She made herself a snack
to eat and then started across Bangkok.

579
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:12,120
It is always easy to find a jewellery shop
in Bangkok, but Hu didn't want to be recognised,

580
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:18,620
so she travelled to the other side of the
city. The bus journey was long and hot and

581
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:25,900
uncomfortable - even on a Saturday, the traffic
was very bad. But she had a seat, and she

582
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:32,330
sat holding tight to the gold ring in its
box, with a mixture of fear and guilt.

583
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:38,320
She tried three jewellery shops before she
could get a good price. In the third shop,

584
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:46,420
there was an old Chinese man with two gold
teeth. Hu could argue better in her own language.

585
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:53,920
The man didn't seem to believe that the ring
belonged to Hu, but she managed to raise the

586
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,620
price. Finally, the man said that she was
robbing a poor old man and disappeared into

587
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:06,830
the back of the dark shop. He came back with
lots of five hundred Baht notes. He counted

588
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:14,240
out the sum they had agreed and gave the notes
to Hu. Now she felt like a thief.

589
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:21,130
Hu buried the notes right at the bottom of
her shoulder bag and walked out into the sunshine.

590
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:27,870
Hu couldn't go home so soon. She sat at a
tiny table on the pavement and ordered a bowl

591
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:35,230
of noodles. They were hot and delicious. But
she couldn't eat them. She thought of the

592
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:41,840
money in the bag at her feet and felt sick
with fear. Bangkok is a safe enough city if

593
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:48,240
you are careful, but Hu had never had so much
money before. And it didn't feel like her

594
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,250
own money.

595
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:56,940
After a while, it was time to go home. She
would tell her mother she didn't feel well

596
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,470
and had to come back from the zoo early.

597
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:10,430
Another lie, but now she had the money for
her lessons.

598
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:11,810
CHAPTER EIGHT

599
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:15,210
A proud father

600
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:20,980
The next few weeks were a little easier. Hu
couldn't stop feeling guilty about selling

601
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:28,490
her gold ring, and worried about the money
hidden in her jewellery box. She still slept

602
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:36,250
badly. She spent as little of the money as
she could and wrote down each amount she 'borrowed'.

603
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:41,780
Hu tried to keep the lessons secret, but her
friends soon learnt about her situation. They

604
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:45,380
were very good to her.

605
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:52,310
Lessons! They were not real lessons. Hu learnt
to do the simple exercises Mr Stanyer gave

606
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:57,470
her from the workbook at the beginning of
the lesson, and then when he went to 'make

607
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:05,460
a telephone call', she would do her other
homework. She didn't ask questions. 'That's

608
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:12,490
just how we say things in English,' Mr Stanyer
would say. How she hated that!

609
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:20,150
And how she hated him, his smell of sweat
and cigarettes, his laziness. She hated the

610
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:26,210
way he laughed at his magazines, how he sat
with his feet on the desk. But he was too

611
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:32,010
stupid to worry about. And now that she was
paying for lessons, he was giving her higher

612
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:34,360
marks.

613
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:41,580
One day he looked up from his magazine and
found Hu yawning and stretching. She was bored,

614
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,040
and she had not slept well.

615
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:51,000
'You uncomfortable?' he said. 'These classroom
chairs are uncomfortable. And it's kind of

616
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:59,910
hot in here.' As usual, there were dark marks
under the arms of his shirt. Mr Stanyer pushed

617
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:06,410
his hands across his baldhead. He took a deep
breath, smiled, and then said:

618
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:14,270
'Hu, we don't have to be uncomfortable. We
don't have to have these lessons here. You

619
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:21,160
could come back to my place in Soi 35. You
could relax there... be more comfortable.'

620
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:29,490
'No!' said Hu, looking Mr Stanyer directly
in the eye. She said no with such strength,

621
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:34,820
with so much anger, Mr Stanyer looked as if
she had hit him.

622
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:41,830
Then he went to make a telephone call. He
never mentioned the idea again.

623
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:47,870
Hu learnt much more English in the library
with John than with Mr Stanyer. John told

624
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:55,880
her about his home in America, about his friends
and his family. Hu told him about China, about

625
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:02,590
the many changes in her life and the lives
of her friends and family. They talked about

626
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:09,870
Thailand, and of their hopes for their future
lives. John wanted to be an engineer; Hu was

627
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:15,090
not sure if she wanted to be a doctor or a
singer.

628
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:22,030
The school show was the best, the most exciting
part of her life at school. She knew her father

629
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:28,670
would not be happy about her taking part in
the show. 'Your studies must come first. You

630
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:34,950
won't become a doctor by singing in shows,'
he would say. But when she told her mother,

631
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:40,990
her mother was delighted and helped her learn
the songs. When she was not doing one of her

632
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:46,890
little jobs, baby-sitting or making clothes,
Hu's mother came to watch them practising.

633
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:53,140
She found the music and the style of singing
very different from her own training, but

634
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:59,590
it made her happy and excited. Afterwards,
Hu would hear her mother singing as she prepared

635
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:06,930
their supper. Sometimes Hu's mother would
sing her favourite love songs from Anhui opera,

636
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:11,540
and sometimes she would try the songs from
'The Wizard of Oz' in her strange Chinese

637
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:16,240
English. It made Hu laugh.

638
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:22,160
As she had expected, Hu's father was not very
happy about the school show, but he was glad

639
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:28,410
to see Hu's mother enjoying herself. He pointed
out that Hu needed all her spare time for

640
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:35,720
studying, but left the decision to her. After
a while, he said nothing. Perhaps he was too

641
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,570
busy and too tired to argue.

642
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:46,270
All the talk among her friends was about the
field trip to Khao Yai. They talked about

643
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:52,940
which groups they would join and which activities
they would do together. Hu didn't like to

644
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:58,090
feel jealous. She had told Mr Rodriguez she
couldn't go because she had to prepare for

645
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:05,461
the Chinese New Year holiday. Mr Rodriguez
was disappointed. Hu was his star pupil in

646
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:11,550
biology. Hu said nothing when her friends
were making their plans. She told herself

647
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:18,280
it was more important to prepare for the selection
tests for the IB. The tests were a week after

648
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,880
the field trip.

649
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:26,480
One morning, a week before the field trip,
Hu was woken up by the sound of her father

650
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:33,280
coughing. He was on the balcony outside her
room, watering mother's 'little jungle'. A

651
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,730
few seconds later, he knocked on her bedroom
door.

652
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:40,920
'Jian Ming, I want to talk to you.'

653
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:46,910
It sounded important. Hu put on her dressing
gown over her pyjamas and joined her father

654
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:50,470
at the breakfast table. Her mother was in
the kitchen.

655
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:56,180
'Father, you're smoking! It's not even seven
o'clock!' said Hu.

656
01:06:56,180 --> 01:07:06,910
'Oh. Sorry.' He put out his cigarette. 'Important
meeting today. Sorry.' He held up some papers.

657
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:08,590
'What's this?'

658
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:12,770
Hu could see that it was the information about
the Khao Yai field trip.

659
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:18,270
'Your mother was looking in your school bag
for your dirty sports shirt,' he added.

660
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:20,670
'I'm sorry, father.'

661
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:29,120
'And she found this. Why didn't you tell us
about this?' Hu's father looked disappointed.

662
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:38,140
'I'm sorry. I... I forgot. It's not important.
I don't want to go.' Hu couldn't look at her

663
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:39,140
father.

664
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:46,850
He lit another cigarette without thinking.
Hu said nothing. Her father smoked the cigarette

665
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:48,510
and then asked her:

666
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:55,750
'Which is it? You forgot? You thought it wasn't
important? Or you don't want to go?'

667
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,700
'But father, it's so expensive...'

668
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:06,880
'But Jian Ming, it's so important. It's biology.
If you want to be a doctor, you must be good

669
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:13,040
at biology. There is always money for your
education. And I know how much you love plants

670
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:20,810
and birds and animals. You need a break from
Bangkok.' He sighed. 'I know I'm always too

671
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:26,660
busy to give us a holiday, I'm sorry. My work
is so important.'

672
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:30,620
'It's too late now. I've told them I cannot
go.'

673
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:38,429
'You told them you had to prepare for the
Chinese New Year holiday. You know that's

674
01:08:38,429 --> 01:08:39,470
not true.' Her father looked hurt.

675
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:43,569
'You've spoken to Mr Rodriguez?' asked Hu.

676
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:52,020
'I have. And it's not too late. Another student
had to drop out. He has to go into hospital

677
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,310
for a small operation.'

678
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:59,510
Hu's father stood up, checking his jacket
pockets for cigarettes.

679
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:06,630
'It's all arranged. All paid for. You silly
girl.' He laughed and started coughing. As

680
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:14,500
he got to the door of the apartment, he shouted
goodbye to Hu and her mother, and then left.

681
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:26,900
Hu didn't know if she should cry or shout
for joy. Khao Yai National Park! Next week!

682
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:32,000
CHAPTER NINE
Losing the right path

683
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,960
Hu sat with her feet in the water. It was
hot, but she didn't feel too hot with her

684
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:43,529
feet in the water. The others were on the
other side of the pool formed by the waterfall.

685
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:51,210
They were feeding the last of the bread to
some grey fish. What were these fish? Hu wondered.

686
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:57,150
They could ask Mr Rodriguez when they returned
to the Field Centre.

687
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:03,150
It was a moment to herself. It was the first
moment to herself for three days, since she

688
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:05,990
left Bangkok.

689
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:12,980
Hu sat on the warm rock and put her head back.
She looked up through the trees, up and up

690
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:18,750
until maybe a hundred metres above her, she
could see bright blue sky among the leaves

691
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:26,290
and branches. Around her, she could hear water
crashing into the pool and her friends laughing

692
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:33,750
as the fish fought and jumped for pieces of
bread. From the trees came the sound of birdsong,

693
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:41,800
and always, never stopping, the continuous
noise of unseen insects. Up here, about one

694
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:47,430
thousand metres above sea level in the Dongrak
mountains, the air was clean and smelled of

695
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:52,250
plants and flowers; Hu could taste its freshness.

696
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:59,120
Her new happiness had been growing since she
left Bangkok. As they had passed Don Muang

697
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:03,620
International Airport and the last of the
traffic jams, Hu had turned in her seat at

698
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:09,820
the back of the tour bus and looked back.
She could see the milky orange cloud of dirt

699
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:15,490
hanging above the tall buildings of the great
city. She could still see the cloud fifty,

700
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:19,480
even eighty kilometres away.

701
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:25,330
The Thai students had started singing just
beyond the airport. They sang one of Hu's

702
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:32,020
favourite pop songs, 'Mae Ben Rae', which
means 'never mind'. It was perfect for her

703
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:38,490
mood. Mae Ben Rae, never mind money, never
mind Mr Stanyer, the IB tests.

704
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:46,580
As the Thai students sang, the other students
had joined in. Soon the students in the school

705
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:51,650
show were singing some of the songs from 'The
Wizard of Oz'. Hu was asked to sing some of

706
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:58,460
the show's big hit songs and Hu gave her very
best performance. They had sung all the way

707
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:02,800
to the national park's Field Centre where
they were staying.

708
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:10,480
Over the next two days, Hu had had very little
time to herself. Mr Rodriguez kept them busy

709
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:16,400
all day collecting, drawing maps, looking
at different plants and animals and trying

710
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:24,400
to name them. After supper, the teachers gave
them lectures on the park. The days were long

711
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:30,680
and tiring, and Hu slept better than she had
for weeks.

712
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:36,740
Now Hu could hear that Sean Payne had joined
their group by the waterfall. It seemed that

713
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:42,840
every time Hu looked round he was next to
her. He was too friendly. He wanted to give

714
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:49,650
her things, a cola, chewing gum, even a cigarette.
(He was always smoking when the teachers were

715
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:56,630
not looking.) Marwa and Yoshiko were very
good. They knew she didn't want to be alone

716
01:12:56,630 --> 01:13:02,270
with Sean and stayed close to her when Sean
tried to talk to her. She didn't want to be

717
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:09,080
unkind, but she wanted some time to herself.
Or she wanted time to talk to Marwa or John

718
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:14,780
by herself. But Sean was always there.

719
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:19,320
Hu closed her eyes and listened to the music
of the waterfall, and smelled the perfume

720
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,980
of the air. But where was Sean now?

721
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:31,390
Suddenly there was a scream. It was Sean's
voice. Hu opened her eyes and for a moment

722
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:38,640
was blind in the brilliant sunshine. 'Stupid!'
she said to herself. Another scream, Sean's,

723
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,380
came from the trees behind her.

724
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:48,563
'Help! Please help me! I've broken my leg!'
Sean was screaming in English and Thai.

725
01:13:48,563 --> 01:13:54,960
'Sean's in trouble,' said John. 'We've got
to do something!'

726
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,890
'He probably just wants us to go and look
for him,' said Hu.

727
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:00,890
Another scream.

728
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:05,881
'Over there,' said Thomas, pointing to the
trees behind Hu. 'We must go and look. We

729
01:14:05,881 --> 01:14:07,500
must stay together.'

730
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:15,010
'He's probably just being silly,' said Hu,
putting on her walking boots.

731
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:21,650
Another scream. Thomas ran towards the noise.
The others followed him. When they left the

732
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:29,380
path, walking was difficult. Sean was somewhere
up ahead. Then the noise stopped. It was cool

733
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:35,460
by the waterfall, but as soon as they started
into the trees, it was hot. The plants scratched

734
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:42,160
them and Yoshiko was frightened of snakes.
They came to an open space among the trees,

735
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,430
and stopped to wait for Marwa.

736
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:46,240
'He's stopped screaming. We must find him!'
said Thomas.

737
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:53,070
'He was here. I can smell cigarettes,' Hu
said.

738
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:56,810
'He's just playing games with us,' said Yoshiko.

739
01:14:56,810 --> 01:15:05,170
There was a louder scream. 'Help me! I'm dying!'
The screaming seemed very close.

740
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:11,620
'This way!' shouted Thomas, and he started
back into the trees. The others followed.

741
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:13,810
They crossed a stream.

742
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:19,020
Marwa found it difficult, but John helped
her. They heard Sean calling close by.

743
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:26,980
They came to another space. Sean was not there.
His calls had stopped for a moment.

744
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:31,340
'This is stupid,' said Hu. 'It's just a game
for him.'

745
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,400
'I guess...' John began.

746
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,760
'Snake!' screamed Sean.

747
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,520
Thomas was running. The others followed.

748
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:46,900
The search continued for almost an hour. They
crossed streams, climbed higher and higher.

749
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:56,750
'Stop!' said Hu. 'This is stupid. Look!' She
bent down and picked up an empty cigarette

750
01:15:56,750 --> 01:16:01,580
packet. 'This is just a stupid game.'

751
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:07,420
They waited a few moments. John passed round
his water bottle. Nobody spoke.

752
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:16,070
'Roaaaarrrgh!' A horrible noise came from
behind them. 'Don't you know they have tigers

753
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:22,790
here?' said Sean, standing up from behind
a bush. He had a can of cola in one hand and

754
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:25,310
a cigarette in the other.

755
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:32,760
Sean had not broken his leg. He was smiling.
A moment passed. Thomas spoke first.

756
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,330
'You're an idiot!'

757
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:38,630
Sean said nothing. Then John spoke.

758
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:43,640
'I think we're lost!'

759
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:48,870
CHAPTER TEN
Towards the truth

760
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:56,710
They looked at each other in silence. Quietly
Marwa began to cry. Sean looked as if he was

761
01:16:56,710 --> 01:17:02,450
going to say something, but Thomas gave him
such an angry look he changed his mind. Sean

762
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:04,780
began to look in his bag for something.

763
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:12,230
'What are we going to do?' asked Yoshiko.
She had her arm round Marwa to comfort her.

764
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:15,420
'We must think,' said Thomas.

765
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:20,120
'I can phone,' said Sean holding up his mobile
phone.

766
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:26,600
'Yes, but first we have to have some idea
where we are,' said John. 'We need something

767
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,520
we can tell them to look for.'

768
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:33,440
'We can only be about an hour's walk from
the waterfall,' said Thomas.

769
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:40,690
'But which direction?' asked Hu. 'We changed
direction so many times.'

770
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:44,400
'Sorry,' said Sean. Nobody said anything.

771
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:50,890
'We could climb to the top of the mountain
and look around?' offered Yoshiko after a

772
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:51,890
minute.

773
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:58,650
'No. You would just see trees. The answer
must be down, not up. We have been going up

774
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:04,350
all day, following the waterfalls. The last
one is at nine hundred and seventy metres,

775
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:09,470
and we're higher than that,' said John. 'We'll
find the road again if we travel downwards.'

776
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:15,380
'Yeah, you're right,' said Thomas. 'And the
main road through the park is west of the

777
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:21,150
waterfalls. The Pak Chong to Prachinburi road
more or less cuts the park in half from north

778
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:26,460
to south. Were in the eastern half. So we
must walk west and downwards.'

779
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:32,870
'Don't worry, Marwa,' said Hu. 'We'll find
the path.'

780
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:39,440
'No!' said Thomas. Sean had a can of cola
in his hand, ready to open it. 'No! Sean,

781
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,650
we must save water.'

782
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:47,040
'This is cola, Thomas...' said Sean with a
silly smile.

783
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,510
'Don't drink it now, stupid!' shouted Thomas.

784
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:54,590
'OK,' said Sean. He put the can back in his
bag.

785
01:18:54,590 --> 01:19:01,980
'West is this way, I think,' said Hu. She
was pointing at a thick wall of trees. 'We

786
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:04,570
might have to go round those trees.'

787
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:11,090
'Follow me!' said Thomas. 'John, you must
stay at the back with Marwa. And Sean, you

788
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:17,940
mustn't play any more stupid games.' They
set out behind Thomas. Sean pretended to walk

789
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:28,100
like a soldier, quietly saying, 'must, mustn't,
must, mustn't' with each step.

790
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:33,890
It is impossible to walk in a straight line
in thickly forested hill country. Progress

791
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:40,610
was slow and painful. They often had to stop
and sometimes the boys would argue about which

792
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:47,630
way was west. Sean and Thomas argued more
and more through the afternoon, and Marwa

793
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:49,690
looked very tired and frightened.

794
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:56,630
They stopped by a stream. The boys were washing
the dirt and blood from their arms while the

795
01:19:56,630 --> 01:20:00,710
girls tried to decide which way to try next.

796
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:06,500
Hu looked at Sean. 'Do you want to make that
phone call now, Sean?'

797
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:09,060
None of them knew the phone number of the
Field Centre.

798
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:16,670
'I'll phone my mother at work,' suggested
Sean. Thomas raised his eyebrows and was about

799
01:20:16,670 --> 01:20:23,130
to say something, but Hu was standing next
to him and stepped hard on his foot. Thomas

800
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:25,110
said nothing.

801
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:31,400
They waited in total silence as Sean rang.
They all felt happy when someone answered

802
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:37,250
it. Sean turned his back to them while he
talked very quickly in Thai. Then he started

803
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:42,880
shaking the phone. He tried to phone again.
They were all looking at him.

804
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:49,310
'I think the phone is dead. I was talking
to my mother last night for maybe half an

805
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:50,310
hour.'

806
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:54,320
'Did you tell your mother what's happened?'
asked John.

807
01:20:54,320 --> 01:21:00,739
'Yeah,' said Sean sadly. 'But I don't think
she believed me. I think she thought I was

808
01:21:00,739 --> 01:21:03,140
making up stories...'

809
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:09,520
Thomas said something in German. To his surprise,
Sean said something back at him in German.

810
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,680
For a moment, Thomas didn't know what to say.

811
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:19,680
'You guys!' shouted John. 'That's enough!
We've got to think about stopping. We won't

812
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,230
get any further today.'

813
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:27,090
'Yes!' said Thomas. 'First we must find a
place. Then we must share some food and water.

814
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,890
We must make a fire.'

815
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:35,239
'Must, must, always must! Who makes you the
boss? Just because your father's a policeman,'

816
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:38,390
shouted Sean.

817
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:43,450
Thomas was much shorter than Sean, but that
didn't stop him. He threw himself at Sean.

818
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:50,110
Sean easily held him off. Thomas was kicking
and shouting in German.

819
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:55,490
'My father is Chief Police Officer at the
German Embassy,' shouted Thomas breathing

820
01:21:55,490 --> 01:22:02,000
heavily. 'At least he's not a barman. And
he didn't marry a "dancer" from a bar!'

821
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Sean's face went white. He held Thomas very
tightly by the arms, and lifted him off the

822
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
ground.

823
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:16,320
'Listen, Kuhlauf,' said Sean in a low, angry
voice. 'My father owns a chain of restaurants

824
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:25,070
in Bangkok, Hua Hin and Rayong.' Sean was
breathing very heavily. Thomas was suddenly

825
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:30,230
very frightened. 'My mother owned and managed
one of the restaurants when my father bought

826
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:34,750
it. Now she's company accountant.'

827
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:41,480
Sean put his face very close to Thomas' face
and said slowly and angrily, 'Don't you ever

828
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,090
repeat that rubbish again!'

829
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:51,840
There was a moment of total silence. Suddenly
he dropped Thomas. John quickly held Thomas

830
01:22:51,840 --> 01:23:01,200
from behind. Sean and Thomas were both breathing
heavily, staring at each other angrily.

831
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:07,730
Hu, Marwa and Yoshiko took charge. They decided
to stay where they were, close to water to

832
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:14,530
wash in and with a few metres space before
the trees closed in. They went to look for

833
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:20,940
wood, Thomas and John in one direction, Hu
and Sean in the other direction. Yoshiko stayed

834
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:26,360
with Marwa who was very tired and frightened.
The two of them tried to clear some space

835
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,370
to sit and sleep in.

836
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:36,120
Men always like making a fire. The three boys
worked hard collecting wood and leaves. They

837
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:41,350
carefully built the fire and Sean encouraged
a small flame from his cigarette lighter to

838
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:48,340
catch the dry leaves. As darkness closed in,
they started sharing out what little food

839
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:55,400
they had. It was clear that Sean and Thomas
had cooled their anger. John tried to persuade

840
01:23:55,400 --> 01:24:02,280
Thomas to apologise to Sean, but Thomas was
too angry or embarrassed. But they did sit

841
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:07,270
and share a few biscuits and sweets peacefully.

842
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:12,690
Hu found Sean sitting next to her. John was
sitting next to Thomas, as far away from Sean

843
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:19,440
as possible, and Marwa was asleep with her
head on Hu's knee. Sean started chatting to

844
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,710
Yoshiko in Japanese.

845
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:30,350
'How many languages do you speak, Sean?' asked
Hu. 'English from my father, Thai from my

846
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:37,360
mother,' then in Chinese he said, 'I learnt
Chinese from my mother's mother. I also know

847
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:42,490
some Japanese and German from the tourists
when I help in one of my father's restaurants

848
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:46,940
in the school holidays. I like languages.'

849
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:54,770
Yoshiko and Hu were surprised. Hu said so
in Chinese and Yoshiko in Japanese. Sean smiled

850
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:56,900
a kind smile.

851
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:03,520
'Maybe I'm not as stupid as I look.' He was
looking at Hu. She could see his eyes shining

852
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:09,690
in the light of the fire. 'Maybe you shouldn't
listen to what people say about me. I don't

853
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:13,680
believe what they are saying about you, Hu.'

854
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:19,850
Hu sat up quickly. 'And what are they saying
about me?' she said angrily.

855
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:24,620
'That you're one of Mr Stanyer's little friends.'

856
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:33,160
Hu was silent a moment. Sean Payne! He always
said the most stupid things. She almost shouted,

857
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,030
'Who says? Who says that?'

858
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:44,630
'Sorry, Hu, it's true. People are saying it.
Don't be angry. It's rubbish,' said Yoshiko.

859
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:48,550
Hu was frightened, angry. 'They say??'

860
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:55,930
'Mostly your understudy, Melanie Gibson, the
singing duck. You should be careful of her,

861
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:58,870
Hu. She has a nasty way of talking about people.'

862
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:06,920
'Just you wait! You'll see! I'll get you!'
Hu could hear Melanie's words ringing in her

863
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:15,080
head. Hu tried to sleep, but she was thinking,
thinking all the time. Marwa's head was heavy

864
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:19,380
on her knees. Hu couldn't feel her legs.

865
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:25,190
How long before her parents might hear something
about Mr Stanyer and the English lessons?

866
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:33,120
Hu looked into the dark. How long?

867
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:37,950
CHAPTER ELEVEN
A way out?

868
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:40,620
'Hu?'

869
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:47,460
Hu could feel him looking at her. It was still
dark. Her leg hurt and she wanted to move

870
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:56,600
Marwa, who was still sleeping. It was cold
too. Hu was hungry. The fire was finished.

871
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:02,530
'Shhhhh said Hu, quietly. 'Don't wake Marwa,
Sean.'

872
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:08,710
'OK.' Sean's voice was quiet. He spoke softly
in Chinese.

873
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:16,350
'I just wanted to explain. I don't believe
this stuff about Declan Stanyer. I know his

874
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:22,120
game.' Sean sat closer to her.

875
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:28,290
'Noroko Ito. Ilse Sphenson. Fatima Rashid.
Darunee Phalavadhana. It's a long list. He's

876
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:30,690
been doing this since he came to the school.'

877
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:33,780
'Doing what?' asked Hu.

878
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:41,360
'His game. Girls. His "private lesson" game.
Rich girls. Pretty girls.'

879
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:48,120
'I'm not rich, Sean,' said Hu. She could sense
him smiling.

880
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:54,330
'Maybe not. But he thinks you are. First you
get the bad results, then he says you need

881
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:58,300
extra private lessons. You don't tell your
parents, do you?'

882
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:02,170
'No. But Sean, how do you know?'

883
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:09,900
'He tried it with my sister. She told me,
and I, er, spoke to him. He didn't like that

884
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:16,530
one little bit.' Sean paused. 'Did he invite
you back to his apartment to be "more comfortable"?

885
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:17,530
No?'

886
01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:25,380
'Yes, he did. I said no,' said Hu. 'He does
this to other students?'

887
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,030
Sean nodded.

888
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:29,440
Hu thought for a moment.

889
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,860
'Sean, what can I do?'

890
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:34,620
There was a moment's silence.

891
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:42,230
'I don't know, Hu. Do you want me to speak
to him? That man is bad news.' Sean sounded

892
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:43,230
sad.

893
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:49,640
'And now Melanie Gibson is saying things about
me?' Hu listened to the music of the stream

894
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:52,030
close by.

895
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:57,040
Perhaps Sean nodded. It was too dark to see.

896
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,310
'Sean. Listen...'

897
01:28:58,310 --> 01:29:06,900
They listened. They listened to the music
of the stream. 'Which way does water go?'

898
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:08,380
asked Hu.

899
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:13,550
'Hmm. Down. That's called "gravity",' said
Sean.

900
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:22,860
'Down means out, don't you see? We're sitting
in the Dongrak mountains. Out is the Korat

901
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:23,860
plateau.'

902
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:27,710
'I get you,' said Sean. He sounded excited.

903
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:34,330
'So we follow the stream, the water... we
follow it out of the park. No more turning

904
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:39,320
in circles, no more arguments about which
way is west.'

905
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:49,600
Sean sighed. 'So down means out. Cool, Hu!
We just follow the water.' Sean smiled in

906
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:50,600
the dark.

907
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:53,680
Now there was some hope.

908
01:29:53,680 --> 01:30:01,489
Dawn in a tropical forest is not a peaceful
matter. Everything that walks, or flies, or

909
01:30:01,489 --> 01:30:08,190
moves, wakes up screaming 'hungry!' It is
like a crazy symphony orchestra tuning up

910
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:15,570
before a concert. It is a market place, a
building site, an animal city, busy, busy,

911
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:17,330
busy. The rush hour.

912
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:26,610
'Wake up, Hu. Breakfast!' shouted Marwa. Marwa
was still very hungry, but she was no longer

913
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:33,950
the tired and frightened child of yesterday.
Hu had been asleep for perhaps an hour. Marwa

914
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:41,440
and Yoshiko pulled her to her feet. Marwa
gave Hu some sweets and her last biscuit.

915
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:49,050
'Hi!' shouted Sean, climbing back from the
stream. 'Your turn!' He and John and Thomas

916
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:53,270
had washed first. Now it was the girls' turn.

917
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:59,550
Ten minutes later, they all met at the spot
where the fire had been the night before.

918
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:05,100
Sean tried to use his mobile phone again,
but it still didn't work.

919
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:10,760
'Sean told me about your idea, Hu. It's the
only idea we have. We'll follow the direction

920
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:16,450
of the water - the stream - down and, I hope,
out of here,' said Thomas.

921
01:31:16,450 --> 01:31:22,000
'I'll go first with John. Sean will stay with
Marwa at the back,' said Thomas.

922
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,680
'I'm OK now!' shouted Marwa.

923
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:32,040
'Don't worry, little lady. We'll be out of
here soon,' said Sean. 'And I'll be right

924
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,060
behind you.'

925
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:35,830
They began to move slowly down the stream.

926
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:46,670
It wasn't easy. True, they were going downwards.
But, as they did so, the stream became wider

927
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:55,040
and steeper. They climbed from rock to rock.
Marwa seemed much stronger today, and Thomas

928
01:31:55,040 --> 01:32:01,660
seemed ready to hurry, to take chances. They
had water from the stream, which they didn't

929
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:07,950
want to drink, and nothing left to eat. They
all knew that if they didn't find the path

930
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:15,620
today there would be nothing for them tonight.
Thomas raced ahead, and Sean was very kind

931
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:21,780
to Marwa, pulling her, sometimes half carrying
her from rock to rock, as they climbed down

932
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,780
the stream.

933
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:30,050
Towards the middle of the morning, they heard
a helicopter. Sean stopped in the middle of

934
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:33,030
the stream and spread his arms.

935
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:36,510
'Mama... I love you!' he called.

936
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:44,450
'We must make a sign. Make smoke! A fire!'
screamed Thomas from below.

937
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:51,450
Sean climbed out of the water and collected
some dry wood. Hu helped him. Sean tried to

938
01:32:51,450 --> 01:32:57,540
start a fire, but his cigarette lighter was
wet. When the leaves and wood finally caught

939
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:01,890
fire, the helicopter had gone.

940
01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:05,970
Thomas said something in German. Then he ran
back to the stream.

941
01:33:05,970 --> 01:33:12,340
'Come on!' he shouted, running through the
moving water of the stream. He was soon out

942
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:13,780
of sight.

943
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:20,850
Thomas screamed. There was a crash and the
sound of water.

944
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:27,380
John and Sean ran to the stream first. There
were two large rocks and then a drop of about

945
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:34,650
five metres, a small waterfall. In the pool
below, they could see Thomas lying in the

946
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:43,060
water. He wasn't moving. The water next to
his head on the right side was red.

947
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:49,739
Sean didn't wait, not for a moment. He threw
his bag onto the bank of the stream and dived

948
01:33:49,739 --> 01:33:55,840
into the pool beside Thomas's body. The others
climbed down the bank to join him.

949
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:00,720
They found Sean holding Thomas in his arms
by the side of the pool.

950
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:08,500
'He's OK,' said Sean. 'He's breathing. But
he's unconscious. He hit his head.'

951
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:14,160
'How did you know the water was deep enough,
Sean?' asked Yoshiko.

952
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,050
'I didn't,' said Sean.

953
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:21,700
There was a deep cut on Thomas's head. He
seemed to be asleep.

954
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:30,400
'John, you take my bag. I'll take Thomas.'
Sean lifted Thomas onto his shoulders. Thomas

955
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:35,450
seemed to weigh nothing.

956
01:34:35,450 --> 01:34:42,120
Sean carried Thomas for another two hours
before they found a road. It was made of earth,

957
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:49,180
but wide enough for a car. They stopped. Sean
gently put Thomas down in the grass beside

958
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:58,280
the track. The others sat or lay by the road.
They were exhausted. Soon they heard the sound

959
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:05,200
of an engine. A lorry stopped about a hundred
metres in front of them. Hu stood up and started

960
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,470
to wave.

961
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:13,719
A tiny man in a grey uniform jumped down from
the lorry. He pulled out a gun and pointed

962
01:35:13,719 --> 01:35:18,230
it in the air, shooting the gun and screaming
and laughing.

963
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:21,620
'What's he saying?' asked Marwa.

964
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:30,570
'He says we are the BIA students that got
lost,' said Sean. 'He says it's OK! There

965
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:37,891
are helicopters. Television. Television? This
guy is crazy,' Sean was laughing. The little

966
01:35:37,891 --> 01:35:47,140
man climbed back into his lorry and drove
close to them. 'He says to climb in,' said

967
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:48,140
Sean.

968
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:55,120
Hu sat in the back of the oil company car.
She was half-asleep. Her father sat next to

969
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:56,120
her.

970
01:35:56,120 --> 01:36:02,750
'Hu, I'm so glad you're safe. When your friend
Sean made that telephone call, it was on the

971
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:10,320
Channel 7 television news. We've been so worried.'
The car moved quickly along the highway back

972
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:11,650
to Bangkok.

973
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:16,030
'Please don't worry, father,' said Hu, sleepily.

974
01:36:16,030 --> 01:36:24,540
'You're safe now. We'll soon be home. Oh,
and Hu?' Hu's father said softly.

975
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:27,969
'Hmm...?' said Hu. She was falling asleep.

976
01:36:27,969 --> 01:36:35,690
'One piece of good news. Your Aunty Wang the
one who gave you the ring? She's coming to

977
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:37,120
stay with us.'

978
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:44,780
But Hu was already asleep.

979
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:50,420
CHAPTER TWELVE
Nothing but the truth

980
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:55,880
Hu and John met in the library after lunch.
Hu couldn't help crying.

981
01:36:55,880 --> 01:37:04,030
'But Hu, I knew Stanyer was asking a lot for
his private lessons. But you sold your Aunty's

982
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:05,030
ring!'

983
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:10,860
'It was my ring!' cried Hu. 'But I didn't
know what to do.'

984
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:18,110
Miss Paula looked over her glasses and coughed
quietly. She was very worried about Hu. Since

985
01:37:18,110 --> 01:37:21,230
she had come back from the field trip, she
had seemed unhappy.

986
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:27,390
'When does your aunt come, Hu?' asked John.

987
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:33,739
'Sunday. And Stanyer wants two more lessons
before the English test for the IB on Friday.'

988
01:37:33,739 --> 01:37:35,630
Hu tried to stop crying.

989
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:42,100
'And from what Sean says, it's what he always
does. Did you speak to the other girls he

990
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:43,100
talked about?'

991
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:47,060
'I feel too stupid. I don't know what to say?'

992
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:56,160
'But Hu, what about Darunee Phalavadhana?
Her father's Wiwat Phalavadhana. He's an important

993
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:02,780
official in the Ministry of the Interior.
If he finds out... My mother knows him. Perhaps

994
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:06,210
I could speak to her?' John offered.

995
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:13,070
'But what can you say? "Are you one of Stanyer's
little friends?" Like Melanie is saying about

996
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:14,070
me?'

997
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:19,690
'I don't know, Hu. I think you've got to tell
someone about it. The story is coming out

998
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:24,200
already. You need to tell your side of the
story.'

999
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:31,500
Hu covered her face with her hands and cried.
'But I can't! Who can I tell?'

1000
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:38,040
'My mother?' suggested John. 'She knows you
from the school show... and she likes you.

1001
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,040
She knows there's nothing wrong with your
English.'

1002
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:49,320
'No!' Hu had raised her voice. Miss Paula
looked across at them. 'I'm sorry, John, I

1003
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:56,730
need to be on my own.' She got up quickly.
'I need to go and wash my face.'

1004
01:38:56,730 --> 01:39:04,570
John stayed in the library for a few minutes
after Hu had left. He tried to think. Eventually,

1005
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:11,920
he made a decision. He decided to tell his
mother, even if Hu wouldn't like it. He felt

1006
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:16,800
sad because he didn't want to do anything
behind Hu's back, but he couldn't see any

1007
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,090
other way to help her.

1008
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:25,430
Mr Riding, the school counsellor, spoke to
Hu as she hurried across the schoolyard from

1009
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:30,510
the library. He fixed Hu with his hard blue
eyes and smiled.

1010
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:38,670
'What's the hurry, Hu?' His stare seemed to
look right into her mind. 'You've been crying.'

1011
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:46,290
Hu nodded silently. Mr Riding frightened her.
People said he could have power over you with

1012
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:52,910
his eyes. His job was to counsel students
with 'problems', but he seemed to find problems

1013
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:55,550
when people didn't even know they had them.

1014
01:39:55,550 --> 01:40:01,650
'I've been watching you recently. You seem
worried and unhappy a lot of the time, and

1015
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:08,980
I've seen you crying several times. I think
we need to talk. Come to my office.'

1016
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:12,150
'But Mr Riding, I have classes...'

1017
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:19,350
Mr Riding stared at her hard. Then he turned
and walked to his office. Hu followed, her

1018
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:22,950
head down to hide the tears.

1019
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:29,630
From the library window, John saw Mr Riding
and Hu entering Mr Riding's counselling office.

1020
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:35,610
He picked up his books and half ran to his
mother's office.

1021
01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:42,370
'Sit down, Hu, and try and relax,' said Mr
Riding.

1022
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:52,340
'Relax?' thought Hu. 'Does he think I'm stupid?'
She sat very straight on the edge of a low

1023
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:59,090
armchair. Mr Riding went to the window, turned
and looked down at Hu. He was a tall man in

1024
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:02,870
his fifties with red hair which was turning
white.

1025
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:07,520
'Do you mind if I smoke?' he asked.

1026
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:14,710
Hu did mind if he smoked, and it was against
school rules. Mr Riding got out his pipe and

1027
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:16,900
started to light it.

1028
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,920
'No, go ahead,' said Hu.

1029
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:26,800
'Like I said, I've been very worried about
you for some time. Some of the other teachers

1030
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:33,401
have said that you're unhappy. How are things
at home?'

1031
01:41:33,401 --> 01:41:35,400
'Fine,' said Hu quietly.

1032
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:41,530
'You get on with your parents? I mean, you
talk about things with them?'

1033
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:50,690
'Yes.' Mr Riding waited, staring at her. Hu
felt uncomfortable. 'I... I do housework with

1034
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:54,120
my mother and she helps me with my singing...'

1035
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:59,050
'But can you talk about serious things with
her?'

1036
01:41:59,050 --> 01:42:00,410
Hu said nothing.

1037
01:42:00,410 --> 01:42:03,120
'What about your father?'

1038
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:08,219
'He's always very busy. We talk sometimes
in the mornings.'

1039
01:42:08,219 --> 01:42:14,540
'Do you talk about important things, Hu?'
Mr Riding left the window and sat down heavily

1040
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:22,340
in front of her. 'I mean, you're growing up,
Hu?' he said very quietly, never letting his

1041
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:25,730
hard blue eyes leave hers.

1042
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:29,760
Hu held her hands very tightly together and
looked away.

1043
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:34,840
'I understand you've been seeing a lot of
Mr Stanyer recently.'

1044
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:39,020
'He's been giving me extra classes,' said
Hu.

1045
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:45,280
'Look at me, Hu.' Hu tried. 'Do you like Mr
Stanyer?'

1046
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:50,320
'No!' shouted Hu, looking straight at Mr Riding.

1047
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:59,550
'Relax!' said Mr Riding, with a false laugh.
He paused. 'It's not so unusual for a young

1048
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:07,739
woman of your age to be... to be attracted
to an older man, a man in an... an important

1049
01:43:07,739 --> 01:43:12,300
position.' Mr Riding smiled to himself.

1050
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:17,130
Hu couldn't breathe, she was so angry. She
decided not to speak.

1051
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:24,760
'Uh huh,' said Mr Riding, standing up again
and walking towards the window. 'Does your

1052
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:30,200
father know about these, er, "extra lessons",
Hu?'

1053
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:31,550
'No. I...'

1054
01:43:31,550 --> 01:43:38,290
'Hu,' said Mr Riding, 'are you scared of your
father? Does he shout at you? Has he ever

1055
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:40,080
hit you?'

1056
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:47,570
That was when Hu could no longer keep her
anger inside. Suddenly she started crying,

1057
01:43:47,570 --> 01:43:55,800
and could not stop. Somehow, she told Mr Riding
the whole story.

1058
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:00,820
At the end of the interview, Mr Riding put
his arm round her and led her to the door.

1059
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:08,460
'What you've said is very serious. These are
very serious things to say about a teacher.'

1060
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:10,510
Hu tried to move away from him.

1061
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:11,510
'But...'

1062
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:16,980
'And I'm not sure you completely understand
your own feelings about this man, Hu.' He

1063
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:23,610
smiled. 'But don't worry. I think I can sort
this out. But we'll need to talk about this

1064
01:44:23,610 --> 01:44:29,140
again. In the meantime, I shall have to discuss
this with my colleagues.'

1065
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:31,330
Hu felt her stomach turn to ice.

1066
01:44:31,330 --> 01:44:38,630
'Now, off you go back to class, Hu. And try
not to worry.'

1067
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:43,450
Hu didn't go back to class. She went to the
main office and told the school nurse she

1068
01:44:43,450 --> 01:44:50,200
was feeling ill and then walked towards the
school gate. She met Mrs Patel carrying a

1069
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,700
pile of music.

1070
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:58,370
Are you going home, Hu?' asked Mrs Patel.
'What about the show? We have a rehearsal

1071
01:44:58,370 --> 01:45:00,440
after school. Are you OK?'

1072
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:05,989
'I'm sorry, Mrs Patel, I...' Hu started crying
again.

1073
01:45:05,989 --> 01:45:12,270
'It is all right now, my dear, Melanie can
take your place. She took your place when

1074
01:45:12,270 --> 01:45:18,480
you were in Khao Yai. She is getting much
better. But you must not miss any more, or

1075
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,820
I'll have to let her take the part of Dorothy
in the show.'

1076
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:30,040
Hu ran. She ran home, blinded by tears. She
let herself into the empty apartment, locked

1077
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:35,110
herself in her room and threw herself upon
her bed, crying.

1078
01:45:35,110 --> 01:45:43,680
Mrs Truman, John's mother, was late home.
She had been looking at Mr Stanyer's test

1079
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:50,630
records in the main school office and making
telephone calls. She said nothing to John

1080
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:54,400
and Mary when she entered her apartment, but
went straight into her study and closed the

1081
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:57,830
door. She picked up the telephone.

1082
01:45:57,830 --> 01:46:06,360
'Can I speak to Wiwat Phalavadhana... Wiwat?
Is that you?'

1083
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:09,590
The telephones were busy in Bangkok that night.

1084
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:16,780
It was the telephone ringing which woke Hu
a little later. She had cried herself to sleep.

1085
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:22,700
'Hello?' she said, her voice dry with crying.

1086
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:31,700
'May I speak with Mr Hu An Yuan? It's Mr David
Riding here from the Bangkok International

1087
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:32,700
Academy.'

1088
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:42,650
Hu's heart stopped. 'It's Hu here. Father
is still at work. Do you have his number?'

1089
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:51,320
And your mother's not there? OK. I'll phone
him at work.' He paused. 'Hu, are you still

1090
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:52,320
there?'

1091
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:56,340
Hu was thinking, 'What can I do?'

1092
01:46:56,340 --> 01:47:02,590
'Hu, I should tell you there will be a meeting
tomorrow at twelve o'clock. The things you

1093
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:08,120
told me about Mr Stanyer are very serious.
You can't just say those things about a teacher.'

1094
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:14,980
'But, Mr Riding, you were counselling me.
I trusted you!' cried Hu.

1095
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:21,239
'My main responsibility is to the school,'
said Mr Riding. 'Just make sure you and your

1096
01:47:21,239 --> 01:47:25,760
father come to the meeting. Twelve o'clock.'

1097
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:33,560
Hu made herself a cup of tea. She was too
tired to cry any more. What could she do?

1098
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:36,370
The phone rang again. It was John.

1099
01:47:36,370 --> 01:47:43,150
'Sorry, Hu, I wanted to phone you earlier,
but my mother's been using the phone for hours.

1100
01:47:43,150 --> 01:47:51,320
Are you OK? You weren't in class this afternoon,
and I saw you with Mr Riding. What does he

1101
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:52,320
want?'

1102
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:56,550
Hu quickly explained about the meeting tomorrow.
What could she do?

1103
01:47:56,550 --> 01:48:04,469
John's answer was simple. 'Tell your parents
the truth. Tell them everything. Tell them

1104
01:48:04,469 --> 01:48:10,100
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth. That's all you can do.'

1105
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:18,140
That was all she could do. Nothing but the
truth. Hu decided she would tell the truth.

1106
01:48:18,140 --> 01:48:23,480
The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth.

1107
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:27,920
She could hear her father and mother's voices
on the landing outside the apartment and a

1108
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,420
key in the lock of the entrance door.

1109
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:36,420
The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth.

1110
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:44,410
Later that night, much later, Verity Truman
drove back to the school. She went to the

1111
01:48:44,410 --> 01:48:51,220
main office and took the master keys to the
classrooms. Quietly she let herself into Mr

1112
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:56,920
Stanyer's classroom and tried the drawer of
his desk. Locked, as she expected.

1113
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:05,260
'God forgive me!' she said under her breath.
She took a knife from her pocket and opened

1114
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:11,640
the locked drawer.

1115
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:16,830
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The moment of truth

1116
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:21,770
In an office in the Upper School building,
Verity Truman was sitting, staring at her

1117
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:22,770
telephone.

1118
01:49:22,770 --> 01:49:32,580
'Come on, Wiwat. Come on!' She looked at her
watch again. Nearly twelve o'clock.

1119
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:38,870
Meanwhile, in another part of the school,
Hu and her mother and father were waiting

1120
01:49:38,870 --> 01:49:44,950
outside the principal's office. They could
hear voices from inside. Hu and her mother

1121
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:48,170
and father said nothing.

1122
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:55,860
Hu thought about her parents. They had been
surprisingly calm when she had told them her

1123
01:49:55,860 --> 01:50:00,780
story. Her mother had been unhappy about Aunty
Wang's ring. 'It's been in the family for

1124
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:08,050
a long time!' she had said. 'Your Aunty Wang
had it, her mother, and now you!'

1125
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:15,060
But her father didn't think it was so very
important. 'Aunty Wang had so many jewels,

1126
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:22,980
she won't notice,' he had said. Then, very
sadly, he added, 'Hu, it was your ring, and

1127
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:31,170
your decision. You are almost an adult, a
young adult. Now this is your problem, your

1128
01:50:31,170 --> 01:50:36,560
responsibility. It was yours to sell. But
you should not have sold it secretly.'

1129
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:45,690
Hu's father had seemed sad, not angry, Very
carefully, he had questioned Hu for every

1130
01:50:45,690 --> 01:50:51,970
detail of her problems with Mr Stanyer. Like
a good lawyer, he had got the whole story

1131
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:57,110
from her - he had even made her show him the
book where she had written down the dates

1132
01:50:57,110 --> 01:51:00,840
of the classes and the money she had paid
Mr Stanyer.

1133
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:05,170
'But why didn't you tell me?' he had asked.

1134
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:11,343
'Because you want me to be a doctor so much,
and with bad results in English, they won't

1135
01:51:11,343 --> 01:51:16,090
let me do the IB. I didn't want to disappoint
you, father.'

1136
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:23,670
It was late when Hu's father was satisfied
that he had the whole story. He told Hu to

1137
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:28,330
go to bed, but before she left, she asked
him.

1138
01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:31,640
'Father, do you believe me?'

1139
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:32,922
Hu's father didn't answer immediately.

1140
01:51:32,922 --> 01:51:41,980
'I want to believe you,' he said at last.
'You wanted to improve your results, so you

1141
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:48,770
did extra lessons. That is not a bad thing,
although you should have told us. But these

1142
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:55,370
are terrible things you say about Mr Stanyer.
I want to believe you, but there have been

1143
01:51:55,370 --> 01:52:03,280
too many lies, and too many secrets. And I
haven't met Mr Stanyer yet. I want to believe

1144
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:12,469
you, but I must decide tomorrow in the meeting.
Now, good night, little one.'

1145
01:52:12,469 --> 01:52:18,830
Mr Grisman stood very tall and serious in
his black suit and Cambridge University tie.

1146
01:52:18,830 --> 01:52:23,820
He stood at the door of his office and asked
Hu and her parents to come in.

1147
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:29,600
'Do sit down. Let me introduce you,' Mr Grisman
said.

1148
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:34,989
Sitting at the long table in Mr Grisman's
very grand office were three other men in

1149
01:52:34,989 --> 01:52:40,840
suits. By the door Mr Stanyer sat, staring
at nothing.

1150
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:47,250
Hu and her mother and father sat down at the
table. Mr Grisman took his seat opposite Mr

1151
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:54,300
Stanyer and the Hu family. On his left Mr
Riding sat, leaning back and playing with

1152
01:52:54,300 --> 01:53:01,700
his empty pipe. On his right was Khun Preecha,
chair of the Board of Governors. He was a

1153
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:08,500
tall Thai man with grey hair and he looked
at Hu steadily with sad, intelligent eyes.

1154
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:11,100
He didn't smile.

1155
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:14,420
Mr Grisman continued in his important voice.

1156
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:22,230
'This is a very serious matter, very serious
indeed. Your daughter has said some very serious

1157
01:53:22,230 --> 01:53:29,469
things about our Mr Stanyer. Your daughter's
behaviour is quite unacceptable. She has deliberately

1158
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:36,620
tried to harm him,' Mr Grisman raised his
voice, and the good name of the Academy itself.'

1159
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:41,440
He paused. Khun Preecha looked embarrassed.

1160
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:47,550
Hu looked at her mother and father. Her mother
looked pale and frightened. Her father's face

1161
01:53:47,550 --> 01:53:55,180
showed no emotion at all. He simply sat and
stared at Mr Grisman without expression.

1162
01:53:55,180 --> 01:54:01,690
Mr Grisman continued. 'I have invited Khun
Preecha to be here because we must decide

1163
01:54:01,690 --> 01:54:08,250
if, because of the things she's said about
Mr Stanyer, Hu can continue to study at the

1164
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:09,250
Academy.'

1165
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:16,199
Hu's father said nothing, and the expression
on his face didn't change. Hu's mother was

1166
01:54:16,199 --> 01:54:23,510
looking down, afraid to meet Mr Grisman's
eyes. Mr Stanyer was trying not to smile.

1167
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:27,190
Hu closed her eyes.

1168
01:54:27,190 --> 01:54:33,070
In her office, Verity Truman was walking up
and down. She picked up the telephone to see

1169
01:54:33,070 --> 01:54:39,860
if it was working and quickly put it down
again. 'Wiwat, where are you? They must have

1170
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:43,370
started by now!' she said to herself.

1171
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:51,670
'Now,' said Mr Grisman, 'we must consider
just exactly what Hu Jian Ming has said about

1172
01:54:51,670 --> 01:54:52,670
Mr Stanyer.'

1173
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:56,660
Mr Stanyer nodded, but he looked uncomfortable.

1174
01:54:56,660 --> 01:55:03,250
'Firstly, that he has been giving her private
lessons for money in the school itself, outside

1175
01:55:03,250 --> 01:55:12,180
of school hours. This is clearly untrue. That
would be a very serious matter indeed. Mr

1176
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:16,699
Stanyer has told me that he simply wished
to give Hu some extra work after class, a

1177
01:55:16,699 --> 01:55:22,300
very kind and generous offer on his part.
Of course, no money was involved.'

1178
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:30,840
Hu's mouth fell open. Hu's father's face didn't
change. Mr Grisman hurried on.

1179
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:38,190
'Secondly, she says that Mr Stanyer gave Hu
bad results in order to persuade her to take

1180
01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:44,890
these "private lessons". A very serious matter.'
Mr Grisman looked at Hu angrily. 'You are

1181
01:55:44,890 --> 01:55:51,840
a student, Miss Hu; Mr Stanyer is a teacher,
a professional.'

1182
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:55,760
Still Hu's father's face didn't change.

1183
01:55:55,760 --> 01:56:02,750
'Thirdly,' Mr Grisman continued, 'that on
one occasion Mr Stanyer invited her back to

1184
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:09,820
his apartment for further lessons and "to
be more comfortable".' Mr Grisman looked at

1185
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:15,910
Hu's parents angrily. 'I hope you realise
just how serious this is?'

1186
01:56:15,910 --> 01:56:24,030
There was a long silence. Hu's father stared
back at the school principal. He said nothing.

1187
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:31,860
'And lastly, she says that other female students
have been in the same situation. We needn't

1188
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:34,930
discuss that. There have been no other complaints.'

1189
01:56:34,930 --> 01:56:39,390
There was another long silence.

1190
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:49,610
'Now, Hu Jian Ming,' said Khun Preecha, softly.
'What have you got to say for yourself?' He

1191
01:56:49,610 --> 01:56:54,120
looked at her in a kind and interested way.

1192
01:56:54,120 --> 01:57:01,320
Quietly and with dignity, Hu's father spoke.
He looked first at Khun Preecha and then at

1193
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:03,560
Mr Grisman.

1194
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:10,260
'Principal, my daughter has told me about
the things that happened with Mr Stanyer.

1195
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:14,110
I will try to explain her point of view.'

1196
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:21,989
The men on the other side of the table looked
at each other. Mr Grisman, Declan Stanyer

1197
01:57:21,989 --> 01:57:29,719
and David Riding seemed to be smiling. Khun
Preecha was not. He turned to look at Hu Jian

1198
01:57:29,719 --> 01:57:35,510
Ming. His eyes didn't leave hers.

1199
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:42,280
Verity Truman looked at her watch again. She
reached for the phone. 'May I speak to Wiwat

1200
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:50,230
Phalavadhana?' she asked. 'Left his office?...
When?... Coming here?... No, no. Thank you,

1201
01:57:50,230 --> 01:57:58,180
thank you.' She replaced the phone. She placed
her hands together and made a prayer. 'Please,

1202
01:57:58,180 --> 01:58:01,860
please don't let the traffic be too bad!'

1203
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:10,949
Hu's father spoke very well, but the three
men facing him didn't seem to believe him.

1204
01:58:10,949 --> 01:58:17,550
He showed them the book Hu had used to write
down the times and money for her private lessons.

1205
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:20,030
Suddenly Mr Riding sat forward.

1206
01:58:20,030 --> 01:58:28,780
'Principal, may I have that?' Mr Grisman gave
it to him. 'Hmph!' He laughed briefly. 'This

1207
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:36,050
is pure teenage story telling.' He laughed
some more. Mr Riding's laugh was not a happy

1208
01:58:36,050 --> 01:58:37,200
or a funny laugh.

1209
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:44,800
'It's not unusual for teenage girls to have
strong feelings for older men, particularly

1210
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:51,340
men in an important position. A teacher perhaps.
Hu makes up a story about Mr Stanyer giving

1211
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:55,610
her bad results because she doesn't like the
truth.

1212
01:58:55,610 --> 01:59:01,300
The truth is that her results in English just
aren't good enough. And she can't tell her

1213
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:04,360
father because she's afraid of him.'

1214
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:11,290
Hu's father showed emotion at last. He went
very red in the face.

1215
01:59:11,290 --> 01:59:19,360
'And then...' Mr Riding spoke slowly, smiling.
'And then we have the invitation back to Mr

1216
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:25,700
Stanyer's apartment.' He turned and looked
at Hu. 'Would you like Mr Stanyer to invite

1217
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:28,460
you back to his apartment?'

1218
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:36,010
Hu looked at Mr Stanyer. He was smiling back
at Mr Riding. She looked at her father. She

1219
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:43,830
had never seen him so angry. Khun Preecha
was not smiling. He was looking down; she

1220
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:46,180
couldn't meet his eyes.

1221
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:53,960
'At last!' said Verity Truman looking up.
Wiwat Phalavadhana was standing in the door

1222
01:59:53,960 --> 02:00:00,550
of her office, holding up his bag. He was
a small, bright-eyed man of about forty, well-dressed

1223
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:02,460
and with a proud and happy smile.

1224
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:05,760
'I have it, Verity!' he said.

1225
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:10,330
'Let's go!' They hurried out of her office.

1226
02:00:10,330 --> 02:00:18,460
'I think we must make a decision,' said Mr
Grisman. 'And this is it. Mr Riding has shown

1227
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:25,700
that Hu Jian Ming has some very serious problems.
I think it is these problems which have led

1228
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:33,570
her to say these things about our friend and
colleague, Mr Stanyer.' Mr Riding nodded.

1229
02:00:33,570 --> 02:00:41,960
Then the door of the principal's office opened.

1230
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:44,810
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
A path to the future

1231
02:00:44,810 --> 02:00:55,230
'Mrs Truman!' said Mr Grisman angrily. 'I
am in an important meeting. I...' He stopped.

1232
02:00:55,230 --> 02:01:01,100
He was embarrassed. He didn't want the chair
of the school's Board of Governors, Khun Preecha,

1233
02:01:01,100 --> 02:01:08,180
to see him shouting at his head of Upper School.
Then he noticed the person standing behind

1234
02:01:08,180 --> 02:01:10,170
Verity Truman.

1235
02:01:10,170 --> 02:01:18,461
It was Khun Wiwat Phalavadhana. Mr Grisman
knew how important he was. Wiwat gave Mr Grisman

1236
02:01:18,461 --> 02:01:20,580
a very warm smile.

1237
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:27,739
'I...' Mr Grisman began again. 'I'm sorry.
This is a very important meeting about one

1238
02:01:27,739 --> 02:01:29,470
of our teachers.'

1239
02:01:29,470 --> 02:01:37,030
'That's what we want to talk to you about,'
said Verity Truman. 'I think... we're sure

1240
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:42,489
that what Hu Jian Ming has been saying about
Mr Stanyer is true.'

1241
02:01:42,489 --> 02:01:47,770
Khun Preecha stared at Mrs Truman. He was
listening carefully.

1242
02:01:47,770 --> 02:01:54,930
'Surely there must be some misunderstanding,'
said Mr Grisman. 'But come in, come in.'

1243
02:01:54,930 --> 02:01:58,930
Verity and Wiwat entered the office.

1244
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:05,670
We don't think so. We don't think Hu has misunderstood
at all,' said Verity, opening her bag and

1245
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:12,910
bringing out some papers. 'And other people
don't think so either. There are other students

1246
02:02:12,910 --> 02:02:18,550
involved, female students. I've spoken to
their parents and some of the students too.

1247
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:23,020
Mr Stanyer's little game has been going on
for some time...'

1248
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:30,150
'Stories, Verity,' said Mr Riding. 'Teenage
stories made up by teenage girls. They don't

1249
02:02:30,150 --> 02:02:36,760
understand their own feelings, they talk together...
Then they make up some story. If one girl

1250
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:43,199
tells a story, if six girls tell a story,
it's still a story.' He looked at the principal.

1251
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:45,960
Mr Grisman looked nervous.

1252
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:51,960
'They're all telling the same story, Mr Riding,'
Verity Truman threw the papers down on the

1253
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:56,100
table in front of the principal. 'And I've
been checking the results of the students

1254
02:02:56,100 --> 02:03:03,160
Mr Stanyer has been giving "private lessons"
to. They all had good results until they came

1255
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:09,850
to his class, and the older ones have had
good results since they left his class. I

1256
02:03:09,850 --> 02:03:12,810
think he's been changing the results... downwards.'

1257
02:03:12,810 --> 02:03:21,770
'But Mrs Truman, you're not an English teacher.
You are attacking a colleague...' Mr Grisman

1258
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:23,190
was very angry.

1259
02:03:23,190 --> 02:03:29,080
'And the girls all tell the story about being
invited back to his apartment to be "more

1260
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:30,080
comfortable".'

1261
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:36,400
'A story,' said Mr Riding, but he seemed less
certain now.

1262
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:43,570
'Perhaps I can speak now?' said Wiwat Phalavadhana,
taking some papers from his case. He gave

1263
02:03:43,570 --> 02:03:50,881
them to Khun Preecha who nodded his head in
thanks. The papers were in Thai. 'Mr Stanyer

1264
02:03:50,881 --> 02:03:55,640
does not have permission to work in Thailand.'

1265
02:03:55,640 --> 02:04:02,140
A small administrative problem, Khun Wiwat.
I was not responsible for giving Mr Stanyer

1266
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:04,130
the job,' Mr Grisman said.

1267
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:09,030
'Mr Stanyer asked for permission to work in
Thailand about three months before he joined

1268
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:14,840
the Academy,' Wiwat said. 'He wanted to work
for a small private school - Audio English

1269
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:22,739
- on Siam Square. There was a problem. I telephoned
the director of Audio English. He told me

1270
02:04:22,739 --> 02:04:27,320
they had checked Mr Stanyer's qualifications
back in the USA...'

1271
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:29,389
Mr Grisman looked at his hands.

1272
02:04:29,389 --> 02:04:35,679
'... and found that there was no student called
Mr Declan Stanyer at Ohio State University.

1273
02:04:35,679 --> 02:04:42,910
No record. They didn't believe he was qualified.
Since then Mr Stanyer has been coming in and

1274
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:49,179
out of Thailand on tourist visas every few
months.'

1275
02:04:49,179 --> 02:04:55,920
Mr Grisman was shaking his head. 'I was not
responsible for giving Mr Stanyer a job. My

1276
02:04:55,920 --> 02:05:01,840
head of Upper School, Dr Nyondo, gave him
the job. But surely it's an administrative

1277
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:05,500
problem?' said Mr Grisman, looking at Wiwat.

1278
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:10,929
'It's the law, Mr Grisman,' said Khun Preecha,
quietly.

1279
02:05:10,929 --> 02:05:18,760
'And I think you'd better see these,' said
Verity. She handed Mr Grisman a large brown

1280
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:22,860
envelope. 'I found them in Mr Stanyer's desk
drawer.'

1281
02:05:22,860 --> 02:05:29,980
'You've been looking in the drawer of his
desk, Mrs Truman?' Mr Grisman was shocked.

1282
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:34,590
He took the envelope and pulled out a pile
of magazines.

1283
02:05:34,590 --> 02:05:41,820
Mr Grisman was silent for a moment. His face
went white. Everyone was looking at him as

1284
02:05:41,820 --> 02:05:47,870
he looked at the magazines. He opened one
of the magazines and shut it again quickly.

1285
02:05:47,870 --> 02:05:53,180
He shut his eyes. Then he stood up. He screamed:

1286
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:55,540
'Mr Stanyer!'

1287
02:05:55,540 --> 02:06:02,940
But Mr Stanyer wasn't there. His chair was
empty. The door of the principal's office

1288
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:05,380
was open.

1289
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:11,510
Mr Stanyer had left them.

1290
02:06:11,510 --> 02:06:16,360
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
The right career

1291
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:22,070
Hu found her parents standing outside the
school hall with Verity Truman and the principal,

1292
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:28,780
Mr Grisman. It was a warm night. The summer
was coming. Hu was still wearing her make

1293
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:37,400
up and her costume, her special clothes as
Dorothy. Hu felt wonderful, the show was a

1294
02:06:37,400 --> 02:06:38,400
success!

1295
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:43,860
As she came closer to the group of adults,
she could see that Mr Grisman was talking

1296
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:46,800
very quickly and waving his arms.

1297
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:54,010
'Just disappeared! Three weeks now, and no-one's
seen him. Of course the police are still interested.

1298
02:06:54,010 --> 02:07:01,230
But I had no idea! I was away when he was
given the job. The head of Upper School then,

1299
02:07:01,230 --> 02:07:07,260
Mr Nyondo, had made the arrangements. And
of course, the school will pay back the money

1300
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:15,500
Hu spent on the, er...' Mr Grisman laughed
nervously. 'The "private lessons". But your

1301
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:24,010
daughter was wonderful, wonderful. A Chinese
Dorothy!' Mr Grisman seemed to find this very

1302
02:07:24,010 --> 02:07:25,010
funny.

1303
02:07:25,010 --> 02:07:31,320
'Wonderful!' said Verity Truman, taking Hu's
arm and smiling warmly.

1304
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:36,460
Sean and Thomas joined the group. Sean was
also still in costume and make up.

1305
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:41,579
'Sean, you were wonderful!' shouted Verity.

1306
02:07:41,579 --> 02:07:47,960
Everyone was talking at once. John Truman
and his sister, Mary, joined them. Marwa and

1307
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:54,400
Yoshiko joined the group. They all told Hu
and Sean how wonderful the show had been.

1308
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:59,320
'Hu, I'd like you to meet someone,' said Verity.

1309
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:06,929
A tall Thai woman in a lovely silk dress came
over and joined the group. Hu's mother admired

1310
02:08:06,929 --> 02:08:12,610
the woman's dress. Hu's father simply stared.
Hu was embarrassed.

1311
02:08:12,610 --> 02:08:19,910
'This is Dr Irene, Director of the Bangkok
Operatic Society,' said Verity.

1312
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:28,610
'Is this the star? Hu Jian Ming?' said Dr
Irene. 'I thought your performance was wonderful,

1313
02:08:28,610 --> 02:08:37,989
Hu. You sing beautifully. Have you had any
training?' Hu introduced Dr Irene to her mother.

1314
02:08:37,989 --> 02:08:41,820
They soon began talking about opera together.

1315
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:47,280
Hu took the opportunity to speak to Thomas.
She hadn't seen him since the Khao Yai field

1316
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:50,430
trip because he had been in hospital.

1317
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:57,540
'Thomas, I'm sorry you couldn't be in the
show,' said Hu. 'Are you OK now?'

1318
02:08:57,540 --> 02:09:04,219
'Yes, thanks to him,' said Thomas. He pretended
to hit Sean. Sean pretended to fall over.

1319
02:09:04,219 --> 02:09:08,469
'I don't like hospital. Too many doctors.'

1320
02:09:08,469 --> 02:09:10,620
Hu's mother came towards them.

1321
02:09:10,620 --> 02:09:17,590
'Dr Irene wants you to sing with the Operatic
Society, Hu,' Hu's mother said in an excited

1322
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:20,970
voice. 'And she's a professional singer!'

1323
02:09:20,970 --> 02:09:26,330
'I'm a semi-professional singer,' said Dr
Irene. 'I'm a professional doctor.'

1324
02:09:26,330 --> 02:09:33,500
'She's the senior doctor at the Pattana Clinic,
Hu,' said Hu's father. He was full of pride

1325
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:40,910
for his daughter. 'She wants you to sing in
their new show.'

1326
02:09:40,910 --> 02:09:48,720
'Do you like Mozart, Hu?' asked Doctor Irene.
'Our next show at the Operatic Society is

1327
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:51,150
a Mozart opera.'

1328
02:09:51,150 --> 02:09:53,020
Hu looked at Dr Irene.

1329
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:56,960
'Well?' said Dr Irene.

1330
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:58,670
Then Hu looked at her father.

1331
02:09:58,670 --> 02:10:09,250
'A singer and a doctor?' she said to her father,
smiling. 'Or a doctor and a singer?'
