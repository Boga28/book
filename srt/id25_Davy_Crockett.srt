00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:06,590
CHAPTER ONE
Young Davy

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:17,419
Davy Crockett was born on August 17, 1787,
in Greene County, Tennessee. In 1787 America

3
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:22,630
was a new nation. Most of the territory was
a wilderness.

4
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:29,730
Davy Crockett was born in the wilderness.
His father, John Crockett, was an Irish immigrant.

5
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:37,000
He fought in the American Revolution. He was
a very courageous man.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,090
Davy had a difficult childhood. His family
was poor. When he was twelve years old, his

7
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:52,320
father said, "Davy, our family doesn't have
any money. You must go to work as a cattle

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
herder."

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,010
"All right, father," said Davy. "I'm happy
to help the family!"

10
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:08,570
Davy travelled four hundred miles on foot.
He took cattle from Tennessee to other places.

11
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:19,490
When he finished his work, he was far from
home. He was lost! Davy walked 400 miles.

12
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,770
When he returned home, he was very tired.

13
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:34,729
Davy gave his father the money he made. His
father was happy and said, "Thank you, Davy!

14
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,450
Now we have some money for the winter months."

15
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,190
"I can do it again to help the family," Davy
answered.

16
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:50,670
The years passed. Davy went to school when
he had time. He spent most of his time hunting

17
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:58,450
in the forest. He was the best shooter and
hunter in Tennessee. He entered many shooting

18
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:06,520
competitions and won them all. He called his
rifle "Old Betsy."

19
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,980
For years Davy hunted bears and other wild
animals. He was a trapper. Once he hunted

20
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,780
one hundred bears in six months!

21
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:26,500
It was dangerous to hunt bears hut Davy was
very courageous and strong. He knew the forest

22
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:35,849
well. The Indians were his good friends. He
ran fast and was a strong fighter. He fought

23
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,020
with the wild cats of the mountains.

24
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:47,340
Some people said that one day Davy saw a racoon
in a tree. He wanted to shoot it but the racoon

25
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,430
saw him and said, "Wait a minute! Are you
Davy Crockett?"

26
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,250
Davy answered, "Yes, I am!"

27
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:05,610
The racoon answered, "Then don't shoot! I'll
come down from the tree." And the racoon came

28
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,739
down from the tree!

29
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,460
CHAPTER TWO
The Creek Ware

30
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:22,989
Everyone liked Davy Crockett. He was always
happy, with a big smile. He was honest and

31
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:25,920
always helped others.

32
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:34,361
Davy was a tall man. He wore a coonskin cap,
buckskin trousers and a buckskin jacket. He

33
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:40,269
always carried his long rifle, "Old Betsy."

34
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,780
In 1806 Davy married Polly Finley.

35
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,849
She was a school teacher.

36
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:57,580
They had two sons and a daughter: John, Joseph
and Judith. After a few years, the Crockett

37
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:05,770
family moved into the Tennessee hills. The
Tennessee hills were near hostile Indian country.

38
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:14,550
In 1812 the war between the United States
and Britain began. The Mohawk and Creek Indians

39
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:21,720
fought with the British against the Americans.
The American General Andrew Jackson organized

40
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:29,580
a small army. He wanted to fight the Creek
Indians and the British.

41
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:37,430
Davy fought with this army. He was a scout
because he knew the territory well. His work

42
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:45,630
as a scout was very important. Davy travelled
across Tennessee, the Mississippi Territory,

43
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:52,550
Florida and Louisiana with General Jackson's
army. The Battle of New Orleans was a big

44
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,250
victory for General Jackson and the Americans.
The war ended in 1814.

45
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:07,470
The British lost the war. The Indians lost
their territories and went away. New American

46
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,740
families settled in the Tennessee hills.

47
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:19,270
At the end of the war Davy returned home to
his family. Unfortunately, his wife Polly

48
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:27,500
died. Life was again difficult for Davy. He
worked as a trapper and took care of his three

49
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
children.

50
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:38,919
After some time, Davy met Meg Mackinack. Meg's
father was an American trapper. Her mother

51
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:47,490
was a Cherokee Indian. Davy fell in love and
married her. They had twins. Davy named the

52
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:54,280
twins George and Washington, in honour of
America's first president. There were now

53
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:01,570
five children in the Crockett family!

54
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:07,870
CHAPTER THREE
Davy Enters Politics

55
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:14,539
Davy and his big family wanted to live in
Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. Davy bought a covered

56
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:23,450
wagon. He and his family put all of their
things inside the wagon: chairs, tables, beds,

57
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:30,570
clothing and many other things. Four strong
horses pulled the big wagon. Davy and his

58
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:38,990
wife sat in the front. The five children were
inside the wagon.

59
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:44,800
After travelling in the forests and mountains,
they arrived in Lawrenceburg. This was their

60
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:53,699
new home. Davy opened a mill. He was a hard
worker. His neighbours liked him. Everybody

61
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,810
in Lawrenceburg liked him.

62
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:03,289
He became a representative of the town government.
He was very popular. People liked listening

63
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:09,690
to his stories about hunting bears and about
the War of 1812. They admired his honesty

64
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,810
and courage.

65
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:19,139
Davy was different from other politicians.
His speeches were never boring. His message

66
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:27,030
was clear. He spoke to the people in simple
language. He dressed like them too. He always

67
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,520
wore his coonskin cap and his buckskin trousers
and jacket.

68
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,300
One day at an important meeting he didn't
know what to say. So he looked at the people

69
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:46,940
and said, "Today, I am like a man trying to
drink water from an empty barrel! I'll tell

70
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,460
you a funny story and then we can go home!"

71
00:07:52,460 --> 00:08:00,110
Davy soon became a representative of the government
of Tennessee. Now he was in politics. He helped

72
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,979
his people in many ways.

73
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:09,740
At first, many politicians laughed at Davy
because he never wore a suit. After some time,

74
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:16,740
these politicians admired and respected him.
Davy was an honest man. Everyone believed

75
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,990
what he said.

76
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:26,060
His buckskin jacket had two big pockets. In
his right pocket Davy had a bottle of whisky.

77
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,660
When he met his friends, he gave them some
whisky! In those days, it was common to give

78
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:38,899
some whisky to friends.

79
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:44,629
CHAPTER FOUR
Congressman Crockett

80
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:50,199
Davy often went to Nashville, the capital
of Tennessee. In Nashville, he worked for

81
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:55,949
the Tennessee Government. One day, while Davy
was working for the Tennessee Government,

82
00:08:55,949 --> 00:09:03,240
a big flood destroyed his mill. This was terrible!
He was very unhappy because he lost a lot

83
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,199
of money.

84
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:14,350
When he returned to Lawrenceburg, he started
a new type of work. This time he made barrels!

85
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:23,160
He sold these barrels in New Orleans, Louisiana.
New Orleans was about 400 miles away.

86
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,910
To go to New Orleans, he travelled on the
Mississippi River. He had a big boat to carry

87
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:36,689
the barrels. It was difficult to travel on
the Mississippi River. There were many dangers.

88
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:43,899
One day his boat had a bad accident. It began
to sink. Davy almost drowned. He lost his

89
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:49,899
boat and his barrels but he didn't lose his
life!

90
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:58,670
In 1827 there was a big election in Tennessee.
Davy Crockett became a United States Congressman!

91
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:04,230
This was a great honour for him. In the United
States Congress, he represented the people

92
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:11,649
of Tennessee. He travelled to Washington D.
C., the capital of the United States.

93
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:19,209
Davy was very happy to be a Congressman. He
wanted to help his people. There were Congressmen

94
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:25,170
who wanted to take land away from the Fox
Indians of Tennessee. Davy protected these

95
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,139
Indians. He fought against dishonest Congressmen.

96
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:36,509
"The Fox Indians cannot live without their
land!" Davy shouted. "I must defend all the

97
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:42,839
American people of Tennessee: the whites and
the Indians!"

98
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:49,269
After months of hard work, Davy was not able
to help the Fox Indians. The U. S. Congress

99
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:56,949
made a law that took away land from the Indians.
Davy was very angry. He hated injustice. In

100
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:04,709
1835 he left the U. S. Congress!

101
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:07,829
CHAPTER FIVE
Texas!

102
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:17,199
In 1835 the Crockett family left Tennessee.
They put all their things in a big covered

103
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:27,160
wagon and they travelled for many days. They
finally arrived in Texas.

104
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,940
At that time, Texas belonged to Mexico. At
first, the Mexican Government was happy with

105
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,829
the American settlers. They cultivated the
land.

106
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:44,319
Many settlers went to Texas because land was
very cheap. With a little money, a settler

107
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:51,859
bought a lot of land. More and more Americans
went to Texas. There were about 20,000 American

108
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:59,769
settlers in eastern Texas. There were only
5,000 Mexicans! The Mexican Government did

109
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:06,029
not like this. There were too many Americans!

110
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:12,660
Mexico decided to close its borders. The American
settlers were very angry.

111
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:22,040
In 1834, the Mexican General Santa Anna became
the dictator of Mexico. He was a cruel man.

112
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,399
He sent his soldiers to the Mexican border.
He did not want American settlers to enter

113
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,749
Mexico.

114
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:37,670
By 1834, there were more than 30,000 Americans
living in Texas. They wanted Texas to be an

115
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:45,480
independent American state! They did not want
to live under a cruel Mexican dictator.

116
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:51,619
Davy and his family now lived in Texas. They
were happy in their new home. They wanted

117
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:55,250
the independence of Texas, too.

118
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:02,429
One day Davy heard that the Mexicans wanted
to attack Fort Alamo. The Alamo was a Spanish

119
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:10,249
church and fort near San Antonio, in western
Texas. There were Texans and American soldiers

120
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:19,220
at Fort Alamo. There were also women and children
at the fort. War was in the air! Davy knew

121
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,959
he must fight for the independence of Texas.

122
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:30,009
CHAPTER SIX
Fort Alamo

123
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:37,089
Davy asked other American settlers to go to
the Alamo with him. Few men wanted to fight.

124
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:44,459
But this did not stop Davy! He and 15 men
decided to go to the Alamo. They were ready

125
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,959
to fight the Mexicans.

126
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:57,629
There were 112 men at the Alamo. Colonel William
Travis of the U.S. Army was the commander.

127
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:05,819
William Travis was a young colonel. He was
only 27 years old. He was a lawyer. He entered

128
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:12,980
the U.S. Army to fight for the independence
of Texas. One day, Colonel Jim Bowie and 30

129
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:21,959
men arrived at the fort. Jim Bowie was a tall,
strong man. He was a hunter and trapper.

130
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:30,509
"Good evening, Colonel Travis," said Colonel
Bowie. "I have a message for you from General

131
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:34,299
Sam Houston. Here is the letter."

132
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:38,910
Colonel Travis opened it. He read it aloud:

133
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:45,769
You must destroy the Alamo and come with my
army! General Santa Anna will attack the Alamo

134
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:46,800
soon.

135
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,449
Gen. Sam Houston

136
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:57,509
"What!" said Colonel Travis. "I don't want
to destroy the Alamo. I want to defend it."

137
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:04,619
Colonel Bowie said, "We cannot defend the
Alamo. We must have more men."

138
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:12,790
In February 1836, Davy Crockett and his men
arrived at the fort. Colonel Travis was happy

139
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,540
to see them. He asked Davy and his men to
defend the Alamo.

140
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:25,100
"We don't have many men," said Colonel Travis.
"We must ask for more soldiers. I am sending

141
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,629
a messenger to General Fannin. He can send
us more soldiers."

142
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:38,110
Davy said, "My men and I want to defend the
Alamo. We are hunters and trappers. Our long

143
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,459
rifles can shoot at a great distance."

144
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:48,079
Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie became good friends.
Together they repaired the walls of the fort.

145
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:55,509
They cleaned the rifles and the cannons. They
were ready for the battle.

146
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:59,779
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Red Flag

147
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:07,420
One morning a messenger arrived. "I have a
message from General Fannin: He is very sorry.

148
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:16,829
He cannot send any soldiers. You must leave
the Alamo now. General Santa Anna is near.

149
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:18,699
You are all in danger."

150
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:26,239
"We don't want to leave the Alamo," said Jim
Bowie. "We want to fight for the independence

151
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:31,051
of Texas. How many soldiers has General Santa
Anna got?"

152
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:38,019
"He's got about 4,000 soldiers!" said the
messenger.

153
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:45,220
Colonel Bowie looked at Colonel Travis. "We
must speak to our men," said Colonel Travis.

154
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,689
"Yes," said Bowie, "we must speak to them."

155
00:16:50,689 --> 00:17:00,470
Colonel Travis called his 187 men. He said
sadly, "General Santa Anna is coming to attack

156
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:11,620
us. He has about 4,000 soldiers and lots of
ammunition. We have only 187 men and little

157
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:19,000
ammunition. We have little food and water.
Remember, there are women and children in

158
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,439
the fort."

159
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,640
Then he marked a line on the ground with his
sword. "Those who want to fight for the independence

160
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,870
of Texas, cross this line! The others can
leave the fort and go home."

161
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:41,929
There was a very long silence. Davy thought
about his wife and his five children. Then

162
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:48,590
he thought about the independence of Texas
and the American settlers. He thought about

163
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,250
a new American state: Texas!

164
00:17:53,250 --> 00:18:00,650
All the men crossed the line. These men wanted
to defend the Alamo. These men wanted an independent

165
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,049
Texas.

166
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:11,640
On February 23, 1836, General Santa Anna and
his army arrived. He sent a messenger to the

167
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:19,350
Alamo. He wanted the people in the Alamo to
leave. The men in the Alamo answered with

168
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:26,060
a cannon shot! They did not want to leave.
They did not want to return to the United

169
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:36,159
States. General Santa Anna was furious. He
showed a red flag. The red flag meant: No

170
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,870
Prisoners! He wanted to kill everyone in the
fort!

171
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:50,549
On February 24, 1836, General Santa Anna's
army attacked the Alamo. The Mexicans had

172
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:58,679
an enormous cannon. It shot a cannon ball
that damaged a wall of the fort.

173
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:05,610
Davy said, "We must destroy that cannon. It
can destroy the walls of our fort."

174
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:13,010
That night, Davy and Jim Bowie left the fort.
They went to the Mexican camp. Everyone in

175
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:20,740
the camp was sleeping. Davy and Jim silently
passed behind the two Mexican guards. They

176
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:27,669
put mud and stones in the enormous cannon.
Then they returned to the Alamo.

177
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:35,880
The next morning, the Mexican army used the
cannon. It exploded! The Mexicans were very

178
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,259
surprised. Their enormous cannon was destroyed.

179
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:47,360
The men in the Alamo killed many Mexican soldiers.
The Mexican army attacked many times during

180
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:56,100
the day. But the Texans and the American army
defended the Alamo.

181
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,090
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Massacre

182
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:08,820
The days passed. The battle continued. There
was little food and ammunition. The men in

183
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:15,129
the Alamo fought courageously. Nothing stopped
them!

184
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:22,450
After twelve days of fighting, General Santa
Anna sent all of his army to attack the fort.

185
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:30,000
On March 6, at 5 a.m., the Mexican bugles
played the "Deguello." The "Deguello" was

186
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,639
a war song. It meant "Death for everyone."
The women and children at the fort were tired

187
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:41,789
and afraid. The situation was desperate.

188
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:49,820
The men at the Alamo heard the "Deguello."
They understood the message. General Santa

189
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:55,760
Anna's army attacked the fort from all sides.
It was a terrible battle. Everyone was shooting.

190
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,970
Cannon balls were flying. A lot of men were
injured. Some men were killed. Davy and the

191
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,070
other men defended the fort. They sent back
the Mexicans twice.

192
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:15,710
The third time, the Mexicans entered the fort.
They killed many people: men, women and children.

193
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,509
It was a massacre!

194
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:25,909
Jim Bowie was a great fighter. He was a strong
man and he was never afraid. He fought with

195
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:33,050
his famous Bowie knife. He killed many Mexican
soldiers. At the end of the day, three Mexican

196
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:38,129
soldiers killed Jim Bowie.

197
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:44,080
Davy and the other men fought until the end.
They killed many enemy soldiers. It was a

198
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:52,509
desperate battle. Four Mexican soldiers killed
Davy with a long knife. The tall, courageous

199
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:58,700
trapper fell to the ground!

200
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:05,330
Only two women and two children were alive
after the massacre. But General Santa Anna

201
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,990
did not kill them. These women and children
returned home.

202
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:16,840
The Mexicans burnt the bodies of the dead
people. It was a big victory for General Santa

203
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:23,700
Anna. He lost 1,544 men at the Alamo.

204
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:32,410
On April 21, 1836, General Sam Houston and
his army attacked General Santa Anna. General

205
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:39,669
Houston made General Santa Anna prisoner.
Santa Anna then signed a treaty. This treaty

206
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:44,860
said that Texas was independent! Everyone
remembered

207
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:52,460
Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, Colonel Travis and
the other men. They died for the independence

208
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:59,870
of Texas. Texas became a state of the United
States in 1845.

209
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:06,330
All through his life, Davy Crockett did what
he believed was right. With his honesty and

210
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:14,150
determination, he became a national hero.
Davy Crockett was the perfect example of the

211
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:23,690
American free spirit. In his life story Davy
wrote, "I leave this rule for others when

212
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,289
I'm dead:

213
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:29,509
Always be sure you're right-then go ahead!"

214
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:29,669
- THE END -
