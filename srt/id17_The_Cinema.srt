00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,140
CHAPTER ONE
'Let's go to the cinema!'

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:11,679
Today it is possible to buy or hire a video
and watch a film at home, but millions of

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,500
people all over the world still prefer to
go to their town or city cinema for a 'night

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,320
out'. And before television arrived in people's
homes, a visit to the cinema was something

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,490
really special to look forward to.

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,290
The 'golden age' of film-making - and going
to the cinema - was between about 1930 and

7
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:44,520
1950. Film stars seemed like kings and queens.
Cinemas were 'picture palaces' where, for

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,070
the price of a ticket, you could enter into
a magical world where anything and everything

9
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,600
was possible.

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:03,260
In 1946, 1,650,000,000 cinema tickets were
sold in Great Britain. That's thirty-three

11
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,160
tickets for every man, woman and child in
the country.

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:16,930
And in the year 1939 - the year when audiences
first saw Cone With The Wind - 30,000 people

13
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:26,140
were employed by the big film studios in Hollywood.
They made 400 films every year. Americans

14
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:32,560
called the moving pictures, 'the movies',
and fifty million of them went to the cinema

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,820
every week. They wanted to see the magic of
the movies!

16
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:57,570
But how did it all begin...?

17
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,750
CHAPTER TWO
In the beginning

18
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,890
The first moving pictures were simple 'shadow
shows' or 'shadow plays'.

19
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:14,601
Then came the magic lanterns which projected
painted glass slides on to a screen. These

20
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:21,370
became very popular in Europe in the 18th
century, and lantern showmen travelled from

21
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,750
village to village.

22
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:31,360
But in the 1820s, Nicephore Niepce invented
photography, and soon photographs were used

23
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,800
instead of the much more expensive glass slides.
But these were not movies. The pictures did

24
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,150
not move. To make moving pictures it is necessary
to take a large number of photographs very

25
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:53,680
quickly, one after the other. Then, when the
photographs are projected, the person or animal

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,400
in the picture appears to move.

27
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:04,069
In 1878, the British photographer, Eadweard
Muybridge, who was living in California, fixed

28
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:10,490
twelve cameras beside a racetrack and took
pictures of a racehorse - very quickly, one

29
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:17,250
after the other. The American inventor, Thomas
Edison, watched the work of Muybridge with

30
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:25,750
great interest. (Edison had invented the phonograph
- an early 'record player' - in 1877.) By

31
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:33,690
1890, William K. L. Dickson, who was working
with Edison, had managed to take 'moving pictures'

32
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,470
with something called the Kinetograph.

33
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:45,850
In 1893 the world's first film studio was
built by Edison in West Orange, New Jersey.

34
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,000
Actors from Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show,
and Barnum and Bailey's Circus were filmed

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,450
there. The films were shown in Kinetoscope
machines. These machines did not project the

36
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:05,630
film on to a screen, they had 'peep-holes'
that one person at a time could look through.

37
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:12,260
It was the Lumiere brothers, in France, who
invented a camera and projector in one - the

38
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:19,709
Cinematographe. Now large audiences could
watch projected pictures on a screen. And

39
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:25,690
because films were longer, people were happy
to pay more to see them.

40
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:32,750
The Lumiere brothers gave the first performance
of their Cinematographe in Paris in 1895,

41
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:41,060
in a room under the Grand Cafe, 14 boulevard
des Capucines on 28th December. They borrowed

42
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:48,430
a hundred chairs from the cafe, but only thirty-five
seats were sold at one franc each. But it

43
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,460
was the world's first 'film show'.

44
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:59,530
Then Edison introduced the Vitascope projector
in New York on April 23, 1896. And by the

45
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:06,820
end of that year, films were flickering on
screens all over Europe and America. (Films

46
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,190
were often called 'flickers' or 'flicks'.)

47
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,960
At first, people did not mind what they watched,
it was exciting enough just to be able to

48
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,440
see real moving photographs of people and
animals.

49
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,340
But slowly films with stories began to appear,
and the Frenchman, Georges Melies, began to

50
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:35,800
use clever photography to make strange things
happen. These were some of the first 'special

51
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,180
effects'.

52
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,120
Film fact

53
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,870
There was a bad accident in May 1897. A Cinematographe
show was part of the great Charity Bazaar

54
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:54,220
in Paris. But the projectionist was careless
and the film caught fire. This started an

55
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:18,940
even bigger fire, and 140 people died. Many
of them were very rich and important people.

56
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:24,240
CHAPTER THREE
The cinema comes to Hollywood

57
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,430
How did Hollywood begin? A Kansas couple,
Harvey and Daidia Wilcox, came to Los Angeles

58
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:39,251
in 1883, when there were just orange and lemon
farms in the area. Three years later, they

59
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:45,000
owned fifty hectares of land which they called
Hollywood.

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,919
The Wilcoxes sold the land, bit by bit, and
the first Hollywood studio was built in 1911

61
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:59,710
by the Nestor Company. The American filmmakers
came to California because the weather was

62
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:08,060
good, and because the Californian workers
were cheap to employ. In 1913, Cecil B. DeMille

63
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:14,820
came to Hollywood and started what became
known as Paramount Studios. Universal Studios

64
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:21,010
started about the same time, the Fox Company
two years later (joining with 20th Century

65
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:30,370
Pictures in 1935), United Artists in 1919
and Warner Brothers, MGM, and Columbia in

66
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:38,170
the early 1920s. If you wanted to 'get into
the movies', Hollywood was the place to go!

67
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,600
The first films were silent. The words of
the actors appeared on cards which were shown

68
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,820
every twenty seconds or so. Suitable music
was played during the film by an orchestra,

69
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,169
or by one person on a piano.

70
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:59,010
Edwin S. Porter was the filmmaker who introduced
film 'editing' - cutting the film and putting

71
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:04,670
it back together again with the shots in a
different order. This made the films more

72
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:12,580
exciting to watch. His film, The Great Train
Robbery (1903), is a good example of this.

73
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:19,890
Until 1910, audiences did not know the names
of their favourite actors and actresses. Actresses

74
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:25,980
were given names like 'The Biograph Girl'
or 'The Vitagraph Girl' or were not named

75
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:32,630
at all. Carl Laemmle, chief of Independent
Motion Pictures (which later became Universal

76
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:41,320
Studios) was the first to name a star, when
he employed Florence Lawrence. By 1913, every

77
00:08:41,320 --> 00:09:00,790
studio was naming its actors and actresses.

78
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,730
CHAPTER FOUR
Famous faces

79
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,170
Although the first films were silent, during
the years after 1910, going to the cinema

80
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,990
was becoming more and more popular.

81
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,570
Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton were busy
making audiences laugh.

82
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,790
Rudolph Valentino, an Italian actor, became
the 'great lover' of the silent screen, and

83
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:30,240
millions of women sent him love letters after
films like The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

84
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:40,709
and The Sheik (both 1921). Sadly, he died
in 1926 when he was only thirty-one.

85
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:46,079
Douglas Fairbanks was the star of some of
the best adventure films... and audiences

86
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:49,800
loved the beautiful Clara Bow.

87
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:56,441
One very famous silent film was The Birth
of a Nation, directed by D. W. Griffith. It

88
00:09:56,441 --> 00:10:03,649
was first shown in 1915 and was almost three
hours long. It was about the American Civil

89
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:10,339
War, and a lot of people who had never been
inside a cinema before came to see this film.

90
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:16,790
The first 'serial' - a film shown a bit at
a time, usually one bit (or 'episode') each

91
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:25,759
week - arrived in 1912. Audiences rushed back
each week to see the next episode. A favourite

92
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:34,170
serial was The Perils of Pauline (1914) starring
Pearl White. Pearl had to fight Indians in

93
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:41,800
one episode, was pushed off the Rocky Mountains
in another, and was blown up at sea in another.

94
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,040
But she always seemed to escape for another
exciting day.

95
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,850
Film fact

96
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:58,100
By 1916, Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin
were each earning $10,000 a year. By 1918,

97
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:18,529
both had contracts for more than $1 million
a year.

98
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:22,220
CHAPTER FIVE
The golden age

99
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,640
The golden age of the cinema began with the
talkies - when the actors on film were able

100
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:36,290
to talk for the first time. In 1927, at New
York's Warner Theatre, Al Jolson, the Russian-born

101
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,779
Hollywood actor and singer, spoke, and sang
six songs in the Warner Brothers film, The

102
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:49,209
Jazz Singer. The first words that he spoke
in the film were: 'You ain't seen nothing

103
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,180
yet!' The audiences loved him.

104
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,829
At first there were many problems with talking
pictures. Microphones picked up the noises

105
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:05,429
in the studio, directors had to stop shouting
orders to the actors, and the actors had to

106
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:08,680
learn all their words.

107
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,239
Some stars of the silent screen could not
make the change to 'talkies'; audiences laughed

108
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:21,120
at their funny voices. But the deep, mysterious
voice of silent star Greta Garbo was a great

109
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:29,600
success when she appeared in Anna Christie.
The film magazines said: 'Garbo talks!' (She

110
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,819
also made it fashionable for women of the
time to wear berets!) Garbo's career ended

111
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:43,420
in 1942 when she left Hollywood, saying that
she would never act again.

112
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:50,939
By 1930, all films were 'talkies', and many
actors and directors moved from the theatre

113
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:58,809
into the cinema. Actors like Edward G. Robinson,
Spencer Tracey, Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable

114
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:03,779
and Bette Davis began to appear on the screen.

115
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:09,899
Musical films began to be popular in the 1930s.
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers starred in

116
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:18,829
Flying Down to Rio (1933). This was the first
of nine films which they made together.

117
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:24,429
And then there were the fast-moving crime
films of James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart and

118
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:30,319
Edward G. Robinson. One of the best was The
Roaring Twenties.

119
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:37,639
The 1930s also introduced 'singing cowboys'
like Roy Rogers and Gene Autry. But it was

120
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:44,709
the film Stagecoach, directed by John Ford
in 1939, which made a star of one of Hollywood's

121
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:49,180
most famous cowboys - John Wayne.

122
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:55,769
The year 1939 was when audiences first saw
what is now sometimes described as the greatest

123
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:03,369
film ever made: Gone With The Wind, starring
Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. The book appeared

124
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:11,660
in 1936 and sold a million in the first six
months. The film has earned more than $300

125
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:18,410
million, and won eight Oscars (with the first
one ever given to a black actress, Hattie

126
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,970
McDaniel, who played the part of 'Mammy').

127
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,459
Film fact

128
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:33,029
Alfred Hitchcock made the first British talking
picture in 1929. It was called Blackmail,

129
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:40,249
and was first written as a silent film. Hitchcock
quickly added words and sound when he saw

130
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:59,389
how popular talking pictures were becoming.

131
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:02,989
CHAPTER SIX
The 'star system'

132
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:10,000
In 1932, Technicolor introduced a camera which
could produce 'natural' colours for the films

133
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,739
that were shown in the cinemas. Filming in
Technicolor was expensive, but soon every

134
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:22,929
kind of movie could be seen for the first
time 'In Glorious Technicolor.'

135
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:29,480
The golden age of the cinema continued through
most of the 1940s. Audiences filled the 'picture

136
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:37,069
palaces' in their towns, enjoying exciting
films like Citizen Kane, Casablanca and Double

137
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:44,269
Indemnity, and musicals like Meet Me in St
Louis and Easter Parade.

138
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:49,879
During the Second World War, many people went
to the cinema for another reason as well.

139
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:55,989
They could see the main film, but they could
also see newsreels - films of the week's news

140
00:15:55,989 --> 00:16:01,579
- with all the latest film and information
about the war.

141
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:09,870
At this time, actors worked for just one company.
This was known as the 'star system'. MGM Studios

142
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:15,779
told everyone that it had 'more stars than
there are in heaven' working for them; stars

143
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:24,959
like Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Jean Harlow,
Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable and Joan Crawford.

144
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,410
Studios often chose or wrote stories especially
for their big stars.

145
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:35,459
And sometimes a director would be brought
in from another studio to do a film because

146
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:41,939
that star liked him, or worked well with him.
Or a cameraman would be brought in because

147
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:47,720
he knew how to make the star look his or her
best on screen.

148
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,290
The Academy Awards are given every year by
the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and

149
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,100
Sciences. They are called 'Oscars', and they
are supposed to have got their name because

150
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,320
they looked like the Uncle Oscar of Margaret
Herrick, a lady who worked in the Academy

151
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:11,709
film library. The first Awards were given
in May, 1929, and the Oscars were awarded

152
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:20,420
for silent films only. In 1930, the award-giving
was broadcast on the radio, and today it is

153
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:26,430
seen on TV by millions of people all over
the world.

154
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,910
Film fact

155
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:39,060
One star, Marlon Brando, was paid $2.25 million
for ten days work on Superman (1978). He appears

156
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:59,020
on the screen for about ten minutes in the
film.

157
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,310
CHAPTER SEVEN
Bigger and better!

158
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:09,100
In the 1950s, people stopped going to the
cinema two or three times a week, and stayed

159
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:16,860
at home to watch TV instead. The cinema queues
got shorter, and the film companies realized

160
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,170
that they had to fight back. They tried to
do this by making films that looked as different

161
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,530
as possible from TV.

162
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:34,190
TV in the 1950s was in black-and- white, and
the pictures were shown on very small screens.

163
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:40,580
So the cinema produced Cinemascope, which
made it possible to show films on a much wider

164
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:48,400
screen than ever before, and, of course, in
colour. And 'big screens' meant 'big' films

165
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:58,630
that looked good on a wide screen. Films like
The Robe (1953) and Ben Hur (1959).

166
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:04,750
Then came 3-D, where the pictures seemed to
jump off the screen at the audience.

167
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:11,790
Warner Brothers had a success with House of
Wax in 1953, and there were nearly twenty

168
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:20,760
more 3-D films shown in cinemas that year.
Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder (1954)

169
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,740
was popular. But the people in the audience
had to wear special coloured glasses to see

170
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:33,570
the effects of 3-D, and they soon became bored
with having to do this. And so the studios

171
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,000
stopped making 3-D films.

172
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,890
Cinerama films were popular for a short time,
but it needed three projectors and a bigger

173
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:49,000
screen again to show them. People had to move
their heads from side to side to see what

174
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,270
was happening at both ends of the screen!
But Cinerama films were very expensive to

175
00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:02,110
make, and it was difficult to put the very
big screens into most cinemas.

176
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:08,080
The studios continued their fight with TV,
but television was becoming more and more

177
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:17,100
popular. Then, in 1955, RKO studios needed
money quickly to stay alive, and they sold

178
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:24,240
their films to television. Other studios soon
began to do the same and old films became

179
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,270
popular on TV.

180
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:33,230
But although the 'golden age' of the cinema
was finished, films continued to be made.

181
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:41,000
And there were some big successes - like the
James Bond films From Russia with Love (1963),

182
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,170
and Goldfinger (1964). There were popular
family films starring Julie Andrews - Mary

183
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:59,050
Poppins (1965) and The Sound of Music (1965).
Then the 1970s brought The Godfather (1972),

184
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:10,940
Jaws (1975), Star Wars (1977) and Superman
(1979). In the 1980s, young people hurried

185
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:21,980
to see E.T. The Extra- Terrestrial (1982),
Ghosthusters (1984), Back to the Future (1985)

186
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,490
and Batman (1989).

187
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:32,780
And in the 1990s came Stephen Spielberg's
Jurassic Park (1993) with its wonderful special

188
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:39,440
effects and exciting story. You can see the
video of Jurassic Park at home on your own

189
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,050
television. But the special effects are much
more frightening on a big screen in a dark

190
00:21:46,050 --> 00:22:03,120
cinema.

191
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,420
CHAPTER EIGHT
Animation

192
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:13,570
Mickey Mouse, Tom and Jerry, Popeye, Rugs
Bunny. All these famous cartoon characters

193
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:18,580
began their lives as simple pictures on paper.

194
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,770
Cartoon characters are painted on to sheets
of clear film, called 'cels', so that the

195
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:30,140
painted 'background' can be seen through the
unpainted parts of the cel. Then they are

196
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:36,590
photographed. Each cel will have one picture,
and each picture will be a little different,

197
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,890
to make the characters appear to move when
they are projected at twenty-four pictures

198
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,190
every second.

199
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,140
The characters must look and sound the same
in every film.

200
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:55,760
Everybody recognizes the voice of Bugs Bunny
('Eeh, what's up, Doc?'), spoken by Mel Blanc.

201
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,150
Blanc also gave the character the name 'Bugs'.

202
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:06,230
The most famous producer of animated films
was Walt Disney. He introduced Mickey Mouse

203
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:14,870
to audiences in 1928 in a black-and- white
cartoon, Plane Crazy. At first the mouse was

204
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:20,460
called Mortimer, but then the name was changed
to Mickey.

205
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:27,410
Disney also produced the first Walt Disney
colour cartoon, Flowers and Trees (1932),

206
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:34,210
and the first animated feature film, Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs. More followed:

207
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:43,430
Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, Bambi, Cinderella,
The Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians, The Jungle

208
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:50,220
Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas and
The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

209
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,350
Walt Disney studied at the Kansas City Art
Institute. He made animated cartoons for the

210
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:01,880
Kansas City Film Ad Company before going off
to Hollywood and starting a company with his

211
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,700
brother Roy in 1923.

212
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:12,650
In the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (1988),
cartoon characters and real actors appear

213
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,150
together.

214
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:20,700
Today, more and more animators are using computers,
instead of employing people to do all the

215
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,730
painting.

216
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:29,520
Some animators use marquettes (models) instead
of pictures, and bend the model's arms and

217
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:36,640
legs, or change its face, to make the character
'move'. Creature Comforts, produced by Aardman

218
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:59,100
Animations, who use models in all their films,
won an Oscar for best animation.

219
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,050
CHAPTER NINE
Behind the camera

220
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:09,241
A lot of people are needed to make a film,
as well as the actors and actresses. They

221
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:15,270
are all the other people whose names appear
at the beginning or end of a film. Some of

222
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:22,630
them have strange-sounding jobs like 'Best
Boy' or 'Key Grip'. Let's look at just some

223
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,540
of them.

224
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:30,360
Producer - the person who chooses which film
to make, who gets the money needed to make

225
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,580
it, and who takes care of all the business
problems.

226
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:42,220
Director - the person who decides how to 'shoot'
(or film) each scene, and who controls all

227
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:47,610
the actors and other people who are helping
to make the film. The director is the one

228
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:53,690
who shouts 'Action!' when he or she is ready.
One piece of film which is filmed without

229
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,300
stopping the camera is called a 'take'.

230
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:04,890
Screenwriter - the person who writes the screenplay
or script of a film. Sometimes many screenwriters

231
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:10,610
are employed before a director is happy with
a screenplay. And when a book is made into

232
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:17,700
a film, it is not usually the writer of the
book who writes the screenplay. A screenwriter

233
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,110
is usually given this job.

234
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:27,720
Editor - the person who 'cuts' and then puts
together the film after the filming has finished,

235
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,070
and makes it into the final movie.

236
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:37,300
Set Designer - the person who arranges the
furniture and scenery needed in the film.

237
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:42,890
The designer often plans by making models
of the scenery before working on the final

238
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,520
set.

239
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,080
Wardrobe Designer - the person who designs
or chooses the clothes that the actors wear

240
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,410
in the film. These are often got from special
companies who keep every kind of film and

241
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:00,270
theatre clothes that you can think of.

242
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,690
Gaffer - the lights and lighting chief in
the studio.

243
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,150
Best Boy - the Gaffer's assistant.

244
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,970
Key Grip - the person who moves the camera
around.

245
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:18,180
Boom Operator - the person who moves the microphone
above the heads of the actors when they are

246
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,610
speaking.

247
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,730
Film facts

248
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:33,559
In the film, Cleopatra, made in 1963, 26,000
costumes were used. But 32,000 were used to

249
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:37,710
make the film Quo Vadis in 1951.

250
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:44,960
Warner Brothers paid $5 million to American
writer, Tom Wolfe, to make the film of his

251
00:27:44,960 --> 00:28:09,750
book, Bonfire of the Vanities (1990), starring
Tom Hanks, Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis.

252
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,840
CHAPTER TEN
Inside or outside?

253
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:22,081
In the very early years of the cinema, almost
all filming was done outside. Today, filming

254
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:29,140
is done 'on location' when it is impossible
to build a real city, or a mountain or something,

255
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:36,809
inside the studio. Also, some directors prefer
to film on location. It is then that the cameras

256
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:40,400
go out into the real world.

257
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,300
All of some films are shot on location, but
others have only short outside scenes to join

258
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,740
with the scenes that are shot in the studio.

259
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,170
As an example, suppose it is important to
show a policeman arriving at an office on

260
00:28:55,170 --> 00:29:03,020
Fifth Avenue, in New York, and meeting a businesswoman
inside the building. A location film crew

261
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:08,390
will 'shoot' the policeman getting out of
a taxi on Fifth Avenue and walking into the

262
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:14,900
office building. But the scene where he meets
the businesswoman in the office will be filmed

263
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:19,880
inside a studio, perhaps days or weeks later.

264
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,690
All studios have large 'stages' where the
sets are built. One of the biggest in the

265
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:31,500
world is at the British studios of Pinewood
in Buckinghamshire, where one of the stages

266
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,720
is 102 metres long.

267
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,260
Sets are sometimes used for more than one
film, and this was very true for cowboy films

268
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:49,180
that were made in the 1920s and 1930s. Then,
a Hollywood studio often made thirty or forty

269
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,910
of them in a year, and the street where the
cowboys had their final gunfight often appeared

270
00:29:54,910 --> 00:30:00,300
in film after film, with only small changes.

271
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,210
Film facts

272
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:09,860
The largest number of locations used in a
Hollywood film was 140, for Around the World

273
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,570
in 80 Days (1956).

274
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:21,300
The largest number of cameras used for a single
scene was forty-eight for the sea battle in

275
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:41,020
the 1925 film of Ben Hur.

276
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,450
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Special effects

277
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:52,020
Special effects are used when it is too difficult,
too dangerous, or too expensive to do something

278
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:58,230
in the usual way. They are used to make the
audience think that they are seeing something

279
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,690
which they really are not.

280
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:08,200
For example, small models of towns or buildings
are very useful. In films, when you see a

281
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:14,690
house catch fire, a plane crash, or a bomb
blow up a ship, you are probably watching

282
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:22,920
a model house, plane and ship. But you do
not realize this when you see it on the film.

283
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:30,700
The big dinosaurs in the film Jurassic Park
(1993) were not real, of course! Lots of models

284
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,250
were made of each of them.

285
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:40,110
Today, computers are used more and more in
special effects, making the impossible seem

286
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,050
possible.

287
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:48,429
The first 'special effect' happened in the
film The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,

288
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:56,130
which was made in the Edison studios in 1895.
The audience appear to see Queen Mary's head

289
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:03,210
being cut off, but the director stopped the
camera and changed the actress for a dummy,

290
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:22,620
whose head was cut off in the next shot.

291
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:27,080
CHAPTER TWELVE
Stunts and make-up

292
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,970
Stuntmen and stuntwomen are used when something
is too difficult or too dangerous for the

293
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:42,750
actor to do. Every stunt is carefully planned
before filming, and must be as safe as possible.

294
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:48,060
They wear the same clothes and make-up as
the star, and are usually filmed so that their

295
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,600
faces are not seen clearly.

296
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,660
They wear special clothes that will not catch
fire if they are to be filmed in a 'burning'

297
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:05,470
building (although often there is more smoke
than fire, and the fire is carefully controlled).

298
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:10,301
Stuntmen often wear padding under their clothes
so that they do not hurt themselves when they

299
00:33:10,301 --> 00:33:15,559
fall from something like a horse or a moving
car.

300
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:21,440
Guns are not real guns, and knives are usually
made of rubber so that they will bend when

301
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,670
somebody is hit. Stuntmen who fall from buildings
will fall onto something soft (which you won't

302
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:35,800
see in the final film, of course!). The important
thing is that it looks real.

303
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:41,840
Some stars do their own stunts, although film
companies would prefer that they didn't. The

304
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,450
director doesn't want his star to get hurt
- it's too expensive for the film! Mel Gibson

305
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:56,420
did all his own stunts in Mad Max Beyond the
Thunderdrome (1985).

306
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:02,740
The make-up artist can change a nice-looking
actor into something very frightening... or

307
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:09,899
a beautiful young actress into an old woman.
It took eight-and-a half hours each day to

308
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:19,210
change the actress Francesca Annis into a
100-year-old woman in the 1982 film Krull.

309
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:24,569
Rubber masks are made for the actor to wear
when it is necessary to make very big changes

310
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:32,819
to their face. Wigs, beards, moustaches, false
eyelashes - all these things help to make

311
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:35,079
a 'character'.

312
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:55,260
It is even possible to make a man look like
a woman!

313
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,999
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Picture palaces

314
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:06,529
The greatest of all the 'picture palaces'
built in the 1920s and 1930s was the Roxy

315
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:17,440
Cinema in New York. It cost $12 million to
build and had 6214 seats. Three hundred people

316
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:26,809
worked at the cinema, with sixteen projectionists
and 110 musicians. It also had a hundred singers,

317
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:34,299
and a group of dancers to keep the audience
happy - and its own hospital! The Roxy opened

318
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:41,460
in March 1927 and closed in March 1960.

319
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,450
Most of the cinemas in the big cities seemed
like palaces to the film-goer. Inside were

320
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,369
comfortable seats, thick carpets and coloured
lights.

321
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:58,230
There was often a restaurant, and sometimes
a dance floor, too. Some American cinemas

322
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:04,420
had creches where mothers could leave their
babies while they went to watch the film.

323
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:10,579
A man or woman played a cinema organ while
audiences waited for the film to begin. The

324
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:16,059
organ came up out of the floor as the music
started.

325
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:17,609
Film fact

326
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:24,220
The drive-in cinema became popular in the
early 1950s in America - very popular with

327
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:48,609
young people! More than 4000 drive-ins opened
between 1948 and 1956.

328
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:52,720
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
What happens next?

329
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:59,460
Today, cinema audiences are much smaller (and
usually younger) than the audiences of the

330
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:06,230
'golden age'. Many of the 'picture palaces'
are now 'multi-screen' cinemas with four or

331
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:10,589
five small cinemas inside one building.

332
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:17,890
Today's films appear on video, and then on
TV, after they have been seen by cinema audiences.

333
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:25,339
But some old films don't look so good on TV.
Cowboy films are an example of this. The wonderful

334
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:33,089
scenery in films like How the West Was Won
needs a large screen to show it at its best.

335
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:38,810
Television can't do it. For many people, the
cinema is still the only place to watch a

336
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,980
film.

337
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:50,259
One of the cinema's newest ideas is IMAX projection.
A screen 19 metres high and 15 metres wide,

338
00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:56,119
and excellent sound, makes an audience feel
that they are 'really there'.

339
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:02,640
IMAX DOME theatres have a big, 30 metre screen
which puts the audience right in the centre

340
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,599
of everything that is happening in the film.

341
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:13,059
And with IMAX 3D, people find themselves reaching
out to try and touch what they can see, it

342
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:15,089
is so real!

343
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:21,650
There are nearly 150 IMAX theatres in different
countries all over the world, and more are

344
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:24,750
being built every year.

345
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,780
So this is cinema today.

346
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:34,790
And as Al Jolson said in The Jazz Singer,
'You ain't seen nothing yet!'

347
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:45,789
- THE END -
