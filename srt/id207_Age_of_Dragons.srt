CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,700
Brothers in Oath

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:13,660
It has been a long day and Timucin is very
tired, but that is unimportant.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:20,270
He looks at the arrow he has just been given
and tries to remember if he has ever seen

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,690
anything as beautiful before.

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,699
The arrow is far more decorated than all the
others he has seen.

7
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,210
And he has seen a lot of arrows.

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:41,120
After all, his father is the khan - and not
just any khan, but the most powerful and feared

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,980
for many days' ride.

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,760
His yurt is full of the most splendid bows
and arrows hanging on the walls.

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,910
Often, other tribes come to visit.

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,250
These tribes have beautiful weaponry too.

13
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:06,580
Not just spears, shields and glinting swords,
but artfully carved bows and even more exquisite

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,140
arrows.

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,390
So far, he has never seen an arrow like this
one.

16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:21,150
It is longer than his arm, not as long as
the arrows the men use, but at least two hands

17
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,020
longer than the ones he and the other boys
use to practise - and the carvings are so

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,900
detailed that he is almost afraid to touch
it.

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,650
The arrowhead is not made of iron, but of
bronze.

20
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,561
This makes it weak and practically useless
against anything with even thick fur, let

21
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,820
alone against hardened leather or plate armour.

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:52,869
Then again, this kind of arrow is not intended
to be used like that.

23
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:59,950
The soft metal has been engraved with artful
lines and symbols, and the edges have been

24
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:09,060
so carefully polished and sharpened that it
could probably split a hair in half.

25
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,290
As he looks at it, Timucin is ashamed.

26
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,879
"It is... it is beautiful," he says.

27
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,680
"I've never seen anything so beautiful.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,989
You are a true artist."

29
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:34,790
Chuzir pulls a face as if Timucin has just
said something indecent or spoken badly of

30
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,260
the gods.

31
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:42,379
He too holds an arrow in his hand, the one
that Timucin has given him in return for this

32
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:45,040
stunning work.

33
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,989
He is almost convincing as he pretends to
admire it, even if there is very little to

34
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,370
admire.

35
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,829
It is a completely normal arrow, short and
not even entirely straight.

36
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:06,260
Timucin has polished the iron head as much
as he can and added a few simple carvings

37
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,999
with as much skill as his clumsy fingers allow.

38
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:16,239
Chuzir is kind enough not to say anything
about it.

39
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:25,629
"I am no artist," answers Chuzir after a noticeable
pause and in an almost offended tone of voice.

40
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:32,780
"Soon, I shall be a warrior," he adds with
a sideways glance in Timucin's direction,

41
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,769
"although I shall never be a khan, of course."

42
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:39,829
He says these last words reproachfully.

43
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:44,010
"But this arrow..." says Timucin.

44
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,719
"I did not make it," interrupts Chuzir.

45
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,859
"It was old man Schezen who did the carving.

46
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:57,680
In return, I helped him collect firewood and
peat for three moons."

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,109
He looks at Timucin.

48
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,489
"Do you not like it?"

49
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:06,180
"Of course," says Timucin quickly, "it's wonderful.

50
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,999
But my own arrow is so..."

51
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:18,349
He stops, embarrassed, but Chuzir just laughs
and jabs him in the ribs so hard that Timucin

52
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:24,229
will start crying if he does not stop himself
with all the strength he has.

53
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:31,520
"That's not the point," says Chuzir, laughing,
"because you probably needed just as much

54
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,150
time to carve it as I spent helping that rip-off
merchant Schezen carry wood whilst he sat

55
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,080
by the fire keeping himself warm."

56
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,789
Perhaps that is true, thinks Timucin.

57
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:49,090
Nevertheless, he is ashamed of the gift.

58
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:56,210
If this were someone else, he would suspect
them of trying to embarrass him by making

59
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,090
such an exaggerated gift; but not Chuzir.

60
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:07,910
Chuzir is his best friend, his only friend
even - despite the fact that he is the khan's

61
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,910
son.

62
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,229
Or perhaps it is because he is the khan's
son...

63
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:22,849
"Come on," says Chuzir, jabbing him in the
ribs again, "let's go and try them out!"

64
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:30,490
Just the very idea of shooting this exquisite
arrow and perhaps damaging it fills Timucin

65
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:38,770
with horror, but Chuzir has already turned
on his heels and run off, so Timucin follows

66
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,770
him.

67
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:46,409
He runs as fast as he can, but he just cannot
keep up with Chuzir and will probably lose

68
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,289
him.

69
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:54,860
Chuzir sees that his best friend is having
trouble and slows down, then stops entirely.

70
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:01,599
Nevertheless, Timucin is completely out of
breath when he too gets to the top of the

71
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:02,599
hill.

72
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:07,229
Chuzir does not say anything, but he cannot
stop himself from grinning.

73
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:10,889
Not that he tries for one moment, either.

74
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:14,020
"I bet I get to the trees before you!"

75
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,180
Chuzir says.

76
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,930
He is not even breathing heavily, while Timucin's
lungs are burning like fire and his heart

77
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,389
is beating so hard he thinks it might burst.

78
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:28,759
"What a cheek!"

79
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,949
thinks Timucin to himself, and then he turns
to Chuzir.

80
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:38,270
"Why don't you just tell me what I have to
do for you?" he asks grumpily.

81
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,729
"After all, I shall have to do it anyway when
I lose the bet.

82
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:46,840
So I might just as well save my strength."

83
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,129
Chuzir grins and makes as if to jab him in
the ribs again, but he just runs around and

84
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:56,710
starts strolling towards the woods.

85
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:02,849
Timucin follows, cursing himself for what
he has just said.

86
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:06,680
Of course, Chuzir will never tell anyone anything
about it.

87
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,330
Timucin is his friend, after all, and they
are about to become brothers in oath.

88
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:19,229
Yet if one of the other boys has heard what
he has said, then it will just lead to more

89
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:21,319
rumours in the village.

90
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,189
And his father will not like that at all!

91
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:31,370
He will have to be more careful about what
he says.

92
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,909
The two young warriors reach the trees at
the same time.

93
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:42,110
Chuzir takes his bow from his shoulder, loads
it with Timucin's arrow and, inspecting it

94
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,870
closely, draws it halfway back.

95
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:51,379
There he holds it, waiting until Timucin too
has cocked his bow.

96
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:58,969
He nods the signal to shoot and then draws
back his bow in a movement as smooth as it

97
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:00,659
is strong.

98
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:03,150
"Forever," he says.

99
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,800
"Forever," echoes Timucin.

100
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,449
Their arrows fly off with a twin crack.

101
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:20,330
Despite being too short, bent and warped,
Timucin's arrow, sped by Chuzir's bowstring,

102
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:28,030
flies almost twice as far as the richly decorated
work of art that he himself has shot off.

103
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:34,039
It must have flown at least two hundred paces,
perhaps even three hundred, before burrowing

104
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,300
into the ground halfway between the trees
and the riverbank.

105
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:47,220
"Forever", says Chuzir once again; and this
time, too, Timucin echoes him.

106
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,820
Chuzir is beaming.

107
00:08:50,820 --> 00:09:00,660
A warm feeling comes over Timucin, accompanied
nevertheless by a strange feeling of emptiness,

108
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,339
almost of disappointment.

109
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,490
So now they are brothers in oath.

110
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:14,670
They have been talking about it since last
summer and have made preparations accordingly,

111
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:21,670
and somehow, he expected it to be... well,
more dramatic.

112
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:28,180
Taking an oath together is more than being
brothers by birth; it means being bound together

113
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:35,190
forever, being two parts of a whole who just
happen to live in two different bodies.

114
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:40,630
From this day forth, he will be willing to
give his life to protect his brother if need

115
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,110
be, and he expects this thought to be somehow...

116
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,699
elevating.

117
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:52,320
Shouldn't the earthquake and the heavens open?

118
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,040
Shouldn't there at least be a thunderclap
and a few flashes of lightning?

119
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,070
Yet there is nothing, of course.

120
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:05,870
Chuzir embraces him briefly and then turns
away brusquely.

121
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:11,040
"Let's go and get the arrows."

122
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:18,220
They do not run this time, but Chuzir has
almost twice as much ground to cover as Timucin

123
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:25,050
to reach his arrow and, for some reason, Timucin
does not want to follow him.

124
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:31,770
He pulls the precious arrow from the ground
and wipes it down carefully.

125
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:38,279
Suddenly he has an intense feeling of being
watched.

126
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,370
Perhaps the other young warriors had found
out what they were doing?

127
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,990
Timucin turns round and stiffens.

128
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,940
His hunch is true.

129
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:56,690
Except that he is not just being watched,
he is being stalked.

130
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:03,960
It's a dog, almost as big as a foal, but far
heavier.

131
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:11,290
It is a shaggy-coated monstrosity with huge
teeth, dripping with yellow slaver.

132
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:18,839
And it is standing about ten paces behind
him at the edge of the forest, staring at

133
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,519
him.

134
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,820
Timucin can feel his heart faltering.

135
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:30,389
He hates dogs and is afraid of them more than
anything else in the world.

136
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:35,961
He grips the arrow tighter, but, although
his life might now depend on it, something

137
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:41,490
seems to be stopping him from drawing the
bowstring.

138
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,450
The dog might kill him.

139
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:51,069
Perhaps it does not want to, but it can - and
this thought is more than he can bear.

140
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:53,029
"Timucin, shoot!"

141
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:59,589
cries Chuzir at almost the same moment as
he releases his bowstring.

142
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:05,300
The arrow whizzes past Timucin's cheek, stroking
him with its feathers.

143
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:11,579
As the arrow hits the ground just over a man's
length away from the dog, it lets out a frightened

144
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:16,220
yelp and runs off with its tail between its
legs.

145
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,579
"Timucin, shoot!"

146
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:22,790
shouts Chuzir again, "What are you waiting
for?"

147
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:32,199
Timucin hears Chuzir's steps and sees the
huge dog bolting like a hare towards the trees

148
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:34,600
and disappearing into the undergrowth.

149
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:42,610
Chuzir reaches him, tears the arrow from his
fingers and, faster than Timucin's eyes can

150
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,899
follow, loads it into his bow.

151
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:49,060
He draws the string back behind his ear and
then...

152
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,830
He lets out a moan as he drops the bow.

153
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,600
The dog is gone.

154
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,170
"Why did you do that?" he asks angrily.

155
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,210
"Why didn't you shoot?"

156
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,930
"Because, er, because the arrow..."

157
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,730
stutters Timucin.

158
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:19,060
Chuzir looks at him with a frown and Timucin
continues to speak, with a nervous smile.

159
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:25,130
"I was afraid of breaking it, as it is so
valuable..."

160
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:31,990
This only makes Chuzir angrier, but he says
nothing more, pressing his lips together out

161
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:37,649
of rage and stomping off past him to fetch
his dart.

162
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:42,660
Timucin knows what will happen in the night.

163
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,790
The dragon will come to him and show him what
he has missed.

164
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,790
CHAPTER TWO
The Dream Dragon

165
00:13:52,790 --> 00:14:00,000
Timucin goes to bed unusually early this evening.

166
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,100
Most evenings, his mother has to tell him
to go and leave the men to sit round the fire

167
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,639
in peace, as is their right.

168
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,990
All too often, he stays up until his father
puts his foot down.

169
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:22,180
Only then does he do as he is told and goes
into his little yurt, pitched right next to

170
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,010
his father's tent.

171
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,139
He has been sleeping alone here since last
summer.

172
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:32,889
Today, however, he cannot wait to go.

173
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:39,740
He gulps down his dinner, makes an excuse
and goes to bed before sunset.

174
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:47,149
As is always the case when trying to sleep,
it takes a long time for him to sink into

175
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:48,730
slumber.

176
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,560
He has barely fallen asleep when Sarantuya
comes to him.

177
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,420
Just like every time, Timucin feels her presence
more than he sees it.

178
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,160
Well, in the first moments in any case.

179
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:15,260
It is something big, infinitely soft but also
infinitely old and strong that steals into

180
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,871
his dreams and only slowly takes on a form.

181
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:23,819
"I haven't seen you for a while," he says.

182
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:30,160
"I didn't feel that you needed me," answers
Sarantuya.

183
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,629
The shadowy figure in his dream starts to
become clearer.

184
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:46,019
At the edge of his consciousness, something
big, something ancient stirs, glinting like

185
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,639
moonlight on silver scales.

186
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,899
It touches his soul.

187
00:15:52,899 --> 00:16:00,980
He feels warmth and comfort and thinks he
almost sees something.

188
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,769
Almost.

189
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:07,910
"Why did you do that?" asks Timucin.

190
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:16,220
Sarantuya squints, as the moonlight in the
dream breaks on her scales and then flows

191
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:26,860
down her flanks, jingling lightly as if, somewhere
far away, a thousand cymbals are being struck.

192
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:34,029
It is always night in Timucin's dreams when
Sarantuya comes to him, and there is always

193
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:35,959
a full moon.

194
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,870
He has stopped being surprised by it.

195
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,509
"What did you say?"

196
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:43,420
she asks him.

197
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:52,829
Timucin has to force himself not to get angry;
despite her huge claws and sharp fangs, Sarantuya

198
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:58,329
hates strong feelings like anger and fury.

199
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:03,730
She is the most peaceful creature Timucin
has ever come across.

200
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:11,690
"You know very well what I mean," he says,
just managing to keep control of himself.

201
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,110
"That dog!

202
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,730
Why did you stop Chuzir killing it?"

203
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:23,740
"Did I?" replies Sarantuya, pretending to
be surprised.

204
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,950
Then she laughs quietly.

205
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:33,400
It sounds like thunder rolling in the mountains
on the horizon.

206
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,480
"What if your friend Chuzir just missed?"

207
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
"Nonsense!"

208
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,500
replies Timucin.

209
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,210
"Chuzir is the best shot I know.

210
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,370
He never misses his target!"

211
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,950
"Not even with a bent arrow?"

212
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,740
says Sarantuya mockingly.

213
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,720
Timucin ignores this comment.

214
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,570
"He never misses his target," he insists.

215
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:10,070
"Well then, it must be that somebody wanted
him to miss," says Sarantuya, smirking.

216
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,550
"You."

217
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:17,270
"No," says the dragon, suddenly in a very
serious tone of voice.

218
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:23,230
"I would never do anything you do not want,
and you know it."

219
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,210
Timucin says nothing more.

220
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,470
Chuzir said nothing after missing.

221
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,700
He simply walked on for a few moments, offended.

222
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:40,000
The way he looked at Timucin showed that he
knew exactly who he blamed for his unusual

223
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,370
failure.

224
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,140
Perhaps Chuzir actually knows that it is Timucin's
fault.

225
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:53,890
Timucin has already told him once about his
dream dragon, but Chuzir's reaction was such

226
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,580
that Timucin has never mentioned it again.

227
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:04,350
It was years ago now, and Timucin does not
know if Chuzir remembers it at all, but you

228
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,220
just never know.

229
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:13,020
"You didn't really want to kill the dog,"
continues Sarantuya after a while.

230
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,260
"But I was afraid of him", answers Timucin.

231
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:25,050
"I know," says Sarantuya with a sigh, "but
you don't need to kill every-thing you are

232
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,050
afraid of.

233
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,480
Do you remember the first time you saw me?"

234
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,070
"Of course I do!"

235
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,310
"You were afraid of me, too."

236
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:41,870
"No, I wasn't," claims Timucin, although this
is a downright lie.

237
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:48,470
He almost died of fright the first time the
dragon appeared to him in a dream.

238
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:55,380
"So," continues Sarantuya, "did you want to
kill me because of that?"

239
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,330
"Of course not!"

240
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,260
answers Timucin, outraged.

241
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,270
"I would never..."

242
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:09,020
"... kill anything that hasn't done you any
harm," says Sarantuya, finishing his sentence

243
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,060
for him.

244
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,220
"I know.

245
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:17,760
If it were any different, I would never have
come to you."

246
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,320
Timucin does not really understand what she
is saying, but he isn't in the mood to ask

247
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,390
questions.

248
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,220
Sarantuya says many odd things that he does
not understand.

249
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:36,240
"What do you want?" he asks reluctantly.

250
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:46,630
For once, Timucin's anger seems to amuse Sarantuya,
perhaps because she too feels that, in reality,

251
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,370
it is only directed against himself.

252
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:56,850
"Really, it should be me asking you these
questions," she answers.

253
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:06,530
"If I remember correctly, you were the one
who called me, and not the other way round.

254
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,920
Since I'm here anyway...

255
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,070
Tomorrow is a big day for you.

256
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,650
A very important day."

257
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,240
Timucin thinks as hard as he can.

258
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,860
Tomorrow?

259
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,480
Tomorrow?

260
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,830
"How so?" he asks, skeptically.

261
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:36,660
"It's a surprise!" says Sarantuya, teasing
him.

262
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,080
"You will meet someone.

263
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,950
Someone who will become very important to
you."

264
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,570
"Who?" asks Timucin.

265
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:52,420
Yet Sarantuya does not even answer.

266
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:59,670
She disappears with a silvery, bright laugh.

267
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:05,150
CHAPTER THREE
The Warrior

268
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:11,940
His father Tamer wakes him the following morning
before the sun has come up.

269
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:18,300
This is nothing unusual: most people in the
village get up before dawn, and only very

270
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,690
rarely does Timucin sleep past sunrise.

271
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:30,070
If he does, it is mostly when his father has
been up too long drinking or discussing matters

272
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:34,200
with the other men - both of which have the
same result.

273
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:43,300
What is unusual, however, is his father's
grumpy mood and his even grumpier face.

274
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:50,050
This is the first thing Timucin sees as he
opens his eyes.

275
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:56,890
Tamer is a great warrior, no doubt, who has
killed many enemies and brought the tribe

276
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,490
to respect and riches.

277
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:08,530
But at the bottom of his heart, he is a friendly
man, a gentle one, especially where his son

278
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,850
is concerned.

279
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:14,740
This morning, however, he is not at all gentle.

280
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:22,590
In fact, he seems furious as he grasps his
son's shoulder and shakes him roughly to wake

281
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,590
him.

282
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:32,710
If Timucin were not as sleepy, he would understand
that his father really is furious.

283
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:39,430
He rubs his eyes and looks astonished as his
father goes back to the small entrance to

284
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,350
the tent and motions him to follow.

285
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:49,420
Just like every morning, they look after the
horses and drive the sheep onto the pasture

286
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,340
without saying a single word to one another.

287
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:00,480
Then they go down to the river to wash themselves
in the icy waters of the Omon.

288
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,010
Then his father breaks the uncomfortable silence.

289
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:14,580
"Chuzir told me about the dog," he says, his
voice full of reproach.

290
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,720
Timucin looks at him.

291
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:26,380
He is not quite sure what Chuzir has told
his father, and so saying nothing is probably

292
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,540
the cleverest thing to do.

293
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,100
His father sighs deeply.

294
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:40,380
"When are you going to finally become a man,
my son?" he asks.

295
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:48,070
"You are my only son, Timucin, and one day
you will take my place and become khan.

296
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:55,400
But how will you be able to do that if you
are still a mere boy?"

297
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,340
Timucin does not answer.

298
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:04,840
His father does not want an answer, he can
feel this, and this is not the first time

299
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,490
they have had this talk.

300
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:14,630
Tamer may not yet have said it as directly
as he has now, but Timucin knows very well

301
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:22,340
that it is a great source of pain to him that
his only son will not grow into the great

302
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,050
warrior he wants him to be.

303
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:35,920
Timucin may be a passable bowman, may be good
rider, and may just about know how to handle

304
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,870
a sword and shield, but that is not enough.

305
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:45,690
The other boys are better than he is, even
the younger ones.

306
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:53,150
It is not so much a question of his ability,
his skill or even his courage.

307
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,360
It is just that he doesn't like weapons.

308
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,510
He has never really understood where the glow
in the eyes of the warriors comes from when

309
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,300
they speak of all the enemies they have slain.

310
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:15,820
"Chuzir told me," says his father, picking
up where he left off, "that you were scared

311
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,850
stiff of the dog as it stood in front of you."

312
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,610
"It was a very big dog..."

313
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:29,740
answers Timucin, "and it was very dangerous."

314
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:36,290
This must have been the wrong answer, because
Tamer's face becomes even darker.

315
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:40,940
"Did it attack you?" he asks.

316
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,910
Timucin keeps silent.

317
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:52,410
His father turns suddenly and walks back towards
the village with such big strides that Timucin

318
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,130
has to struggle not to fall back.

319
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,070
His father does not look at him as he starts
talking again.

320
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:06,220
"Dogs, Timucin, are, after horses, our most
loyal friends.

321
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:11,390
They help us to watch our sheep, to keep our
food supplies free of rats, and they warm

322
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,540
us in winter when the fire no longer burns
enough.

323
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,780
There is no need to be afraid of them!"

324
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,950
"But it was growling at me!" says Timucin
in his defence.

325
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:30,000
He is not sure if this was actually the case,
and it is clearly not the answer that Tamer

326
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,470
wants, because now he is really furious.

327
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:38,380
"But it didn't attack you, did it?

328
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:43,580
And even if it had, you would have had to
have killed it like a warrior.

329
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,550
You had your bow with you, didn't you?"

330
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:52,570
"Yes," answers Timucin dejectedly, "I am sorry,
father."

331
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,130
"Be silent!"

332
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,680
shouts Tamer.

333
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,040
"You are the son of a khan!

334
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,820
You shall never say you are sorry to anyone
about anything!

335
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,950
Not even to me!

336
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,870
If you make a mistake, be sure not to do it
again.

337
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,350
But never apologise!"

338
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,400
"Yes father," replies Timucin.

339
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,610
He almost adds "I am sorry".

340
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:24,370
They cover the rest of the way back to the
village in silence.

341
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:31,830
As they reach it over the hill, the village
is now wide-awake and busy at work.

342
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:40,280
They hear children shouting, an ox mooing
and, in the distance, the thunder of horses'

343
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,710
hooves.

344
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:48,050
When they get to Tamer's yurt, which, as is
his right, is the biggest in the village,

345
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:54,970
big enough to take in all the men in the entire
tribe, they find it empty.

346
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:02,760
This is unusual, and Timucin wants to leave
the tent and go about his daily work, which

347
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,490
he has now neglected too long.

348
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:12,900
But Tamer calls him back with a lordly movement
of his hand and gestures to him to stand in

349
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,930
the middle of the tent.

350
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:20,170
Timucin is confused, but obeys his father.

351
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,500
His heart is beating hard.

352
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,270
He has been hoping that this is all over,
but it seems that his father has not finished

353
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,340
yet.

354
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,140
Perhaps what Tamer has just said is only the
beginning?

355
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:42,700
His heart starts to beat even faster, and
he clenches his fists so that his father does

356
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,000
not see how badly his fingers are shaking.

357
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,810
Tamer is moving around behind him, and Timucin
asks himself what he is actually doing.

358
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:01,960
He does not dare to turn around, but keeps
staring at the ashes of the fire.

359
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:08,640
Finally, his father returns and throws something
to the ground in front of him.

360
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:17,320
It takes Timucin a while to recognise it as
the full outfit and weaponry of a warrior.

361
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:26,740
There is a leather tunic and belt, a fine-woven
chainmail shirt, boots with artfully engraved

362
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:36,300
metal plates, a breastplate and shield, a
precious bronze helmet and a broad, decorated

363
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,970
weapon-belt, wrapped around a beautifully
forged sword.

364
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:46,410
There is everything he needs to be a warrior.

365
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,270
"Put it on!" says Tamer.

366
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:56,400
Timucin obeys his father, but he is becoming
more and more nervous.

367
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:02,890
He knows of the existence of warriors' clothing
because Tamer has told him about it.

368
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:11,310
His father always stresses that it is reserved
for very special occasions, and Timucin has

369
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,790
never seen it before.

370
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:21,850
He does not dare ask questions but looks quizzically
at his father while putting on the outfit.

371
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,360
Finally, Tamer breaks the silence himself.

372
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:36,210
"Today is a special day," he begins and watches
closely every movement Timucin's nervous hands

373
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:41,070
make, "and I want you to make a good impression.

374
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:48,480
Behave yourself and do not bring shame upon
our clan or upon me, your father.

375
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:56,200
And do not worry: I have told our warriors
to chase all the dogs out of the village until

376
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,370
our visitor has left."

377
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:05,760
Timucin feels his ears going red and sinks
his head in shame.

378
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,820
"Who is coming to visit?" he asks nonetheless.

379
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:19,250
"My brother in oath, Belmin, the khan of the
Voshon tribe," answers Tamer.

380
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,100
"Have you heard of them?"

381
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,610
"Yes father," answers Timucin quietly.

382
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,140
The Voshon?

383
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:34,640
Of course, he has heard of them, as well as
of Belmin, their wise and mighty khan.

384
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,560
Belmin became his father's brother in oath
when he and Tamer were the same age as Timucin

385
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,200
and Chuzir are now.

386
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:50,570
The Voshon tribe has far more land than Tamer's
tribe and is much, much richer.

387
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:58,720
It is told that their herds are so big that,
if all their horses were to be driven together

388
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,110
at once, they would cover the steppe from
horizon to horizon.

389
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:10,570
The khan's yurt is said to be covered in pure
gold.

390
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:17,930
Despite this wealth and power, it is told
that they are a very peaceful tribe, and many

391
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:25,120
warriors laugh at them - as long as Tamer
is not around to defend the honour of his

392
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,820
brother in oath.

393
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:33,290
Timucin buckles his sword-belt and then reaches
for the last item, his helmet.

394
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:40,710
He thinks for a moment about whether to put
it on now, but then decides against this and

395
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,200
puts it under his left arm.

396
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:51,170
His father eyes him for a moment, looks him
up and down and then nods his approval.

397
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:57,030
"And what is so important about this visit
for me?" asks Timucin.

398
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,880
"Who am I meeting?"

399
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:06,970
Tamer looks at him surprised, and Timucin
wants to slap himself in the face for having

400
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,679
asked this question.

401
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,980
It is Sarantuya who has told him that he will
meet somebody who will affect his future,

402
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,809
not his father.

403
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:18,320
He has said nothing.

404
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:26,899
He looks at Timucin for two or three heartbeats
in a way that makes Timucin really very uncomfortable.

405
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:37,179
Then, however, he answers his son's question:
"You are old enough now, my son, and soon

406
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,389
you will be a man.

407
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:43,260
It is time to find you a wife."

408
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,299
"A wife?"

409
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:49,389
Timucin is beyond surprised.

410
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:55,349
He was ready for anything, just not that.

411
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:56,349
"But..."

412
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:04,539
"You are old enough, my boy," interrupts Tamer,
"at your age, I was already married.

413
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:08,720
Belmin is bringing his daughter, Arbesa.

414
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:16,589
She is just one year younger than you and,
so I have heard tell, very beautiful.

415
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:22,349
And of course a link between our tribes would
be to everyone's advantage."

416
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:29,550
"But I don't know this girl at all," protests
Timucin.

417
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:35,509
As he has expected, his father's face darkens.

418
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:43,559
Moments later, however, a sudden and unusually
gentle smile spreads across his face.

419
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:53,010
"Son, I would never force you to marry anyone
you do not want to, but have a look at her

420
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,190
at least.

421
00:35:54,190 --> 00:36:00,609
I ask for no more than that, and perhaps you
will like her.

422
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:05,799
She will definitely like you, I'm very sure
of that."

423
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:14,140
Timucin looks quizzically as Tamer stops talking
and bends down to pick up a polished silver

424
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,619
plate left from the previous evening's feast.

425
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:25,140
There are streaks of dried sheep's milk and
bits of food stuck to it, but Timucin can

426
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:31,650
still see his own reflection in the mirror
and understands what his father means.

427
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:39,470
He really does look like a warrior, magnificently
equipped and wild, with his hair braided his

428
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:43,910
strong features and his lively, light blue
eyes.

429
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:50,460
Who would be able to resist him looking like
this?

430
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:57,720
Timucin is about to make a jokey remark about
this when he thinks he feels movement behind

431
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,390
him.

432
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:09,800
It is a kind of golden shimmering, like moonlight
breaking on polished scales.

433
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:17,230
He quickly checks behind himself, but sees
nothing.

434
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:25,400
When he looks back at the plate, however,
he sees Sarantuya reflected behind him, this

435
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,710
time even more clearly than in his dream.

436
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:39,170
She looks at him and she too sees the warrior,
which this wonderful armour, sword and helmet

437
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,410
have made him into.

438
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:47,230
The big gold dragon looks sad.

439
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:54,029
CHAPTER FOUR
New Arrival

440
00:37:54,029 --> 00:37:59,980
Belmin does not come until the sun is well
past its highest point.

441
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:08,160
Nevertheless, as befits someone of his rank,
he travels with a large entourage.

442
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,450
Several riders have arrived before him to
give advance notice of his arrival.

443
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:17,609
The whole village gathers to welcome him fittingly.

444
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:25,309
Timucin of course has a place in the first
row, right next to his father and the other

445
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:26,309
warriors.

446
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:32,460
However, Timucin does not start towards the
group until the baggage train can be seen

447
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,470
on the hills in the West.

448
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:42,869
He is not in much of a hurry to get there,
and in even less of a hurry to meet either

449
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:48,839
his father's brother in oath, or his daughter.

450
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:54,589
He has got nothing against girls and knows
as well as the next man that the children

451
00:38:54,589 --> 00:39:01,700
of tribal chiefs get married to each other
in order to increase their power and to secure

452
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,960
an often all too insecure peace.

453
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,579
He should not be surprised that his turn has
now come.

454
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:17,609
He has simply believed that he has a little
more time - perhaps another summer, maybe

455
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:18,609
two.

456
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:22,500
Of course, he will not dare to defy his father.

457
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:29,190
But he has mixed feelings about this meeting
with his father's brother in oath and, above

458
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,599
all, the daughter.

459
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:40,269
As befits their status, the other boys, including
Chuzir, wait at an appropriate distance behind

460
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:44,820
the warriors and the elders, yet in front
of the women still.

461
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:52,369
Timucin has to walk past them in order to
join his father on time.

462
00:39:52,369 --> 00:40:00,180
He ignores the other boys as usual, but greets
Chuzir and is about to set off even faster.

463
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:09,140
Yet he notices Chuzir's dark expression of
face and turns round to him, his brow furrowed

464
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,230
quizzically.

465
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:15,609
Chuzir avoids his gaze and turns away.

466
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:21,609
"What is wrong?" asks Timucin bluntly.

467
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:23,460
He is confused.

468
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,390
"Nothing," replies Chuzir curtly.

469
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:34,920
Timucin stretches his hand out so as to seize
him by the shoulder, but Chuzir steps back

470
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,180
quickly and Timucin pulls back his arm.

471
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:49,049
He feels a faint but deep stabbing pain in
his chest: Chuzir is his brother in oath!

472
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:56,460
"You must hurry, Timucin," says one of the
other boys, "otherwise you, our future Khan,

473
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,670
will arrive too late to greet your bride."

474
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:05,720
Timucin flashes his eyes at the boy, but does
not say anything.

475
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:12,630
Ilhan, the boy, is two heads taller than him
and doesn't like him.

476
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:19,470
Timucin dislikes him too, and feels that he
will have to fight him one day.

477
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:27,769
Yet he does not want it to be now, so he offers
Ilhan nothing more than a contemptuous look

478
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:29,890
and makes to go on.

479
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:34,630
Ilhan, however, continues in a mocking tone.

480
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,759
"Don't you worry!

481
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:43,329
We will make sure that nothing else gets in
the way of our future khan and his bride.

482
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:45,869
Woof woof!"

483
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:53,569
This comment was followed by laughter from
all around, and Timucin feels a sudden fury,

484
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:58,999
so strong that he wants to jump at the bigger
boy and pummel him.

485
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:06,910
Yet his fury dies away as quickly as it comes,
and gives way to something very different

486
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:10,950
and much, much worse.

487
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:18,580
His eyes fill with burning tears, and he turns
back to Chuzir.

488
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:24,019
He steps so close to him that no one else
can hear him speak.

489
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:30,180
"Why did you tell them about it?" he whispers.

490
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,570
His voice is shaking.

491
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:36,410
Chuzir avoids his gaze again.

492
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:44,519
Timucin waits for him to answer the question,
but he says nothing, so Timucin turns away

493
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:49,400
angry and walks away as quickly as he can
without running.

494
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,619
Behind him, the boys are laughing and a few
of them bark again.

495
00:42:55,619 --> 00:43:03,599
Timucin keeps his back turned to them, but
it costs him all the strength he has to hold

496
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,249
back the tears.

497
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:12,340
His father seems very angry when he arrives
next to him, but he does not have the time

498
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:18,549
to say anything to him because, in that moment,
the baggage train is coming by.

499
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:26,740
Tamer simply looks at his son angrily in a
way that seems to promise punishment later.

500
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:33,249
Then he straightens his shoulders and gets
ready to greet his guests.

501
00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:41,309
Belmin is an older, white-haired man with
a white beard that reaches his chest.

502
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:49,029
He has a weather-beaten face and exudes an
aura of dignity and power that you can almost

503
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:51,859
reach out and grasp.

504
00:43:51,859 --> 00:44:01,059
Timucin has often met men who have great power
(including his father, of course), but Belmin

505
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:08,970
differs from them in one important point:
he is the first chief he has ever met who

506
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:12,200
does not carry a weapon.

507
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,980
His large entourage, too, is mostly unarmed.

508
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:24,680
Just the two knight's right and left of him
have spears held upright in their hands, and

509
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:31,000
it looks to Timucin somehow as if they only
have them to tie their pennants to, which

510
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,550
are fluttering above their heads in the wind.

511
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:42,749
Tamer greets his noble guest effusively, using
the complicated and wordy greetings common

512
00:44:42,749 --> 00:44:44,999
to his people.

513
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:51,640
Timucin uses this time to have a closer look
at the many people accompanying the khan of

514
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,529
the Voshon.

515
00:44:53,529 --> 00:45:00,410
Of course, there is a very particular person
he is looking for, and he finds her a little

516
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:09,609
behind Belmin, flanked by two knights who,
contrary to his first impressions, are heavily

517
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:10,799
armed.

518
00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:21,310
She is slender, wrapped up in exquisite garments,
and about a hand shorter than him.

519
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:27,220
She has to be Arbesa, his future wife.

520
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:35,740
Her face is veiled, so he cannot quite recognise
its features, but he thinks he sees her keen

521
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:40,460
stare through the material and quickly looks
away.

522
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:46,670
The greeting ceremony goes on for quite some
time, but eventually it is over and Belmin

523
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:53,069
makes a brief gesture, allowing his entourage
to sit.

524
00:45:53,069 --> 00:46:00,210
Milk as well as other, stronger drinks are
offered, along with a meal, and suddenly the

525
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:07,130
ceremonial silence, previously broken only
by the exchange of formalities between the

526
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:14,619
khans, gives way to general laughter and pats
on the shoulder as the more than thirty riders

527
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:18,460
start to mix with the population of the village.

528
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:27,289
Arbesa, too, slips down from her horse with
a smooth movement, yet Timucin does not find

529
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:33,009
the right moment to approach her or even to
look at her.

530
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:41,220
Tamer puts his hand on his shoulder and pushes
him in between himself and Belmin.

531
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:46,740
"This my son, Timucin," he says.

532
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:54,339
The old khan looks at him with his strangely
soft eyes for a few instants.

533
00:46:54,339 --> 00:47:01,700
Despite the tangible aura of softness and
goodness he exudes, Timucin - who is already

534
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:07,089
very uncomfortable - is almost afraid of him.

535
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:11,490
Then the khan smiles suddenly.

536
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:20,970
"So you are Timucin," he says, "I have heard
a lot about you.

537
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:28,070
I am told that you are a son who is every
bit as honorable as his father.

538
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,839
Is this true?"

539
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:36,519
Timucin does not know what to answer and simply
lowers his head in shame.

540
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:41,289
In this situation, this is almost an insult.

541
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:47,109
Tamer is horrified and sucks in air sharply
past his teeth.

542
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:52,650
Belmin, however, just laughs, quietly and
benevolently.

543
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:59,609
"Well, I see he really is his father's son.

544
00:47:59,609 --> 00:48:05,089
My brother in oath was never one for too many
words."

545
00:48:05,089 --> 00:48:14,539
Tamer laughs, but even his laugh sounds hollow,
and he puts another hand on Timucin's shoulder.

546
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:24,339
It is as if he is showing Timucin off as his
own property, and Timucin finds this degrading.

547
00:48:24,339 --> 00:48:28,680
He does not say anything, however, and keeps
looking for Arbesa.

548
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:37,359
The girl has already gone past him, without
even looking at him, as it seems to him, and

549
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,430
is now talking with the women.

550
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:46,089
The men of the tribe, too, have mingled with
the village people, and are eating, joking

551
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,579
and drinking with them.

552
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:52,710
The big reception has dissolved into nothing.

553
00:48:52,710 --> 00:49:01,240
Only his father and his father's brother in
oath are still standing, trying to look important,

554
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,579
but they are clearly not succeeding.

555
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:13,319
Tamer clearly finds the situation embarrassing;
Belmin looks amused by it all.

556
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:19,470
Finally, he clears his throat and gestures
towards the big yurt in the middle of the

557
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,470
village.

558
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:26,009
"It was a long and tiring journey, old friend,
and I am thirsty.

559
00:49:26,009 --> 00:49:32,799
We have not seen each other for many years
and have much to talk about."

560
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:37,730
And talk they did.

561
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:42,660
CHAPTER FIVE
Arbesa

562
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:49,839
Having gone to bed so early the evening before,
Timucin ends up going to bed very late tonight.

563
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:57,950
A huge feast is being given in honour of the
guests, starting just before sundown and going

564
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:02,119
on until far past midnight.

565
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:09,420
Almost all of the clansmen are in Tamer's
tent, eating, talking and drinking.

566
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:15,339
The women are barely able to keep up with
serving food and drinks.

567
00:50:15,339 --> 00:50:21,609
With all the delicious food, and with the
hours that pass, the feasting becomes ever

568
00:50:21,609 --> 00:50:26,359
more boisterous, and the men's tongues become
looser.

569
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:33,529
The camp echoes to the sounds of laughter
and music and the happy voices of the men

570
00:50:33,529 --> 00:50:38,839
as they try to outdo each other with amazing
stories.

571
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:44,150
Everyone knows that only half of the stories
are actually true, but that does not stop

572
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:49,249
them being listened to intently and greatly
enjoyed.

573
00:50:49,249 --> 00:50:55,980
Timucin spends the feast sitting at his father's
right-hand side, listening to the stories

574
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:03,339
that the clansmen are so happily embellishing,
but he cannot fully concentrate on the proceedings.

575
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:10,970
His gaze keeps wandering over to the veiled
girl next to Belmin, and when he is not looking

576
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:17,119
at her, he thinks he can feel her eyes on
him.

577
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,980
At the beginning, it is an unpleasant feeling.

578
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:28,950
He does not like being stared at without being
able to see the face of the person staring.

579
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:34,339
After a while, however, it just feels slightly
odd.

580
00:51:34,339 --> 00:51:39,269
He is curious to have a look behind the veil.

581
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:45,130
But apart from the fact that this is not the
done thing, he doesn't allow himself to make

582
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,130
such a request.

583
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:55,299
It is long past midnight when, from outside
the yurt, they hear the typical sound of swords

584
00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:56,960
clashing.

585
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,619
Tamer stops talking to his brother in oath
without finishing his sentence and then jumps

586
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,069
up and hurries out of the tent.

587
00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:11,289
Everyone else, including Belmin and of course
Timucin, follow suit.

588
00:52:11,289 --> 00:52:17,579
Outside the tent, a fight is going on between
one of Arbesa's bodyguards and a man from

589
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:22,690
the village; at least, that is the way it
seems at first.

590
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:30,210
Swords clash and spray sparks, light breaks
on shimmering metal and the links in chainmail

591
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:31,790
vests.

592
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:39,160
The two men seem to be carrying out a bizarre
and speedy dance around each other, exercising

593
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:46,509
themselves in sword-fighting techniques like
parries and feints whilst the blades smash

594
00:52:46,509 --> 00:52:48,279
into their shields.

595
00:52:48,279 --> 00:52:56,010
No blood has yet been spilled, as Timucin
quickly recognizes, and none will be: the

596
00:52:56,010 --> 00:53:00,339
two men are laughing as they fight.

597
00:53:00,339 --> 00:53:07,000
Arbesa's bodyguard could land a hit on the
leg of the man fighting him, but turns the

598
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,140
blade at the last moment so that it hits him
flat.

599
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:15,130
This hurts, but is not dangerous.

600
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:22,369
The onlookers whoop and clap whilst Ilhan's
father - as Timucin recognizes him, uncomfortably

601
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:30,180
- hops around on one leg swearing, and then
lunges at his opponent all the more bitterly.

602
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:37,460
Timucin too suddenly hears himself cheering
on the two fighters as he hears a high-pitched

603
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,970
voice next to him.

604
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:44,220
"What do you men find so exciting about playing
war?"

605
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,960
"Well, because it's just..." says Timucin.

606
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,809
Then he stops himself in mid flow and turns
round to see who has said this.

607
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:59,269
It is Arbesa.

608
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:05,799
She has removed her veil and is looking down
at the two fighters with an expression somewhere

609
00:54:05,799 --> 00:54:10,160
between quizzical and derogatory.

610
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,759
She has the most beautiful face that Timucin
has ever seen.

611
00:54:15,759 --> 00:54:17,190
"Yes...?"

612
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:20,210
she asks, turning round to him.

613
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:27,890
Timucin looks into her crys-tal-clear, almost
uncannily light eyes.

614
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:36,710
These eyes awaken something in him whose existence
he has not known until that moment.

615
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:41,170
It is as if his throat has been tied up.

616
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:46,170
"Well, because it's... er..." he stutters.

617
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:52,720
Arbesa's eyes flash in a way that can only
be described as scoffing.

618
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,920
"I understand.

619
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:00,180
'Because men just do that kind of thing',
right?"

620
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,180
She laughs.

621
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,619
"We all know that.

622
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:05,279
The question is why?"

623
00:55:05,279 --> 00:55:11,849
"In order to measure their strength and be
ready when they come up against the enemy,"

624
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:14,609
answers Timucin automatically.

625
00:55:14,609 --> 00:55:22,140
He feels stupid, and Arbesa probably thinks
he is stupid too, because the scorn in her

626
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,739
eyes continues to grow.

627
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:26,619
"The enemy?"

628
00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:27,910
she repeats.

629
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:30,030
"Which enemy?"

630
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:35,240
Before Timucin has the chance to answer, she
does it herself.

631
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,400
"It doesn't matter much.

632
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,339
There's always an enemy around, isn't there?"

633
00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:46,180
Her eyes look at Timucin as intently as if
she were looking at him for the very first

634
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,230
time.

635
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:53,849
Something in her gaze stabs at Timucin's heart
like a thin needle.

636
00:55:53,849 --> 00:56:03,030
"You too look like a real warrior, but perhaps
a little small," she says and covers her face

637
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:10,589
back up with her veil, turns around abruptly
and walks back to the yurt with quick steps.

638
00:56:10,589 --> 00:56:17,579
Timucin looks confused and hears a cheerful
peal of laughter behind him.

639
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:25,609
A hand comes down on his shoulder and, as
he looks up, he is looking directly into Belmin's

640
00:56:25,609 --> 00:56:27,670
bearded face.

641
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:31,859
The old khan smiles, almost mischievously.

642
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:38,710
"Yes, well, you've met my daughter now, then,"
he says.

643
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:41,559
"Do you still like her?"

644
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:51,789
Timucin says nothing - what can he say? - and
just looks up at Belmin, taken aback.

645
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:58,779
He takes his hand off of Timucin's shoulder
and motions with his head for Timucin to follow

646
00:56:58,779 --> 00:56:59,779
him.

647
00:56:59,779 --> 00:57:02,990
"Come, let us step together."

648
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:09,760
Timucin looks helplessly at the two fighters;
they have not come anywhere near finishing,

649
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,819
and yet it is a question of the honour of
the tribe.

650
00:57:13,819 --> 00:57:20,549
That does not seem to bother the old khan,
however, who walks off slowly, away from the

651
00:57:20,549 --> 00:57:25,640
light and shouts and noise of the friendly
tussle.

652
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,259
Timucin is not sure how long it will stay
friendly.

653
00:57:30,259 --> 00:57:35,509
He knows Ilhan's father well, and he does
not like losing.

654
00:57:35,509 --> 00:57:43,150
"Please do not be upset at Arbesa," says Belmin
once they have walked a while.

655
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:48,790
"She is still young and speaks freely and
from the heart.

656
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:52,059
She will soon learn to consider her words
better."

657
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:59,019
"I am not upset at her," says Timucin hurriedly,
"she is a girl, after all."

658
00:57:59,019 --> 00:58:02,549
"And very pretty one, eh?"

659
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:04,819
adds the father.

660
00:58:04,819 --> 00:58:08,250
Timucin feels himself going red.

661
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:15,079
He does not know why, but he lowers his head
and hopes that Belmin does not notice.

662
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:22,740
"She is still a child," continues the old
khan in an amused tone of voice, from which

663
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:29,869
Timucin understands that he has noticed his
blush, "but we can see that she will soon

664
00:58:29,869 --> 00:58:32,319
be a good-looking young woman.

665
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,920
If she takes after her mother, she will be
a real beauty.

666
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:42,609
By the same token, she will be fiercely independent."

667
00:58:42,609 --> 00:58:43,609
He laughs.

668
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:48,609
"You can think yourself lucky to get a woman
of her calibre.

669
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:51,640
If you want her."

670
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:59,470
He stands still and examines Timucin with
a changed, but still not unfriendly gaze.

671
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,680
"So, do you want her?"

672
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,930
"But of course!"

673
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,019
answers Timucin hastily.

674
00:59:07,019 --> 00:59:08,410
"My father..."

675
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:16,239
"... has told you how important this alliance
is for our two tribes, and how I am his oldest

676
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:19,769
and best friend and his brother in oath.

677
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:25,609
The important thing, however, is what you
and Arbesa want.

678
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:29,390
Do you want this to happen?"

679
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:38,229
Timucin does not answer straight away and,
when he does, he answers so openly that he

680
00:59:38,229 --> 00:59:39,940
surprises himself.

681
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,499
"I do not know, my lord.

682
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:47,020
I mean, I do not know her yet.

683
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,160
She is very pretty, but..."

684
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,560
"I understand," sighs Belmin.

685
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,960
He does not seem upset at all.

686
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:02,640
In fact, he almost sounds relieved, even if
Timucin does not quite understand why.

687
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,769
"Then again, this is the reason we are here."

688
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:13,010
He gestures towards the tent to which his
daughter has walked back.

689
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:17,589
"Arbesa is waiting for you in your tent.

690
01:00:17,589 --> 01:00:21,000
Go to her and get to know her better.

691
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:28,270
We shall stay for a few days, and if you still
think she is the right one for you - and she

692
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:34,480
thinks you are the right one for her - then
you will return with us and spend the rest

693
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,329
of the year at our village."

694
01:00:38,329 --> 01:00:39,630
He smiles warmly.

695
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,710
"Now, get going.

696
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:48,470
If I know my daughter, she doesn't like being
kept waiting..."

697
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:54,579
CHAPTER SIX
The Prophecy

698
01:00:54,579 --> 01:01:02,280
He does not go straight back to his tent,
but stops by the fight to see how it ends.

699
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,539
It lasts for some time and gets ever more
bitter.

700
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:11,089
Well, at least Ilhan's father becomes more
bitter.

701
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:16,099
There is some blood too, even though the wounds
are only small, harmless cuts.

702
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:25,029
But Timucin is pleased when Tamer and Belmin
step in and declare the fight a tie.

703
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:30,900
Belmin's warrior looks happy and laughs as
he embraces his opponent.

704
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:39,079
Ilhan's father is clearly unhappy, however,
and Timucin sees that he would quite happily

705
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:45,819
take his sword and finish the fight if the
two khans were not there.

706
01:01:45,819 --> 01:01:52,020
The first fight is followed by others between
Belmin's men and village warriors, most are

707
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,640
just harmless tussles.

708
01:01:53,640 --> 01:02:01,529
The two khans, as well as most of the men,
return to the fire to continue the celebrations,

709
01:02:01,529 --> 01:02:06,359
and Timucin sits down with them without having
been asked.

710
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:13,369
To judge by the look his father gives him,
he does not like this, but he says nothing

711
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:18,499
and lets Timucin sit next to him for far longer
than usual.

712
01:02:18,499 --> 01:02:25,140
Not long before morning, Timucin finally gets
up and goes to his yurt.

713
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:32,749
He can almost feel the strange looks Belmin
gives him like a warm hand between his shoulder

714
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,420
blades.

715
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:39,900
It is dark and warm in his tent as he enters
the tent.

716
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:46,309
He has been hoping he will find Arbesa asleep,
and her regular, shallow breathing seems to

717
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:48,200
confirm this hope.

718
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:54,819
Timucin does not make a light, and tries to
undress without making any noise.

719
01:02:54,819 --> 01:03:03,769
The metal on his suit of armour makes this
impossible, however, it clinks and rattles.

720
01:03:03,769 --> 01:03:08,019
Arbesa's breathing does not change.

721
01:03:08,019 --> 01:03:14,729
But when he slips under the warm sheepskin
and carefully lies down back-to-back with

722
01:03:14,729 --> 01:03:19,380
her, she raises her head and speaks.

723
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:29,089
"So, all the fights are over and the great
warrior returns tired from battle."

724
01:03:29,089 --> 01:03:38,430
Her voice is quiet, derogatory and not at
all sleepy.

725
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:45,640
Timucin grounds his teeth in anger, not so
much at Arbesa's words, but at himself for

726
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:49,980
actually believing that, he would get off
so lightly.

727
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:58,670
His reason tells him to say nothing and pretend
to be asleep; but this is perhaps the first,

728
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:06,969
and definitely not the last time he realizes
how pointless it is to use a word like reason

729
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:10,039
when talking to a woman.

730
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:16,069
"It was just a bit of fun," he answers, without
raising his head.

731
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:18,319
"Yes, of course.

732
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:25,420
I think it's great fun to watch two men going
at each other with sharp iron blades and hitting

733
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:29,990
each other until they bleed," she replies.

734
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:37,319
This makes Timucin very angry, but he does
not really know with whom he is so angry.

735
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:44,239
He remains silent for a few moments, then
he sits up, shoves the sheepskin to the side

736
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:51,839
and feels around in the dark until he finds
a flint and the small oil lamp.

737
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:59,079
He is so angry that his hands are trembling
and it takes him five or six attempts to get

738
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:00,460
the wick.

739
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:06,789
Once he has finally succeeded, he is still
clumsy enough to burn his fingers on the tiny

740
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:07,789
flame.

741
01:05:07,789 --> 01:05:14,229
Arbesa's eyes glint with disdain as he turns
to her.

742
01:05:14,229 --> 01:05:19,920
She too has sat up and pushed the cover down
to her knees.

743
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:28,480
She is wearing nothing more than a very thin
dress, through which Timucin can see almost

744
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,480
everything.

745
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,420
It embarrasses him.

746
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,539
He looks down.

747
01:05:34,539 --> 01:05:41,979
"Why are you so shy, great warrior?" asks
Arbesa tauntingly.

748
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:47,829
Timucin says nothing in reply, but feels himself
going red again.

749
01:05:47,829 --> 01:05:53,059
"You are not embarrassed, are you?"

750
01:05:53,059 --> 01:05:56,150
continues the girl, pretending to blink in
surprise.

751
01:05:56,150 --> 01:06:02,040
"I mean, I don't know much about the customs
of your people, but isn't it usual for the

752
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:10,559
warrior to return to his woman after a successful
day's battling and lie with her?"

753
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,019
He does not answer.

754
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:21,640
After a brief pause, she adds: "Well, if they've
survived and have more to do than just bleed

755
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,089
in silence."

756
01:06:23,089 --> 01:06:28,489
"You do not have to sleep here," says Timucin,
annoyed.

757
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:33,319
"If you do not like my company, I can quite
happily ask my father to provide you with

758
01:06:33,319 --> 01:06:36,119
your own quarters."

759
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:39,690
Arbesa keeps smiling.

760
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:46,279
The yellow light of the oil lamp makes her
face appear even more beautiful than before,

761
01:06:46,279 --> 01:06:53,410
and despite his growing fury, he is incapable
of turning away from her.

762
01:06:53,410 --> 01:07:01,329
Moreover, there is a brief moment in which
she seems to realise that she may have gone

763
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:05,339
too far and is frightened.

764
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:13,059
It was, however, just a very brief moment,
then her beautiful face becomes just as scornful

765
01:07:13,059 --> 01:07:15,900
as ever, if not worse.

766
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:23,759
"Then again," she continues, as if he has
not said anything, "you look far better without

767
01:07:23,759 --> 01:07:25,240
those silly clothes.

768
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:31,229
It must be awfully uncomfortable to walk around
with more than your own weight on your body

769
01:07:31,229 --> 01:07:32,779
in iron."

770
01:07:32,779 --> 01:07:40,009
Timucin instinctively looks down at himself,
and Arbesa says quietly and, although he would

771
01:07:40,009 --> 01:07:48,280
not have thought it possible, more scornfully:
"Just don't you go getting any ideas."

772
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,890
"Ideas?

773
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:56,420
I don't know what to think at all," replies
Timucin sharply.

774
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:04,430
Well, he means it to sound sharp, but it sounds
more pathetic than anything, even to his own

775
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,430
ears.

776
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:12,660
He is so red that he does not really need
the lamp to light up his yurt.

777
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:19,650
Arbesa stops talking and, although Timucin
is not looking at her directly, he can feel

778
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:22,589
that her facial expression has changed.

779
01:08:22,589 --> 01:08:27,740
After what seems like an eternity, she speaks
again.

780
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,670
"I'm sorry.

781
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:32,440
I didn't mean to hurt you."

782
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,870
Timucin is surprised.

783
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:42,390
"You didn't hurt me," says Timucin, lying
without much conviction.

784
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:47,109
"And you need not apologise to anyone", he
adds.

785
01:08:47,109 --> 01:08:48,290
"Why?"

786
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,810
says Arbesa with a furrowed brow.

787
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:57,030
"Because you might be the wife of a khan one
of these days," he says, "and the wife of

788
01:08:57,030 --> 01:09:03,410
a khan never apologizes to anyone for anything."

789
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:07,740
The girl looks at him thoughtfully for a long
moment.

790
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:12,710
"And who taught you such rubbish?"

791
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:16,760
she asks in a soft but confused tone of voice.

792
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,000
"My father!"

793
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,870
answers Timucin loudly.

794
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:22,589
"And it is not rubbish!

795
01:09:22,589 --> 01:09:25,750
It is the truth!"

796
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:32,731
"Because your father is the khan, and because
the khan always speaks the truth, even if

797
01:09:32,731 --> 01:09:38,490
what he says is not true, you mean?" asks
Arbesa.

798
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:46,350
In that instant, her words make Timucin so
angry that he would like to grab her and shake

799
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:51,240
her until she takes them back and says she
is sorry.

800
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:59,670
Then he realizes what he has just been thinking
and laughs at himself against his own will.

801
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:04,450
"You're probably right," he says.

802
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:08,020
Arbesa is quiet again for a while.

803
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:14,590
She sits up again, pulls her knees to her
body and wraps her arms around them, and Timucin

804
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:20,980
finds it more and more difficult not to blatantly
stare at her.

805
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:27,170
He manages it somehow, but he is relatively
sure that the girl knows what is going on

806
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:29,170
inside him.

807
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:32,140
Not that he understands it himself.

808
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:38,340
"I didn't want to offend you," says Arbesa
finally.

809
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:46,080
"You haven't offended me," replies Timucin
and realizes only as he speaks these words

810
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,160
that they are the truth.

811
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,320
She has not offended him.

812
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:55,850
"But tell me, why are you so hostile?"

813
01:10:55,850 --> 01:11:01,440
"Am I so hostile?" asks Arbesa.

814
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:07,560
She leans her chin on her knees and looks
up at him, amused.

815
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,360
Then she shrugs her shoulders.

816
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:19,120
There is something about the mischievous glint
in her eyes that makes Timucin remember something

817
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:23,520
vaguely, but he does not know what.

818
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:32,790
Whatever it is, however, it is familiar and
fills him with a feeling of sudden warmth.

819
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:38,500
The feeling is so strong that he has to stop
himself from just hugging her.

820
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:43,040
"I'm just not used to all of this, you know."

821
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,500
"All of what?" asks Timucin.

822
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:53,020
"All these warriors and weapons and fun you
have fighting."

823
01:11:53,020 --> 01:12:01,830
"I understand," says Timucin, "I've heard
tell that your tribe is very peaceful."

824
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:07,100
He does not think that he has said anything
wrong, but suddenly Arbesa raises her head

825
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:11,600
and an angry crease appears between her thin
eyebrows.

826
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:16,330
"That's right, just go ahead and say what
you think!"

827
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:17,410
she snaps.

828
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:20,430
"You think we are tribe of cowards, don't
you?

829
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,140
That we don't like fighting."

830
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:30,330
Timucin is about to contradict this, and will
probably end up apologizing to her again,

831
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:33,290
but the girl does not let him speak a word.

832
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:37,610
She continues speaking, louder than before
and more angrily.

833
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:40,980
"You needn't have any qualms about speaking
freely.

834
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:46,820
I may still be a child, but I know very well
what other tribes think and say about us."

835
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:53,840
"I did not say that I thought your people
were cowards," says Timucin in his defence,

836
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,700
"but what kind of khan has a tribe without
warriors?"

837
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:03,070
"A very wise khan, perhaps?" asks Arbesa.

838
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:07,840
Her fury disappears as quickly as it came.

839
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,210
Yet something has changed.

840
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:17,860
The tender bond between them that appeared
a few moments back has been torn.

841
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:23,580
"But how do you expect to defend your land
and your property against enemies who may

842
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:27,940
want to rob you of it?" asks Timucin half-heartedly.

843
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:34,380
"No one has tried as yet," answers Arbesa
softly.

844
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:39,960
"Yes, perhaps because there is no honour in
winning against an enemy that cannot defend

845
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,640
itself," replies Timucin.

846
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:48,830
He regrets having said these words as soon
as he has said them.

847
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:55,440
Arbesa is not offended though; she simply
shrugs her shoulders and nods in the direction

848
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,840
of the entrance to the tent.

849
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,200
"How odd.

850
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:05,100
I thought I just watched my bodyguard win
against your man.

851
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:11,260
Simply because my people do not enjoy fighting,
we are not defenseless.

852
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13,640
You should try to listen to her."

853
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:20,930
"To her?" asks Timucin, not understanding
what Arbesa means.

854
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:27,450
She does not answer, however, and lies down,
pulls up the cover to her shoulders and turns

855
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:33,320
herself in it so that there is nothing left
for Timucin to protect himself from the cold

856
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,850
of the night.

857
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:41,910
He sits silently for some time looking at
the girl as she pretends to sleep before he

858
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,560
puts out the light.

859
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:55,910
He lies straight and waits for either sleep
or the cold, whichever comes first.

860
01:14:55,910 --> 01:15:01,620
The cold is the first of the two, and it stops
him sleeping.

861
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:08,780
After a while, however, Timucin finds himself
once again in the silvery moonlight of his

862
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:11,290
dream world.

863
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:20,810
Usually (not always, but almost always), he
has difficulty making out exact forms in his

864
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:30,370
dreams, but tonight he can see more than just
vague ghosts under a starry sky.

865
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:39,420
It is still a dark, nighttime world, but not
quite as impenetrable as usual.

866
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:47,950
Behind Sarantuya, he can see hills on a distant
horizon covered by woods, and a silver, winding

867
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:49,050
river.

868
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:54,010
No steppe, and no traces of people.

869
01:15:54,010 --> 01:16:00,890
Timucin can feel that this is a world untouched
by the hand of man.

870
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:10,280
He has an almost physical sense of great age
and of indescribable power, and this comes

871
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:17,290
not only from the huge dragon, but from the
fabric of this world itself, a world which

872
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:22,040
Sarantuya does not often let him see.

873
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:28,640
"Now, did I promise too much?" asks Sarantuya.

874
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:36,980
She is in a cheerful mood - well, as cheerful
as a dragon the size of ten oxen can appear,

875
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:37,980
at least.

876
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:46,140
There is a glint of mischief in her eyes,
and her long, scaly tail seems to thump on

877
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:50,210
the floor to the rhythm of some silent music.

878
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:54,420
"Wasn't that an exciting day?

879
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:55,650
Well?

880
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:58,110
Wasn't it?"

881
01:16:58,110 --> 01:17:01,790
"Yes," admits Timucin.

882
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:03,920
Then he pulls a face.

883
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:08,040
"Well, at least it was for some of us here."

884
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,310
"Oh, don't be like that about it!"

885
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:18,760
answers the dragon in a jovial tone, which
Timucin just does not understand.

886
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,480
"Come on!

887
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:26,480
Every man in the village would give his eye
teeth to share his yurt with the daughter

888
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,330
of such of a mighty khan!"

889
01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:34,290
"Yes, but she is a pain in the neck!" says
Timucin.

890
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:37,790
"Pain in the neck?

891
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:46,070
We have heard those words spoken before about
the son of certain khan in your village..."

892
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:49,210
The dragon lays her head sideways.

893
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:53,390
"So why is she such a pain?

894
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:56,030
Because she says the truth?"

895
01:17:56,030 --> 01:18:02,420
Timucin is offended, but does not say anything;
he knows there is no use.

896
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:08,870
When Sarantuya has decided to talk about a
certain topic, then she talks about it - and

897
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:11,330
that is that.

898
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:19,310
"Yes, but she laughed at me," he says after
some time, "and insulted my father."

899
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:26,460
"No, she didn't," says Sarantuya, shaking
her head so that he does not start to contradict

900
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,460
her.

901
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:32,730
Her smile disappears and her face looks worried,
quizzical.

902
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:40,050
"Nevertheless, I feel resentment in you, my
young friend.

903
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:43,620
What went wrong?"

904
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:49,790
At first, Timucin wants to deny everything,
but that would be pointless.

905
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:57,170
Even if Timucin tries to hide things, Sarantuya
can read his thoughts and he knows it.

906
01:18:57,170 --> 01:19:03,060
Nevertheless, she always insists on him saying
them out loud.

907
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,920
"Chuzir," he admits.

908
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:13,020
"Your friend or, I beg your pardon, your brother
in oath now.

909
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:17,710
That makes him more than just a friend, doesn't
it?"

910
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:20,650
"Some brother in oath!" says Timucin.

911
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:23,570
"He told everyone about it!"

912
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:30,090
"About what?" asks the dragon, pretending
not to know.

913
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:34,310
"About the thing with the dog," he answers
angrily.

914
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:38,010
"Now everyone in the village knows that I
am afraid of dogs.

915
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:41,030
Not just my father, but all of them."

916
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:44,290
"And what is so bad about that?

917
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:53,250
I know that you know this already, but I shall
say it again: even the heart of the bravest

918
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:57,610
warrior is not free of fear.

919
01:19:57,610 --> 01:20:06,180
Only the most stupid people have no fear of
anything, and these people do not live very

920
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,190
long.

921
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:10,960
But that is beside the point.

922
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,690
Even we dragons know fear."

923
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:15,920
"Fear of what?"

924
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:22,870
"You would not understand it," answers Sarantuya
mysteriously.

925
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:27,130
"And this is not what we are talking about.

926
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:35,540
Now, tell me, what is so bad about everyone
knowing you are afraid of something?"

927
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:43,050
"Not just something," answers Timucin, "but
dogs!

928
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:45,100
Mangy little mutts!

929
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,950
Everyone will laugh at me."

930
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:51,870
Well, to be precise, they are already laughing,
he thinks.

931
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:58,120
"No one will laugh at you when you are khan,"
says Sarantuya.

932
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:02,070
"And what takes more courage?

933
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:09,350
To face the scorn of your tribesmen because
of who you are, or to fight with - what did

934
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:13,090
you call it - a mangy little mutt?

935
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:17,770
You could have beaten it to death if you had
wanted.

936
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:20,470
You are strong."

937
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:26,700
"No, I am a coward," says Timucin bitterly.

938
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:32,060
"No, you are not!" says Sarantuya, almost
angrily.

939
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:39,020
"You were afraid of this dog, but you were
even more afraid of people finding this out

940
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:41,210
and laughing at you.

941
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:50,280
A real coward kills what he fears, so that
no one finds out about his fear."

942
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:58,290
Timucin thinks about the mighty teeth and
the wild look in the dog's eyes.

943
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:04,420
He doubts whether the animal really was all
that harmless, but does not say anything for

944
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,620
the moment.

945
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:11,430
"I still don't understand why he did it, though!"
he continues.

946
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:17,860
"He is supposed to be my best friend, and
he betrayed me!

947
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:19,280
Why?"

948
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:28,190
"Because, unlike you, in the depths of his
heart he really is a coward!"

949
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:31,610
answers Sarantuya quietly.

950
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:35,730
"And he is furious."

951
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:37,600
"Furious?

952
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,090
At me?

953
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:40,330
But why me?

954
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:43,450
I have never done anything to him!"

955
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:46,970
"He missed the dog.

956
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:54,290
For the first time ever he missed a target,
and he blames you.

957
01:22:54,290 --> 01:23:00,930
And he is not entirely wrong, if you think
about it a moment."

958
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:02,240
"Why?

959
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:06,310
Because my arrow was bent?" says Timucin.

960
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:13,280
"Well, that is certainly what he thinks,"
says Sarantuya, winking conspiratorially,

961
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:19,300
"but you and I both know why he really missed."

962
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:23,270
Timucin keeps quiet.

963
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:27,790
What Sarantuya says does not make anything
better.

964
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:34,100
In any case, it is unimportant why he is to
blame for Chuzir's failure.

965
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:43,830
"He is already regretting having told everyone,"
says Sarantuya, "so don't be angry with him.

966
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:48,470
You are friends after all, right?"

967
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:55,730
"Well, that's what I thought until now, yes,"
says Timucin, upset.

968
01:23:55,730 --> 01:24:01,030
"Friendship also means forgiving," says Sarantuya.

969
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:06,500
"In fact, that is what it means above all."

970
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:14,840
Timucin is about to make a nasty comment when
he notices movement in the corner of his eye

971
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,590
and turns round, frightened.

972
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:20,710
Something rushes away.

973
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:28,790
It is big, scaly and snake-like, and disappears
so quickly that he cannot make it out.

974
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:31,680
Was it perhaps a...?

975
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:39,450
Surprised, he turns back to Sarantuya, who
answers his question before he has asked it.

976
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:42,820
"Don't ask, my little friend.

977
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:46,910
I can't answer, and he won't talk to you either.

978
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:52,140
We only talk to the people we belong to."

979
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:57,100
It takes a moment for Timucin to understand
what she means.

980
01:24:57,100 --> 01:25:07,700
"So... you mean that somebody else here is
speaking to a dragon right now?" he murmurs.

981
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:13,310
A moment ago, he would never have believed
that dragons could grin.

982
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:19,440
But Sarantuya can, and she grins almost shamelessly.

983
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,290
"Yes.

984
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:23,680
For some time, too!"

985
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:34,940
It takes Timucin even longer to understand,
then he turns around half-terrified to Arbesa.

986
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:42,900
She is not there, of course, because this
is just a dream.

987
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:45,080
Sarantuya giggles.

988
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:49,450
"Arbesa?" he murmurs skeptically.

989
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:55,230
"You mean... she too has a dragon?"

990
01:25:55,230 --> 01:26:04,890
"Well, actually it's us dragons who have you
and not you us," says Sarantuya, a little

991
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:08,220
offended, "but yes, she does."

992
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:11,700
"Oh," says Timucin.

993
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,860
"Oh.

994
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:21,020
Yes 'oh' indeed" says Sarantuya, making fun
of his tone of voice.

995
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:25,220
"So you thought you were the only one?"

996
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:30,760
"If I'm honest, yes I did."

997
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:39,580
In fact, if he is completely honest, he is
not even sure whether Sarantuya actually exists

998
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:40,600
at all.

999
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:48,710
"Well, in that case, I'm going to have to
disappoint you," says Sarantuya, teasing him,

1000
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:53,240
"you're not as special as all that, my little
Khan!"

1001
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:58,190
"But why did Arbesa not say anything about
it?"

1002
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:00,120
mumbles Timucin.

1003
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:03,420
"Why should she?

1004
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:06,770
She doesn't know you at all."

1005
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:14,560
Timucin thinks back: in fact, she did say
something about it.

1006
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:19,300
"Anyway, it's nothing special to her.

1007
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:23,460
Almost everyone in her tribe has a dragon-friend."

1008
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:30,140
"The whole tribe?" says Timucin, astonished.

1009
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:38,680
"Well, almost all of them," answers Sarantuya,
"because they are a very peaceful people,

1010
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:43,120
and dragons love peaceful people."

1011
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,960
"What?

1012
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:50,810
Dragons, of all creatures!" he says.

1013
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:55,970
He regrets this immediately, but of course,
Sarantuya would have heard these words even

1014
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:59,180
if he had just thought them.

1015
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:05,690
She looks offended, upset and ever so slightly
angry.

1016
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:14,360
"You think that, just because we are big and
strong, we are dangerous?"

1017
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,860
she asks.

1018
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:21,480
Timucin discovers that it is possible to blush
in a dream too.

1019
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,490
He keeps silent.

1020
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:32,220
"We are big and very strong," continues Sarantuya,
sounding suddenly very serious and still slightly

1021
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:41,780
angry, "so no one can be of any danger to
us, but why should this make us into beasts?

1022
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:45,190
We are not like you people!"

1023
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:52,020
Timucin wants to say something, but Sarantuya
motions him to keep quiet with an astonishingly

1024
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:54,910
human movement of her right paw.

1025
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:58,760
"I know what people say about us.

1026
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:08,200
You all think we are monsters, horrible monsters
who eat people and animals and burn land with

1027
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,190
our breath of fire."

1028
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:14,080
She winks at him before continuing.

1029
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:18,780
"That's about the size of it, right?"

1030
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,900
"Hm," says Timucin.

1031
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:24,910
"But that is not the way it is.

1032
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:32,940
We are just as big and strong as you think,
even stronger - just one of us could wipe

1033
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:37,270
your tribe off the face of the earth.

1034
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:40,090
But why would we do that?

1035
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:49,880
No dragon has ever killed a person, and we
never shall, as long as you are in existence."

1036
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:56,060
"I'm sorry," murmurs Timucin, "I didn't mean
to hurt you."

1037
01:29:56,060 --> 01:30:03,260
"I know," says Sarantuya in her usual, softer
tones.

1038
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:05,590
Suddenly, she starts giggling.

1039
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:15,080
"Did I just mishear something, or did you
just say sorry to me, son of the khan?"

1040
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:21,470
Timucin is silent and Sarantuya is serious
again.

1041
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:28,930
"Well, you would have asked that question
at some point, and I've just answered it.

1042
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:34,010
Perhaps this was the right moment, now that
you have met your wife."

1043
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:37,170
"We are not married yet!"

1044
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:46,440
objects Timucin, but Sarantuya shakes her
head, her scales jingling lightly as she does.

1045
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:49,890
"She will be your wife, young Khan.

1046
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:59,070
You will live a long and happy life together,
even though you will betray her one day."

1047
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:00,590
"Me?

1048
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:03,830
Never!" says Timucin, outraged.

1049
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:13,740
"Yes, yes, you will," says Sarantuya softly,
"but don't worry - she will forgive you."

1050
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:22,110
"You can see into the future?" says Timucin,
eyes wide open.

1051
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:30,190
"Not everything," says Sarantuya, "We dragons
do not see into the future, not in the way

1052
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:31,960
you think."

1053
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:37,690
"Well, you did predict that I was going to
meet somebody who would be of great importance

1054
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:38,690
to me."

1055
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:44,920
"That wasn't the future, my little friend
that was just one day.

1056
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:49,260
But we do see a lot, that is true.

1057
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:58,020
Some of the paths into the future are clear
and wide, some thin and blurred, or even forked.

1058
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:06,040
I can tell you that Arbesa will become your
wife and that you will live long and happily

1059
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:07,040
together.

1060
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:11,450
What you do in that time is up to you.

1061
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:13,640
I can't see that."

1062
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:19,920
"And even if you could see it, you wouldn't
tell me," says Timucin.

1063
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:28,460
"That's true," answers Sarantuya cheerfully,
"but you will find the right way in any case.

1064
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:31,590
I'm almost sure!"

1065
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:33,710
"Almost?"

1066
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:42,240
"Almost," insists Sarantuya, "because even
we dragons don't know everything.

1067
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:47,870
We have neither the right nor the power to
get involved in your lives.

1068
01:32:47,870 --> 01:32:54,120
But you have a good heart and I believe in
you.

1069
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:57,860
Otherwise I wouldn't have chosen you1."

1070
01:32:57,860 --> 01:32:59,000
"Chosen?"

1071
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,280
repeats Timucin.

1072
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:09,780
"We dragons choose the people to whom we wish
to offer our friendship, and we choose very

1073
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:12,310
carefully.

1074
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:19,631
Only those who are pure of heart and who do
not go the way of the sword will ever know

1075
01:33:19,631 --> 01:33:20,890
us."

1076
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:27,840
Sarantuya hesitates for a moment, as if she
is not sure if she should continue talking

1077
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,610
or not, but she does.

1078
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:36,740
"You have never spoken of me to your father,
am I right?"

1079
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:43,150
Timucin answers with a shake of his head,
and Sarantuya continues.

1080
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:47,310
"And perhaps you shouldn't.

1081
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:53,830
Did you know that he too once had a dragon
companion?"

1082
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:57,920
Timucin's eyes open wide.

1083
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,140
"What?

1084
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:00,320
My father?

1085
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,680
The khan?"

1086
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:10,220
"Before he was khan," answers Sarantuya, "at
about your age."

1087
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:11,220
She laughs good-temperedly.

1088
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:22,640
"I shouldn't tell you of course... but...
but he too was afraid."

1089
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:27,320
"Of dogs?"

1090
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:30,990
"No, of horses!"

1091
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:33,530
chortled Sarantuya.

1092
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:36,070
"Of horses?"

1093
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:38,610
gasps Timucin.

1094
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:43,750
"My father the khan was afraid of horses?!"

1095
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:54,260
"He was not khan back then," answers Sarantuya,
"and he faced and conquered his fear."

1096
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:59,670
Timucin needs a while to get used to this
idea.

1097
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:01,510
"And?

1098
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:04,070
What happened then?" he asks.

1099
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:13,060
"He went the wrong way," answers Sarantuya
in a way that makes it clear to Timucin that

1100
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:18,200
it is pointless to ask any further questions.

1101
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,250
She changes the subject.

1102
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:24,990
"Back then, many of us had friends in your
tribe.

1103
01:35:24,990 --> 01:35:30,880
There was even a time when all of you had
dragons.

1104
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:36,780
Why else do you think that so many of your
tribe can remember us, without ever having

1105
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:38,550
seen us?"

1106
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:42,410
"What happened?" asks Timucin.

1107
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:51,970
"The same thing as almost always," answers
Sarantuya sadly, "too many of you chose the

1108
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:54,350
wrong path."

1109
01:35:54,350 --> 01:36:04,310
Timucin can feel the dragon's sorrow and he
realizes that he has hit upon a subject that

1110
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:07,310
she does not want to talk about.

1111
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:13,930
Nevertheless, he asks another question, quietly.

1112
01:36:13,930 --> 01:36:20,740
"And which path is the wrong path, exactly?"

1113
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:30,660
"Later," answers Sarantuya, clearing her throat
loudly, "perhaps I've already told you enough

1114
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:32,810
for one day.

1115
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:36,060
Just be patient, my little Khan.

1116
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:42,960
We will have plenty of opportunities to talk
again, perhaps your whole life long.

1117
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,260
But that is your decision."

1118
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:55,050
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Bodyguard

1119
01:36:55,050 --> 01:36:59,720
Arbesa has already gone when Timucin wakes
up.

1120
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:07,190
It is at least an hour after sunrise, he has
a horrible taste in his mouth and a throbbing

1121
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:08,950
headache.

1122
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:16,220
It is as if he hasn't just sat with the men,
but also drunk the spirits made of fermented

1123
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:20,440
sheep's milk that they sometimes take to excess.

1124
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:28,720
Moreover, he still has the strange dream in
his head - something to do with the dragon

1125
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:34,910
and Arbesa, although he cannot remember any
precise details.

1126
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:40,940
He's probably breathed in too much smoke from
the fire, which would explain both the headache

1127
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:44,130
and odd dreams, he thinks.

1128
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:47,750
Where is Arbesa, though?

1129
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:55,050
Timucin looks at the empty bed next to him
and is almost annoyed, until he remembers

1130
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:59,130
that he is behaving like an old married man.

1131
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:07,130
Sarantuya has said that they will get married,
but only at some point, and that is assuming

1132
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:14,140
that Timucin understood correctly, and assuming
that she has actually spoken to him and that

1133
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:21,150
this is not all just some strange fantasy
that he has experienced.

1134
01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:24,010
That was no fantasy, though.

1135
01:38:24,010 --> 01:38:28,950
His father used to be afraid of horses?

1136
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:32,130
How pathetic is that?!

1137
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:41,740
Timucin curls his lip in scorn at the very
thought of it, and stands up.

1138
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:48,570
The noises of village life penetrate into
the tent, at once muffled and yet somehow

1139
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:51,060
urgent, too.

1140
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:58,710
He just manages to stop himself shaking his
head to dispel his sleepiness - it would probably

1141
01:38:58,710 --> 01:39:01,250
explode.

1142
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:08,900
He feels this bad without even having tasted
a drop of the fermented sheep's milk.

1143
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:15,140
This is not the first time he asks himself
what the warriors see in drinking themselves

1144
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:18,670
into unconsciousness night after night.

1145
01:39:18,670 --> 01:39:24,910
Anyway: his father used to be afraid of horses?

1146
01:39:24,910 --> 01:39:26,570
Pathetic!

1147
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:32,340
Timucin steps out of the tent, crouching as
he goes.

1148
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:40,410
He feels like a grown warrior with a hangover
as the bright morning sun stabs at his eyes,

1149
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:47,860
and he does not just blink, but has to grind
his teeth to avoid groaning out loud.

1150
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:53,840
Normally, his father and the warriors behave
like this in the morning when the night has

1151
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:57,950
been too short and too festive.

1152
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:03,320
He understands the attraction of drink less
than ever this morning.

1153
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:09,580
What he does understand, though, is why the
men are often so anxious to get down to the

1154
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:10,800
river.

1155
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:19,900
He feels dirty, his whole body is sticky,
and his clothes and hair smell so badly of

1156
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:23,770
smoke that he almost feels ill.

1157
01:40:23,770 --> 01:40:30,340
He wants nothing more than to get to the river,
but before he sets off, he remembers that

1158
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:36,450
his father has asked him to make sure he is
always dressed properly as long as there are

1159
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:39,000
guests in the village.

1160
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:47,020
So he gathers up all his armour and weapons
into a bundle that he slings over his shoulder.

1161
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:53,060
As he makes his way to the hill, he groans
under the weight of it.

1162
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:58,600
Arbesa was right: it weighs more than he does.

1163
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:04,310
Suddenly he is no longer angry at her for
having gone; at least she does not have to

1164
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:08,650
see him in this miserable state.

1165
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:15,700
He drags his feet up the hill without replying
to any of the tribespeople who greet him.

1166
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:22,920
Then he crosses the patch of woods where he
and Chuzir gave their oath, yawning and even

1167
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:26,770
stopping a couple of times to regain his strength.

1168
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:34,690
As he passes the bush into which the dog disappeared,
an un-pleasant memory tries to break into

1169
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:42,850
his mind, but he ignores it and forces himself
to think of nothing - which is not hard in

1170
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:45,810
his current state.

1171
01:41:45,810 --> 01:41:51,920
After what seems like an eternity, he can
see the river shimmering through the undergrowth

1172
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,670
in front of him.

1173
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:59,410
He sets off faster towards the water and then
throws his bundle of clothing and armour to

1174
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:04,750
the ground so that it rattles and jingles
for a few moments.

1175
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:10,910
He reaches for his underwear and is about
to pull it off over his head, when he sees

1176
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:17,190
something out of the corner of his eye and
stops.

1177
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:23,300
Something or someone is splashing in the water.

1178
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:31,860
Timucin looks closely and notices that he
is blushing again; someone is swimming in

1179
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:34,920
the shallow waters of the Omon.

1180
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:39,220
That someone is Arbesa.

1181
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:43,050
She is wearing less than the night before.

1182
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:45,370
Well, nothing.

1183
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:53,340
And the water is so clear that it hides nothing.

1184
01:42:53,340 --> 01:43:00,900
If she finds it as embarrassing as Timucin,
she hides it masterfully as she kicks around

1185
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:05,930
in the water lying on her back and looking
up at him with her glinting eyes.

1186
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:12,370
She does not even have the decency to pretend
to be embarrassed, and is having a lot of

1187
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:15,160
fun at Timucin's expense.

1188
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:21,730
"My, oh my, our great warrior is already awake!"

1189
01:43:21,730 --> 01:43:27,990
she says teasingly, picking up last night's
conversation as if there has been no interruption.

1190
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:28,990
"Astonishing!

1191
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:34,130
Don't you need more time to recover from the
great battle?"

1192
01:43:34,130 --> 01:43:37,860
"Good morning to you, too!"

1193
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:40,450
growls Timucin.

1194
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:45,530
Last night, when Sarantuya told him about
his future with Arbesa, he still liked the

1195
01:43:45,530 --> 01:43:51,580
idea despite their misunderstanding, but perhaps
one should not believe everything dragons

1196
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:57,570
say, especially female dragons.

1197
01:43:57,570 --> 01:44:03,240
He is close to taking off his clothes and
jumping into the water, but then he reconsiders

1198
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:10,010
and wades into the icy water, his teeth chattering
as he goes.

1199
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:17,520
Arbesa moves a little aside but doesn't let
him out of her vision for an instant.

1200
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:24,050
She looks even more scornfully in his direction,
but what else can he expect?

1201
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:30,240
"Does your tribe always wash with its clothes
on?"

1202
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,640
she asks.

1203
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:39,800
Timucin looks at her angrily, dives under
and stays below the waterline until his lungs

1204
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:46,350
are crying out for air and his heart is about
to burst.

1205
01:44:46,350 --> 01:44:53,070
He resurfaces, spluttering and gasping for
air, runs his hands though his long, wet hair

1206
01:44:53,070 --> 01:44:54,540
and then answers.

1207
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:59,870
"Only if the water is dirty or full of vermin."

1208
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:09,890
Arbesa looks at him confused, shrugs her shoulders
and then paddles away on her back using only

1209
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:12,140
her hands and feet.

1210
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:20,250
Then, however, she turns back in order to
circle around him, getting closer and closer,

1211
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:24,230
like a predator around its prey.

1212
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:31,090
He dives again, swims underwater back to the
bank and wades back out of the water, soaking

1213
01:45:31,090 --> 01:45:32,090
wet.

1214
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:39,870
If Arbesa were not there, he would have taken
his underwear off now and wrung it out, but

1215
01:45:39,870 --> 01:45:42,980
she keeps looking at him.

1216
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:49,280
So he runs his hands over his undergarments
and bends down to pick up his bundle.

1217
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:54,930
He threw it carelessly, so he spends quite
some time untangling it before he can put

1218
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:56,270
his clothes on.

1219
01:45:56,270 --> 01:46:02,690
His wet underwear makes every movement more
difficult, however, and sticks to his body

1220
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:04,400
as he goes.

1221
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:11,060
He is annoyed when he thinks about how long
it will take to dry under all this leather,

1222
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:16,440
and his skin already feels cold enough as
it is.

1223
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:25,260
Arbesa must be thinking the same; even without
turning to her, he can feel her scornful gaze.

1224
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:32,720
Sarantuya might have predicted he would betray
her, but perhaps the dragon was wrong: he

1225
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:38,220
feels more like drowning her than anything
else.

1226
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:45,530
Without saying a word, he finishes dressing
himself, not because he really wants to or

1227
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:51,540
because his father has asked him to, but more
than any-thing because of what Arbesa said

1228
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:53,850
to him last night.

1229
01:46:53,850 --> 01:47:01,070
He even puts on his belt and weapons as well
as his shield and helmet.

1230
01:47:01,070 --> 01:47:07,090
Only then, does he turn to the water and see
that Arbesa really has been watching him the

1231
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:08,090
whole time.

1232
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:14,540
Her eyes are still as wide and defiant as
ever.

1233
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:20,750
Suddenly, he remembers what they remind of
him: of Sarantuya.

1234
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:23,620
Arbesa has Sarantuya's eyes!

1235
01:47:23,620 --> 01:47:32,090
It is almost as if he does not want to, but
he asks her a question.

1236
01:47:32,090 --> 01:47:36,120
"What is she called?"

1237
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:38,420
"He."

1238
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:45,861
She keeps smiling, and something comes into
her eyes that touches and warms him for a

1239
01:47:45,861 --> 01:47:47,160
brief instant.

1240
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:53,990
"I'm a girl, and our dragons are always male.

1241
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:56,390
Just like yours are always female."

1242
01:47:56,390 --> 01:48:05,570
"Now I understand what the warriors mean when
they talk about their wives," he replies,

1243
01:48:05,570 --> 01:48:06,570
grinning.

1244
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:13,690
Arbesa smiles back, but her eyes keep their
strange new expression.

1245
01:48:13,690 --> 01:48:16,130
"Tselmeg.

1246
01:48:16,130 --> 01:48:19,490
His name is Tselmeg."

1247
01:48:19,490 --> 01:48:25,541
She paddles around in the water a little more
as if she is waiting for an answer, and when

1248
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:29,550
she does not get one, she turns her back to
him.

1249
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:38,360
Timucin clears his throat awkwardly, starts
to turn around and stops still.

1250
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:47,050
His good mood disappears again instantly and
his face darkens.

1251
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:55,410
He is no longer alone; just a little behind
him, four or five boys climb out of the bush

1252
01:48:55,410 --> 01:49:00,230
into which the dog had disappeared the day
before yesterday.

1253
01:49:00,230 --> 01:49:08,090
One of them is Chuzir, another is Ilhan, and
the other three are Ilhan's most trusted friends

1254
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:12,850
- and the worst bullies in the tribe.

1255
01:49:12,850 --> 01:49:24,260
At first, they just stand there staring at
him; all except Chuzir are smiling threateningly

1256
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:27,520
and Timucin's heart starts to beat faster.

1257
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:37,820
"Uh oh," sneers Arbesa, "now our big, strong
warrior has a bit of a problem.

1258
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:45,200
But it won't be too bad - I mean, he is armed,
at least."

1259
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:51,210
Although she is only saying this to rib him,
and he knows it, Timucin does not feel like

1260
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:53,320
laughing right now.

1261
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:56,690
The sight of the five boys scares him.

1262
01:49:56,690 --> 01:50:05,160
They too are armed, Chuzir with his bow and
arrow, the four others with clubs that they

1263
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:07,950
have clearly just cut from the trees.

1264
01:50:07,950 --> 01:50:12,380
What use is his sword now?

1265
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:17,180
He is not going to run at them with a bare
blade.

1266
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:20,480
If fighting is at all necessary.

1267
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:28,140
Timucin thinks for a moment, and although
his heart is still beating fast, he realizes

1268
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:32,520
that he does not yet know what they want.

1269
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:37,850
Perhaps they are just here by chance, and
he remembers what his father has often told

1270
01:50:37,850 --> 01:50:42,830
him: if you show fear, your enemy will see
it too.

1271
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:47,470
Don't show fear, and they will avoid a fight.

1272
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:53,850
"And who is saying anything about fighting
anyway?"

1273
01:50:53,850 --> 01:50:58,900
whispers someone to him from behind his forehead.

1274
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:07,020
As he steps towards the boys, he realizes
it is Sarantuya's voice and stops again.

1275
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:12,870
The dragon is there, invisible to all except
him.

1276
01:51:12,870 --> 01:51:23,920
It is strange that she is there: this is the
first time he has heard her voice whilst awake.

1277
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:27,420
Something very important must have happened.

1278
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:32,990
Without even being aware of it, he looks left
and right.

1279
01:51:32,990 --> 01:51:39,260
The dragon is nowhere to be seen, of course,
but Ilhan and his friends notice the move

1280
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:45,890
and a wide, sneering grin spreads across Ilhan's
face.

1281
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:54,130
"Don't you worry, oh mighty Khan," he scoffs,
"there aren't any dogs around."

1282
01:51:54,130 --> 01:52:03,220
Timucin sucks air through his teeth and then
walks on, holding his shoulders as straight

1283
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:04,630
as he can.

1284
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:12,160
His right hand is on the hilt of his sword,
as if it had just landed there, but this does

1285
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:18,170
not have the effect he expects and Ilhan's
grin just gets broader.

1286
01:52:18,170 --> 01:52:21,060
"Well, look at that!

1287
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:30,660
Our future khan has put on his sword and shield
in order to defend the honour of his bride.

1288
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:36,680
Then again," he continues, looking lewdly
in the direction of the river, "it does not

1289
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:41,050
seem like there is much to defend in this
case."

1290
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:47,030
For an instant, Timucin sees red.

1291
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:55,390
For a short moment, he must stop himself actually
pulling his sword and cutting Ilhan's stupid

1292
01:52:55,390 --> 01:52:58,030
smile out of his face.

1293
01:52:58,030 --> 01:53:03,780
Then, however, he calls himself down.

1294
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:12,910
He and Arbesa have done nothing dishonorable,
and nakedness is not a taboo in the tribe.

1295
01:53:12,910 --> 01:53:20,070
Men, women and children often wash in the
river together, and they never wear clothes

1296
01:53:20,070 --> 01:53:22,130
like he just has.

1297
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:27,580
Ilhan is just trying to get him angry.

1298
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:34,810
"What do you want?" he asks in a strong voice.

1299
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:41,180
He is careful not to look at Chuzir as he
says this, but his brother in oath licks his

1300
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:46,610
lips nervously and looks away quickly nonetheless.

1301
01:53:46,610 --> 01:53:53,990
Timucin thinks back to what Sarantuya told
him last night and sees that it was the truth.

1302
01:53:53,990 --> 01:54:02,270
Chuzir is already regretting his mistake,
but why is he here with the others, then?

1303
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:05,920
Timucin is confused.

1304
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:14,030
Sarantuya answers him silently: Because he
cannot go back.

1305
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:20,930
One mistake all too often leads directly to
another if the person making it does not have

1306
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:23,860
the courage to face it.

1307
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:33,420
"Oh, we just wanted to make sure that our
future khan and his bride are not in any danger,"

1308
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:34,460
answers Ilhan.

1309
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:36,400
"Woof woof!"

1310
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:39,090
adds one of the other boys.

1311
01:54:39,090 --> 01:54:44,090
Timucin ignores this and replies coldly.

1312
01:54:44,090 --> 01:54:48,050
"Well, everything is fine, thanks.

1313
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:55,300
It is good to see, however, that you already
know the debt you owe your future ruler."

1314
01:54:55,300 --> 01:55:05,990
Chuzir takes a small, nervous step backwards;
Ilhan's hand grasps his club tighter.

1315
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:08,620
His eyes flash with fury.

1316
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:17,150
"Don't be too sure about that, Timucin," he
growls, "you are not yet khan."

1317
01:55:17,150 --> 01:55:23,060
"And if I were, that shouldn't stop you,"
answers Timucin defiantly.

1318
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:28,490
"Just imagine that I am some boy, any boy,
from the village."

1319
01:55:28,490 --> 01:55:37,780
"Hm, I'm having trouble doing that," answers
Ilhan icily, "because all the other boys in

1320
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:44,180
the village have the heart of a true warrior."

1321
01:55:44,180 --> 01:55:51,670
He is only trying to provoke you, whispers
Sarantuya, and there is no shame in avoiding

1322
01:55:51,670 --> 01:55:56,090
a fight that you cannot win.

1323
01:55:56,090 --> 01:56:01,910
His father has already told him this more
than once, and it always sounded obvious and

1324
01:56:01,910 --> 01:56:02,910
convincing.

1325
01:56:02,910 --> 01:56:08,970
Oddly enough, however, it does not sound so
obvious or convincing now.

1326
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:18,620
In fact, Timucin feels pure rage welling up
inside him, but fear at the same time.

1327
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:25,410
There are four of them - not counting Chuzir
- and Ilhan on his own is stronger than him.

1328
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:28,520
So he says nothing.

1329
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:36,110
Suddenly, the bigger boy smiles a broad and
unmistakably dirty smile.

1330
01:56:36,110 --> 01:56:46,110
"We do beg your pardon, oh most noble Khan,"
he says in a smutty tone, "if you want to

1331
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:50,880
be alone with your bride, we'll happily turn
round.

1332
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:55,100
Unless you need help..."

1333
01:56:55,100 --> 01:57:01,520
The other boys, except Chuzir, greet this
comment with dirty laughter.

1334
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:06,270
"Take that back!" hisses Timucin.

1335
01:57:06,270 --> 01:57:11,970
"What if I don't?" asks Ilhan.

1336
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:15,900
Timucin looks down at the club in Ilhan's
hand.

1337
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:22,760
Ilhan shrugs his shoulders and sends it flying
into the bushes.

1338
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:27,800
"Just so you can't say we were unfair about
it.

1339
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:33,940
You are welcome to use your sword, however,
great Khan - at least then we would be about

1340
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:34,990
even."

1341
01:57:34,990 --> 01:57:42,530
"I don't want to fight you," says Timucin,
who is almost surprised as he hears his own

1342
01:57:42,530 --> 01:57:43,530
words.

1343
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:47,990
"We have one blood; why should we strike one
another?"

1344
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:53,230
Ilhan pulls a mock-disappointed face.

1345
01:57:53,230 --> 01:57:56,440
"Hmm, why?

1346
01:57:56,440 --> 01:58:03,370
Perhaps because I do not want to serve a khan
who is a coward?" he suggests.

1347
01:58:03,370 --> 01:58:10,490
Timucin does not reply to this, but suddenly
feels a tension in his thoughts that does

1348
01:58:10,490 --> 01:58:13,300
not come from him.

1349
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:22,040
Sarantuya is looking at him and clearly expects
a certain reaction, but he does not know which.

1350
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:26,300
Besides, he is terribly afraid.

1351
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:31,640
He has understood that there is no way he
can avoid this fight.

1352
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:37,990
Ilhan and the others have come to fight him
here and now, and have chosen this moment

1353
01:58:37,990 --> 01:58:43,800
so that Arbesa will see - for whatever reason.

1354
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:50,210
Instead of answering, he takes off his shield,
slowly lays it down on the floor and then

1355
01:58:50,210 --> 01:58:53,450
removes his sword and belt.

1356
01:58:53,450 --> 01:59:02,600
Ilhan stops his pretend surprise, shrugs his
shoulders, and then nods at his friends.

1357
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:05,610
"Well, what do you know?

1358
01:59:05,610 --> 01:59:08,240
Our little khan shows courage!

1359
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:12,050
Now, show us what you've got!"

1360
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:17,330
This is the cue for one of the boys to go
into the bushes and come back with a string

1361
01:59:17,330 --> 01:59:21,170
on which a dog has been leashed.

1362
01:59:21,170 --> 01:59:28,270
On closer inspection, however, it appears
to be something that thinks it is a dog, because

1363
01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:36,830
it smaller than most cats, has a mangy coat,
and is slobbering so badly that it has left

1364
01:59:36,830 --> 01:59:39,820
a wet trail behind it.

1365
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:43,030
One of its ears has been torn off.

1366
01:59:43,030 --> 01:59:47,010
It growls quietly when it sees Timucin.

1367
01:59:47,010 --> 01:59:56,240
"Now don't be afraid, oh great Khan," smirks
Ilhan, his three stooges laughing spitefully,

1368
01:59:56,240 --> 02:00:07,360
"and if this terrifying beast gets too dangerous,
just say the word and we'll do what we can."

1369
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:16,040
On this, the boy lets the dog loose and it
runs straight at Timucin, barking furiously

1370
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:17,040
as it goes.

1371
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:24,700
It is a pathetic creature, and not even Timucin
can be afraid of it.

1372
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:32,720
Nevertheless, he takes a step back, perhaps
out of reflex, and Ilhan laughs loudly.

1373
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:42,310
Meanwhile, invisible and silent, Sarantuya
stretches her wings and, just as it about

1374
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:50,800
to reach Timucin, the dog jumps back in fear,
runs around looking scared and then runs back

1375
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:56,150
with its tail between its legs, squeaking
as it goes.

1376
02:00:56,150 --> 02:01:03,760
Ilhan looks surprised, truly, but then his
face darkens.

1377
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:11,720
"Fine," he growls, "but let's see if you can
scare off something that isn't ten times smaller

1378
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:13,440
than you!"

1379
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:17,390
He lunges at Timucin with his fists curled.

1380
02:01:17,390 --> 02:01:23,310
It is more a reflex than anything else that
helps Timucin to fend off his first punch,

1381
02:01:23,310 --> 02:01:30,020
but the sheer force of Ilhan's wild attack
throws Timucin to the ground and Ilhan rams

1382
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:36,830
his knee so hard against his chest that it
is probably only his armour that saves his

1383
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:39,440
ribs from being broken like little twigs.

1384
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:43,396
The air whistles out of his lungs and, for
a second, his vision is clouded by red pain.

1385
02:01:43,396 --> 02:01:49,550
His heart explodes in fear and he would scream
if he had enough air.

1386
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:57,300
Ilhan bellows triumphantly, punches him a
few times in the face and knocks his arms

1387
02:01:57,300 --> 02:02:01,700
back without any effort at all, as he tries
to hit back.

1388
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:08,570
The next punch splits his bottom lip; then
his nose starts to bleed; the punch after

1389
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:13,260
that almost sends him into unconsciousness.

1390
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:15,710
Sarantuya!

1391
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:17,780
Help me!

1392
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:23,230
In his mind, he is screaming for help.

1393
02:02:23,230 --> 02:02:25,600
Nothing happens.

1394
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:33,120
The dragon's wings do not come to save him
this time, nor does fire rain down from the

1395
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:34,120
heavens.

1396
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:39,620
Ilhan just keeps hitting him, perhaps with
even more strength than before.

1397
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:46,870
Timucin is afraid; as the punches get stronger,
he starts to worry that he may die.

1398
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:52,700
He blindly feels around for anything hard
and heavy that he can use to defend himself,

1399
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:56,160
and finds the hilt of his sword.

1400
02:02:56,160 --> 02:03:02,990
It sits neatly in the palm of his hand, it
is heavy and sharp and gives him a feeling

1401
02:03:02,990 --> 02:03:04,810
of safety.

1402
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:13,670
Even as Ilhan sits astride him raining down
blows, he knows he can stop it all with just

1403
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:17,180
one movement.

1404
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:24,340
Then the blood flowing to the floor will not
be his anymore.

1405
02:03:24,340 --> 02:03:31,190
Instead of using the sword, however, he drops
it again and calls desperately in his thoughts

1406
02:03:31,190 --> 02:03:33,240
for Sarantuya.

1407
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:35,940
Help me!

1408
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:39,150
The dragon remains silent.

1409
02:03:39,150 --> 02:03:46,880
Timucin can feel her presence so clearly,
as if she were right behind him, but she says

1410
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:48,790
nothing.

1411
02:03:48,790 --> 02:03:50,700
"Stop!"

1412
02:03:50,700 --> 02:03:54,430
shouts a furious, high-pitched voice.

1413
02:03:54,430 --> 02:04:01,050
Ilhan punches him in the face again, even
harder, but then his weight disappears from

1414
02:04:01,050 --> 02:04:08,690
Timucin's chest and Ilhan's mad laughter is
replaced by surprised shouts.

1415
02:04:08,690 --> 02:04:16,990
Timucin pushes himself up onto his elbows,
screws up his eyes to get rid of the blood

1416
02:04:16,990 --> 02:04:25,460
and tears and then opens them wide as he sees
who has come to help him.

1417
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:33,490
He has been counting on Chuzir, desperately
hoping for him, but his brother in oath is

1418
02:04:33,490 --> 02:04:37,890
standing looking lost and confused.

1419
02:04:37,890 --> 02:04:46,180
Now it is Ilhan who is lying on his back covering
his face with his hands;

1420
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:52,180
the form who is kneeling on him, smacking
him in the face again and again, is about

1421
02:04:52,180 --> 02:05:01,240
a head shorter than Timucin, has hip-length,
raven-black hair clinging to its skin in wet

1422
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:09,340
streaks, and is wearing nothing except this
hair - and water.

1423
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:13,170
"Leave him alone!"

1424
02:05:13,170 --> 02:05:18,980
screams Arbesa and every word is accompanied
by another slap.

1425
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:24,780
Ilhan's face is starting to turn red with
all the smacking, despite Arbesa's hands being

1426
02:05:24,780 --> 02:05:26,710
small and slim.

1427
02:05:26,710 --> 02:05:29,030
"You call that courage?

1428
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:31,460
Four on one?

1429
02:05:31,460 --> 02:05:37,660
You really are very brave warriors, aren't
you?!"

1430
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:43,950
Ilhan finally overcomes his surprise and throws
Arbesa off him with a rough movement.

1431
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:53,470
His face is glowing red and is contorted with
shame and fury; murderous rage is burning

1432
02:05:53,470 --> 02:05:54,790
in his eyes.

1433
02:05:54,790 --> 02:06:02,270
Timucin is almost completely sure than he
will lunge at him again, but instead Ilhan

1434
02:06:02,270 --> 02:06:08,030
takes a step back and spits blood and phlegm
on the grass.

1435
02:06:08,030 --> 02:06:17,200
"Yes," he says contemptuously, "I should apologise
to my khan; I did not know that his bodyguards

1436
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:19,940
were so brave."

1437
02:06:19,940 --> 02:06:27,550
With this, he turns on his heels and marches
off, followed by his three stooges.

1438
02:06:27,550 --> 02:06:37,590
Chuzir stands still, not sure what to do,
but does not look Timucin in the eyes.

1439
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:42,500
After a moment, he too goes, almost as fast
as the others.

1440
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:51,100
Timucin tries to get up, but everything is
spinning; his face hurts badly, every breath

1441
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:54,870
he takes causes him pain.

1442
02:06:54,870 --> 02:07:00,130
It feels like Ilhan may well have broken one
of his ribs.

1443
02:07:00,130 --> 02:07:08,540
He feels Arbesa kneel down beside him, stretch
out her hand to him, but she does not dare

1444
02:07:08,540 --> 02:07:10,780
to touch him.

1445
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:17,940
Then she does something, which surprises him
completely: she bends down to his face and

1446
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:22,470
blows a kiss on his cheek.

1447
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:29,770
"You were very brave, Timucin," she whispers
in his ear.

1448
02:07:29,770 --> 02:07:33,870
Timucin looks at her, confused.

1449
02:07:33,870 --> 02:07:36,040
He does not understand what she means.

1450
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,040
Brave?

1451
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:40,630
He has been a coward.

1452
02:07:40,630 --> 02:07:42,520
"What?" he murmurs.

1453
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:48,670
"It was brave of you not to do it."

1454
02:07:48,670 --> 02:07:52,550
Arbesa nods towards the sword.

1455
02:07:52,550 --> 02:08:00,650
She smiles, warmly and honestly, in a way
she has not smiled at him yet.

1456
02:08:00,650 --> 02:08:08,260
Then she stands up and, in one flowing movement,
puts out her hand to help him to his feet.

1457
02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:14,770
He is embarrassed, but he needs the help to
get up.

1458
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:20,770
He starts to thank her and is about to make
a jokey remark to try and play down his weakness

1459
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:28,300
when he notices movement behind him and jumps
round, convinced that Ilhan and the others

1460
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:32,270
have come back to give him another drubbing.

1461
02:08:32,270 --> 02:08:37,530
Instead, he sees his father.

1462
02:08:37,530 --> 02:08:44,630
Tamer stands before him, silent and stony-faced
between the trees.

1463
02:08:44,630 --> 02:08:55,220
Timucin understands that he has been there
for some time, has seen everything.

1464
02:08:55,220 --> 02:09:00,200
His father's stare cuts him like a knife.

1465
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:03,230
It is a look of contempt.

1466
02:09:03,230 --> 02:09:12,440
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Wisdom of the Dragons

1467
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:20,550
Why didn't you help me?" says Timucin to Sarantuya
as soon as he has closed his eyes and slid

1468
02:09:20,550 --> 02:09:23,720
over into his dream world.

1469
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:26,310
"I thought you were my friend!"

1470
02:09:26,310 --> 02:09:35,360
"I am," says the dragon, fluttering her eyelids,
"and you should count yourself lucky, too,

1471
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:37,930
if I may say so."

1472
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:41,740
"How so?" asks Timucin, annoyed.

1473
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:47,400
"Because you don't want me as your enemy,
little Khan.

1474
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:49,870
No one does."

1475
02:09:49,870 --> 02:09:56,730
For just a moment, there is something in her
eyes that he has never seen before, that he

1476
02:09:56,730 --> 02:10:06,370
has never felt in her before and that makes
him go ice- cold to the depth of his soul.

1477
02:10:06,370 --> 02:10:11,960
This feeling disappears too quickly for him
to become frightened, however, and Sarantuya

1478
02:10:11,960 --> 02:10:16,600
resumes her usual, wide dragon-smile.

1479
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:24,550
"And besides," she adds in a changed, almost
cheerful tone, "I did help you!"

1480
02:10:24,550 --> 02:10:25,550
"Ha!"

1481
02:10:25,550 --> 02:10:27,220
snorts Timucin.

1482
02:10:27,220 --> 02:10:34,700
"Did I not repel that bloodthirsty beast that
wanted to tear you to pieces?"

1483
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:39,620
"Do you mean that yapping little piece of
scum?"

1484
02:10:39,620 --> 02:10:42,070
replies Timucin with a dismissive tone.

1485
02:10:42,070 --> 02:10:49,400
"That was great of you, but I think I would
have just about been able to handle it, thanks."

1486
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:55,690
"Are you sure?" asks Sarantuya, mock clueless.

1487
02:10:55,690 --> 02:11:02,760
"You know exactly what I mean," snarls Timucin,
"although I didn't even want you to tear off

1488
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:05,570
their heads or anything like that."

1489
02:11:05,570 --> 02:11:09,020
"What did you want, then?"

1490
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:12,560
"Perhaps if you had just frightened them off
a bit.

1491
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:17,130
You know, filled their hearts with fear or
something of that nature."

1492
02:11:17,130 --> 02:11:24,350
"They are already so afraid that there is
no more room for fear," answers the dragon,

1493
02:11:24,350 --> 02:11:27,290
"but I know what you mean.

1494
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:33,170
It would have been just lovely if they had
run off scared and then thought that, they

1495
02:11:33,170 --> 02:11:34,960
were scared of you.

1496
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:37,760
Would you have liked that?"

1497
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:40,640
"Yes," answers Timucin.

1498
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:47,150
"So you like people to be afraid of you?"
asks the dragon.

1499
02:11:47,150 --> 02:11:54,920
Timucin is about to nod automatically, but
then he is not sure whether he really does

1500
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:57,930
want people to be afraid of him.

1501
02:11:57,930 --> 02:12:05,360
"I think you fought very bravely - well, for
a man.

1502
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:09,090
Not by dragon standards, of course..."

1503
02:12:09,090 --> 02:12:10,090
"What?

1504
02:12:10,090 --> 02:12:12,950
I just got punched the whole time!"

1505
02:12:12,950 --> 02:12:15,670
growls Timucin resentfully.

1506
02:12:15,670 --> 02:12:23,280
"Well, if I remember correctly, Ilhan got
the odd smack too!

1507
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:30,250
And believe you me, they hurt him far more
than the punches he gave you hurt you," says

1508
02:12:30,250 --> 02:12:38,250
the dragon, giggling, "because that kind of
lad really dislikes getting beaten up by a

1509
02:12:38,250 --> 02:12:39,780
girl!"

1510
02:12:39,780 --> 02:12:46,910
Not as much as I dislike being saved by one,
though, thinks Timucin.

1511
02:12:46,910 --> 02:12:53,740
Instinctively, he turns to the left, where
Arbesa is sleeping next to him.

1512
02:12:53,740 --> 02:13:00,800
He cannot actually see her in his dream world,
but he can still feel her presence.

1513
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:07,710
He feels warmth and comfort like he has not
felt since lying in his mother's arms as a

1514
02:13:07,710 --> 02:13:11,110
small boy, but this is different.

1515
02:13:11,110 --> 02:13:17,080
It is more intimate and much, much sweeter.

1516
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:25,930
Sarantuya does not try to even pretend that
she is not reading his thoughts.

1517
02:13:25,930 --> 02:13:35,240
"You are ashamed of being helped by a girl,
but you accuse me of not having helped, too!"

1518
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:39,660
"Yes, but you're a dragon, not a girl!"

1519
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:41,220
hisses Timucin.

1520
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:49,770
"But I was one, once," answers Sarantuya snappishly,
"and that wasn't all that long ago either.

1521
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:59,730
Those millennia just fly by..." she giggles
again, then sighs deeply and is suddenly very

1522
02:13:59,730 --> 02:14:01,140
serious again.

1523
02:14:01,140 --> 02:14:05,270
"You did not need any help, little Khan.

1524
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:08,640
You did everything right!"

1525
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:10,020
"Right?

1526
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:12,450
You mean I got a right beating!"

1527
02:14:12,450 --> 02:14:17,550
"You could have killed him.

1528
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:20,160
But you didn't."

1529
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:26,890
Timucin thinks of the sword he held in his
hand, thinks of the short but intense temptation;

1530
02:14:26,890 --> 02:14:34,300
the power it exercised for a brief moment
sends a shiver down his spine.

1531
02:14:34,300 --> 02:14:42,620
Perhaps this is the first time he has realised
just how thin the boundary is between life

1532
02:14:42,620 --> 02:14:43,800
and death.

1533
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:52,960
"It was right," repeats Sarantuya heavily,
"because a few scratches and cuts will heal,

1534
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:57,360
but you cannot give back a life you have taken.

1535
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:03,480
And sometimes the person who has taken it
becomes the person who is pursued."

1536
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:12,700
"Is this supposed to be the Wisdom of the
Dragons or something?" he asks angrily.

1537
02:15:12,700 --> 02:15:21,970
"No," answers Sarantuya, "just my experience
after a long life.

1538
02:15:21,970 --> 02:15:29,100
Nothing would have happened if you had killed
that boy, because you are the son of the khan,

1539
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:35,160
and he challenged you; but you may have never
forgotten him.

1540
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:36,160
Ever."

1541
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:40,430
"And what if I had forgotten him?"

1542
02:15:40,430 --> 02:15:52,240
"That would only have been worse," says Sarantuya
mysteriously, "because sometimes it is only

1543
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:58,550
a tiny step that puts a life onto the wrong
path.

1544
02:15:58,550 --> 02:16:02,660
But you did right."

1545
02:16:02,660 --> 02:16:08,460
Timucin is not in the mood for another round
of dragon wisdom.

1546
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:14,380
Not that Sarantuya is not in the right; he
knows she is.

1547
02:16:14,380 --> 02:16:19,920
"Yes, well... whatever the case, I learned
something important today."

1548
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:23,080
"What did you learn?"

1549
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:28,110
"That it might be nice to have friends, but
that's all there is.

1550
02:16:28,110 --> 02:16:31,850
When it comes down to it, you're on your own."

1551
02:16:31,850 --> 02:16:39,479
Sarantuya looks at him silently for a while,
and in such a strange way, that Timucin feels

1552
02:16:39,479 --> 02:16:42,289
more and more uncomfortable.

1553
02:16:42,289 --> 02:16:48,599
He only said what he just said to annoy her
slightly, but he realizes he has really hurt

1554
02:16:48,599 --> 02:16:49,949
her.

1555
02:16:49,949 --> 02:16:52,320
He did not mean to do that.

1556
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:57,200
"I meant Chuzir," he claims.

1557
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:04,349
"No," says Sarantuya, "no, you didn't."

1558
02:17:04,349 --> 02:17:07,949
Timucin is silent.

1559
02:17:07,949 --> 02:17:13,949
"I understand," says Sarantuya, sighing.

1560
02:17:13,949 --> 02:17:15,149
"What?"

1561
02:17:15,149 --> 02:17:22,229
Instead of answering his question, Sarantuya
just stares straight past him, as if the answer

1562
02:17:22,229 --> 02:17:28,920
is somewhere out there in the grey twilight
surrounding them.

1563
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:38,080
"There is something you should know, little
Khan," she says after a long while, "I did

1564
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:40,399
not finish my story last night.

1565
02:17:40,399 --> 02:17:48,090
I know that you beseeched me to help, but
I chose not to hear you."

1566
02:17:48,090 --> 02:17:49,269
"Why?"

1567
02:17:49,269 --> 02:17:57,739
"I have not yet told you why so few of us
chose to befriend your tribes- people and

1568
02:17:57,739 --> 02:17:59,659
make you into companions."

1569
02:17:59,659 --> 02:18:00,659
"Companions?

1570
02:18:00,659 --> 02:18:06,359
It sounds like we're married!"

1571
02:18:06,359 --> 02:18:13,010
He tries to laugh, but his joke does not have
any effect on Sarantuya, who stares at him

1572
02:18:13,010 --> 02:18:15,579
with a serious look.

1573
02:18:15,579 --> 02:18:25,609
"Well, we do marry you, in a way," she answers,
"because we enter into an eternal bond with

1574
02:18:25,609 --> 02:18:26,899
you.

1575
02:18:26,899 --> 02:18:33,359
If we choose to bind ourselves to one of you,
then we stay with you for life.

1576
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:41,969
Unless, that is, you take the wrong path;
even then, we have to grant you a last wish,

1577
02:18:41,969 --> 02:18:45,040
whatever it may be."

1578
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:49,910
"Whatever it may be?" says Timucin, making
sure.

1579
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:55,710
"You mean, I can wish for whatever I want
and I'll get it?

1580
02:18:55,710 --> 02:18:58,659
Whatever it may be?"

1581
02:18:58,659 --> 02:19:03,460
"Whatever it may be," repeats the dragon.

1582
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:05,659
She sounds sad.

1583
02:19:05,659 --> 02:19:09,809
"Be careful what you wish for, though.

1584
02:19:09,809 --> 02:19:21,179
You would never see me again, and you might
have to pay a terrible price."

1585
02:19:21,179 --> 02:19:28,639
What she says scares Timucin, and he is quite
sure that she means to do so, too.

1586
02:19:28,639 --> 02:19:34,239
Suddenly, however, Sarantuya bares her teeth
in a wide dragon-smile.

1587
02:19:34,239 --> 02:19:41,199
"Well, enough Wisdom of the Dragons for one
night?"

1588
02:19:41,199 --> 02:19:42,199
she asks cheer-fully.

1589
02:19:42,199 --> 02:19:52,560
Timucin is serious, however; he is still scared,
and Sarantuya's fake joviality just makes

1590
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:54,350
it worse.

1591
02:19:54,350 --> 02:20:00,270
He can tell that she is hiding something behind
it, and he can sense that he does not want

1592
02:20:00,270 --> 02:20:01,819
to know it.

1593
02:20:01,819 --> 02:20:10,250
"You haven't told me why you only reveal yourselves
to so few people," he says.

1594
02:20:10,250 --> 02:20:19,739
"We have been responsible for too much bad
in the world," answers the dragon, "because

1595
02:20:19,739 --> 02:20:22,859
you humans are clever.

1596
02:20:22,859 --> 02:20:28,700
You're all incredibly stupid, but very clever
too.

1597
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:36,399
After a while, too many people knew about
the last wish, and we had to grant them.

1598
02:20:36,399 --> 02:20:45,649
The temptation of unlimited power is great,
any only very few can withstand it.

1599
02:20:45,649 --> 02:20:56,220
Your world and your tribe have experienced
boundless suffering, wars and terrors and

1600
02:20:56,220 --> 02:21:04,010
death, and we presents.

1601
02:21:04,010 --> 02:21:12,859
So most of us have chosen to avoid people,
and only very few of us seek human companions."

1602
02:21:12,859 --> 02:21:18,510
"But you did," says Timucin.

1603
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:19,649
"Why?"

1604
02:21:19,649 --> 02:21:30,430
"Because I saw that you have real greatness
inside you, Timucin," she replies.

1605
02:21:30,430 --> 02:21:40,220
"Do not disappoint me, little Khan; the consequences
for your people would be grave."

1606
02:21:40,220 --> 02:21:47,039
CHAPTER NINE
Friendship

1607
02:21:47,039 --> 02:21:51,820
Belmin and his entourage stay for ten days.

1608
02:21:51,820 --> 02:21:58,710
As befits his rank and position as a great
khan and brother in oath to Timucin's father,

1609
02:21:58,710 --> 02:22:04,189
a feast is given every evening in Belmin's
honour.

1610
02:22:04,189 --> 02:22:11,239
The fire in his father's tent often burns
so long that its last light mingles with the

1611
02:22:11,239 --> 02:22:14,470
first rays of the rising sun.

1612
02:22:14,470 --> 02:22:21,670
Arbesa and Timucin spend every night in his
yurt, and although she then passes most of

1613
02:22:21,670 --> 02:22:28,591
the day avoiding him, either busy doing something
or chatting with the other women, they become

1614
02:22:28,591 --> 02:22:32,670
a lot closer to each other in this time.

1615
02:22:32,670 --> 02:22:38,770
They haven't touched each other at all, the
fleeting kiss as he lay on the ground that

1616
02:22:38,770 --> 02:22:43,880
first morning remains their only kiss.

1617
02:22:43,880 --> 02:22:52,619
She even seems afraid of any other contact,
although she does not seem to be prudish.

1618
02:22:52,619 --> 02:22:56,060
Something happens between them, however.

1619
02:22:56,060 --> 02:23:07,439
Timucin is not sure whether it is friendship
or love, but he feels good when she is there.

1620
02:23:07,439 --> 02:23:14,789
After a while, he misses the continual nagging
and frequently unfriendly scorn when she is

1621
02:23:14,789 --> 02:23:16,600
not there.

1622
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:24,189
At first, what Belmin said about him spending
a year in his village frightened him - Timucin

1623
02:23:24,189 --> 02:23:29,880
has never been away from his home for more
than a couple of days at a time - but now

1624
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:35,380
he is more afraid of not seeing Arbesa for
more than a day.

1625
02:23:35,380 --> 02:23:40,689
Not only does he now know that he will have
to spend the rest of the summer and the winter

1626
02:23:40,689 --> 02:23:48,010
to come in the Voshon village, but he is actually
looking forward to being there together with

1627
02:23:48,010 --> 02:23:49,490
Arbesa.

1628
02:23:49,490 --> 02:23:52,939
And so it comes to the last day.

1629
02:23:52,939 --> 02:24:01,360
Arbesa is already gone when he wakes up (Timucin
has not yet found out how she always manages

1630
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:08,010
to get up before him, even when he tries to
get up earlier), so Timucin leaves the yurt

1631
02:24:08,010 --> 02:24:14,479
and runs to the river to wash without his
armour hoping to find her there.

1632
02:24:14,479 --> 02:24:19,199
Instead, he finds Chuzir there.

1633
02:24:19,199 --> 02:24:26,600
His brother in oath is sitting on a rock on
the riverbank, his bare feet dangling in the

1634
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:27,770
water.

1635
02:24:27,770 --> 02:24:34,979
Timucin does not need to ask him to know that
he has been waiting for him for some time.

1636
02:24:34,979 --> 02:24:42,199
He wants to say something, but it is like
his throat has been sewn shut again.

1637
02:24:42,199 --> 02:24:48,079
Chuzir has avoided him over the last few days
with the same success as Arbesa.

1638
02:24:48,079 --> 02:24:56,029
Finally, however, Chuzir says something to
break the uncomfortable silence.

1639
02:24:56,029 --> 02:25:02,029
"Hello," he says, without turning round or
even looking up.

1640
02:25:02,029 --> 02:25:07,779
"Hello," replies Timucin, just as curtly.

1641
02:25:07,779 --> 02:25:14,060
He has not admitted it to himself, but he
has greatly desired to see his brother in

1642
02:25:14,060 --> 02:25:18,020
oath one more time before leaving the village.

1643
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:23,949
Now that he sees him, though, he does not
know what to say.

1644
02:25:23,949 --> 02:25:28,630
He wants to slap himself until the words he
has so carefully considered over the last

1645
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:32,260
days come out, but they don't.

1646
02:25:32,260 --> 02:25:40,930
"Today is the big day," says Chuzir after
the silence threatens to become too heavy.

1647
02:25:40,930 --> 02:25:46,390
He is still looking away from Timucin with
his feet in the water and has something lying

1648
02:25:46,390 --> 02:25:50,630
on his thighs that Timucin cannot see.

1649
02:25:50,630 --> 02:25:56,210
Timucin wants to step closer, but for some
reason feels, he cannot.

1650
02:25:56,210 --> 02:25:59,270
"Yes," he answers.

1651
02:25:59,270 --> 02:26:05,510
"They are already saddling up the horses,"
continues Chuzir.

1652
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:13,050
To be exact, they had already started saddling
them yesterday evening, and both of them know

1653
02:26:13,050 --> 02:26:14,050
it.

1654
02:26:14,050 --> 02:26:15,910
"We are starting off early.

1655
02:26:15,910 --> 02:26:19,250
It is a long ride."

1656
02:26:19,250 --> 02:26:23,220
"Yes, long indeed.

1657
02:26:23,220 --> 02:26:28,109
You won't be back until next spring, if at
all."

1658
02:26:28,109 --> 02:26:31,399
"What do you mean?" asks Timucin.

1659
02:26:31,399 --> 02:26:34,840
"I will come back, of course I will come back."

1660
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:41,420
"And what if the girl does not want to?" asks
Chuzir.

1661
02:26:41,420 --> 02:26:48,960
"The girl" he replies, a little strongly in
tone, "is my betrothed.

1662
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:53,300
I shall return with her before the year is
out."

1663
02:26:53,300 --> 02:27:00,460
"Unless she does not want to leave her people
and persuades you to stay," says Chuzir.

1664
02:27:00,460 --> 02:27:04,159
"Women are good at that sort of thing."

1665
02:27:04,159 --> 02:27:05,159
"Nonsense!"

1666
02:27:05,159 --> 02:27:06,529
replies Timucin.

1667
02:27:06,529 --> 02:27:10,010
"My father would never allow it."

1668
02:27:10,010 --> 02:27:12,569
Chuzir stares at the river for a while.

1669
02:27:12,569 --> 02:27:17,069
The starlight is dancing on it.

1670
02:27:17,069 --> 02:27:21,529
"Yes," he sighs, "you are right.

1671
02:27:21,529 --> 02:27:23,600
He would never let that happen."

1672
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:32,970
His voice is full of bitterness, and at first
Timucin does not understand it.

1673
02:27:32,970 --> 02:27:35,749
Then he sucks air through his teeth.

1674
02:27:35,749 --> 02:27:40,579
"I do not believe it!

1675
02:27:40,579 --> 02:27:44,130
You are jealous of Arbesa!"

1676
02:27:44,130 --> 02:27:45,710
"Rubbish!"

1677
02:27:45,710 --> 02:27:47,699
replies Chuzir flatly.

1678
02:27:47,699 --> 02:27:49,590
"It's just that..."

1679
02:27:49,590 --> 02:27:55,640
He needs a moment to find the right words,
and keeps looking at the river.

1680
02:27:55,640 --> 02:28:01,260
"It's just that I don't want to lose you.

1681
02:28:01,260 --> 02:28:03,300
We are friends."

1682
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:09,550
Timucin is as relieved as he is confused by
this statement.

1683
02:28:09,550 --> 02:28:15,029
In fact, he is so confused that he is slightly
angry.

1684
02:28:15,029 --> 02:28:22,949
"I shall return before a year is out," he
replies sharply, "and we are more than friends:

1685
02:28:22,949 --> 02:28:24,479
we are brothers in oath."

1686
02:28:24,479 --> 02:28:31,970
Well, I hope we still are, he adds in his
thoughts.

1687
02:28:31,970 --> 02:28:37,479
On this, Chuzir turns round to face him and
says something that scares Timucin.

1688
02:28:37,479 --> 02:28:40,159
"Are we still brothers in oath?"

1689
02:28:40,159 --> 02:28:42,729
"What do you mean?"

1690
02:28:42,729 --> 02:28:46,170
responds Timucin roughly.

1691
02:28:46,170 --> 02:28:51,739
Chuzir takes his feet out of the water and
turns slowly towards him until Timucin can

1692
02:28:51,739 --> 02:28:54,659
see what he has in his lap.

1693
02:28:54,659 --> 02:28:57,680
His eyes widen.

1694
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:04,880
"I've been waiting for you because I wanted
to speak to you alone and to give you this,

1695
02:29:04,880 --> 02:29:07,260
if you want it back."

1696
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:10,060
He holds up the arrow to Timucin.

1697
02:29:10,060 --> 02:29:13,530
"Have you lost your mind?"

1698
02:29:13,530 --> 02:29:14,920
gasps Timucin.

1699
02:29:14,920 --> 02:29:17,350
"We swore our oath on this arrow."

1700
02:29:17,350 --> 02:29:25,180
"I am not worthy of it," replies Chuzir quietly.

1701
02:29:25,180 --> 02:29:31,420
"I betrayed you and did not stand by you when
you needed my help.

1702
02:29:31,420 --> 02:29:36,850
I would understand if you want to undo our
oath."

1703
02:29:36,850 --> 02:29:43,080
For a moment, Timucin wants to grab the arrow
out of his hands - not to break it and so

1704
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:51,870
to undo this oath made for all eternity - but
to slap Chuzir in the face for being so stupid.

1705
02:29:51,870 --> 02:29:55,330
"You have gone mad," he says.

1706
02:29:55,330 --> 02:30:01,020
"I will go mad with anger if you do not put
away this arrow right now.

1707
02:30:01,020 --> 02:30:02,739
How did you betray me?"

1708
02:30:02,739 --> 02:30:06,909
"I should not have told the others about your
fear of dogs."

1709
02:30:06,909 --> 02:30:13,529
"That is true," says Timucin, "so you owe
me one, then?"

1710
02:30:13,529 --> 02:30:15,840
He grins.

1711
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:19,450
Chuzir looks up at him uncertainly.

1712
02:30:19,450 --> 02:30:28,420
His hand, in which the arrow is resting, is
trembling ever so slightly, but a faint glimmer

1713
02:30:28,420 --> 02:30:31,840
of hope comes into his eyes.

1714
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:42,479
It is still quite dark, so Timucin cannot
be sure, but he thinks he sees tears glinting

1715
02:30:42,479 --> 02:30:44,010
in the starlight.

1716
02:30:44,010 --> 02:30:52,670
"And there was no point trying to help against
Ilhan," he says, grinning even wider, "because

1717
02:30:52,670 --> 02:30:57,499
I had a great bodyguard... and if you say
any more stupid things about our friendship

1718
02:30:57,499 --> 02:31:01,819
being over, I'll set her on you!"

1719
02:31:01,819 --> 02:31:07,819
"So you forgive me, then?" asks Chuzir shyly.

1720
02:31:07,819 --> 02:31:12,470
"There is nothing to forgive," says Timucin
fiercely.

1721
02:31:12,470 --> 02:31:19,949
Then he takes the arrow out of Chuzir's hand
and lays it carefully on the ground.

1722
02:31:19,949 --> 02:31:25,659
Chuzir looks closely at Timucin, as if he
is looking for traces of malice or a grudge

1723
02:31:25,659 --> 02:31:27,710
in his face.

1724
02:31:27,710 --> 02:31:32,340
"And what about Ilhan and the others?" he
asks.

1725
02:31:32,340 --> 02:31:40,220
"You keep an eye on them for me until I return,"
replies Timucin, mock strict and winking conspiratorially.

1726
02:31:40,220 --> 02:31:48,289
"Can you keep a secret?" he asks Chuzir, who
nods.

1727
02:31:48,289 --> 02:31:54,430
"When I come back with Arbesa, we won't be
alone."

1728
02:31:54,430 --> 02:32:00,810
"What do you mean?" asks Chuzir, wide-eyed.

1729
02:32:00,810 --> 02:32:08,479
"I've already spoken with Arbesa's father,
and he is going to help me," continues Timucin.

1730
02:32:08,479 --> 02:32:13,899
Chuzir's eyes get even wider and his jaw drops.

1731
02:32:13,899 --> 02:32:20,960
"There are lots of puppies in his village
and he has promised to give me one that I

1732
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:22,930
can raise," says Timucin.

1733
02:32:22,930 --> 02:32:30,660
"When I come back, I will have the biggest,
wildest dog you can imagine!"

1734
02:32:30,660 --> 02:32:37,590
Chuzir looks at him in surprise for a moment
longer, then he starts to laugh loudly.

1735
02:32:37,590 --> 02:32:44,149
Finally, they hug and return hand in hand
to the village.

1736
02:32:44,149 --> 02:32:53,100
The others are already waiting for them; a
few moments later, Timucin leaves the village.

1737
02:32:53,100 --> 02:33:01,680
CHAPTER TEN
Bajar and Batu

1738
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:08,640
Almost nine months later to the day, Timucin
returns, just as he has promised his brother

1739
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:11,090
in oath he will.

1740
02:33:11,090 --> 02:33:18,189
This time, there is no huge baggage train
approaching the dozen yurts of his home village,

1741
02:33:18,189 --> 02:33:25,569
nestling next to the hill on the banks of
the Omon; it is just he, Arbesa and their

1742
02:33:25,569 --> 02:33:29,789
two loyal bodyguards.

1743
02:33:29,789 --> 02:33:36,070
Despite his tribe's peaceful nature and the
fact that there are no animosities with any

1744
02:33:36,070 --> 02:33:44,000
of the neighboring tribes, Arbesa's father
insists on these two accompanying the couple.

1745
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:54,819
Two further bodyguards are present, too - Bajar
and Batu, the two huge black dogs that Timucin

1746
02:33:54,819 --> 02:34:01,289
has raised in the preceding months and which
follow him everywhere he goes.

1747
02:34:01,289 --> 02:34:05,050
Their arrival does not go unnoticed.

1748
02:34:05,050 --> 02:34:12,989
Timucin's sharp eyes and ears tell him that
they are being followed by lookouts, but they

1749
02:34:12,989 --> 02:34:15,890
have not come with bad intentions.

1750
02:34:15,890 --> 02:34:21,600
They are just watching them, not planning
to ambush them.

1751
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:26,949
When they are about two arrow-flights away
from the village, a small troop of riders

1752
02:34:26,949 --> 02:34:28,649
approaches them.

1753
02:34:28,649 --> 02:34:35,930
Timucin sees from a long way off that his
father is not one of them.

1754
02:34:35,930 --> 02:34:41,979
He is a little disappointed, but not too badly,
and the feeling goes as quickly as it has

1755
02:34:41,979 --> 02:34:43,390
come.

1756
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:47,560
After all, they saw each other but ten days
ago.

1757
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:53,249
As is custom in the two tribes, his father
visited the father of the bride at the end

1758
02:34:53,249 --> 02:34:59,229
of the engagement period to discuss the final
details of the wedding.

1759
02:34:59,229 --> 02:35:05,859
Then he returned earlier in order to prepare
the great feast in Timucin's village.

1760
02:35:05,859 --> 02:35:12,939
Belmin and the great men of his tribe are
to arrive later, at which time Timucin and

1761
02:35:12,939 --> 02:35:19,689
Arbesa will marry and the bond between the
two tribes will become official.

1762
02:35:19,689 --> 02:35:24,890
Timucin is looking forward to this day.

1763
02:35:24,890 --> 02:35:31,140
In the months past, they have not been apart
for a single day, and he now knows Arbesa

1764
02:35:31,140 --> 02:35:34,880
as well as anyone can know another person.

1765
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:42,890
Yet it will be different once they are married,
the only son and the only daughter of two

1766
02:35:42,890 --> 02:35:44,100
khans.

1767
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:51,609
Timucin has learned a lot from Arbesa and
her people, and perhaps Arbesa has learnt

1768
02:35:51,609 --> 02:35:54,699
the odd thing from him.

1769
02:35:54,699 --> 02:36:00,110
Although they have never said it, they both
know how their future together will be.

1770
02:36:00,110 --> 02:36:08,159
After many years, hopefully very many years,
Belmin and Tamer will be called to the gods,

1771
02:36:08,159 --> 02:36:14,770
and then they will unite their two tribes
and make a new and more powerful one, one

1772
02:36:14,770 --> 02:36:20,319
which is not ruled by a man of the sword,
but by a man of wisdom.

1773
02:36:20,319 --> 02:36:27,950
It will be a tribe of prosperous farmers and
artisans, not of warriors and pillagers.

1774
02:36:27,950 --> 02:36:32,689
But this is a long way in the future.

1775
02:36:32,689 --> 02:36:39,220
Arbesa steers her pony closer to Timucin's
horse and points to the riders approaching.

1776
02:36:39,220 --> 02:36:43,390
"Your father is not coming to welcome us?"

1777
02:36:43,390 --> 02:36:50,979
"He is the khan and a very busy man," answers
Timucin with a touch of mockery, "and we are

1778
02:36:50,979 --> 02:36:52,940
only children."

1779
02:36:52,940 --> 02:36:58,840
"Yes, and your mother will probably tear his
head off if he doesn't bring you home as quickly

1780
02:36:58,840 --> 02:36:59,840
as possible.

1781
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:04,399
I certainly would, if I had not seen my only
son for so long."

1782
02:37:04,399 --> 02:37:12,670
"Yes, well," sighs Timucin, "my mother is
an obedient woman and knows to respect her

1783
02:37:12,670 --> 02:37:14,040
husband."

1784
02:37:14,040 --> 02:37:20,720
"Then maybe you should marry her," says Arbesa
with a straight face.

1785
02:37:20,720 --> 02:37:27,729
Timucin is about to reply with a jokey answer,
but now he sees the riders come closer and

1786
02:37:27,729 --> 02:37:30,739
recognizes Chuzir.

1787
02:37:30,739 --> 02:37:35,030
He shouts out his name and dashes off towards
him.

1788
02:37:35,030 --> 02:37:39,520
The two dogs follow him, barking excitedly.

1789
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:48,430
Arbesa falls back, although Timucin knows
that she could ride just as fast if she wanted.

1790
02:37:48,430 --> 02:37:54,510
The three riders also increase their speed,
and Chuzir waves at Timucin, who sees that

1791
02:37:54,510 --> 02:38:02,189
his brother in oath has his bow on the saddle
and the arrow in his quiver - just their arrow.

1792
02:38:02,189 --> 02:38:09,899
His two companions hold their horses back
as they draw nearer, so that only Timucin

1793
02:38:09,899 --> 02:38:15,689
and Chuzir are approaching one another, like
two knights dueling.

1794
02:38:15,689 --> 02:38:21,409
Indeed it seems that neither wants to be the
one to stop, and it is only at the last minute

1795
02:38:21,409 --> 02:38:26,890
that both of them tear their horses out of
the gallop and pass by each other closely

1796
02:38:26,890 --> 02:38:32,110
enough for Timucin's left knee to touch Chuzir's.

1797
02:38:32,110 --> 02:38:40,550
He yanks so hard at the bridle that the horse
neighs angrily and stands on its hind legs,

1798
02:38:40,550 --> 02:38:42,500
turning round instantly.

1799
02:38:42,500 --> 02:38:47,200
Chuzir does exactly the same.

1800
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:56,340
They approach each other like two warriors,
but embrace as friends, bending in their saddles.

1801
02:38:56,340 --> 02:39:02,840
Timucin almost falls from his, due to the
force of Chuzir's embrace.

1802
02:39:02,840 --> 02:39:08,720
His two dogs run around yapping and growling,
but seem to have understood that this was

1803
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:13,270
not meant to be a fight and wag their tails.

1804
02:39:13,270 --> 02:39:19,850
For a while, the two friends just laugh happily,
pat each other on the shoulder, or prod and

1805
02:39:19,850 --> 02:39:26,279
poke one another until Timucin notices that
their friendly exchange of blows threatens

1806
02:39:26,279 --> 02:39:30,479
to become less friendly, and stops.

1807
02:39:30,479 --> 02:39:38,670
"And so this is how you greet your future
khan?" he asks, laughing.

1808
02:39:38,670 --> 02:39:41,850
"No, this is how I greet an old friend!

1809
02:39:41,850 --> 02:39:45,760
An old friend who can still ride a horse as
well as ever!"

1810
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:49,310
"I let you off lightly," replies Timucin.

1811
02:39:49,310 --> 02:39:53,420
"It wouldn't have been fair to put you to
shame after we haven't seen each other for

1812
02:39:53,420 --> 02:39:55,659
so long!"

1813
02:39:55,659 --> 02:40:01,249
Chuzir's horse starts to get restless and
he has to calm it back down.

1814
02:40:01,249 --> 02:40:07,399
Timucin uses the time to have a good look
at his old friend.

1815
02:40:07,399 --> 02:40:14,039
He has not been away for a full year, and
yet his friend seems to have grown up a lot.

1816
02:40:14,039 --> 02:40:22,540
His shoulders have got broader, he is quite
a bit taller and he is also far more muscular.

1817
02:40:22,540 --> 02:40:29,989
Then he sees that he too must look different
to Chuzir; even he himself has noticed changes

1818
02:40:29,989 --> 02:40:31,590
in recent months.

1819
02:40:31,590 --> 02:40:37,659
He too has grown - a lot more than Chuzir
- and his shoulders too are broader.

1820
02:40:37,659 --> 02:40:43,990
He is far better built than he was, and his
voice has become a lot deeper.

1821
02:40:43,990 --> 02:40:49,180
That is almost certainly due to the way he
has been living.

1822
02:40:49,180 --> 02:40:53,779
Belmin's tribe is not just peaceful, but very
wealthy.

1823
02:40:53,779 --> 02:41:01,630
They eat well every day, their yurts are never
cold, and he has learnt to eat other things

1824
02:41:01,630 --> 02:41:08,729
than lamb and mutton that he would never have
tried before - even if he was reluctant at

1825
02:41:08,729 --> 02:41:10,069
first.

1826
02:41:10,069 --> 02:41:19,350
And once he got used to them, these new foodstuffs
not only tasted good, but did him good, too.

1827
02:41:19,350 --> 02:41:27,390
That is only one reason behind the change,
though, another being Arbesa, in whose presence

1828
02:41:27,390 --> 02:41:31,459
he really comes into his own.

1829
02:41:31,459 --> 02:41:37,499
The third, and perhaps most important thing,
is something that he cannot put his finger

1830
02:41:37,499 --> 02:41:42,109
on, something that cannot be described.

1831
02:41:42,109 --> 02:41:51,130
It is the peaceful life of the Voshon, a life
free of fear and fighting and war and blood.

1832
02:41:51,130 --> 02:41:59,130
It soothes his soul, and affects his body
in a good way.

1833
02:41:59,130 --> 02:42:08,770
In just a few days, you will be a married
man, a silent voice says, teasing him, but

1834
02:42:08,770 --> 02:42:11,409
don't overdo it.

1835
02:42:11,409 --> 02:42:15,159
Enjoy the time that you are still a boy.

1836
02:42:15,159 --> 02:42:19,610
Later, you will wish you still were!

1837
02:42:19,610 --> 02:42:27,180
He is about to turn in his saddle and give
Arbesa a look, he is used to her little speeches,

1838
02:42:27,180 --> 02:42:31,340
but he has asked her to leave off a little
for the first few months.

1839
02:42:31,340 --> 02:42:38,140
It has taken him some time to realise that
her apparently rude way of talking to him

1840
02:42:38,140 --> 02:42:43,680
is her manner of showing her affection, and
he knows that his friends and people in the

1841
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:47,890
tribe will not understand this straight away.

1842
02:42:47,890 --> 02:42:53,170
He suddenly realizes that the voice is Sarantuya's,
though.

1843
02:42:53,170 --> 02:42:59,020
Recently, the dragon has started talking to
him more often during daylight hours as well

1844
02:42:59,020 --> 02:43:01,289
as in his dreams.

1845
02:43:01,289 --> 02:43:07,970
And her voice seems to be getting more and
more similar to Arbesa's.

1846
02:43:07,970 --> 02:43:17,149
Well, it is becoming as sarcastic in any case.

1847
02:43:17,149 --> 02:43:25,119
Behind him, he hears a high-pitched and mildly
scornful laugh and, as Chuzir gets his horse

1848
02:43:25,119 --> 02:43:32,399
back under control and looks up, he is looking
directly at Arbesa's face.

1849
02:43:32,399 --> 02:43:39,569
Unlike for her first visit, Arbesa has not
worn a veil, and Timucin is visibly amused

1850
02:43:39,569 --> 02:43:44,310
by the effect Arbesa's face has on Chuzir.

1851
02:43:44,310 --> 02:43:51,640
He is looking at somebody he has last seen
as a girl, and who is now a woman.

1852
02:43:51,640 --> 02:43:58,780
"Don't believe a word this silly boy says,"
jokes Arbesa, "my father found the most peaceful

1853
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:05,739
horse in the whole tribe; otherwise, he probably
wouldn't have made it here!"

1854
02:44:05,739 --> 02:44:14,609
So Arbesa is clearly not going to play the
obedient wife, not even on her first day.

1855
02:44:14,609 --> 02:44:23,229
Timucin sighs silently to himself and hears
a silent laugh behind his forehead.

1856
02:44:23,229 --> 02:44:30,989
Chuzir laughs and, for a moment, Timucin has
the impression that a shadow has come over

1857
02:44:30,989 --> 02:44:32,989
his face.

1858
02:44:32,989 --> 02:44:40,070
It disappears again very quickly and he is
not sure it really was there.

1859
02:44:40,070 --> 02:44:45,689
"Arbesa," replies Chuzir, "I am pleased to
see you again."

1860
02:44:45,689 --> 02:44:53,229
Arbesa replies pleasantly and then she and
Chuzir exchange polite greetings.

1861
02:44:53,229 --> 02:45:00,079
Arbesa starts to tease him too just like she
does Timucin, who uses this time to size up

1862
02:45:00,079 --> 02:45:02,020
the rest of the group.

1863
02:45:02,020 --> 02:45:08,960
He is overjoyed to see his arrow in Chuzir's
quiver; perhaps Chuzir took it with him deliberately,

1864
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:15,350
and Timucin is angry at himself for not having
thought of taking his oath-arrow, too.

1865
02:45:15,350 --> 02:45:19,989
Yet Chuzir is bound to understand this.

1866
02:45:19,989 --> 02:45:26,779
In any case, if the look in his eyes is anything
to go by, he is too happy to see Timucin to

1867
02:45:26,779 --> 02:45:30,699
think about little details like that.

1868
02:45:30,699 --> 02:45:38,560
He tears his gaze away from Chuzir and looks
at the other two riders, who have stayed back

1869
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:41,800
at a respectful distance.

1870
02:45:41,800 --> 02:45:48,920
He is surprised to see that one of them is
Ilhan, and is not sure whether this is a good

1871
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:51,300
or a bad thing.

1872
02:45:51,300 --> 02:45:59,060
In contrast to Chuzir, he does not seem to
have changed at all and still looks how Timucin

1873
02:45:59,060 --> 02:46:05,680
remembers him: a thin, tall fellow with a
mean face and malicious eyes.

1874
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:13,189
The only difference, however, is that he is
looking at Timucin with respect; no trace

1875
02:46:13,189 --> 02:46:19,239
of friendliness at all, but respect nonetheless.

1876
02:46:19,239 --> 02:46:25,670
The other rider with him was also at the riverbank
that day, and he is not looking at Timucin

1877
02:46:25,670 --> 02:46:32,240
at all, but is staring wide-eyed at his two
huge dogs.

1878
02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:38,300
They are weaving in and out of the horses'
legs, wagging their tails when they look up

1879
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:45,600
at Timucin, Arbesa and Chuzir and growling
and baring their tremendous teeth when they

1880
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:48,920
look at Ilhan and the other boy.

1881
02:46:48,920 --> 02:46:55,709
Timucin briefly grins, but does not think
any further about what he might do; he will

1882
02:46:55,709 --> 02:46:59,789
have plenty of time to pay them back for what
they did.

1883
02:46:59,789 --> 02:47:04,439
For the moment, there are more important things
to do.

1884
02:47:04,439 --> 02:47:09,100
And do you really need to pay them back?

1885
02:47:09,100 --> 02:47:12,939
adds Sarantuya silently.

1886
02:47:12,939 --> 02:47:16,249
No, not really.

1887
02:47:16,249 --> 02:47:22,859
Timucin decides that Chuzir has spent enough
time suffering his future wife's cheerful

1888
02:47:22,859 --> 02:47:28,560
teasing - for now, at least - and pushes his
horse in between their steeds, pretending

1889
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:30,810
to be strict with his friend.

1890
02:47:30,810 --> 02:47:36,869
"If I did not know better," he growls, "I
should think you were courting my future wife!

1891
02:47:36,869 --> 02:47:41,260
But you would never do a thing like that,
would you?"

1892
02:47:41,260 --> 02:47:49,789
"Never!" says Chuzir, making an injured face
and adding with a loud whisper: "Well, not

1893
02:47:49,789 --> 02:47:52,670
when you are around!"

1894
02:47:52,670 --> 02:48:00,779
Arbesa - and Sarantuya too - find this funny
and laugh; Chuzir too starts to laugh out

1895
02:48:00,779 --> 02:48:06,520
loud, and Timucin pretends to be even stricter
and turns to the two riders.

1896
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:09,489
"Accompany my bride to the village.

1897
02:48:09,489 --> 02:48:15,529
I have some business to take care of with
this utter rogue here!"

1898
02:48:15,529 --> 02:48:21,890
He follows this little joke with a fully overdone
commanding gesture.

1899
02:48:21,890 --> 02:48:27,820
Chuzir grins at him, but the other two immediately
start off on their horses and try to flank

1900
02:48:27,820 --> 02:48:29,340
Arbesa's pony.

1901
02:48:29,340 --> 02:48:32,370
Ilhan makes an almost ridiculously low bow.

1902
02:48:32,370 --> 02:48:38,499
"As you wish, my Khan."

1903
02:48:38,499 --> 02:48:41,949
Timucin frowns.

1904
02:48:41,949 --> 02:48:45,949
They must have said that to make fun of him.

1905
02:48:45,949 --> 02:48:53,749
Yet they are frightfully respectful about
it; in fact, they seem almost afraid of him.

1906
02:48:53,749 --> 02:48:58,079
The second boy still will not look at him.

1907
02:48:58,079 --> 02:49:02,819
Something is not right here.

1908
02:49:02,819 --> 02:49:09,670
He remains silent, however, until Arbesa and
her bodyguards - all four of them - have started

1909
02:49:09,670 --> 02:49:13,670
for the village and are a good distance away.

1910
02:49:13,670 --> 02:49:21,069
Then he turns in his saddle to Chuzir and,
with a puzzled expression, asks him something.

1911
02:49:21,069 --> 02:49:28,880
"What did you do to them to make them so friendly
to me all of a sudden?"

1912
02:49:28,880 --> 02:49:31,189
Chuzir does not answer.

1913
02:49:31,189 --> 02:49:37,510
The elation of the morning melts away with
the first rays of the sun.

1914
02:49:37,510 --> 02:49:43,250
Timucin repeats the question, now very seriously.

1915
02:49:43,250 --> 02:49:47,310
"What is going on here, Chuzir.

1916
02:49:47,310 --> 02:49:52,779
Why is he calling me... khan?"

1917
02:49:52,779 --> 02:50:02,359
Chuzir avoids his gaze, lets three, maybe
four heartbeats go by that seem like an eternity,

1918
02:50:02,359 --> 02:50:04,260
and then speaks.

1919
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:10,130
"Because you are khan, Timucin."

1920
02:50:10,130 --> 02:50:13,229
"What do you mean?"

1921
02:50:13,229 --> 02:50:20,729
Timucin's voice sounds more frightened than
he actually is; he does not really understand

1922
02:50:20,729 --> 02:50:22,750
what Chuzir's answer means.

1923
02:50:22,750 --> 02:50:27,369
Or maybe he does not want to understand it.

1924
02:50:27,369 --> 02:50:34,930
His thoughts are suddenly more tense than
ever, and the tension is not coming from him.

1925
02:50:34,930 --> 02:50:43,880
Something else is inside him, listening, terrified,
and scared of what is to come.

1926
02:50:43,880 --> 02:50:53,229
"Where is my father?" asks Timucin once he
realizes that Chuzir will not answer of his

1927
02:50:53,229 --> 02:50:54,399
own accord.

1928
02:50:54,399 --> 02:50:58,170
His brother in oath is still avoiding his
gaze.

1929
02:50:58,170 --> 02:51:03,609
"He is not here," Chuzir says then.

1930
02:51:03,609 --> 02:51:05,550
"Not here?!"

1931
02:51:05,550 --> 02:51:10,810
Timucin sits up in his saddle, straight as
an arrow.

1932
02:51:10,810 --> 02:51:13,369
"What do you mean?

1933
02:51:13,369 --> 02:51:16,039
He rode out before us just ten days ago."

1934
02:51:16,039 --> 02:51:23,409
"I know," interrupts Chuzir, turning slowly
in his saddle to face his brother in oath.

1935
02:51:23,409 --> 02:51:27,989
Timucin can see how difficult this is for
him.

1936
02:51:27,989 --> 02:51:32,680
"He did not arrive, Timucin.

1937
02:51:32,680 --> 02:51:35,459
I'm sorry."

1938
02:51:35,459 --> 02:51:38,239
"Not arrived?

1939
02:51:38,239 --> 02:51:39,659
What's that supposed to mean?

1940
02:51:39,659 --> 02:51:43,239
Do not talk to me in riddles, Chuzir!

1941
02:51:43,239 --> 02:51:45,079
What happened?"

1942
02:51:45,079 --> 02:51:49,779
"The Tatars," answers Chuzir.

1943
02:51:49,779 --> 02:52:01,359
An icy hand takes hold of Timucin's heart
and seems to crush it, slowly but mercilessly.

1944
02:52:01,359 --> 02:52:06,420
He tries to say something, but cannot speak
a word.

1945
02:52:06,420 --> 02:52:08,239
He is horrified.

1946
02:52:08,239 --> 02:52:15,890
"The Tatars?" he whispers back, after a while.

1947
02:52:15,890 --> 02:52:16,890
"But...

1948
02:52:16,890 --> 02:52:17,890
why?

1949
02:52:17,890 --> 02:52:20,830
I mean... how?"

1950
02:52:20,830 --> 02:52:26,229
Chuzir holds his gaze, but it costs him strength.

1951
02:52:26,229 --> 02:52:29,770
His voice trembles as he talks.

1952
02:52:29,770 --> 02:52:34,369
"We don't know exactly how.

1953
02:52:34,369 --> 02:52:39,459
He has been taken prisoner; that is all they
have told us."

1954
02:52:39,459 --> 02:52:46,310
"But he is alive?" asks Timucin.

1955
02:52:46,310 --> 02:52:53,109
Chuzir hesitates too long for his answer to
sound as convincing as Timucin would like.

1956
02:52:53,109 --> 02:52:57,430
"Probably," he says after some time.

1957
02:52:57,430 --> 02:52:59,630
He tries a laugh.

1958
02:52:59,630 --> 02:53:06,029
"You know what cowards they are; they are
hoping that we will pay a great ransom, and

1959
02:53:06,029 --> 02:53:12,380
as long as they think that we will give them
gold and livestock, they will not touch him."

1960
02:53:12,380 --> 02:53:15,869
Timucin stares at him.

1961
02:53:15,869 --> 02:53:23,959
A feeling of strange, crippling pain starts
to spread inside him.

1962
02:53:23,959 --> 02:53:25,539
His father?

1963
02:53:25,539 --> 02:53:26,539
Prisoner?

1964
02:53:26,539 --> 02:53:29,189
That is impossible!

1965
02:53:29,189 --> 02:53:31,840
And it is not...

1966
02:53:31,840 --> 02:53:34,489
right, either!

1967
02:53:34,489 --> 02:53:43,699
Suddenly, it is as if he is waking up from
a dream, a dream that has been long and sweet,

1968
02:53:43,699 --> 02:53:48,279
a dream in which the world was peaceful.

1969
02:53:48,279 --> 02:53:54,359
It is too beautiful to be true, and his awakening
is all the more painful.

1970
02:53:54,359 --> 02:53:58,529
"Why did you not tell me?

1971
02:53:58,529 --> 02:54:00,560
You should have sent a messenger!"

1972
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:09,499
"We only heard yesterday," answers Chuzir,
not defensively, but quietly and sympathetic.

1973
02:54:09,499 --> 02:54:18,779
"The elders came together and sent a messenger
to the Tatars to ask about their conditions.

1974
02:54:18,779 --> 02:54:26,010
He has not yet returned - but this is no reason
to worry", he adds hastily, almost frightened.

1975
02:54:26,010 --> 02:54:28,880
"It is a long way to travel.

1976
02:54:28,880 --> 02:54:33,409
He will be here at sundown at the very earliest."

1977
02:54:33,409 --> 02:54:38,249
Timucin closes his eyes.

1978
02:54:38,249 --> 02:54:45,199
The feeling of having left a beautiful dream
for an equally horrible nightmare is still

1979
02:54:45,199 --> 02:54:46,959
there.

1980
02:54:46,959 --> 02:54:55,250
He is filled with cold horror, and with something
else that he recoils from, something that

1981
02:54:55,250 --> 02:54:59,300
he does not want to recognise.

1982
02:54:59,300 --> 02:55:08,729
Something is stirring in his thoughts, something
big and powerful, whispering to him in an

1983
02:55:08,729 --> 02:55:12,130
inaudible and comforting voice.

1984
02:55:12,130 --> 02:55:17,010
Yet he does not want to hear the words that
are being spoken.

1985
02:55:17,010 --> 02:55:23,149
He tries to think of his father, but this
makes him shiver.

1986
02:55:23,149 --> 02:55:29,140
They spoke to each other just a few days ago,
yet the picture in his mind is of Tamer's

1987
02:55:29,140 --> 02:55:36,489
face as it appeared to him that morning on
the riverbank, his face as he watched his

1988
02:55:36,489 --> 02:55:41,050
only son being saved by a girl.

1989
02:55:41,050 --> 02:55:53,260
Don't do it, little Khan, whispers the voice
behind his forehead, don't let it happen.

1990
02:55:53,260 --> 02:55:56,930
Timucin ignores the voice.

1991
02:55:56,930 --> 02:56:02,880
He opens his eyes and sits bolt upright in
his saddle; his fingers grip the bridle so

1992
02:56:02,880 --> 02:56:05,890
hard that it hurts.

1993
02:56:05,890 --> 02:56:08,010
"We ride."

1994
02:56:08,010 --> 02:56:13,729
CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Khan

1995
02:56:13,729 --> 02:56:17,950
It has grown very quiet in the great yurt.

1996
02:56:17,950 --> 02:56:24,640
The air is stuffy from all the people and
the fire, and Timucin does not know whether

1997
02:56:24,640 --> 02:56:30,520
it is his head or his throat that hurts more.

1998
02:56:30,520 --> 02:56:35,380
Something invisible seems to be in the tent,
too.

1999
02:56:35,380 --> 02:56:43,539
It is something without a body, something
that crackles and hovers between them.

2000
02:56:43,539 --> 02:56:51,409
It turns the silence between their words into
something acrimonious and makes the small

2001
02:56:51,409 --> 02:56:57,770
hairs on the back of the men's hands and necks
stand on end.

2002
02:56:57,770 --> 02:57:07,260
Timucin closes his eyes and refuses to understand
the excited words directed at him by one of

2003
02:57:07,260 --> 02:57:08,449
the men.

2004
02:57:08,449 --> 02:57:12,260
Ilhan's father, who else?

2005
02:57:12,260 --> 02:57:16,800
He is tired like he has never been tired before.

2006
02:57:16,800 --> 02:57:24,850
It is as if he is carrying an invisible heavy
burden on his shoulders, and his shoulders

2007
02:57:24,850 --> 02:57:31,830
no longer feel as broad and strong as he thought
they had become just a few hours back.

2008
02:57:31,830 --> 02:57:39,080
His mouth is dry from speaking for too long
and too loudly.

2009
02:57:39,080 --> 02:57:47,239
His thoughts have been replaced by a chaotic
emptiness behind his forehead that not even

2010
02:57:47,239 --> 02:57:50,479
Sarantuya's words can escape.

2011
02:57:50,479 --> 02:57:57,140
Her whispering is different, almost unpleasant.

2012
02:57:57,140 --> 02:58:03,369
Without realizing that he is doing it, his
hand is feeling around for something to hold

2013
02:58:03,369 --> 02:58:05,010
onto.

2014
02:58:05,010 --> 02:58:06,890
He feels lost.

2015
02:58:06,890 --> 02:58:18,670
A thinner, cooler hand that is somehow filled
with wonderful warmth takes his and holds

2016
02:58:18,670 --> 02:58:20,710
it.

2017
02:58:20,710 --> 02:58:26,949
As he opens his eyes, he is looking at Arbesa's
beautiful face.

2018
02:58:26,949 --> 02:58:34,130
It looks very serious, yet in the depth of
her eyes, those eyes into which he likes to

2019
02:58:34,130 --> 02:58:42,149
dive, he can see a look of sorrow and endless
empathy.

2020
02:58:42,149 --> 02:58:48,739
It is not necessary for Arbesa to say anything
to him, or even to smile at him.

2021
02:58:48,739 --> 02:58:56,159
He can just feel the strength that she is
trying to give him, and is very thankful for

2022
02:58:56,159 --> 02:58:57,680
it.

2023
02:58:57,680 --> 02:59:03,510
"We must decide now, Khan!"

2024
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:11,869
Timucin turns to Ilhan's father with a tired
movement and only notices as he is doing so

2025
02:59:11,869 --> 02:59:19,149
that Ilhan's father is not saying these words
for the first time, and that he has said them

2026
02:59:19,149 --> 02:59:23,489
louder and more strongly each time.

2027
02:59:23,489 --> 02:59:32,330
He also notices that the confusion of shouts,
words and nervous movements is slowly dying

2028
02:59:32,330 --> 02:59:34,199
down.

2029
02:59:34,199 --> 02:59:41,420
He becomes uncomfortably aware that at least
a dozen pairs of eyes are staring at him and

2030
02:59:41,420 --> 02:59:45,510
listening to every word he says.

2031
02:59:45,510 --> 02:59:52,930
The two dogs, who have been sitting still
as two statues hewn of black basalt at his

2032
02:59:52,930 --> 02:59:58,970
sides, listening and looking alertly, have
begun to whimper.

2033
02:59:58,970 --> 03:00:06,100
He gestures with his left hand and they return
to silence.

2034
03:00:06,100 --> 03:00:13,489
Two or three of the men who have perhaps come
too close retire respectfully, their eyes

2035
03:00:13,489 --> 03:00:17,489
filled with fear.

2036
03:00:17,489 --> 03:00:20,279
He does not want this.

2037
03:00:20,279 --> 03:00:26,640
He has returned from the happiest time of
his life to date to celebrate the happiest

2038
03:00:26,640 --> 03:00:36,189
day, not to hold a war council, and certainly
not to get involved in this useless and dangerous

2039
03:00:36,189 --> 03:00:38,670
struggle for power.

2040
03:00:38,670 --> 03:00:45,489
Yet it is precisely this, which he must do,
he realizes sadly.

2041
03:00:45,489 --> 03:00:52,539
Ilhan's father has never been a friend of
his father's, and does not like Timucin either.

2042
03:00:52,539 --> 03:01:00,380
In fact, Timucin has always seen Ilhan's father
as one of those who is most likely to challenge

2043
03:01:00,380 --> 03:01:03,620
his father for his position as khan.

2044
03:01:03,620 --> 03:01:11,640
Do not let him provoke you, little Khan, whispers
a voice in his thoughts.

2045
03:01:11,640 --> 03:01:18,720
Sarantuya has not said much since he entered
the camp and began this council, which has

2046
03:01:18,720 --> 03:01:26,249
now been going on all day and will certainly
continue into the night, but Timucin has felt

2047
03:01:26,249 --> 03:01:29,140
her presence the whole time.

2048
03:01:29,140 --> 03:01:35,920
She has listened attentively to every word
that has been said - especially to the words,

2049
03:01:35,920 --> 03:01:39,069
he has said.

2050
03:01:39,069 --> 03:01:47,590
It is as if he is afraid of what is to come,
he is worried about what will happen.

2051
03:01:47,590 --> 03:01:52,649
He does not know what it is, but it frightens
him.

2052
03:01:52,649 --> 03:01:58,789
I know, he thinks silently.

2053
03:01:58,789 --> 03:02:05,499
Arbesa looks at him briefly, a look that no
one else notices, but which lets him know

2054
03:02:05,499 --> 03:02:12,649
that his conversation with himself in his
head has not escaped her notice.

2055
03:02:12,649 --> 03:02:14,930
Perhaps she has been listening.

2056
03:02:14,930 --> 03:02:21,420
More probably, she too has been speaking with
her own dragon.

2057
03:02:21,420 --> 03:02:24,380
He speaks, loudly.

2058
03:02:24,380 --> 03:02:29,540
"We must all of us keep a cool head.

2059
03:02:29,540 --> 03:02:37,100
If we react too hastily, we may further endanger
Tamer's life, rather than save it."

2060
03:02:37,100 --> 03:02:45,479
The tall, thin warrior pulls a scornful face
and grunts, which would have been enough to

2061
03:02:45,479 --> 03:02:51,499
cost him his head if Tamer were in Timucin's
place.

2062
03:02:51,499 --> 03:02:58,939
And in a way, it is as if he is in Timucin's
place, despite the hours he has spent now

2063
03:02:58,939 --> 03:03:06,069
being told by many of the warriors that he
is the de facto khan, that this is de facto

2064
03:03:06,069 --> 03:03:13,700
his yurt, that these are his warriors who
have sworn loyalty to the khan, even if he

2065
03:03:13,700 --> 03:03:16,250
does not want to be it.

2066
03:03:16,250 --> 03:03:19,600
It is a grotesque situation.

2067
03:03:19,600 --> 03:03:28,449
Yes, it is true that he has returned in order
to move into this yurt, one day, to take his

2068
03:03:28,449 --> 03:03:35,529
father's carved throne, one day, to become
khan - one day.

2069
03:03:35,529 --> 03:03:37,670
But not now.

2070
03:03:37,670 --> 03:03:41,140
And not like this.

2071
03:03:41,140 --> 03:03:48,710
The tense silence holds and, despite the fact
that they have now had the same conversation

2072
03:03:48,710 --> 03:03:55,430
perhaps a dozen times, Timucin starts to feel
a change.

2073
03:03:55,430 --> 03:04:03,100
The day is drawing to its close, and everyone
here is exhausted.

2074
03:04:03,100 --> 03:04:08,760
More than this, the men are ready to hear
a decision.

2075
03:04:08,760 --> 03:04:15,970
He asks himself how many of them would openly
rally to an opponent, should one come forward

2076
03:04:15,970 --> 03:04:19,320
to dispute his decision.

2077
03:04:19,320 --> 03:04:29,020
Not many, whispers Sarantuya behind his forehead,
because most of them are loyal to you.

2078
03:04:29,020 --> 03:04:35,119
But you must make the right decision nonetheless.

2079
03:04:35,119 --> 03:04:37,949
That has never happened before.

2080
03:04:37,949 --> 03:04:46,020
Timucin cannot remember Sarantuya ever having
given him such a direct piece of advice before,

2081
03:04:46,020 --> 03:04:51,050
let alone telling him, what other people are
thinking.

2082
03:04:51,050 --> 03:04:54,640
She must be very worried.

2083
03:04:54,640 --> 03:04:56,789
He is too.

2084
03:04:56,789 --> 03:05:02,689
If he could only know, which decision is the
right one.

2085
03:05:02,689 --> 03:05:06,840
Yet it will become clear in just a few moments.

2086
03:05:06,840 --> 03:05:09,659
"Timucin, you..."

2087
03:05:09,659 --> 03:05:16,270
Ilhan's father stops himself mid-flow as he
realizes that he has chosen the wrong tone

2088
03:05:16,270 --> 03:05:25,640
of voice and that several of the men are looking
at him darkly, almost threateningly.

2089
03:05:25,640 --> 03:05:32,770
He strokes his chin with the back of his hand
nervously and then continues, in a changed

2090
03:05:32,770 --> 03:05:38,030
tone, more respectful and yet non the less
defiant.

2091
03:05:38,030 --> 03:05:45,439
"My Khan, I do not wish to seem disrespectful,
but do let me speak openly."

2092
03:05:45,439 --> 03:05:50,510
"Go ahead," says Timucin.

2093
03:05:50,510 --> 03:05:58,130
Ilhan's father remains silent for far longer
than everyone expects; Ti mucin can see that

2094
03:05:58,130 --> 03:06:02,510
he is considering every word carefully.

2095
03:06:02,510 --> 03:06:07,959
"I do not wish to offend you, Khan..."

2096
03:06:07,959 --> 03:06:13,949
"Timucin," interrupts Timucin, "you are welcome
to keep calling me Timucin."

2097
03:06:13,949 --> 03:06:17,569
Is this the wrong decision?

2098
03:06:17,569 --> 03:06:23,100
A flicker of triumph surges into the man's
eyes.

2099
03:06:23,100 --> 03:06:32,300
"Timucin," nods the warrior, "you know your
father better than anyone here, so I do not

2100
03:06:32,300 --> 03:06:37,689
need to tell you how he would have reacted
if you had been taken and he were standing

2101
03:06:37,689 --> 03:06:39,539
here."

2102
03:06:39,539 --> 03:06:49,229
Timucin tries not to, but he can see his father's
face again, the sorrow and contempt as he

2103
03:06:49,229 --> 03:06:52,529
sees his son being beaten on the riverbank.

2104
03:06:52,529 --> 03:06:59,120
"Well, how would he have reacted?" asks Arbesa.

2105
03:06:59,120 --> 03:07:05,930
The rage that surges into the eyes of the
warrior cannot escape notice, yet Timucin

2106
03:07:05,930 --> 03:07:12,630
is not able to say if this is due to what
Arbesa has said, or just due to the fact that

2107
03:07:12,630 --> 03:07:15,430
she has dared to enter the fray.

2108
03:07:15,430 --> 03:07:22,040
Apart from her, there are only men in the
yurt, and women are not allowed in the war

2109
03:07:22,040 --> 03:07:23,060
council.

2110
03:07:23,060 --> 03:07:30,249
Yet Arbesa followed him into the tent as if
it were the most natural thing in the world,

2111
03:07:30,249 --> 03:07:36,800
and he only now realizes that this must have
felt like a slap in the face to many men like

2112
03:07:36,800 --> 03:07:39,289
Ilhan's father.

2113
03:07:39,289 --> 03:07:42,859
Yet it is too late to do anything about this
now.

2114
03:07:42,859 --> 03:07:45,510
"Be quiet, child!"

2115
03:07:45,510 --> 03:07:47,320
hisses the warrior.

2116
03:07:47,320 --> 03:07:50,800
"When men are talking, women are..."

2117
03:07:50,800 --> 03:07:59,010
"Arbesa," interrupts Timucin, not loudly but
sharply, "is my bride and will soon be your

2118
03:07:59,010 --> 03:08:00,010
ruler.

2119
03:08:00,010 --> 03:08:04,120
You shall speak to her in a more respectful
tone!"

2120
03:08:04,120 --> 03:08:09,649
The dogs growl in agreement and bare their
teeth.

2121
03:08:09,649 --> 03:08:14,390
Timucin does not hold them back this time.

2122
03:08:14,390 --> 03:08:22,069
The man stares at him, the smouldering rage
in his eyes burning brighter, and Timucin

2123
03:08:22,069 --> 03:08:27,930
sees that it is probably nothing more than
the presence of his huge fighting dogs that

2124
03:08:27,930 --> 03:08:32,399
is keeping Ilhan's father from acting on his
impulses.

2125
03:08:32,399 --> 03:08:41,649
What if, thinks Timucin angrily, I were to
just let them loose and watch them do their

2126
03:08:41,649 --> 03:08:47,760
job, which is to protect me and to tear my
enemies to shreds?

2127
03:08:47,760 --> 03:08:55,239
At this moment, however, Chuzir stands on
the other side next to Arbesa and lets his

2128
03:08:55,239 --> 03:09:03,420
hand fall loudly onto the handle of his sword,
hanging in his belt.

2129
03:09:03,420 --> 03:09:12,340
It is just a gesture, nothing more, yet it
suffices to fill Timucin's heart with warmth

2130
03:09:12,340 --> 03:09:14,820
and strength.

2131
03:09:14,820 --> 03:09:24,419
"Our khan," answers Ilhan's father in a deliberate
and carefully respectful tone, "would have

2132
03:09:24,419 --> 03:09:29,130
done what any true khan would do.

2133
03:09:29,130 --> 03:09:35,449
He would have called his men to arms and let
these cowards have the answer they deserve."

2134
03:09:35,449 --> 03:09:42,170
"And what would be this answer?" asks Timucin.

2135
03:09:42,170 --> 03:09:47,340
"We must go and free our khan!"

2136
03:09:47,340 --> 03:09:54,459
"Yet did you not yourself just call Timucin
'khan'?" asks Arbesa.

2137
03:09:54,459 --> 03:10:01,209
Timucin does not say anything, but he sighs
inside.

2138
03:10:01,209 --> 03:10:05,060
She may be right, but she is walking on thin
ice.

2139
03:10:05,060 --> 03:10:10,499
"Who is your new khan, the man to whom you
owe allegiance..."

2140
03:10:10,499 --> 03:10:17,669
"As long as Timucin's father is not here,
yes," answers the warrior, "and I shall obey

2141
03:10:17,669 --> 03:10:18,669
him."

2142
03:10:18,669 --> 03:10:21,619
He then turns to Timucin.

2143
03:10:21,619 --> 03:10:27,249
"We are talking about the life of your father
here, my Khan.

2144
03:10:27,249 --> 03:10:29,939
And the honour of our tribe.

2145
03:10:29,939 --> 03:10:36,060
Tamer will not be happy if he returns to find
that we have behaved as cowards."

2146
03:10:36,060 --> 03:10:42,329
The men in the yurt murmur in agreement, and
Timucin can almost feel the change in what

2147
03:10:42,329 --> 03:10:45,390
they now expect him to decide.

2148
03:10:45,390 --> 03:10:53,659
Whether he is a boy or not, Timucin has just
been insulted by Ilhan's father, and he cannot

2149
03:10:53,659 --> 03:10:55,229
accept that.

2150
03:10:55,229 --> 03:11:03,319
"It is no sign of cowardice to avoid a fight
that one cannot win," he says, quoting his

2151
03:11:03,319 --> 03:11:04,319
father.

2152
03:11:04,319 --> 03:11:10,590
"The Tatars are great in number and they will
know that we are coming."

2153
03:11:10,590 --> 03:11:18,000
He raises his hand to stop Ilhan's father
contradicting him, and continues in a deliberately

2154
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:19,239
commanding tone.

2155
03:11:19,239 --> 03:11:27,899
"We all know how weak the Tatars are - they
are no match for us and we could win against

2156
03:11:27,899 --> 03:11:28,899
them.

2157
03:11:28,899 --> 03:11:31,350
Yet they would kill my father.

2158
03:11:31,350 --> 03:11:35,020
Is that what you want?"

2159
03:11:35,020 --> 03:11:42,169
Two or three of the men make frightened noises,
and Timucin's opponent drops his hand to his

2160
03:11:42,169 --> 03:11:46,199
sword, and then relaxes it.

2161
03:11:46,199 --> 03:11:51,530
He speaks respectfully despite the fury inside
him.

2162
03:11:51,530 --> 03:11:58,640
"No, of course not, my Khan," he whispers.

2163
03:11:58,640 --> 03:12:01,459
"So what do you wish to do?"

2164
03:12:01,459 --> 03:12:09,209
"I have decided," answers Timucin loudly and
in a clear voice so that everyone may hear

2165
03:12:09,209 --> 03:12:15,989
him, "that we shall wait until the messenger
returns whom you sent to the Tatars.

2166
03:12:15,989 --> 03:12:19,669
We shall hear their conditions.

2167
03:12:19,669 --> 03:12:24,949
Should they demand a ransom, then we shall
pay it if we are able."

2168
03:12:24,949 --> 03:12:29,649
"And if we are not?" asks the warrior.

2169
03:12:29,649 --> 03:12:38,979
"Then I shall go to them myself and negotiate
his release personally," replies Timucin.

2170
03:12:38,979 --> 03:12:46,479
Not only Ilhan's father, but also Chuzir and
many other warriors look at him, astonished

2171
03:12:46,479 --> 03:12:54,079
and almost incredulous; only the warmth in
Arbesa's eyes seems to grow.

2172
03:12:54,079 --> 03:13:01,960
"Should I not return," he answers after a
short, pregnant pause, "then you will have

2173
03:13:01,960 --> 03:13:04,050
to decide what to do."

2174
03:13:04,050 --> 03:13:11,010
"My Khan," shouts one of the men, his voice
sounding more disbelieving than angry, "that

2175
03:13:11,010 --> 03:13:12,810
will not help your father!"

2176
03:13:12,810 --> 03:13:15,340
"This is the coward's way!"

2177
03:13:15,340 --> 03:13:16,539
adds another.

2178
03:13:16,539 --> 03:13:22,470
"We are warriors, not wenches who can be traded
like pawns!"

2179
03:13:22,470 --> 03:13:27,430
There is a brief moment when it looks as if
the mood may turn.

2180
03:13:27,430 --> 03:13:35,169
Timucin can almost feel people rallying to
Ilhan's father, and he can almost see his

2181
03:13:35,169 --> 03:13:39,489
father's disapproving look.

2182
03:13:39,489 --> 03:13:46,939
His father has not only seen his son beaten,
but now how he is losing his tribe.

2183
03:13:46,939 --> 03:13:51,430
This has never happened for as long as there
have been khans.

2184
03:13:51,430 --> 03:13:56,149
"Silence!" he shouts.

2185
03:13:56,149 --> 03:14:05,470
Is he tricking himself, or can he hear the
roar of huge, invisible wings throwing their

2186
03:14:05,470 --> 03:14:07,600
shadow over the men?

2187
03:14:07,600 --> 03:14:13,669
"I know what you are thinking; I too feel
it.

2188
03:14:13,669 --> 03:14:21,380
Yet there is no honour in spilling innocent
blood when there is another path to take.

2189
03:14:21,380 --> 03:14:27,260
I am no more a coward than any of you, and
if there is no other choice, of course we

2190
03:14:27,260 --> 03:14:30,830
shall take our weapons and free Tamer.

2191
03:14:30,830 --> 03:14:37,229
Yet we shall try the way of the word, before
we take that of the sword.

2192
03:14:37,229 --> 03:14:44,920
I have decided so, and you shall obey me!"

2193
03:14:44,920 --> 03:14:54,359
The invisible wings spread further; something
is stirring in him, the power of the dragon

2194
03:14:54,359 --> 03:14:56,699
that is part of him.

2195
03:14:56,699 --> 03:15:02,380
It is the legacy of his father, which he now
understands for the first time not to be the

2196
03:15:02,380 --> 03:15:09,010
strength in his sword-arm nor the accuracy
of his bow, but something different and far

2197
03:15:09,010 --> 03:15:10,539
more important.

2198
03:15:10,539 --> 03:15:17,669
Once again, there is an unpleasant silence.

2199
03:15:17,669 --> 03:15:26,289
Everyone stares at him, most of them disbelieving,
astonished or angry, a few of them perhaps

2200
03:15:26,289 --> 03:15:27,750
in agreement.

2201
03:15:27,750 --> 03:15:37,020
Then Ilhan's father speaks quietly, disdainfully,
and looking at Arbesa out of the corner of

2202
03:15:37,020 --> 03:15:38,789
his eyes.

2203
03:15:38,789 --> 03:15:45,229
"Now we are ruled by women and children."

2204
03:15:45,229 --> 03:15:48,869
Timucin slaps him in the face.

2205
03:15:48,869 --> 03:15:51,350
It is absurd.

2206
03:15:51,350 --> 03:15:58,999
The warrior is more than a head taller than
him and ten times as strong, and a part of

2207
03:15:58,999 --> 03:16:05,380
him knows that this is just the moment his
opponent has been waiting for.

2208
03:16:05,380 --> 03:16:12,020
Several men suck their teeth and others lower
their hands to their swords and daggers.

2209
03:16:12,020 --> 03:16:18,199
Ilhan's father takes a step back and begins
to draw his sword.

2210
03:16:18,199 --> 03:16:26,590
Suddenly, a big black form growls, leaps and
sinks its teeth into his arm.

2211
03:16:26,590 --> 03:16:33,250
The man screams, roaring as he falls back,
and tries to use his other arm to hit the

2212
03:16:33,250 --> 03:16:39,279
dog, but it is no use, as the second dog has
taken his other hand.

2213
03:16:39,279 --> 03:16:49,029
Deep in Timucin, the dragon stirs, stretches
its claws and, for a moment, Timucin is sure

2214
03:16:49,029 --> 03:16:51,640
that the warrior can see her.

2215
03:16:51,640 --> 03:16:58,919
He is sure that he can see into her eyes and
can see something that shakes him to the depth

2216
03:16:58,919 --> 03:17:06,930
of his soul and fills his heart with fear,
a fear so dark that it makes him forget the

2217
03:17:06,930 --> 03:17:11,319
black beasts biting at his arms.

2218
03:17:11,319 --> 03:17:20,850
Time seems to become slower as Timucin sees
in fantastic clarity how one of the dogs lets

2219
03:17:20,850 --> 03:17:26,460
his arm drop and goes for his neck.

2220
03:17:26,460 --> 03:17:37,979
He wants the dog to bite; for a moment, for
a short terrible moment, he wants it to bite,

2221
03:17:37,979 --> 03:17:45,350
wants nothing more than to see his fighting
dogs tear this man to pieces, this man who

2222
03:17:45,350 --> 03:17:52,600
has dared to challenge him, the khan, the
ruler of this tribe; this man who has dared

2223
03:17:52,600 --> 03:17:56,350
to insult him and his bride.

2224
03:17:56,350 --> 03:18:02,609
He can see his father again, the expression
in his eyes as he watched his son's most shameful

2225
03:18:02,609 --> 03:18:10,499
moment, and perhaps this is what he owes his
father, what his father expects of him.

2226
03:18:10,499 --> 03:18:16,600
Perhaps he should spill the blood of his enemy,
let the entire tribe see his life be taken,

2227
03:18:16,600 --> 03:18:20,770
see that the rule of the stronger is still
law.

2228
03:18:20,770 --> 03:18:29,239
It is in him, this power that is almost the
power of a dragon, an ancient power that seeks

2229
03:18:29,239 --> 03:18:34,720
blood and triumph and knows no mercy.

2230
03:18:34,720 --> 03:18:42,350
This is what Sarantuya means when she has
talked about the paths he can take.

2231
03:18:42,350 --> 03:18:51,039
He does not even have to do anything: he must
only wait one more heartbeat and the fangs

2232
03:18:51,039 --> 03:18:57,649
of his dogs will do it for him - he will be
khan.

2233
03:18:57,649 --> 03:19:01,280
"No!" he shouts.

2234
03:19:01,280 --> 03:19:03,439
"Heel!"

2235
03:19:03,439 --> 03:19:11,710
The dog's teeth close on the man with a noise
that sounds like a bear- trap snapping shut.

2236
03:19:11,710 --> 03:19:20,640
Yet it is not his throat that the dog bites,
but a patch of skin just under it.

2237
03:19:20,640 --> 03:19:27,189
The second dog lets go of the man's bleeding
arm and returns to Timucin.

2238
03:19:27,189 --> 03:19:36,270
"No," says Timucin, now more quietly, almost
to himself.

2239
03:19:36,270 --> 03:19:41,350
"No, that is not our path."

2240
03:19:41,350 --> 03:19:47,810
Once again, it is as if time has slowed.

2241
03:19:47,810 --> 03:19:52,170
Countless eyes are staring at him.

2242
03:19:52,170 --> 03:19:58,580
Many of the men are astounded, shocked, completely
helpless.

2243
03:19:58,580 --> 03:20:05,789
Each one is waiting for him to draw his sword
and finish it himself.

2244
03:20:05,789 --> 03:20:13,919
Instead, Timucin does something that surprises
himself more than anyone else.

2245
03:20:13,919 --> 03:20:23,600
He stops the tempting, dark whispering inside
himself, drops his hand from his sword, and

2246
03:20:23,600 --> 03:20:28,180
goes to the man to help him up.

2247
03:20:28,180 --> 03:20:38,659
Ilhan's father looks at him, confused and
scared, yet he takes his hand and stands up,

2248
03:20:38,659 --> 03:20:41,550
swaying on his feet.

2249
03:20:41,550 --> 03:20:49,359
His eyes no longer burn with triumph and fury,
but are a sea of uncertainty.

2250
03:20:49,359 --> 03:20:58,380
He stands there for a moment, looking down
at Timucin, before picking up his sword.

2251
03:20:58,380 --> 03:21:03,700
He returns it to his sheath, tired.

2252
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:09,010
He sinks his head and speaks with real respect.

2253
03:21:09,010 --> 03:21:17,080
"Yes, my Khan, I shall obey you."

2254
03:21:17,080 --> 03:21:26,250
And one day, you will understand me, too,
adds Timucin in his thoughts.

2255
03:21:26,250 --> 03:21:33,220
He tries to smile at the man in his eyes,
but the warrior avoids his gaze; he seems

2256
03:21:33,220 --> 03:21:36,569
shocked.

2257
03:21:36,569 --> 03:21:43,949
Perhaps he understands before Timucin that
it is this moment that has made the boy into

2258
03:21:43,949 --> 03:21:49,369
the khan, whether his father returns or not.

2259
03:21:49,369 --> 03:21:56,220
"You may go now!" he says to everyone loudly
after a pause.

2260
03:21:56,220 --> 03:22:00,729
"Keep watch for the messenger and tell me
the instant he arrives.

2261
03:22:00,729 --> 03:22:08,520
It has been a long day and we all need peace
and rest."

2262
03:22:08,520 --> 03:22:16,650
The sound of huge beating wings and sharp
claws accompanies his every word, but he can

2263
03:22:16,650 --> 03:22:22,979
feel the tension dropping at the same time.

2264
03:22:22,979 --> 03:22:27,069
One after another, the men turn and go.

2265
03:22:27,069 --> 03:22:32,459
Finally, Ilhan's father is almost alone with
them.

2266
03:22:32,459 --> 03:22:42,180
He looks at Timucin, then at Arbesa, then
again at Timucin and goes, leaving the couple

2267
03:22:42,180 --> 03:22:44,760
to themselves.

2268
03:22:44,760 --> 03:22:50,300
The dogs are at Timucin's side.

2269
03:22:50,300 --> 03:22:53,229
Only Chuzir is left.

2270
03:22:53,229 --> 03:22:56,640
He looks at Timucin in a way that makes him
shiver.

2271
03:22:56,640 --> 03:23:00,560
"Thank you," says Timucin.

2272
03:23:00,560 --> 03:23:05,000
"What for," asks Chuzir.

2273
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:11,760
The sound of his voice frightens Timucin even
more than the look in his eyes.

2274
03:23:11,760 --> 03:23:15,310
"For being on my side," he answers.

2275
03:23:15,310 --> 03:23:19,789
"I do not know what would have happened without
you."

2276
03:23:19,789 --> 03:23:25,569
"You are my brother in oath," replies Chuzir.

2277
03:23:25,569 --> 03:23:32,380
This is not the answer that Timucin wants
to hear, but he also feels how pointless it

2278
03:23:32,380 --> 03:23:35,819
would be to say another word.

2279
03:23:35,819 --> 03:23:44,439
He nods silently, and Chuzir understands that
he now wishes to be alone with Arbesa.

2280
03:23:44,439 --> 03:23:51,460
He turns away obediently, but stops after
a few paces and turns to them.

2281
03:23:51,460 --> 03:23:53,870
"Was he right?"

2282
03:23:53,870 --> 03:23:55,850
"About what?"

2283
03:23:55,850 --> 03:24:03,040
"That you have been too long with the other
tribe," says Chuzir.

2284
03:24:03,040 --> 03:24:09,039
These words hurt Timucin deeply, but he does
not show it.

2285
03:24:09,039 --> 03:24:17,859
Instead, he shakes his head and smiles as
if Chuzir has said something silly, but forgivable.

2286
03:24:17,859 --> 03:24:20,970
"No," he replies.

2287
03:24:20,970 --> 03:24:23,390
Nothing more.

2288
03:24:23,390 --> 03:24:28,489
Chuzir seems even more disappointed, but turns
and leaves.

2289
03:24:28,489 --> 03:24:35,149
"That was incredibly brave of you," says Arbesa.

2290
03:24:35,149 --> 03:24:36,810
"Was it?

2291
03:24:36,810 --> 03:24:40,610
Or is he right?"

2292
03:24:40,610 --> 03:24:43,760
Arbesa lays her hand softly on his shoulder.

2293
03:24:43,760 --> 03:24:48,319
"One day, he will understand you.

2294
03:24:48,319 --> 03:24:53,419
He is your brother in oath and, more importantly,
he is your friend.

2295
03:24:53,419 --> 03:24:55,899
Give him time."

2296
03:24:55,899 --> 03:25:04,489
Timucin is almost ashamed and is just able
to stop himself from pushing away her hand.

2297
03:25:04,489 --> 03:25:13,920
"I hope I am wrong, but I feel like I have
destroyed what makes my people special."

2298
03:25:13,920 --> 03:25:17,699
Arbesa laughs strangely at this.

2299
03:25:17,699 --> 03:25:23,830
"You have only destroyed what makes them bad.

2300
03:25:23,830 --> 03:25:25,680
They will understand you.

2301
03:25:25,680 --> 03:25:34,229
You will become a great khan, who rules not
by the sword, but by wisdom."

2302
03:25:34,229 --> 03:25:38,439
Yet is this really wisdom?

2303
03:25:38,439 --> 03:25:45,909
Timucin takes a few steps back from her and
Arbesa lets her hand drop.

2304
03:25:45,909 --> 03:25:51,290
She is disappointed, yet her eyes still smile
at him.

2305
03:25:51,290 --> 03:25:56,289
"You need time, too," she says.

2306
03:25:56,289 --> 03:26:04,300
"Your people are known for their peaceful
nature," he answers, "which I admire and envy,

2307
03:26:04,300 --> 03:26:09,630
but my people are not like this, not like
yours."

2308
03:26:09,630 --> 03:26:19,890
"Yet we too were once like you," replies Arbesa,
"until the dragons showed us the right way.

2309
03:26:19,890 --> 03:26:25,999
Have you never asked yourselves how we were
able to live in peace with our neighbours?

2310
03:26:25,999 --> 03:26:32,820
Why your father and mine are friends, despite
the fact that Tamer has attacked so many other

2311
03:26:32,820 --> 03:26:38,229
tribes and robbed them of their women, their
animals and their treasure?"

2312
03:26:38,229 --> 03:26:41,069
As he tries to answer, she talks further.

2313
03:26:41,069 --> 03:26:47,459
"I know what you want to say: there is no
honour in attacking a tribe of cowards," she

2314
03:26:47,459 --> 03:26:54,270
says, quoting him in scornful tone, "but we
are no more cowards than you.

2315
03:26:54,270 --> 03:27:01,919
That is what you have felt, Timucin; it is
the power of the dragons that protects us.

2316
03:27:01,919 --> 03:27:08,909
You have just learned something very important,
my love, and I am happy for you."

2317
03:27:08,909 --> 03:27:13,180
"What have I learned?" asks Timucin.

2318
03:27:13,180 --> 03:27:23,430
Arbesa does not answer, but the silent voice
of Sarantuya answers him for her.

2319
03:27:23,430 --> 03:27:32,609
If you had done what the men wanted and drawn
your sword, you would have lost me.

2320
03:27:32,609 --> 03:27:39,770
Yet you won the fight for me, not I, answers
Timucin silently.

2321
03:27:39,770 --> 03:27:47,260
He did not just imagine the dragon's powerful
force in his heart; he really has her power,

2322
03:27:47,260 --> 03:27:53,520
her invincibility, just as much as anyone
else here, including Ilhan's father.

2323
03:27:53,520 --> 03:27:59,479
Sarantuya bent the will of the men, not him.

2324
03:27:59,479 --> 03:28:04,340
That is not true, answers the dragon.

2325
03:28:04,340 --> 03:28:12,529
Her voice sounds as if she is slightly amused,
but it is warm and proud, too.

2326
03:28:12,529 --> 03:28:17,810
It was your power that they felt.

2327
03:28:17,810 --> 03:28:20,350
You have always had it.

2328
03:28:20,350 --> 03:28:26,549
I only showed you how you can best use it,
and I am proud of you, my Khan.
