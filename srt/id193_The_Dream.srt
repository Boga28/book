1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,600
Even if dreams can show us the future,  

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,240
this dream did not make sense. Must 
I never pass a lorry on a clear road?

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,240
Can a dream show us the future and give us 
the opportunity of changing it? It is hard  

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:27,920
to believe. If we can see the future in a dream, 
then surely the future already exists. If it does,  

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,800
then we are not free to act in the ways we wish 
to, we are not responsible for our own lives.

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,600
Before I tell you the dream, I must explain a 
little about the context. It was the summer of  

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,800
four years ago, and I was driving my family 
back from Italy through the south of France.  

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,160
My son had not yet learned to drive, my daughter 
was too young, and my wife doesn't drive at all.  

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:04,480
I had been at the wheel for the best part of three 
weeks. Perhaps I was tired; perhaps I could think  

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,880
of nothing except cars. We spent the night of 
the dream in a town called Tain l'Hermitage.

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,440
Now I'll tell you the dream. I was sitting 
in a big, powerful, cream-coloured car,  

12
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,320
and I was driving at high 
speed through the country.  

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,240
I was coming to a bend in the road, and in 
front of me, there was a very large lorry.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,880
My foot reached out towards the brake, 
but it could not find it. I looked down:  

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:50,160
there was no brake! Worse: my hands held empty 
air. There was no wheel for them to hold.  

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,760
There were no controls of any kind. Already 
we were almost into the back of the lorry.

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,680
I shouted in fear. Then I heard a calm voice 
coming from my left, and I turned my head.  

18
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,000
A stranger was sitting there. He 
was a cheerful man of about forty.  

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,280
He was wearing an expensive shirt, and 
on his head, he had a red hat. I couldn't  

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,440
understand what he said; he spoke very quickly 
in French, and my own French is not very good.  

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,800
I didn't, in fact, care what he said. 
My eyes were on his clean, fat hands,  

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:43,200
which were holding the wheel. This car had its 
wheel on the left. He, not I, was in control.

23
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,440
We drove safely round the bend. He turned the 
wheel slightly to place the car in the middle  

24
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:59,120
of the road. He was going to pass the lorry. The 
road stretched straight ahead. It was bright in  

25
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,560
the sunlight and it was quite empty. Only one 
other person was in sight; a woman was sitting  

26
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,320
outside a small house with white walls, and this 
house was almost exactly ahead of us. She was  

27
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:21,120
sitting by a table putting some flowers in pots. 
She wanted to sell us some, and waved them at us.

28
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,360
This sight, for some reason, 
filled me with a terrible fear.  

29
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,040
The flowers made me think of 
death and our final resting place.

30
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,240
At this moment, we were level with the lorry and 
ready to pass it, but then the lorry began to  

31
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,800
turn away from the side of the road, towards our 
car. It appeared that the driver was doing this  

32
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,880
on purpose. The stranger by my side shouted 
loudly and tried to move out of the way.  

33
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,560
There was a terrible noise from the back of the 
car, and then an explosion. The earth seemed to  

34
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:10,720
turn over, and the noise of flames burned in 
my ears. At that point, I woke up in fear.

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,480
I was very worried by this 
dream, and could not sleep again.  

36
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,920
It seemed to have a message, 
and I wanted to explain it.

37
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,280
Even if dreams can show us the 
future, this dream did not make sense.  

38
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,360
Must I never pass a lorry on a clear road?  

39
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,000
The road to Paris is always filled with very large 
lorries. Most of them come up from Marseilles,  

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,680
and I always have to pass them when the road is 
clear; I can't drive slowly behind them forever.  

41
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,840
No, this was not the meaning of the 
dream. At its heart was some kind of fear.  

42
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,480
I had to recognize my fear, and 
then I could forget all about it.

43
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,440
I thought about my driving 
during the last three weeks.  

44
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I tried to remember all the lorries 
and all the small white houses.  

45
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,960
I thought of all the cars, which were painted 
cream. I remembered nothing of any great interest.  

46
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,360
I had imagined that the road in the dream 
must be in France; it was long, empty and  

47
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:35,680
straight. But then I remembered that we had passed 
the lorry on the right. So the dream was about a  

48
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,920
road in England; in England all cars keep to 
the left. Immediately, I remembered something.

49
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Two years before this, I was travelling in the 
north of England. An American and I were making  

50
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,800
some radio programmes. He had brought his car from 
America, and of course, the driver sat on the left  

51
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,080
side. The brakes and other controls were also on 
the left, but the colour of his car was not cream.

52
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,400
The American was a careless driver, and 
often passed other cars against my advice.  

53
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,600
Remember that I was in a better position to see:  

54
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,640
I was sitting on the right. Once, just 
after Nottingham, he played chicken'.

55
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,920
You probably know about 'chicken'; it 
is a game that is played on the roads.  

56
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,040
It is becoming more and more popular in 
America, because long journeys are often  

57
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,880
very dull. You just move your car into 
the middle of the road and stay there.

58
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,000
When another car appears, it comes 
towards you in the middle of the road.  

59
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:51,360
The driver who turns away is the chicken. 
Quite often, neither driver turns away.

60
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,880
I expressed my displeasure at this game in 
language that the American could not fail  

61
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:05,440
to understand. We did not play it again, but it 
had probably left its mark on my mind. So then,  

62
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,640
when I was asleep, I experienced it all again in 
a dream. I also remembered something else while I  

63
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:20,560
was having breakfast. When we played 'chicken', 
it was an uncommonly windy day. We stopped at  

64
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,600
Chesterfield, and the American bought a hat. It 
was a black hat, not a red one, but in dreams,  

65
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,080
details are not always exact. After this, I 
forgot about the dream until the afternoon.

66
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,720
The big French lorries often play their own game.  

67
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,640
They stay in the middle of the road, and you can't 
pass them. You have to stay behind them. Sometimes  

68
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,480
you have to follow them for endless kilometres, 
although the roads are almost completely empty.

69
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,120
This afternoon we were following a large 
vehicle, which was making terrible noises.  

70
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,600
When I blew my horn, the driver 
moved to the side of the road,  

71
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,560
but it was the wrong side. He was driving 
along on the left, instead of keeping to  

72
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,000
the right. There was enough space on the 
right for me to pass him. But to do that  

73
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,120
would be wrong. So I just followed him for a few 
kilometres and I told myself not to pass him.

74
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,760
I considered the situation from every 
point of view. I could certainly turn my  

75
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,280
car more quickly than he could turn his 
lorry. It was a very big, heavy lorry.  

76
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,200
Could I, perhaps, pass him quickly on the right 
before he could do anything? If he turned to the  

77
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:51,840
right, though, he could easily kill us all. He 
probably wanted a bit of fun, but he might want  

78
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:59,040
an accident. If he killed us, nobody would say 
it was his fault; the law would be on his side.

79
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,200
The road ahead was quite empty, 
and went on for many kilometres.  

80
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:15,120
I drove more slowly until some distance separated 
us. Then I increased my speed as much as I could.  

81
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,320
I drove towards that empty space beside the lorry. 
My car was moving at about 110 kilometres an hour.

82
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,080
The front of my car was almost 
level with the back of the lorry.  

83
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,840
Then I saw something that knocked the 
breath out of my body. On the grass  

84
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:44,800
beside the road, a woman was sitting outside 
a small white house with a table of flowers!

85
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,920
For the first time in my life, I changed my mind 
while I was preparing to pass another vehicle.  

86
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,000
My foot went down hard on the brake. 
The car rocked from side to side.  

87
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,840
From behind me, I heard the sound of a horn.  

88
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:10,560
Another car was following us at a high speed. I 
knew its colour before I saw it; it was cream.

89
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,520
I pressed hard on the brake 
and turned the wheel slightly.  

90
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:21,520
I was just able to move in behind the lorry 
without touching it. The other car passed us  

91
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:29,200
and the driver blew his horn wildly. It reached 
the lorry - and then the lorry turned towards it.

92
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,720
For a moment I thought that the car was going 
to pass the lorry safely; it was moving very  

93
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,760
fast. Then the front of the lorry just touched 
the back of the car. It was only a light touch,  

94
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,960
but it knocked the car towards the side 
of the road and the woman at the table.

95
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,280
The driver of that car knew exactly what to do. 
With the greatest skill, he turned it back into  

96
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,760
the middle of the road. His control was wonderful, 
much better than mine. He waved angrily at the  

97
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,760
lorry driver and drove quickly away in a 
cloud of dust. He was soon out of sight.

98
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,520
We stayed that night in Fontainebleau. A 
big car was standing outside the hotel,  

99
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,600
and the back showed signs of damage 
to the paintwork. It was a cream car,  

100
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,240
and so I looked for the driver. He was not 
wearing a red hat or an expensive shirt.

101
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,520
He was a young man from Paris - 
not like the driver in my dream.  

102
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,080
He spoke good English, so I asked him if 
he would like the number of that lorry.  

103
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:49,280
I had noticed it, and I was happy to give it 
to him. But he only laughed; the law won't  

104
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,840
help you if you pass on the wrong side of the 
road. To him the whole thing had been a game.

105
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,840
'It tests your skill,' he said. 'If the 
car is powerful enough, you can do it.  

106
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,600
But you couldn't do it, not in your car.'

107
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,000
I didn't tell him about my dream, 
my reason for not passing the lorry.  

108
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,680
There was no time; he was in a hurry 
and wanted to reach Paris quickly.  

109
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,400
It made me think, though. I don't 
really believe in dreams, of course;  

110
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:37,040
but something saved us all 
from a terrible death.
 
 
 
 

111
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,581
- THE END -
