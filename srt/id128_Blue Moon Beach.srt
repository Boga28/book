CHAPTER ONE
Summer Days

2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,560
I'm sitting and watching birds.

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,910
I'm at Blue Moon Beach.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,300
I think it is the best beach in the world.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,630
The water is warm and blue.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,230
The sand is very white.

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,949
Blue Moon Beach is my beach.

8
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:33,540
I've lived here all my life.

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,480
Other people come here for a week or two.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,040
They swim at the beach.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,970
They come to see the fish too.

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:45,820
There are many fish in the water at Blue Moon
Beach.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,100
My name is Samuel Martin.

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,990
At home I am called 'Sammy'.

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,460
At school I am 'Sam'.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,210
I like the name Sam.

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,280
I think I'm too old to be Sammy now.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,620
I am fifteen.

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,759
I live with my mother and father in our hotel
- Blue Moon Hotel.

20
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,000
When I was little I loved all the rooms and
the stairs.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,369
I loved the big kitchen and all the food.

22
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,619
I liked the people who came to stay.

23
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:24,969
I played with lots of children who came with
their families.

24
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:31,719
What I like now are the animals and birds
that live near our hotel.

25
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,319
I like the sea eagles best.

26
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,329
I want to write a book about them one day.

27
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:41,270
They are big, strong birds.

28
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,009
Sea eagles are the kings of all the birds.

29
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:50,299
They fly over the water to look for food.

30
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,219
When I was little there were lots of sea eagles
at Blue Moon Beach.

31
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:58,399
This year there are only two sea eagles.

32
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,399
Why?

33
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,009
Because there are not many trees now.

34
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:05,680
Sea eagles need trees.

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,810
Now there are lots of houses.

36
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,509
It makes me angry.

37
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:14,879
I don't want the birds to leave Blue Moon
Beach.

38
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,650
Today is the first day of summer - no school
for five weeks!

39
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,319
Five weeks to swim and watch the sea eagles.

40
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,989
I'm lying on the sand.

41
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:30,420
I'm watching one sea eagle.

42
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,750
It is on the rocks at the end of the beach.

43
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,260
I haven't seen the other sea eagle today.

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,950
Two men are walking along the beach.

45
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,959
I don't think they are here to swim.

46
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,650
They are wearing dark clothes.

47
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,750
They are wearing shoes and socks.

48
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,030
People never wear shoes and socks at Blue
Moon Beach.

49
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,200
The men stop near me.

50
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,569
They look at the rocks.

51
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,940
They must be looking at the sea eagle.

52
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,219
They talk quietly.

53
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,430
Who are they?

54
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,790
They see me looking at them and then they
walk away.

55
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,489
I go for a swim.

56
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:15,159
I love swimming.

57
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,690
There are a lot of people in the water today
but not many of them swim out in the deep

58
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,690
water.

59
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,040
I swim out a long way.

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,280
There are a lot of fish swimming below me.

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,920
I lie in the water and look up.

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,630
I see the sea eagle flying above me.

63
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,250
I love being out in the water at Blue Moon
Beach.

64
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,480
The sun is high in the sky.

65
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,170
It's time for lunch and I'm hungry.

66
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,549
I swim back to the beach and then I walk back
to the hotel.

67
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,000
'Sammy,' Mum calls from her office.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,500
It is at the front of the hotel.

69
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
'Yes, Mum?'

70
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,459
I say.

71
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,249
'Dad needs your help in the kitchen after
lunch,' she says.

72
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:05,260
'Today?

73
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,609
But it's the first day of summer, Mum.

74
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:11,219
I want to go swimming again this afternoon.

75
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:12,329
And the birds...'

76
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,250
'I want to go swimming too,' says Mum.

77
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,239
'But we all have to work.

78
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,729
We have a lot of visitors.'

79
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:22,600
She looks tired.

80
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,090
She works very hard.

81
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,470
'Okay, Mum.'

82
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,350
Mum smiles at me.

83
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,210
'Thank you, Sammy,' she says.

84
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,100
'Sam, Mum, not Sammy.

85
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,940
I'm not a little boy now.

86
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,220
I'm fifteen.'

87
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,220
'Okay...

88
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
Sam.

89
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Go and eat lunch.

90
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,000
Then help your father.'

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,050
I go into the kitchen.

92
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,400
Dad is cooking.

93
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,050
I think he is the best cook in the world.

94
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,720
He uses lots of pots.

95
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,610
I'll have to wash them after lunch.

96
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,190
'Hello, Sammy,' says Dad.

97
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,190
'It's time for lunch.

98
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,130
Are you hungry?'

99
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,360
'Yes!

100
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,810
And it smells very good.'

101
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,220
After lunch I help my father.

102
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,720
We clean the kitchen.

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,780
I wash the pots and Dad washes the floor.

104
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,030
I like to work with Dad.

105
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,720
Some boys don't see their fathers very often.

106
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,030
But Dad and I are good friends.

107
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,470
'How are your birds today, Sammy?'

108
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,470
Dad asks.

109
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,640
'The mother is there.

110
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,560
I want to see if there are eggs in the nest.

111
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,480
Sea eagles always have two eggs.'

112
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,750
'Eggs?'

113
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,289
Dad says.

114
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:40,550
'It's a long time since I've seen a baby sea
eagle.'

115
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,460
'Yes,' I say.

116
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,770
We have nearly finished cleaning the kitchen.

117
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,960
'Can I go now, Dad?'

118
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,370
I ask.

119
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,280
'Okay, Sammy.'

120
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,710
'Dad - my name is Sam, not Sammy.'

121
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,270
I often say this to Mum and Dad.

122
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,460
They forget.

123
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,220
'Okay, Sam.

124
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,240
Go on - look at your beautiful birds.'

125
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,170
'Thank you, Dad.'

126
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,150
I walk through the hotel.

127
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,020
I open the front door quietly but Mum hears
me.

128
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,120
'Sammy?

129
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,250
Come here, please,' she calls from the office.

130
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,130
Shall I run?

131
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,660
It is a beautiful, warm day.

132
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,780
I don't want to do any more work today.

133
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,810
I run.

134
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,620
Mum comes out of the office.

135
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,650
'Stop, Sammy!'

136
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,050
she calls.

137
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,050
I stop.

138
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,680
I walk back to the office.

139
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,020
'Dad and I have nearly finished cleaning the
kitchen, Mum,' I say.

140
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,789
'I need to talk to you now,' Mum says.

141
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:50,430
'But Mum, I want to see the sea eagles.'

142
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,230
'Sam,' says Mum.

143
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,870
'Please.'

144
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,050
So I sit and listen.

145
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,260
'A boy is coming here today with his mother.

146
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,440
His name is Tim Bailey.

147
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,780
I want you to show him the village.

148
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,120
Take him to the beach.'

149
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,009
'But Mum, I want to watch the sea eagles.

150
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:15,069
The mother has been in the nest all day.

151
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:18,419
They'll have baby sea eagles in the nest soon.'

152
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:21,979
'Sam, please listen.

153
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:26,460
Tim's mother, Mary, was my best friend at
school.

154
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,180
They live in the city now.

155
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,590
Tim's father died after being sick for a long
time.

156
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,270
Mary is very sad.

157
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,379
Tim is sad too.

158
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,670
I asked them to come here.

159
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,479
The sea air will be good for them.

160
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,690
Tim needs a friend.

161
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,419
I told his mother you will be Tim's friend.'

162
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,340
Mum looks at me.

163
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,490
I look at the floor.

164
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,229
I don't want to be friends with Tim.

165
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,909
I don't want Mum telling me who to be friends
with.

166
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:02,220
I want to swim and watch the sea eagles.

167
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,020
'Mum - do I have to?'

168
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,300
'Yes, you do.'

169
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:16,229
'All right, Mum,' I say.

170
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:28,000
CHAPTER TWO
Tim Can't Swim

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,740
'This is my son, Sammy,' says Mum to Tim and
his mother.

172
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,169
'Hello, Sammy,' says Tim's mother.

173
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,810
Tim doesn't speak.

174
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,930
Tim is tall and thin.

175
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,740
He has black hair and he is very white.

176
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,730
Maybe he never goes out in the sun.

177
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,920
His clothes are new.

178
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,120
My clothes are old.

179
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,560
There are holes in my T-shirt.

180
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,959
Mum wants to buy me new T-shirts.

181
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,790
But I like my old clothes.

182
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,620
I look at Tim and he looks at me.

183
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,779
We don't smile.

184
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:12,750
'You boys can go and play now,' says my mother.

185
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,240
'Mum!'

186
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,390
I say quietly.

187
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,820
'I don't play.

188
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,570
I'm fifteen.'

189
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,570
'Take Tim to the beach, Sammy,' says Mum.

190
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,900
'Come on, Tim,' I say.

191
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,090
'Wear a hat, Tim,' says his mother.

192
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,690
'And wear your T-shirt all the time.

193
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,540
Stay in the shallow water.

194
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,410
Be back in an hour.'

195
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,890
Tim says, 'Mum, stop it.'

196
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,650
He looks at me and says, 'Come on.'

197
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,450
He doesn't wait for me.

198
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,300
He walks away.

199
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,769
His mother calls, 'Tim, you forgot your hat!'

200
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:56,080
I take the hat from her and I follow Tim to
the beach.

201
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,300
I stand on the sand and look for Tim.

202
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,200
For a minute I can't see him.

203
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,839
But then I see him at the other end of the
beach.

204
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
I walk along the beach and give him his hat.

205
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,290
'You don't have to stay with me,' Tim says.

206
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,589
'You don't want to, do you?

207
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:17,720
Our mothers are friends.

208
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,220
We're not friends.'

209
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,390
What can I say?

210
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,250
'Just go away,' Tim says.

211
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,220
He sits on the sand and looks out to sea.

212
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,170
'Okay, I will,' I say.

213
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,990
I go to the rocks.

214
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,320
I sit quietly and watch the mother sea eagle.

215
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,209
She has not left the nest all day.

216
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,940
I watched the eagles making the nest.

217
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,709
It took a long time.

218
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,670
They worked hard.

219
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,709
They flew away and returned with sticks again
and again.

220
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:55,800
They brought back lots of leaves too.

221
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,010
Now one sea eagle is always sitting in the
nest.

222
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,470
I look down at the beach.

223
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,300
I can't see Tim.

224
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,209
Maybe he went back to the hotel.

225
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,040
The men are on the beach again.

226
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,279
The bigger man is talking into a mobile phone.

227
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,720
The other one is looking out to sea and up
into the sky.

228
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,430
What is he looking for?

229
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,980
The men are walking towards me.

230
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,310
The bigger man puts his mobile phone away.

231
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,210
He looks at me then talks to the other man.

232
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,410
They both look at me then walk away.

233
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,209
Who are they?

234
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:44,950
I see the second sea eagle flying over the
beach.

235
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,490
He flies over the sand, then over the water.

236
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,459
He flies in circles, looking for food.

237
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,110
Suddenly he drops down into the water.

238
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,070
He flies up again, carrying a large fish.

239
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,760
He will take the fish to the nest.

240
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,810
The mother sea eagle must be very hungry.

241
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:12,459
Just as the bird flies near me, a boy climbs
up the rocks next to the nest.

242
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:14,889
It is Tim.

243
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:16,949
It is hard to climb those rocks.

244
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:22,240
They are big and there aren't many places
to put your hands and feet.

245
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,410
Tim doesn't see me.

246
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,610
He walks towards the sea eagles' nest.

247
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,490
Oh, no!

248
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,360
Both the sea eagles are flying away.

249
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,430
Tim has scared them.

250
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,440
When people go near a nest, the birds fly
off.

251
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,399
And the eggs - the eggs will get cold!

252
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,490
'Get away!'

253
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,420
I scream at Tim.

254
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,090
I jump up and run towards him.

255
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,780
I'm very angry.

256
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,780
I want to hit him.

257
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,720
Tim sees me.

258
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,699
Now he looks scared.

259
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,760
The sea eagles are flying in circles above
us.

260
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,829
'Get away,' I scream again.

261
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:05,170
Tim doesn't want to come near me.

262
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,750
He tries to climb down the rocks to get away
from me.

263
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,270
He's going very fast.

264
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,240
Suddenly he falls off the rocks.

265
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,290
I hear him hit the water.

266
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,660
He'll be okay, I think.

267
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,850
I'll wait for him to swim back to the beach.

268
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,500
City boys should stay in the city.

269
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,130
I start walking back to the beach.

270
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,240
Then I hear Tim screaming from the water,
'Help!

271
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,290
Help!

272
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,440
I can't swim.'

273
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:44,580
Suddenly I'm very scared.

274
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:52,371
CHAPTER THREE
Out at Night

275
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:54,160
'Help!'

276
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,790
calls Tim again.

277
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,259
I run over the rocks and jump into the deep
water.

278
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:03,510
There are no other people near us.

279
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,950
I swim out to Tim.

280
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,160
We are both very scared.

281
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,529
'It's okay,' I say to him.

282
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:13,110
'I'll help you.

283
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,670
Hold onto me.'

284
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,730
Tim holds onto me.

285
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,420
We both go under the water.

286
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,010
Then I swim and I pull Tim up.

287
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,550
We both get our heads above the water.

288
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,079
'Lie back in the water, Tim,' I say.

289
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,579
'I can't.'

290
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,829
'Yes, you can.

291
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:34,269
Just try.

292
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:36,970
I'll hold you,' I say.

293
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,870
I hold onto his arm.

294
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,300
He lies back in the water.

295
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,470
I start swimming.

296
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,310
I have to swim for a long time.

297
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,890
I talk to Tim as I swim.

298
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,360
'It's okay, Tim.

299
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,420
We're nearly there.'

300
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:57,779
When we get to the shallow water, Tim and
I just sit in the water.

301
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,360
Then we get out and we both lie down on the
warm sand.

302
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,959
I am very tired.

303
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,490
'Thanks,' says Tim.

304
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,389
'I was very scared.'

305
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:12,970
'I was too,' I say.

306
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:18,470
'Why did you scream at me on the rocks?' asks
Tim.

307
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,410
'Because you were near the sea eagles' nest,'
I say.

308
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,170
'They are scared of us.'

309
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,490
'Oh,' says Tim.

310
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,380
'I don't know much about birds.'

311
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,920
'Look - there.

312
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,010
Do you see them?

313
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,459
Both the sea eagles are flying over the water.

314
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:40,940
One of them needs to go back to the nest to
sit on the eggs.

315
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,259
I'm worried about the eggs.

316
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,440
They must stay warm.'

317
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,610
'I'm sorry,' says Tim.

318
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,480
He watches the sea eagles.

319
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,910
'They are beautiful.'

320
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,720
'I think so too,' I say.

321
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,199
I look at my watch.

322
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,459
'Come on.

323
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,339
We must hurry.

324
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:02,600
We're late.'

325
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,360
We walk quickly back to the hotel.

326
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,410
I'm worried.

327
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,060
What will Tim say to his mother?

328
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,920
My mother will be very angry if she knows
what I did.

329
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,459
Tim's mother comes running from the hotel.

330
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,590
'Tim, where have you been?

331
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,780
You're late!

332
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,170
And you're all wet!

333
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,390
You didn't go in the water, did you?

334
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,329
Oh, Tim!'

335
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:29,450
She is very angry with him.

336
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,610
Tim looks at me.

337
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,519
Then he looks at his mother.

338
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,980
'Sorry, Mum,' he says.

339
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,889
'I tried to swim.

340
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:40,440
I couldn't do it.

341
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,279
The water was very deep.

342
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,149
Sam saved me.'

343
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:47,800
'Tim - how could you?'

344
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,430
His mother is going to cry.

345
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,490
'I won't do it again, Mum.

346
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,660
Sorry.'

347
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,839
She looks at me.

348
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,330
'Thank you so much, Sammy.

349
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,070
You are a good friend.

350
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,050
Thank you for saving Tim.'

351
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,290
I don't know what to say.

352
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,470
My mother comes out of the hotel.

353
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,710
Tim's mother calls to her, 'Sammy saved Tim.

354
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,730
Tim can't swim.

355
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,230
Your son is a hero!'

356
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,290
I don't think I'm a hero.

357
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,660
I feel bad.

358
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,170
Tim didn't try to swim.

359
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,090
I screamed at him and he fell into the water.

360
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,970
We both know it.

361
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,570
I look at Tim and he looks at me.

362
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,020
He smiles and I smile back.

363
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,640
'My hero!' says Mum.

364
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,100
'Come in and put on some dry clothes, both
of you.

365
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,060
Then I'll make you some hot chocolate.'

366
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,850
I love hot chocolate.

367
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,120
Mum makes the best hot chocolate in the world.

368
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,470
I drink it very slowly.

369
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,710
Tim does too.

370
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,470
We're sitting in the kitchen.

371
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,550
Mum is back in her office.

372
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,550
Dad comes in.

373
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,460
'I hear my son is a hero,' he says.

374
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,800
'Well done, Sammy.'

375
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,140
'Thanks, Dad - but...'

376
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,300
I feel bad.

377
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,700
Everyone thinks I'm a hero.

378
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:20,580
'Sam swims very well, Mr Martin,' says Tim
quickly.

379
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,220
'And he's going to help me learn about sea
eagles.'

380
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,140
'You and your sea eagles, Sammy,' says Dad.

381
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,670
He smiles at Tim.

382
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,110
'Sammy is always talking about those birds.'

383
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,780
'Do you want some hot chocolate, Dad?'

384
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,780
I ask him.

385
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,920
'There is some in the pot.'

386
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,000
'No thanks, Sammy.

387
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,290
I think I'll have some coffee.'

388
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,310
'Good,' I say.

389
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,470
'More hot chocolate for you and me, Tim!'

390
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,760
'Yes, please,' says Tim.

391
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,030
'I'd love some more.'

392
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,200
After dinner, Tim and I sit outside.

393
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,650
It is a warm night but it is very dark.

394
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,680
There is no moon.

395
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,180
Our mothers are sitting inside, talking and
talking.

396
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,860
Dad is in the kitchen, cooking.

397
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,940
He cooks all the meals for the people who
stay at Blue Moon Hotel.

398
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,830
He loves cooking but it is a big job.

399
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,770
'It's good to be out here,' says Tim.

400
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,550
'It's quiet.

401
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,930
My mother talks and talks.

402
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:31,120
She asked you a lot of questions about this
afternoon.

403
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,530
I'm sorry about that.

404
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,270
But she worries about me.'

405
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,030
'That's okay,' I say.

406
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,740
'After Dad died...'

407
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:47,770
Tim stops, then he says, 'It's just Mum and
me now.

408
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,700
She only has me.'

409
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,960
What can I say?

410
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,760
I don't speak for a minute.

411
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,660
Then I say, 'I'm worried about the sea eagles.

412
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,560
They need to keep the eggs warm all the time.

413
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,400
I want to know one of them is back on the
nest.

414
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,230
I'm going to have a look.

415
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,070
I like to go for a walk at night.

416
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:13,760
If you're quiet, you see a lot of birds and
animals who come out at night.

417
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,860
Do you want to come with me?'

418
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,370
'Now?' asks Tim.

419
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,310
'Yes,' I say.

420
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,220
'No, thanks.

421
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,000
Mum says I can't go out at night.'

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,690
I think for a minute.

423
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,230
'When does she go to bed?'

424
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,870
I ask.

425
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,030
'Early.

426
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,280
She always goes to bed early.'

427
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,300
'Okay.

428
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,270
We'll go out after your mother goes to bed.'

429
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,080
Tim thinks for a minute.

430
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,160
'Okay.

431
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,330
I'll come.

432
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,280
Mum won't know.'

433
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:53,040
Later, Tim and I walk very quietly down the
stairs and out of the hotel.

434
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,250
My parents are watching television.

435
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,310
Tim's mother is in her room.

436
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,480
We walk down to the beach.

437
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,420
We go along a road towards the rocks.

438
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,880
It is very dark.

439
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,780
'People never come here at night,' I say to
Tim.

440
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,160
'Don't they?' he says.

441
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,870
'Then what is that truck doing there?'

442
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,570
'What truck?'

443
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,740
I ask.

444
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,860
'Look - over there.'

445
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,680
There is a truck.

446
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,820
It isn't easy to see.

447
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,570
It is under some trees.

448
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,520
Tim and I walk over to the truck.

449
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,890
The back doors of the truck are open so we
look inside.

450
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,980
There are a lot of boxes, bags, nets and ropes
in the truck.

451
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,450
'Oh, no,' I say.

452
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,310
'What's wrong?'

453
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,560
Tim asks me.

454
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,460
'We must be careful, Tim,' I say quietly.

455
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,660
'I think bird smugglers use these things.'

456
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,980
'How do you know that?' asks Tim.

457
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,030
'I saw something about it on television.

458
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,420
Look - there are air holes in the boxes.'

459
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,210
'Why are there bird smugglers here?'

460
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,390
asks Tim.

461
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,470
'The sea eagles!'

462
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,620
I say.

463
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,670
'Bird smugglers take sea eagles and other
birds.

464
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:21,120
Then they sell the birds for a lot of money
in other countries.

465
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,560
They put these nets and ropes near birds'
nests.

466
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,730
Then they scare the birds.

467
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,850
The birds fly into the nets.

468
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:34,280
The bird smugglers take the birds out of the
nets and put them in these boxes.'

469
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,780
I open one of the bags.

470
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,120
It has some bird food in it.

471
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,340
Another bag has some fish in it.

472
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,170
Sea eagles love fish.

473
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,500
'You're right, Sam,' says Tim.

474
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,460
'What do we do now?'

475
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:55,370
'We need to stop the bird smugglers,' I say
to Tim.

476
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:01,890
'And quickly.'

477
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:10,060
CHAPTER FOUR
Where is Tim?

478
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,770
'We must get help,' says Tim.

479
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,590
'I'll stay here and watch the truck.

480
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,050
You go and get help.'

481
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,230
'Okay.

482
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,470
I'll go and get Constable Carter.

483
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,500
He's the police officer here in Blue Moon
Beach.

484
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,350
But first I want to see what the smugglers
are doing.

485
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,290
I'm going to have a quick look.

486
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,910
I want to tell Constable Carter all about
them.

487
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,400
He'll need to know how many there are and
what they are doing.

488
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,760
I want to see if the sea eagles are okay too.'

489
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,330
'Okay, but be very careful, Sam,' says Tim.

490
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,030
'And be quick!'

491
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,120
'I'll be careful.

492
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,220
You be careful too, Tim.

493
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,750
Be very quiet and listen for the smugglers.

494
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,550
Stay here under this tree.

495
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,260
They must not see you.

496
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,130
Stay away from the truck,' I say.

497
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,610
'Okay,' says Tim.

498
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,390
I run through the trees.

499
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,390
I know the way to the nest very well.

500
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,050
I'm really worried about the sea eagles - and
their eggs.

501
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,970
I try to be quiet.

502
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,540
I'm scared the smugglers will see me or hear
me.

503
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,790
I know I am near the nest.

504
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,470
Suddenly, I hear some people coming.

505
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,870
Then I see two men.

506
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,480
They are the men I saw on the beach this morning.

507
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,920
'Come on, come on,' one says.

508
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,300
'We're late.

509
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,960
We mustn't stay here too long.

510
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,440
The boat is waiting for us at Sunshine Bay.'

511
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,100
'Okay, okay,' says the other man.

512
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
'Ow!

513
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,110
It bit me!'

514
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,660
The men have the sea eagles.

515
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,300
They are the smugglers!

516
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,080
I am angry.

517
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,700
I want to scream at them.

518
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,800
But most of all, I want to get the birds back.

519
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,510
So I am quiet and I don't move.

520
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,490
I can see that the men have knives.

521
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,400
I don't want the birds to get hurt.

522
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,930
And the men are both bigger and stronger than
me.

523
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,780
What can I do to stop them?

524
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,090
It's best to leave this to the police, I think.

525
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,160
Constable Carter will know what to do.

526
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,440
I move quietly behind a tree.

527
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,220
'What's that?' says the smaller man.

528
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,210
He looks towards me.

529
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,350
It is very dark.

530
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,380
Can he see me?

531
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,500
I am really scared.

532
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,260
I close my eyes.

533
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,270
'What's what?' says the other one.

534
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,450
'Over there.

535
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,640
I saw...'

536
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,410
'Come on, Mac.

537
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,600
It's dark.

538
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,560
You can't see a thing.

539
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,140
Stop worrying.

540
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,440
We're nearly at the truck.'

541
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,510
The truck - Tim!

542
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,120
The men walk on.

543
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,730
They are carrying the birds.

544
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,500
The birds are making a lot of noise.

545
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,950
Has Tim heard the men and the birds?

546
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,360
I follow the men quietly.

547
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,460
I hear some noise, then I hear the truck start.

548
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,000
I run.

549
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,980
The truck isn't there any more.

550
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,140
'Tim?

551
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,300
Tim!'

552
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,620
I call.

553
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,790
'Tim!'

554
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,270
Where is Tim?

555
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,280
Did the smugglers see him?

556
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:45,990
Is Tim in the truck with the birds?

557
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,400
Is he hurt?

558
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,060
'Tim!

559
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,720
Tim!'

560
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,700
There's no answer.

561
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,440
CHAPTER FIVE
Finding the Truck

562
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,380
I must get help.

563
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,390
I start running.

564
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,130
The hotel is closer than Constable Carter's
house.

565
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,270
Dad will know what to do.

566
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,530
Dad will help.

567
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,500
But Mum and Dad will be very angry with me.

568
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,300
It was wrong to take Tim out at night.

569
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,540
It was wrong to look for the birds after we
saw the truck.

570
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,420
Worst of all, it was wrong to leave Tim with
the truck.

571
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,710
His mother will be very worried and very angry.

572
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,550
No, I won't go to the hotel.

573
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,830
I'll run to Constable Carter's house.

574
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,820
Blue Moon village isn't very big.

575
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,920
I know where he lives.

576
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,490
His house is next to my school.

577
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,400
It is only two kilometres from the beach.

578
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,210
What can one police officer do to stop the
smugglers?

579
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,500
I heard where the smugglers are going - Sunshine
Bay.

580
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,400
I can tell Constable Carter.

581
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,750
Perhaps he'll phone the police officer there.

582
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,080
And that police officer can stop the smugglers.

583
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,310
It's very dark but I know the roads well.

584
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,800
I run and run.

585
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,670
Will Constable Carter be at home?

586
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:22,260
The police officer in Sunshine Bay must stop
the truck.

587
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,690
I'm very worried about Tim and the birds.

588
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,010
Is Tim okay?

589
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,160
I try not to cry.

590
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,620
It is late at night.

591
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,090
There are no cars on the road.

592
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,730
There are no houses here.

593
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,030
Then I see it - the truck!

594
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,960
It's stopped on the side of the road.

595
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,110
I stop running.

596
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:48,830
The two smugglers are standing beside the
truck.

597
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,570
The bigger one is very angry.

598
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,160
He hits the truck.

599
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,070
'You drive this truck every day.

600
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,120
You must know what's wrong with it.

601
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Why won't it go?

602
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,050
We must get out of here.'

603
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,750
The second man just stands there.

604
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,530
He looks very unhappy.

605
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:12,050
I need to open the back doors of the truck.

606
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,630
I need to see if Tim is in there.

607
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,440
I need to get the sea eagles out.

608
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,040
I walk very quietly and very slowly to the
truck.

609
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,880
The men are at the front of the truck now.

610
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,940
One of them is talking on his mobile phone.

611
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:35,040
He says, 'Yes, we're at Blue Moon Beach.

612
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,470
Yes, we have the birds.

613
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,920
But we can't drive the truck.'

614
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,490
He is quiet, then he says, 'It just stopped.

615
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,270
I don't know why.

616
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,320
We can't start it again.

617
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,040
What do we do now?'

618
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,850
He's quiet again.

619
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:59,650
Then he says, 'Okay, we'll wait for you to
call us back.

620
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,390
But don't be long.'

621
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,170
I am at the back door of the truck.

622
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,580
Very quietly I start to open the door.

623
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,520
I am very, very scared.

624
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,370
'Psst...

625
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,220
Sam!'

626
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,340
The voice comes from the dark trees beside
the truck.

627
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,290
I stare into the trees.

628
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:26,370
'It's me,' Tim calls quietly.

629
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,610
I walk very slowly over to the trees.

630
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,440
I see Tim.

631
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,660
He's under the biggest tree.

632
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,080
We talk very quietly.

633
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,140
'Are you okay, Tim?

634
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,980
Are you hurt?'

635
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,050
'I'm all right,' he says.

636
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,330
'I'm sorry, Tim,' I say to him.

637
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,700
He smiles at me.

638
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,700
'Why?'

639
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,790
'Because I left you with the truck.

640
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,050
Because I didn't go to the police officer's
house.

641
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,360
I went to look at the birds.'

642
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,720
'That's okay,' says Tim.

643
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,140
'I stopped the smugglers.

644
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,300
I stopped their truck.'

645
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,470
He smiles again.

646
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,780
'You stopped the truck?

647
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,780
How?'

648
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,770
I forget to be quiet and Tim puts his hand
over my mouth.

649
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,840
'Sh!

650
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,960
Be quiet and I'll tell you.

651
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,870
After you left me, I thought about what to
do.

652
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,980
I know a lot about trucks and cars.

653
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,540
My grandfather has a farm.

654
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,050
He works on his trucks and cars.

655
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,600
I help him.

656
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,300
I love it.

657
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,390
So I knew what to do with the smugglers' truck.

658
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:39,540
I got under it and I hit the fuel pipe with
a rock.'

659
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,200
'What's a fuel pipe?'

660
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,140
I ask quietly.

661
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,290
The men are sitting in the truck now.

662
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,180
They must be waiting for the mobile phone
to ring.

663
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,110
The windows are closed so they can't hear
us.

664
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:58,480
'You don't know much about cars and trucks,
do you?' says Tim with a smile.

665
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,860
'The fuel pipe takes petrol to the engine.

666
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,770
The engine needs petrol to go.'

667
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,610
'I know that!'

668
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,190
I say.

669
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,630
'Okay.

670
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:12,100
So I hit the fuel pipe again and again.

671
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,580
Now the petrol can't get through to the engine.'

672
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,420
'Well done!'

673
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,630
I say.

674
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:25,110
'Then those men came back with the birds and
they put the birds in the back of the truck.

675
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,270
I watched from behind a big rock,' says Tim.

676
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,220
'The men were careful with the birds, though.

677
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,780
They didn't hurt them.'

678
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,590
'What about the eggs?'

679
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,020
I ask.

680
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,690
'Did the smugglers take them too?

681
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,440
Are they in the truck?

682
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,520
They mustn't get cold.'

683
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,620
'I don't know where the eggs are,' says Tim.

684
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,980
'I didn't see them.'

685
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,710
'What happened next?'

686
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,020
I ask.

687
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,690
'Well, the men got into the truck and the
engine started.

688
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,940
I was worried.

689
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,720
I thought, 'There's petrol left in the engine
and the fuel pipe.'

690
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,710
I didn't know what to do, so I jumped into
the back of the truck.

691
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:10,560
The truck went for a while but then the engine
stopped.

692
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,310
So I jumped out... and here I am.'

693
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:18,910
I smile, but then Tim says, 'What do we do
now?'

694
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:22,070
'I don't know,' I say.

695
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,830
'I want to get the birds out of the truck,
but we can't.

696
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,810
They will make a lot of noise and the men
will hear.

697
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,700
Also the birds are very heavy.

698
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,360
We can't carry them far.'

699
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,310
'We need to go to the police officer's house,'
says Tim.

700
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,530
'But we can't leave.

701
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,870
The smugglers will see us.'

702
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,130
We both sit quietly for a while.

703
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,010
Then I know what to do.

704
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,150
'Tim!

705
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,660
We need to get some ropes and nets out of
the truck.

706
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,590
We must do it very quietly.'

707
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,670
Tim comes with me to the truck.

708
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,340
We open the back door very slowly.

709
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,750
I look in.

710
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,350
I can't see the sea eagles.

711
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,480
I do see some large boxes.

712
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,200
Perhaps the birds are in them.

713
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,380
I take some ropes out of the truck.

714
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:27,190
This must work!

715
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,500
CHAPTER SIX
The Men See Us

716
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,940
I'm standing at the back of the truck.

717
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,500
The bigger man gets out of the truck.

718
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,300
He is talking on his mobile phone again.

719
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,300
He is angry.

720
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,380
'No, we can't wait,' he says.

721
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,690
'You must come and get us now.'

722
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,639
Suddenly he sees me.

723
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,919
'I know who you are!'

724
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,040
I scream at him.

725
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,080
'You're a bird smuggler.

726
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,300
You have sea eagles in your truck.

727
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,859
I'm going to get the police!'

728
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:02,570
I start running away from the truck.

729
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,610
'Hey!'

730
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,980
He puts his mobile phone away.

731
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,040
'You!

732
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,090
Stop!'

733
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,060
He shouts to the other smuggler, 'Mac!

734
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,130
Come here, quickly.

735
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,700
I've found a boy.

736
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,510
He knows about the birds.'

737
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:19,010
I hear the truck door opening.

738
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,170
Mac shouts, 'Stop!'

739
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,170
too.

740
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,860
They both run after me.

741
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,880
I look back at them.

742
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,450
The bigger man is holding his knife!

743
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,480
I am very scared.

744
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,260
I jump over some ropes on the road.

745
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,630
'Now, Tim, now!'

746
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,210
I shout.

747
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,830
Tim is standing on the other side of the road.

748
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,880
He is holding onto the ropes.

749
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,550
He pulls them.

750
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,500
Suddenly there are nets and ropes in front
of the smugglers.

751
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,800
Both men run into the nets.

752
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,140
The bigger man drops his knife.

753
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,560
He puts his hands up to try to get out of
the nets.

754
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,810
Tim pulls the ropes.

755
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,810
I help him.

756
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,900
The men are shouting.

757
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,380
Tim and I are screaming.

758
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:08,310
We sit on the smugglers but the men are very
strong and very angry.

759
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,050
We can't hold them for very long.

760
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,630
Will they get out of the nets?

761
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,630
'Help!

762
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,630
Help!'

763
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,830
I shout.

764
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,130
'Get off me!'

765
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,270
shouts the bigger man.

766
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:23,040
A car drives up and stops.

767
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,750
'Is that you, Sam?'

768
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,100
It's the police officer, Constable Carter.

769
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,420
He is getting out of his car.

770
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,420
'Sam?

771
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,770
Are you okay?

772
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,720
I had a phone call from the people down the
road.

773
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,590
They said they heard a lot of people shouting.

774
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,720
Who are these men?'

775
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,940
'Oh, Constable Carter - it's so good to see
you.

776
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,020
These men are bird smugglers!

777
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,300
They put the sea eagles in the back of their
truck.'

778
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,560
The men try to get away from us.

779
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,760
But Constable Carter soon has them in the
back of the police car.

780
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,680
He calls on his radio for more police.

781
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,220
He sees the knife on the ground.

782
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,640
'Sam!

783
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,900
These men had knives!'

784
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,450
'I know.

785
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:15,390
Tim and I had to help the sea eagles, Constable
Carter,' I say quietly.

786
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,380
'Can we look in the truck now?

787
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,110
I need to know the birds are okay.'

788
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,770
I look into the boxes.

789
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,890
The birds are not hurt.

790
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,010
Best of all, the eggs are in one of the boxes.

791
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,490
Constable Carter looks at the birds and the
eggs.

792
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,680
'Well done, boys!'

793
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,690
'What will Mum say?' says Tim.

794
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:45,940
We both smile.

795
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:55,660
CHAPTER SEVEN
Friends

796
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,850
Tim and I help Constable Carter put the sea
eagles - and their eggs - back in the nest.

797
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,910
It's not easy.

798
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:07,060
The birds are very heavy and they don't like
us holding them.

799
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,350
One bird bites me.

800
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:12,980
The other police officers have taken the smugglers
away.

801
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:18,580
They are going to go to Sunshine Bay to look
for the smugglers' friends and their boat.

802
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:22,040
Tim and I go back to Blue Moon Hotel.

803
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,560
Constable Carter comes with us.

804
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,040
Dad and Mum are in bed.

805
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,530
They both come to the front door.

806
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:32,720
We all go into the front room.

807
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,080
Constable Carter tells them about the birds
and the smugglers.

808
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,500
I was right - my parents are very angry.

809
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:46,110
They are happy Tim and I are okay but they
are not happy with me.

810
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,140
Mum gets Tim's mother.

811
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,210
She walks in and sees Tim.

812
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:54,080
'Tim - why aren't you in bed?'

813
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,760
Tim doesn't speak.

814
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,160
He doesn't look at his mother.

815
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,810
My mother says, 'Constable Carter, this is
Mary Bailey, Tim's mother.'

816
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,430
Constable Carter says, 'Good evening, Mrs
Bailey.

817
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,830
I'm Steve Carter.

818
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,710
I'm the police officer here in Blue Moon Beach.

819
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:18,570
Your son Tim and his friend Sam are heroes.

820
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,150
They helped the police catch two bird smugglers.'

821
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:26,110
Tim's mother opens her eyes very wide.

822
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,470
'What?

823
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,960
Bird smugglers?

824
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,200
Tim, what's Constable Carter talking about?'

825
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:38,400
'Let's sit down and listen to the boys' story,'
says Dad.

826
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,330
Mum says, 'I'll make some hot chocolate.'

827
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,790
Soon, we're all drinking hot chocolate.

828
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:52,270
Constable Carter says, 'Sam, Tim, tell us
more of your story.

829
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:56,020
When did you know about the smugglers?'

830
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,290
I say, 'I saw those men on the beach this
morning.

831
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:04,070
They were looking at the sea eagles, and the
nest.

832
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:09,240
And tonight we saw the things in the back
of their truck - the boxes and the ropes and

833
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,850
the nets.

834
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,870
Then I knew.'

835
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:16,910
'Why didn't you go and get Constable Carter?'
asks Dad.

836
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:20,000
'Or come back home?' says Mum.

837
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,780
'That's a good question,' says Mrs Bailey.

838
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,040
'It is the job of the police to catch smugglers.

839
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,680
Tim, I'm very angry.

840
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,300
Why did you go out?

841
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,510
I told you not to go out at night.

842
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:38,350
Those men...' She starts to cry.

843
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:41,080
Mum goes to her and holds her hand.

844
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,340
'Now, Mary.

845
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,220
Don't cry,' says Mum.

846
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,080
'Tim is okay.

847
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,790
Boys will be boys.'

848
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:51,280
'No,' says Mrs Bailey.

849
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,630
'Not my Tim.

850
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,070
I need him.

851
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:58,150
It's just the two of us now.'

852
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,650
My family and Constable Carter do not speak.

853
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,350
Tim is quiet for a minute.

854
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:08,860
Then he looks at his mother and says, 'I'm
sorry, Mum.

855
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,570
But I'm fifteen.

856
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,740
I need to try new things.'

857
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,550
She looks at him.

858
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,280
She gives him a small smile.

859
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,160
'Oh, Tim.

860
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,520
Where has my little boy gone?

861
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,880
You're right.

862
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,160
But no more catching smugglers.

863
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
Okay?'

864
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,940
'Okay, Mum,' says Tim, with a big smile.

865
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:37,290
'I want to hear more about it,' says Dad.

866
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,260
'You were very clever to stop the truck.'

867
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,960
'Tim stopped the truck,' I say.

868
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,470
'And we caught them with their own nets!'
says Tim.

869
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:52,980
Tim and his mother stay with us for two weeks.

870
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,280
Tim and I tell our story again to Constable
Carter and some other police officers.

871
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,640
They did not catch the other bird smugglers
in the boat at Sunshine Bay.

872
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,770
But Tim and I are just happy the sea eagles
are okay.

873
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:10,370
I show Tim lots of things at Blue Moon Beach.

874
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:14,060
Soon he can name most of the birds and some
of the fish.

875
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:18,850
Every day we go to the beach and I teach him
to swim.

876
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,300
We go out deeper every day.

877
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:26,350
Some mornings, Mrs Bailey sits on the beach
and watches.

878
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:29,320
She smiles a lot more these days.

879
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,930
One day Tim says, 'Come in for a swim, Mum!'

880
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,000
And she does!

881
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Tim teaches me things too.

882
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,390
He teaches me about cars.

883
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:44,580
We climb under Dad's car and Tim shows me
the fuel pipe.

884
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:49,950
He shows me how he used the rock on the smugglers'
truck.

885
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,210
Tim and his mother are going home tomorrow.

886
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,340
I don't want them to go.

887
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,310
Tim wants to stay too.

888
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,620
Tim and I walk down to the beach and have
a swim.

889
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,020
Then we go out to the rocks.

890
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,760
Tim wants to have one last look at the sea
eagles.

891
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:13,660
Tim and I don't go near the nest these days,
but we see the birds flying above us.

892
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,730
One of the birds flies down to the nest.

893
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,940
Then we hear a noise coming from the nest.

894
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:25,730
It's a bird noise, but it's not like the noise
I've heard sea eagles make before.

895
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,240
'What's making that noise?' asks Tim.

896
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,730
'Let's go and see,' I say.

897
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,700
'Come on.'

898
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,300
We go a little closer to the nest, and what
do we see?

899
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,830
A baby sea eagle!

900
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:42,900
Only one.

901
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,500
Perhaps the other egg got cold.

902
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,140
But this baby sea eagle looks strong and well.

903
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:53,290
Its mother is giving it a small fish to eat.

904
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,090
Tim and I look up.

905
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,240
We watch the other sea eagle flying in circles
over Blue Moon Beach.

906
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:05,120
'In three months the baby will be flying too,'
I say.

907
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,470
'I'll come back and see that,' says my friend
Tim.

908
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:08,610
- THE END -
