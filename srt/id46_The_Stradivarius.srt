CHAPTER ONE
The Stradivarius

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:10,670
Thirty years ago there were many places like
Minx Mills in the southern United States.

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,279
People said there was no way to find them
except by accident.

4
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:24,980
But it was no accident that brought Jesse
McCord to Minx Mills.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,999
When Boone Elliot saw the car stop in front
of his house he did not move.

6
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:36,650
People always came to see him when their cars
needed to be fixed.

7
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:43,520
They knew that Boone Elliot could repair anything
with wheels on it.

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,250
A stranger got out of his car slowly.

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,910
"Are you Boone Elliot, the musician?"

10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:58,600
Boone was very pleased to be called a musician
instead of a car mechanic.

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,040
He nodded his head, "Yes."

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,189
The stranger smiled and closed his car door.

13
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:15,560
He had blond hair, small blue eyes and a narrow
face with a long chin.

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,630
He wore a thin moustache across his upper
lip.

15
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,770
Boone thought he must be about fifty years
old.

16
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,200
Boone walked over to him.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,880
The stranger shook Boone's hand.

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,479
"I'm Jesse McCord," he said.

19
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,979
"I have something I want to show you."

20
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,770
He opened his car door and pulled out a violin
case.

21
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,020
"Can we get out of the sun?" he asked.

22
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,580
Boone led the way to the porch.

23
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:58,319
Boone's wife Molly brought them ice tea in
tall glasses.

24
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,929
McCord drank his tea slowly.

25
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:06,200
Then he wiped his mouth with his fingers.

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:14,870
"Does the name Antonio Stradivarius mean anything
to you?" he asked.

27
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,640
"Are you saying that you have a fiddle made
by Stradivarius in that case?"

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,470
"I'm not saying what I have," McCord said.

29
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,920
Boone Elliot leaned forward in his chair.

30
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:42,280
"Mister, if you have a Stradivarius violin
I want to see it."

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:50,440
McCord opened the case and lifted up a violin
made of golden red wood.

32
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,930
The sunlight slid over the violin like a warm
wave.

33
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,230
"Here, take it," McCord said.

34
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,140
Boone tried to reach for the violin but his
hands would not move.

35
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,640
Boone had always thought he would find a Stradivarius
in a museum some day.

36
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,100
He never dreamed that he would see one in
his own home.

37
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:28,130
McCord turned the violin so that Boone could
read the writing on the back of it.

38
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,930
"See that?" he asked.

39
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,330
"Antonio Stradivarius.

40
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,140
Romona, Italia," he read.

41
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:49,500
As Boone leaned forward to read the words
himself McCord placed the violin in his hands.

42
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,180
"Go ahead," he said.

43
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,520
"Play something."

44
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,980
Boone put the violin under his chin and picked
up the bow.

45
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:08,230
He began to play "The Tennessee Waltz."

46
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:14,410
The violin sounded so good, he began to play
faster.

47
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:21,090
Nothing in his life had ever felt so wonderful.

48
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:29,690
Then Boone played "I am Thinking of My Blue
Eyes" for Molly.

49
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:36,560
He finished with the religious song "Amazing
Grace."

50
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,340
As he played the song, McCord and Molly sang
the words.

51
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,810
When Boone finished playing McCord shook his
head.

52
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,630
"Too bad I have to sell this fiddle," he said.

53
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:04,030
"But I have a sick child at home and I need
the money."

54
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,880
Boone put the violin back in its case.

55
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,720
"How much do you want for it?" he asked.

56
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,500
"Well," McCord said.

57
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:27,680
"I need 1500 dollars to pay the doctor and
the hospital."

58
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,360
Boone had expected the violin to cost much
more than that.

59
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,500
"Maybe, I will buy it myself," he said.

60
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,690
"Can you lower the price?"

61
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,000
McCord shook his head, "No.

62
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,620
No, I...

63
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,310
I need 1500 dollars for my child."

64
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,050
Boone thought for a minute.

65
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,670
"All right," he said.

66
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,550
"I will buy it.

67
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,690
But...

68
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,870
I can't give you the money until I go to the
bank tomorrow."

69
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,390
He handed the violin to McCord.

70
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,370
"No," McCord said.

71
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,150
"Keep it, friend.

72
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,020
It's yours."

73
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,380
They shook hands, and Molly invited McCord
to stay for dinner.

74
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:35,240
After dinner, McCord left and Molly began
washing the dishes.

75
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,140
She was very angry.

76
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:45,850
"How could you spend so much money without
talking to me about it?

77
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,340
Besides, you already have a violin."

78
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,720
Molly banged the pots she was washing as she
talked.

79
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,979
"I don't believe that story about a sick baby,"
she said.

80
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,389
"I don't either," Boone said.

81
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:10,150
"In fact, I don't even think McCord is married.

82
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:17,780
But I could not argue about that violin."

83
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,710
Boone put his arms around Molly and held her
close.

84
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,400
She turned and rested her head on his chest.

85
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,100
"I never should've married a musician," she
sighed.

86
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,890
"There's still some coffee left," she said.

87
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,810
"And I saved you a piece of pie."

88
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,259
The next morning McCord came to the house
early.

89
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,300
And the two men went into town to the bank.

90
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,400
Boone had no trouble borrowing the money to
buy the violin.

91
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:07,259
He promised Mr. Austin, the banker, that he
would work at Sam Boatwright's Garage to pay

92
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,460
off the bank loan.

93
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:18,590
After he got the money Boone gave it to McCord
who stuffed it in his pocket.

94
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,060
Boone walked across the street to Boatwright's
Garage.

95
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:32,800
It took Boone five years to pay the bank the
money he had borrowed to buy the Stradivarius.

96
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,700
Then, Boone had more time to play his violin.

97
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:46,310
He played at dances and at funerals; he played
in churches and schools.

98
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,710
Boone remembered those years as the best in
his life.

99
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,010
He called them his "golden time."

100
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,760
He could tell Molly felt good too.

101
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,830
She was very loving and he felt very close
to her.

102
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:13,130
Whenever Boone picked up his Stradivarius
he felt as if God's spirit had touched his

103
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,960
soul.

104
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:23,390
Then Molly became sick and the golden time
ended.

105
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,860
Boone took her to the hospital where the doctors
operated on her.

106
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,940
For a while Molly felt better.

107
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,470
But she had lost a lot of weight and was very
weak.

108
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:46,220
Boone went back to work at Boatwright's Garage
to pay Molly's doctors and the hospital.

109
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:52,279
But the money he got from working in the garage
was not enough.

110
00:09:52,279 --> 00:10:01,420
So, he returned to Mr. Austin at the bank
and borrowed several thousand dollars.

111
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,640
Even that was not enough.

112
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:11,380
In the end, there was Just one thing left
for him to do.

113
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:17,380
The idea was so awful that he put off doing
it for as long as he could.

114
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:26,260
Finally, one day he took the Stradivarius
from its case for the last time.

115
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:34,230
He held it in his arms as if it were a baby,
but he was too sad to play it.

116
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:40,220
Then he put the violin in his truck and drove
to the city.

117
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,140
The first music store he went to was not interested
in the violin.

118
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,500
The second store offered him fifty dollars
for it.

119
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:58,610
The last store offered him seventy-five dollars.

120
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:04,320
Boone expected to get at least ten thousand
dollars for his violin.

121
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,770
After all, it was a Stradivarius!

122
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:13,500
It was clear they did not know how valuable
it was.

123
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,730
Finally, he went to the biggest music store
in the city.

124
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:24,890
"I have to sell my fiddle," he told the manager.

125
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,070
The manager opened the case and picked' up
the violin.

126
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:36,250
"Did you get this fiddle from a man named
McCord?" he asked.

127
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,690
"How did you know that?"

128
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,399
The manager put the violin back in its case.

129
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:53,420
"Every year we see five or six of these imitation
Stradivarius violins," he said.

130
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,570
"They all come from this man McCord.

131
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:05,640
This violin of yours, when new, was worth
about two hundred dollars.

132
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:12,020
I can only give you about... a hundred dollars
for It, though."

133
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,700
Boone could feel his face become hot.

134
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,970
"Thank you very much, sir, " he said.

135
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,120
He picked up the violin and left the store.

136
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,510
McCord had lied and cheated him.

137
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:39,610
He had taken Boone's 1500 dollars and given
him an Imitation Stradivarius.

138
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:46,240
Boone decided that he would look for McCord
and punish him.

139
00:12:46,240 --> 00:13:02,030
Yes, he promised himself, he would find McCord
even if it took him the rest of his life...

140
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:07,810
Then Boone drove to the hospital to see Molly.

141
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,850
But she had died a few minutes before he got
there.

142
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,880
The doctor said she died peacefully.

143
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,910
But Boone did not believe him.

144
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:24,950
For him the whole world was full of liars
now.

145
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:30,580
And all the lies began with McCord.

146
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,220
Two days later Boone buried Molly.

147
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,040
Molly's hospital bill was almost 10 thousand
dollars.

148
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,820
Boone sold his home to pay it.

149
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:53,940
He rented a small room in town and went to
work fixing cars in Sam Boatwright's Garage.

150
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:01,490
When he saved 500 dollars Boone quit his job
at the garage.

151
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:08,000
He got into his truck and drove away to look
for McCord.

152
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,180
When he came to a town he would ask if anybody
there knew Jesse McCord.

153
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:24,930
Near the end of August during the second year
of his search he arrived in the town of Merryville,

154
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,580
Tennessee.

155
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,800
He found a woman there who said she knew Jesse
McCord.

156
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,150
She told Boone where McCord lived.

157
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:42,180
He got into his truck and followed a dirt
road out of town.

158
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:50,130
He drove for fifteen kilometers to an old
farmhouse.

159
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:56,970
The house was so old that it looked ready
to fall down.

160
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:05,820
An old man wearing a dark wool cap and a dirty
coat sat in front of the house.

161
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,660
He seemed to be sleeping.

162
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,160
Boone drove up to the house and got out of
his truck.

163
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,590
The old man opened his eyes.

164
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,620
Boone looked at him closely.

165
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,820
The man's skin was gray and dirty.

166
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,690
A thick moustache of hair covered his upper
up.

167
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:36,220
His face was thin and his chin was pointed.

168
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,690
"Are you Jesse McCord?"

169
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,860
Boone asked softly.

170
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,600
"I am what is left of him," the old man said.

171
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,389
"Who the hell are you?"

172
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:56,100
"I'm Boone Elliot."

173
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,970
The old man stared at him.

174
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,480
"Do I know you?"

175
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,209
"You sold me a fiddle."

176
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:12,240
McCord sighed, "I sold hundreds of fiddles.

177
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,370
Have you come to thank me?"

178
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:23,380
Boone shook his head, "I've come to kill you."

179
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,880
The old man laughed weakly, "You're too late.

180
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,589
I'm dead already.

181
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,329
If I live through the night, it will be a
miracle.

182
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:40,350
I haven't eaten in two days."

183
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,149
Tears filled his eyes and rolled down his
thin cheeks.

184
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:53,750
"I've done a lot of bad things in my life,"
the old man said.

185
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,630
"But I don't deserve to die like this.

186
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,430
Please, help me, mister."

187
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,569
McCord fainted.

188
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:11,680
Boone carried him into the house and tried
to find a place to put him down.

189
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,390
He walked into the bedroom.

190
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:21,209
There were no sheets on the bed and the mattress
was torn.

191
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:23,270
Boone put McCord on the bed.

192
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:28,840
"I'm going to get some food," he said.

193
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,590
"Don't die while I'm gone."

194
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,390
Boone climbed into his truck and drove back
to town as fast as he could.

195
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:46,590
He didn't want to help McCord, but once he
started he could not stop.

196
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,380
McCord was asleep when he got back to the
farm.

197
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,540
Boone looked down at him.

198
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,740
Suddenly, he became very angry.

199
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:03,250
"I should've known you wouldn't die!" he yelled.

200
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:09,450
Boone went into the kitchen and filled some
large pots with water.

201
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,740
He put the pots on the stove to heat up.

202
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,650
When the water was hot he brought one pot
into the bedroom.

203
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:26,190
He took off McCord's dirty clothing and washed
the old man's body.

204
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,570
He looked for clean clothes but there weren't
any.

205
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:39,460
So, Boone took some of his own clothing out
of his suitcase and put them on McCord.

206
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:46,380
When he finished he heated some soup and brought
it to McCord.

207
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,970
The old man was too weak to feed himself.

208
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,330
So Boone fed him the soup.

209
00:18:54,330 --> 00:19:01,870
The next morning, McCord was strong enough
to sit up and feed himself.

210
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:07,480
After he ate, McCord sat on the porch with
Boone.

211
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,850
"How long have you been looking for me?"

212
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,620
McCord asked.

213
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,970
Boone shook his head, "I don't remember."

214
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,610
"Have you still got the fiddle?"

215
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,049
McCord asked.

216
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:27,320
Boone looked at the old man.

217
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,130
"Of course, I have it.

218
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,480
Who would I sell it to?"

219
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,670
McCord smiled, "Why don't you play me something
on that fiddle?"

220
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,580
"I can't," Boone said.

221
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:54,820
"Too much has happened - my wife died, I lost
my home and all my money.

222
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:01,600
And it all started because you sold me that
fiddle for ten times its real value."

223
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,570
"That may be true," McCord said.

224
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,669
"But it is still the same fiddle.

225
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:13,419
It isn't the fiddle that changed."

226
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:16,150
He began to cough.

227
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,730
Boone leaned toward him.

228
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,780
"Are you all right?" he asked.

229
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,140
"Hmm...

230
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,900
No," McCord said.

231
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,620
He coughed some more and his eyes filled 'with
tears.

232
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,200
McCord grabbed Boone's arm.

233
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,810
"Don't bury me in the cemetery in town," he
said.

234
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:48,580
"I want to be buried in the old cemetery behind
the church at the end of the road.

235
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,840
Some of my people are there."

236
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,559
Boone stood over him.

237
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:59,850
"Don't you have any family living around here?"
he asked.

238
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,380
"No," the old man said.

239
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:08,920
"You are the only person I have."

240
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,870
That night McCord coughed so much that Boone
could not sleep.

241
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,320
Later there was a storm with thunder and lightning.

242
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:28,710
Some time during the storm McCord stopped
coughing and quietly died.

243
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:36,220
The next morning, Boone wrapped McCord's body
in a sheet and buried him in the cemetery

244
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,140
behind the church.

245
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:45,210
A man should be buried where he wants, Boone,
thought.

246
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:54,060
After he filled the grave with the dirt Boone
went to his truck and took out the fiddle.

247
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:00,780
He carefully tuned the fiddle's strings and
began to play.

248
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,059
The first song was "Amazing Grace."

249
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:10,630
He and Molly used to sing the song in church
on Sundays.

250
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:20,260
Then he played "The Tennessee Waltz," because
he thought McCord would've liked it.

251
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:33,039
And finally, he played "I'm Thinking Tonight
of My Blue Eyes" for Molly, because he had

252
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,440
not played any music at her funeral.

253
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:36,790
- THE END -
