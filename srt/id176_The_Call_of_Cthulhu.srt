00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:20,180
Of such great powers or beings there may be
conceivably a survival… a survival of a

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,340
hugely remote period when… consciousness
was manifested, perhaps, in shapes and forms

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:32,070
long since withdrawn before the tide of advancing
humanity… forms of which poetry and legend

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:40,430
alone have caught a flying memory and called
them gods, monsters, mythical beings of all

8
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,079
sorts and kinds…

- Algernon Blackwood

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:56,739
I. The Horror In Clay
The most merciful thing in the world, I think,

11
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:05,110
is the inability of the human mind to correlate
all its contents. We live on a placid island

12
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,760
of ignorance in the midst of black seas of
infinity, and it was not meant that we should

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:18,210
voyage far. The sciences, each straining in
its own direction, have hitherto harmed us

14
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,790
little; but some day the piecing together
of dissociated knowledge will open up such

15
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:32,080
terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful
position therein, that we shall either go

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:43,200
mad from the revelation or flee from the light
into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,730
Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur
of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and

18
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:56,150
human race form transient incidents. They
have hinted at strange survivals in terms

19
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:03,500
which would freeze the blood if not masked
by a bland optimism. But it is not from them

20
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,420
that there came the single glimpse of forbidden
eons which chills me when I think of it and

21
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:16,020
maddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse,
like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed

22
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:23,720
out from an accidental piecing together of
separated things - in this case an old newspaper

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,130
item and the notes of a dead professor. I
hope that no one else will accomplish this

24
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:36,070
piecing out; certainly, if I live, I shall
never knowingly supply a link in so hideous

25
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,569
a chain. I think that the professor, too intented
to keep silent regarding the part he knew,

26
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:47,300
and that he would have destroyed his notes
had not sudden death seized him.

27
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,590
My knowledge of the thing began in the winter
of 1926-27 with the death of my great-uncle,

28
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,569
George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus
of Semitic Languages in Brown University,

29
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:05,040
Providence, Rhode Island. Professor Angell
was widely known as an authority on ancient

30
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,160
inscriptions, and had frequently been resorted
to by the heads of prominent museums; so that

31
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,739
his passing at the age of ninety-two may be
recalled by many. Locally, interest was intensified

32
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:24,190
by the obscurity of the cause of death. The
professor had been stricken whilst returning

33
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,060
from the Newport boat; falling suddenly; as
witnesses said, after having been jostled

34
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,690
by a nautical-looking negro who had come from
one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous

35
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,670
hillside which formed a short cut from the
waterfront to the deceased’s home in Williams

36
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:47,300
Street. Physicians were unable to find any
visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed

37
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:53,650
debate that some obscure lesion of the heart,
induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a

38
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:01,360
hill by so elderly a man, was responsible
for the end. At the time I saw no reason to

39
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:10,850
dissent from this dictum, but latterly I am
inclined to wonder - and more than wonder.

40
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,780
As my great-uncle’s heir and executor, for
he died a childless widower, I was expected

41
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,739
to go over his papers with some thoroughness;
and for that purpose moved his entire set

42
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:27,340
of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston.
Much of the material which I correlated will

43
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:33,309
be later published by the American Archaeological
Society, but there was one box which I found

44
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:41,469
exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much
averse from showing to other eyes. It had

45
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:46,909
been locked and I did not find the key till
it occurred to me to examine the personal

46
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:53,759
ring which the professor carried in his pocket.
Then, indeed, I succeeded in opening it, but

47
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,949
when I did so seemed only to be confronted
by a greater and more closely locked barrier.

48
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:05,539
For what could be the meaning of the queer
clay bas-relief and the disjointed jottings,

49
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:12,259
ramblings, and cuttings which I found? Had
my uncle, in his latter years become credulous

50
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:19,419
of the most superficial impostures? I resolved
to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible

51
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:24,809
for this apparent disturbance of an old man’s
peace of mind.

52
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:30,229
The bas-relief was a rough rectangle less
than an inch thick and about five by six inches

53
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:37,289
in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs,
however, were far from modern in atmosphere

54
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:42,569
and suggestion; for, although the vagaries
of cubism and futurism are many and wild,

55
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:49,919
they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity
which lurks in prehistoric writing. And writing

56
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,839
of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed
certainly to be; though my memory, despite

57
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,479
much the papers and collections of my uncle,
failed in any way to identify this particular

58
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,090
species, or even hint at its remotest affiliations.

59
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:12,879
Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure
of evident pictorial intent, though its impressionistic

60
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:20,289
execution forbade a very clear idea of its
nature. It seemed to be a sort of monster,

61
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:28,289
or symbol representing a monster, of a form
which only a diseased fancy could conceive.

62
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:35,740
If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination
yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus,

63
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,809
a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall
not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing.

64
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:48,819
A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque
and scaly body with rudimentary wings; but

65
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:55,380
it was the general outline of the whole which
made it most shockingly frightful. Behind

66
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,819
the figure was a vague suggestions of a Cyclopean
architectural background.

67
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,890
The writing accompanying this oddity was,
aside from a stack of press cuttings, in Professor

68
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:14,499
Angell’s most recent hand; and made no pretense
to literary style. What seemed to be the main

69
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:20,639
document was headed “CTHULHU CULT” in
characters painstakingly printed to avoid

70
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,809
the erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of.
This manuscript was divided into two sections,

71
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:35,449
the first of which was headed “1925 - Dream
and Dream Work of H.A. Wilcox, 7 Thomas St.,

72
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:42,080
Providence, R. I.”, and the second, “Narrative
of Inspector John R. Legrasse, 121 Bienville

73
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:51,139
St., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg.
- Notes on Same, & Prof. Webb’s Acct.”

74
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,839
The other manuscript papers were brief notes,
some of them accounts of the queer dreams

75
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,029
of different persons, some of them citations
from theosophical books and magazines (notably

76
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:07,879
W. Scott-Elliot’s Atlantis and the Lost
Lemuria ), and the rest comments on long-surviving

77
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:14,229
secret societies and hidden cults, with references
to passages in such mythological and anthropological

78
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:22,259
source-books as Frazer’s Golden Bough and
Miss Murray’s Witch-Cult in Western Europe.

79
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:28,969
The cuttings largely alluded to outr� mental
illness and outbreaks of group folly or mania

80
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:33,360
in the spring of 1925.

81
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,700
The first half of the principal manuscript
told a very particular tale. It appears that

82
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:47,420
on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man
of neurotic and excited aspect had called

83
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:53,519
upon Professor Angell bearing the singular
clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly

84
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:01,352
damp and fresh. His card bore the name of
Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle had recognized

85
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:06,120
him as the youngest son of an excellent family
slightly known to him, who had latterly been

86
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,240
studying sculpture at the Rhode Island School
of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys

87
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:18,170
Building near that institution. Wilcox was
a precocious youth of known genius but great

88
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,790
eccentricity, and had from chidhood excited
attention through the strange stories and

89
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:31,420
odd dreams he was in the habit of relating.
He called himself “psychically hypersensitive”,

90
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:38,440
but the staid folk of the ancient commercial
city dismissed him as merely “queer.”

91
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,670
Never mingling much with his kind, he had
dropped gradually from social visibility,

92
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,990
and was now known only to a small group of
esthetes from other towns. Even the Providence

93
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:55,680
Art Club, anxious to preserve its conservatism,
had found him quite hopeless.

94
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,899
On the ocassion of the visit, ran the professor’s
manuscript, the sculptor abruptly asked for

95
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,709
the benefit of his host’s archeological
knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics

96
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:13,949
of the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted
manner which suggested pose and alienated

97
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:19,279
sympathy; and my uncle showed some sharpness
in replying, for the conspicuous freshness

98
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:26,279
of the tablet implied kinship with anything
but archeology. Young Wilcox’s rejoinder,

99
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,860
which impressed my uncle enough to make him
recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically

100
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,699
poetic cast which must have typified his whole
conversation, and which I have since found

101
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:44,970
highly characteristic of him. He said, “It
is new, indeed, for I made it last night in

102
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:51,100
a dream of strange cities; and dreams are
older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative

103
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,259
Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon.”

104
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:00,399
It was then that he began that rambling tale
which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory

105
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,660
and won the fevered interest of my uncle.
There had been a slight earthquake tremor

106
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,620
the night before, the most considerable felt
in New England for some years; and Wilcox’s

107
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:19,470
imagination had been keenly affected. Upon
retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream

108
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:27,121
of great Cyclopean cities of Titan blocks
and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with

109
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:35,720
green ooze and sinister with latent horror.
Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars,

110
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,269
and from some undetermined point below had
come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic

111
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:48,279
sensation which only fancy could transmute
into sound, but which he attempted to render

112
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:57,399
by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters:
“Cthulhu fhtagn.”

113
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:04,329
This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection
which excited and disturbed Professor Angell.

114
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:09,730
He questioned the sculptor with scientific
minuteness; and studied with frantic intensity

115
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,069
the bas-relief on which the youth had found
himself working, chilled and clad only in

116
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:22,279
his night clothes, when waking had stolen
bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his

117
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:29,470
old age, Wilcox afterwards said, for his slowness
in recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial

118
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:35,149
design. Many of his questions seemed highly
out of place to his visitor, especially those

119
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:40,629
which tried to connect the latter with strange
cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand

120
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:45,430
the repeated promises of silence which he
was offered in exchange for an admission of

121
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:52,689
membership in some widespread mystical or
paganly religious body. When Professor Angell

122
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:57,399
became convinced that the sculptor was indeed
ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic

123
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:04,949
lore, he besieged his visitor with demands
for future reports of dreams. This bore regular

124
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:11,161
fruit, for after the first interview the manuscript
records daily calls of the young man, during

125
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:17,990
which he related startling fragments of nocturnal
imaginery whose burden was always some terrible

126
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:24,959
Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone,
with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting

127
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:32,649
monotonously in enigmatical sense-impacts
uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds

128
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:38,699
frequently repeated are those rendered by
the letters “Cthulhu” and “R’lyeh.”

129
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:46,910
On March 23, the manuscript continued, Wilcox
failed to appear; and inquiries at his quarters

130
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,730
revealed that he had been stricken with an
obscure sort of fever and taken to the home

131
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:58,459
of his family in Waterman Street. He had cried
out in the night, arousing several other artists

132
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:03,019
in the building, and had manifested since
then only alternations of unconsciousness

133
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:08,999
and delirium. My uncle at once telephoned
the family, and from that time forward kept

134
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:13,980
close watch of the case; calling often at
the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom

135
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,940
he learned to be in charge. The youth’s
febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on

136
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:26,040
strange things; and the doctor shuddered now
and then as he spoke of them. They included

137
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,180
not only a repetition of what he had formerly
dreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic

138
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:38,430
thing “miles high” which walked or lumbered
about.

139
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:44,600
He at no time fully described this object
but occasional frantic words, as repeated

140
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,759
by Dr. Tobey, convinced the professor that
it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity

141
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:55,410
he had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture.
Reference to this object, the doctor added,

142
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:01,439
was invariably a prelude to the young man’s
subsidence into lethargy. His temperature,

143
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:06,250
oddly enough, was not greatly above normal;
but the whole condition was otherwise such

144
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,140
as to suggest true fever rather than mental
disorder.

145
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:18,260
On April 2 at about 3 P.M. every trace of
Wilcox’s malady suddenly ceased. He sat

146
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,180
upright in bed, astonished to find himself
at home and completely ignorant of what had

147
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:30,649
happened in dream or reality since the night
of March 22. Pronounced well by his physician,

148
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:36,060
he returned to his quarters in three days;
but to Professor Angell he was of no further

149
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:43,569
assistance. All traces of strange dreaming
had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle

150
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:48,459
kept no record of his night-thoughts after
a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts

151
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,589
of thoroughly usual visions.

152
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:57,699
Here the first part of the manuscript ended,
but references to certain of the scattered

153
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:04,160
notes gave me much material for thought - so
much, in fact, that only the ingrained skepticism

154
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,850
then forming my philosophy can account for
my continued distrust of the artist. The notes

155
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,680
in question were those descriptive of the
dreams of various persons covering the same

156
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,990
period as that in which young Wilcox had had
his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems,

157
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:27,759
had quickly instituted a prodigiously far-flung
body of inquires amongst nearly all the friends

158
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,320
whom he could question without impertinence,
asking for nightly reports of their dreams,

159
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:39,189
and the dates of any notable visions for some
time past. The reception of his request seems

160
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:44,689
to have varied; but he must, at the very least,
have received more responses than any ordinary

161
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:51,750
man could have handled without a secretary.
This original correspondence was not preserved,

162
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:57,850
but his notes formed a thorough and really
significant digest. Average people in society

163
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,019
and business - New England’s traditional
“salt of the earth” - gave an almost completely

164
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:08,959
negative result, though scattered cases of
uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions

165
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:16,750
appear here and there, always between March
23 and and April 2 - the period of young Wilcox’s

166
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:23,150
delirium. Scientific men were little more
affected, though four cases of vague description

167
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:29,159
suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes,
and in one case there is mentioned a dread

168
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:31,940
of something abnormal.

169
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:38,600
It was from the artists and poets that the
pertinent answers came, and I know that panic

170
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,310
would have broken loose had they been able
to compare notes. As it was, lacking their

171
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:50,059
original letters, I half suspected the compiler
of having asked leading questions, or of having

172
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:55,760
edited the correspondence in corroboration
of what he had latently resolved to see. That

173
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,760
is why I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow
cognizant of the old data which my uncle had

174
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,320
possessed, had been imposing on the veteran
scientist. These responses from esthetes told

175
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:15,460
disturbing tale. From February 28 to April
2 a large proportion of them had dreamed very

176
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,340
bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams
being immeasurably the stronger during the

177
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,870
period of the sculptor’s delirium. Over
a fourth of those who reported anything, reported

178
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:31,299
scenes and half-sounds not unlike those which
Wilcox had described; and some of the dreamers

179
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:37,809
confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless
thing visible toward the last. One case, which

180
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:44,419
the note describes with emphasis, was very
sad. The subject, a widely known architect

181
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:50,409
with leanings toward theosophy and occultism,
went violently insane on the date of young

182
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:56,460
Wilcox’s seizure, and expired several months
later after incessant screamings to be saved

183
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:03,400
from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my
uncle referred to these cases by name instead

184
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,029
of merely by number, I should have attempted
some corroboration and personal investigation;

185
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:15,080
but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down
only a few. All of these, however, bore out

186
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:21,470
the notes in full. I have often wondered if
all the the objects of the professor’s questioning

187
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:28,010
felt as puzzled as did this fraction. It is
well that no explanation shall ever reach

188
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,010
them.

189
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:34,649
The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched
on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity

190
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:40,020
during the given period. Professor Angell
must have employed a cutting bureau, for the

191
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,029
number of extracts was tremendous, and the
sources scattered throughout the globe. Here

192
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:50,120
was a nocturnal suicide in London, where a
lone sleeper had leaped from a window after

193
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,450
a shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter
to the editor of a paper in South America,

194
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:02,600
where a fanatic deduces a dire future from
visions he has seen. A dispatch from California

195
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,220
describes a theosophist colony as donning
white robes en masse for some “glorious

196
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,299
fulfiment” which never arrives, whilst items
from India speak guardedly of serious native

197
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:18,769
unrest toward the end of March 22-23.

198
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:24,409
The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild
rumour and legendry, and a fantastic painter

199
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:32,000
named Ardois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous Dream
Landscape in the Paris spring salon of 1926.

200
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,090
And so numerous are the recorded troubles
in insane asylums that only a miracle can

201
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:42,059
have stopped the medical fraternity from noting
strange parallelisms and drawing mystified

202
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:49,720
conclusions. A weird bunch of cuttings, all
told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage

203
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:56,220
the callous rationalism with which I set them
aside. But I was then convinced that young

204
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:09,990
Wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned
by 

205
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,950
the professor.

206
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:25,110
II. The Tale of Inspector Legrasse.
The older matters which had made the sculptor’s

207
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:30,559
dream and bas-relief so significant to my
uncle formed the subject of the second half

208
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:37,169
of his long manuscript. Once before, it appears,
Professor Angell had seen the hellish outlines

209
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:42,440
of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over
the unknown hieroglyphics, and heard the ominous

210
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,400
syllables which can be rendered only as “Cthulhu”
; and all this in so stirring and horrible

211
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,580
a connexion that it is small wonder he pursued
young Wilcox with queries and demands for

212
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,519
data.

213
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:03,299
This earlier experience had come in 1908,
seventeen years before, when the American

214
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:09,450
Archaeological Society held its annual meeting
in St. Louis. Professor Angell, as befitted

215
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:15,160
one of his authority and attainments, had
had a prominent part in all the deliberations;

216
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,450
and was one of the first to be approached
by the several outsiders who took advantage

217
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,830
of the convocation to offer questions for
correct answering and problems for expert

218
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,649
solution.

219
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:32,640
The chief of these outsiders, and in a short
time the focus of interest for the entire

220
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,820
meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged
man who had travelled all the way from New

221
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:46,960
Orleans for certain special information unobtainable
from any local source. His name was John Raymond

222
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:54,500
Legrasse, and he was by profession an Inspector
of Police. With him he bore the subject of

223
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:01,610
his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently
very ancient stone statuette whose origin

224
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:06,680
he was at a loss to determine. It must not
be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the

225
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:11,770
least interest in archaeology. On the contrary,
his wish for enlightenment was prompted by

226
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:18,760
purely professional considerations. The statuette,
idol, fetish, or whatever it was, had been

227
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,919
captured some months before in the wooded
swamps south of New Orleans during a raid

228
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,789
on a supposed voodoo meeting; and so singular
and hideous were the rites connected with

229
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:35,590
it, that the police could not but realise
that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally

230
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:42,289
unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic
than even the blackest of the African voodoo

231
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:49,000
circles. Of its origin, apart from the erratic
and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured

232
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,830
members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered;
hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian

233
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:01,210
lore which might help them to place the frightful
symbol, and through it track down the cult

234
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,899
to its fountain-head.

235
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:10,180
Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for
the sensation which his offering created.

236
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,200
One sight of the thing had been enough to
throw the assembled men of science into a

237
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,500
state of tense excitement, and they lost no
time in crowding around him to gaze at the

238
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:26,320
diminutive figure whose utter strangeness
and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted

239
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:34,450
so potently at unopened and archaic vistas.
No recognised school of sculpture had animated

240
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:40,010
this terrible object, yet centuries and even
thousands of years seemed recorded in its

241
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:45,279
dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone.

242
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,890
The figure, which was finally passed slowly
from man to man for close and careful study,

243
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:57,539
was between seven and eight inches in height,
and of exquisitely artistic workmanship. It

244
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:05,430
represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid
outline, but with an octopus-like head whose

245
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:14,250
face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking
body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet,

246
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:22,480
and long, narrow wings behind. This thing,
which seemed instinct with a fearsome and

247
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:30,029
unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated
corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular

248
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:37,070
block or pedestal covered with undecipherable
characters. The tips of the wings touched

249
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,870
the back edge of the block, the seat occupied
the centre, whilst the long, curved claws

250
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:48,480
of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped
the front edge and extended a quarter of the

251
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,870
way down toward the bottom of the pedestal.
The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that

252
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:59,490
the ends of the facial feelers brushed the
backs of huge fore paws which clasped the

253
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:06,300
croucher’s elevated knees. The aspect of
the whole was abnormally life-like, and the

254
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:14,490
more subtly fearful because its source was
so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and

255
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:20,500
incalculable age was unmistakable; yet not
one link did it shew with any known type of

256
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,429
art belonging to civilisation’s youth - or
indeed to any other time. Totally separate

257
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:32,600
and apart, its very material was a mystery;
for the soapy, greenish-black stone with its

258
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:39,510
golden or iridescent flecks and striations
resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy.

259
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,980
The characters along the base were equally
baffling; and no member present, despite a

260
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,830
representation of half the world’s expert
learning in this field, could form the least

261
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:55,570
notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship.
They, like the subject and material, belonged

262
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:01,600
to something horribly remote and distinct
from mankind as we know it. something frightfully

263
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,630
suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of
life in which our world and our conceptions

264
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,440
have no part.

265
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,730
And yet, as the members severally shook their
heads and confessed defeat at the Inspector’s

266
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:22,669
problem, there was one man in that gathering
who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity

267
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:28,669
in the monstrous shape and writing, and who
presently told with some diffidence of the

268
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:37,330
odd trifle he knew. This person was the late
William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology

269
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:44,509
in Princeton University, and an explorer of
no slight note. Professor Webb had been engaged,

270
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:49,960
forty-eight years before, in a tour of Greenland
and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions

271
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,529
which he failed to unearth; and whilst high
up on the West Greenland coast had encountered

272
00:27:54,529 --> 00:28:02,570
a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Esquimaux
whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship,

273
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:08,149
chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness
and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which

274
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:12,970
other Esquimaux knew little, and which they
mentioned only with shudders, saying that

275
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:21,230
it had come down from horribly ancient aeons
before ever the world was made. Besides nameless

276
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:28,139
rites and human sacrifices there were certain
queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme

277
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:34,690
elder devil or tornasuk; and of this Professor
Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from

278
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:40,590
an aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing
the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew

279
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:47,169
how. But just now of prime significance was
the fetish which this cult had cherished,

280
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:53,600
and around which they danced when the aurora
leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the

281
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,690
professor stated, a very crude bas-relief
of stone, comprising a hideous picture and

282
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:06,970
some cryptic writing. And so far as he could
tell, it was a rough parallel in all essential

283
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:13,690
features of the bestial thing now lying before
the meeting.

284
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:19,440
This data, received with suspense and astonishment
by the assembled members, proved doubly exciting

285
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,270
to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at once
to ply his informant with questions. Having

286
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:30,919
noted and copied an oral ritual among the
swamp cult-worshippers his men had arrested,

287
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:36,620
he besought the professor to remember as best
he might the syllables taken down amongst

288
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:42,900
the diabolist Esquimaux. There then followed
an exhaustive comparison of details, and a

289
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:52,070
moment of really awed silence when both detective
and scientist agreed on the virtual identity

290
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:59,130
of the phrase common to two hellish rituals
so many worlds of distance apart. What, in

291
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,200
substance, both the Esquimaux wizards and
the Louisiana swamp-priests had chanted to

292
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,640
their kindred idols was something very like
this: the word-divisions being guessed at

293
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,620
from traditional breaks in the phrase as chanted
aloud:

294
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:24,740
“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh
wgah’nagl fhtagn.”

295
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:30,500
Legrasse had one point in advance of Professor
Webb, for several among his mongrel prisoners

296
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:36,309
had repeated to him what older celebrants
had told them the words meant. This text,

297
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:38,880
as given, ran something like this:

298
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:46,700
“In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits
dreaming.”

299
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:52,659
And now, in response to a general and urgent
demand, Inspector Legrasse related as fully

300
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:57,929
as possible his experience with the swamp
worshippers; telling a story to which I could

301
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:05,009
see my uncle attached profound significance.
It savoured of the wildest dreams of myth-maker

302
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:11,200
and theosophist, and disclosed an astonishing
degree of cosmic imagination among such half-castes

303
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,309
and pariahs as might be least expected to
possess it.

304
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:21,940
On November 1st, 1907, there had come to the
New Orleans police a frantic summons from

305
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:27,889
the swamp and lagoon country to the south.
The squatters there, mostly primitive but

306
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:33,970
good-natured descendants of Lafitte’s men,
were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown

307
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:40,120
thing which had stolen upon them in the night.
It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a

308
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,250
more terrible sort than they had ever known;
and some of their women and children had disappeared

309
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:50,549
since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its
incessant beating far within the black haunted

310
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:58,960
woods where no dweller ventured. There were
insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling

311
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,550
chants and dancing devil-flames; and, the
frightened messenger added, the people could

312
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,690
stand it no more.

313
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:12,529
So a body of twenty police, filling two carriages
and an automobile, had set out in the late

314
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:18,010
afternoon with the shivering squatter as a
guide. At the end of the passable road they

315
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:23,890
alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence
through the terrible cypress woods where day

316
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:30,320
never came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging
nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now

317
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,889
and then a pile of dank stones or fragment
of a rotting wall intensified by its hint

318
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:42,029
of morbid habitation a depression which every
malformed tree and every fungous islet combined

319
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:48,950
to create. At length the squatter settlement,
a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight;

320
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:53,870
and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster
around the group of bobbing lanterns. The

321
00:32:53,870 --> 00:33:01,340
muffled beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible
far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came

322
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:07,230
at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted.
A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through

323
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:12,899
pale undergrowth beyond the endless avenues
of forest night. Reluctant even to be left

324
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:18,160
alone again, each one of the cowed squatters
refused point-blank to advance another inch

325
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:24,840
toward the scene of unholy worship, so Inspector
Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged

326
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:32,429
on unguided into black arcades of horror that
none of them had ever trod before.

327
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:38,070
The region now entered by the police was one
of traditionally evil repute, substantially

328
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:45,190
unknown and untraversed by white men. There
were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by

329
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:53,290
mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless
white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and

330
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:58,659
squatters whispered that bat-winged devils
flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship

331
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:05,029
it at midnight. They said it had been there
before d’Iberville, before La Salle, before

332
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:11,830
the Indians, and before even the wholesome
beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare

333
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:19,280
itself, and to see it was to die. But it made
men dream, and so they knew enough to keep

334
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,780
away. The present voodoo orgy was, indeed,
on the merest fringe of this abhorred area,

335
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:32,550
but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps
the very place of the worship had terrified

336
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:37,330
the squatters more than the shocking sounds
and incidents.

337
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:43,840
Only poetry or madness could do justice to
the noises heard by Legrasse’s men as they

338
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:50,110
ploughed on through the black morass toward
the red glare and muffled tom-toms. There

339
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:57,940
are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal
qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is terrible

340
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:04,940
to hear the one when the source should yield
the other. Animal fury and orgiastic license

341
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:11,820
here whipped themselves to daemoniac heights
by howls and squawking ecstacies that tore

342
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:17,570
and reverberated through those nighted woods
like pestilential tempests from the gulfs

343
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:25,270
of hell. Now and then the less organized ululation
would cease, and from what seemed a well-drilled

344
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:33,810
chorus of hoarse voices would rise in sing-song
chant that hideous phrase or ritual:

345
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:42,610
“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh
wgah’nagl fhtagn.”

346
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:49,790
Then the men, having reached a spot where
the trees were thinner, came suddenly in sight

347
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:56,840
of the spectacle itself. Four of them reeled,
one fainted, and two were shaken into a frantic

348
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:03,760
cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately
deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the

349
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,450
face of the fainting man, and all stood trembling
and nearly hypnotised with horror.

350
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:16,351
In a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy
island of perhaps an acre’s extent, clear

351
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:24,330
of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped
and twisted a more indescribable horde of

352
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:32,930
human abnormality than any but a Sime or an
Angarola could paint. Void of clothing, this

353
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:41,050
hybrid spawn were braying, bellowing, and
writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped bonfire;

354
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:46,150
in the centre of which, revealed by occasional
rifts in the curtain of flame, stood a great

355
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:52,430
granite monolith some eight feet in height;
on top of which, incongruous in its diminutiveness,

356
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:58,730
rested the noxious carven statuette. From
a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular

357
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:05,740
intervals with the flame-girt monolith as
a centre hung, head downward, the oddly marred

358
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:12,870
bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared.
It was inside this circle that the ring of

359
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:17,660
worshippers jumped and roared, the general
direction of the mass motion being from left

360
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:23,560
to right in endless Bacchanal between the
ring of bodies and the ring of fire.

361
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:30,250
It may have been only imagination and it may
have been only echoes which induced one of

362
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:36,660
the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he
heard antiphonal responses to the ritual from

363
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:45,550
some far and unillumined spot deeper within
the wood of ancient legendry and horror. This

364
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:53,570
man, Joseph D. Galvez, I later met and questioned;
and he proved distractingly imaginative. He

365
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:59,210
indeed went so far as to hint of the faint
beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of

366
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:06,550
shining eyes and a mountainous white bulk
beyond the remotest trees but I suppose he

367
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:10,210
had been hearing too much native superstition.

368
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:18,240
Actually, the horrified pause of the men was
of comparatively brief duration. Duty came

369
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,660
first; and although there must have been nearly
a hundred mongrel celebrants in the throng,

370
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:30,500
the police relied on their firearms and plunged
determinedly into the nauseous rout. For five

371
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:37,370
minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond
description. Wild blows were struck, shots

372
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:43,860
were fired, and escapes were made; but in
the end Legrasse was able to count some forty-seven

373
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:49,290
sullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress
in haste and fall into line between two rows

374
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:55,290
of policemen. Five of the worshippers lay
dead, and two severely wounded ones were carried

375
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:01,260
away on improvised stretchers by their fellow-prisoners.
The image on the monolith, of course, was

376
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:06,790
carefully removed and carried back by Legrasse.

377
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:12,210
Examined at headquarters after a trip of intense
strain and weariness, the prisoners all proved

378
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:18,600
to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and
mentally aberrant type. Most were seamen,

379
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,970
and a sprinkling of Negroes and mulattoes,
largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from

380
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:30,510
the Cape Verde Islands, gave a colouring of
voodooism to the heterogeneous cult. But before

381
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:36,300
many questions were asked, it became manifest
that something far deeper and older than Negro

382
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:43,260
fetishism was involved. Degraded and ignorant
as they were, the creatures held with surprising

383
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,980
consistency to the central idea of their loathsome
faith.

384
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:55,110
They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old
Ones who lived ages before there were any

385
00:39:55,110 --> 00:40:02,670
men, and who came to the young world out of
the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now, inside

386
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:07,620
the earth and under the sea; but their dead
bodies had told their secrets in dreams to

387
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:15,830
the first men, who formed a cult which had
never died. This was that cult, and the prisoners

388
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:22,290
said it had always existed and always would
exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places

389
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:28,630
all over the world until the time when the
great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house

390
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:35,050
in the mighty city of R’lyeh under the waters,
should rise and bring the earth again beneath

391
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:41,450
his sway. Some day he would call, when the
stars were ready, and the secret cult would

392
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:45,010
always be waiting to liberate him.

393
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:55,400
Meanwhile no more must be told. There was
a secret which even torture could not extract.

394
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:02,890
Mankind was not absolutely alone among the
conscious things of earth, for shapes came

395
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:10,070
out of the dark to visit the faithful few.
But these were not the Great Old Ones. No

396
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:16,560
man had ever seen the Old Ones. The carven
idol was great Cthulhu, but none might say

397
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,990
whether or not the others were precisely like
him. No one could read the old writing now,

398
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:28,850
but things were told by word of mouth. The
chanted ritual was not the secret - that was

399
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:37,310
never spoken aloud, only whispered. The chant
meant only this: “In his house at R’lyeh

400
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:41,430
dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.”

401
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:46,310
Only two of the prisoners were found sane
enough to be hanged, and the rest were committed

402
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:52,070
to various institutions. All denied a part
in the ritual murders, and averred that the

403
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:58,070
killing had been done by Black Winged Ones
which had come to them from their immemorial

404
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:04,890
meeting-place in the haunted wood. But of
those mysterious allies no coherent account

405
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:11,930
could ever be gained. What the police did
extract, came mainly from the immensely aged

406
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:17,870
mestizo named Castro, who claimed to have
sailed to strange ports and talked with undying

407
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:21,930
leaders of the cult in the mountains of China.

408
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:27,850
Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend
that paled the speculations of theosophists

409
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:36,960
and made man and the world seem recent and
transient indeed. There had been aeons when

410
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,160
other Things ruled on the earth, and They
had had great cities. Remains of Them, he

411
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:49,410
said the deathless Chinamen had told him,
were still be found as Cyclopean stones on

412
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:57,910
islands in the Pacific. They all died vast
epochs of time before men came, but there

413
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:04,350
were arts which could revive Them when the
stars had come round again to the right positions

414
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:11,700
in the cycle of eternity. They had, indeed,
come themselves from the stars, and brought

415
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,670
Their images with Them.

416
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:20,900
These Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were
not composed altogether of flesh and blood.

417
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:26,740
They had shape - for did not this star-fashioned
image prove it? - but that shape was not made

418
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:33,120
of matter. When the stars were right, They
could plunge from world to world through the

419
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:40,390
sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could
not live. But although They no longer lived,

420
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:51,150
They would never really die. They all lay
in stone houses in Their great city of R’lyeh,

421
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:56,820
preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu
for a glorious surrection when the stars and

422
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:03,970
the earth might once more be ready for Them.
But at that time some force from outside must

423
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:10,240
serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells
that preserved them intact likewise prevented

424
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,700
Them from making an initial move, and They
could only lie awake in the dark and think

425
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:24,180
whilst uncounted millions of years rolled
by. They knew all that was occurring in the

426
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:31,980
universe, for Their mode of speech was transmitted
thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs.

427
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:38,640
When, after infinities of chaos, the first
men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the

428
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,040
sensitive among them by moulding their dreams;
for only thus could Their language reach the

429
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,580
fleshly minds of mammals.

430
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:52,741
Then, whispered Castro, those first men formed
the cult around tall idols which the Great

431
00:44:52,741 --> 00:45:00,370
Ones shewed them; idols brought in dim eras
from dark stars. That cult would never die

432
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:06,350
till the stars came right again, and the secret
priests would take great Cthulhu from His

433
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:17,140
tomb to revive His subjects and resume His
rule of earth. The time would be easy to know,

434
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:23,440
for then mankind would have become as the
Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good

435
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:30,680
and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside
and all men shouting and killing and revelling

436
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:38,820
in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would
teach them new ways to shout and kill and

437
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:45,790
revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth
would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and

438
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:53,780
freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate
rites, must keep alive the memory of those

439
00:45:53,780 --> 00:46:00,430
ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy
of their return.

440
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:06,640
In the elder time chosen men had talked with
the entombed Old Ones in dreams, but then

441
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:14,660
something happened. The great stone city R’lyeh,
with its monoliths and sepulchres, had sunk

442
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:21,000
beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full
of the one primal mystery through which not

443
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:29,730
even thought can pass, had cut off the spectral
intercourse. But memory never died, and the

444
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:34,340
high-priests said that the city would rise
again when the stars were right. Then came

445
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:40,570
out of the earth the black spirits of earth,
mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours

446
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:49,090
picked up in caverns beneath forgotten sea-bottoms.
But of them old Castro dared not speak much.

447
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:54,480
He cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount
of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more

448
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:01,770
in this direction. The size of the Old Ones,
too, he curiously declined to mention. Of

449
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:07,301
the cult, he said that he thought the centre
lay amid the pathless desert of Arabia, where

450
00:47:07,301 --> 00:47:14,610
Irem, the City of Pillars, dreams hidden and
untouched. It was not allied to the European

451
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:20,110
witch-cult, and was virtually unknown beyond
its members. No book had ever really hinted

452
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:24,510
of it, though the deathless Chinamen said
that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon

453
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:32,430
of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated
might read as they chose, especially the much-discussed

454
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:33,500
couplet:

455
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,980
That is not dead which can eternal lie,

456
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,870
And with strange aeons even death may die.

457
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:46,740
Legrasse, deeply impressed and not a little
bewildered, had inquired in vain concerning

458
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:52,000
the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro,
apparently, had told the truth when he said

459
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,180
that it was wholly secret. The authorities
at Tulane University could shed no light upon

460
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:01,920
either cult or image, and now the detective
had come to the highest authorities in the

461
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,870
country and met with no more than the Greenland
tale of Professor Webb.

462
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,850
The feverish interest aroused at the meeting
by Legrasse’s tale, corroborated as it was

463
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:17,860
by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent
correspondence of those who attended; although

464
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:24,440
scant mention occurs in the formal publications
of the society. Caution is the first care

465
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:31,300
of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry
and imposture. Legrasse for some time lent

466
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,340
the image to Professor Webb, but at the latter’s
death it was returned to him and remains in

467
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:43,380
his possession, where I viewed it not long
ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably

468
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:48,460
akin to the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.

469
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:53,340
That my uncle was excited by the tale of the
sculptor I did not wonder, for what thoughts

470
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,370
must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge
of what Legrasse had learned of the cult,

471
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:02,510
of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not
only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of

472
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:07,550
the swamp-found image and the Greenland devil
tablet, but had come in his dreams upon at

473
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:13,370
least three of the precise words of the formula
uttered alike by Esquimaux diabolists and

474
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:19,560
mongrel Louisianans?. Professor Angell’s
instant start on an investigation of the utmost

475
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:24,190
thoroughness was eminently natural; though
privately I suspected young Wilcox of having

476
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:29,770
heard of the cult in some indirect way, and
of having invented a series of dreams to heighten

477
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:36,820
and continue the mystery at my uncle’s expense.
The dream-narratives and cuttings collected

478
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:42,730
by the professor were, of course, strong corroboration;
but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance

479
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:49,850
of the whole subject led me to adopt what
I thought the most sensible conclusions. So,

480
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:55,140
after thoroughly studying the manuscript again
and correlating the theosophical and anthropological

481
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:00,930
notes with the cult narrative of Legrasse,
I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor

482
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:07,040
and give him the rebuke I thought proper for
so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged

483
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,920
man.

484
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:14,390
Wilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys
Building in Thomas Street, a hideous Victorian

485
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:19,570
imitation of seventeenth century Breton Architecture
which flaunts its stuccoed front amidst the

486
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:25,170
lovely colonial houses on the ancient hill,
and under the very shadow of the finest Georgian

487
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:32,470
steeple in America, I found him at work in
his rooms, and at once conceded from the specimens

488
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:38,620
scattered about that his genius is indeed
profound and authentic. He will, I believe,

489
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:44,260
some time be heard from as one of the great
decadents; for he has crystallised in clay

490
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:50,600
and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares
and phantasies which Arthur Machen evokes

491
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:56,790
in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith makes visible
in verse and in painting.

492
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:03,550
Dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect,
he turned languidly at my knock and asked

493
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:10,190
me my business without rising. Then I told
him who I was, he displayed some interest;

494
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:15,420
for my uncle had excited his curiosity in
probing his strange dreams, yet had never

495
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:22,330
explained the reason for the study. I did
not enlarge his knowledge in this regard,

496
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:29,280
but sought with some subtlety to draw him
out. In a short time I became convinced ofhis

497
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:36,050
absolute sincerity, for he spoke of the dreams
in a manner none could mistake. They and their

498
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:43,180
subconscious residuum had influenced his art
profoundly, and he shewed me a morbid statue

499
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:49,400
whose contours almost made me shake with the
potency of its black suggestion. He could

500
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:55,290
not recall having seen the original of this
thing except in his own dream bas-relief,

501
00:51:55,290 --> 00:52:03,090
but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly
under his hands. It was, no doubt, the giant

502
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:09,781
shape he had raved of in delirium. That he
really knew nothing of the hidden cult, save

503
00:52:09,781 --> 00:52:16,210
from what my uncle’s relentless catechism
had let fall, he soon made clear; and again

504
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:22,910
I strove to think of some way in which he
could possibly have received the weird impressions.

505
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:28,850
He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic
fashion; making me see with terrible vividness

506
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:35,760
the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone
- whose geometry, he oddly said, was all wrong

507
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:43,830
- and hear with frightened expectancy the
ceaseless, half-mental calling from underground:

508
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:52,220
“Cthulhu fhtagn”, “Cthulhu fhtagn.”

509
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:58,330
These words had formed part of that dread
ritual which told of dead Cthulhu’s dream-vigil

510
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:05,270
in his stone vault at R’lyeh, and I felt
deeply moved despite my rational beliefs.

511
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:11,570
Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of the cult
in some casual way, and had soon forgotten

512
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:18,730
it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading
and imagining. Later, by virtue of its sheer

513
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:23,940
impressiveness, it had found subconscious
expression in dreams, in the bas-relief, and

514
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:29,400
in the terrible statue I now beheld; so that
his imposture upon my uncle had been a very

515
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:36,480
innocent one. The youth was of a type, at
once slightly affected and slightly ill-mannered,

516
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:42,080
which I could never like, but I was willing
enough now to admit both his genius and his

517
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:50,840
honesty. I took leave of him amicably, and
wish him all the success his talent promises.

518
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:56,340
The matter of the cult still remained to fascinate
me, and at times I had visions of personal

519
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:02,880
fame from researches into its origin and connexions.
I visited New Orleans, talked with Legrasse

520
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,910
and others of that old-time raiding-party,
saw the frightful image, and even questioned

521
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:15,490
such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived.
Old Castro, unfortunately, had been dead for

522
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:22,150
some years. What I now heard so graphically
at first-hand, though it was really no more

523
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:27,990
than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle
had written, excited me afresh; for I felt

524
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:34,310
sure that I was on the track of a very real,
very secret, and very ancient religion whose

525
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:41,490
discovery would make me an anthropologist
of note. My attitude was still one of absolute

526
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:48,950
materialism, as I wish it still were, and
I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity

527
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:56,160
the coincidence of the dream notes and odd
cuttings collected by Professor Angell.

528
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:02,710
One thing I began to suspect, and which I
now fear I know, is that my uncle’s death

529
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:10,850
was far from natural. He fell on a narrow
hill street leading up from an ancient waterfront

530
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:18,530
swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless
push from a Negro sailor. I did not forget

531
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:23,010
the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the
cult-members in Louisiana, and would not be

532
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:29,490
surprised to learn of secret methods and rites
and beliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true,

533
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:36,980
have been let alone; but in Norway a certain
seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the

534
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:42,550
deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering
the sculptor’s data have come to sinister

535
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:49,800
ears?. I think Professor Angell died because
he knew too much, or because he was likely

536
00:55:49,800 --> 00:56:08,120
to learn too much. Whether I shall go as he
did remains to be seen, for I have learned

537
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:15,680
much now.

538
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:26,550
III. The Madness from the Sea
If heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon,

539
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:32,150
it will be a total effacing of the results
of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain

540
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:37,990
stray piece of shelf-paper. It was nothing
on which I would naturally have stumbled in

541
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:43,340
the course of my daily round, for it was an
old number of an Australian journal, the Sydney

542
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:50,589
Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had escaped
even the cutting bureau which had at the time

543
00:56:50,589 --> 00:56:55,310
of its issuance been avidly collecting material
for my uncle’s research.

544
00:56:55,310 --> 00:57:00,230
I had largely given over my inquiries into
what Professor Angell called the “Cthulhu

545
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:05,310
Cult”, and was visiting a learned friend
in Paterson, New Jersey; the curator of a

546
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:11,580
local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining
one day the reserve specimens roughly set

547
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:17,310
on the storage shelves in a rear room of the
museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture

548
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:22,720
in one of the old papers spread beneath the
stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have

549
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,800
mentioned, for my friend had wide affiliations
in all conceivable foreign parts; and the

550
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:35,460
picture was a half-tone cut of a hideous stone
image almost identical with that which Legrasse

551
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,610
had found in the swamp.

552
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:43,210
Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious
contents, I scanned the item in detail; and

553
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:48,600
was disappointed to find it of only moderate
length. What it suggested, however, was of

554
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,700
portentous significance to my flagging quest;
and I carefully tore it out for immediate

555
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,910
action. It read as follows:

556
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,810
MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA

557
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:04,720
Vigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand
Yacht in Tow. One Survivor and Dead Man Found

558
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,820
Aboard. Tale of Desperate Battle and Deaths
at Sea. Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars

559
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:15,670
of Strange Experience. Odd Idol Found in His
Possession. Inquiry to Follow.

560
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:21,510
The Morrison Co.‘s freighter Vigilant, bound
from Valparaiso, arrived this morning at its

561
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:27,390
wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the
battled and disabled but heavily armed steam

562
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:35,910
yacht Alert of Dunedin, N.Z., which was sighted
April 12th in S. Latitude 34�21’, W. Longitude

563
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:41,850
152�17’, with one living and one dead
man aboard.

564
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:47,440
The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and
on April 2nd was driven considerably south

565
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:53,420
of her course by exceptionally heavy storms
and monster waves. On April 12th the derelict

566
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:59,170
was sighted; and though apparently deserted,
was found upon boarding to contain one survivor

567
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:03,520
in a half-delirious condition and one man
who had evidently been dead for more than

568
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:10,820
a week. The living man was clutching a horrible
stone idol of unknown origin, about foot in

569
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:15,480
height, regarding whose nature authorities
at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and

570
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:20,470
the Museum in College Street all profess complete
bafflement, and which the survivor says he

571
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:26,070
found in the cabin of the yacht, in a small
carved shrine of common pattern.

572
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:32,800
This man, after recovering his senses, told
an exceedingly strange story of piracy and

573
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:38,950
slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian
of some intelligence, and had been second

574
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:44,850
mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland,
which sailed for Callao February 20th with

575
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:50,990
a complement of eleven men. The Emma, he says,
was delayed and thrown widely south of her

576
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:59,040
course by the great storm of March 1st, and
on March 22nd, in S. Latitude 49�51’ W.

577
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:05,310
Longitude 128�34’, encountered the Alert,
manned by a queer and evil-looking crew of

578
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:12,900
Kanakas and half-castes. Being ordered peremptorily
to turn back, Capt. Collins refused; whereupon

579
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:18,920
the strange crew began to fire savagely and
without warning upon the schooner with a peculiarly

580
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,700
heavy battery of brass cannon forming part
of the yacht’s equipment. The Emma ‘s

581
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:28,500
men shewed fight, says the survivor, and though
the schooner began to sink from shots beneath

582
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,900
the water-line they managed to heave alongside
their enemy and board her, grappling with

583
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:37,950
the savage crew on the yacht’s deck, and
being forced to kill them all, the number

584
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:42,040
being slightly superior, because of their
particularly abhorrent and desperate though

585
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,600
rather clumsy mode of fighting.

586
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:50,340
Three of the Emma’s men, including Capt.
Collins and First Mate Green, were killed;

587
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:54,170
and the remaining eight under Second Mate
Johansen proceeded to navigate the captured

588
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:58,800
yacht, going ahead in their original direction
to see if any reason for their ordering back

589
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:05,500
had existed. The next day, it appears, they
raised and landed on a small island, although

590
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:12,690
none is known to exist in that part of the
ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore,

591
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:18,420
though Johansen is queerly reticent about
this part of his story, and speaks only of

592
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:25,550
their falling into a rock chasm. Later, it
seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht

593
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:31,000
and tried to manage her, but were beaten about
by the storm of April 2nd, From that time

594
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,270
till his rescue on the 12th the man remembers
little, and he does not even recall when William

595
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:43,110
Briden, his companion, died. Briden’s death
reveals no apparent cause, and was probably

596
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:49,810
due to excitement or exposure. Cable advices
from Dunedin report that the Alert was well

597
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:55,281
known there as an island trader, and bore
an evil reputation along the waterfront, It

598
01:01:55,281 --> 01:02:00,650
was owned by a curious group of half-castes
whose frequent meetings and night trips to

599
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:05,330
the woods attracted no little curiosity; and
it had set sail in great haste just after

600
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:12,250
the storm and earth tremors of March 1st.
Our Auckland correspondent gives the Emma

601
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:17,480
and her crew an excellent reputation, and
Johansen is described as a sober and worthy

602
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:23,430
man. The admiralty will institute an inquiry
on the whole matter beginning tomorrow, at

603
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:27,460
which every effort will be made to induce
Johansen to speak more freely than he has

604
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:30,250
done hitherto.

605
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:34,800
This was all, together with the picture of
the hellish image; but what a train of ideas

606
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:40,650
it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries
of data on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence

607
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:46,710
that it had strange interests at sea as well
as on land. What motive prompted the hybrid

608
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:51,030
crew to order back the Emma as they sailed
about with their hideous idol? What was the

609
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:56,480
unknown island on which six of the Emma ‘s
crew had died, and about which the mate Johansen

610
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:02,200
was so secretive? What had the vice-admiralty’s
investigation brought out, and what was known

611
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:09,270
of the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvellous
of all, what deep and more than natural linkage

612
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:14,460
of dates was this which gave a malign and
now undeniable significance to the various

613
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:19,580
turns of events so carefully noted by my uncle?

614
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:24,290
March 1st - or February 28th according to
the International Date Line - the earthquake

615
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:30,170
and storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert
and her noisome crew had darted eagerly forth

616
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:34,960
as if imperiously summoned, and on the other
side of the earth poets and artists had begun

617
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:40,640
to dream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city
whilst a young sculptor had moulded in his

618
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:46,540
sleep the form of the dreaded Cthulhu. March
23rd the crew of the Emma landed on an unknown

619
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:51,640
island and left six men dead; and on that
date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a

620
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:57,650
heightened vividness and darkened with dread
of a giant monster’s malign pursuit, whilst

621
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:02,650
an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had
lapsed suddenly into delirium! And what of

622
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:08,830
this storm of April 2nd - the date on which
all dreams of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox

623
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:15,400
emerged unharmed from the bondage of strange
fever? What of all this - and of those hints

624
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:21,160
of old Castro about the sunken, star-born
Old Ones and their coming reign; their faithful

625
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:27,010
cult and their mastery of dreams? Was I tottering
on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man’s

626
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:33,010
power to bear? If so, they must be horrors
of the mind alone, for in some way the second

627
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:39,210
of April had put a stop to whatever monstrous
menace had begun its siege of mankind’s

628
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,670
soul.

629
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:46,230
That evening, after a day of hurried cabling
and arranging, I bade my host adieu and took

630
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:52,160
a train for San Francisco. In less than a
month I was in Dunedin; where, however, I

631
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:57,850
found that little was known of the strange
cult-members who had lingered in the old sea-taverns.

632
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:02,340
Waterfront scum was far too common for special
mention; though there was vague talk about

633
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:08,510
one inland trip these mongrels had made, during
which faint drumming and red flame were noted

634
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:14,590
on the distant hills. In Auckland I learned
that Johansen had returned with yellow hair

635
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:20,700
turned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive
questioning at Sydney, and had thereafter

636
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:27,570
sold his cottage in West Street and sailed
with his wife to his old home in Oslo. Of

637
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:32,450
his stirring experience he would tell his
friends no more than he had told the admiralty

638
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:37,950
officials, and all they could do was to give
me his Oslo address.

639
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:43,040
After that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly
with seamen and members of the vice-admiralty

640
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:48,970
court. I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial
use, at Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, but

641
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:54,680
gained nothing from its non-committal bulk.
The crouching image with its cuttlefish head,

642
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:59,790
dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed
pedestal, was preserved in the Museum at Hyde

643
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:06,210
Park; and I studied it long and well, finding
it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship,

644
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:12,650
and with the same utter mystery, terrible
antiquity, and unearthly strangeness of material

645
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:18,810
which I had noted in Legrasse’s smaller
specimen. Geologists, the curator told me,

646
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:24,870
had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they
vowed that the world held no rock like it.

647
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:29,570
Then I thought with a shudder of what Old
Castro had told Legrasse about the Old Ones;

648
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:36,420
“They had come from the stars, and had brought
Their images with Them.”

649
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:40,020
Shaken with such a mental revolution as I
had never before known, I now resolved to

650
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:46,780
visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London,
I reembarked at once for the Norwegian capital;

651
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:52,640
and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves
in the shadow of the Egeberg. Johansen’s

652
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:58,370
address, I discovered, lay in the Old Town
of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive

653
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:03,490
the name of Oslo during all the centuries
that the greater city masqueraded as “Christiana.”

654
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:09,480
I made the brief trip by taxicab, and knocked
with palpitant heart at the door of a neat

655
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:16,090
and ancient building with plastered front.
A sad-faced woman in black answered my summons,

656
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:21,180
and I was stung with disappointment when she
told me in halting English that Gustaf Johansen

657
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,480
was no more.

658
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:29,800
He had not long survived his return, said
his wife, for the doings sea in 1925 had broken

659
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:34,880
him. He had told her no more than he told
the public, but had left a long manuscript

660
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:40,700
- of “technical matters” as he said - written
in English, evidently in order to guard her

661
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:48,190
from the peril of casual perusal. During a
walk through a narrow lane near the Gothenburg

662
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:54,710
dock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic
window had knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors

663
01:07:54,710 --> 01:08:02,760
at once helped him to his feet, but before
the ambulance could reach him he was dead.

664
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:08,490
Physicians found no adequate cause the end,
and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened

665
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:15,230
constitution. I now felt gnawing at my vitals
that dark terror which will never leave me

666
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:22,739
till I, too, am at rest; “accidentally”
or otherwise. Persuading the widow that my

667
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:26,839
connexion with her husband’s “technical
matters” was sufficient to entitle me to

668
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:32,279
his manuscript, I bore the document away and
began to read it on the London boat.

669
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:39,429
It was a simple, rambling thing - a naive
sailor’s effort at a post-facto diary - and

670
01:08:39,429 --> 01:08:46,569
strove to recall day by day that last awful
voyage. I cannot attempt to transcribe it

671
01:08:46,569 --> 01:08:53,029
verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance,
but I will tell its gist enough to shew why

672
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:58,650
the sound the water against the vessel’s
sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped

673
01:08:58,650 --> 01:09:00,889
my ears with cotton.

674
01:09:00,889 --> 01:09:07,960
Johansen, thank God, did not know quite all,
even though he saw the city and the Thing,

675
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:12,619
but I shall never sleep calmly again when
I think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly

676
01:09:12,619 --> 01:09:18,769
behind life in time and in space, and of those
unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which

677
01:09:18,769 --> 01:09:24,000
dream beneath the sea, known and favoured
by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose

678
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,710
them upon the world whenever another earthquake
shall heave their monstrous stone city again

679
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:31,690
to the sun and air.

680
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:38,970
Johansen’s voyage had begun just as he told
it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma, in ballast,

681
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:43,920
had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and
had felt the full force of that earthquake-born

682
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,859
tempest which must have heaved up from the
sea-bottom the horrors that filled men’s

683
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:55,030
dreams. Once more under control, the ship
was making good progress when held up by the

684
01:09:55,030 --> 01:10:00,320
Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the
mate’s regret as he wrote of her bombardment

685
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:07,409
and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends on
the Alert he speaks with significant horror.

686
01:10:07,409 --> 01:10:12,019
There was some peculiarly abominable quality
about them which made their destruction seem

687
01:10:12,019 --> 01:10:17,860
almost a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous
wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought

688
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:23,409
against his party during the proceedings of
the court of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by

689
01:10:23,409 --> 01:10:29,550
curiosity in their captured yacht under Johansen’s
command, the men sight a great stone pillar

690
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:37,369
sticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude
47�9’, W. Longitude l23�43’, come

691
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:43,840
upon a coastline of mingled mud, ooze, and
weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing

692
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:49,320
less than the tangible substance of earth’s
supreme terror - the nightmare corpse-city

693
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:54,921
of R’lyeh, that was built in measureless
aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome

694
01:10:54,921 --> 01:11:01,440
shapes that seeped down from the dark stars.
There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden

695
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:07,989
in green slimy vaults and sending out at last,
after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that

696
01:11:07,989 --> 01:11:12,639
spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive
and called imperiously to the faithfull to

697
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:18,739
come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration.
All this Johansen did not suspect, but God

698
01:11:18,739 --> 01:11:21,030
knows he soon saw enough!

699
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:26,699
I suppose that only a single mountain-top,
the hideous monolith-crowned citadel whereon

700
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:32,929
great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged
from the waters. When I think of the extent

701
01:11:32,929 --> 01:11:39,719
of all that may be brooding down there I almost
wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and

702
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:45,059
his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of
this dripping Babylon of elder daemons, and

703
01:11:45,059 --> 01:11:49,699
must have guessed without guidance that it
was nothing of this or of any sane planet.

704
01:11:49,699 --> 01:11:55,750
Awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish
stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the

705
01:11:55,750 --> 01:12:00,949
great carven monolith, and at the stupefying
identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs

706
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:06,280
with the queer image found in the shrine on
the Alert, is poignantly visible in every

707
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,730
line of the mates frightened description.

708
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:14,790
Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen
achieved something very close to it when he

709
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:19,790
spoke of the city; for instead of describing
any definite structure or building, he dwells

710
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:25,929
only on broad impressions of vast angles and
stone surfaces - surfaces too great to belong

711
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:32,360
to anything right or proper for this earth,
and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs.

712
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:37,199
I mention his talk about angles because it
suggests something Wilcox had told me of his

713
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:45,260
awful dreams. He said that the geometry of
the dream-place he saw was abnormal, non-Euclidean,

714
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:51,909
and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions
apart from ours. Now an unlettered seaman

715
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:56,670
felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible
reality.

716
01:12:56,670 --> 01:13:00,960
Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank
on this monstrous Acropolis, and clambered

717
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:07,360
slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which
could have been no mortal staircase. The very

718
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:12,599
sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed
through the polarising miasma welling out

719
01:13:12,599 --> 01:13:18,380
from this sea-soaked perversion, and twisted
menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those

720
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:24,739
crazily elusive angles of carven rock where
a second glance shewed concavity after the

721
01:13:24,739 --> 01:13:27,840
first shewed convexity.

722
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,420
Something very like fright had come over all
the explorers before anything more definite

723
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:39,480
than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each
would have fled had he not feared the scorn

724
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:44,239
of the others, and it was only half-heartedly
that they searched - vainly, as it proved

725
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:49,480
- for some portable souvenir to bear away.

726
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:54,369
It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed
up the foot of the monolith and shouted of

727
01:13:54,369 --> 01:13:59,369
what he had found. The rest followed him,
and looked curiously at the immense carved

728
01:13:59,369 --> 01:14:08,550
door with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief.
It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door;

729
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:13,010
and they all felt that it was a door because
of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs

730
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:17,880
around it, though they could not decide whether
it lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise

731
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:23,920
like an outside cellar-door. As Wilcox would
have said, the geometry of the place was all

732
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:29,610
wrong. One could not be sure that the sea
and the ground were horizontal, hence the

733
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:34,989
relative position of everything else seemed
phantasmally variable.

734
01:14:34,989 --> 01:14:40,050
Briden pushed at the stone in several places
without result. Then Donovan felt over it

735
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:46,320
delicately around the edge, pressing each
point separately as he went. He climbed interminably

736
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,280
along the grotesque stone moulding - that
is, one would call it climbing if the thing

737
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:55,719
was not after all horizontal - and the men
wondered how any door in the universe could

738
01:14:55,719 --> 01:15:04,639
be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly,
the acre-great lintel began to give inward

739
01:15:04,639 --> 01:15:09,219
at the top; and they saw that it was balanced.

740
01:15:09,219 --> 01:15:14,750
Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself
down or along the jamb and rejoined his fellows,

741
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:21,409
and everyone watched the queer recession of
the monstrously carven portal. In this phantasy

742
01:15:21,409 --> 01:15:27,150
of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously
in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of

743
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:30,230
matter and perspective seemed upset.

744
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:36,190
The aperture was black with a darkness almost
material. That tenebrousness was indeed a

745
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:41,440
positive quality ; for it obscured such parts
of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed,

746
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:46,510
and actually burst forth like smoke from its
aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening

747
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:53,829
the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken
and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings.

748
01:15:53,829 --> 01:15:59,650
The odour rising from the newly opened depths
was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared

749
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:06,630
Hawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping
sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone

750
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:13,579
was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly
into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous

751
01:16:13,579 --> 01:16:19,310
green immensity through the black doorway
into the tainted outside air of that poison

752
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:21,090
city of madness.

753
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:26,600
Poor Johansen’s handwriting almost gave
out when he wrote of this. Of the six men

754
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:31,530
who never reached the ship, he thinks two
perished of pure fright in that accursed instant.

755
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:39,050
The Thing cannot be described - there is no
language for such abysms of shrieking and

756
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:45,840
immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions
of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A

757
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:52,690
mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder
that across the earth a great architect went

758
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:58,519
mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that
telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols,

759
01:16:58,519 --> 01:17:06,070
the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had
awaked to claim his own. The stars were right

760
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:11,530
again, and what an age-old cult had failed
to do by design, a band of innocent sailors

761
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:18,730
had done by accident. After vigintillions
of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and

762
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:21,730
ravening for delight.

763
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:26,570
Three men were swept up by the flabby claws
before anybody turned. God rest them, if there

764
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:33,080
be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan,
Guerrera, and Angstrom. Parker slipped as

765
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:37,300
the other three were plunging frenziedly over
endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the

766
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:42,170
boat, and Johansen swears he was swallowed
up by an angle of masonry which shouldn’t

767
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:47,120
have been there; an angle which was acute,
but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only

768
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:52,190
Briden and Johansen reached the boat, and
pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous

769
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:57,480
monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones
and hesitated, floundering at the edge of

770
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:00,120
the water.

771
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:04,720
Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely,
despite the departure of all hands for the

772
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:09,300
shore; and it was the work of only a few moments
of feverish rushing up and down between wheel

773
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:16,789
and engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly,
amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable

774
01:18:16,789 --> 01:18:22,389
scene, she began to churn the lethal waters;
whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore

775
01:18:22,389 --> 01:18:28,480
that was not of earth the titan Thing from
the stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme

776
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:35,380
cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then,
bolder than the storied Cyclops, great Cthulhu

777
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:42,320
slid greasily into the water and began to
pursue with vast wave-raising strokes of cosmic

778
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:48,750
potency. Briden looked back and went mad,
laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at

779
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:54,159
intervals till death found him one night in
the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.

780
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:59,969
But Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing
that the Thing could surely overtake the Alert

781
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:04,840
until steam was fully up, he resolved on a
desperate chance; and, setting the engine

782
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:11,190
for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck
and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty

783
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:16,130
eddying and foaming in the noisome brine,
and as the steam mounted higher and higher

784
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:22,239
the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head
on against the pursuing jelly which rose above

785
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:29,070
the unclean froth like the stern of a daemon
galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing

786
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:35,210
feelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of
the sturdy yacht, but johansen drove on relentlessly.

787
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:42,139
There was a bursting as of an exploding bladder,
a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish,

788
01:19:42,139 --> 01:19:48,349
a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and
a sound that the chronicler could not put

789
01:19:48,349 --> 01:19:55,670
on paper. For an instant the ship was befouled
by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and

790
01:19:55,670 --> 01:20:01,519
then there was only a venomous seething astern;
where - God in heaven! - the scattered plasticity

791
01:20:01,519 --> 01:20:07,539
of that nameless sky-spawn was nebulously
recombining in its hateful original form,

792
01:20:07,539 --> 01:20:12,830
whilst its distance widened every second as
the Alert gained impetus from its mounting

793
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:14,949
steam.

794
01:20:14,949 --> 01:20:20,270
That was all. After that Johansen only brooded
over the idol in the cabin and attended to

795
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:25,829
a few matters of food for himself and the
laughing maniac by his side. He did not try

796
01:20:25,829 --> 01:20:31,610
to navigate after the first bold flight, for
the reaction had taken something out of his

797
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:38,340
soul. Then came the storm of April 2nd, and
a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness.

798
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:44,110
There is a sense of spectral whirling through
liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides

799
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:49,489
through reeling universes on a comets tail,
and of hysterical plunges from the pit to

800
01:20:49,489 --> 01:20:54,489
the moon and from the moon back again to the
pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus

801
01:20:54,489 --> 01:21:00,980
of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and
the green, bat-winged mocking imps of Tartarus.

802
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:07,880
Out of that dream came rescue-the Vigilant,
the vice-admiralty court, the streets of Dunedin,

803
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:14,170
and the long voyage back home to the old house
by the Egeberg. He could not tell - they would

804
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:22,219
think him mad. He would write of what he knew
before death came, but his wife must not guess.

805
01:21:22,219 --> 01:21:28,929
Death would be a boon if only it could blot
out the memories.

806
01:21:28,929 --> 01:21:34,060
That was the document I read, and now I have
placed it in the tin box beside the bas-relief

807
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:40,940
and the papers of Professor Angell. With it
shall go this record of mine - this test of

808
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:46,139
my own sanity, wherein is pieced together
that which I hope may never be pieced together

809
01:21:46,139 --> 01:21:52,389
again. I have looked upon all that the universe
has to hold of horror, and even the skies

810
01:21:52,389 --> 01:21:58,940
of spring and the flowers of summer must ever
afterward be poison to me. But I do not think

811
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:08,650
my life will be long. As my uncle went, as
poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know

812
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:14,349
too much, and the cult still lives.

813
01:22:14,349 --> 01:22:19,780
Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again
in that chasm of stone which has shielded

814
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:25,429
him since the sun was young. His accursed
city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant

815
01:22:25,429 --> 01:22:30,889
sailed over the spot after the April storm;
but his ministers on earth still bellow and

816
01:22:30,889 --> 01:22:38,030
prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths
in lonely places. He must have been trapped

817
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:43,920
by the sinking whilst within his black abyss,
or else the world would by now be screaming

818
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:52,060
with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end?
What has risen may sink, and what has sunk

819
01:22:52,060 --> 01:23:00,100
may rise. Loathsomeness waits and dreams in
the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering

820
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:09,030
cities of men. A time will come - but I must
not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if

821
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:15,120
I do not survive this manuscript, my executors
may put caution before audacity and see that

822
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:27,449
it meets no other eye.
