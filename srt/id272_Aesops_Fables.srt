00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,480
"Look at me!" said the Hare to the other animals.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,080
"Just look how fast I can run."

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,240
The Hare ran across a field as fast as he could.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,720
All the animals agreed that yes the Hare was very fast.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,680
The Hare ran back.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,720
"See," he shouted.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
"I'm not even out of breath."

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,800
"Yeah, that was fast," said a Fox.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,560
"So who wants a race?" said the Hare.

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,480
"Anybody think they could beat me?"

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,800
None of the animals spoke.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,160
"See," said the Hare.

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,880
"You're all too scared to even try."

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,880
"I'll have a go," said the Tortoise.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,200
The Hare laughed.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,960
"You? The slowest creature in the whole world? I'm not
wasting my time racing a Tortoise."

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,120
"What's the matter?" said the Tortoise.

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,800
"Scared I might beat you?"

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:17,760
Some of the animals laughed at that so the Hare said, "Alright then, Tortoise. Let's have a race...right
now...then we'll see who's laughing."

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,000
"Not today," said the Tortoise.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,200
"We'll race next week. Got to do a bit of training first."

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,600
Next morning the animals watched the Tortoise do his
"training".

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:41,320
First he did some gentle stretching exercises to warm
himself up... and then he started to run.

25
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,360
"Has he started running yet?" asked the Fox.

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,720
"Hard to tell with Tortoises," said the Badger.

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,520
"He's definitely moving."

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,960
"Is he?" said the Fox.

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,280
"Tortoise, are you sure about this?" said the Crow.

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,680
"I mean the Hare IS very fast and you…well…"

31
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,440
"Don't worry," said the Tortoise.

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,800
"This is just day one. I'll speed up. You'll see."

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,920
On the day of the race crowds of animals came to watch.

34
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,640
The Tortoise slowly made his way to the starting line and
then suddenly...

35
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:33,760
...the Hare arrived at top speed wearing a brand-new track
suit and four expensive-looking trainers.

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,520
"The race starts here," said the Fox pointing to a line on
the ground.

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,840
"And ends at that tree on the other side of the field. First
one to touch the tree is the winner."

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,840
"Right, let's get on with it," said the Hare.

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,360
"Ready Tortoise? Ready to see some real speed?"

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,000
"I'm ready," said the Tortoise.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,600
"Ready, steady...go!" said the Fox and the race began.

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,240
The Hare roared off then stopped and looked back.

43
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,200
The Tortoise was still crossing the starting line.

44
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,240
The Hare ran back to the Tortoise.

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:26,560
"Didn't you hear him say go? You can start, you know."

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,480
"I have started," said the Tortoise.

47
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,720
"Look," said the Hare.

48
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:41,920
"You're going so slowly I'm going to have a rest. Might even
have a little sleep. I'll finish the race when I wake up and still beat you by miles."

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,800
The Hare lay down in the sun and fell asleep.

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,680
The Tortoise kept going.

51
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:59,400
Slowly, steadily he moved across the field and by evening
time he was getting close to the finishing tree.

52
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,160
Still the Hare slept on and now the animals started to get
excited.

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,720
"You know what? I think he might win," said a Rabbit.

54
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,200
"I can't believe it," said the Badger.

55
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,520
"The Tortoise might actually win."

56
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:24,400
The animals started to get excited and as the Tortoise got
close to the finishing tree they started to cheer.

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,280
"Come on Tortoise," they shouted.

58
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,160
"Nearly there. Keep going old friend. Keep going."

59
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,520
But the noise of the cheering crowd woke up the Hare.

60
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:45,800
He looked across the field, saw the Tortoise about to reach
the tree and in a flash he was running.

61
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:54,640
The Tortoise heard the Hare thundering up behind him but he
kept going...and going...and suddenly he was there.

62
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,880
Just in time the Tortoise touched the tree with his nose.

63
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
He'd done it.

64
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,480
The Tortoise had beaten the Hare fair and square.

65
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,240
"There you go," said the Badger.

66
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,120
"Slow and steady's sometimes better than fast and flashy."

67
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,600
"Not fair," said the Hare.

68
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,160
"I was asleep. We have to run the race again. It's not
fair."

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,520
But no-one was listening to the Hare.

70
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,640
THE FROGS AND THE OX

71
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:50,640
"Mum! Mum! Come quickly!" called the little frog, hopping
and skipping with excitement...

72
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,360
"Come and see the monster!" He called.

73
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:07,400
"It's got two big spikes sticking out of its head and a
funny brush thing at the other end and it goes "OARRR AGH!"

74
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,120
And it kicks frogs."

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,640
"Not now dear," said the little frog's mother.

76
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,200
"Come on mum! Please!"

77
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,800
Mother frog looked more closely at the little one.

78
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,080
"You're Stanley, aren't you?"

79
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,560
"No mum, I'm Zebadee."

80
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,920
"Are you really? You all look so alike."

81
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:41,320
She had 247 children, and it is hard to remember that many names, so she called everyone Stanley to give her memory a
rest.

82
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,000
"Mu-ummm…" cried Zebedee,

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,040
"I haven't finished breakfast, dear."

84
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,840
The little frog hesitated.

85
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,880
"Can I have some then?"

86
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,960
"No, Stanley," she said.

87
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:04,280
"You're not a tadpole any more. Go and find your own slugs -
and stop jiggling about, you're giving me a headache."

88
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,280
"I'm not jiggling about, I'm hopping about."

89
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:19,360
"Well stop it. It looks like exercise, and I can't be having with that sort of thing. How would it be if I were to flip
and flop about like you, doing exercise?"

90
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,240
The little frog thought about it.

91
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,480
"You wouldn't be so podgy," he said.

92
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,160
"Exactly!" said his mother.

93
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:37,160
"You don't get a jelly-belly like mine by exercising. I get all the exercise I need chewing. Now, what's all the fuss
about?"

94
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,840
"It's an Ox! And it's really gross and his shoes have split
down the middle."

95
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,080
"There are no such things as monsters, Stanley, and no
creature in the pond is bigger than me."

96
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,560
"But it is bigger than you, mum. Lot's bigger. I promise."

97
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,560
"Right!" said his mum.

98
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:05,960
"We'll see about that! I'll go with you, and if you are
telling fibs you'll have no worms for a week."

99
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,880
The damp hollow she sat in was home to a good assortment of
slugs.

100
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,080
But she had eaten too many of them.

101
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,880
The big jelly-belly she was so proud of made it difficult to
get about.

102
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,000
Now she could only half-hop, and flop, and then stop.

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,880
Hop, flop and stop, until she was all tired out and could go
no further.

104
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,320
"Stop, Stanley!"

105
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,280
"You've only moved half a metre, mum."

106
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,320
"Far enough," she wheezed.

107
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,880
She took a deep breath – and then she took a deep breath –
and then she took a deep breath.

108
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,480
"Is the ox as big as this?" she asked.

109
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,120
She sounded odd, because it's hard to speak, blown up like a
beach ball.

110
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,600
"Much bigger than that," said the little frog.

111
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,240
So she sucked in more air, and sucked in more air, and
sucked in more air.

112
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,520
"No, mum – it's still bigger…"

113
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:21,840
So she took in another breath, and …and…she shot into the air like an escaped balloon that zips around the room making
rude noises because you let go of the end.

114
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:35,560
"YAAAAAH!" she yelled, looping-the-loop and fizzing off in all directions before crashing - with a spectacular splash -
right in front of the ox!

115
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,760
The ox looked bored with the whole thing.

116
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,200
Water dribbled from his mouth.

117
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,480
"Stanley!" she called back to the little frog a field and a
half away.

118
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,840
"Let that be a lesson to you!"

119
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,520
But the lesson was hers really.

120
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:59,320
THE FOX AND THE CROW

121
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:19,240
"One morning a Fox was walking through the woods looking for something tasty to eat for his breakfast when his nose
picked up a scent - a scent of something very interesting. He stood still and sniffed the air."

122
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,480
"Cheese," he said.

123
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:32,000
"I smell cheese. Now why would there be cheese in the middle
of a wood like this?"

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:44,920
"The Fox didn't have to wait long to find out because there sitting on a branch high up in a tree sat a crow and in the
crow's beak was the biggest piece of cheese he'd ever seen."

125
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:55,400
"Now the Fox loved cheese more than anything in the whole world and he decided that come what may he would have that
piece of cheese for himself."

126
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,400
"Morning Mr Crow," he said.

127
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,120
"Why don't you come down and have a little chat."

128
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,720
"The Crow didn't reply. He just sat on his branch and looked
down at the Fox."

129
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,600
"He must think I'm stupid," thought the Crow to himself.

130
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:30,800
"That fox is after my cheese. If I fly down there he'll jump on me and gobble me up first and then the cheese. Foxes
can't climb trees so I'll just sit up here and enjoy my piece of cheese."

131
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,480
"The Crow was just about to swallow his lump of cheese when
the Fox said."

132
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:52,920
"That cheese looks a bit mouldy to me. I wouldn't eat it if I were you. Mouldy cheese is very very dangerous. You could
easily get ill from bad cheese. If I were you I'd be on the safe side and just drop that cheese right now."

133
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,080
"Oh no," thought the Crow.

134
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:04,760
"I'm not falling for that. There's nothing wrong with this cheese. I found it fresh this morning. It smells wonderful
and I'm going to eat it right now."

135
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,960
"The Crow looked straight at the Fox and waggled his piece
of cheese as if to say "Look what I've got!

136
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,880
Aren't I the lucky one!""

137
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,800
"Right," thought the Fox.

138
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,840
"This Crow isn't quite as stupid as he looks. I'm going to
have to try something else."

139
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:28,760
"You know, Mr Crow," said the Fox, "you really do have the
most lovely feathers."

140
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:38,400
"The Crow smiled to himself. He was rather proud of his sleek black feathers. The Fox was right. They were rather
lovely."

141
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,840
"And your head," said the Fox.

142
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:49,040
"Your head is very fine indeed. Makes you look fierce...but
wise at the same time."

143
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,280
"Right again," thought the Crow.

144
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:58,680
"That Fox knows what he's talking about because I do look
fierce... and I am very very wise."

145
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,360
"And I bet you've got the most beautiful singing voice too,"
said the Fox.

146
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:10,320
"I can tell just by looking at you. I mean all crows are
good singers..."

147
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,240
"The Crow nodded."

148
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,600
"And I bet you're the best singer out of all the crows."

149
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,400
"The Crow nodded again."

150
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:32,800
"See, I can tell you're a great singer just by looking at you. Oh how I'd love to hear you sing. Just once. That's all
I ask. Just one little song would make me so happy."

151
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,200
"The Crow's mind was racing as the Fox started to walk
away."

152
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,600
"Oh well I see I'm not in luck today," sighed the Fox.

153
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:49,840
"Suppose I'll just have to go and listen to a boring old sky
lark...or nightingale..."

154
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,000
"The crow thought to himself. "The Fox is right.

155
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,680
I'm a wonderful singer.

156
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:02,000
Much better than those boring nightingales...and
larks...very over-rated...

157
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,520
I shall sing.

158
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,080
I shall sing for the Fox right now.""

159
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,840
"As the crow opened his beak and started to sing...the piece
of cheese fell to the ground."

160
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,600
"The Fox licked his lips. "Thank you Mr Crow," he said. "You
can stop singing now.

161
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,960
That horrible sound's spoiling my breakfast.""

162
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,680
"But you said you loved to hear a crow sing."

163
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:48,080
"Never believe what people tell you when they're trying to steal your cheese," said the Fox...and he winked at the crow
as he gobbled up the last little bit.

164
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,240
THE MONKEY AS KING

165
00:14:50,240 --> 00:15:02,280
"There was a huge competition in the Indian jungle – and the
prize was – "To be King of the Beasts!"

166
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,880
It was very exciting!

167
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:12,920
To be King of all the Beasts was a grand thing – when you were King you got to wear a shiny crown and all the animals
had to call you "Sire".

168
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,800
Of course, lots of animals entered the competition.

169
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,320
Each animal got to say their piece on a big stage while the
other animals judged."

170
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:41,520
"The first up on stage was Fox. Fox was a very clever animal. He spoke very well about the rights of the people
and the duties of the King; but he used such long words like "fiscal" and "jurisdiction" that most of the animals got bored and fell asleep."

171
00:15:41,520 --> 00:16:03,960
"And," said Fox, "never forget that there are many new traps
around in the jungle. Traps laid by Man to catch animals! Of course, there never was a trap made that could catch a fox. So this is my promise to you. If I am made King, I will educate each and every animal in avoiding these traps. Thank you."

172
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,120
"Fox went off the stage and was met by Monkey."

173
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,680
"Oooh-ooh-ooh! That was a fine and educated speech you just
made!" said Monkey."

174
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,120
"Well, thank you Monkey," replied Fox, pleased."

175
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,000
"Yes – very clever you are," Monkey carried on.

176
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,920
"But that is not what the animals want in a king. Watch
this!"

177
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,840
"And he bounded on to the stage."

178
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,520
"Thank you! Thank you!" he shouted.

179
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:43,200
"It's great to be here! You know - that Fox is a clever fellow. But – poor Fox - he's got no nose. How does he
smell, I hear you ask? He smells...AWFUL!"

180
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,320
"Oooh-ooh-ooh! Do you want to see me dance?" cried Monkey."

181
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,840
"YEH!" roared the audience."

182
00:16:51,840 --> 00:17:00,280
"And monkey danced. He frolicked and he pranced and he
capered and he danced! And what faces he pulled!"

183
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:09,440
"Monkey was funny. The audience laughed and roared and held their sides. And that is how Monkey became King of the
Beasts."

184
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:16,200
"Oooh-ooh-ooh! Well, Fox!" he smirked, as he paraded up and
down in his gold crown.

185
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,240
"Funny beats clever!"

186
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
"PA!" said Fox, angrily.

187
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,880
"We'll see about that!"

188
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,200
"The next day, Fox saw Monkey lolling around in his throne
with his golden crown upon his head."

189
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,040
"No hard feelings…Sire," he said.

190
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,560
"You won, fair and square. And I want to give you a present
fit for a clever king."

191
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,760
"Oooh-ooh-ooh!" said Monkey.

192
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,480
"Being King is boring work! Where's your present?"

193
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,400
"It's a little way into the forest. Come with me!"

194
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,840
"So Monkey and Fox set off into the forest together."

195
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,960
"Oooh-ooh-ooh! Where is it? Where is it?" said Monkey,
getting excited."

196
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:04,440
"There it is, Sire," said sly Fox, pointing at a big, ripe
banana on the jungle floor."

197
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:11,520
"YUM YUM!" cried Monkey, and dived off to pick it up."

198
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,960
"Later that day, the animals were running around in
confusion."

199
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,160
"Where's the King?" they cried.

200
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,280
"Has anyone seen the King?"

201
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,520
"At last they found him. He was sitting – in a TRAP!"

202
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,640
"Monkey held out his arms through the bars. "Oooh-ooh-ooh!

203
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,040
When I went to pick up a banana – this trap fell over me!

204
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,760
Please get me out!""

205
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,200
"But none of the animals knew anything about traps - except
for Fox."

206
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,960
"Fox sat down and curled his long red tail around him."

207
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,360
"Fox! Fox!" cried Monkey.

208
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,680
"Please help me!"

209
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,320
"The Fox turned to look at the animals."

210
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,560
"Should a King be clever?" asked Fox"

211
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,320
"Yes!" the animals cried."

212
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,520
"Does an animal that is clever fall in to a trap?" asked
Fox."

213
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,760
"The animals were silent. They looked at Monkey."

214
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,760
"You are a very foolish monkey," said Fox.

215
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:28,240
"I will get you out of the trap, but you must give up your crown. The King of the Beasts should be an animal that is
smarter than to fall into traps. Don't you think?"

216
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,280
"And all the other animals agreed."

217
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,760
THE BUNDLE OF STICKS

218
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:57,920
"Mrs Mckenzie had six strong sons. They were Peter, Paul and
Patrick, Philip, Frankie and Fred. The only trouble was they couldn't stop arguing with each other!"

219
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:10,040
"When Mrs Mckenzie wanted a well dug – do you think six strong sons could do that? "We'll dig a hole here!" said
Peter. "No – over here!" said Patrick."

220
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:22,040
"And each of the six strong sons grabbed a spade and started digging different holes in different parts of the garden!
"That's no use at all," she sighed."

221
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:42,720
"Mrs Mckenzie asked her six strong sons to row her across the river to see her friend. "We'll do it!" cried Peter and
Paul. They leapt into the boat and sat down facing the front and picked up oars. "No we will!" shouted Patrick and Philip. And they sat down facing backwards and picked up the

222
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,560
oars."

223
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:59,880
"And though they pulled at the oars until the sweat dripped off them – they were rowing the boat in opposite directions
and the boat went absolutely nowhere! "Oh that's no use at all," she sighed."

224
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:13,440
"One day there was a notice in the paper. "Grand Competition to build the biggest barn in the county!" it read. "£600
prize!"

225
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,280
"I'll win that!" said Peter.

226
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,800
"No I'll win it!" said Paul.

227
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:26,400
Patrick, Philip, Frankie and Fred all disagreed…and they all
fell to arguing."

228
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:52,480
"Suddenly, Mrs Mckenzie jumped to her feet. "Quiet!" she said. Then she climbed up on her chair. "Quiet!" she
shouted. Then she climbed up right on top of the table. "WILL YOU BE QUIET!" she roared. Six sons went very, very quiet. They looked up at their mother in astonishment."

229
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,840
"That's better," Mrs Mckenzie said.

230
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:06,200
"Now, you! Fetch me one of those big bundles of sticks that
we keep for the fire." "Yes Mum!" said Peter."

231
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:23,440
"He ran out the door and came back with sticks tied together in abundle as fat as your arm. "Here you are Mum," he
panted. Mrs Mckenzie folded her arms. "Now, my fine strong son, break that bundle in two!""

232
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:42,680
"Peter smirked at his brothers. "Easy!" he boasted, and he took the bundle in both hands. He bent the bundle and he
bowed the bundle but he could not break the bundle. "Well?" said Mrs Mckenzie, tapping her foot."

233
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,280
"Peter hung his head in shame. "I can't do it!"

234
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,360
"Pass the bundle to Paul," said Mrs Mckenzie.

235
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,240
"Ha, ha, ha! Watch this, ha, ha!" sneered Paul.

236
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:02,840
He bent the bundle and he bowed the bundle but he could not
break the bundle.

237
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,880
And neither could Patrick, Philip, Frankie or Fred."

238
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,200
"Give it to me!" said Mrs Mckenzie.

239
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,640
She took the bundle of sticks and untied the string."

240
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:28,640
"She gave one stick to each of her sons. "Can you break that?" she asked. CRACK! Went the sticks as the six strong
sons easily broke them."

241
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,320
"And what have you broken?" asked Mrs Mckenzie.

242
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:39,480
"Er...a stick?" asked Peter, looking down at his hands."

243
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,480
"Yes," Mrs Mckenzie nodded.

244
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:51,880
"But between you, you have broken the bundle of sticks." The
six strong sons looked at each other."

245
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:59,520
"One of you wasn't strong enough," explained Mrs Mckenzie,
"but when you all worked together…"

246
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,680
"We were much stronger!" cried Peter, Paul, Patrick, Philip,
Frankie and Fred."

247
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,120
"And so they were."

248
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:34,080
"And do you know that when they went to the competition, the
six strong sons of Mrs Mckenzie all worked together to build the biggest barn in the county and they won that prize money. All together."

249
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,720
THE GNAT AND THE LION

250
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,840
"Far, far away in a hot land called Africa, lived a Gnat and
a Lion."

251
00:24:43,880 --> 00:25:04,040
"These two creatures were complete opposites. One was weak and one was strong. One was huge and one was tiny. One was
fierce and one was timid. They met one dark night, and this is what happened."

252
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:14,680
"The Gnat had gone to sleep. He had made himself a swinging
hammock on a blade of grass and he was snoring gently."

253
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:22,520
"The Lion was awake. He was hunting - and his roar could be
heard in the distance."

254
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,120
"It woke the Gnat."

255
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,360
"What is that?" he asked."

256
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,680
"The Lion roared again. The sound was even louder."

257
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,720
"It's getting closer," thought the Gnat, holding his
breath."

258
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,480
"A minute later the Lion came into view."

259
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,240
"When the Gnat saw who it was he felt relieved."

260
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,800
"Oh!" he said.

261
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,920
"It's only you."

262
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,480
"This annoyed the Lion."

263
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,640
"Only me!" he murmured silkily, narrowing his yellow eyes.

264
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,840
Are you aware I am the King of the Beasts."

265
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:14,240
"When Lions narrow their eyes and murmur silkily, they are
at their most dangerous. But the Gnat wasn't worried."

266
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,400
"He opened his tiny mouth and yawned."

267
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,040
"You may be the King of the Beasts," he said, "but I can
outwit you anytime."

268
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,880
"The Lion snorted."

269
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,600
"Ha!" he said.

270
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:32,280
"I could flatten you with one swipe of my paw."

271
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,200
"The Gnat stood up on his spindly legs."

272
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,000
"Go on then," he said."

273
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,600
"The lion raised his paw above his head and brought it down
as hard as he could."

274
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,160
"The Gnat jumped out of the way."

275
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,320
"Missed," he said."

276
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,400
"Humming a little tune he began buzzing round the Lions
head."

277
00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:00,000
"Zzzz, Zzzz, Zzzz, Diddly, Diddly, Dee. Zzzz, Zzzz, Zzzz,
Try And Catch Me."

278
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:10,640
"The Lion was furious. He twisted his head this way and that. He snapped, he snarled, he swirled his tail, he swiped
with his paws."

279
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,600
"But the Gnat was too nimble."

280
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,880
"A thought came into the Lion's head."

281
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:25,000
"If I keep perfectly still, the Gnat will settle down, and I
can pounce."

282
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,720
"But the Gnat didn't settle down. He acted quickly."

283
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,680
"He flew straight up the lions nose!"

284
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,240
"And began to bite."

285
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:42,040
"Roaring with pain the Lion shook his head. He stuffed his
claws up his nose."

286
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,840
"The Gnat pulled the hairs inside the Lion's nostrils."

287
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,040
"Make me the King of the Beasts," he called."

288
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,000
"Never," roared the Lion."

289
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,040
"The Gnat bit him again. The Lion's nose began to swell. He
could hardly breath."

290
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,440
"Say it," said the Gnat.

291
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,160
"Say - The Gnat is the King of the Beasts."

292
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,840
"The Lion could bear it no longer."

293
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:17,320
"The Gnat is King of the beasts," he muttered."

294
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:30,440
"His face hurt. His nose was running. His eyes were watering. Without saying another word the once proud Lion
turned and disappeared into the long grass."

295
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,120
"The Gnat was full of glee."

296
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,440
"I am the smartest creature that ever lived," he boasted."

297
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,800
"He began looking for a new place to make his home. He
wanted something soft and comfortable."

298
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:51,760
"Ahead, draped over a bush was what looked like a white,
lacy shawl."

299
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,880
"That's perfect," said the Gnat.

300
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,440
And he wrapped himself in it."

301
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:10,640
"At first, the Gnat didn't notice a small creature moving swiftly towards him, climbing delicately over the lacy
threads. When he did, it was too late."

302
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,320
"Hello, Gnat," said the Spider."

303
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,200
"The Gnat tried to fly away, but he was stuck."

304
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,200
"You can't harm me," he said, "I'm the new King of the
Beasts."

305
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,840
"We'll see about that," said the Spider."

306
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,080
"And he ate the Gnat for his supper."

307
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,720
THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN

308
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:58,080
"It was a fine but very cold winter's day as the Sun shone
down on the snow-covered earth below."

309
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,640
"What a beautiful sight," it thought.

310
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:13,800
"And look at the little white sails of the ships on the blue
sea. I want to take my time travelling across the sky today. After all, what's the rush?"

311
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:22,000
"Suddenly, a freezing cold blast of air screeched past – and
nearly blew the Sun along with it."

312
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,760
"Out of my way, Sun," roared the Wind.

313
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,080
"See those ships? I'm going to blow them right off course.
They won't know what's hit them…"

314
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:48,840
"The Wind blew and blew – it blew so hard that the ship's sails ripped apart. All the Sun could do was watch as the
sailors shivered in the icy blast, shook their fists and cried out in anger."

315
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,280
"Not again, Wind," sighed the Sun.

316
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,920
"Why do you have to cause misery and chaos all the time?"

317
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,960
"Because I like showing just how strong I am," replied the
Wind.

318
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:10,880
"You sit in the sky and do nothing except shine, but I am
full of force and energy."

319
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,800
"Hmmm…" said the Sun, looking thoughtful.

320
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:20,000
"I have an idea. Let's have a contest to see which of us is
the stronger."

321
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,480
"I know who will win," said the Wind.

322
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,120
"We shall see," replied the Sun.

323
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,000
"Do you see that man down there?"

324
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:42,760
"The Wind looked where the Sun was pointing. A young man was walking along a windy road through the mountains. It was so
cold, he was wearing a heavy winter coat to keep warm."

325
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:49,120
"Let's see which one of us is strong enough to take his coat
off him," suggested the Sun."

326
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,320
"Easy, I can do that in no time," boasted the Wind.

327
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,800
"Go on then," said the Sun.

328
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:03,000
I'll watch you from behind a cloud."

329
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:12,280
"The Wind blew and blew. It blew so hard that the birds had
to cling to the trees to stop being swept away."

330
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:25,960
"The man shivered and did up the top button of his coat as the snow swirled in the air. The Wind kept on blowing – but
the more it did so, the tighter the man pulled his coat around him to keep warm."

331
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,320
"I give up," gasped the Wind at last.

332
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
"I've got no more puff left."

333
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,520
"Now it's my turn," said the Sun as it emerged from the
cloud."

334
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:47,160
"The Sun gently breathed in the cold air. The stronger it
breathed in, the larger and rounder it seemed to glow."

335
00:32:47,200 --> 00:33:02,720
"On the white earth below the air was becoming warmer. The Wind watched in awe as the snow began to melt. Icicles were
dripping and even the thick ice on the lakes was starting to thaw and crack."

336
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:16,400
"The man looked round in wonder at the melting landscape. It had been such a long, cold winter that it was a joy to feel
the warmth of the Sun on his face. He undid his top button, then a second…"

337
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,920
"What a lovely day it's turning out to be," the man thought.

338
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:34,600
"It's too warm for this heavy winter coat. Everything is so bright and beautiful, I just want to enjoy the Sun and rest
a while – I might even have a little nap."

339
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:47,440
"The Wind was beside itself with annoyance as the man sat under the shade of a large rock and took off his coat. It
was so annoyed it kept making little angry puffs."

340
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:54,440
"Your icy blasts hardened his heart and made him
determination to keep his coat on," said the Sun.

341
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:05,120
"But my glowing rays opened his heart - and his coat
buttons. Look, I've cheered up those poor sailors too."

342
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:18,600
"The sailors on the broken ships were cheering and waving up at the Sun. "Now they can mend their sails – and I shall
carry on shining until their ships can sail again," said the Sun."

343
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:26,120
"Down below on the Earth, the young man looked up at the Sun
as if he had heard him speak."

344
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:38,800
"That Wind – it was strong. But the Sun is stronger still," he murmured to himself, before nodding off for a restful
sleep."

345
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:54,600
THE FOX AND THE GRAPES

346
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:11,960
"One hot day at the end of summer a fox trotted along the dusty path to a farm, listening out for other creatures and
sniffing the air, as foxes do."

347
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:21,400
"It was getting late, and after a long day the sun looked a little red in the face and had dropped out of sight behind a
bush."

348
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:50,320
"It was the time of day that the fox liked best. The farmer's work was finished. He had taken off his muddy boots
and gone inside for tea. The fox only showed himself when the farmer had left his boots outside. Then, if he came running after the fox with his gun - as farmers do - he would first have to sit on the step, put his boots back on again, and the fox would have plenty of time to run away."

349
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:58,880
"The fox is certainly very clever, and handsome too, but no
one knows this better than the fox himself."

350
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:12,520
"He would look at his reflection for hours admiring his beautiful red coat with its snow white bib. He would look at
his smart black legs, which matched his sleek black ears. And his

351
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:19,520
sleek black ears matched his shiny black nose, which looked
exactly like a small polished pebble."

352
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:28,520
"But best of all, he thought, was his glorious bushy tail,
like a big, soft paintbrush dipped in whitewash."

353
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:45,040
"The farmer locked in the hens at night, and the rabbits and geese, and he shooed the ducks onto their little island in
the middle of the duck pond so that the clever fox could not get them. He knew the fox hated swimming."

354
00:36:45,040 --> 00:37:06,880
"But the fox did not only eat chickens and rabbits and ducks and geese, though he would put them all on the menu given
half a chance. If he couldn't get into the hen house, and he couldn't swim to the duck island, and if the geese made a fuss and rattled their beaks at him - as geese do - then there was always something else to eat."

355
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:16,560
"There were slugs and grasshoppers and mice and worms and frogs and eggs and big meaty bones the farmer put out with
the rubbish."

356
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,720
"And tonight there was fruit!"

357
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:24,880
"The fox looked up at a huge bunch of juicy grapes hanging

358
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:33,720
above his head. He was very thirsty. He could imagine the
sweet, delicious juice running down his chin."

359
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:46,960
"But he couldn't reach them. He was clever, though, wasn't he? Everyone said so, and the fox was used to getting what
he wanted – so he would take a run at it, and…jump!"

360
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,480
"Missed!"

361
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:58,960
"He jumped again…And again. He leaped and hopped and bounced and somersaulted. But the juicy grapes were always just out
of reach."

362
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,560
"The fox stopped at last, hot and panting."

363
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,520
"Haaa well!" he said to himself.

364
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:17,960
"The grapes don't look that juicy and I just know they will be as bitter as lemons. Phooey! Who wants to eat sour
grapes!"

365
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:31,240
"And the fox walked slowly along the dusty path back to his den with his nose in the air and his tail between his legs -
as hungry, disappointed foxes do."

366
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:43,120
"Sometimes, when we can't get what we want, we pretend we
never wanted it anyway."

367
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:52,440
THE DOG, THE COCKEREL AND THE FOX

368
00:38:52,440 --> 00:39:01,160
"Dog lived in the farmyard and it was her job to let
everyone know when someone was at the gate."

369
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,160
"And she did her job very well."

370
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,680
"Cockerel lived in the farmyard too and it was his job to
wake everyone up in the morning!"

371
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,800
"He was an excellent alarm clock."

372
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:19,360
"One day Dog said to Cockerel "Let's go for an adventure in
the big wide world.""

373
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:29,720
""I'm not sure that's a good idea," Cockerel replied, "I've heard that there's a fox nearby whose favourite food is
cockerel pie!""

374
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:38,120
""Well if a fox tries to bake you in a pie!" said Dog, "I'll
soon sort him out…GRRRRR GRRRR!""

375
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,560
""In that case, I'll come

376
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,200
with you!" said Cockerel."

377
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
"So off they went."

378
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:55,120
"The big wide world was wide indeed…with sky at the top and hills underneath and a squiggly path that seemed to go on
forever."

379
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:04,040
"The two friends journeyed along the path, then, just as the
sun slipped behind the hills they came to a wood."

380
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:11,360
""It'll be dark soon," said Cockerel. "Let's find a place to
sleep.""

381
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:18,360
""This tree looks perfect," woofed Dog, "it's big and it's
hollow, so I can curl up inside and keep guard!""

382
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,240
""And there's a wide branch where I can roost!" said
Cockerel."

383
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,800
"Dog curled up in the hollow tree and Cockerel roosted on
the branch."

384
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,320
"Suddenly they heard a sound."

385
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,840
""What was that?" said Cockerel."

386
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,480
""Just an owl," woofed Dog."

387
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:46,120
""Oh, thank goodness," said Cockerel, "I thought it was a
fox coming to gobble me up!""

388
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:54,680
""Yes," said Cockerel, "foxes are slinky and sneaky and sly
and their favourite food is cockerel pie!""

389
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:03,680
""I'll protect you!" said Dog, "A fox can't find you on that
branch anyway, not unless you

390
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,360
cock-a-doodle-doo.""

391
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:10,640
""That's true!" said Cockerel. "Goodnight, Dog!""

392
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:17,760
""Goodnight, Cockerel - and remember not to
cock-a-doodle-doo in the morning, or the fox might hear
you!""

393
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,960
"Cockerel slept happily after that."

394
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:32,600
"But in the morning when the sun came up, he thought he was still on the farm. So he let out a loud COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO.
Which woke up Fox."

395
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,840
""Ooops!" clucked Cockerel, "Now I've gone and done it!""

396
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,320
""Good morning, Cockerel," growled Fox."

397
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,160
""Good morning!"

398
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,080
Cockerel replied nervously."

399
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,440
"Fox narrowed his eyes, "I haven't seen you in this wood
before!""

400
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,880
""I only arrived last night," clucked Cockerel nervously."

401
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:06,920
""Why don't you invite me up, it would be rude not to," said
Fox."

402
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:14,480
""I haven't tidied up yet!" said Cockerel, "Pop back
later!""

403
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,880
""I don't mind if your branch is untidy!" said Fox."

404
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:31,680
"Cockerel sighed, "Come on up then," he said slyly. "Go round to the door at the bottom of the tree and my porter
will let you in!""

405
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:46,640
"Fox grinned to himself a sneaky grin…a thread of drool hung from his chin. He went to the hollow in the tree…where Dog
was waiting patiently."

406
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:54,400
""Hey, Mr Fox, you wanted to trick me and gobble me up, but
I tricked you instead!" clucked Cockerel."

407
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,360
"Fox ran off as fast as he could… and he's never been seen
in that part of the wood again."

408
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,880
""That was an adventure!"

409
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,440
Dog yapped."

410
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:14,480
"And home they went to tell the tale of how the Fox's plan
had failed."

411
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:26,480
THE MILLER, HIS SON AND THE DONKEY

412
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:37,760
"Fetch our old donkey," the miller said to his son one day.

413
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,680
"We're taking him to market. We need money and we've nothing
else to sell."

414
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:51,120
"The son ran to the stable where the donkey was kept. He
threw a halter over its neck. And the donkey wasn't
happy!!!"

415
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:56,920
"Grumpy old thing!" said the son, as he led the donkey out
of the stable."

416
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,480
"I'm not sorry we're selling you!"

417
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,280
"I'm not sorry either," brayed the donkey.

418
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,080
"When was the last time you gave me a carrot!"

419
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,840
"We won't ride him," said the miller.

420
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,920
"It'll be easier to sell him if he's not tired."

421
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,680
"They led the donkey down the street towards the town."

422
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,840
"Hey, you," a man shouted suddenly."

423
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,960
"Why don't you ride the donkey?"

424
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,080
"That's what it's for!" another man hollered."

425
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,640
"The crowd began to laugh."

426
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:36,560
"The miller hated to be laughed at. "Get up, son," he said.
The son climbed up on to the donkey's back."

427
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:42,080
"At least it's the smaller one," the donkey grumbled as he
felt the son's weight on his back.

428
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,320
"Something to be grateful for, I suppose."

429
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:52,760
"But they hadn't travelled far before they passed three
merchants, whispering and shaking their heads."

430
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,960
"What is the world coming to?" the miller heard one of them
say.

431
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,480
"Get down, young man. Let your master ride the donkey."

432
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:08,760
"The miller thought he'd better do as they said. "Hop down,
lad, and help me up," he said to his son."

433
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,880
"So the son climbed down and helped his father clamber up."

434
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,880
"Ee-aw!" grumbled the donkey, as the miller landed on his
back.

435
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,080
"What a lump. Worse than a sack of potatoes."

436
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:35,400
"His back was hard and bony. The miller wasn't sorry when they reached the gates of the town. A group of girls were
standing there, bags and baskets in their hands."

437
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:42,720
"The miller pulled on the donkey's halter. "Whoa!" he said.
"Let the ladies through first."

438
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:50,200
"Cor, look at that poor boy," one of the girls said, seeing
the son lead the donkey, his father on top.

439
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,280
"His master should let him ride too."

440
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,040
"Lazy thing."

441
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,880
"The miller was a bit cross, but he liked to please. "Get up
behind me, son," he said."

442
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,600
"What! Both of you at once!" the donkey screeched.

443
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,440
"I'm an old donkey. Ee-aw!"

444
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,800
"Look at that poor creature," a woman said as the donkey
crawled slowly along the road, head drooping.

445
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,920
"Two of them on his back."

446
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,040
"And one of them so big!" said her friend."

447
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,480
"They should be carrying it!"

448
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,320
"Yes, they are right," thought the miller, and climbed down.

449
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:37,480
"Get down, son. We'll carry him between us." They tied the
donkey's legs to a pole, the donkey slung between them."

450
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:46,920
"Now they know what it's like to be a donkey - carrying great loads all day," he thought as the miller and his son
stumbled down the street."

451
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:57,280
"The townspeople had never seen such a sight before. They ran out of their houses to watch. "Don't they look silly",
they laughed."

452
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:04,320
"The donkey hated to be laughed at. He pushed and he pulled,
trying to free himself."

453
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:14,720
"Slowly the ropes that bound him began to loosen. "One –
more – heave," he gasped as they stumbled up to the bridge."

454
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:27,920
"And with a final tug and a kick he was free. Over the bridge he tumbled. Down, down, down he fell. Splash! Into
the river below."

455
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,400
"He thrashed and he brayed."

456
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,160
"But there was nothing he could do."

457
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,440
"Ee-aw. Ee-aw," he cried.

458
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,720
Ee— aw!"

459
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,800
"The miller watched helplessly as his donkey was swept
away."

460
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:53,640
"Silly me," he said as he and his son trudged homewards.

461
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:06,560
"By trying to please everyone I have lost my donkey - and
now I have nothing left to sell."

462
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,360
THE WOLF AND THE HERON

463
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:33,000
"Wolf loved food. He ate breakfast then he ate two more breakfasts, which took him up to his midday snack. This was
followed by three helpings of lunch, tea, dinner, supper and a midnight feast – with barely a burp between them."

464
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,720
"When Wolf went to bed he stared up at the moon and stars
and wondered what they would taste like."

465
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,600
"Absolutely scrumptious," he decided.

466
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:50,480
Then Wolf would fall asleep and dream of all the food he'd
eat next day."

467
00:48:50,480 --> 00:49:12,400
"One morning Wolf found an enormous, glittering fish in the shallow waters at the edge of the river. So, Wolf gobbled up
the fish as quickly as a great woolly cloud gobbles up the moon. Wolf was about to pat his stomach when he realized something was wrong."

468
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:21,200
"Ack eurk ach! There's a bone stuck in my throat!" Wolf spluttered and slapped the back of his neck with his
enormous paws.

469
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:31,280
He coughed, shook his head and waggled his ears but nothing
he did made any difference – the bone was stuck fast."

470
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,760
"I wont be able to eat ever again!" Wolf moaned.

471
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:53,760
"No more food for me - and the bone hurts, it's like having tummy ache and stubbed toes all at once inside my neck!
Please, will someone help me!" and he whined and stumbled frantically along the riverbank.

472
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,960
Then he noticed…"

473
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,120
"Oh – look at that bird!

474
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,040
Look at that beak!" he croaked."

475
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:09,760
"Are you looking at me?" asked a Heron as the Wolf's
whiskers tickled his wing."

476
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:18,440
"Yes," said Wolf and smiled the best smile he'd ever smiled
so that sunlight went "ting" on his teeth.

477
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:31,080
"I was just thinking what a beautiful bird you are and how pointy and useful that beak of yours is. I wonder if you
could help me?"

478
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:36,120
"Go on," said the Heron, "I am rather handsome."

479
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:55,320
"Well, Heron, there's a bone stuck in my throat and it hurts. Worse than that, I can't eat because of it." And
Wolf's stomach rumbled so loudly a nearby family of ducks thought it was thunder and hurried into the rushes.

480
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,760
Wolf lifted up his paw and whined."

481
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:06,120
"Please, wonderful Heron, kind Heron, use your beak to get
it out."

482
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:14,000
"Um, well, to tell you the truth, Wolf, I am having a little
rest right now," said the Heron."

483
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:21,800
"Listen, Heron, my friend, I'll give you a present if you
remove the bone - as a reward."

484
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,080
"Sounds good to me," said the Heron.

485
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:32,040
"I can always have a rest later. Open your mouth as wide as
you can and I'll have a look."

486
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:42,080
"Ahhhh," went the Wolf and in went the Heron's head, sliding
carefully between the rows of sharp teeth."

487
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:49,720
"It was dark in the Wolf's throat but Heron found the bone
and tapped and tweaked and tugged."

488
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:56,200
"Got it!" Heron said, gently drawing out the bone and
setting it down beside the Wolf.

489
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,360
"Now, what about my reward?"

490
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:06,920
"Wolf grinned an unpleasant grin that showed all his teeth.
"See these?"

491
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,880
Wolf said, tapping a tune on them with the tip of a long
pointed claw."

492
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:18,320
"Yes, I had a good look at them a moment ago when my head
was in your mouth," said the trusting Heron."

493
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:25,760
"Well, snarled Wolf, "I didn't bite your head off, did I?"

494
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,160
"Heron checked his neck. "No you didn't," he replied."

495
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:54,240
"Well, that's your reward." And Wolf snapped slinked away to
get his next meal."

496
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,520
THE DONKEY IN THE LION'S SKIN

497
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:01,280
"There was once a foolish donkey who wished he was something
else."

498
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:20,440
"If only I was a giraffe," he would say, "then I could look over the tops of trees...if only I was an elephant then I
could remember where I left things...if only I was a cheetah then I could run like the wind...or fierce as a rhinoceros..."

499
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,240
"...or cunning as a crocodile..."

500
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,480
"...or strong as a hippo."

501
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:33,040
"Anything was better than being a donkey. Everyone laughed
at donkeys and he didn't like it one little bit."

502
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:46,080
"One day, when he was walking through the forest the donkey saw something draped over the branch of a tree. When he got
closer he could see it was a lion costume."

503
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,360
"I'd look good in that," he thought."

504
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,240
"So he put it on."

505
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,680
"It covered him from head to foot."

506
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,440
"The donkey found a pool and looked at his reflection."

507
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,760
"I look magnificent," he said."

508
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,080
"He paraded up and down looking at his reflection from every
angle."

509
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:15,520
"The massive head of the lion covered his donkey's head and
the lion's golden mane flowed round his neck."

510
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:21,240
"I look like a lion and I feel like a lion," he said.

511
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:26,400
"No-one will laugh at me now. I am King of the beasts!"

512
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:44,200
"The donkey couldn't wait to show himself to other animals. He walked up to a giraffe who was eating leaves from the top
of a tall tree. She stopped when she saw the donkey and bent her long legs in a curtsy."

513
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,720
"Your Majesty," she said, in a fearful voice."

514
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:53,400
"Greetings, giraffe," said the donkey in a deep, lion-like
voice.

515
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,320
"Won't you join me in a stroll?"

516
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:02,680
"I can't today," said the giraffe, "I have to get tea for my
children."

517
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,880
"And she ran away as quickly as she could."

518
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,760
"The donkey smiled to himself."

519
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,800
"He saw a hippo in the river."

520
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,400
"The hippo bowed his head when he saw the donkey."

521
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:21,440
"Your Majesty," he said, in hushed tones."

522
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,720
"Greetings hippo," said the donkey.

523
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,240
"Won't you join me in a stroll?"

524
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,880
"I can't today," said the hippo.

525
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,040
"I have to call on a friend who is sick."

526
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,360
"And he sank out of sight."

527
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:40,760
"Inside the lion costume the donkey was grinning all over
his face."

528
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,800
"He tripped over a crocodile sunbathing on a rock."

529
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:51,920
"Your Majesty!" said the crocodile, smiling with his teeth
on the outside of his lips."

530
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,680
"Greetings crocodile," said the donkey.

531
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,360
"Won't you…"

532
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,640
"But the crocodile had slipped into the water and
disappeared."

533
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,320
"The donkey was jubilant."

534
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:17,640
"He wanted to leap up and down with delight. What a marvellous thing it was to be a lion. A lion was admired and
feared by all the other animals. He felt like a king."

535
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:25,200
"Just then a wily fox came into view. When he saw the donkey
he turned to run."

536
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:32,080
"The donkey could contain his delight no longer. "I'm a
lion," he thought. "I look like a lion, I act like a lion.

537
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,480
I feel like a lion.

538
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,720
I BET I EVEN SOUND LIKE A LION.""

539
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,160
"And the foolish donkey lifted his head and roared."

540
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,920
"Hee-Haw, Hee-Haw, Hee-Haw!"

541
00:56:45,920 --> 00:57:04,400
"The fox stopped in his tracks. He knew that sound. He grabbed the lion's mane and pulled. The lion costume came
off in his hands. The donkey stood there, trembling. The fox began to laugh."

542
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,360
"So did the crocodile."

543
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,160
"So did the giraffe."

544
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,120
"And so did the hippo."

545
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:15,400
"If only I had kept my mouth shut," thought the donkey."

546
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,160
"The other animals put their arms round him."

547
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,800
"Don't worry," they said, "we like you just as you are."

548
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:28,680
"And they all hurried away before the real lion came along."

549
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:43,840
THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

550
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:52,840
"One hot summer's day a Grasshopper sat on a blade of grass
enjoying the sunshine."

551
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,880
"What a fine day," he said.

552
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,720
"The sun's shining and I've got as much grass as I can eat."

553
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:05,720
"The Grasshopper spent the whole morning stuffing his face
until he couldn't eat another thing."

554
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,200
"Right," he said.

555
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,120
"Now I'll make some music."

556
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:13,880
"He rubbed his back legs against his wings and made a loud
buzzing sound."

557
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:18,200
"Lovely," said the Grasshopper.

558
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,920
"Nothing better than the sound of a happy Grasshopper."

559
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,320
"Give it a rest," said a passing Ant."

560
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,760
"What?" said the Grasshopper."

561
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,240
"I'm trying to work here," said the Ant.

562
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,960
"You're giving me a headache."

563
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,880
"You don't like my music?" said the Grasshopper."

564
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,400
"Not my kind of thing," said the Ant.

565
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,560
"Anyway ain't got time to stand around talking about music.
Got stuff to do."

566
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,080
"Stuff?" said the Grasshopper.

567
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,920
"What stuff have you got to do on a lovely sunny morning
like this?"

568
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,680
"Gotta get this food shifted," said the Ant."

569
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:59,120
"The Grasshopper noticed that the Ant was dragging along a
huge ear of corn."

570
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,440
"That looks like hard work, mate," said the Grasshopper."

571
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,040
"Tell me about it," said the Ant."

572
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,480
"What you doing with it?" said the Grasshopper."

573
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,520
"Taking it to our nest," said the Ant."

574
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,600
"What're you doing that for?"

575
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,120
"Food for the winter," said the Ant."

576
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,680
"Gotta get ready for the winter."

577
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,120
"Why?" said the Grasshopper."

578
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:37,040
"Winter won't come for ages. Won't be winter till...the
winter. It's summer now. Why worry about the winter?"

579
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,800
"We always worry about the winter." said the Ant.

580
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:47,400
"We spend all summer gathering up food for the winter. It's
what we Ants do."

581
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:53,000
"It's not what Grasshoppers do," said the Grasshopper.

582
00:59:53,080 --> 01:00:06,960
"We Grasshoppers know how to enjoy the summer. Eat...sleep...make some cool music...It's a fine life. We
Grasshoppers know how to live, see."

583
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,200
"Right," said the Ant.

584
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,880
"I'll leave you to it."

585
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,280
"Don't go Ant, mate," said the Grasshopper.

586
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,880
"Stick around. Pass the day with me."

587
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,240
"Sorry." said the Ant.

588
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:26,240
"Like I said, I got stuff to do."

589
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:34,840
"The Ant dragged his ear of corn and struggled off across
the field."

590
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,400
"Please yourself," called the Grasshopper.

591
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:49,920
"I'm not bothered. I got stuff to do too. Got all this grass to eat. Got the sun to enjoy. Not gonna waste a lovely day
like this talking to Ants."

592
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:58,200
"Have you ever seen a more silly creature than an Ant?"
shouted the grasshopper."

593
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:12,160
"It was winter. The Grasshopper was cold. Too cold to hop.
Too cold to make his music. And he was hungry."

594
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:19,760
"He'd spent all day looking for something to eat. Suddenly
he saw the Ant."

595
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,520
"Hello Ant," he shivered.

596
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,280
"Remember me?"

597
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,080
"Yep," said the Ant."

598
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:32,280
"Cold," isn't it," said the Grasshopper."

599
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:37,040
"Nice and warm in our nest," said the Ant."

600
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:43,120
"Not so much to eat now is there," said the Grasshopper"

601
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:53,640
"We've got plenty," said the Ant. "Our store rooms are full
of seeds and corn.

602
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,560
Got loads of food.

603
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,600
Enough to see us safely through to Spring."

604
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:09,360
"Loads of food, eh?" said the Grasshopper.

605
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:22,880
"Look...mate...I don't suppose I could...? I don't suppose
you'd be able to give me...?"

606
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:27,320
"You said you'd never seen a more silly creature than an
Ant," said the Ant."

607
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,800
"I didn't mean that," said the Grasshopper.

608
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:37,960
"That was just a joke. Oh come on. Just a couple of ears of
corn. You can spare it. I've got nothing."

609
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,480
"Sorry...mate," said the Ant.

610
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:46,040
"If you save up on the days when you have plenty then
there'll never be a day when you have nothing."

611
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:55,120
"The Ant hurried down into his warm nest knowing that he'd
never ever see that Grasshopper again."

612
01:02:55,160 --> 01:03:01,040
THE VAIN AND THE GRASSHOPPER

613
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:08,480
"One day a king was sitting in his garden watching a pair of
peacocks walking proudly across the lawn."

614
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,840
"See how beautiful those birds are," he said to the Queen.

615
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:21,120
"Our peacocks with their blue and green feathers and long
shiny tails are the most beautiful birds in the whole
world."

616
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:25,800
"Just then a swan flew over the garden and landed gracefully
on the King's lake."

617
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,880
"No," said the Queen.

618
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:34,160
"I think the swan with its long neck and silky white wings
is the most beautiful bird in the world."

619
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,040
"Peacock!" said the King"

620
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,480
"Wrong" said the Queen. "Swan!"

621
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:55,360
"The King didn't like being told he was wrong so he decided to hold a competition. All the birds were ordered to come to
the palace garden on Saturday afternoon."

622
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:01,800
"There the King and Queen and their friends would decide
which one was the most beautiful."

623
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,800
"There's no point," said the Queen.

624
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,880
"The swan is bound to win."

625
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,440
"Peacock!" said the King as he sent out his orders."

626
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:26,600
"The birds were very excited when they heard about the competition and there was much polishing of beaks and
combing of feathers as they all made themselves look beautiful for the great competition."

627
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,040
"All that is except for the jackdaws."

628
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,800
"No point," said the Chief Jackdaw.

629
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:38,920
"We're not going to win this. Everyone knows that we
jackdaws aren't beautiful."

630
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,680
"I'm not bad looking," said a young jackdaw.

631
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,520
"I might be in with a chance."

632
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:56,400
"Don't make me laugh. Look at yourself. Your feathers are all grey and black, your beak's too long for your head and
you look like you haven't had a bath in a month."

633
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:05,800
"You're a scruffy little jackdaw like us. We're clever and cunning and cheeky but none of us is ever going to win a
beauty competition."

634
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,320
"The young Jackdaw was upset."

635
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,200
"Right," he said.

636
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,680
"I'll show "em."

637
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:25,080
"Next day the young jackdaw flew to the King's garden where he found two long green and blue peacock feathers lying in
the grass."

638
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:29,560
"He picked them up in his beak and carried them back to his
nest."

639
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:38,280
"Then, down by the King's lake, he found three beautiful
white swan's feathers and carried them off too."

640
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:56,960
"Soon he had lots of brightly coloured feathers from all sorts of birds and he started to work. First he stuck bright
red and green parrot feathers onto his wings. Then on his tail he tied the beautiful long peacock feathers."

641
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:14,280
"For his head he made a hat from the silky white feathers of the swan and when his outfit was finished he looked at
himself and said, "Who's scruffy now?""

642
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:26,240
"On the day of the competition the King and Queen and their friends sat in the garden as the birds paraded past. Last to
appear was a strange brightly-coloured bird that no-one had ever seen before."

643
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,440
"What on earth is that?" said the King"

644
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:39,400
"I don't know," said the Queen, "I've never seen anything
like it before but it's very very beautiful."

645
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,760
"Yes it is," said the King."

646
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:50,880
"Yes I am," said the young jackdaw walking up and down in
front of the crowd and showing off his fine colours."

647
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:55,920
"There was no doubt about it. The King announced that this
new bird was the winner."

648
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:08,760
"The peacock and the swan both looked very cross as the young jackdaw bowed to the cheering crowd. Then something
terrible happened. His hat fell off."

649
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,880
"Just a minute," said the swan.

650
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,640
"Aren't those my feathers?"

651
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,520
"And those wings," said the parrot looking closely at the
jackdaw.

652
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,480
"Didn't they used to belong to me?"

653
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:31,280
"And that tail," said the peacock.

654
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,360
"I'd know that tail anywhere."

655
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:48,000
"Soon the young jackdaw was surrounded by birds pecking at his beautiful costume. They pulled away their lovely
coloured feathers until his costume had all gone."

656
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:54,120
"It's just a jackdaw," said the King."

657
01:07:54,120 --> 01:08:00,520
"A scruffy little jackdaw," said the Queen."

658
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:07,800
"The young jackdaw walked back to his nest very slowly."

659
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,800
"I just wanted to be special," he said."

660
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:17,240
"You don't become special just by putting on fine clothes,"
said the Chief Jackdaw."

661
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:22,920
"I know that. I know that now," said the young jackdaw."

662
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:30,680
"But the other jackdaws weren't listening to him. They'd
already flown away and left him all alone."

663
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,080
THE FROGS WHO WANTED A KING

664
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:52,360
"The Frogs should have been happy. It was summer, they had plenty to eat and nothing much to do except mess about in
the cool clear water of their pool. They should have been very happy indeed...but they weren't."

665
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:56,400
"Being a frog's a bit boring actually," said a frog."

666
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:02,520
"Yeah. It's just eating and swimming basically," said
another."

667
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:08,000
"What's the point? Why are we here? Why can't life be more
exciting?"

668
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,760
"If only we had a leader," said a fat bullfrog.

669
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:17,800
"If we had a leader he'd tell us what to do."

670
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,880
"That's right," said another Frog.

671
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,840
"If we had a leader he'd organise... parties and...plays
and... picnics and errr..."

672
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:32,320
"Of course what we really need... ...in an ideal world,"
said the bullfrog, "is a King."

673
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:43,760
"The frogs all gasped. A king! Imagine! Their very own king with a crown on his head, giving orders and telling them all
what to do."

674
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,120
"So how do we get a king?" said the little frog."

675
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,160
"To get a King," said the bullfrog, "you need to go to the
top."

676
01:09:51,160 --> 01:10:04,480
"The Frogs knew what the bullfrog meant. The king of all the gods was called Jupiter. If you needed to go to the top you
couldn't go any higher than Jupiter."

677
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:18,840
"Later that afternoon the frogs watched as the bullfrog then
climbed up onto a rock and cleared his throat."

678
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:24,840
"Excuse me," he shouted in his loudest voice.

679
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:34,400
"Excuse me, Jupiter... ...we were wondering if we could have
a King? Please," said the bullfrog."

680
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:50,720
"Jupiter was very busy and didn't want to be bothered but he knew that if he didn't give those frogs something they'd
keep croaking on and on and on...so he said:"

681
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,080
"Alright! Enough! You want a King? Well have this one!"

682
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:58,920
"Into the pond fell a huge log of wood."

683
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,320
"Wow!" said the little frog.

684
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,440
"Look how big our King is!"

685
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,560
"He's enormous," said the bullfrog."

686
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:17,840
"All day the frogs swam around their enormous King and
waited for him to speak but the new King didn't say a word."

687
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:25,800
"He's a bit quiet in't he?" said the little frog "...for a
King."

688
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,360
"Yeah," they all agreed.

689
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:31,400
"He's a bit quiet."

690
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:50,240
"Days went past and the new king never said a word. In fact he didn't even move and after a while the frogs stopped
thinking of him as a king and started using him as a diving platform and sunbathing area."

691
01:11:50,240 --> 01:12:00,240
"I don't think this King is much good to be honest," said
one of the younger frogs."

692
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:05,560
"Yes," said somebody else.

693
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:24,960
"Tell Jupiter that frogs deserve a proper king who'll move
about and be powerful and strong and frightening and..."

694
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:33,120
"Now Jupiter was listening to all this and these noisy ungrateful frogs were making him very angry indeed. He
lifted his right hand."

695
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,880
"You want a frightening king do you frogs?" he said.

696
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,840
"Well try this one for size."

697
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:53,720
"From out of the sky came a huge white stork, the biggest bird they'd ever seen. The frogs ran in terror as the stork
started gobbling them up in his huge beak."

698
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,880
"Please, Lord Jupiter," said the bullfrog.

699
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,480
"Save us. Take away this terrible King."

700
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,560
"Do you see now?" said Jupiter.

701
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,000
"Better to have no king at all than a cruel one. "

702
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,040
"But the frogs weren't listening... ...they'd all
disappeared."

703
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,440
THE CAT AND THE MICE

704
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:20,760
"On the kitchen table was a smelly cheese. The smell wafted through the kitchen. The smell spiralled down the hole in
the skirting board. The smell drifted into the noses of three little mice."

705
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:26,520
"I love ch...ch...cheese!" whined Mini-Mouse, hungrily."

706
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:30,040
"So do I!" squeaked Mildred-Mouse."

707
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:37,480
"Mighty-Mouse narrowed his eyes, "Mission required to steal
cheese!" he said."

708
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,600
"In the kitchen lived a cat."

709
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:46,240
"I'm a Terrible-Tiger-Cat!" said the cat, prowling across
the floor."

710
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:53,080
"And this Terrible-Tiger-Cat had the important job of
guarding the cheese from pesky mice."

711
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:58,120
"Under the skirting boards, the smell of cheese was too much
for the mice."

712
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,960
"Right!" said Mighty-Mouse."

713
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:16,240
"Right," said Mighty-Mouse, "Mini-Mouse you go on my right side, Mildred-Mouse goes on my left and we'll rush out,
steal the cheese and get back quick. OK?"

714
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:20,400
"What makes you think this plan will work?" said
Mildred-Mouse."

715
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,520
"Trust me!" said Mighty-Mouse confidently.

716
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,960
"We have the element of surprise! Let's GO!"

717
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:38,080
"Under the kitchen table sat the Terrible-Tiger-Cat. He watched as three little mice shot out of the hole in the
skirting board."

718
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:38,840
"Mice? I'll catch "em!

719
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,960
I'll snatch "em!"

720
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:48,800
"The Terrible-Tiger-Cat opened his terrible mouth and showed
his terrible teeth."

721
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,520
"Wait for me!" yelled Mighty-Mouse."

722
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:58,200
"In the hole under the skirting boards, three little mice
panted for breath."

723
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:02,880
"N...n...now what?" asked Mini-Mouse."

724
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,360
"NOW," said Mildred-Mouse, with grim determination.

725
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,480
"We forget the cheese! We don't need it!"

726
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:12,240
"And she marched off, leaving Mighty-Mouse looking
embarrassed."

727
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:22,280
"In the kitchen, the Terrible-Tiger-Cat waited. There was no
sign of mice. The Terrible-Tiger-Cat was bored."

728
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,880
"Mice? I'll catch "em!

729
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:31,520
I'll snatch "em!...if I can thee "em!

730
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:39,960
"Humm… maybe if I wasn't here, the mice would come out!
Maybe, if I pretend to not be here…"

731
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:53,560
"Terrible-Tiger-Cat looked up at a sack that hung from the wall. The sack was grey. Terrible-Tiger-Cat looked at his
fur. His fur was grey also."

732
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,960
"Now," he said thoughtfully.

733
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:10,600
"If I take this sack down from the wall… and if I climb up and hang myself there instead…I would look like a sack and
not like a cat! Clever, eh?"

734
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:14,800
"So Terrible-Tiger-Cat hung himself from the wall and
waited."

735
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,080
"Down the hole Mini-Mouse groaned."

736
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:24,240
"The smell of ch...cheese is killing me! If I could have one
taste…"

737
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:30,720
"Get back here!" said Mildred, grabbing Mini-Mouse's tail
and pulling him back.

738
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:35,640
"B...b...but NO CAT!" said Mini-Mouse excitedly."

739
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,560
"Humm," said Mildred.

740
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,320
"NEVER trust a cat!"

741
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,480
"She poked her snout out cautiously."

742
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:52,760
"Mildred looked up at the sack hanging on the wall. The sack
with the two bright eyes."

743
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:56,320
"No cat?" Mildred smiled wryly.

744
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:01,360
"THEN WHAT'S THAT HANGING ON THE WALL?"

745
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:05,600
"And the Terrible-Tiger-Cat replied, "Waaaoow!

746
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,640
I'm only an old sack!""

747
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:11,600
"C...c...cat!" stuttered Mini-Mouse."

748
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:27,240
"Abandon plan!" said Mighty-Mouse."

749
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:33,160
"Come on!" laughed Mildred, "Let's get back to the
mousehole."

750
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:36,040
"And there was silence in the kitchen."

751
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:39,680
"Ooopth!" said the Terrible-Tiger-Cat.

752
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,960
"I wonder what gave me away?"

753
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,480
THE LION AND THE MOUSE

754
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:57,800
"A Mouse was scurrying through the forest when he saw a Lion sleeping under a tree. The Mouse stopped and said to the
Lion. "You may be very big but I'm not scared of you.""

755
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,920
"The Mouse climbed up the Lion's tail and sat down on its
back leg."

756
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,200
"Oh no, Mr Lion, you don't frighten me one little bit."

757
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:12,640
"Still the Lion didn't move so the Mouse walked along the
Lion's side and climbed up towards his head."

758
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:23,640
"All the animals in the forest are scared of you, Mr Lion, but not us mice "cos mice are the bravest creatures in the
world."

759
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:38,280
"Again the Lion didn't move so the mouse climbed up the lions face and shouted in his ear. "Why should we be scared
of lazy lions who spend all day snoring under trees?""

760
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:47,240
"The Mouse was enjoying himself and feeling very brave when he noticed that the Lion's eye was open and looking straight
at him."

761
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:52,840
"Quick as a flash the Lion grabbed the little Mouse in his
paw."

762
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,320
"What were you saying?" said the Lion."

763
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,200
"Nothing," said the little Mouse."

764
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,040
"Something about brave mice and lazy lions"

765
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,280
"That wasn't me," said the Mouse.

766
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:08,320
"I'd never say that. I think lions are..."

767
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,560
"Quiet," said the Lion.

768
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,880
"I'm going to eat you. What do you think about that? "

769
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:21,400
"Don't think that's a good idea," said the Mouse."

770
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,560
"Why's that?" said the Lion."

771
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,520
"Because…"

772
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,800
"Because what?" said the Lion."

773
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:34,680
"Because…" And suddenly an idea flashed into the Mouse's
tiny head.

774
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:41,720
"Because one day I could help you."

775
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:44,680
"The Lion roared with laughter. "You?

776
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:50,040
How could a tiny Mouse help a huge Lion like me..?"

777
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,480
"I don't know," said the Mouse.

778
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:56,200
"Maybe I could..."

779
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,280
"Yes?" said the Lion."

780
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,280
"Maybe I could…"

781
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:01,280
"Yes?"

782
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:12,080
"The Mouse couldn't think of a single way in which a tiny Mouse could help a Lion. He shut his eyes and waited to be
eaten."

783
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:18,680
"But the Lion didn't eat the Mouse. He just laughed and
gently put the Mouse down on the ground."

784
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:22,120
"That's the funniest thing I've ever heard," said the Lion.

785
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:36,960
"A tiny Mouse helping a huge Lion like me. I'm not going to eat you after all, little Mouse. You're too funny to eat.
I'm going to let you go."

786
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,800
"Oh, thank you," said the mouse.

787
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:51,760
"I think that's a very wise decision. I meant what I said. I
will help you Mr Lion. One day. Just you wait and see."

788
01:20:51,800 --> 01:21:00,840
"The Lion laughed again: "Off you go little one," he roared,
"before I die laughing.""

789
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:04,080
"The Mouse ran away feeling very lucky."

790
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:10,920
"But the very next day he was scurrying through the forest
when he heard more roaring."

791
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:29,760
"This time though, it wasn't a roar of laughter but a roar of pain and fear. The Mouse crept closer to the terrible
sound and saw the same Lion all tangled up in a hunter's net. The more he struggled the more tangled up he became."

792
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:45,880
"He was just about to run away when the Mouse remembered how the Lion could have eaten him but let him go. And then the
Mouse remembered saying:"

793
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:53,600
"I will help you, Mr Lion. One day. Just you wait and see."

794
01:21:53,600 --> 01:22:06,640
"Suddenly the Mouse was chewing at the ropes and gnawing as fast as he could. His teeth were tiny but razor sharp and
soon he had cut the ropes and the Lion was free."

795
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:09,800
"The Mouse looked at the Lion. The Lion looked at the
Mouse."

796
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:27,360
"Yesterday I laughed when you said you would help me. I'm not laughing now. You are a very brave little Mouse. Just
goes to show you don't have to be big to be a big friend. Thank you."

797
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,560
"That's

798
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,240
alright," said the Mouse.

799
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:34,240
"You get into trouble again just give me a shout, OK?"

800
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:37,880
"OK," said the Lion and he turned and walked away."

801
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:51,880
"The Mouse watched him go. He smiled to himself and now
somehow he didn't feel quite so little."

802
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,080
THE CAGED BIRD AND THE BAT

803
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:57,440
"In a village far, far away there once lived a pretty little
songbird."

804
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:09,680
"She was in fact a very grumpy, bad-tempered little songbird. You see, she'd been caught and trapped by a young
woodsman named Fergus Fowler and he had locked her in a cage outside his cottage window."

805
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:17,480
"So there she sat looking out through the bars, longing to
be free, mumbling and grumbling all through the day."

806
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:30,840
"That nasty, horrible, grubby little good for nothing…with his muddy knees and dirty feet and his hooks and his nets
and his traps…going about catching us happy folk…"

807
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:59,160
"But oh when she sang! You've never heard such a beautiful sound. She would sing of the fields and the flowers, of the
wind ruffling her feathers and the sun warming her wings. She would sing of the sound of waterfalls and cool mountain streams tinkling and splashing over pebbles."

808
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,560
"It was a magical song that you

809
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:07,520
wished to hear from the first light of dawn till last thing
at night…"

810
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:22,800
"But that is something our little songbird…never…ever…did. Not a peep, not a whistle, not a single twitter tweet would
she utter during daytime hours."

811
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,480
"I have my reasons," said the songbird smugly to herself.

812
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:32,880
"Oh no…no I'll not do that again…I've learned that sure
enough."

813
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:54,160
"Now Fergus Fowler wasn't such a bad young lad. He was a kind, sensitive boy and he was a really terrible hunter and
if he did by some extraordinary good luck actually catch a guinea-fowl or field mouse he always set it free."

814
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,640
"He couldn't bear to see it suffer."

815
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:05,800
"The only creature that Fergus Fowler had ever actually
trapped and kept and loved very much was the songbird."

816
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:18,240
"What a wonderful song," he said… "Now you can sing for me every day!" But the little songbird hadn't sung from that
day to this."

817
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:35,120
"I might be a useless hunter," Fergus mumbled to the little bird, feeding her some of his bread, "but you're a bit of a
useless songbird too. You're very sweet and pretty, but you never, EVER sing!"

818
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:53,840
"Which was true as far as he knew because it was only when the moon was up and the owls awake, when Fergus Fowler was
sound asleep in his bed that the little songbird opened her tiny beak…and sang."

819
01:25:53,840 --> 01:26:15,200
"She would sing her beautiful tunes all through the long night hours while Fergus snored inside. But each day at
dawn, as the sun rose over the meadows, the little songbird would fall silent and pretend to be asleep."

820
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:31,960
"Late that night, while Fergus was sound asleep, the little songbird began her song. A tiny bat flew past and hearing
the beautiful sound he clung to the bars of the cage and asked:"

821
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:44,000
"Little songbird, you sing such lovely songs, but why do you only sing at night and never during the day like all the
other birds in the forest?"

822
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,640
"Oh I have a clever plan," tweeted the bird.

823
01:26:48,640 --> 01:27:00,520
"You see, the last time I sang during the day a trapper caught me in his nets and locked me in this cage. So I'll
not make that mistake again!"

824
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:06,680
"But the Bat replied, "Well it's no use your doing that now
when you're a prisoner.

825
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:12,440
If only you'd done that before you were caught, you might
still have been free.""

826
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:17,040
"And the cheeky bat flew off into the night."

827
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,920
THE FOX AND THE GOAT

828
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:47,360
"One day a rather clever Fox went out for a stroll. The sun was shining, clouds bumped along in the sky and - well,
better than that the great cloud shadows raced across the fields."

829
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:52,360
"Whoo hooo!" barked the Fox as he chased after them.

830
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:57,160
"What fun! It's a very good day to be a Fox."

831
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:09,920
"The not-quite-looking-where-he-was-going Fox laughed and - whoops! Splish! Splosh! Fox fell into a well that he just
hadn't noticed."

832
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:20,960
"That's all right! I'll jump back out again. Look at me, I can leap over hedges and fences and sleeping dogs! I'm the
best jumper there ever was!" said the rather hopeful Fox."

833
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:44,560
"However, the walls of the well were much too high. They were also slippery with moss. So, a rather soggy Fox
doggy-paddled to and fro and tried to come up with another plan. After he had swum one hundred times around the well, and back again, the rather tired Fox had to admit he was trapped."

834
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,920
"I never thought I'd end up down here," he sighed.

835
01:28:48,920 --> 01:29:00,440
"No more racing in the sunlight and chasing shadows for me!" And a rather sad Fox floated quietly in a patch of water
that reflected the sky.

836
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:05,840
Just then a goat's head appeared over the edge of the well."

837
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,240
"Hello," she bleated.

838
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:12,440
"I thought I heard a voice. What are you doing?"

839
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:16,680
"Hello," said the rather quick-thinking Fox.

840
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:24,680
"Actually, I'm having a wonderful time. This is the best
water in the whole wide world."

841
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:33,280
"Drinking it makes you happy, paddling in it makes you
healthy and it tastes delicious! It's wonderful!"

842
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:42,440
"Fox smiled and dipped his face into the water and blew
bubbles. Then drank and drank and drank."

843
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:52,320
"Oh, where are my manners," Fox said as the Goat leaned down, stretched her neck, stuck out her tongue and tried her
hardest to reach the water."

844
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,400
"Would you like some?"

845
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,080
"Yes, please," said the Goat."

846
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:03,880
"Well jump straight in and help yourself. I'll move over
here so there's room for two."

847
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:07,760
"I am very thirsty," said the Goat.

848
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:12,760
"I've just eaten thistles!" And in she leapt."

849
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:19,880
"Slurp, gargle, gulp," went the goat.

850
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:36,640
"This water is perfect – cool and sweet and delicious. Thank
you for letting me share it. Now I'll be off, there are lots of thistles waiting to be munched." Then the Goat looked up and frowned.

851
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:42,960
"Excuse me for asking, Fox, but how do we get out of here?"

852
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:48,960
"The Fox pretended to think about it for a minute, then
clicked his paws."

853
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:59,400
"I know, lean up against the side of the well and I'll climb
up your back, onto your shoulders then step on your head and I'll be out."

854
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:08,400
"Ohhhh what a good idea! You are clever," said the goat, standing on her hind legs and leaning against the mossy well
wall.

855
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:11,960
"There you are, my friend – a goat ladder!"

856
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:17,280
"Upsadaisy!" the Fox giggled as he scrambled out of the
well.

857
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,120
Then he shook his coat.

858
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:23,320
Water flew off him and the warm sunlight made his fur steam.

859
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:31,320
"Hello sky!" he cried and chased his tail before running off
across the wide, green field."

860
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,680
"Hello?" bleated the Goat.

861
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:39,200
"What about me? How do I get out?"

862
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:46,080
"Fox shouted back over his shoulder, "You should have
thought about that before you jumped in!""

863
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:50,160
"Wait!" wailed the goat."

864
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:58,640
"It was good to see you but I wouldn't want to be you!" the rather clever Fox sang, as he followed a cloud shadow over
the hill."

865
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:01,520
THE LION AND THE ELEPHANT

866
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:15,600
"It was nearly morning and the Lion had just gone to bed."

867
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:20,560
"He pulled the grass duvet over his head and closed his
eyes."

868
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:26,320
"He was just about to fall asleep when a noise sounded
across the plain."

869
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,040
"COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!"

870
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:31,000
"It was the Cockerel crowing."

871
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,160
"COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!"

872
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:36,560
"The Lion put his paws over his ears."

873
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,160
"Go away," he cried, "go away!"

874
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:46,800
"But the Cockerel didn't want to go away. He wanted to tell
the world what a beautiful morning it was."

875
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,640
"The Lion kept his head under the duvet."

876
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:52,920
"That noise is driving me mad," he said.

877
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,320
It was the same every morning.

878
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,600
The sun came up and the Cockerel crowed.

879
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:02,600
And each time he heard it the Lion hated it more.

880
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,280
It made him feel afraid."

881
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:15,320
"Why is it," he asked himself, "that someone like me, who is brave and strong and fearless should be afraid of the sound
of a harmless cockerel?"

882
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:18,920
"He decided to talk to the other animals."

883
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:25,120
"Monkeys," he asked, "does the sound of the Cockerel make
you feel afraid?"

884
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,000
"No," said the monkeys together.

885
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,240
"We're not afraid of anything."

886
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:39,440
"Hippopotamus," asked the Lion, "you are big and strong like
me. Is there anything that frightens you?"

887
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:46,040
"The hippopotamus was bathing in the river. He blew a stream
of bubbles out of his nose."

888
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:50,560
"Nothing frightens me," he said."

889
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:54,000
"Not even the sound of a cockerel crowing."

890
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,040
"Especially not the sound of a cockerel crowing."

891
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:04,680
"Ashamed of his weakness the Lion turned away. A crocodile
was sunbathing near by."

892
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,680
"Are you afraid of anything, Crocodile?" the Lion asked."

893
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:11,320
"The crocodile thought for a moment."

894
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:14,640
"Jam sandwiches!" he answered."

895
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:20,920
"The Lion thought this was a strange thing for the crocodile
to be afraid about, but he didn't argue."

896
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:26,200
"Just then an elephant lumbered out of the forest."

897
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:31,600
"If anyone can answer my question, he can," thought the
Lion."

898
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,680
"Elephant, can I speak to you?" he asked."

899
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:39,320
"Not today, Lion," said the Elephant, shaking his head.

900
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:41,320
"I have a problem."

901
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:45,760
"Is it a serious problem?" asked the Lion."

902
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,520
"It is to me," said the Elephant.

903
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:54,400
And he shook his head so hard the Lion thought the
elephant's ears would come off."

904
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,360
"I've got a serious problem too," said the Lion."

905
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:05,760
"Well, you tell me your serious problem and I'll tell you
mine," said the Elephant."

906
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:11,520
"So the Lion told the Elephant all about how afraid he was
of the crowing of the cock."

907
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:15,560
"I sympathise with you, Lion," said the Elephant.

908
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:23,160
And he gave his head another massive shake."

909
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:26,920
"Do you see a small insect buzzing around?" he continued."

910
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:32,680
"The Lion could just make out a gnat near the Elephant's
head."

911
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:39,400
"If that insect flies inside my ears," continued the
Elephant, "I am positive I am done for."

912
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:44,760
"You mean you are afraid of a tiny gnat?" queried the Lion."

913
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:48,160
"Yes," said the Elephant."

914
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:59,840
"The Lion thought about this for a minute. It was hard to believe that such a strong, wise and clever animal could be
afraid of so small a thing."

915
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:03,960
"Now the Lion felt sorry for the Elephant."

916
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:08,400
"Your fear is worse than mine," he told him.

917
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:14,040
"I am sorry now I troubled you at all."

918
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,440
"I'm glad you did," said the Elephant."

919
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:23,400
"The next morning when the Cock crowed the Lion turned over
in bed and went back to sleep."

920
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:31,640
"It's just a noise," he told himself, "it can't possibly
hurt me."

921
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:34,320
"And he was right."

922
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:38,440
THE CROW AND THE PITCHER

923
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:47,240
"This is the story of a pitcher and a crow, and a pitcher is
a jug, in case you didn't know."

924
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:54,360
"Old Mr Crow was a big black bird with a big black beak and
he lived at the top of a tree."

925
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:58,680
"He was a clever old creature."

926
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:05,800
"There's no problem you can't fix if you only take the time
to think about it!" he would say."

927
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:15,440
"And over the years, Old Mr Crow had managed to solve lots of problems…just through taking the time to settle his
feathers and think."

928
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:33,400
"When he wanted to feast on a juicy clam that was hiding inside its tightly shut shell, Mr Crow solved the problem by
dropping the shell from a great height so it hit the ground and burst open. "This clam sure tastes delicious!" he cawed."

929
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:41,720
"Go, go Mr Crow, you're the smartest bird we know!" chirped
the Sparrow Sisters."

930
01:37:41,760 --> 01:38:22,920
"Walnuts were even trickier for a crow to crack open, but Mr Crow solved that problem too. "I'll let the cars that drive
by do the work for me," he cawed. Then he plucked a walnut from the tree and dropped it in the road, just by the crossing. A car drove over it and cracked the walnut open. When the traffic lights turned red and the traffic stopped Mr Crow hopped into the road and pecked up the tasty nut."

931
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:32,720
"Go, go Mr Crow, you're so clever don't you know!" chirped
the Sparrow Sisters."

932
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:39,800
"Then one day Mr Crow came across a problem he thought he
couldn't solve."

933
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:56,800
"The weather had been hot and dry for weeks and all the water had dried up in the pond. Mr Crow was very thirsty. He
flew for miles looking for water but wherever he went the streams and ponds were dry."

934
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:07,480
"Then, as he was flying by a farm house, he noticed a pitcher in the garden. "Maybe that pitcher will have water
in it," he thought."

935
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:28,360
"So he flew down to look. There was a little bit of water at
the bottom, not much, but enough for a crow. Mr Crow put his beak in eagerly…but the pitcher was tall and the water was shallow and his beak couldn't reach."

936
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:33,520
"I can see the water, but I can't drink it!" he said to
himself.

937
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:38,520
"And without the water I will die of thirst. This is a
problem!"

938
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:54,400
"Mr Crow settled his feathers and thought for a while…and as he was thinking, his black beady eyes spotted a small
stone…"Hmm," he thought, "I wonder if that stone can help me solve my problem?""

939
01:39:54,400 --> 01:40:04,480
"Then he had an idea…he picked the stone up in his beak and he dropped it in the pitcher…this made the water in the
pitcher rise, just a little."

940
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:07,400
"I need more stones," thought Mr Crow.

941
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:14,520
He flew around the yard searching for stones and, one by
one, he dropped them into the pitcher.

942
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:21,120
Each time the water rose a little but each time he dipped
his beak in but it wouldn't reach the water."

943
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:43,120
"Mr Crow worked all day…flying backwards and forwards picking up stones and dropping them in… then at last, as the
sun was setting, he looked into the pitcher and saw that he had almost filled it with stones. Now the water had risen high enough for his beak to reach."

944
01:40:43,120 --> 01:41:10,480
"Go, go Mr Crow, you're so clever don't you know!" chirped
the Sparrow Sisters"

945
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:19,440
"A problem's not a problem if you take the time to think,"
said Old Mr Crow as he settled down to drink."

946
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,960
THE FOX AND THE STORK

947
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:40,640
"A rather large bird was wandering round the wood, looking a
bit lost. It had long legs, a long thin neck and a very long bill for eating, that clattered away as it searched for nice things to eat."

948
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:45,280
"Hey there, big bird!" cried the little birds in the trees
above.

949
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:49,680
"You're new round these parts, aren't you?"

950
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,600
"Indeed I am," replied Stork.

951
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:55,520
"And I'd like to make some friends."

952
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:01,040
"I'll be your friend," purred a soft voice from behind a
bush.

953
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:06,320
Out slunk Fox with his shiny red coat and soft paws."

954
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:11,280
"Oooo, we wouldn't make friends with old Foxy if we were
you," chorused the birds.

955
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,560
"He's a bit of a joker."

956
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:15,080
"Oh, ignore them", Fox purred reassuringly.

957
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:18,640
"Please, allow me to show you round the woods…"

958
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:23,960
"Fox and Stork were soon laughing and chatting as if they'd
known each other forever…"

959
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:27,120
"What do you like to eat, Stork?" asked Fox.

960
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:33,280
"Frogs, fish, insects and earthworms are my favourites,"
replied Stork."

961
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:36,720
"Mine too – oh, leaving aside frogs," said Fox.

962
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:43,000
"I eat nuts and berries too – and I'm very partial to the
occasional little bird."

963
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,120
"Boo, hiss!" cried the birds from above."

964
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:50,760
"Only joking," said Fox rather too quickly.

965
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:55,280
"Would you like to come around my house tomorrow for supper,
Stork?"

966
01:42:55,320 --> 01:43:00,160
"It's a trick, it's a trick!" chorused the birds."

967
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:02,480
"Thank you, Fox, I'd love to!"

968
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,560
"That night, Stork flew over to Fox's house."

969
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:12,360
"Come in!" cried Fox as he showed Stork into the dining
room.

970
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:16,280
"I hope you like fish soup with mashed earthworms."

971
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:28,920
"Stork was expecting to see two bowls full of lovely steaming soup – but instead, two flat plates covered in a
thin layer of liquid lay on the table."

972
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:34,800
"Stork tried her hardest to eat the soup with her bill, but
it was impossible."

973
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:44,560
"Fox meanwhile was already licking his bowl clean. "Oh,
dear, is there a problem?" he asked with a smirk."

974
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:47,320
"Not at all," replied Stork.

975
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:54,000
"It's just – well, I had rather a large tea before I came
and my tummy's full."

976
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:59,560
"Tea – I like the sound of that," purred Fox.

977
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:06,160
"Well, why don't you come to my home tomorrow and join me?"
suggested Stork.

978
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:11,640
"I shall look forward to it," replied Fox."

979
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:21,040
"Stork flew home that night with a heavy heart. "We warned
you, we warned you!" chorused the birds."

980
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:26,200
"I know, my so-called friend tricked me," replied Stork.

981
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:29,160
"But I may yet have the last laugh."

982
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:40,920
"The next day, Fox set off for Stork's house. "Shame on
you!" cried the birds as he slunk under their tree."

983
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:50,880
"Stork can take a joke," Fox replied.

984
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:55,480
"And after all, she's invited me over for tea."

985
01:44:55,480 --> 01:45:00,840
"Hee, hee!" sniggered the birds."

986
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,520
"Come in!" said Stork to Fox.

987
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:11,400
"I've cooked roast rabbit on a bed of grass with berry and
nut sauce."

988
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:16,440
"Mmm, my favourite," said Fox as Stork carried in a tray."

989
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:29,680
"He stared at the tall jar Stork had placed in front of him.
It was long and thin and the food lay right at the bottom."

990
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:42,480
"Fox watched in frustration as Stork stuck her long bill into her jar and gobbled up the meal. "Oh dear," said Stork.
"Is there a problem?"

991
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:43,640
"None at all," growled Fox.

992
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:51,480
He stuck his nose as far down the jar as he could, but he
still couldn't reach his dinner."

993
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:54,080
"And now there really was a problem. "Yowl!

994
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:57,800
The jar's stuck to my face!" came Fox's muffled cries."

995
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:04,600
"Hee hee! Serves you right, Foxy," chorused the birds who
were watching on the window sill.

996
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:08,080
For once, Fox couldn't answer back."

997
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:13,200
"I'll pull it off with my wings," offered Stork kindly."

998
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:18,680
"Hmmm, I guess I deserved that after the joke I played on
you," said Fox sheepishly.

999
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:22,400
"Never mind," said Stork.

1000
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:48,960
"I've got plenty of food in the kitchen. This time we'll have it on proper plates – and our little feathered friends
can have some too."

1001
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,720
"Wee, hee!" cried the birds."

1002
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:51,800
TWO TRAVELLERS AND A BEAR

1003
01:46:51,800 --> 01:47:15,280
"One cold winter's day two friends set off to travel to the town. They talked and laughed as they strode along. It was
cold and snow was falling but the two men hardly noticed - they were enjoying each other's company so much. What a pleasant fellow he is, each of them thought. I'm glad that we are travelling together."

1004
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:28,880
"The road to the town lay through a forest. It was late by the time the men reached it. "We should turn back," one of
them said to the other nervously. "It'll soon be dark and there are bears in that forest.""

1005
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:35,080
"His friend was just as scared as he was. But didn't want
his friend to know. So he laughed. "Pah!

1006
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:35,680
Bears.

1007
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:37,080
That's nothing to be afraid of.

1008
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:41,080
I fought a bear once – and he ran away.""

1009
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:45,840
"The other man felt ashamed of himself. I am a coward, but
he is brave, he thought. "Then we'll go on," he said."

1010
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:58,840
"It was very dark in that forest. The trees grew close together. It was hard to see the road clearly. It was hard
to see anything at all!"

1011
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:13,880
"But the man wasn't afraid any more. He listened as his friend told him all about his fight with the bear. "It was
very big," he boasted. "Twice as big as me.

1012
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:17,560
But I picked up a stick and fought it off.""

1013
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:39,960
"All of a sudden there was an enormous crash. And out of the
bushes lumbered - a bear. The men had never seen such a huge bear. When it saw the men it licked its lips. "At last!" it said, standing up on its hind legs and growling. "Dinner!""

1014
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:51,720
"With a cry of fright, the friend ran to the nearest tree and hauled himself up onto a branch. "Aren't you going to
fight it?" the man cried."

1015
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:56,000
"Fight it! You must be mad," said his friend.

1016
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:02,240
"It will kill us." The man ran up to the tree where his
friend crouched, trembling.

1017
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:09,080
"There's room for us both in that tree," he cried.

1018
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:12,280
"Help me up.""

1019
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,400
"But his friend pushed him away.

1020
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:23,240
"No there isn't. Find somewhere else to hide," he said."

1021
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:26,760
"What shall I do?" the man thought.

1022
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:31,200
The bear was so close now he could have stretched out a hand
and touched it.

1023
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:40,160
"If I try to run it will run faster. If I fight it, it will
kill me. It is bigger and stronger than me.""

1024
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:43,760
"He flung himself to the ground and lay there, as still as
he could.

1025
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:50,880
"Perhaps it will leave me alone," he thought, "if it thinks
I am dead.""

1026
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:52,280
"The bear was very hungry.

1027
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:56,680
It hadn't eaten for a long time.

1028
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:00,480
But it was puzzled when it saw the man drop to the ground.

1029
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,120
"Is he dead?" it wondered.

1030
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:04,200
"Let me see.""

1031
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:10,640
"It bent down, so close that the man could feel its fur
brush his cheek.

1032
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:15,880
Then it put out a paw and prodded him.

1033
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:19,760
The man lay still, his heart pounding.

1034
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:24,960
"Any minute now," he thought, "that bear will tear me to
pieces." But the bear got up.

1035
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:30,800
"He hasn't moved. He must be dead," it thought.

1036
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:38,800
"And I don't like dead meat." And it ambled away sadly into
the forest."

1037
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:55,200
"The man got up and dusted himself down. He didn't look at his friend. He was very angry with him. He had pretended to
be brave, but he was a coward. He had left him to face the bear on his own."

1038
01:50:55,240 --> 01:51:00,920
"I saw the bear whisper in your ear," the friend said
climbing down from the tree.

1039
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:03,800
"What did he say?"

1040
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:14,720
"He said a man who leaves his friend to face danger isn't a true friend." And with that he turned away, leaving the
other to make his own way home."

1041
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:27,640
THE GOOSE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGGS

1042
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:50,520
"There once was a very poor farmer. So poor he lived in an old tumbledown pigsty in the middle of nowhere with only
acorns and the odd goose egg to eat and a bale of straw for his bed. His name was Attacus Greeb."

1043
01:51:50,520 --> 01:52:08,000
"Now Attacus Greeb hadn't always been poor. He'd inherited a large and prosperous farm from his father and he'd owned
land as far as the eye could see. But Attacus Greeb was a lazy man. He didn't like work."

1044
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,880
"I'm far too good to be milking cows," he said.

1045
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:19,200
"I should be Lord of the Manor with servants and footmen…and
heaps of silver and gold."

1046
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:27,280
"So over the years, instead of working for a living he'd
simply sold off his possessions."

1047
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:41,160
"He'd sold almost everything his father had given him - his house, his land, his horses, his pigs, his cattle and all he
was left with was one single goose who lived with him."

1048
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:46,760
"Oh what is to become of me?" wailed Attacus late one night.

1049
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:59,000
"I have no house, no food and no money and nothing left to sell…I shall surely starve!" And then he looked at his
goose."

1050
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:15,200
"It's no good honking at me goosey it's off with you to the market tomorrow – you haven't laid an egg in weeks and your
feathers will fetch me a fair few guineas." And off he went to sleep."

1051
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:41,000
"The next morning Attacus Greeb awoke to a glittering dawn. It was so light and bright he had to shield his eyes. But it
wasn't the sunlight shining, he could hardly believe what he saw, it was a gigantic, glorious…Golden Egg! "You clever girl!

1052
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:41,160
Ha!

1053
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:42,080
H!a Ho!

1054
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:44,160
Ho!

1055
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:45,880
We'll be rich!

1056
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:49,320
Rich beyond our dreams!""

1057
01:53:49,480 --> 01:54:05,440
"So off he went to market pushing the egg in an old wheelbarrow… and back he came with a barrowful of meat to
cook, chicken feed for his goose and a huge bag of coins."

1058
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:14,400
"Oh how I wish I had money to buy a horse-drawn carriage,"
he said patting his full tummy that night.

1059
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,880
"That's what I need to be happy."

1060
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:36,680
"Well, the very next morning the same thing happened…there was another shiny golden egg lying beside the goose. So off
went Attacus to market and with the money he got he bought a smart black carriage and six sleek horses."

1061
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:47,640
"And every day the same thing happened and every day Attacus
Greeb counted his money and wished for more and more."

1062
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:58,080
"But as fast as the little goose could lay a golden egg Attacus Greeb wanted more. "Why can't you lay more eggs each
day?

1063
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:02,040
We need more, we need more I say!""

1064
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:14,240
"Soon the farmer became a very rich man indeed – but as he
grew rich, he grew greedy – and still he wanted more."

1065
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:16,720
"And then he had an idea."

1066
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:27,760
"How I wish I could have all the golden eggs at once," he thought, "instead of just one a day. Then I would surely be
happy."

1067
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:46,960
"So the next morning he ordered his cook to kill the goose and open it up so he could take out all the eggs at once –
but, of course, to his horror there was nothing inside the poor goose…and there would be no golden eggs again."

1068
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:55,480
"And Attacus Greeb ended up back in his tumble-down pigsty -
just where he belonged!"

1069
01:55:55,480 --> 01:56:02,440
"Those who have plenty want more and so lose all they have."

1070
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:04,640
THE KID AND THE WOLF

1071
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:22,800
"Once there was a billy goat kid who lived with his mother
on a farm."

1072
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:27,440
"Each morning he and the other goats were herded into a
meadow."

1073
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:30,360
"And each evening they were driven home again."

1074
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:41,800
"At the edge of the field was a wood. The grass grew thick and sweet there because the goats never went near it. The
kid looked at it

1075
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:50,640
longingly. "Don't go there," the other goats warned him. "A
big bad wolf lives in that wood."

1076
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:54,760
"Yes, mind you stay close by me," said his mother."

1077
01:56:54,760 --> 01:57:08,200
"At first the kid did stay close by his mother. But with each day that passed his horns grew bigger. "I am not a
little kid any more," he thought. "I can look after myself.

1078
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:11,680
Anyway, I don't believe a wolf lives in that wood.

1079
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:14,880
The goats are just a bunch of scaredy-cats!"

1080
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:17,960
He trotted over to where the juiciest grass grew.

1081
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,600
The goats shook their heads when they saw where the kid
was."

1082
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:26,560
"Baaa. Silly young thing," they said."

1083
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:51,600
"The little kid was very happy. He tore up the long stalks of sweet grass. He was so busy eating that he didn't hear
his mother call him. He didn't even notice the dogs rounding up the goats to drive them home. "Oh, I do hope my little goat is safe," his mother said as they were herded out of the field."

1084
01:57:51,600 --> 01:58:01,520
"At last the kid had had enough. He lifted up his head. The
goats had gone. He was all alone."

1085
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:11,440
"Long shadows crept towards him. It was growing dark. The
kid did not feel so big and brave any more."

1086
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:16,240
"Mother," he bleated, running up and down the field.

1087
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:19,000
"Where are you? I want to go home."

1088
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:25,080
"But his Mother didn't hear him. She was far away, down the
lane."

1089
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:34,600
"But someone heard him. Big yellow eyes followed the kid, as
he ran up and down the field. It was the wolf."

1090
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:37,760
"He couldn't believe his luck."

1091
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:42,920
"It's time for my dinner and that kid will do nicely," he
smiled."

1092
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:44,240
"Well, we did warn him."

1093
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:51,200
"And with a single bound he was out of the wood. The kid
tried to run away, but the wolf put out a paw."

1094
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:54,400
"Whoa!" he growled.

1095
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,280
"Not so fast!"

1096
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:59,120
"He smacked his lips."

1097
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:05,360
"If only I had listened to Mother," thought the kid.

1098
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:13,240
"What shall I do? How can I stop the wolf from eating me?
Help! Help!" He bleated, as loudly as he could.

1099
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:16,880
But the dogs and goats couldn't hear him."

1100
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:32,680
"The wolf growled, showing sharp yellow teeth. Then the kid had an idea. "If I can get the wolf to sing, maybe Mother
will hear him and save me," he thought."

1101
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:35,040
"Mr Wolf," he squeaked.

1102
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:42,320
"I'm sure you have a beautiful voice. Will you sing for me?
And I will dance for you. I like dancing."

1103
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:50,120
"The wolf considered. "Why not?" he thought. "A little music
before dinner.""

1104
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:52,960
"He opened his mouth to sing."

1105
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:59,880
"Eeurgh what is that," the rabbits said darting back into
their burrows."

1106
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:06,760
"What a horrible noise!" said the moles digging themselves
hurriedly down into the earth."

1107
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:17,320
"But in the pasture the little kid pranced and frolicked, kicking up his little legs as if he was having the most
wonderful time. "Oh wolf, he gasped.

1108
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:20,040
"How beautifully you sing.""

1109
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:31,960
"You really think so?" simpered the Wolf, and howled even
louder. No one had ever told him he sang beautifully
before."

1110
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:45,920
"Down the lane the dogs and goats also heard the wolf. They stopped and looked at each other. "It's the wolf!" one of
the dogs cried. "Oh, please – save my little goat!" cried the kid's mother."

1111
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:49,080
"The dogs tore back into the field barking loudly."

1112
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:59,720
"The wolf turned his head and saw them. He leapt for the
trees just as one of the dogs was about to seize his tail."

1113
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:10,240
"Why did I let that kid flatter me?" he growled to himself
as soon as he got his breath back.

1114
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:22,920
"Am I daft? I should have eaten him at once!"

1115
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:26,120
THE OLD LION AND THE FOX

1116
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:34,640
"It isn't easy being old," said Lion one day as he looked in
the mirror."

1117
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:43,680
"Look at my fangs, they're all worn down and my claws are
short and stubby!"

1118
02:01:43,680 --> 02:02:00,680
"I'm so hungry, I could eat a herd of wildebeests," Lion grizzled, "but I'm not very good at hunting these days, I'm
too slow! I need to think of an easy way to catch my dinner."

1119
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:03,400
"Then he had an idea."

1120
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:20,240
"If I can't get to my dinner, I'll make my dinner come to me! I'll pretend that I'm sick and all the animals will feel
sorry for me… they'll come to visit and as soon as they do I'll gobble them up!"

1121
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:32,640
"Lion put his plan to work straight away. He settled himself in his den, put on his poorly face and let out a sorrowful
growl."

1122
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:44,800
"Oh woe is me, oh woe is me, I'm feeling sick as sick can
be!" he groaned."

1123
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:47,920
"Bird came flitting by…"

1124
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:53,240
"Oooh poor lion, you look very skinny!" she said."

1125
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:59,680
"That's because I'm poorly and I haven't felt like eating!"
lion fibbed."

1126
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:08,520
"Let me check your temperature," chirped bird and she hopped
inside lion's jaws with her thermometer."

1127
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:16,600
"Then Lion nabbed her – grrr, grrr, snap…and put her in his
dinner sack."

1128
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:24,640
"Bird's aren't very filling," said Lion, "let's see what
else I can catch."

1129
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:31,960
"He put on his poorly face again and let out another
sorrowful growl."

1130
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:40,920
"Oh woe is me, oh woe is me, I'm feeling sick as sick can
be!"

1131
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:45,480
"Monkey jumped down from a tree to help."

1132
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:48,120
"What's wrong with you Lion?" he asked."

1133
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:52,320
"I feel weak and wobbly!" Lion fibbed."

1134
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:58,360
"Well you are looking a bit skinny… let me look at your
tongue," said monkey kindly.

1135
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:01,360
He peered inside lion's jaws…"

1136
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:08,520
"Then Lion nabbed him – grrr snap… and put him in his dinner
sack."

1137
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:16,320
"There isn't much meat on a monkey," grizzled Lion, "I'll
have to keep trying."

1138
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:21,440
"I need one more creature…something bigger I hope."

1139
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:24,160
"He let out another sad roar."

1140
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:31,480
"Oh woe is me, oh woe is me, I'm feeling poorly as can be!"

1141
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:37,760
"That's a shame," said Fox, appearing at the door of Lion's
den."

1142
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:43,120
"I think I might have a thorn in my throat," grizzled Lion.

1143
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:45,800
"Maybe you can pull it out."

1144
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:56,040
"Fox looked at all the footprints outside Lion's den - they
were leading inside, but they didn't come out again."

1145
02:04:56,040 --> 02:05:00,320
"She spotted Lion's dinner sack too… it was wriggling."

1146
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:03,320
"Hmmm," she thought!

1147
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:07,360
"Lion is up to something, I'd better be careful."

1148
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:18,080
"I'll pull out the thorn in your throat," Fox told Lion, "but it's a tricky job, I want you to close your eyes and
keep very still."

1149
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:24,840
"Lion closed his eyes tight, opened his jaws and got ready
to snap."

1150
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:30,440
"He waited and he waited then suddenly Fox shouted."

1151
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:33,760
"You can open your eyes now Lion."

1152
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:40,000
"Lion opened his eyes just in time to see Fox running off
with his precious dinner sack."

1153
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:44,560
"Drat, thought Lion, there goes my dinner!"

1154
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:52,600
"When Fox reached the wood she opened Lion's dinner sack and
set the creatures free."

1155
02:05:52,640 --> 02:06:04,920
"I'll set you free this once, gruffed Fox. But never fall for Lion's bluffs, "cos if you do not use your brains,
you'll end up in his sack again!"

1156
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:06,800
THE EAGLE AND THE JACKDAW

1157
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:35,840
"Oh my, look at that bird!" a Jackdaw exclaimed to her
husband one day.

1158
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:40,280
High above the nest a great eagle was soaring."

1159
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:50,440
"Oh isn't he magnificent," she sighed watching him circle
and swoop.

1160
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:54,320
She leant over the nest to take a better look.

1161
02:06:54,400 --> 02:07:02,560
Perched next to her was her husband who pushed back his
shades and looked out to see what the fuss was all about."

1162
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:05,600
"Hmm. He's just an eagle," he grumbled.

1163
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:10,840
"I'm as fine a bird as him!" The nest was full of things
he'd collected.

1164
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:13,920
Rings, bottle tops, feathers."

1165
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:22,760
"The jackdaw smiled, looking at the glittering heap. "Mrs
Jackdaw," he said to his wife. "You are a lucky bird.

1166
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:27,000
Look at all the beautiful things I've brought you.""

1167
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,520
"Humph!" grumbled the jackdaw's wife.

1168
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:38,440
"What use is it? You can't eat feathers and bottle tops! If
only you brought back something useful for a change."

1169
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:55,480
"The jackdaw was very cross. He stared at the eagle as it swooped downwards. Suddenly he heard a bleat. The eagle had
seized a lamb that had got separated from the flock in the pasture below."

1170
02:07:55,480 --> 02:08:12,840
"The lamb bleated and struggled. But it was no use. The eagle had him firmly gripped in his talons. Up and up he
flew again, higher and higher, the lamb swinging from his claws."

1171
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:23,560
"The jackdaw had had enough. "I'll show her," he muttered to
himself. "I'm just as big and strong as that eagle.

1172
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:25,360
She'll see."

1173
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:28,360
He hopped out of the nest."

1174
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:32,120
"Then flapping his wings he flew down to a bush."

1175
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:50,000
"His eyes gleamed as they lit on the farmer's prize ram. "Won't she be surprised when I bring that ram back for tea?"
he chuckled. And putting on his fiercest expression down he plopped, onto the ram's back."

1176
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:57,240
"Up we go!" he cawed happily, flapping his wings and rising
up into the air again.

1177
02:08:57,240 --> 02:09:01,880
But all that was swinging from his claws was a bit of wool.

1178
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:06,160
He dropped down again and tugged a bit harder."

1179
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:25,640
"But he couldn't budge the ram. Up and down the jackdaw jumped, furiously flapping his wings and tugging at the
ram's woolly coat."

1180
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:28,280
"But he couldn't lift the ram."

1181
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:34,400
"Silly old bird," said Mrs Jackdaw, who was watching.

1182
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,400
"He thinks he's an eagle!"

1183
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:49,920
"The jackdaw pulled and he tugged, but the more he tugged and the more he pulled the more his claws got caught in the
ram's woolly coat until he could hardly move at all."

1184
02:09:49,920 --> 02:10:06,000
"Leaning by the gate, a shepherd had been watching. He ran up to the ram. "Silly old bird," the shepherd said taking
out a pair of scissors to clip his wings. "I'm taking you home with me.

1185
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,520
Can't have you messing with my flock.""

1186
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:19,040
"When he got home that night the shepherd put the jackdaw down on the table. "Come and see what I've brought you," he
said to his children."

1187
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:22,080
"The children crowded round the table."

1188
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:26,040
"What sort of bird is it, Father?" one of them asked.

1189
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:31,880
"Well I call it a jackdaw, but he thinks he's an eagle," the
shepherd chuckled.

1190
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:35,040
He gave the jackdaw a stern look.

1191
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:38,680
"Perhaps you've learned your lesson now," he said.

1192
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:42,000
The jackdaw hung his head."

1193
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:54,840
"Up in the jackdaw's nest, his wife stretched out happily. "I've seen the last of him," she said. "And good riddance
too.

1194
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:56,000
Useless bird.

1195
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,880
Fancy thinking he was an eagle!""

1196
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:09,920
THE WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING

1197
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:28,280
"Mr Wolf dreamt of eating a nice woolly sheep for his
supper…but he just couldn't catch one."

1198
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:40,680
"He spent his time spying on the sheep in Farmer Foggarty's field… and thinking of wily ways to catch them. But his wily
ways never seemed to work."

1199
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:59,120
"One time he'd waited behind a rock for hours just so he could pounce on a juicy sheep…but when he heard the sound of
hooves and he leapt out of his hiding place…it was not a sheep he pounced on… …but an angry bull."

1200
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:06,600
"It looked like Mr Wolf was never going to get a Sheepie
Supper."

1201
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:13,680
"Then one day when he was visiting his Auntie Marge he
noticed a large sheep skin rug on the floor."

1202
02:12:13,680 --> 02:12:34,160
"Ha, he thought, I will borrow Auntie Marge's rug and disguise myself as a sheep, then I can easily get into
Farmer Foggarty's sheep pen; and once I'm in there, gnash, gobble, gnash, gobble…I will have my sheepie supper!"

1203
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:42,760
"As soon as he arrived home with the sheepskin rug he
dressed himself up and then practised talking in Sheep

1204
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:44,080
language."

1205
02:12:44,080 --> 02:12:59,680
"It was tricky at first, baaa…grrr! baaa…grrrr… but he soon
got the hang of it Baaa! Baaa! Baaa!"

1206
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:08,840
"Then he set off to Farmer Foggarty's field to join the
sheep. On the way he checked his reflection in the pond."

1207
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:12,800
"I look cute, he said. Baaaa-ootiful!"

1208
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:28,000
"Farmer Foggarty's sheep were grazing happily when Mr Wolf slyly slipped amongst the flock. He nibbled some grass just
like they did. But it tasted yucky."

1209
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:39,640
"So far his plan was working; the sheep didn't seem to notice him, even though he was larger than they were; they
all just kept nibbling the grass."

1210
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:51,720
"I'll wait til sunset when the farmer puts the sheep in the pen and when I'm tucked up tight with them, gnash, gobble,
gnash, gobble, I'll have a delicious sheepie supper."

1211
02:13:51,720 --> 02:14:03,680
"When sunset came, the farmer and his dog herded the sheep into their pen and in went Mr Wolf as well. His disguise had
worked."

1212
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:14,400
"Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm going to get me some juicy sheep!
said Mr Wolf to himself."

1213
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:17,920
"Mummy, said one of the lambs, that

1214
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:20,040
sheep smells a bit funny!"

1215
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:24,280
"Don't be rude, said the lamb's mother."

1216
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:32,160
"Ha ha, thought Mr Wolf, because you're so rude little
lambie, you will be the first to be gobbled."

1217
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:37,600
"Sheep are woolly, sheep are yummy, Sheep are best in my
tummy!"

1218
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:46,200
"He flashed his claws and opened his jaws and was just about
to pounce when…Farmer Foggarty appeared."

1219
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:58,520
"He was ready for his supper too. He wasn't having Bolognese. He wasn't having beans and mashed potatoes in a
heap. He was having SHEEP!"

1220
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:10,000
"The farmer looked at the herd carefully, he spotted the biggest, juiciest looking sheep and he hooked it with his
shepherd's hook. It was Mr Wolf."

1221
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:20,840
"Drat, thought Mr Wolf. I thought I was going to get my
Sheepie Supper, but it looks like I'm the sheepie supper!"

1222
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:29,280
"With a lightning fast wriggle he freed himself from the
farmer's hook…and off he shot as fast as his legs could go."

1223
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:40,960
"Excellent work, said Farmer Foggarty to his sheep, we
fooled that wily Mr Wolf! Now I'm off to have my egg and
chips!"

1224
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:42,120
THE GOATHERD

1225
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:46,960
AND THE WILD GOATS

1226
02:15:46,960 --> 02:16:06,800
"Wild goats live in wild, rocky places where it is hot during the day and cold during the night. They eat dry
leaves and thistles and bits of twig. Sometimes they go hungry."

1227
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:27,240
"Sherpa, the leader of the wild goats was a magnificent creature. He had a noble head, a long beard and two
extraordinary horns. The horns were so unusual they curled upwards and then downwards and ended up pointing in different directions from each other."

1228
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:32,040
"Sherpa wasn't only magnificent, he was also wise."

1229
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:38,840
"I've had a brilliant idea," he said to the rest of the herd
one day."

1230
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:46,000
"He pointed to some other goats, in a field further down the
valley, eating a big pile of fragrant hay."

1231
02:16:46,040 --> 02:17:03,600
"They are tame goats," said Sherpa, "and they are looked after by a man called a Goatherd. They have plenty to eat
and a warm place to sleep. Not like us! We are often hungry and cold."

1232
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:08,600
"The wild goats stopped clambering over rocks to listen."

1233
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:20,040
"My idea," Sherpa went on, "is to hop over the fence and
join them. Then we would be looked after too!"

1234
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:23,240
"The other goats liked the sound of this."

1235
02:17:23,240 --> 02:17:35,240
"So, later that day, when the goatherd was changing his socks, the wild goats hopped into the field with the tame
goats and pretended they had been there all the time."

1236
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:38,440
"That night it started to snow."

1237
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:43,360
"The goatherd rounded up his goats and counted them."

1238
02:17:43,360 --> 02:17:45,120
"That's funny," he said.

1239
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:49,120
"There are twice as many now, than there were before."

1240
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:55,600
"He was pleased. More goats meant more milk and cheese to
sell in the market."

1241
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:59,320
"The goatherd looked after his new goats well."

1242
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:03,120
"He gave them the best food and the warmest beds."

1243
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:07,800
"He brushed their coats and polished their hooves and combed
their beards."

1244
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:09,480
"He spoiled them."

1245
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:14,800
"If they are happy they'll stay with me," he said to
himself."

1246
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:19,320
"But the goatherd didn't look after his own goats."

1247
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:23,520
"He turned them out in the snow and gave them less to eat."

1248
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:27,240
"He no longer brushed and polished and combed them."

1249
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:28,920
"He treated them unfairly."

1250
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:32,240
"But, the wild goats couldn't believe their luck."

1251
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:35,880
"This is the life," they said to each other."

1252
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:42,040
"Their leader, Sherpa, wasn't so sure. He was beginning to
have doubts."

1253
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:45,320
"I'm not happy about this," he said.

1254
02:18:45,320 --> 02:18:49,680
"Why is the goatherd treating his own goats so badly?"

1255
02:18:49,680 --> 02:18:54,520
"Who cares about them," said one goat, unkindly."

1256
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:57,560
"As long as we are all right," said another."

1257
02:18:57,560 --> 02:19:00,040
"Sherpa told them off."

1258
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:02,120
"Think carefully," he said.

1259
02:19:02,120 --> 02:19:09,400
"What happens if some newer goats come along. Will the
goatherter start treating us badly?"

1260
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:15,480
"The more Sherpa thought about it, the more certain he was
he was right."

1261
02:19:15,520 --> 02:19:22,000
"We have to leave at the first opportunity," he told his
herd."

1262
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:32,680
"Spring came and the snow disappeared. The wild goats went back into the field. But Sherpa hadn't forgotten what he had
said."

1263
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:40,840
"One afternoon, when the goatherd was dozing in the sun,
Sherpa ordered the wild goats to play leapfrog."

1264
02:19:40,840 --> 02:19:56,200
"They made a lot of noise, running and jumping and getting in each others way. And by the time the goatherd could work
out what was happening, the wild goats had not only leapfrogged over each other they also leapfrogged over the fence."

1265
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:58,880
"The goatherd was furious."

1266
02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:01,000
"Rascals!" he yelled.

1267
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,720
"Is this how you repay my kindness?"

1268
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:08,200
"Sherpas answer came from half way down the valley:"

1269
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:13,200
"You should have treated all your goats the same," he called
back."

1270
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:16,080
"That would have been real kindness."

1271
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:22,360
"The tame goats, left behind in the field, nodded their
heads sadly."

1272
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:24,160
"They had to agree."

1273
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:29,160
THE DOG IN THE MANGER

1274
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:55,280
"It had been another busy day at the farm. Dog yawned. It was hot, hot, hot! And Dog was tired. He looked around for
somewhere to snooze. The barn was shady and quiet."

1275
02:20:55,280 --> 02:21:12,880
"And in the barn there was a manger, and it was full of hay to feed the cows. Ah, yes! The manger was just the right
place for a dog to sleep. It was soft and smelled of fresh hay and it was cool in the barn after the heat of the sun."

1276
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:24,760
"Dog climbed into the manger and turned around – once…twice…
three times – and curled himself into a nest of hay with his nose by his tail."

1277
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:30,600
"At that moment, who should come into the barn but Bull and
all the cows?"

1278
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:38,240
"Time for some dinner, my dears?" said Bull, stepping aside
to allow his wives to go into the barn first."

1279
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:44,720
"Oh, thank you dear!" replied Queeny-cow, daintily strolling
in at the head of the herd.

1280
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:51,520
"You are such a gentleman! A nice munch of cool hay would be
very nice – OH!"

1281
02:21:51,520 --> 02:22:02,920
"She stopped when she saw Dog. All the cows stopped when they saw Dog. Dog didn't open his eyes, but his ears pricked
up like satellite dishes."

1282
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:09,920
"Oh dear, said Queeny-cow, as Bull came up beside her.
"There appears to be a dog in the manger!""

1283
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:13,240
"A dog? A dog?" blustered Bull.

1284
02:22:13,240 --> 02:22:22,320
"What would a dog be doing in the manger? Dogs don't eat
hay! I say! I say, Dog! What are you doing in our manger?"

1285
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:24,000
"Sleeping," grunted Dog.

1286
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,280
"Go away!"

1287
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:29,320
"Well!" said Queeny-cow in a sulky voice.

1288
02:22:29,320 --> 02:22:32,800
"That's no way to behave in front of ladies!"

1289
02:22:32,840 --> 02:22:36,520
"You are not ladies – you are cattle," said Dog.

1290
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:38,760
"That's what you are."

1291
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:42,480
"Well!" squeaked Queeny-cow, offended.

1292
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:45,520
"I have never been spoken to in that way!"

1293
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:49,680
"Hrmph!" snorted Bull.

1294
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:59,520
"I must ask you to not speak to my wife that way. She's very delicate, you know! My dear," he said to Queeny-cow, "Leave
this to me!"

1295
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:09,760
"Sir!" he continued, lowering his head and displaying his
very fine horns, "I must ask you to leave the manger NOW!"

1296
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:12,400
"Or else?" asked Dog.

1297
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:18,120
He rose up on stiff legs, lowered his head and bared his
teeth.

1298
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:20,760
"OR ELSE?" he barked."

1299
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:26,760
"Bull looked at the fierce dog and backed away in sudden
confusion."

1300
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:31,280
"Alright! Alright! K..K..Keep your hair on!"

1301
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:34,120
"Attack him!" Queeny-cow encouraged.

1302
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:36,040
"Don't be cowed!"

1303
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:40,480
"I am cowed!" squeaked Bull, backing away towards the door.

1304
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:48,560
"I have just remembered what my dear old mother always used
to say to me! She said "Let sleeping dog's lie!"

1305
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:50,240
Goodbye!"

1306
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:53,200
"And Bull lumbered out of the barn."

1307
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:55,360
"Well!" said Queeny-cow.

1308
02:23:55,360 --> 02:24:03,240
"So much for him - we'll do this my way!" she said, turning
smartly and wandering out of the door."

1309
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:08,680
"Delusional!" muttered Dog, watching the cows nudging out of
the barn door.

1310
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:13,760
"Daft!" snorted Dog, turning around three times in the hay.

1311
02:24:13,960 --> 02:24:23,160
"Dippy!" decided Dog, curling himself into a nest of hay
with a groan of contentment and shutting his eyes."

1312
02:24:23,360 --> 02:24:26,680
"DOG!" roared a man's voice."

1313
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:30,200
"Farmer John stormed furiously in through the barn door."

1314
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:32,560
"DOG!" he shouted angrily.

1315
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:50,280
"Get out of that manger at once, you selfish animal! There are silly cows milling everywhere they shouldn't be! I've
got cows in my kitchen! I've got cows in my car! And I've got a Bull hiding under my bed! Stop being a dog in a manger and go and round up the sheep!"

1316
02:24:50,320 --> 02:24:57,440
"Dog jumped down from the hay and skulked out of the barn
with his tail between his legs."

1317
02:24:57,440 --> 02:24:58,800
"Drat!" he sighed.

1318
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:10,720
"It's a dog's life!"

1319
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:12,160
ANDROCLES AND THE LION

1320
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:40,840
"Once there was a slave called Androcles who belonged to a very cruel master. Androcles worked all day long in his
master's fields and was never paid a single penny. He was always tired and hungry and one night Androcles decided to escape."

1321
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:52,240
"He waited until his master was fast asleep then he crept out of the house...and silently made his way into the
forest...and started running."

1322
02:25:52,240 --> 02:26:08,640
"Androcles knew that if he was caught he'd be punished so he ran all night and in the morning he lay down to rest. He'd
just fallen asleep when he was woken by a terrible roaring sound."

1323
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:34,240
"Androcles jumped to his feet and standing right in front of him was a huge Lion. He was about to run away when he
noticed the lion was holding out his paw...and...he wasn't really roaring...he was crying because a huge thorn was sticking out of his paw."

1324
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:39,480
"Ouch! No wonder you're crying," said Androcles to the lion.

1325
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:44,240
"I'd like to help you but if I come any closer you'll
probably eat me."

1326
02:26:44,240 --> 02:26:54,600
"But the lion had such a sad look in its eye that before Androcles had time to think he'd stepped forward and pulled
out the thorn."

1327
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:59,040
"The lion opened his mouth and let out a terrible cry..."

1328
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:09,560
"...and for a moment Androcles thought he was going to be eaten but instead of biting Androcles the lion gently licked
his face."

1329
02:27:09,560 --> 02:27:15,760
"Androcles fetched some water from a stream and washed the
Lion's bleeding paw."

1330
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:19,480
"You'll be alright now," said Androcles."

1331
02:27:19,480 --> 02:27:30,600
"The lion licked Androcles one last time as if to say "thank
you" then limped off into the forest. Then Androcles heard a voice"

1332
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:34,840
"That's him. Quickly...tie him up."

1333
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:42,800
"Androcles knew that voice. It was his master. Six men
grabbed Androcles and tied him up with ropes."

1334
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:46,080
"Thought you would escape did you?" said the master.

1335
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:48,160
"Nobody escapes from me."

1336
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:56,920
"Now Androcles was in really big trouble. The men took
Androcles to the city and threw him in prison."

1337
02:27:56,920 --> 02:28:01,760
"Next day a prison guard brought Androcles some food."

1338
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:14,080
"Do you hear that roaring Androcles? We haven't fed that lion since we caught him. But he's going to have plenty to
eat tomorrow when we put you in his cage."

1339
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:25,680
"Next morning Androcles was taken to a huge arena like a football stadium. The Emperor and thousands of his people
had come to see a man being eaten by a lion."

1340
02:28:25,680 --> 02:28:38,240
"In the centre of the arena was a cage and in the cage was a
huge, very hungry lion."

1341
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:46,480
"The crowd clapped and cheered as the guards pushed
Androcles into the cage and slammed the door shut."

1342
02:28:46,480 --> 02:29:00,480
"Everyone went very still as the lion leapt towards Androcles. But then something odd happened. The lion stopped
and stood very still."

1343
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:10,200
"He knew this man. He'd seen him somewhere before. Then he
remembered the thorn that had stuck in his paw."

1344
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:14,520
"Are you going to eat me then old friend?" said

1345
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:15,400
Androcles."

1346
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:20,320
"But the lion just purred and licked the slave's face."

1347
02:29:20,320 --> 02:29:28,600
"At first the crowd were angry. This wasn't supposed to happen. They hadn't paid good money to see a lion lick a
man's face."

1348
02:29:28,640 --> 02:29:36,200
"But the Emperor stood up and said, "This is the most
amazing thing I've ever seen.""

1349
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:40,040
"and he started to clap..."

1350
02:29:40,040 --> 02:29:45,520
"...and the people thought, "If the Emperor's clapping then
maybe I should clap too.""

1351
02:29:45,520 --> 02:30:04,240
"Soon clapping and cheering rang round the arena. Androcles was taken to the palace and when the Emperor heard the story
of the lion and the thorn he announced that both Androcles and the lion should be given their freedom."

1352
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:11,960
"Androcles, you helped the lion so the lion helped you" said
the Emperor."

1353
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:18,600
"See how one good deed leads to another. You're a free man
now."

1354
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:25,480
"Androcles and the lion walked out of the city together;
both free."

1355
02:30:25,480 --> 02:30:28,120
THE DOG AND HIS REFLECTION

1356
02:30:28,120 --> 02:30:56,280
"When Patch was young he was a good dog. He was warm and soft and had the sweetest breath, and he licked the tip of
your nose if you let him."

1357
02:30:56,280 --> 02:31:04,320
"And because he was so good he was allowed to stay in the
farm kitchen. The other farm dogs lived outside in a
kennel."

1358
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:15,360
"But just because a dog is warm and soft and good when he's a puppy, and licks the tip of your nose if you let him, it
doesn't mean he will grow up like that."

1359
02:31:15,400 --> 02:31:24,600
"Once, when Patch was a fully grown up dog he pulled the cloth off the table and all the family's dinner crashed to
the floor."

1360
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:30,760
"He had eaten it all up before the farmer's wife came
running in."

1361
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:34,640
"Bad dog!" scolded the farmer's wife."

1362
02:31:34,640 --> 02:31:40,720
"He barked at the children and bit their legs when they rode
their bikes."

1363
02:31:40,720 --> 02:31:43,960
"Bad dog!" cried the children."

1364
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:50,760
"He pulled up all the flowers outside the kitchen door, dug five holes in the lawn and did his business in the farmer's
hat."

1365
02:31:50,800 --> 02:31:53,920
"Bad dog!" yelled the farmer."

1366
02:31:53,920 --> 02:32:07,560
"So Patch was sent outside with the other dogs. And because people only said "bad dog!" to him, everyone forgot he'd
once been called Patch. Now he was called simply, "Bad Dog"."

1367
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:17,360
"At feeding time every dog had their own bowl of biscuits and scraps from the table, but Bad Dog would get to them
first."

1368
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:23,560
"He would growl and snarl and turn up his lips to show how
sharp his teeth were."

1369
02:32:23,560 --> 02:32:46,000
"The other dogs had to wait, licking their mouths until Bad Dog had finished eating. When he had eaten all the meat and
the gravy, and all the dog biscuits from the bowls, all that was left was dry bread and carrots and broccoli, and lots of other things that farmers eat but dogs don't."

1370
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:49,560
"But then one day he went too far."

1371
02:32:49,680 --> 02:33:00,480
"The smell of roast meat was wafting out from the kitchen. Bad Dog ran in, snatched the huge bone with the meat still
on and ran off with it."

1372
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:03,960
"Bad Dog," screamed the farmer, running after him.

1373
02:33:03,960 --> 02:33:07,080
"Come back with that meat now, or you'll never come back
again!"

1374
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:16,920
"Bad Dog took no notice. This was a whole big bone with the meat still on, not scraps, and he wanted it more than
anything."

1375
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:20,040
"So Bad Dog ran away with it."

1376
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:30,120
"He ran for a long time until at last he came to a little bridge. This would be a good place to stop and eat his
stolen dinner."

1377
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:33,120
"He looked over the side of the bridge."

1378
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:35,040
"And had such a shock!"

1379
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:46,640
"Below him in the still water was another dog. A big, fierce, ugly dog - and this dog had a bone with all the meat
on too!"

1380
02:33:46,640 --> 02:34:01,800
"Bad Dog had to have it. Two joints of meat! His lips turned back in a snarl, and so did the lips of the other dog. He
opened his mouth to growl…And so did the other dog!"

1381
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:08,000
"And the bone fell from Bad Dog's jaws into the water and
was taken away by the stream."

1382
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:16,720
"It had been his own reflection in the still water he had
seen, and now instead of two bones he had nothing."

1383
02:34:16,720 --> 02:34:24,240
"Bad Dog felt sad. He had lost everything that was
important."

1384
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:25,520
"From now on,"

1385
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:41,600
he said to himself, "I shall try and be better. I shall be good instead of bad and nice instead of nasty. Then one
day... ...everyone will love me again."

1386
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:45,920
"And that is what happened."

1387
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:49,040
"If you are too greedy, he realised, it's easy to end up
with nothing."

1388
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:50,800
THE HERON AND THE FISH

1389
02:34:50,800 --> 02:35:04,680
"The heron walked like a king along the grassy river bank."

1390
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:07,960
"The otter curtseyed as the heron passed."

1391
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:12,160
"The water vole bent his knee as the heron passed."

1392
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:20,960
"The kingfisher bowed so low as the heron passed that she turned completely upside down on the branch she was clinging
to."

1393
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:23,960
"But the otter was not being polite."

1394
02:35:23,960 --> 02:35:34,680
"The water vole was not being reverent. The kingfisher was not being respectful. They were making fun of the heron,
though he didn't know it."

1395
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:38,720
"They thought he had far too good an opinion of himself."

1396
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:41,440
"They laughed at him behind his back."

1397
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:52,680
"Herons are only birds. They are not Princes or Prime Ministers, Presidents or pop-stars. They are definitely not
Kings, even if they walk like Kings on

1398
02:35:52,680 --> 02:35:57,240
grassy river banks. In other words, they are nothing
special."

1399
02:35:57,240 --> 02:35:59,520
"They just think they are."

1400
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:04,400
"They parade along in a very high-minded fashion with their
noses in the air."

1401
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:07,560
"Or they would do if they had noses."

1402
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:09,480
"They have long beaks instead."

1403
02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:30,920
"Everything about the heron is long – he has a long beak, long neck, long body and long legs. The heron has especially
long legs. And although the heron walks along the grassy river bank on his especially long legs, he only stands on one of them, so he has a spare."

1404
02:36:30,920 --> 02:36:42,160
"There is one good thing to be said of herons: they have great patience. When fishing he can stand quite still for
hours waiting for their supper."

1405
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:50,440
"He was quite snappy if the otter and the water vole and the kingfisher were there before him because they made such a
kafuffle."

1406
02:36:50,440 --> 02:37:05,440
"They were always doing things, these lesser creatures. They
chattered. They swam. They dug holes in the river bank. They did high dives and low belly-flops; all splashy, noisy, annoying things!"

1407
02:37:05,480 --> 02:37:06,280
"They

1408
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:10,680
played games, when all he wanted was peace and quiet."

1409
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:26,600
"Then one day he came to the river later than usual. The others had already finished for the day. The otter was
curled up on the grassy bank. The water vole was cleaning his fur. The kingfisher was pecking at something in his feathers."

1410
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:28,440
"At last," thought the heron.

1411
02:37:28,440 --> 02:37:32,120
"I shall have the river to myself."

1412
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:41,920
"He waded out to his favourite spot of clear water, pulled up his spare leg so that he was standing on only one, and
began being patient."

1413
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:47,840
"It didn't take long for a minnow to swim by. The heron
watched it go past."

1414
02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:52,560
"You missed a fish, oh great one," said the otter."

1415
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:56,400
"It wasn't worth my attention," said the heron."

1416
02:37:56,400 --> 02:38:02,840
"Then a stickleback swam by, and kept swimming by and the
heron still didn't move."

1417
02:38:02,840 --> 02:38:08,320
"You missed a nice little snack there, majesty," said the
water vole."

1418
02:38:08,320 --> 02:38:10,240
"Nice for you," said the heron.

1419
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:11,840
"Little for me."

1420
02:38:11,880 --> 02:38:18,200
"Other fish swam by, each larger than the one before, but
the heron gave them hardly a glance."

1421
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:25,120
"Then a very fine perch came by, a prize fit for a King –
but not for a heron."

1422
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:30,000
"You missed a big one there, Highness," said the
kingfisher."

1423
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:34,280
"Only a salmon is good enough for me!" claimed the heron."

1424
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:41,280
"But not another fish came by that day; not a minnow, not a
stickleback, and especially not a perch."

1425
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:48,600
"The heron could have eaten his fill if he'd been satisfied
with what was on offer."

1426
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:51,600
"Instead he went hungry…"

1427
02:38:51,640 --> 02:38:58,520
"…Except for one tiny snail."

1428
02:38:58,520 --> 02:39:08,360
"So, don't be too hard to please or you might end up with
nothing."

1429
02:39:08,400 --> 02:39:11,080
THE EAGLE AND THE TORTOISE

1430
02:39:11,080 --> 02:39:29,120
"In a tumbledown cottage deep in the countryside lived Old Mrs Mumbles. Every morning, she opened the kitchen door…and
threw the remains of last night's dinner onto the grass."

1431
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:35,800
"Three, two, one…bet I get there first!" cried Racy Rabbit."

1432
02:39:35,800 --> 02:39:44,720
"All the animals that lived in the garden charged towards
the food – all except Tod the very slow tortoise."

1433
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:46,960
"Wait for me…!" he croaked.

1434
02:39:46,960 --> 02:40:00,720
But it was no good – Racy Rabbit, Fox and the birds were greedily tucking into vegetable peelings and left over
stew…and by the time Tod arrived, there was nothing left."

1435
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:09,200
"It's not faaaaaair, he moaned. "I've only got short little
legs and my shell is really heavy.

1436
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:13,200
I'm so slow I always get there last."

1437
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:19,000
"Never mind, Tod," squeaked his friend, Milly Mouse.

1438
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:22,160
"Look, I've saved you a nice piece of lettuce."

1439
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:30,080
"As Tod chomped away, he spotted a great Eagle soaring on
the light breeze way up high."

1440
02:40:30,120 --> 02:40:35,240
"I wish I could fly like that eagle," he sighed.

1441
02:40:35,240 --> 02:40:39,640
"Just imagine how fast and free I would be!"

1442
02:40:39,640 --> 02:40:52,280
"The next day, Tod poked his head from his shell – and nearly jumped out of it in surprise. For the eagle was
standing on the grass, looking right at him."

1443
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:57,640
"Us eagles have very good eyesight you know", she said in a
rather raspy voice.

1444
02:40:57,680 --> 02:41:07,120
"I read your lips yesterday. And I have come to grant you
your wish. I shall teach you to fly in the sky."

1445
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:12,000
"Ohhh! Thank you, Eagle!" cried Tod.

1446
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:15,560
"I'll give you anything you want in return."

1447
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:20,720
"Anything?" asked the Eagle with a glint in her eye."

1448
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:24,840
"Yes, anything," replied Tod."

1449
02:41:24,840 --> 02:41:38,760
"Tod gasped with excitement as the Eagle carried him high into the sky. Mountains and oceans and forests and castles
were spread out below as far as he could see."

1450
02:41:38,800 --> 02:41:43,960
"I can fly!" cried Tod with delight."

1451
02:41:43,960 --> 02:41:51,440
"Now, there's just the small matter of my payment," said the
Eagle."

1452
02:41:51,440 --> 02:42:01,640
"I'm rather partial to small, cuddly creatures for my tea,
so I'd like that little mouse you were talking to."

1453
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:09,000
"What?! But you can't eat Milly – she's my best friend,"
protested Tod.

1454
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:13,720
"But you promised to give me whatever I wanted," said the
Eagle."

1455
02:42:13,720 --> 02:42:19,600
"Er, yes I know - but not Milly, pleeeease…" pleaded Tod."

1456
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:29,840
"There was a horrible silence. Todd shivered in the cold wind and looked down. It was an awfully long way to the
ground…"

1457
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:32,720
"Very well then," said the Eagle.

1458
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:41,120
"You wanted to fly – so let's see how you manage by
yourself." And with that, she shook Tod off her back."

1459
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:46,840
"Heeeeeeelp!" cried Tod as he fell through the air.

1460
02:42:46,840 --> 02:42:50,920
"You forgot to tell me how to do it!!!"

1461
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:57,680
"It's easy, just flap!" cried the now distant Eagle."

1462
02:42:57,680 --> 02:43:05,440
"Tod flapped and flapped his little legs, but it was no use.
Down he dropped like a very heavy stone."

1463
02:43:05,440 --> 02:43:10,720
"I don't think I like flying after all…" he gasped.

1464
02:43:10,760 --> 02:43:19,440
"I'd much rather be back on the ground. The problem is, the
ground's getting very close…very fast…!"

1465
02:43:19,480 --> 02:43:29,520
"As the garden rushed up to meet him, Tod shut his eyes…then
ever so slowly…opened them again…"

1466
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:42,880
"He had landed in a giant pile of lettuce leaves. "We thought we'd give you a soft landing just in case your
flying lesson went horribly wrong," giggled Racy Rabbit."

1467
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:51,320
"Lucky for you, Old Mrs Mumbles had a big party last night,
and threw out loads of left overs!" added Milly."

1468
02:43:51,320 --> 02:44:08,280
"That night, the animals celebrated with a feast. "Thanks for saving my life, guys," said Tod as he chomped on
lettuce. "You know, I much prefer being slow and steady to flying all fast and whizzy.

1469
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:12,120
I even like my shell a bit more.""

1470
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:20,800
"He pulled his little friend under his shell, and they
munched to their hearts" content till the sun came out
again."

1471
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:25,120
THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSE

1472
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:34,080
"Town Mouse was very fond of his own appearance."

1473
02:44:34,080 --> 02:44:58,840
"I shall visit my friend Country Mouse," he announced one morning, waxing his whiskers with a dab of butter and
admiring his reflection in the teapot.

1474
02:44:58,840 --> 02:45:13,080
"And he shall see what a very fine mouse I am!" And with a hop and a skip he straightened his bow tie and scurried off
to catch the 10.17 packing crate bound for Paddington station."

1475
02:45:13,080 --> 02:45:38,720
"Meanwhile, deep in the trunk of an old chestnut tree, Country Mouse was busy dusting and tidying, cleaning and
sweeping and cooking an extra special hotpot of beans and corn to welcome his cousin from the city. He had been collecting food all week to celebrate."

1476
02:45:38,800 --> 02:45:47,360
"There was a loud rap at the door and Country Mouse took off
his apron and scampered over to greet his friend."

1477
02:45:47,360 --> 02:46:11,400
"There on the doorstep stood Town Mouse looking very smart indeed in his pin-stripe suit and bowler hat. He handed
Country Mouse his gloves and bag, looked down his long nose and said, "What a very small house you have dear cousin… no chandeliers, no Persian rugs… no velvet cushion to rest upon?""

1478
02:46:11,400 --> 02:46:21,360
"Country Mouse smiled, he was very fond of Town Mouse and he ignored his snooty remarks - he knew that he didn't mean to
be rude."

1479
02:46:21,400 --> 02:46:31,160
"Come and sit down, dear cousin. You must be tired and hungry from your journey," he said pulling out a little
acorn stool for him to sit on."

1480
02:46:31,160 --> 02:46:37,320
"What no napkins?…no silver service?" sniffed Town Mouse.

1481
02:46:37,320 --> 02:46:40,480
"No scented bowl to wash my paws?"

1482
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:47,240
"Country Mouse smiled again and served up the hot soup and
barleyseed bread."

1483
02:46:47,240 --> 02:46:51,440
"What is this food?" scoffed Town Mouse.

1484
02:46:51,440 --> 02:46:54,680
"No caviar, no steak tartare?"

1485
02:46:54,680 --> 02:47:04,640
"No pickled herring and horseradish sauce?! Come, my friend,
this instant! We're off to the city and I shall show you how to live!""

1486
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:31,560
"It was late that night when they arrived at Town Mouse's House and as they crept along the hall to the grand dining
room Country Mouse felt the soft wool carpet under his tired little paws and the warm glow of the fire and he remembered the cold, bitter wind that blew through his country tree cottage."

1487
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:42,480
"And how his little eyes beamed and his whiskers twitched at the sight of the left over feast that was laid out on the
table for them to gobble up!"

1488
02:47:42,480 --> 02:47:53,720
"There were soufflés and sandwiches, savoury flans and pastries. There were jellies and trifles and fresh cream
cakes and a MOUNTAIN of meringues…"

1489
02:47:53,760 --> 02:48:03,240
"Couthin…I'b neber seen such a banquet as thith!" cried
Country Mouse."

1490
02:48:03,240 --> 02:48:09,080
"But this is how you could feast EVERY night my friend!"
laughed Town Mouse."

1491
02:48:09,080 --> 02:48:12,280
"The two little mice had a very merry time…"

1492
02:48:12,280 --> 02:48:17,680
"Then all of a sudden there was a thunderous ROAR!"

1493
02:48:17,680 --> 02:48:26,160
"Wwwwwwwhat's that terrible noise Cousin?!" stammered
Country Mouse."

1494
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:34,320
"H-h-h-h-hoover?!" cried the terrified little mouse."

1495
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:36,440
"Yes…oh and the Humans"…"

1496
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:45,800
"And just at that moment the door burst open and in marched
a team of kitchen staff with brooms and mops."

1497
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:54,480
"WHAT EEZ ZEES?!" shouted the French Chef…"MEESES! Quick
hoover zem up!"

1498
02:48:54,560 --> 02:49:01,520
"Yikes!" squeaked Country Mouse as they scampered down the
table leg and through a crack in the floorboards.

1499
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:05,760
"I'm off!" he cried as he scurried off under the door."

1500
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:09,080
"So soon?" called Town Mouse.

1501
02:49:09,080 --> 02:49:13,720
"No fabulous food? No smart city life?"

1502
02:49:13,720 --> 02:49:23,400
"No, no, dear cousin," called Country Mouse over his
shoulder.

1503
02:49:23,400 --> 02:49:35,880
"And no loud scary monsters to gobble me up! It's the simple, safe life at home for me…not the rich, dangerous
high life!"

1504
02:49:35,880 --> 02:49:37,560
BELLING THE CAT

1505
02:49:37,560 --> 02:50:02,680
"The mice who lived on a farm were very happy because the farmer's cat which was supposed to hunt and kill mice was
old and lazy and spent most of his time sleeping in the sunshine."

1506
02:50:02,680 --> 02:50:08,920
"Can't be bothered with catching mice any more," said the
old cat.

1507
02:50:08,920 --> 02:50:16,320
"All that lurking about and pouncing. Got better things to
do...like sleeping."

1508
02:50:16,320 --> 02:50:28,280
"So the mice ran about safely all over the farm and had
plenty to eat...until one day an awful thing happened."

1509
02:50:28,280 --> 02:50:52,880
"The farmer came into the farmyard carrying a wooden box. He
put it on the floor and...out of the box walked a cat; a new young cat with black sleek fur and long sharp claws. The cat looked around the farmyard and she sniffed the air."

1510
02:50:52,880 --> 02:50:58,400
"Huh, she's nothing to be scared of," said a young mouse.

1511
02:50:58,400 --> 02:51:02,200
"She's only a cat. Only a lazy old cat."

1512
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:12,880
"But an old mouse wasn't so sure. The new cat didn't look
old...or lazy. This cat looked young and keen and...hungry."

1513
02:51:12,880 --> 02:51:17,680
"Just be careful," said the old mouse.

1514
02:51:17,680 --> 02:51:22,160
"Just keep your eyes open and be very careful."

1515
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:38,760
"That night the new cat prowled the farmyard. She walked silently in the darkness; invisible in her black coat. She
watched and she waited; listening for the tiniest sound."

1516
02:51:38,760 --> 02:51:49,600
"In the morning when the mice met for breakfast in the barn
there didn't seem to be quite so many of them."

1517
02:51:49,600 --> 02:51:54,200
"Where is everyone this morning?" said the young mouse."

1518
02:51:54,200 --> 02:52:03,200
"I wonder," said the old mouse looking at the new cat who was sitting outside the farmhouse with a big smile on her
face."

1519
02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:10,720
"Each night more mice disappeared… and the new cat seemed to
be getting fatter."

1520
02:52:10,720 --> 02:52:16,720
"Soon the mice were really scared. Finally the old mouse
called a meeting."

1521
02:52:16,760 --> 02:52:19,520
"We have to do something," he said.

1522
02:52:19,520 --> 02:52:26,560
"If we can't get rid of this cat she'll end up eating us
all. We need a plan."

1523
02:52:26,560 --> 02:52:39,160
"The problem," said the old mouse, "is that you can't hear the cat coming. She moves silently in the darkness. You
don't know she's there...until it's too late."

1524
02:52:39,160 --> 02:52:42,920
"That's it!" said the young mouse.

1525
02:52:42,920 --> 02:52:52,840
"We get a bell and tie it round the cat's neck. The bell will ring every time the cat moves and we'll know where she
is so she'll never catch us."

1526
02:52:52,880 --> 02:52:55,720
"The mice all looked at each other."

1527
02:52:55,720 --> 02:52:58,800
"Not bad," said someone."

1528
02:52:58,800 --> 02:53:03,440
"Actually, that's brilliant!" said someone else."

1529
02:53:03,440 --> 02:53:15,080
"The mice leapt into action. One group found a little bell that had fallen off the back of the farmhouse door and
another found some string which had been holding up a scarecrow's trousers."

1530
02:53:15,080 --> 02:53:17,280
"See," said the young mouse.

1531
02:53:17,280 --> 02:53:27,320
"We have everything we need for my brilliant plan. That cat
has eaten her last mouse. All our troubles are over."

1532
02:53:27,320 --> 02:53:40,480
"The mice all cheered and patted the young mice on the back. The young mouse had saved everyone from being eaten and
suddenly he was a hero...for about ten seconds."

1533
02:53:40,520 --> 02:53:45,560
"Just one question," said the old mouse.

1534
02:53:45,560 --> 02:53:49,280
"Who's going to tie the bell on the cat?"

1535
02:53:49,280 --> 02:54:01,360
"The mice all went silent then looked at the young mouse. The young mouse looked at the floor. He didn't want that
job. Nobody wanted that job."

1536
02:54:01,360 --> 02:54:04,840
"Oh dear," said the old mouse.

1537
02:54:04,840 --> 02:54:10,960
"It's easy to say something but often harder to actually do
it."

1538
02:54:10,960 --> 02:54:12,920
THE TOO FAT FOX

1539
02:54:12,920 --> 02:54:39,200
"A bitter wind blew the last leaves from the trees as Fox
made his way across the fields in search of food."

1540
02:54:39,200 --> 02:54:59,840
"The lake had been frozen for weeks and the livestock were tucked up safe and warm in the farmer's winter barns. Fox
couldn't remember when he had last eaten. His skinny ribs stuck through his patchy, moth-eaten coat, his teeth chattered and the hard frosty ground hurt his paws as he walked."

1541
02:54:59,880 --> 02:55:17,880
"Not a chicken, not a bird, not a puny little rabbit…not a scrap of food for a fox to eat…I shall surely die of cold
and hunger," he muttered miserably as he huddled up against a gnarled old tree trunk for shelter."

1542
02:55:17,880 --> 02:55:32,600
"Earlier that morning, not far from where our Fox was crouching, Mrs Tom Cobbler was busy fussing around her
husband and shooing him out of the farmhouse."

1543
02:55:32,600 --> 02:55:56,680
"Here's yer shopping list Mr Tom Cobbler - one nice, juicy leg of pork, 2 kilos of potatoes, half a bag of carrots, 2
onions and some big, firm cooking apples for our Sunday lunch. Now don't you go forgetting anything Mr Tom Cobbler. You're the most forgetful man I ever knew!" and she waved a dishcloth at him."

1544
02:55:56,680 --> 02:56:07,880
"Yars, Mrs Tom Cobbler…er I mean… no dear, I won't forget." And he stuffed the shopping list in his trouser pocket and
walked off to market."

1545
02:56:07,880 --> 02:56:17,320
"It was a long, cold walk to market and it was a long, hard walk back with his rucksack full of his wife's Sunday
shopping."

1546
02:56:17,320 --> 02:56:27,120
"Mr Tom Cobbler decided to sit down for a moment's rest beside a tree. (The very tree our Mr Fox was going to huddle
close too later on.)"

1547
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:36,320
"After his rest and before he set off down the lane he looked about for a place to hide his shopping bag and saw a
hollow in the tree trunk."

1548
02:56:36,320 --> 02:56:49,800
"Ah, that'll do, he said. "That'll keep it safe from foxes – that hole's far too small for a plump ol" fox to climb
through." And off he tramped up the hill towards the farmyard."

1549
02:56:49,800 --> 02:57:15,760
"Well…what a nice surprise for our Mr Fox crouching beside that very same tree later that morning. His sly foxy nose
began to twitch…and he sniffed the cold wintry air…there was a whiff of FOOD nearby! And it seemed to be coming from the hollow of the very tree he sat against."

1550
02:57:15,760 --> 02:57:30,520
"And because he was so very starved and thin – our TOO THIN MR FOX was able to slip easily through into the hole. And
what did he find inside? That's right! All Mrs Tom Cobbler's Sunday dinner!"

1551
02:57:30,520 --> 02:57:37,840
"And what did he do with it? That's right! He gobbled it all
up, lickity-quick."

1552
02:57:37,840 --> 02:57:54,080
"And he felt very full indeed…SO full in fact that our TOO THIN FOX had become TOO FAT FOX in a matter of ten minutes
flat! Too fat in fact to fit back through the hole."

1553
02:57:54,160 --> 02:58:07,320
"So our Mr Fox had to wait and wait for days and days until his plump little tummy turned thin once more…and he could
climb back out through the hole of the tree again and off in search of food."

1554
02:58:07,320 --> 02:58:12,440
"Which just goes to show – that if you wait long enough –
the problem

1555
02:58:12,440 --> 02:58:14,240
might go away."

1556
02:58:14,240 --> 02:58:17,440
"And what happened to old Mr Tom Cobbler that day?"

1557
02:58:17,480 --> 02:58:27,240
"Well, Mrs Tom Cobbler wasn't happy at all that he'd lost the Sunday roast - so he had turnip soup and potato peel pie
instead!"

1558
02:58:27,240 --> 02:58:29,320
THE RAT AND THE ELEPHANT

1559
02:58:29,320 --> 02:58:51,960
"A Rat was walking through the city. He was a very proud Rat
who believed that he was the most frightening animal alive."

1560
02:58:51,960 --> 02:58:55,920
"Oh, yes!" said the Rat to himself.

1561
02:58:55,920 --> 02:58:57,880
"Everyone's scared of me."

1562
02:58:57,880 --> 02:59:02,680
"Scary Rat coming through. Out of my way."

1563
02:59:02,720 --> 02:59:08,800
"The Rat turned a corner and saw a crowd of people standing
by the side of the road."

1564
02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:10,520
"Brilliant," thought the rat.

1565
02:59:10,520 --> 02:59:13,000
"I do like a crowd."

1566
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:27,720
"He jumped out into the middle of the road right in front of the crowd and waited for the first scream... but there
wasn't one. Everybody was staring up the road. Nobody even noticed the Rat."

1567
02:59:27,720 --> 02:59:30,160
"Look everybody," said the Rat.

1568
02:59:30,160 --> 02:59:33,520
"Over here. Rat. See."

1569
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:39,960
"Nothing happened. The people were all too busy looking up
the road."

1570
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,440
"This is ridiculous," said the Rat.

1571
02:59:42,440 --> 02:59:45,880
"Are you all blind? Can't you see me?"

1572
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:50,920
"Then the Rat saw what the people were looking at."

1573
02:59:50,920 --> 02:59:59,760
"An elephant was coming down the road. Sitting on the
elephant's back and stroking a large white cat rode the
King."

1574
02:59:59,760 --> 03:00:02,000
"Wow," said a man.

1575
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:06,600
"Just look at the size of that elephant!"

1576
03:00:06,600 --> 03:00:09,080
"Never mind the elephant," said the Rat.

1577
03:00:09,120 --> 03:00:12,160
"What about me. Look at me. I'm a scary rat."

1578
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:18,080
"Yes look at its wonderful long trunk," said a woman."

1579
03:00:18,080 --> 03:00:22,000
"That's just its nose," said the Rat.

1580
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:23,640
"I've got a nose."

1581
03:00:23,680 --> 03:00:27,200
"And its huge ears," said a little girl."

1582
03:00:27,200 --> 03:00:32,560
"I've got ears," said the Rat, jumping up and down."

1583
03:00:32,600 --> 03:00:38,280
"But nobody was listening. They were too busy admiring the
enormous elephant."

1584
03:00:38,280 --> 03:00:42,920
"That is the most wonderful creature in the whole world,"
they all said."

1585
03:00:42,920 --> 03:00:47,000
"No...no!" said the Rat.

1586
03:00:47,000 --> 03:01:10,200
"There's nothing wonderful about elephants. How many legs have they got? Four like me. How many eyes have they got?
Two like me. What colour are they? Grey like me. See, I'm exactly the same as an elephant except an elephant's really slow and boring and I'm truly the most fierce and terrifying creature in the world."

1587
03:01:10,200 --> 03:01:15,720
"But nobody noticed the Rat... ...apart from the King's
Cat."

1588
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:23,240
"Look at me...look at me. I'm exactly like an elephant "cept
better.

1589
03:01:23,280 --> 03:01:24,680
Elephant's are rubbish.

1590
03:01:24,680 --> 03:01:26,960
I am the most fierce and..."

1591
03:01:26,960 --> 03:01:30,560
"The Rat didn't finish what he was saying because..."

1592
03:01:30,600 --> 03:01:37,560
"...in an instant the white cat had run down the elephant's
trunk and was staring the Rat in the face."

1593
03:01:37,560 --> 03:01:46,160
"Exactly like an elephant, eh?" said the Cat looking down at
the Rat."

1594
03:01:46,160 --> 03:01:55,080
"Well maybe not exactly," said the Rat looking nervously at
the cat's sharp claws.

1595
03:01:55,080 --> 03:02:03,720
"Obviously my nose isn't quite as long...my ears are a bit
smaller...and I haven't got a king riding on my back…"

1596
03:02:03,720 --> 03:02:10,840
"Suddenly the Cat's paw flashed out and pinned the Rat to
the ground. The Rat couldn't move."

1597
03:02:10,840 --> 03:02:15,640
"Think I could do this to an elephant?" said the Cat."

1598
03:02:15,640 --> 03:02:19,080
"Um...not sure," said the Rat."

1599
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:25,920
"The Cat scooped up the Rat and held him up to her mouth."

1600
03:02:25,920 --> 03:02:30,880
"Think I could do this to an elephant?" said the Cat."

1601
03:02:30,880 --> 03:02:36,360
"No, maybe not," said the Rat shaking in fear."

1602
03:02:36,360 --> 03:02:43,160
"Think I could eat an elephant in two seconds flat?" asked
the Cat."

1603
03:02:43,160 --> 03:02:47,320
"Nope," whispered the Rat."

1604
03:02:47,360 --> 03:02:54,120
"Look what I've found," said the Cat to the people putting
the terrified Rat back down on the ground."

1605
03:02:54,120 --> 03:03:01,600
"The Rat was shaking and looked so small and scared that
people weren't at all frightened of him."

1606
03:03:01,600 --> 03:03:03,440
"What is it?" said a man."

1607
03:03:03,440 --> 03:03:07,440
"Sort of mouse I think," said his wife.

1608
03:03:07,440 --> 03:03:09,760
"Funny little mouse thing probably."

1609
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:23,160
"As he slunk away the Rat heard the Cat say "A rat and an elephant may be the same colour but that doesn't make them
the same size.

1610
03:03:23,160 --> 03:03:24,720
You remember that...

1611
03:03:24,720 --> 03:03:26,480
Mr Rat.""

1612
03:03:26,480 --> 03:03:43,520
"And the Rat did remember that. For ever."

1613
03:03:43,520 --> 03:03:55,440
THE ANT AND THE DOVE

1614
03:03:55,440 --> 03:03:58,040
"It was another hot, dry day in the forest…"

1615
03:03:58,080 --> 03:04:04,960
"Ant had been wandering over crinkly, dry leaves for days in
search of a nice, cool drink…"

1616
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:15,440
"All I need is a drop of rain falling from a leaf – or a tiny pool of dew on a flower petal – or even a muddy
puddle…" he thought.

1617
03:04:15,440 --> 03:04:21,920
But it was so hot all the dew and puddles in the forest had
dried up."

1618
03:04:21,960 --> 03:04:27,320
"I'm so thirsty, that I have no choice," Ant sighed at last.

1619
03:04:27,320 --> 03:04:31,440
"I shall have to go in search of the Roaring River."

1620
03:04:31,440 --> 03:04:43,360
"Ant had been warned about the Roaring River. "It roars and it swirls and if you go too close, it will sweep you away,"
a wise owl had told him."

1621
03:04:43,360 --> 03:04:53,680
"But Ant was desperate. "The river has more drops of water than all the rain clouds in the world," he thought. "It's my
only hope of staying alive.""

1622
03:04:53,720 --> 03:05:03,160
"So Ant headed off. He plodded on and on through the trees,
until finally, he heard rushing water ahead…"

1623
03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:17,600
"Before him lay the Roaring River – as vast as a sea, or so it seemed to tiny Ant. The fast flowing waters looked
frightening – but Ant was too thirsty to feel fear…"

1624
03:05:17,600 --> 03:05:24,280
"He clambered down the river bank and bent his weary head
into the water to drink it up."

1625
03:05:24,280 --> 03:05:32,520
"The cool, sparkling water was so refreshing that Ant didn't
hear a roaring wave coming towards him…"

1626
03:05:32,600 --> 03:05:46,000
"Suddenly, he was flat on his back - his little legs in the air, being swept away by the water! "Help!" he cried.
"Someone save me, please!""

1627
03:05:46,040 --> 03:05:56,280
"All of a sudden, a green leaf dropped onto the water by his side with a plop. "Quick, climb on!" cried a gentle cooing
voice."

1628
03:05:56,320 --> 03:06:04,640
"Ant didn't have time to see who the voice belonged to. He just did what it told him…then he opened his eyes and looked
up."

1629
03:06:04,640 --> 03:06:09,840
"Perching on the branch of a tree above was a pure white
Dove."

1630
03:06:09,880 --> 03:06:18,280
"Stay calm, little Ant - and wait for the gentle breeze to
blow the leaf to the river bank," she cooed."

1631
03:06:18,280 --> 03:06:34,240
"Sure enough, the leaf carried Ant to safety. He looked up – but the Dove had disappeared. "I can't leave without
thanking her," he thought. "So I shall wait until she returns.""

1632
03:06:34,240 --> 03:06:44,760
"Ant waited and waited. Then, just as he was about to fall asleep, he heard strange noises. They were coming closer and
closer…"

1633
03:06:44,760 --> 03:07:08,200
"Two men emerged from the forest and stopped under the Dove's tree. One was carrying a bucket – the other a large,
golden cage. "This is the tree – the home of the most beautiful dove in the land," said the man with the cage. "I hope that glue in your bucket is sticky enough…""

1634
03:07:08,200 --> 03:07:14,280
"Indeed it is," said the second as he covered the branch
with a thick, green paste.

1635
03:07:14,280 --> 03:07:23,120
"When the Dove lands, its feet will stick to the branch – then we can put it in the cage and take it to the King. All
we have to do is hide and wait…"

1636
03:07:23,120 --> 03:07:35,760
"Ant was horrified. "I can't let this happen!" he thought. "But what can a tiny creature like me do against two such
giants of men?""

1637
03:07:35,800 --> 03:07:51,240
"Ant looked up as he heard the flapping of wings. The Dove had returned and was about to land on the sticky branch…!
"If I'm going to act, I must use the only weapon I have…" thought Ant. "And I must do it RIGHT NOW!""

1638
03:07:51,240 --> 03:07:58,440
"So he jumped onto the men's feet – and bit as hard as he
could…time and time again…"

1639
03:07:58,520 --> 03:08:04,000
"Yow!!!" they cried out in pain and took to their heels
through the forest."

1640
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:11,800
"Thank you for saving me from a life in a cage," cooed the
Dove to Ant."

1641
03:08:11,800 --> 03:08:18,560
"And thank you for saving me from the giant wave," replied
Ant."

1642
03:08:18,560 --> 03:08:21,600
THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF

1643
03:08:21,600 --> 03:08:25,440
"A young boy got a job with a shepherd."

1644
03:08:25,440 --> 03:08:41,400
"Just keep your eyes open and look out for wolves" said the
shepherd.

1645
03:08:41,400 --> 03:08:49,000
"Wolves always try to eat my sheep. If you see one, ring
this bell and shout out "Wolf..!

1646
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
Wolf..!"

1647
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,640
Then we'll come running with our guns.

1648
03:08:53,640 --> 03:08:56,000
Can you do that, boy?"

1649
03:08:56,040 --> 03:08:59,280
"Don't you worry Mr Shepherd," said the boy.

1650
03:08:59,280 --> 03:09:01,160
"Your sheep are safe with me.""

1651
03:09:01,160 --> 03:09:06,000
"The boy took the sheep up into the hills and sat down with
his bell."

1652
03:09:06,040 --> 03:09:08,400
"Don't worry sheep," he said.

1653
03:09:08,400 --> 03:09:13,360
"I'm here now. I'm in charge. You'll be safe with me."

1654
03:09:13,360 --> 03:09:23,440
"All morning the boy sat in the grass looking for wolves. "I
expect they're hiding," he said to the sheep."

1655
03:09:23,440 --> 03:09:35,080
"That night the boy took the sheep back to the village. The shepherd counted his sheep and was very pleased. "Well
done," he said. "All safe.

1656
03:09:35,080 --> 03:09:37,480
Same again tomorrow?""

1657
03:09:37,520 --> 03:09:40,600
"Yes sir!" said the boy."

1658
03:09:40,600 --> 03:09:56,040
"The next day was exactly the same as the first day. The boy took the sheep to the hills and sat down with his bell
looking for wolves."

1659
03:09:56,040 --> 03:09:57,840
"There weren't any."

1660
03:09:57,840 --> 03:10:13,560
"The boy noticed that the day felt very long. There was no-one to talk to...except sheep...and the sheep never
talked back...they just ate grass...all day..."

1661
03:10:13,560 --> 03:10:24,720
"By the fifth day the boy was very bored with his job. He
looked up at the mountains. Not a wolf in sight."

1662
03:10:24,720 --> 03:10:30,960
"He looked down at the bell and he thought: "Maybe I could
just pretend there's a wolf.""

1663
03:10:30,960 --> 03:10:42,960
"So he picked up his bell... ...and rang it, shouting "Wolf...wolf... ...hurry...come quickly...there's a big old
wolf coming!""

1664
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:53,280
"Soon he could hear the sound of men running up the hill.
"Where is it?" said the shepherd. "Gone," said the boy."

1665
03:10:53,280 --> 03:10:57,480
"He just ran off." "Well done boy," said the shepherd.

1666
03:10:57,480 --> 03:11:07,840
"You saved my sheep." The other men all patted the boy on the head and said how brave he'd been and what a good job
he'd done.

1667
03:11:07,840 --> 03:11:15,920
The boy felt so proud and pleased with himself that he
almost forgot that he'd made the whole thing up."

1668
03:11:15,920 --> 03:11:31,040
"A few days later he was bored again. "The only good day I had in this job was when I pretended there was a wolf," he
told the sheep. "And I rang my bell and all the men came and told me what a good job I'd done.

1669
03:11:31,080 --> 03:11:32,480
It was brilliant.""

1670
03:11:32,520 --> 03:11:37,880
"He looked at his bell. And that's when he decided to do it
again."

1671
03:11:37,880 --> 03:11:49,480
"He rang, he shouted and again the men came running. "Where
is it?" said the shepherd. "Gone," said the boy. "Ran away."

1672
03:11:49,480 --> 03:11:54,280
This time the men didn't say "well done" and pat him on the
head.

1673
03:11:54,320 --> 03:11:57,800
This time they looked at the boy like they didn't believe
him.

1674
03:11:57,800 --> 03:11:59,800
"There was a wolf, honest," he said.

1675
03:11:59,800 --> 03:12:05,400
The men just walked back to the village without speaking."

1676
03:12:05,400 --> 03:12:13,800
"Now the boy felt really sorry for himself. "They know I
rang my bell when there was no wolf.""

1677
03:12:13,800 --> 03:12:24,680
"Then out of the corner of his eye he saw a movement - a big
grey thing was coming down the hillside heading straight for the sheep."

1678
03:12:24,720 --> 03:12:31,960
"The boy rang his bell and he shouted. "Wolf...wolf...come
quickly... ...there's a wolf!""

1679
03:12:31,960 --> 03:12:37,080
"Down in the village the men heard the bell ring and just
carried on working."

1680
03:12:37,080 --> 03:12:40,040
"Little fool," said the Shepherd.

1681
03:12:40,040 --> 03:12:43,600
"Does he really think we'll fall for that again?"

1682
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:54,320
"The boy kept ringing his bell. There were tears in his eyes as he watched the wolf make a meal of one of the shepherd's
fattest sheep."

1683
03:12:54,360 --> 03:13:01,920
"I rang my bell but nobody came," the boy told the shepherd
that evening."

1684
03:13:01,920 --> 03:13:15,880
"The shepherd nodded "Nobody believes a liar...even when
he's speaking the truth."
