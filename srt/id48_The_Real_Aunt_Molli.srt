CHAPTER ONE
The Real Aunt Molli

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,700
My Aunt Molly is the kindest, sweetest person
on earth.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,860
She may not be the cleverest woman in the
world, but I love her a lot.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:27,160
However, a strange thing happened to Aunt
Molly and now we don't know what to do.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,960
It all started when her husband, Uncle Dalton,
died.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,770
Well, I called him Uncle Dalton but she always
called him 'Dally'.

7
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,370
He was my mother's only brother.

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,850
Aunt Molly really loved him, we all knew that.

9
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,910
Life had been quite difficult for Aunt Molly
when she was a child.

10
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,170
She was poor and her parents had died early
on.

11
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,969
She was left to look after herself.

12
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:01,230
She had never learned to read properly and
left school at an early age.

13
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,270
But she was always cheerful and honest and
never complained about the hard work she did

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,470
to earn her living.

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,890
She worked as a cleaner wherever there was
work to do.

16
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,290
She liked cleaning because she didn't have
to make any difficult decisions.

17
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,900
Aunt Molly didn't like making decisions.

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,250
Perhaps she wasn't used to it.

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,430
I don't know.

20
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:31,100
But everybody liked her and she was never
out of work.

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,780
She met Uncle Dalton when she was working
as a cleaner at the bus station.

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,840
He was a bus driver and it was when he had
just finished for the day that he first saw

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,500
her cleaning the station office.

24
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,860
He fell in love with her as soon as he saw
her.

25
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,360
It was the same for Aunt Molly.

26
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,450
As soon as their eyes met it was love for
both of them.

27
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,159
He soon grew to love her gentleness and she
loved his kind heart and willingness to make

28
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,159
decisions.

29
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,060
They got married two weeks later.

30
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,709
A year after that she gave birth to twin boys.

31
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:13,499
They were my cousins and their names were
Winston and Clement.

32
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:17,419
I was born in the same year two months later.

33
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:19,340
I was called Rufus.

34
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,220
I still am.

35
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,819
Anyway, Uncle Dalton got a better job at die
bus station soon afterwards, and they bought

36
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:26,930
a house near us.

37
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,200
Aunt Molly and Uncle Dalton had a happy marriage.

38
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,529
Uncle Dalton earned the money and Aunt Molly
cooked, cleaned and made the house a wonderful

39
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:39,809
home for her dear Dally and the boys.

40
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:44,809
It would not be quite right to say that Aunt
Molly actually ran the house.

41
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:49,919
In fact, all the big decisions were left to
Uncle Dalton.

42
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,879
But she made sure that everything went smoothly.

43
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,209
Everybody was happy.

44
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,319
I was happy, too, because I liked to play
with my cousins.

45
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:05,099
I also looked forward to the delicious home-made
biscuits Aunt Molly always gave me.

46
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:12,879
My cousins and I were five years old when
Uncle Dalton was run over by a bus at the

47
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,879
station.

48
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,269
It was an accident.

49
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,790
Uncle Dalton didn't know what hit him and
he was killed immediately.

50
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:26,180
Well, I suppose he guessed it was a bus, but
I don't think he had much time to think it

51
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,459
over, if you see what I mean.

52
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:32,620
Anyway, he was dead.

53
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,629
In a way, once Uncle Dalton had died, I think
a part of Aunt Molly died too.

54
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:43,419
She was still a hard worker and remained a
good mother to Winston and Clement.

55
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:49,430
Indeed, the routine of running the house was
something she no longer needed any help with.

56
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:55,199
My parents and Uncle Dalton's parents - my
grandparents - all helped Aunt Molly with

57
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,599
the decision making.

58
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,599
But the cheerfulness that we had come to expect
from her had gone.

59
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:08,980
It was as if all her cheerfulness had died
with Uncle Dalton, her 'dear Dally'.

60
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,219
She got some money from the bus company because
Uncle Dalton had been killed at work.

61
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:19,639
At least she didn't have to leave the twins
in order to earn money.

62
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,069
Life continued.

63
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,090
The twins grew into fine boys.

64
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:32,620
But by the time they were fourteen they wanted
to see a bit more of the world outside their

65
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,620
comfortable home.

66
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,960
Both of them were bright and interested in
the world outside.

67
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Especially Winston.

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,000
They were beginning to get bored with life
at home with all its safe routines.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,729
That's where the trouble really began.

70
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:51,710
Aunt Molly had not really changed since their
father's death.

71
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,490
She had not even learned to read properly.

72
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,529
She never went out and had no outside interests.

73
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:06,210
She spent what free time she had listening
to the radio or watching the television, especially

74
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,139
game shows.

75
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:12,419
The boys, though they loved their mother,
wanted to decide more things for themselves.

76
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,440
And like me, they wanted to go out more.

77
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,349
Aunt Molly, however, just wanted to stay at
home all the time.

78
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:27,819
The boys never went out much with their mother
- whenever they did go out, it was with me

79
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,729
and my parents or with our grandparents.

80
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:34,979
Aunt Molly always stayed at home.

81
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:41,590
It was Winston who thought of taking their
mother to the theatre on her next birthday.

82
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,190
She would be thirty-nine.

83
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,169
The boys planned it all out carefully with
the help of the rest of the family.

84
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:51,840
We were all there, my parents and my grandparents.

85
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:59,819
'I don't think Mum would like to see a Shakespeare
play or anything like that,' said Clement.

86
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:05,620
'But I'm sure that going to see something
would do her good!'

87
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,449
'You're right,' said Gran.

88
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:12,889
'I think your mother should go to see something
she would enjoy.

89
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,699
It would make a nice change for her.

90
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:20,250
Something like those shows she likes on the
television.'

91
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,689
'Gran, you're brilliant!' said Winston.

92
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:31,310
'What about that show on the television with
that hypnotist guy... the Maxwell Marvel Show?

93
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,750
Mum loves that!'"

94
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,620
'What's that all about?' asked Grandpa.

95
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,490
'I don't think I've seen it.'

96
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:44,710
'You must be the only person in the country
who hasn't,' said Clement.

97
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:51,189
'Maxwell Marvel is an expert hypnotist - he
gives people suggestions and orders after

98
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:53,099
he has made them go to sleep.

99
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:58,490
When they wake up they do all kinds of funny
things.

100
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,009
Then, at an order from Maxwell Marvel, they
go to sleep again.

101
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:10,969
When they wake up again, they can't remember
a thing about it.'

102
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:11,969
Grandpa laughed.

103
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:15,330
'I've had a few evenings like that myself.'

104
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,150
Gran looked at him.

105
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,370
'Er... when I was much younger, of course,'
he added quickly.

106
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,520
'Mum would really like to see that show - I
just know it,' said Winston.

107
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,219
'Yes, but how do we get your Mum on a television
show?

108
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:31,819
Won't it be expensive?

109
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,850
How will we get the money?'

110
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,379
I asked.

111
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:38,669
'Relax,' said Winston.

112
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:44,889
'All we have to do is write to the television
company and they'll send us the tickets free

113
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:46,199
- that's where they get their live audiences
from!

114
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:54,319
All we have to do is make sure we let them
know in time for the show.'

115
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,139
We all agreed that this was a great idea.

116
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,400
So we did it.

117
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,030
Aunt Molly, of course, was at first unwilling
to go along with it.

118
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,819
However, we had all made the decision for
her and we wouldn't take no for an answer.

119
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:18,969
In her heart, though, she did not really care
what happened to her, not since her dear Dally

120
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:19,969
had gone.

121
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:27,210
But she went along to please her boys because
she cared deeply for them, and did not want

122
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,139
to disappoint them.

123
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:34,729
The television studio - the place where the
show took place - was not at all what Aunt

124
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,240
Molly imagined it would be like.

125
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,709
She thought it would be like the inside of
a theatre or a cinema.

126
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:42,829
It wasn't.

127
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:45,040
It was full of lighting and sound equipment.

128
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,470
There were all kinds of people around whose
job it was to make sure that everything worked

129
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,470
properly.

130
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,810
The audience itself was smaller than she expected.

131
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:02,870
She could see the star of the show, Maxwell
Marvel, nervously brushing his jacket in full

132
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,250
view of the audience.

133
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,060
'Don't worry, Mum,' said Winston with confidence.

134
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,680
'It's always like this in a television studio.

135
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,920
They're just getting ready for the show.'

136
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,839
Aunt Molly was sitting in the middle of the
second row between the twins.

137
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:26,589
I was there, too, along with Grandpa, who,
from time to time, took little drinks from

138
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:30,110
a small bottle of something he kept in his
pocket.

139
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,110
He was smiling.

140
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,630
Gran had stayed at home.

141
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,030
'Hey, the show's starting,' said Clement.

142
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:44,610
A man came out and told some jokes to make
everybody feel more relaxed.

143
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:50,570
He explained how the show was recorded for
television and what was expected of the audience.

144
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:58,959
Then the lights went down and the opening
music to the show started.

145
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,550
Maxwell Marvel came into the centre of the
studio, full of smiles.

146
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,579
The audience clapped for a long time.

147
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:13,670
Aunt Molly had seen this show many times on
television, so she knew what to expect.

148
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,210
Even so, we could tell that she was getting
excited.

149
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,450
We could see her smiling.

150
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,980
It had been a long time since we had seen
her smile like that.

151
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,949
Then the show began.

152
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:31,949
Maxwell Marvel asked for some people from
the audience to be hypnotised.

153
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:37,440
Quite a few of the audience were willing but
only about ten were chosen.

154
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,339
They came on to the small stage and were immediately
hypnotised by Maxwell.

155
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:51,950
They were told to do the strangest things
- such as behaving like farm animals, or dancing

156
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,110
at a disco, or acting like famous people.

157
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,130
And they did everything they were told to
do!

158
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:07,139
Even the quiet looking ones were persuaded
to do things that looked completely different

159
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,139
from their usual behaviour.

160
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:16,730
Then, at a word or sign from Maxwell, they
became themselves again and couldn't remember

161
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,810
anything about what they had done.

162
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:25,740
Some of them didn't even believe that they
had been hypnotised at all and would only

163
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,040
believe Maxwell after they were shown a video
of what they had been doing.

164
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,120
Everybody loved it.

165
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,029
Including Aunt Molly.

166
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:41,449
The final part of the show came when Maxwell
asked for a last person to come forward.

167
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:45,160
'Here!' shouted Winston.

168
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,029
He was pointing at his mother.

169
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:49,029
'Winston!

170
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:51,410
What are you doing?' she said.

171
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,399
'I can't do that - I'd die of embarrassment!'

172
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,399
'Oh, go on, Mum.

173
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:02,870
Do something different for once,' Clement
whispered loudly.

174
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,200
Grandpa and I were smiling.

175
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,959
Aunt Molly smiled too.

176
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,690
She felt that she couldn't say no after all
the trouble they had taken.

177
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,930
What if she did look silly?

178
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,180
That wouldn't matter.

179
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,600
Nothing mattered now but her boys.

180
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,450
'All right - I'll do it!'

181
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,399
she said.

182
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,970
Aunt Molly, for some reason, was an especially
easy person to hypnotise.

183
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:35,730
As she sat on a chair she 'went to sleep'
to the sound of Maxwell's voice like a baby.

184
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:41,930
We all wondered what hypnotic suggestions
Maxwell would give her.

185
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:48,279
Then Maxwell turned to Winston and said: 'What
suggestions would you like to make, young

186
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,279
man?

187
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,540
I'll tell this lovely lady to do anything
that won't get her into trouble with the police!'

188
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,520
The audience laughed.

189
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,910
The twins whispered to each other, then Winston
spoke.

190
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,910
'Well...

191
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:10,050
Mum's always needed a bit more confidence,
so what could you do to make her more...'

192
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,279
'Decisive said Clement.

193
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,920
'That's it,' said Winston.

194
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:21,060
'More able to make decisions and be more confident
- let her live life to the full!'

195
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:27,399
'Let's see what we can do,' said Maxwell.

196
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,970
He first asked for her name and Grandpa told
him.

197
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,800
Then Maxwell turned to Aunt Molly who was
still fast asleep.

198
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,890
'Now, Molly, you will answer only to my voice,
do you understand?'

199
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:51,129
'I understand,' said Aunt Molly quietly, though
she was still asleep.

200
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:56,620
'You will be a confident woman, full of strength.

201
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,850
Whatever you want to do, you will succeed
in doing.

202
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,470
Nothing is too difficult for you.

203
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,480
Is that clear to you, Molly?' said Maxwell.

204
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,110
Molly said that it was.

205
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:21,399
'When I tell you to open your eyes you will
be that intelligent, confident woman; you

206
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,610
will live life to the full.

207
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:34,709
You will not remember that you have been hypnotised
but you will be a new, confident woman who

208
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,629
will live life to the full.

209
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:47,589
You will continue until I - and only I - tell
you to return to your normal life.

210
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:55,959
Is that understood, Molly?' said Maxwell loudly
and with quite a4ot confidence of his own.

211
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,470
Molly said she understood.

212
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,420
'Now, Molly,' said Maxwell.

213
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,379
'Open your eyes...'

214
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:12,860
But as he said this he suddenly gave a loud
cry and fell at Aunt Molly's feet while holding

215
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,700
on to his tie.

216
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,240
His face had turned grey.

217
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,270
Maxwell Marvel had a heart attack just as
Aunt Molly was opening her eyes.

218
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:29,329
The first thing she saw was Maxwell Marvel
lying at her feet.

219
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:36,250
She turned to the nearest person in the audience
and said, 'Well, don't just sit there, man!

220
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:43,410
This man has obviously had a heart attack
- call for a doctor and an ambulance at once.

221
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,560
He needs immediate attention.'

222
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:55,089
The man did as he was told while Aunt Molly
undid Maxwell's tie and put him in a comfortable

223
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:56,089
position.

224
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:00,529
She acted as if she knew exactly what to do.

225
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:07,720
Help soon arrived and the unconscious Maxwell
was taken away in an ambulance.

226
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,920
A man from the television company spoke to
the audience and explained that, because of

227
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,600
Maxwell Marvel's sudden and unfortunate accident,
the show was at an end.

228
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,550
He said he was very sorry that things had
been cut short in this way.

229
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,319
Somebody behind us called out that it had
been the best part of the show.

230
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:34,600
Grandpa went up to the man who had spoken
to us.

231
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,899
He asked him what they could do to get Aunt
Molly back to normal now that Maxwell Marvel

232
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:41,899
wasn't here.

233
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:44,380
'You heard Maxwell,' the man told him.

234
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,769
'Only his voice can undo the orders.

235
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:52,459
I'm sorry - you'll have to wait until Maxwell
can speak to her himself.'

236
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:59,589
'But what if...' asked Grandpa, '... what
if he doesn't get better?'

237
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:03,470
'Let's all hope that he does,' the man said.

238
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,470
'It's a popular show.

239
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:10,160
Anyway, the order he gave her wasn't so bad
was it?

240
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:18,670
It's not as if he told her to start acting
like a monkey or something!

241
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,631
Don't worry - we'll get in touch.'

242
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:27,830
In the car on the way back home we talked
about what had happened that evening.

243
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:34,370
We had all been surprised, to say the least,
at the way Aunt Molly had behaved when Maxwell

244
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:39,010
Marvel had had his heart attack; she had been
more in control than anybody.

245
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:45,420
It was as if she had known exactly what to
do.

246
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,030
'Nonsense,' said Aunt Molly when we put this
to her.

247
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,500
'just a little common sense.

248
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:57,340
Besides, everything about his condition showed
that his attack was not a serious one.

249
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,660
He should get better soon if he rests for
a while and looks after himself

250
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,420
Was this Aunt Molly talking?

251
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,230
We could hardly believe what we were hearing.

252
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,490
She sounded like a doctor.

253
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,320
'How do you know that, Mum?' asked Winston.

254
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,460
'I heard a radio programme all about looking
after your heart - it described everything

255
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,980
about heart conditions very clearly,' she
answered.

256
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,760
'And when, exactly, did you hear this?' asked
Grandpa.

257
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,630
'Oh, ten years ago while I was cleaning the
carpet.

258
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,180
When Dally was alive.

259
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,640
Bless him,' said Molly with a smile.

260
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,600
The week that followed Aunt Molly's return
home was full of surprises for all of us.

261
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,310
She was not the Molly we all knew.

262
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,550
For a start, she soon discovered that she
could read, after all.

263
00:18:53,550 --> 00:19:00,630
After years of hardly looking at even a newspaper,
she began to read anything she could get her

264
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,660
hands on.

265
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,120
At first it was cheap magazines and love stories.

266
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,290
Then she started on serious newspapers and
Russian novels.

267
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:18,040
During the following weeks she took up painting
and found that she was able to paint beautiful

268
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,360
pictures.

269
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,660
Soon she could paint as well as a professional.

270
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,780
Then her beloved cooking changed.

271
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,870
No longer did she cook simple but delicious
meals.

272
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:39,260
Now she tried Indian, Chinese and Italian
meals which were also, it must be said, delicious.

273
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:48,730
She started to go out to all kinds of places
- museums, art shows, scientific talks given

274
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:54,030
by experts, political meetings - and she took
the twins, too!

275
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:59,520
'You were complaining that we never went out
- we're going out!'

276
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,340
she said to them.

277
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,890
Nobody dared to advise her anymore.

278
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:10,380
'I'm a grown woman - I can do things for myself,
thank you very much!'

279
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,710
she would tell us.

280
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:19,420
Then she came home with Horace, the Professor
of Classics at the university.

281
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,890
He was an expert on ancient Greek and Roman
history.

282
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,150
'Horace has asked me to spend a week in Greece
with him.

283
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,550
We're going to explore the ancient buildings,'
she said.

284
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,200
'But Mum...' began the twins.

285
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,290
'No buts...'

286
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,290
Molly said.

287
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,740
'I'd rather explore an ancient building than
look like one.

288
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:49,320
Besides, Horace is a good-looking man - with
brains, too.

289
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
He likes me.

290
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,000
And I'm still an attractive woman; I could
marry again.

291
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,570
It's about time I started to live life to
the full.

292
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,490
I've stayed at home for too long.'

293
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,300
We were all amazed by this new Aunt Molly.

294
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:10,640
She could, it seemed, do anything she put
her mind to.

295
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,740
And although we loved the old Aunt Molly,
we soon liked this new person who had come

296
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,080
into our lives.

297
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,020
In fact, she was now a lively, funny and thoughtful
woman.

298
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,112
She scared us a little, too, with her burning
wish for improvement.

299
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:37,010
But we all found her very, very easy to like.It
was twelve weeks after Maxwell Marvel hkd

300
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,410
had his heart attack.

301
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:46,810
We had heard nothing from him but we saw on
the television that he had been let out of

302
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,810
hospital.

303
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:54,530
Two days after he left hospital he was found
dead in the bed of his latest twenty-year-old

304
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,250
girlfriend.

305
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,300
He had died of another heart attack.

306
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,150
He was forty-nine.

307
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:07,370
A week after Maxwell Marvel's death, Grandpa
received a letter from the man he had spoken

308
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,800
to at the television studio.

309
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,130
There was a taped message with the letter.

310
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:20,000
On the tape was a recording of Maxwell giving
the order for Aunt Molly to return to what

311
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,380
she had been before.

312
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:28,610
He had recorded the message just before he
left hospital, just before he hurried off

313
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:35,590
to meet his new lover.It has now been a week
since Grandpa got the letter.

314
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,420
We still haven't played the tape to Aunt Molly.

315
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,880
We can't decide what we should do.

316
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,310
We have discovered another person in Aunt
Molly and we love her, too.

317
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,240
She's a new Aunt Molly who has rediscovered
life.

318
00:22:51,240 --> 00:23:03,410
Yet we also love and miss the sweet, kind
lady who The truth is, we don't know which

319
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,450
Aunt Molly is now the real one.

320
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,510
What would happen if we played her the tape?

321
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,870
Would a part of her die once again, as it
had seemed to do when Uncle Dalton died?

322
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:21,820
Would it be right for us to take this new
life away from her?

323
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:30,180
Then, again, perhaps nothing would happen
and she would remain as she is - full of the

324
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,180
love of life.

325
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,290
And which Aunt Molly has the most right to
be here -the old or the new?

326
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,710
Who is the real Aunt Molly?

327
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,570
She and Horace are going off to Greece next
week.

328
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,770
That will give us all time to think things
over.

329
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,800
