00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,779
CHAPTER ONE
Your Skin and Hair

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:13,139
You have skin everywhere on your body.

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,530
Your skin helps you to touch things.

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:24,000
It helps you to know when things are hot or
cold.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,010
Skin stops dirt getting into your body.

6
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:40,680
It stops water getting into your body when
it's rainy and when you swim.

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,949
Hair grows out of your skin.

8
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:51,760
Hair on your arms and legs stands up when
you're cold.

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,850
This stops your body getting too cold.

10
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:04,790
Your skin makes sweat when you're hot.

11
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,340
This stops your body getting too hot.

12
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,010
Protect your body!

13
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:24,750
Wash every day, so you can get dirt and sweat
off your skin and hair.

14
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,360
CHAPTER TWO
Your Bones

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:35,830
There are bones under your skin.

16
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,850
These bones make your skeleton.

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,420
Your skeleton helps you to stand up.

18
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,140
There are joints in your skeleton, too.

19
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,080
Bones meet at joints.

20
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:02,170
Elbows and knees are joints.

21
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,590
Joints help you to move.

22
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:12,230
Knee joints help you to jump and kick.

23
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:20,599
A baby has small bones.

24
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:29,499
Bones grow and they make you big and tall.

25
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:36,599
Your bones stop growing when you are about
20 years old.

26
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:42,359
Then there are 206 bones in your body!

27
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:48,069
Protect your bones!

28
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:56,939
When you ride a skateboard, wear pads to protect
your bones and joints.

29
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:03,670
Wear a helmet to protect your head, too.

30
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:09,529
CHAPTER THREE
Your Muscles

31
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:19,930
What helps your bones and joints to walk,
run, dance, and jump?

32
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,310
Muscles!

33
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:27,359
Muscles pull your bones to move your body.

34
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:32,779
Muscles in your legs help you to ride a bicycle.

35
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:40,120
Muscles in your arms help you to row a boat.

36
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:49,109
There are more than 600 muscles in your body!

37
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:58,959
Running, swimming, dancing, and riding a bicycle
are types of exercise.

38
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:09,609
Exercise makes your muscles, bones, and joints
strong.

39
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:13,379
Your heart is a type of muscle.

40
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:19,019
Exercise makes your heart strong, too.

41
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,080
Protect your body!

42
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,639
Do exercise every day.

43
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,610
What is your favorite type of exercise?

44
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:41,530
CHAPTER FOUR
Your Eyes and Ears

45
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:47,710
Your eyes help you to see the world around
you.

46
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,500
They open and close many times every day.

47
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,970
This is called blinking.

48
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,570
When your eyes blink, they wash dirt out of
your eyes.

49
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:23,669
At night, your eyes close so you can sleep.

50
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:28,729
Your ears help you to listen to music.

51
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:34,120
They help you to listen for cars in the street.

52
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:42,220
Your ears can hear things when you sleep,
too!

53
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,940
Protect your eyes and ears!

54
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:52,259
On sunny days, wear sunglasses to protect
your eyes.

55
00:05:52,259 --> 00:06:01,930
Don't listen to very loud music - it's bad
for your ears.

56
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:10,750
CHAPTER FIVE
Your Nose and Mouth

57
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,740
You breathe through your nose and mouth.

58
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:23,230
Your nose and mouth take air into your body.

59
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:29,110
You breathe about 15 times every minute.

60
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:36,550
After exercise, people breathe fast.

61
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:42,900
They can breathe 40 times every minute!

62
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:49,449
Your nose helps you to smell things.

63
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:55,960
Your mouth helps you to talk and eat.

64
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:03,819
Your teeth bite food so you can eat it.

65
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:10,450
Your body uses food to live and grow.

66
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,490
Protect your teeth!

67
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:23,780
Brush your teeth after breakfast and after
dinner, and don't eat lots of candy.

68
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,660
CHAPTER SIX
Your Brain

69
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:35,690
Do you know how you read these words?

70
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,669
Your brain tells you what your eyes see!

71
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:48,580
Your brain tells you what you see, hear, and
touch.

72
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,110
It tells your muscles when to move.

73
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:00,099
It helps you to write, speak, draw, and do
puzzles.

74
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,620
Your brain is amazing!

75
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,310
Your brain works all day and at night when
you sleep!

76
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:19,550
At night, it makes you breathe and it makes
your heart work.

77
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:28,150
At night, your brain helps you to remember
things that you learn in the day.

78
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,590
Protect your brain!

79
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:37,779
Wear a helmet when you ride a bicycle.

80
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:45,420
CHAPTER SEVEN
Getting Sick

81
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,149
Do you get sick?

82
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:52,610
Germs are things that can make you sick.

83
00:08:52,610 --> 00:09:02,079
Germs can get in your body when you breathe
and when you eat.

84
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:07,550
Germs can get in your mouth from your fingers,
too.

85
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:15,870
Some germs get in your body when you get a
cut in your skin.

86
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,790
Wash your hands with soap and water to get
germs off your fingers.

87
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:32,980
Wash your hands when it's time to eat, after
you go to the toilet, after you touch animals,

88
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,529
and after you play outside.

89
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,260
Stop germs!

90
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,481
There are germs in a sneeze.

91
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:48,500
Catch sneezes in a tissue.

92
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:55,389
Then throw the tissue in a wastebasket.

93
00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:02,250
CHAPTER EIGHT
Protect Your Body

94
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,890
Eat food that's good for you.

95
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:11,290
Good food helps your bones to grow.

96
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,890
It makes you strong, and it stops you getting
sick.

97
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,750
There's lots of water in your body.

98
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:31,320
You lose water when you go to the toilet and
when your body makes sweat.

99
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:38,800
Drink water every day to protect your body.

100
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:48,190
Go to the doctor when you get sick, and go
to the dentist every year.

101
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,529
Do exercise every day.

102
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:58,160
It's good to do exercise and it makes you
happy.

103
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,750
It's good to sleep when you arc tired, too.

104
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,740
It's important to protect your body.

105
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,850
- THE END -
