00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,620
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,420
My first home

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,580
The first place I can remember well was a
pleasant field with a pond of clear water

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,570
in it.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:21,740
Trees made shadows over the pond, and water
plants grew at the deep end.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,430
On one side was another field, and on the
other side we looked over a gate at our master's

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,090
house, which stood by the roadside.

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:42,670
At the top of our field were more tall trees,
and at the bottom was a fast-running stream.

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,960
While I was young, I lived on my mother's
milk, but as soon as I was old enough to eat

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,000
grass, my mother went out to work during the
day and came back in the evening.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,379
There were six other young horses in the field,
although they were older than I was.

12
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,460
We all galloped together round the field,
and had great fun.

13
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,560
But sometimes the others would kick and bite.

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,910
'They are young farm horses and haven't learned
how to behave,' my mother told me.

15
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,630
'You are different.

16
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:32,820
Your father is well known, and your grandfather
twice won the most important race at Newmarket.

17
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,920
Your grandmother was quiet and gentle, and
you have never seen me kick or bite, have

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
you?

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:49,130
I hope you will grow up to be gentle and a
willing worker, and never bite or kick.'

20
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,940
I have never forgotten my mother's advice.

21
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,090
She was a clever and sensible old horse.

22
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:03,360
Her name was Duchess, but our master often
called her Pet.

23
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,099
He was a good, kind man, and my mother loved
him very much.

24
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:14,750
Whenever she saw him at the gate, she trotted
across.

25
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:23,120
He used to pat her and say, 'Well, old Pet,
and how is your little Darkie?'

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,510
I was a dull black colour, so he called me
Darkie.

27
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,500
He sometimes brought a piece of bread for
me, or a carrot for my mother, and I think

28
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,430
we were his favourites.

29
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,980
When I was two years old, something happened
which I have never forgotten.

30
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:51,570
It was early spring, and there was a light
mist over the trees and fields.

31
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:57,910
I and the other young horses were feeding
at the lower end of the field when we heard

32
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,370
the distant cry of dogs.

33
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,300
The oldest among us lifted his head to listen.

34
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:13,129
'There are the hounds!' he said, and immediately
raced off.

35
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:18,569
The rest of us followed him to the top of
the field, where we could see several fields

36
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,440
beyond.

37
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,849
My mother and another old horse were standing
near.

38
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:34,620
'They've found a hare,' said my mother, 'and
if they come this way, we shall see the hunt.'

39
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,220
Soon the dogs were all racing down the field
next to ours, making a loud 'yo-yo-yo-yo!'

40
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,409
sound at the top of their voices.

41
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:53,460
After them came men on horses, some in green
coats, and all galloping as fast as they could.

42
00:03:53,460 --> 00:04:00,470
Suddenly, the dogs became silent and ran around
with their noses to the ground.

43
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:07,120
'They've lost the smell of the hare,' said
the old horse.

44
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,090
'Perhaps it will escape.'

45
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:19,650
But the dogs began their 'yo-yo-yo-yo!' again
and came at full speed towards our field.

46
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:26,900
Just then, a hare, wild with fear, ran towards
the trees.

47
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:34,760
The dogs jumped over the stream and ran across
the field, followed by the huntsmen.

48
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,500
Six or eight jumped their horses over the
stream, close behind the dogs.

49
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:48,060
Before the hare could get away, the dogs were
upon her with wild cries.

50
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,470
We heard a terrible scream, and that was the
end of the hare.

51
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,919
One of the men picked her up and held her
by the leg.

52
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:06,380
She was covered in blood, but all the huntsmen
seemed pleased.

53
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:14,600
I was so greatly surprised that at first,
I did not see what was happening by the stream,

54
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,370
but when I did look, I saw a sad sight.

55
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:27,720
Two fine horses were down, one in the stream
and the other on the grass.

56
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:35,340
One rider, who seemed unhurt, was climbing
out of the water, but the other lay quite

57
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,710
still.

58
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,430
'His neck is broken,' said my mother.

59
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:47,590
'I can't understand why men are so fond of
this sport.

60
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:55,289
They quite often hurt themselves and ruin
good horses, all for one hare that they could

61
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,880
get more easily some other way.

62
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:06,199
But we are only horses, and don't know why
men do these things.'

63
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:13,030
They carried the dead rider to our master's
house, and I heard afterwards that it was

64
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:21,680
George Gordon, the only son of a local landowner,
and a fine young man.

65
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,360
A man from the village came to look at the
black horse on the grass.

66
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,130
The animal was in great pain and one of his
legs was broken.

67
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:40,039
The man began to feel the horse all over,
then he shook his head.

68
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:46,000
Someone ran to our master's house and came
back with a gun.

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,580
Soon after, there was a loud bang and a terrible
cry, then all was still.

70
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,240
The black horse did not move again.

71
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,060
My mother was very unhappy.

72
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,360
'I've known that horse for years,' she said.

73
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,130
'His name was Rob Roy.

74
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,419
He was a good brave horse.'

75
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,740
She never went near that end of the field
again.

76
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:28,250
Not many days after, we heard the church bell
and saw a long, strange black carriage, pulled

77
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,190
by black horses.

78
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:37,590
They were taking the body of young George
Gordon to the churchyard to bury him.

79
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,870
He would never ride again.

80
00:07:40,870 --> 00:08:00,370
I never knew what they did with Rob Roy, but
it was all for one little hare.

81
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:06,020
CHAPTER TWO
Birtwick Park

82
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,740
I was beginning to grow handsome.

83
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,770
My coat was fine and soft, and was a shiny
black.

84
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:23,389
I had one white foot, and a pretty white star
on my forehead.

85
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:29,220
When I was four years old, Mr Gordon came
to look at me.

86
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:37,050
He looked closely at my eyes, my mouth, and
my legs, and then I had to walk and trot and

87
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,650
gallop for him.

88
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:48,340
'When he has been trained,' Mr Gordon said
to my master, 'he will do very well.'

89
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:55,350
My master liked to train his horses himself
before selling them, and the next day my training

90
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,750
began.

91
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:05,260
To train a horse is to teach him to wear a
saddle, and to carry a man, woman or child

92
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,830
on his back.

93
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:16,190
The horse must also learn to wear a collar,
and to stand still when it is put on; then

94
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:24,860
to have a carriage fixed behind him, and to
go fast or slow, whichever his driver wishes.

95
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:31,940
He must never bite or kick or talk to other
horses, and must always do what his master

96
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,269
tells him, however tired or hungry he feels.

97
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:44,260
Like all horses that have grown up, I had
to wear a bit and bridle.

98
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:54,320
A bit is a great piece of cold hard metal,
as thick as a man's finger, which is pushed

99
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,550
into a horse's mouth between his teeth and
over his tongue, with the ends coming out

100
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,490
at the corners.

101
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:12,600
It is held there by straps, which go over
the horse's head, under his neck, round his

102
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,770
nose and under his chin.

103
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:24,610
Reins, which the rider holds, are fastened
to each end of the bit.

104
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:33,890
Slowly, with my master's kind words and gentle
ways, I learned to wear my bit and bridle.

105
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:39,210
Next, there was the saddle.

106
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:47,899
My master put it on my back very gently, then
fixed the straps under my body, speaking quietly

107
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:51,130
to me all the time.

108
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:59,920
Then one morning, he got on my back and rode
me round the field on the soft grass.

109
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,209
He did this every day until I was used to
it.

110
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:12,640
Then he took me to the village where a man
fixed metal shoes on to each hoof.

111
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,460
My feet felt heavy and strange, but I got
used to this, too.

112
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,390
There were more new things to wear.

113
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:31,800
First, a heavy collar on my neck, and a bridle
with great sidepieces against my eyes, called

114
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,390
blinkers.

115
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,870
With these on, I could only see in front of
me.

116
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:47,829
But in time I got used to everything, and
could do my work as well as my mother.

117
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:55,519
For a fortnight, my master sent me to a neighbour's
farm for another kind of training, which was

118
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,640
very useful to me.

119
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:05,589
One field was next to the railway and had
sheep and cows in it, and I was put in among

120
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:06,589
them.

121
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:13,070
I shall never forget the first train that
thundered by, and how I galloped to the far

122
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:18,710
side of the field, trembling with fear at
this terrible noise.

123
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:27,740
But after a few days I cared as little as
the sheep and cows when a train passed by.

124
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:34,510
It was early in May when a man came to take
me away to Mr Gordon's house.

125
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,839
My master said, 'Goodbye, Darkie.

126
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,589
Be a good horse, and always do your best.'

127
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:55,110
I put my nose into his hand and he patted
me kindly, and then I left my first home.

128
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:04,420
Mr Gordon's house, which was called the Hall,
stood in Birtwick Park, near the village.

129
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:12,389
We went into the Park through a large gate,
then trotted along a smooth road between some

130
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:17,019
trees to the house and gardens.

131
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:20,889
Beyond this were the stables.

132
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:25,100
There was room for many horses and carriages.

133
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,790
My stable had four good stalls and a large
window.

134
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,110
It was very pleasant.

135
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:39,300
The first stall was called a loose box, where
a horse is not tied up all the time but is

136
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,040
free to move around, as he likes.

137
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,620
It is a great thing to have a loose box.

138
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,389
The groom put me into it and gave me some
oats.

139
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:56,899
Then he patted me, spoke kindly, and went
away.

140
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:01,959
In the stall next to mine stood a little fat
grey pony.

141
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,510
'Hello,' I said.

142
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,480
'What is your name?'

143
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,730
'Merrylegs,' he said, turning round.

144
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,760
'I'm very handsome.

145
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:22,770
I carry the young ladies on my back, and sometimes
I take Mrs Gordon out in one of the carriages.

146
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,660
Are you going to live next to me in the box?'

147
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,940
'Yes,' I said.

148
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,250
'Then I hope you are well-behaved,' he said.

149
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,310
'I don't like anyone who bites.'

150
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,270
A horse's head looked over from the stall
beyond.

151
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:43,880
It was a tall brown mare, and she did not
look pleased.

152
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,079
'So it's you who has turned me out of my box,'
she said.

153
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:58,339
'I'm sorry,' I said, 'but the man put me in
here, so it is not my fault.

154
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:02,740
I don't want to argue with anyone; I just
wish to live in peace.'

155
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:09,280
Later, Merrylegs told me about the tall brown
mare.

156
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:15,780
'Ginger has a bad habit of biting people,'
he explained.

157
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:25,350
'One day, she bit James in the arm, and Miss
Flora and Miss Jessie, the children, were

158
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,329
afraid to come into the stable after that.

159
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:34,730
If you don't bite, I hope they'll start to
come again.'

160
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:42,260
I told him I never bit anything except grass
and could not understand why Ginger bit people.

161
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:50,050
'No one was ever kind to her before she came
here,' said Merrylegs.

162
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:58,440
'John and James do all they can to please
her, and our master is never unkind.

163
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,509
I'm twelve years old, and I know that there
isn't a better place for a horse all-round

164
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:07,480
the country than this.

165
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,490
John has been here fourteen years and is the
best groom there ever was.

166
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,730
And you never saw a kinder stable boy than
James.

167
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,459
There was no reason for Ginger to bite anyone.

168
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:26,450
It's her own fault that she did not stay in
the box.'

169
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:31,270
The name of the groom was John Manly.

170
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:38,490
The next morning, he got out his brushes and
gave me a good grooming, then put a saddle

171
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,690
on me.

172
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:47,589
He rode me slowly at first, then at a trot,
then at a gallop.

173
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:52,980
As we came back through the Park, we met Mr
and Mrs Gordon.

174
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,570
They stopped and John jumped off.

175
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:02,690
'Well, John, how does he go?' said Mr Gordon.

176
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:07,980
'He's a fine horse, sir,' said John.

177
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,760
'He's fast, but the lightest touch of the
rein will guide him.

178
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,709
They were shooting birds near Highwood, and
a gun went off close by.

179
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:26,439
He pulled up a little, but I just held the
rain and he wasn't frightened at all.

180
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,990
It's my opinion he was never frightened or
beaten when he was young.'

181
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,500
'Good,' said Mr Gordon.

182
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,559
'I'll ride him tomorrow.'

183
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:46,600
I remembered my mother's advice, and the next
day I tried to do exactly what my master wanted

184
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,080
me to do.

185
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:55,250
He was a very good rider, and when he came
home, his wife was waiting for him at the

186
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,730
door.

187
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,070
'How do you like him, my dear?'

188
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,240
she asked.

189
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,020
'I have never ridden a more pleasant horse,'
answered Mr Gordon.

190
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,850
'What shall we call him?'

191
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:18,010
'What about Blackbird like your uncle's old
horse?' said his wife.

192
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:23,080
'He's far handsomer than Blackbird,' said
Mr Gordon.

193
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:32,280
'Yes,' she said, 'he's quite a beauty, and
he has a kind, intelligent face.

194
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,250
Shall we call him Black Beauty?'

195
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:45,820
'Black Beauty - why, yes, I think that's a
very good name,' said Mr Gordon.

196
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,270
John went into the stable and told James.

197
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:58,700
'I'd call him Rob Roy,' said James, 'if it
did not remind everyone of the past.

198
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,950
I never saw two horses more alike.'

199
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,800
'That's not surprising,' said John.

200
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,880
'Didn't you know that Farmer Grey's old Duchess
was the mother of them both?'

201
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,940
So poor Rob Roy who was killed at the hunt
was my brother!

202
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,890
Now I understood why my mother was so unhappy
when he died.

203
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:35,150
John was very proud of me, and seemed to know
just how a horse feels.

204
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,350
And James was kind, too.

205
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:45,030
A day or two later, I went out in the carriage
with Ginger.

206
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:53,870
I wondered how we would get on together, but
I found it easy to trot along beside her.

207
00:19:53,870 --> 00:20:00,500
Merrylegs was a happy little pony and was
everyone's favourite.

208
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:17,960
We were soon great friends and I became quite
happy in my new home.

209
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,740
CHAPTER THREE
Gingers story

210
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,900
What more could I want?

211
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,000
Freedom!

212
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,059
For the first four years of my life, I had
a large field where I could gallop around

213
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:45,240
at full speed - with no straps, no bit, and
no blinkers.

214
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:52,950
Now I stood in a stable, night and day, except
when I was wanted for work, and sometimes

215
00:20:52,950 --> 00:21:01,340
when John took me out, I felt so strong, so
full of life, that I wanted to jump or dance.

216
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:06,600
'Calm down, boy!' he would say.

217
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:15,950
Then, as soon as we were out of the village,
he would let me trot fast for a few miles.

218
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,890
Some grooms punished a horse for getting too
excited, but not John.

219
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:30,480
He knew how to control me with only the sound
of his voice, and I was very fond of him.

220
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,900
Sometimes we did have our freedom in the field
for an hour or two.

221
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:43,100
This was on fine Sundays in the summer, because
the carriage never went out on Sundays.

222
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,490
It was wonderful.

223
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:52,120
The grass was cool and soft to our feet, and
the air was so sweet.

224
00:21:52,120 --> 00:22:00,300
And we could gallop or lie down or roll over
on our backs, or do what we liked.

225
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:07,190
One day Ginger asked me about my old home
and my training.

226
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:14,120
When I finished telling her, she said, 'Life
has been different for me.

227
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,750
I was taken from my mother when I was young,
and there was no kind master like yours to

228
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,130
look after me.

229
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,400
I had a bad time when I was trained.

230
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:35,350
Several men caught me in a corner of the field
and one held my nose so hard that I could

231
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,419
only just breathe.

232
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:44,410
Then another pulled my mouth open to put the
bit in, and I was pulled along and beaten

233
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,940
from behind.

234
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,720
They didn't give me a chance to understand
what they wanted.

235
00:22:51,720 --> 00:23:00,659
'The old master, Mr Ryder, knew about horses,
but he gave up most of the business to his

236
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,480
son, who was tall and strong, but not gentle.

237
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:15,470
They called him Samson, and he said that no
horse could throw him out of the saddle.

238
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:24,210
One day, he made me run round the field on
a long rein until I was very tired and miserable.

239
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:31,919
The next morning he did the same again, then
he put a saddle and bridle on me, and a new

240
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,590
kind of bit into my mouth.

241
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:43,230
'The new bit was very painful and I pulled
away and stood up on my back legs, which made

242
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,850
him very angry.

243
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:52,799
He stayed in the saddle and beat me with a
whip, but after a long and terrible battle,

244
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:58,520
I threw him off and galloped to the other
end of the field.

245
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:07,570
'I watched him go into the stable, but no
one came to fetch me.

246
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:12,750
Time went on and the sun was very hot.

247
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,810
I was hungry and very thirsty.

248
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:25,540
At last, just as the sun was going down, the
old master came out with some oats.

249
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:33,929
He spoke kindly and held out the oats for
me to eat, then patted me gently and looked

250
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:38,059
at the blood on my sides where Samson had
whipped me.

251
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:44,310
'"Poor girl!" he said, then led me to the
stable.

252
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,230
Samson was there.

253
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,560
"Keep out of the way," said the master.

254
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,710
"You've done a bad day's work for this horse
with your bad temper.

255
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:03,530
A bad-tempered man will never make a good-tempered
horse."

256
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:09,730
He led me into my box and took off my saddle
and bridle.

257
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:16,679
Then he called for some warm water and gently
cleaned the blood from my sides.

258
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:27,610
'After that, he often came to see me, but
a man called Joe went on training me.

259
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:33,140
He was quiet and thoughtful and I soon learned
what he wanted.

260
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:41,799
'After my training,' Ginger went on, 'I was
bought by a dealer to match another horse

261
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:44,850
of my colour.

262
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:52,720
But then we were sold to a man in London who
drove us with a bearing rein - a rein to hold

263
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,400
our heads up unnaturally high and to keep
them there, for hours and hours, until the

264
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,110
pain was terrible.

265
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:11,409
We had to wear two bits instead of one, and
mine was so sharp that it made my mouth bleed.

266
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:18,390
Sometimes we waited for hours while our master
or mistress was at parties or the theatre,

267
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:24,030
and if we weren't patient, the driver would
whip us.'

268
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,260
'Didn't your master care about you at all?'

269
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,340
I said.

270
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,179
'Only about how we looked,' replied Ginger.

271
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:36,140
'He knew very little about horses.

272
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:43,780
The driver told him I had a bad temper but
would soon get used to the bearing rein.

273
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:50,620
I was willing to work and learn, but they
were so cruel that it made me angry.

274
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:58,000
Then I broke away from the carriage one day,
and that was the end of that place.

275
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:06,230
'I was sold to another man, but he had a groom
as bad- tempered as Samson.

276
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,920
He hit me across the legs with his stable
brush if I didn't move quickly.

277
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:18,429
I hated him, and one day when he made me angry,
I bit him!

278
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:24,800
He never came into my stall after that, and
I was soon sold again.

279
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:31,919
'A dealer heard of me and said he thought
he knew one place where I should do well.

280
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:38,460
"It's wrong for a fine horse to go bad like
that," he said.

281
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:44,649
And I was brought here, not long before you
came.

282
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:49,110
Of course, it's very different here.

283
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,850
But who knows how long it will last?

284
00:27:52,850 --> 00:28:00,640
I've decided that all men are my natural enemies.'

285
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:09,990
I was sorry for Ginger, but as the weeks went
on, she became happier and more gentle.

286
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:19,419
'I do believe Ginger is getting quite fond
of me,' James said one day.

287
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:25,600
'She'll be as good as Black Beauty one day,'
replied John.

288
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:35,529
'Kindness is all she needs, poor thing!'

289
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:45,919
CHAPTER FOUR
Kindness and cruelty

290
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:58,570
A neighbour of the Gordons', Mr Blomefield,
had a large family of boys and girls who often

291
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:03,799
came to play with Miss Jessie and Miss Flora.

292
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:10,840
One of the girls was the same age as Miss
Jessie, two of the boys were older, and there

293
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,279
were several little ones.

294
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:20,840
Whenever they came, the children loved to
ride Merrylegs.

295
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:27,700
One afternoon when they were visiting, James
brought Merrylegs in and said, 'Now, behave

296
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,700
yourself.'

297
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,669
'What did you do, Merrylegs?'

298
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:34,980
I asked him.

299
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:43,110
'Those young people didn't seem to know when
I was tired,' he said, 'so I just threw them

300
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,110
off backwards.

301
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,960
It was the only thing they could understand.'

302
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,590
'You threw the children off!'

303
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,029
I said.

304
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,480
'Oh, no!

305
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,679
Did you throw Miss Flora or Miss Jessie?'

306
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:59,740
'No, of course not!

307
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,920
I'm quiet and careful with them, and with
the little ones.

308
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,789
I'm the best friend and riding teacher those
children have.

309
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:14,020
It's not them, it's the boys,' he said.

310
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:21,640
'The other children rode me for nearly two
hours, then the boys rode me, one after the

311
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,549
other, for an hour, hitting me with a stick.

312
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:34,480
I didn't get annoyed but I did get tired,
so I stopped once or twice to let them know.

313
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:42,659
But boys think a horse is like a machine and
can go on as long and as fast as they want

314
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:43,820
it to.

315
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,580
They never think that we get tired.

316
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:56,049
As one was whipping me, I stood up on my back
legs and he fell off.

317
00:30:56,049 --> 00:31:00,640
He got on again and I did the same.

318
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,909
Then the other boy tried and I put him down
on the grass.

319
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:14,090
They're not bad boys, and don't mean to be
cruel, but they have to learn.

320
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:22,049
'When they told James, he was angry to see
those big sticks and told the boys not to

321
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,370
use them again.'

322
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:29,770
'I would give those boys a good kick,' said
Ginger.

323
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,419
'I know you would,' said Merrylegs.

324
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:40,950
'But they expect me to look after those children,
and they expect me to be good- tempered, and

325
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,289
I will be.

326
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:49,769
You never had a place where they were kind
to you, Ginger, and I'm sorry for you.

327
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:56,740
But good places make good horses, and I wouldn't
make our people angry for anything!

328
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:06,020
If I started kicking people, they would very
quickly sell me, perhaps to someone cruel.

329
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,529
I hope that never happens.'

330
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:18,820
I often wondered why Sir Oliver, the oldest
horse in the stable, had so short a tail - only

331
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:27,429
about twenty centimetres long - and one day
I asked him, 'Did you have an accident?'

332
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:31,770
'It was no accident!' he said, angrily.

333
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:38,690
'My long and beautiful tail was cut off when
I was a young horse.

334
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,590
At that time, some owners thought it was fashionable!'

335
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,519
'How terrible!'

336
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,440
I said.

337
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,100
'Yes, terrible and cruel,' said Sir Oliver.

338
00:32:52,100 --> 00:33:02,410
'Now I can never brush the flies off my sides
or back legs, and all because of fashion.

339
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:09,970
Some owners cut off the tails of their dogs
to make them look brave, or cut their pretty

340
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:14,950
little ears to make them look fashionable.

341
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,830
They don't cut off the ends of their children's
ears, do they?

342
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:25,910
Why do they think it's all right to do these
things to their animals?'

343
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:34,770
Mr Gordon was never cruel, and he would not
stand by and watch others be cruel to animals.

344
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:42,799
We were riding home one morning when we saw
a big man driving towards us in a small carriage,

345
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,000
pulled by a beautiful little pony.

346
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,519
As he got to the Park gates, the pony turned
towards them.

347
00:33:53,519 --> 00:34:00,149
Without warning, the man pulled the pony's
head round so roughly that the little animal

348
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:03,159
almost fell over.

349
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:07,270
Then he began to whip the pony, angrily.

350
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:15,129
The animal tried to move forward, but the
man held it back and continued to whip it.

351
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:17,060
'Sawyer!'

352
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,139
shouted my master.

353
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,530
The man looked up.

354
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:28,050
He was a builder who often came to the Park
to do work.

355
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:33,869
'He's too fond of going his own way!' he told
my master.

356
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:40,960
'He's not supposed to turn in through your
gates; the road is straight on.'

357
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,680
'You often drive that pony to my house,' said
my master.

358
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:52,520
'It only shows that the horse is intelligent
and remembers these things.

359
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,810
How could he know you weren't going there
today?

360
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:02,970
I've never seen a horse beaten so cruelly
or with so much anger.

361
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:06,570
What will people think of you, Sawyer?

362
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:14,800
As well as hurting the horse, you hurt your
own good name - do you want people to think

363
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,349
of you as a cruel, bad- tempered man?'

364
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:27,800
We went home slowly, and I could tell by his
voice that the master was unhappy at what

365
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:42,570
we had seen.

366
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:49,400
CHAPTER FIVE
The storm

367
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:57,170
One day in the autumn, my master had to go
to a distant town on business.

368
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:02,390
John harnessed me to the carriage and the
three of us went off.

369
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:10,280
There had been a lot of rain, and the wind
was very strong.

370
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:18,520
When we came to the river, the water was so
high it nearly reached the wooden bridge,

371
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,560
and many of the fields were under water.

372
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:31,089
In one low part of the road, the water was
half-way up to my knees.

373
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:37,700
We got to the town and the master's business
took a long time.

374
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:43,210
It was late in the afternoon when we started
back for home.

375
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:52,760
The wind was much stronger, and as we drove
through a wood, I heard my master say, 'I've

376
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,180
never been out in a storm as bad as this,
John.'

377
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:05,980
Indeed, I thought so too, hearing the terrible
noise of that wild wind in the trees.

378
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:11,930
'I wish we were out of this wood,' said my
master.

379
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,760
'Yes, sir,' agreed John.

380
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,280
'We don't want one of those branches coming
down on top of us.'

381
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,859
But just as he finished speaking, there was
a great noise of wood breaking, and a big

382
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:34,260
tree came crashing down through the other
smaller trees and fell across the road right

383
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,930
in front of us!

384
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:47,520
I was very frightened and I stopped immediately,
but I didn't turn round or try to run away.

385
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,320
John jumped out and quickly ran to my side.

386
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,240
'What can we do now, John?' said my master.

387
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:06,430
'We can't drive over the tree or get round
it, sir,' said John.

388
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:12,740
'We'll have to go back to the crossroads,
and take the longer road round to the wooden

389
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,590
bridge.

390
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:20,710
It will make us late, but the horse isn't
tired.'

391
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,410
It was nearly dark when we got to the wooden
bridge.

392
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:31,339
We could see water over the middle of it,
but this often happened when the river was

393
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:33,630
high.

394
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:41,790
But the moment my feet touched the first part
of the bridge, I was sure something was wrong,

395
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,430
and I stopped suddenly.

396
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:51,829
'Go on, Beauty,' said my master, and he touched
me with the whip.

397
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:58,850
I did not move, so he hit me sharply, but
I would not go forward.

398
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:06,830
'There's something wrong,' said John, and
he jumped from the carriage and began to look

399
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,220
round.

400
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,260
He tried to lead me forward.

401
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:17,510
'Come on, Beauty, what's the matter?'

402
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:25,680
Of course, I could not tell him, but I knew
the bridge was not safe.

403
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,290
Just then, a man ran out of the house on the
other side of the bridge.

404
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,570
'Stop!'

405
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,020
Stop!' he cried.

406
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,339
'What's the matter?'

407
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:39,630
shouted my master.

408
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:48,370
'The bridge is broken in the middle,' said
the man, 'and part of it was carried away.

409
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:52,380
If you come across, you'll fall in the river!'

410
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,400
'Thank you, Beauty!'

411
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:04,560
John said to me, and turned me gently round
to the right-hand road by the riverside.

412
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,770
It got darker and the wind got quieter as
I trotted towards home by another, much longer

413
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,260
road.

414
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:20,210
The two men were quiet for some time, but
then my master spoke.

415
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:27,670
'We were very close to drowning in that river,
John,' he said.

416
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:35,040
'Men may be clever enough to think of things
for themselves, but animals know things without

417
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:43,590
thinking, and that's often saved a man's life,
as it has ours tonight.

418
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:49,700
People don't realize how wonderful their animals
are, nor do they make friends with them as

419
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,829
they should.'

420
00:40:53,829 --> 00:41:00,510
When we arrived back at Birtwick Park, the
mistress ran out to meet us.

421
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,850
'I've been so worried!'

422
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:03,850
she said.

423
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,510
'Are you all right?

424
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,160
Did you have an accident?'

425
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,030
'We nearly did,' said my master.

426
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:23,640
'But Black Beauty was cleverer than we were,
and saved us all from drowning!'

427
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:31,570
One morning early in December, the master
came to the stable with a letter in his hand,

428
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,800
looking very serious.

429
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,250
'Good morning, John,' he said.

430
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:46,860
'Tell me, does James work hard and do what
you tell him to do?'

431
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:51,349
'Yes, sir, always,' replied John.

432
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:56,220
'And he doesn't stop work when your back is
turned?'

433
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,119
'Never, sir.'

434
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:06,800
'And if he goes out with the horses, does
he stop to talk to friends, or go into houses

435
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,140
where he has no business, leaving the horses
outside?' said the master.

436
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,670
'No, sir,' said John.

437
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:22,180
'And if anybody has said that about James,
I don't believe it.

438
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:28,890
I never had a pleasanter, more honest young
man in this stable.'

439
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:36,619
The master smiled and looked across at James,
who was standing by the door.

440
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:44,430
'James, I'm glad John's opinion of you agrees
with my own,' he said.

441
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:49,819
'I've had a letter from my wife's brother,
Sir Clifford Williams.

442
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:56,680
He wants me to find him an honest young groom
who knows what he's doing.

443
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:04,190
The man who drives his carriage is getting
old and needs a young man who will work with

444
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,750
him and be able to do his job one day.

445
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,600
How old are you?'

446
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,859
'Nineteen next May, sir,' said James.

447
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,770
'That's young.

448
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,700
What do you think, John?'

449
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:28,820
'It is young, sir,' said John, 'but he's tall
and strong.

450
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:36,160
He doesn't have much experience of driving,
but he has a light touch and a quick eye.'

451
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:45,280
'Well, James,' said the master, 'talk to your
mother at dinner-time and let me know what

452
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,990
you want to do.'

453
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:56,000
A few days later, it was agreed that James
would go to Clifford Hall in a month or six

454
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,180
weeks, and for the next few weeks, he drove
the carriage.

455
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:10,830
We went in and out of town, through busy streets,
and to the railway station, where the road

456
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:17,380
was narrow and there were lots of other carriages
hurrying to and from the station.

457
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:24,980
Then my master and mistress decided to visit
some friends who lived about seventy-five

458
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,260
kilometres from our home.

459
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:45,800
'You can drive us, James,' said my master.

460
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,390
CHAPTER SIX
The fire

461
00:44:51,390 --> 00:45:00,510
The first day we travelled about fifty kilometres,
but James drove carefully and made sure that

462
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:06,890
Ginger and I were always on the smoothest
part of the road.

463
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:13,980
It was evening when we reached the hotel where
we were going to stay that night.

464
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:21,080
It was in the Market Place and two stablemen
came out to us.

465
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:28,880
The chief stableman was a pleasant old man,
and he led me into a long stable with six

466
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,340
or eight stalls in it, and two or three horses.

467
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:40,830
The younger man brought in Ginger, and James
watched while we were groomed.

468
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:49,100
'I thought I was quick,' James told the old
stableman, 'but you're quicker than anyone.'

469
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:59,650
'I've worked with horses since I was twelve
years old, and I can tell you it's good to

470
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:06,900
be able to work with a well- behaved, well-cared
for animal like this,' said the stableman,

471
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,250
patting my neck.

472
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,270
'Who is your master?'

473
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:16,330
'Mr Gordon of Birtwick Park,' said James.

474
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:21,589
'I've heard of him,' said the stableman.

475
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:27,910
'He's a good judge of horses, and the best
rider in this part of the country.'

476
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:37,380
'He doesn't ride very often now,' said James,
'not since the poor young master was killed.'

477
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:43,340
'I read about that in the newspaper,' said
the stableman.

478
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:48,550
'A fine horse was killed too, wasn't it?'

479
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:53,210
'Yes, an excellent horse,' said James.

480
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:59,080
'He was the brother of this one, and just
like him.'

481
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,420
'Terrible!' said the old man.

482
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:07,010
'It was a bad place to jump, wasn't it?

483
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:15,720
A man's life and a horse's life are worth
more than a hare - or they should be!'

484
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:21,940
Later that evening, the younger stableman
brought in another horse, and a young man

485
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:28,059
with a pipe in his mouth came into the stable
to talk to him.

486
00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:38,880
'Towler, go up and get some hay and put it
down for this horse, will you?' said the stableman.

487
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,650
'But put down your pipe first.'

488
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:50,890
'All right,' said the other man, and went
up a ladder and through a little door.

489
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:57,240
I heard him step across the floor over my
head and push down some hay through a hole

490
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:03,880
in the roof, into the new horse's feeding
place.

491
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:12,150
James came in to look at us before he went
to bed, and then the door was locked.

492
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:19,880
I don't know how long I slept, or what time
it was when I woke up, but the air seemed

493
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:26,859
thick and I heard Ginger and another horse
moving about worriedly.

494
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:30,960
It was quite dark and I could see nothing.

495
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,360
The stable was full of smoke, and it was almost
impossible to breathe.

496
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:43,910
The smoke seemed to come from the little door
above me, and I could hear a strange noise

497
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,430
up there.

498
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:52,950
The other horses were now all awake, moving
about restlessly.

499
00:48:52,950 --> 00:49:01,700
At last, I heard someone outside, and then
the younger stableman ran in with a light.

500
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:07,980
He began to untie the horses, and tried to
lead them out.

501
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:15,530
The first horse would not go with him, nor
the second or third.

502
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:24,670
He tried to pull me out, but he was so frightened
himself that he frightened me, and I would

503
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,089
not move.

504
00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:34,700
The noise above was louder now and there was
a shout of 'Fire!'

505
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,940
outside.

506
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:46,940
The old stableman came in quietly and quickly
and got one horse out, then another.

507
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:54,960
By now, the flames were coming down through
the roof and the noise was terrible.

508
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,890
Then I heard James's voice, quiet and friendly
as it always was.

509
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:10,780
'Come on, Beauty,' he said, 'we'll soon get
you out of this smoke.'

510
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:18,710
He took off his scarf and tied it over my
eyes, then led me out, patting me all the

511
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,400
time.

512
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:29,700
He took the scarf off, then shouted, 'Take
this horse, somebody, while I go back for

513
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,400
the other!'

514
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:39,190
Windows in the hotel were open and people
were shouting.

515
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:45,980
I watched the stable door, where the smoke
came out thicker than ever.

516
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:52,980
Then I heard one voice above all the others,
and recognized it as my master's.

517
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,180
'James Howard!

518
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,110
James Howard!

519
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:01,030
Are you there?'

520
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:09,790
There was no answer, only the crash of something
falling in the stable - but the next moment

521
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:15,770
I saw James coming through the smoke, leading
Ginger with him.

522
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:20,210
'My brave boy!' said the master.

523
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:23,230
'Are you hurt?'

524
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:29,540
James shook his head, unable to speak because
of the smoke.

525
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:36,690
Suddenly, I heard the sound of wheels and
galloping horses.

526
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,380
'It's the fire-engine!'

527
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,010
shouted someone.

528
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:47,190
Two horses ran past me, pulling the heavy
fire engine.

529
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:53,819
The firemen jumped out, and we went quickly
into the wide, quiet Market Place, out of

530
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,280
their way.

531
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:03,470
The master led us to a large hotel on the
other side where a stableman came to take

532
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:10,980
us in; then the master hurried off to find
his wife.

533
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:18,309
The next morning, he came to see how we were
and to speak to James.

534
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:28,980
I did not hear much, but James looked very
happy and the master looked proud of him.

535
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,410
How did the fire start?

536
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:38,540
Someone said they saw Dick Towler go into
the stable smoking a pipe, but that when Dick

537
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:42,569
came out he didn't have it.

538
00:52:42,569 --> 00:52:50,930
The young stableman said that he asked Dick
to go up the ladder to put down some hay,

539
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:55,599
but also told him to put down his pipe first.

540
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:02,520
Dick said that he did this, but nobody believed
him.

541
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:10,790
James said the roof and floor had all fallen
in and only the black walls were standing;

542
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:29,599
the two poor horses who could not get out
were buried under the fallen roof.

543
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,609
CHAPTER SEVEN
Joe Green

544
00:53:35,609 --> 00:53:42,880
The rest of our journey was very easy, and
the next evening we reached the house of our

545
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:50,109
master's friend, where a groom took us to
a comfortable stable.

546
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:56,270
We stayed two or three days, then returned
home.

547
00:53:56,270 --> 00:54:02,250
John was glad to see us, and we were glad
to see him.

548
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:08,900
'I wonder who will come in my place,' said
James.

549
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:14,410
'Little Joe Green,' said John.

550
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:21,940
'He's only fourteen and a half but he has
a kind heart and wants to come, so I've agreed

551
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:26,270
to try him for six weeks.'

552
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:33,609
The next day, Joe Green came to learn all
he could before James left.

553
00:54:33,609 --> 00:54:40,740
He was a nice happy boy and always came to
work singing.

554
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:46,849
But then the day came when James had to leave
us.

555
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:52,049
'I'm leaving a lot behind,' he said sadly
to John.

556
00:54:52,049 --> 00:55:00,780
'My mother, and you, a good master and mistress,
and the horses.

557
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,440
And I shan't know anybody at the new place.'

558
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:11,490
'It's hard to leave your home for the first
time,' said John, 'but if you get on well

559
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:20,370
- which I'm sure you will - your mother will
be proud of you.'

560
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:27,589
Everyone was sorry to lose James, but Joe
tried hard to learn, and John was pleased

561
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:32,020
with him.

562
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:38,720
One night I woke up to hear the stable bell
ringing loudly.

563
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:45,840
I heard the door open at John's house, and
his feet running up to the Hall.

564
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,580
He was back quickly.

565
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:53,410
'Wake up, Beauty!' he said, coming into the
stable.

566
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:57,859
'We must go quickly now!'

567
00:55:57,859 --> 00:56:06,030
And before I could think, he had the saddle
on my back and the bridle on my head.

568
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:12,859
The master was waiting at the Hall door with
a letter in his hand.

569
00:56:12,859 --> 00:56:15,640
'Ride for your life, John!' he said.

570
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:23,740
'Give this to Dr White, then rest your horse
and be back as soon as you can.

571
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:28,059
Mrs Gordon is very ill.'

572
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:35,760
Away went John and I, through the Park, through
the village, and down the hill.

573
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:44,690
There was a long piece of flat road by the
riverside, and John said, 'Now Beauty, do

574
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,440
your best!'

575
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:57,420
I needed no whip, and for two miles, I galloped
as fast as I could - perhaps even faster than

576
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:03,420
my grandfather, who won the race at Newmarket.

577
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:10,200
When we came to the bridge, John slowed me
down a little and patted my neck.

578
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:16,640
'Well done, Beauty!' he said.

579
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,710
Then I was off again, as fast as before.

580
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:29,410
The air was cold and the moon was bright,
and it was a pleasant night.

581
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:38,020
We went through a village, then a dark wood,
then uphill, then downhill, and after twelve

582
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:43,400
kilometres, we came to the town.

583
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:49,000
It was three o'clock when we stopped by Dr
White's door.

584
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,150
John rang the bell, then knocked on the door
like thunder.

585
00:57:54,150 --> 00:58:00,190
A window was pushed up and Dr White's head
appeared.

586
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:04,380
'What do you want?' he said.

587
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:10,119
'Mrs Gordon is very ill,' said John.

588
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:14,349
'You must come at once, or she'll die.

589
00:58:14,349 --> 00:58:17,900
Here's a letter.'

590
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,290
The doctor was soon at the door.

591
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:25,480
'My horse has been out all day and is exhausted.

592
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,280
Can I take yours?'

593
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:37,910
'My master told me to rest him,' said John,
'but take him if you think it's best, sir.'

594
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:43,010
'I'll soon be ready,' said the doctor.

595
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:46,800
John stood by me and patted my neck.

596
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:50,440
I was very hot.

597
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:55,089
Then the doctor came out with his riding whip.

598
00:58:55,089 --> 00:58:58,750
'You won't need that, sir,' said John.

599
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:04,230
'Black Beauty will go until he drops.'

600
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:14,280
The doctor was a heavier man than John, and
not so good a rider, but I did my very best.

601
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:20,650
Joe was waiting at the gate and the master
was at the Hall door.

602
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:23,809
He did not say a word.

603
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:31,540
The doctor went into the house with him, and
Joe led me to the stable.

604
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:38,849
My legs were shaking and there was not a dry
hair on my body.

605
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:44,320
The water ran down my legs and I was hot all
over.

606
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,400
Poor Joe!

607
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,230
He was young and knew very little.

608
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:58,980
He did the best he could, cleaning my legs
and my chest, but he did not put a warm cloth

609
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:06,390
on me; he thought I was so hot that I would
not like it.

610
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:15,880
He gave me some cold water to drink, then
he gave me some food and went away.

611
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:24,050
Soon I began to shake and tremble with cold,
and I ached all over.

612
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:34,309
I wished John was there, but he had twelve
kilometres to walk, so I tried to sleep.

613
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:39,910
After a long time, I heard John at the door.

614
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:47,480
I gave a low cry, and he was at my side in
a moment.

615
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:54,100
I could not tell him how I felt, but he seemed
to know immediately.

616
01:00:54,100 --> 01:01:01,130
He covered me with three warm cloths, then
ran for some hot water and made me a warm

617
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:04,190
drink.

618
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:07,210
John seemed very angry.

619
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:14,310
'Stupid boy!' he said to himself, over and
over again.

620
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:20,690
'No cloth put on, and I suppose the water
was cold too.

621
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:24,579
Boys are no good!'

622
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:32,359
I became very ill, and could not breathe without
pain.

623
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:39,339
John looked after me day and night, and my
master often came to see me too.

624
01:01:39,339 --> 01:01:44,750
'My poor Beauty,' he said one day.

625
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:50,849
'My good horse, you saved your mistress's
life.

626
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:55,839
Yes, you saved her life.'

627
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:59,510
I was very glad to hear that.

628
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:07,180
John told my master that he never saw a horse
go so fast.

629
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:16,789
One night, Tom Green, Joe's father, came to
help John give me my medicine, then stayed

630
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:18,190
for a while.

631
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:31,730
At first, both men were silent, then Tom said,
'John, please say a kind word to Joe.

632
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:40,440
The boy is heart-broken; he can't eat his
meals, and he can't smile.

633
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:47,220
He knows it's his fault Beauty is ill, but
he did his best.

634
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:54,030
He says if Beauty dies, no one will ever speak
to him again.

635
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:58,680
But he's not a bad boy.'

636
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:08,630
After a short pause, John said, 'I know he
meant no harm, but I'm proud of that horse,

637
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:14,670
and I hate to think his life may be thrown
away like this.

638
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:23,140
But I'll give the boy a kind word tomorrow,
if Beauty is better.'

639
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:32,220
I heard no more of this conversation, as the
medicine did well and sent me to sleep, and

640
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:38,010
in the morning, I felt much better.

641
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:45,609
Joe learned quickly after this, and was so
careful that John began to give him many things

642
01:03:45,609 --> 01:03:48,480
to do.

643
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:55,890
One day, John was out and the master wanted
a letter taken immediately to a gentleman's

644
01:03:55,890 --> 01:04:00,320
house about five kilometres away.

645
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:05,119
He told Joe to saddle me and take it.

646
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:11,490
The letter was delivered and we were returning
through a field where we saw a cart full of

647
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:14,020
bricks.

648
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:20,420
They were so heavy that the wheels of the
cart were half-buried in the soft ground,

649
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:24,570
and the horses could not move the cart at
all.

650
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:30,650
The man leading the horses was shouting and
whipping them without stopping.

651
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:36,619
'Don't whip the horses like that,' Joe shouted
at him.

652
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:41,520
'The wheels are half-buried and won't move.

653
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:46,610
I'll help you take some bricks out to make
the cart lighter.'

654
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:53,359
'Mind your own business!' said the man angrily.

655
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:59,500
He was in a terrible temper and more than
half-drunk.

656
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:06,859
Joe turned me, and we galloped towards the
house of the brick maker, Mr Clay.

657
01:05:06,859 --> 01:05:09,740
Joe knocked on the door.

658
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,690
The door opened.

659
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:16,349
'Hallo, young man,' began Mr Clay.

660
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:23,039
'There's a man in your field whipping two
horses to death!'

661
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,089
Joe told him, his voice shaking with anger.

662
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:32,109
'I told him to stop, but he wouldn't.

663
01:05:32,109 --> 01:05:37,650
I offered to help him lighten the cart, but
he refused.

664
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:39,789
I think he's drunk.

665
01:05:39,789 --> 01:05:42,630
Please go, sir!'

666
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:49,190
'I will!' said the man, and hurried off.

667
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:54,040
When we got home, Joe told John all about
it.

668
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:58,180
'You did the right thing,' said John.

669
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:04,960
'Many people would ride by and say it was
none of their business.

670
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:10,049
But cruelty is everybody's business.'

671
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:15,140
Just before dinner, the master sent for Joe.

672
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:22,190
The drunken man was accused of cruelty to
horses and Joe was wanted to tell his story

673
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:24,950
to the police.

674
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:29,869
'I'll tell it gladly,' said Joe.

675
01:06:29,869 --> 01:06:37,660
We heard afterwards that the poor horses were
so exhausted and so badly beaten that the

676
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:41,470
man might have to go to prison.

677
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:45,810
Joe came across and gave me a friendly pat.

678
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:53,000
'We won't allow cruelty, will we, old friend?'
he said.

679
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:07,400
And he seemed to have grown up suddenly.

680
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,590
CHAPTER EIGHT
Earlshall Park

681
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:21,660
I lived at Birtwick Park for three happy years,
but then changes came.

682
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:28,440
Our mistress was often ill and the doctor
advised her to go and live in a warm country

683
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,170
for two or three years.

684
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:41,570
Everyone was very sorry, but the master immediately
started making arrangements to leave England.

685
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:50,619
John did his work silently and sadly, and
Joe didn't sing any more.

686
01:07:50,619 --> 01:07:59,559
Then we heard that the master had sold Ginger
and me to an old friend of his, Lord Gray.

687
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:09,470
Merrylegs was given to the neighbour, Mr Blomefield,
and Joe was employed to look after him.

688
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:16,440
John was offered several good jobs but he
wanted to wait and look around.

689
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:22,699
'I want to train young horses,' he told the
master.

690
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:30,550
'I cannot think of anyone more suitable for
that work than you, John,' said the master.

691
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:36,569
'If I can help you in any way, write to me.'

692
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:46,739
The next morning, John took Ginger and me
to Earlshall Park where Lord Gray lived.

693
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:52,489
There was a very fine house and lots of stables.

694
01:08:52,489 --> 01:08:59,049
John asked for Mr York, who was going to be
our new driver.

695
01:08:59,049 --> 01:09:08,900
Mr York was a good-looking man of about forty,
with a voice that expected to be obeyed.

696
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:17,029
He called a groom to take us to our boxes,
then invited John to have a drink with him.

697
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:24,690
We were taken to a pleasant stable and put
in boxes next to one another, then we were

698
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:26,779
groomed and fed.

699
01:09:26,779 --> 01:09:36,670
Half an hour later, John and Mr York came
to see us.

700
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:39,880
Mr York looked at us carefully.

701
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:48,080
'Is there anything you want to mention about
them, Mr Manly?' he said.

702
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:54,489
'I don't believe there's a better pair of
horses in the country,' said John, 'but they're

703
01:09:54,489 --> 01:09:56,710
not alike.

704
01:09:56,710 --> 01:10:02,640
The black one has the most perfect temper
I've ever known.

705
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:09,100
The other was badly treated before she came
to us, but has grown better- tempered in the

706
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,570
last three years.

707
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:15,530
We've never used a bearing rein with either
of them.'

708
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:19,500
'They'll wear one here,' said York.

709
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:26,310
'Lady Gray follows the fashion, and if her
horses are not reined up tight, she doesn't

710
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:28,050
like it.'

711
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:33,590
'I'm sorry to hear that,' said John.

712
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:38,390
He came to pat each of us for the last time.

713
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:44,960
I held my face close to him, which was all
I could do to say goodbye.

714
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:51,870
And then he was gone, and I have never seen
him since.

715
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:58,160
Lord Gray came to look at us the next day
and seemed pleased.

716
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:02,550
He heard what John had said about us.

717
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:07,340
'Keep an eye on the mare,' he said to York.

718
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:15,260
'Don't make the bearing rein too tight at
first, and I'll mention it to my wife.'

719
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:21,780
In the afternoon, we were harnessed to the
carriage and Lady Gray came out and looked

720
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,840
at us.

721
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:31,260
She was a tall, proud-looking woman and did
not look pleased, but she said nothing and

722
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:35,020
got into the carriage.

723
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:40,830
The bearing rein annoyed me but did not pull
my head any higher than I was used to carrying

724
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,300
it.

725
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:48,210
I was worried about Ginger, but she seemed
quite happy.

726
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:56,120
But the next afternoon when Lady Gray came
down the steps, she said, 'York, you must

727
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:02,350
put those horses' heads higher; they don't
look nice.'

728
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:09,030
'I'm sorry, my Lady,' said York, 'but they
have not been reined up for three years.

729
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:14,350
But if it pleases you, I can take them up
a little more.'

730
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:19,170
'Do that,' she said.

731
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:24,820
That day we had to pull the carriage up a
steep hill.

732
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:33,030
I wanted to put my head forward to make the
work easier, but I couldn't.

733
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:37,910
'Now you can see what it's like,' said Ginger,
when we came back.

734
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:43,199
'If it doesn't get any worse, I shall say
nothing.

735
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:48,460
But I won't have the rein pulled up tight!'

736
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:56,800
Each day the bearing reins were shortened
a little more; then one day Lady Gray came

737
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:05,179
out later than usual and said, 'York, when
will you get those horses' heads up.

738
01:13:05,179 --> 01:13:11,480
Pull them up at once, and let's have no arguing.'

739
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:17,520
York came to me first and made the rein very
tight.

740
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,210
Then he went to Ginger.

741
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:27,990
But the moment he took off the rein in order
to shorten it, she stood up on her back legs.

742
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:31,620
York and the groom could not control her.

743
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:40,590
She kicked herself out of the carriage and
fell down, kicking me on the leg as she went.

744
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:48,340
York sat on her head to keep her still and
shouted, 'Let the black horse out!

745
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,480
Undo the carriage!

746
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,800
Cut the harness!'

747
01:13:53,800 --> 01:14:04,550
The groom cut me out of the harness and hurried
me back to my box, then ran back to York.

748
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:12,100
I was angry and my leg hurt, and I felt that
I wanted to kick the first person who came

749
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,400
near me.

750
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:20,900
Soon after, Ginger was led in by two grooms.

751
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:25,260
York was with her and came to look at me.

752
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:33,880
'I knew those bearing reins would cause trouble,'
he said to himself.

753
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:40,670
He saw where I had been kicked and washed
the place gently with hot water to help the

754
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:44,280
pain.

755
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:49,610
Lord Gray was angry when he heard what had
happened.

756
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:56,610
He blamed York for taking orders from the
mistress, and York said that he would take

757
01:14:56,610 --> 01:15:02,300
orders only from Lord Gray himself from now
on.

758
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:09,750
But things went on the same as before, except
that Ginger was never put into the carriage

759
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:12,240
again.

760
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:19,750
I pulled it with a horse called Max who was
used to the tight rein.

761
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:25,530
But those four months pulling Lady Gray's
carriage were terrible.

762
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:33,159
The sharp bit cut into my tongue and mouth,
the rein hurt my neck and made it difficult

763
01:15:33,159 --> 01:15:41,560
to breathe, and I felt tired and very miserable.

764
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:51,630
In the spring, Lord Gray and some of his family
went up to London and took York with them.

765
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:55,969
Two daughters remained at the Hall.

766
01:15:55,969 --> 01:16:03,460
Lady Harriet never went out in the carriage,
and Lady Anne preferred riding on horseback

767
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:07,300
with her brother or cousins.

768
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:15,910
She chose me for her horse and I enjoyed these
rides, sometimes with Ginger, sometimes with

769
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:21,929
Lizzie, a horse liked by the young gentlemen.

770
01:16:21,929 --> 01:16:29,010
There was a gentleman called Blantyre staying
at the Hall, who always rode Lizzie and was

771
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:33,670
so pleased with her that Lady Anne wanted
to try her.

772
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:38,820
'I don't advise it,' said Blantyre.

773
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:42,570
'She's too easily frightened for a lady to
ride.'

774
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:51,719
'My dear cousin,' said Lady Anne, laughing,
'I've been riding horses since I was a baby

775
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:54,390
and have followed the hounds many times.

776
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:57,850
Now, help me up.'

777
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:05,400
So Blantyre helped her into the saddle, then
climbed on me.

778
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:11,500
Just as we were moving off, Lady Harriet asked
for a message to be taken to Dr Ashley in

779
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,340
the village.

780
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:21,469
The village was about two kilometres away,
and the doctor's house was the last one in

781
01:17:21,469 --> 01:17:22,690
it.

782
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:32,330
Blantyre got off to open the gate for Lady
Anne but she said, 'I'll wait here for you.'

783
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:37,199
He went off and we waited.

784
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:44,880
There was a field with an open gate on the
opposite side of the road, and at that moment,

785
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,550
some young horses came trotting out.

786
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:56,680
They were wild and excited, and there was
a boy behind them, waving a large whip.

787
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:06,010
Suddenly, one of the young horses ran across
the road, and banged into Lizzie's back legs.

788
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:13,210
She gave a violent kick, nearly unseating
Lady Anne, and immediately galloped away at

789
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:16,510
full speed.

790
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:24,420
I gave a loud neigh for help and made a noise
with my feet until Mr Blantyre came running

791
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:28,040
out of the doctor's house.

792
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:35,670
He saw Lizzie and Lady Anne, now far away
down the road, and quickly jumped into the

793
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:40,960
saddle, and we raced after them.

794
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:48,699
For about two kilometres, the road was straight,
then it turned to the right before becoming

795
01:18:48,699 --> 01:18:50,840
two roads.

796
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:57,480
Long before we came to the bend, Lady Anne
was out of sight.

797
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,590
Which way had she gone?

798
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:04,830
A woman was in her garden, looking up the
road.

799
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:07,420
'Which way?'

800
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:08,760
shouted Blantyre.

801
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,230
'To the right!'

802
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:14,550
cried the woman.

803
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:19,409
Away we went, up the right-hand road.

804
01:19:19,409 --> 01:19:26,780
We saw her for a moment, then she was gone
again round another bend.

805
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:31,890
Several times, we saw her, but lost her again.

806
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:39,179
Then we came to some rough land, very uneven
and full of holes in the ground - the worst

807
01:19:39,179 --> 01:19:43,000
possible place for galloping.

808
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:51,260
On this open ground, we could now see Lady
Anne clearly, her long hair flying out behind

809
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:57,630
her in the wind, and slowly we began to catch
up.

810
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:06,070
There was a wide ditch ahead and I was sure
it would stop them, but without a pause, Lizzie

811
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:09,690
jumped it - and fell.

812
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:16,510
I cleared the ditch and landed safely.

813
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:23,400
Lady Anne was lying on the ground, not moving.

814
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:32,340
Blantyre jumped down beside her and called
her name, but there was no reply.

815
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:36,350
Her face was white and her eyes were closed.

816
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:42,590
'Annie, dear Annie, do speak!' he cried.

817
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:50,940
There were two men cutting grass close by
and they saw Lizzie galloping away without

818
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:56,090
a rider and came across.

819
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:58,030
'Can you ride?'

820
01:20:58,030 --> 01:21:00,310
Blantyre asked one of them.

821
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:04,550
'I'm not a good horseman, sir,' he said.

822
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:08,770
'But I'll do my best.'

823
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:17,170
'Ride this horse to the doctor's and ask him
to come immediately, then go on to the Hall,'

824
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:18,440
said Blantyre.

825
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:25,340
'Tell them all you know and ask them to send
a carriage.'

826
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:31,120
The man climbed into my saddle and we galloped
off.

827
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:40,420
I tried not to shake him about too much, and
he soon discovered that he needed no whip.

828
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:45,650
There was a lot of excitement at the Hall
when they heard what happened.

829
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:52,800
I was put into my box, the saddle and bridle
were taken off and a cloth was thrown over

830
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,690
me.

831
01:21:55,690 --> 01:22:00,469
Two days later, Blantyre came and patted me.

832
01:22:00,469 --> 01:22:03,780
'You did well,' he said.

833
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:09,320
'I'm sure you knew Annie was in danger.

834
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:14,670
She must ride only you from now on.'

835
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:21,860
From this, I knew that my young mistress was
out of danger and would soon be able to ride

836
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:35,920
again.

837
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:44,620
CHAPTER NINE
The accident and new masters

838
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:52,200
A man called Reuben Smith looked after us
while York was in London.

839
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:58,130
He was gentle and clever with horses, and
an excellent driver.

840
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:04,860
But he had one fault - he sometimes drank
too much.

841
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:12,760
For weeks or months, he was all right, but
then without warning he would begin to drink

842
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:16,909
heavily and behave badly.

843
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:23,969
But he was a useful man so York had kept quiet
about Smith's drinking, saying nothing to

844
01:23:23,969 --> 01:23:27,240
Lord Gray.

845
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:35,510
Then one night Smith drove some ladies and
gentlemen home from a party and was so drunk

846
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,840
that he could not hold the reins.

847
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:44,969
York could not hide this and Lord Gray told
Smith to leave.

848
01:23:44,969 --> 01:23:55,300
However, sometime later, York spoke again
to Lord Gray, who was very kind-hearted, and

849
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:59,130
he took Reuben Smith back.

850
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:06,840
Smith promised never to get drunk again and
kept his promise, and because of this, he

851
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:13,190
was told to look after the stables while York
was away.

852
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:21,090
One day the carriage needed some repairs so
it was arranged that Smith would take it to

853
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:28,500
town, leave it at the carriage-maker's, and
then ride me back again.

854
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:36,190
Mr Blantyre wanted to go to the station, so
he went with us.

855
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:46,690
At the station, Mr Blantyre gave Smith some
money and said, 'Take care of Lady Anne, Reuben,

856
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:53,750
and don't let anyone else except her ride
Black Beauty.'

857
01:24:53,750 --> 01:25:01,520
We left the carriage at the maker's, and Smith
rode me to the White Lion hotel.

858
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:08,920
He told the stableman to give me some food
and have me ready for four o'clock.

859
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:18,010
One of my front shoes was loose but the stableman
did not see it until four o'clock.

860
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:25,360
Smith came back at five and said he would
now leave at six because he'd met some old

861
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,280
friends.

862
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,170
The stableman told him about the loose shoe.

863
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:40,670
'It'll be all right until we get home,' said
Smith.

864
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:49,420
He finally came back at nine o'clock, shouting
loudly and in a very bad temper.

865
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:57,780
We left and almost immediately, he began to
gallop, often giving me sharp cuts with the

866
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:03,690
whip, although I was going at full speed.

867
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:13,260
Before we were out of the town my shoe came
off, but Smith was too drunk to notice.

868
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:21,670
It was very dark, and on the rough road at
that speed, my foot was soon cut and bleeding

869
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:24,489
from the sharp stones.

870
01:26:24,489 --> 01:26:34,670
I could not go on; the pain was too great,
and I fell violently on both my knees.

871
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:37,670
Smith was thrown off.

872
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:45,150
He tried to get up but couldn't, then he lay
still.

873
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:50,199
I could do nothing but wait.

874
01:26:50,199 --> 01:26:56,900
It was nearly midnight when I heard a horse's
feet and the wheels of a carriage.

875
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:04,690
I neighed loudly, and was very happy to hear
an answering neigh from Ginger, and men's

876
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:07,660
voices.

877
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:12,920
Then the carriage came out of the darkness
and stopped.

878
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:16,969
Two men jumped down beside Smith.

879
01:27:16,969 --> 01:27:24,590
'It's Reuben,' said one, 'and he's not moving,
Robert.'

880
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:29,750
'He's dead,' said Robert, touching Smith.

881
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:38,090
'His hands are cold and his head is covered
with blood.'

882
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:42,420
They looked at me and saw my cut knees.

883
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:50,680
'The horse has been down and thrown him!'
said Robert.

884
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:56,420
He tried to lead me forward but I almost fell
again.

885
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:59,910
'He's bad in the foot, too.

886
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:07,300
No wonder he went down, riding over these
stones without a shoe!

887
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:09,910
Reuben was drunk, Ned.

888
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:15,410
He would never ride a horse without a shoe
unless he was drunk.'

889
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:21,500
Ned took Smith's body back in the carriage,
and Robert tied his handkerchief round my

890
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:26,590
foot and led me slowly home.

891
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:30,020
No one blamed me for the accident.

892
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:37,370
The owner of the White Lion hotel said that
Reuben Smith was drunk when he left.

893
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:44,030
But I had to leave Earlshall, and so did Ginger.

894
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:52,250
For a month or two, I was allowed to live
out in a field, and one day Ginger was brought

895
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:55,560
in to join me.

896
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:01,810
She had been ruined by the hard riding of
Lord Gray's son, and after twelve months'

897
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:05,890
rest she was going to be sold.

898
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:13,480
And although my knees got better, they looked
very ugly and so I was no longer suitable

899
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:17,140
for a fashionable family.

900
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:24,139
It was very pleasant being in the field with
Ginger, but one day Robert came in and took

901
01:29:24,139 --> 01:29:26,679
me away.

902
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:34,030
We were both very sad to say goodbye to each
other, Ginger and I.

903
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:41,200
I was sold to a man in Bath who kept many
horses and different kinds of carriages for

904
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,960
hire.

905
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:49,650
I was a 'job horse' and all kinds of people
hired me.

906
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:55,320
Some were good drivers, others were very bad.

907
01:29:55,320 --> 01:30:02,510
Then one man persuaded my master to sell me
to a friend of his who wanted a safe, pleasant

908
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:05,860
horse for riding.

909
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:12,670
And so that summer I was sold to Mr Barry.

910
01:30:12,670 --> 01:30:20,640
Mr Barry knew very little about horses but
he hired a comfortable stable for me, and

911
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:25,270
a man called Filcher to look after me.

912
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:32,790
He ordered the best oats, and plenty of other
good food for me to eat, too.

913
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:40,370
For a while, all went well, but then there
seemed to be fewer oats and more grass in

914
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:42,930
my meals.

915
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:50,030
The grass food, though very good, was not
enough to keep me strong and healthy.

916
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:58,219
However, I could not say anything and it went
on for about two months.

917
01:30:58,219 --> 01:31:05,880
Then one afternoon my master rode into the
country to see a friend - a gentleman farmer

918
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:10,860
who knew about horses, and who looked very
closely at me.

919
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:18,130
'Your horse doesn't look as well as he did
when you first had him, Barry,' he said, feeling

920
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:20,150
my neck and shoulders.

921
01:31:20,150 --> 01:31:27,409
'See how wet and warm he is - after just a
gentle ride!'

922
01:31:27,409 --> 01:31:35,780
'My groom says that horses are never in good
condition in the autumn,' said my master.

923
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:39,260
'But this is only August!' said the farmer.

924
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:46,340
'With your light work and the good food, he
shouldn't be like this.

925
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:53,440
I don't know who eats your oats, my friend,'
he went on, 'but I doubt that your horse gets

926
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,000
any of them.

927
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:00,400
I advise you to watch your groom more closely.'

928
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:04,139
Oh, how I wanted to speak!

929
01:32:04,139 --> 01:32:09,659
I wanted to tell my master where his oats
went to.

930
01:32:09,659 --> 01:32:17,180
My groom came every morning at six o'clock,
bringing his little boy with him.

931
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:23,700
The boy carried a basket and went into the
room where the oats were kept.

932
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:32,610
I would see them filling a bag with oats and
putting the bag into the basket.

933
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:39,660
Five or six mornings after the visit to the
farmer, the boy left the stable with his basket

934
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:46,770
of oats, but came back soon after, looking
frightened, with two policemen holding his

935
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:48,200
arms.

936
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:55,679
'Show me where your father keeps the food
for his chickens,' one policeman said to the

937
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:57,330
boy.

938
01:32:57,330 --> 01:33:03,560
The boy began to cry but there was no escape.

939
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:11,770
Moments later, the policemen found another
empty bag like the one in the boy's basket,

940
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:15,800
and they took Filcher away with them.

941
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:20,970
That was the last I ever saw of him.

942
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:28,230
Another groom was employed, but he was very
lazy about cleaning and I became thin and

943
01:33:28,230 --> 01:33:32,650
unhealthy from standing in a wet, dirty stable.

944
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:42,010
After all this trouble with grooms, Mr Barry
decided to stop keeping a horse and I was

945
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:50,980
sent to a horse fair - a place where hundreds
of horses were bought and sold, and more lies

946
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:57,650
were told, I think, than in any other place
in the country.

947
01:33:57,650 --> 01:34:00,650
That day I was lucky.

948
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:08,350
I was bought for twenty-five pounds by a man
called Jeremiah Barker, but everyone called

949
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:24,120
him Jerry and I shall do the same.

01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:31,150
CHAPTER TEN
A London cab horse

951
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:40,679
Jerry Barker was a small man, but well-made
and quick in all his movements.

952
01:34:40,679 --> 01:34:45,290
He lived in London and was a cab driver.

953
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:53,750
Jerry's wife, Polly, was a little woman with
smooth dark hair and dark eyes.

954
01:34:53,750 --> 01:35:02,389
His son, Harry, was nearly twelve years old,
and was a tall, good-tempered boy.

955
01:35:02,389 --> 01:35:10,570
His daughter, Dolly, was eight, and she looked
just like her mother.

956
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:19,240
Jerry had his own cab and two horses, which
he drove and groomed himself.

957
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:26,650
His other horse was a tall, white animal called
Captain.

958
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:33,030
The next morning, Polly and Dolly came to
see me.

959
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:39,730
Harry had helped his father since early that
morning and had already decided that I would

960
01:35:39,730 --> 01:35:42,970
be a good horse.

961
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:48,610
Polly brought me a piece of apple and Dolly
brought me some bread.

962
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:56,080
'We'll call him Jack, after the old one,'
said Jerry.

963
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:59,119
'Shall we, Polly?'

964
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:00,910
'Yes,' she said.

965
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:06,330
'I like to keep a good name going.'

966
01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:14,010
Captain went out in the cab all morning and
I went out in the afternoon.

967
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:19,670
Jerry took a lot of care to make sure that
my collar and bridle were comfortable - and

968
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:23,090
there was no bearing rein!

969
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:29,650
We went to the cabstand where the other cabs
were waiting for passengers, and took our

970
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:34,820
place at the back of the last cab.

971
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:38,310
Several of the other drivers came to look
at me.

972
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:41,580
'Too handsome,' said one.

973
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:45,600
'You'll find something wrong with him one
morning.'

974
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:52,210
Then a man in a grey coat and grey hat came
up.

975
01:36:52,210 --> 01:36:58,780
His name was Grant, and he looked a happy,
sensible kind of man.

976
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:05,230
He had been longer on the cabstand than any
of the other men, so they let him through

977
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:10,760
to have a look at me, and waited for his opinion.

978
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:16,369
He looked me all over very carefully, then
said:

979
01:37:16,369 --> 01:37:19,940
'He's the right kind for you, Jerry.

980
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:27,190
I don't care what you paid for him, he'll
be worth it.'

981
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:32,429
My first week as a cab horse was very hard.

982
01:37:32,429 --> 01:37:43,150
I was not used to London - the noise, the
hurry, the crowds of horses, carts and carriages.

983
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:52,760
But Jerry was a good driver and soon discovered
that I was willing to work and do my best.

984
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:59,790
He never used the whip on me, and we soon
understood each other as well as a horse and

985
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:03,220
man can do.

986
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:11,469
Jerry kept his horses clean and gave us plenty
of food and fresh water, and on Sundays, we

987
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,889
rested.

988
01:38:13,889 --> 01:38:19,130
I never knew a better man than my new master.

989
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:25,840
He was kind and good-tempered, like John Manly.

990
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:33,450
Harry was clever at stable work and always
wanted to do what he could.

991
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:40,969
Polly and Dolly came in the morning to brush
out the cab, and to wash the glass, while

992
01:38:40,969 --> 01:38:46,130
Jerry gave Captain and me a grooming.

993
01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:51,970
There was a lot of laughing and fun between
them, which all helped to keep Captain and

994
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:55,620
me happy.

995
01:38:55,620 --> 01:39:02,780
The family came early in the morning because
Jerry did not like lateness.

996
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:10,550
It always made him angry when people wanted
him to drive hard because of their own lateness.

997
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:16,040
One day, two wild-looking young men called
to him.

998
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,970
'Cabby!

999
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:23,480
Hurry up, we're late for our train at Victoria.

1000
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:29,380
Get us there in time for the one o'clock train
and we'll pay you double!'

1001
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:35,949
'I will take you at the usual speed, gentlemen,'
said Jerry.

1002
01:39:35,949 --> 01:39:40,110
'Extra money doesn't pay for extra speed.'

1003
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:44,150
Larry's cab was standing next to ours.

1004
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:49,900
He opened the door and said, 'I'm your man,
gentlemen!

1005
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:53,650
My horse will get you there all right.'

1006
01:39:53,650 --> 01:40:02,780
And as he shut them in, with a smile at Jerry,
he said, 'He always refuses to go faster than

1007
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:04,409
a trot!'

1008
01:40:04,409 --> 01:40:12,440
Then, whipping his horse hard, he went off
as fast as he could.

1009
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:16,869
Jerry patted me on the neck.

1010
01:40:16,869 --> 01:40:24,119
'Extra money won't pay for that kind of thing,
will it, Jack?' he said.

1011
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:30,889
Although he was against hard driving to please
careless people, he always went at a fair

1012
01:40:30,889 --> 01:40:38,980
speed and was not against going faster if
there was a good reason.

1013
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:47,760
I remember one morning we were on the stand
waiting for a passenger when a young man carrying

1014
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,600
a large suitcase went by.

1015
01:40:51,600 --> 01:41:00,320
He stepped on a piece of apple, which lay
in the road, and fell down heavily.

1016
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:11,080
Jerry ran across the road and helped him up,
then took him into a shop to sit him down.

1017
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:20,659
Sometime later, the young man, looking white
and ill, came out again and called Jerry,

1018
01:41:20,659 --> 01:41:24,489
so we went across the road.

1019
01:41:24,489 --> 01:41:28,300
'Can you take me to the South-Eastern Railway?'

1020
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,300
he said.

1021
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:38,440
'My fall has made me late, and it's very important
that I don't miss the twelve o'clock train.

1022
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:43,130
I'll pay you extra if you can get me there
in time.'

1023
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:53,380
'We'll do our best, sir,' said Jerry, and
helped him into the cab.

1024
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:59,380
It was always difficult to drive fast in the
city in the middle of the day, when the streets

1025
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:06,950
were full of traffic, but Jerry and I were
used to it, and no one was faster at getting

1026
01:42:06,950 --> 01:42:14,659
through the carriages and carts, all moving
at different speeds, going this way and that

1027
01:42:14,659 --> 01:42:15,719
way.

1028
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:23,429
In and out, in and out we went, as fast as
a horse can do it.

1029
01:42:23,429 --> 01:42:30,340
And we got to the station just as the big
clock showed eight minutes to twelve.

1030
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:35,969
'We're in time!' said the young man, happily.

1031
01:42:35,969 --> 01:42:42,449
'Thank you, my friend, and your good horse,
too.

1032
01:42:42,449 --> 01:42:43,449
Take this extra money -'

1033
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:47,810
'No, sir,' said Jerry.

1034
01:42:47,810 --> 01:42:51,130
'Thank you, but it isn't necessary.

1035
01:42:51,130 --> 01:43:00,429
I'm glad we were in time - now hurry and catch
your train.'

1036
01:43:00,429 --> 01:43:07,239
When we got back to the cabstand, the other
men were laughing because Jerry had driven

1037
01:43:07,239 --> 01:43:09,869
hard to the train.

1038
01:43:09,869 --> 01:43:16,890
'How much extra did he pay you, Jerry?' said
one driver.

1039
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:19,580
'Nothing,' said Jerry.

1040
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:24,820
'He offered me extra but I didn't take it.

1041
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:35,369
If Jack and I choose to have a quick run now
and then, that's our business and not yours.'

1042
01:43:35,369 --> 01:43:39,460
'You'll never be a rich man then,' said Larry.

1043
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:46,909
'Perhaps not,' said Jerry, 'but I'll be a
happy one!'

1044
01:43:46,909 --> 01:43:55,790
'And you, Larry,' added Mr Grant, 'will die
poor, because you spend too much money on

1045
01:43:55,790 --> 01:44:04,120
new whips, beating your poor horse until it's
exhausted - and then you have to buy another

1046
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:05,120
one.'

1047
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:11,270
'Well, I've never had good luck with my horses,'
said Larry.

1048
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:15,860
'And you never will,' said Mr Grant.

1049
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:23,739
'Good Luck is very careful who she travels
with, and mostly chooses those who are kind

1050
01:44:23,739 --> 01:44:26,460
and sensible.

1051
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:29,970
That's my experience, anyway.'

1052
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:38,660
He turned round again to his newspaper, and
the other men went back to their cabs.

1053
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:48,730
Winter came early, with snow, rain or strong
winds almost every day for weeks.

1054
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:55,770
Jerry sometimes went to a coffee shop near
the cabstand, and sometimes Dolly came with

1055
01:44:55,770 --> 01:45:01,320
some hot soup that Polly had made for him.

1056
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:09,179
One cold windy day, Dolly was waiting for
Jerry to finish his soup when a gentleman

1057
01:45:09,179 --> 01:45:12,630
came towards us.

1058
01:45:12,630 --> 01:45:19,260
Jerry started to give the soup bowl back to
Dolly and was just going to take off my warm

1059
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:26,610
cloth when the man said, 'No, no, finish your
soup, my friend.

1060
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:31,080
I can wait in the cab until you've finished.'

1061
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:34,630
Jerry thanked him, then came back to Dolly.

1062
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:39,949
'That's a real gentleman, Dolly,' he said.

1063
01:45:39,949 --> 01:45:47,260
'He has time and thought for the comfort of
a poor cab driver.'

1064
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:53,690
Jerry finished his soup, then we took the
man to Clapham.

1065
01:45:53,690 --> 01:46:00,930
After that, he took our cab several times,
and often came to pat me.

1066
01:46:00,930 --> 01:46:09,370
It was very unusual for anyone to notice a
cab horse, and I was grateful.

1067
01:46:09,370 --> 01:46:16,180
Another day, the gentleman saw a cart with
two horses standing in the street.

1068
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:23,260
The driver was not with them and I don't know
how long they had been standing there.

1069
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:28,440
However, they decided to move on a few steps.

1070
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:34,400
Suddenly, the cart driver ran out of a building
and caught them.

1071
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:42,159
He seemed very angry and began to whip the
horses hard, even beating them around the

1072
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:43,429
head.

1073
01:46:43,429 --> 01:46:49,000
Our gentleman saw him and walked quickly across.

1074
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:54,719
'Stop that at once or I'll call the police!'
he said.

1075
01:46:54,719 --> 01:47:02,130
The driver was drunk and he began to shout,
but he stopped whipping the horses.

1076
01:47:02,130 --> 01:47:10,120
Meanwhile, our gentleman wrote down the name
and address that was on the side of the cart.

1077
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:13,330
'Why do you want that?'

1078
01:47:13,330 --> 01:47:17,290
shouted the driver.

1079
01:47:17,290 --> 01:47:20,390
Our gentleman didn't answer.

1080
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:23,760
He came back to the cab.

1081
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:31,310
'Many people have thanked me for telling them
how their horses have been used,' he told

1082
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:32,700
Jerry.

1083
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:40,270
'I wish there were more gentlemen like you,
sir,' said Jerry.

1084
01:47:40,270 --> 01:47:53,000
'They're needed in this city.'

1085
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:01,440
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Goodbye to old friends

1086
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:09,960
One day we were waiting outside one of the
London parks when a dirty old cab drove up

1087
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:12,739
beside ours.

1088
01:48:12,739 --> 01:48:19,360
The horse was brown, with bones that showed
through her coat.

1089
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:26,219
I was eating some hay and the wind took a
little of it her way.

1090
01:48:26,219 --> 01:48:34,639
The poor animal put out her long thin neck
and picked it up, then turned and looked for

1091
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:35,920
more.

1092
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:44,930
There was a hopeless look in her dull eye
and I wondered where I'd seen her before.

1093
01:48:44,930 --> 01:48:47,540
Then she looked straight at me.

1094
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:53,960
'Black Beauty, is that you?'

1095
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:56,870
she said.

1096
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:59,969
It was Ginger!

1097
01:48:59,969 --> 01:49:03,730
But how different she looked!

1098
01:49:03,730 --> 01:49:13,971
Her face, which was once so full of life,
was now miserable and full of pain, and her

1099
01:49:13,971 --> 01:49:16,710
breathing was very bad.

1100
01:49:16,710 --> 01:49:25,250
I moved closer to her so that we could have
a quiet talk, and it was a sad story that

1101
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:28,710
she told me.

1102
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:35,929
After twelve months' rest at Earlshall, she
was considered to be ready to work again,

1103
01:49:35,929 --> 01:49:38,580
and was sold to a gentleman.

1104
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:48,760
She got on well for a little while, but after
a long gallop one day, she became ill again.

1105
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:55,510
She was rested, was seen by a horse-doctor,
then sold.

1106
01:49:55,510 --> 01:50:04,719
In this way, she went from owner to owner
several times, each one poorer than the one

1107
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:06,159
before.

1108
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:15,970
'So at last I was bought by a man who keeps
a number of cabs and horses, and hires them

1109
01:50:15,970 --> 01:50:19,760
out,' said Ginger.

1110
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:28,619
'You look happy and comfortable with life
as a cab horse, and I'm glad, but it's different

1111
01:50:28,619 --> 01:50:30,050
for me.

1112
01:50:30,050 --> 01:50:37,160
They whip me and work me seven days a week.

1113
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:46,099
They say that they paid more for me than I
was worth, and now they're trying to get their

1114
01:50:46,099 --> 01:50:52,320
money back by working me until I drop.'

1115
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:58,990
'You used to stand up and fight when people
were cruel to you,' I said.

1116
01:50:58,990 --> 01:51:03,920
'Yes, I did once,' said Ginger.

1117
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:13,650
'But men are stronger than we are, and if
they're cruel and have no feelings, then there's

1118
01:51:13,650 --> 01:51:17,340
nothing we can do about it.

1119
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:22,550
Oh, I wish the end would come.

1120
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:26,510
I wish I was dead.'

1121
01:51:26,510 --> 01:51:29,560
I was very sad.

1122
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:37,450
I put my nose against hers but could find
nothing to say that would cheer her up.

1123
01:51:37,450 --> 01:51:49,410
I think she was pleased to see me, because
she said, 'You're the only friend I ever had.'

1124
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:58,389
A few weeks after this, a cart with a dead
horse in it passed by our cabstand.

1125
01:51:58,389 --> 01:52:06,530
It was a brown horse with a long thin neck,
and I believe it was Ginger.

1126
01:52:06,530 --> 01:52:15,440
I hoped it was, because then her troubles
would be over.

1127
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:19,570
There was one day when we were very busy.

1128
01:52:19,570 --> 01:52:29,840
First, a fat gentleman with a large bag wanted
to go to Bishopsgate Station; then we were

1129
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:37,790
called by a lady who wanted to be taken to
Regent's Park; then a man jumped into the

1130
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:44,489
cab and called out, 'Bow Street Police Station,
quick!'

1131
01:52:44,489 --> 01:52:51,889
After another journey or two, we came back
to the cabstand and Jerry gave me some food,

1132
01:52:51,889 --> 01:52:57,420
saying, 'We must eat when we can on days like
this, Jack.'

1133
01:52:57,420 --> 01:53:02,640
And he took out the meat and bread Polly had
given him.

1134
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:10,449
But neither of us had eaten many mouthfuls
before a poor young woman came along the street.

1135
01:53:10,449 --> 01:53:15,679
She was carrying a child and she looked lost
and worried.

1136
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:20,909
'Can you tell me the way to St Thomas's Hospital,
please?'

1137
01:53:20,909 --> 01:53:22,030
she asked.

1138
01:53:22,030 --> 01:53:28,929
'I have to take my little boy there, and I'm
a stranger in London.'

1139
01:53:28,929 --> 01:53:32,580
The little boy was crying as she spoke.

1140
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:40,869
'He's in great pain and can't walk, but the
doctor says that if I can get him to the hospital,

1141
01:53:40,869 --> 01:53:43,490
then perhaps he'll get well again.'

1142
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:48,560
'You can't carry him through the crowds,'
said Jerry.

1143
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:52,560
'It's five kilometres, and that child is heavy.'

1144
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,670
'I'm strong,' said the woman.

1145
01:53:56,670 --> 01:54:01,580
'I think I can manage, if I know the way.'

1146
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:05,510
'You can't do it.

1147
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:11,550
Just get into this cab and I'll drive you
there.

1148
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:15,300
Don't you see that it's beginning to rain?'

1149
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:22,199
'No, sir, I can't do that,' she said.

1150
01:54:22,199 --> 01:54:27,400
'I've only just enough money to get me home
again.'

1151
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:30,239
'Listen,' said Jerry.

1152
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:40,070
'I've got a wife and children at home, and
I'd be ashamed of myself if I let a woman

1153
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:45,790
and a sick child put themselves in danger.

1154
01:54:45,790 --> 01:54:49,290
Get in the cab and I'll take you for nothing.'

1155
01:54:49,290 --> 01:55:00,990
'Oh, how kind you are!' said the woman, and
began to cry.

1156
01:55:00,990 --> 01:55:08,340
Jerry opened the door but two men ran up,
calling out, 'Cab!'

1157
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:18,000
'It's taken,' said Jerry, but one man pushed
past the woman and jumped in, followed by

1158
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,860
the other.

1159
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:28,860
'This cab is already taken, gentlemen,' Jerry
said again, 'by this lady.'

1160
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:35,619
'Lady!' said one of the men unpleasantly,
looking at the woman's poor clothes.

1161
01:55:35,619 --> 01:55:38,340
'She can wait.

1162
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:46,780
Our business is very important, and anyway,
we were in first, and we'll stay in.'

1163
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:54,159
A smile came over Jerry's face as he shut
the cab door.

1164
01:55:54,159 --> 01:55:57,800
'Stay in as long as you like, gentlemen.

1165
01:55:57,800 --> 01:56:02,110
I can wait while you rest yourselves.'

1166
01:56:02,110 --> 01:56:06,790
He walked over to the young woman who was
standing nearby.

1167
01:56:06,790 --> 01:56:14,159
'They'll soon be gone, don't worry,' he said,
laughing.

1168
01:56:14,159 --> 01:56:16,960
And he was right.

1169
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:24,080
When the two men realized that they were going
to have a very long wait, they got out, calling

1170
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:28,710
Jerry all kinds of bad names.

1171
01:56:28,710 --> 01:56:33,270
After this, we were soon on our way to the
hospital.

1172
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:42,540
'Thank you a thousand times,' said the young
woman, as Jerry helped her out of the cab.

1173
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:48,900
'I hope your child will soon be better,' said
Jerry.

1174
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:54,090
He watched her go in, then patted my neck.

1175
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:59,700
It was something he always did when he was
pleased.

1176
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:07,389
The rain was now coming down fast and, just
as we were leaving the hospital, a lady came

1177
01:57:07,389 --> 01:57:12,020
down the steps calling, 'Cab!'

1178
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:14,700
Jerry seemed to know her at once.

1179
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:22,290
'Jerry Barker, is it you?' said the woman.

1180
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:25,150
'I'm very glad to find you here.

1181
01:57:25,150 --> 01:57:28,869
It's difficult to get a cab in this part of
London today.'

1182
01:57:28,869 --> 01:57:33,710
'I'll be proud to take you,' said Jerry.

1183
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:37,260
'Where do you want to go?'

1184
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:42,599
'Paddington Station,' said the woman.

1185
01:57:42,599 --> 01:57:48,050
We got to the station and went in under cover.

1186
01:57:48,050 --> 01:57:56,810
The lady stood beside the cab talking to Jerry
for some time, and I discovered that she was

1187
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:59,730
once Polly's mistress.

1188
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:04,300
'How do you like cab work in the winter?'

1189
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:06,840
she asked Jerry.

1190
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:09,820
'Polly was worried about your cough last year.'

1191
01:58:09,820 --> 01:58:19,100
'She worries because I work all hours and
in all kinds of weather,' said Jerry.

1192
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:27,820
'But I get on all right, and I would be lost
without horses to look after.'

1193
01:58:27,820 --> 01:58:34,159
'It would be wrong to harm your health in
this work when you have a wife and two children,'

1194
01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:35,660
said the lady.

1195
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:42,469
'There are many places where good drivers
or grooms are wanted.

1196
01:58:42,469 --> 01:58:48,750
If you ever decide to give up cab work, let
me know.'

1197
01:58:48,750 --> 01:58:51,239
She put something into his hand.

1198
01:58:51,239 --> 01:58:56,429
'There's some money for the children.'

1199
01:58:56,429 --> 01:59:04,790
Jerry thanked her and, after leaving the station,
we went home.

1200
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:12,570
Christmas and the New Year are no holidays
for cab drivers and their horses.

1201
01:59:12,570 --> 01:59:19,440
People go to parties and dances, and the work
is often late.

1202
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:28,060
Sometimes driver and horse have to wait for
hours, shaking with cold.

1203
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:36,670
We had a lot of late work during Christmas
week and Jerry's cough was bad.

1204
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:43,869
On New Year's Eve we took two gentlemen to
a house in the West End, and were told to

1205
01:59:43,869 --> 01:59:46,580
come for them at eleven o'clock.

1206
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:56,170
'You may have to wait a few minutes, but don't
be late,' one of them said.

1207
01:59:56,170 --> 02:00:01,719
Jerry arrived at the right time and we waited.

1208
02:00:01,719 --> 02:00:07,350
The wind was very cold and it was snowing.

1209
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:13,500
Jerry pulled one of my cloths higher over
my neck, then walked up and down, trying to

1210
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:15,110
keep warm.

1211
02:00:15,110 --> 02:00:23,739
At half-past twelve, Jerry rang the doorbell
and asked if the gentlemen still wanted the

1212
02:00:23,739 --> 02:00:25,800
cab.

1213
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:32,080
The man at the door said, 'Oh, yes, you'll
be wanted.'

1214
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:39,590
At one o'clock, the door opened and two men
came out.

1215
02:00:39,590 --> 02:00:45,599
They got in the cab without a word, and told
Jerry where to drive.

1216
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:53,860
It was three kilometres away, and when the
men got out they didn't say they were sorry

1217
02:00:53,860 --> 02:01:00,159
for the long wait, but they were angry when
Jerry made them pay for the extra waiting

1218
02:01:00,159 --> 02:01:01,989
time.

1219
02:01:01,989 --> 02:01:06,800
But it was money hard-earned.

1220
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:15,170
When we got home, Jerry could not speak, and
his cough was terrible, but he groomed me

1221
02:01:15,170 --> 02:01:20,869
and made sure that I was warm and comfortable.

1222
02:01:20,869 --> 02:01:28,420
It was late the next morning before anyone
came, and then it was only Harry.

1223
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:35,469
He cleaned us and gave us our food but was
very quiet.

1224
02:01:35,469 --> 02:01:42,020
Later that morning he came again, and this
time Dolly came with him.

1225
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:50,050
She was crying, and I discovered from their
conversation that Jerry was dangerously ill.

1226
02:01:50,050 --> 02:01:57,659
Two days passed, and only Harry and Dolly
came to the stable.

1227
02:01:57,659 --> 02:02:05,410
On the third day, Mr Grant from the cabstand
arrived when Harry was in the stable.

1228
02:02:05,410 --> 02:02:14,810
'I won't go to the house, boy, but how is
your father?' he said.

1229
02:02:14,810 --> 02:02:18,170
'He's very bad,' said Harry.

1230
02:02:18,170 --> 02:02:23,639
'I'm sorry to hear that,' said Mr Grant.

1231
02:02:23,639 --> 02:02:27,849
'He's the best man I know.'

1232
02:02:27,849 --> 02:02:37,360
But when he came the next day, Harry was able
to tell him, 'Father is better today.

1233
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:40,020
Mother hopes he will get over it soon.'

1234
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:46,449
'Thank God!' said Mr Grant.

1235
02:02:46,449 --> 02:02:53,670
He was a kind man, and did a lot to help the
family during this time, because while Jerry

1236
02:02:53,670 --> 02:03:02,050
was ill, he was earning no money, and we all
had to eat.

1237
02:03:02,050 --> 02:03:09,680
Jerry got slowly better, but the doctor said
he must never do cab work again.

1238
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:15,710
The children talked a lot about what their
mother and father would do, but a few days

1239
02:03:15,710 --> 02:03:21,040
later Dolly ran into the stable to find Harry.

1240
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:28,429
'There's a letter from Mrs Fowler, mother's
old mistress!' said Dolly.

1241
02:03:28,429 --> 02:03:36,090
'She wants father to be her carriage driver,
and we're going to live in a cottage in the

1242
02:03:36,090 --> 02:03:42,469
country - with chickens, and apple trees,
and everything!'

1243
02:03:42,469 --> 02:03:45,830
This was bad news for me.

1244
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:53,179
I was not young now, and could not hope for
a better master than Jerry, although Mr Grant

1245
02:03:53,179 --> 02:03:57,730
promised to find a comfortable place for me.

1246
02:03:57,730 --> 02:04:14,690
I never saw Jerry again and was very sorry
to leave.

1247
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:21,340
CHAPTER TWELVE
Hard times

1248
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:27,349
I was sold to a baker who Jerry knew, but
the baker's cart driver was a man called Jakes,

1249
02:04:27,349 --> 02:04:30,139
who drove with the bearing rein up.

1250
02:04:30,139 --> 02:04:38,020
This made it difficult for me to pull a heavy
cart, and I found the work very hard.

1251
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:49,179
One day, after three or four months of this,
I was pulling the cart, which was much heavier

1252
02:04:49,179 --> 02:04:52,190
than usual, up a steep hill.

1253
02:04:52,190 --> 02:05:00,300
I had to stop several times to rest, which
didn't please Jakes.

1254
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:13,880
'Move on, you lazy horse, or I'll make you!'
he shouted, and he hit me with his whip.

1255
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:19,119
After a few more metres, I had to stop again.

1256
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:26,910
The whip came down across my back once more
and the pain was sharp.

1257
02:05:26,910 --> 02:05:42,329
I was doing my best but the driver was still
punishing me cruelly, which seemed very unfair.

1258
02:05:42,329 --> 02:05:51,710
Jakes was whipping me a third time when a
woman hurried over and said, 'Oh, please don't

1259
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:54,290
whip your horse like that.

1260
02:05:54,290 --> 02:05:58,940
I think I can help, if you'll let me.'

1261
02:05:58,940 --> 02:05:59,969
Jakes laughed.

1262
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:00,969
'Oh?'

1263
02:06:00,969 --> 02:06:09,260
'He can't use all his strength when his head
is held back with that bearing rein,' the

1264
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:10,810
woman went on.

1265
02:06:10,810 --> 02:06:15,969
'If you take it off, I'm sure he'll do better.'

1266
02:06:15,969 --> 02:06:18,800
'Anything to please a lady,' said Jakes, smiling.

1267
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:28,470
The rein was taken off and I moved my head
up and down several times to help my aching

1268
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:29,470
neck.

1269
02:06:29,470 --> 02:06:37,350
'Poor boy is that what you wanted?' said the
woman, patting me.

1270
02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:40,489
She turned to Jakes.

1271
02:06:40,489 --> 02:06:49,620
'If you speak to him kindly and lead him on,
I believe he'll do better.'

1272
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:57,360
Jakes took the rein, and I put down my head
and moved on.

1273
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:05,150
I pulled the cart up the hill, then stopped
to take a breath.

1274
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:12,079
'Well, that helped,' said Jakes, 'but if I
went without a bearing rein all the time,

1275
02:07:12,079 --> 02:07:14,949
the other cart drivers would laugh at me.

1276
02:07:14,949 --> 02:07:16,389
It's fashionable, you see.'

1277
02:07:16,389 --> 02:07:21,949
'It's better to start a good fashion than
to follow a bad one,' said the woman.

1278
02:07:21,949 --> 02:07:24,179
'Many gentlemen don't use bearing reins now.'

1279
02:07:24,179 --> 02:07:27,060
She gave me another pat on the neck and walked
on.

1280
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:30,429
After that, Jakes always took off my bearing
rein when I was going up a hill, and that

1281
02:07:30,429 --> 02:07:31,429
made my life easier.

1282
02:07:31,429 --> 02:07:36,840
But pulling heavy carts day after day slowly
began to exhaust me and a younger horse was

1283
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:38,710
brought in to do my work.

1284
02:07:38,710 --> 02:07:41,030
I was sold to another cab owner whose name
was Nicholas Skinner.

1285
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:44,969
He was hard on his drivers, and they were
hard on the horses.

1286
02:07:44,969 --> 02:07:51,070
We worked long hours, had no Sunday rest,
and it was a hot summer.

1287
02:07:51,070 --> 02:07:58,620
My driver was just as hard as his master,
and he had a cruel whip with something sharp

1288
02:07:58,620 --> 02:08:03,099
at the end which often cut me and made me
bleed.

1289
02:08:03,099 --> 02:08:08,360
It was a terrible life, and sometimes, like
poor Ginger, I wished I was dead.

1290
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:10,599
One day I nearly got my wish.

1291
02:08:10,599 --> 02:08:18,060
We were at the railway station when a family
of four people hired us.

1292
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:23,590
There was a noisy man with a lady, a little
boy, a young girl, and a lot of heavy luggage.

1293
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:24,639
'Father,' said the young girl, 'this poor
horse can't take us and all our luggage.

1294
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:25,639
He's too tired.'

1295
02:08:25,639 --> 02:08:26,639
'Oh, he's all right, miss!' said my driver.

1296
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:27,639
He put a heavy box on the cab with the other
luggage.

1297
02:08:27,639 --> 02:08:28,639
'Father, please take a second cab,' said the
girl.

1298
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:29,639
'I'm sure this is very cruel.'

1299
02:08:29,639 --> 02:08:30,639
'Grace, get in at once, and don't be stupid,'
said her father.

1300
02:08:30,639 --> 02:08:31,639
'The driver knows his own business.'

1301
02:08:31,639 --> 02:08:33,389
My gentle friend had to obey, and box after
box was lifted up and put on the top of the

1302
02:08:33,389 --> 02:08:36,000
cab, or next to the driver.

1303
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:41,820
Then the driver hit me with his whip and we
moved out of the station.

1304
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:44,130
The cab was very heavy and I had not eaten
or rested since early that morning.

1305
02:08:44,130 --> 02:08:46,330
I did my best and got along quite well until
we came to Ludgate Hill.

1306
02:08:46,330 --> 02:08:48,500
By then I was exhausted, and the heavy cab
was too much for me.

1307
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:51,630
My feet went from under me and I fell heavily,
knocking all the breath out of me.

1308
02:08:51,630 --> 02:08:55,739
I lay quite still because I could not move.

1309
02:08:55,739 --> 02:08:57,450
Indeed, I expected to die.

1310
02:08:57,450 --> 02:09:01,920
There were angry voices above me and luggage
was taken off the cab, but it was all like

1311
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:02,920
a dream.

1312
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:05,520
I thought I heard the girl's voice saying,
'Oh, that poor horse!

1313
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,530
It's all our fault!'

1314
02:09:06,530 --> 02:09:10,380
Someone loosened my bridle and collar, and
another voice said, 'He's dead, he'll never

1315
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:11,380
get up again.'

1316
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:14,770
I heard a policeman giving orders but I did
not open my eyes.

1317
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:16,630
Cold water was thrown over my head, some medicine
was put into my mouth, and I was covered with

1318
02:09:16,630 --> 02:09:17,630
a cloth.

1319
02:09:17,630 --> 02:09:20,829
I don't know how long I was there, but a man
with a kind voice persuaded me to try to get

1320
02:09:20,829 --> 02:09:24,010
up - and I managed it.

1321
02:09:24,010 --> 02:09:30,370
Then I was gently led to some stables close
by.

1322
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:36,900
That evening, I was taken back to Skinner's
stables, and the next morning the horse-doctor

1323
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:38,520
came to see me.

1324
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:41,690
'He's been worked too hard,' said the doctor.

1325
02:09:41,690 --> 02:09:43,180
'There's no strength left in him.'

1326
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:44,310
'Then he must go for dog food,' said Skinner.

1327
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:47,030
'I have no fields for sick horses.

1328
02:09:47,030 --> 02:09:48,980
It doesn't suit my business.

1329
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:52,260
I work them for as long as they'll go, then
I sell them for what I can get.'

1330
02:09:52,260 --> 02:09:57,219
'There's a horse fair in ten days' time,'
said the doctor.

1331
02:09:57,219 --> 02:10:07,460
'If you rest him and give him food, he may
get better, and then you may get more than

1332
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:08,460
his skin's worth.'

1333
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:12,070
Luckily, for me, Skinner took the doctor's
advice and, after rest and food, I began to

1334
02:10:12,070 --> 02:10:13,070
feel better.

1335
02:10:13,070 --> 02:10:16,010
Ten days later, I was taken to the horse fair,
a few miles outside London.

1336
02:10:16,010 --> 02:10:17,170
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
My last home

1337
02:10:17,170 --> 02:10:21,160
I was sold to a farmer at the horse fair,
but it was his young grandson who persuaded

1338
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:22,160
him to buy me.

1339
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:23,160
The two of them walked past me and, seeing
kindness in the farmer's face, I lifted my

1340
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:24,160
head, put my ears forward and tried to look
my best.

1341
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:25,160
The farmer stopped and looked at me.

1342
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:26,160
'There's a horse, Willie, that has known better
days,' he said.

1343
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:27,160
'Poor thing!' said the boy.

1344
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:28,160
'Do you think he was ever a carriage horse,
grandfather?'

1345
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:29,160
'Oh, yes,' said the farmer.

1346
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:30,160
'Look at his fine head and the shape of his
neck and shoulder.'

1347
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,160
He reached out a hand and patted me on the
neck.

1348
02:10:31,160 --> 02:10:32,160
I put out my nose in answer to his kindness,
and the boy gently put his hand against my

1349
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:33,160
face.

1350
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:34,160
'Look how well he understands kindness,' said
the boy.

1351
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:35,160
'Won't you buy him, and make him young and
strong again?'

1352
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:36,160
The man who was selling me said, 'The boy
can recognize a good horse, sir.

1353
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:37,160
This one isn't old, just tired and thin from
too much work.

1354
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:38,160
In six months, he'll be fine.'

1355
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:39,160
Five pounds changed hands and, soon after,
I was taken to my new home.

1356
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:40,160
The farmer gave orders for me to have hay
and oats every night and morning, and I was

1357
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:41,160
let out into a large field in the daytime.

1358
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:42,160
Willie, the young boy, was responsible for
me, and he came to see me every day, bringing

1359
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:43,160
carrots or apples.

1360
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:44,160
During that winter, the rest, the good food,
the soft grass and gentle running and trotting

1361
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:45,160
all helped to make me feel quite young again.

1362
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:46,160
When the spring came, the farmer tried me
with a carriage, and I did the work quite

1363
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:47,160
easily.

1364
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:48,160
'He's growing young, Willie,' he said.

1365
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:49,160
'We'll give him some gentle work and look
for a good home for him.'

1366
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,160
One day during this summer, the groom cleaned
and dressed me with special care, and Willie

1367
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:51,160
seemed half-worried and half-excited as he
got into the carriage with his grandfather.

1368
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:52,160
'I hope the ladies like him,' said the farmer.

1369
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:53,160
A kilometer or two beyond the village, we
came to a pretty house, and Willie went to

1370
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:54,160
knock on the door.

1371
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:55,160
He asked if Miss Blomefield and Miss Ellen
were at home.

1372
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:56,160
They were, and Willie stayed with me while
the farmer went into the house.

1373
02:10:56,160 --> 02:10:57,160
He came back about ten minutes later with
three ladies.

1374
02:10:57,160 --> 02:10:58,160
They seemed to like me, but one of them, worried
by my knees, wondered if I was safe.

1375
02:10:58,160 --> 02:10:59,160
'It's true his knees were broken once,' said
the farmer, 'but we don't know why he fell.

1376
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:00,160
It was probably a careless driver and not
the horse's fault at all.

1377
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:01,160
He seems very safe to me.

1378
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:02,160
If you like him, you can try him for a few
weeks,' he went on.

1379
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:03,160
'Then your driver will see what he thinks
of him.'

1380
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:04,160
One of the three ladies - a tall, white-faced
lady, who held the arm of a younger woman

1381
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:05,160
- said, 'You have always given us good advice
about our horses, so we accept your offer

1382
02:11:05,160 --> 02:11:06,160
to try him.'

1383
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:07,160
The next morning, a young man came for me.

1384
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:08,160
He looked pleased until he saw my knees, then
he said, 'I'm surprised you suggested this

1385
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:09,160
horse to my ladies.'

1386
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:10,160
'You're only taking him to try him,' said
the farmer.

1387
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:11,160
'If he's not as safe as any horse you ever
drove, send him back, young man.'

1388
02:11:11,160 --> 02:11:12,160
I was taken to a comfortable stable, given
some food, then left to myself.

1389
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:13,160
The next day, the groom was cleaning my face
when he said, 'That's just like the star that

1390
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:14,160
Black Beauty had on his forehead.

1391
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:15,160
I wonder where he is now.'

1392
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:16,160
He looked more closely at me.

1393
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:17,160
'White star on the forehead, one white foot
- and a little white place on his back!

1394
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:18,160
It must be Black Beauty!

1395
02:11:18,160 --> 02:11:19,160
Beauty!

1396
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:20,160
Do you know me?

1397
02:11:20,160 --> 02:11:21,160
I'm little Joe Green, who almost killed you!'

1398
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:22,160
And he began patting me all over my back.

1399
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:23,160
I could not say I remembered him, as he was
now a fine young man with a black moustache

1400
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:24,160
and a deep voice.

1401
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:25,160
But I was sure he knew me, and that he was
Joe Green, and I was very glad.

1402
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:26,160
I put my nose up to him and tried to say that
we were friends.

1403
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:27,160
I never saw a man so pleased.

1404
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:28,160
That afternoon, I was harnessed to a carriage
for Miss Ellen to try me.

1405
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:29,160
Joe Green went with her and told her that
he was sure I was Mr Gordon's old Black Beauty.

1406
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:30,160
'I shall write to Mrs Gordon and tell her
that her favourite horse has come to us,'

1407
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:31,160
said Miss Ellen.

1408
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,420
'How pleased she will be!'

1409
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:38,650
I have now lived in this happy place a whole
year.

1410
02:11:38,650 --> 02:11:43,320
Joe is the best and kindest of grooms.

1411
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:52,020
My work is easy and pleasant, and I feel my
strength coming back again.

1412
02:11:52,020 --> 02:12:01,020
The ladies have promised that they will never
sell me, and so I have nothing to fear; and

1413
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:05,140
here my story ends.

1414
02:12:05,140 --> 02:12:17,460
My troubles are all over, and I am at home;
and often, before I am quite awake, I dream

1415
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:29,389
