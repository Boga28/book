CHAPTER ONE
Creativity

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:13,650
On a cool fall evening in 2008, four students
decided to change an industry. They were all

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,820
deep in debt, and they had all lost or broken
their glasses. They were shocked at how much

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,960
it would cost to replace them. One of them
had been wearing the same pair of broken,

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,250
and repaired, glasses for five years. He refused
to pay for an expensive new pair.

6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,640
Luxottica, the biggest company in the glasses
industry, controlled more than 80 percent

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,920
of the market. To make glasses cheaper, the
four students would need to fight a giant.

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,510
The four had watched Zappos change the shoe
market by selling shoes online, and they wondered

9
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,020
if they could do the same with glasses.

10
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:05,770
They discussed the idea with friends, most
of whom were very negative. Nobody would buy

11
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:13,860
glasses over the internet, they said. People
needed to try them first. OK, Zappos had done

12
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,430
it with shoes, but there were reasons why
it wouldn't work with glasses. "If this were

13
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,430
a good idea," people said, "someone would
have done it already."

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:32,810
None of the students had worked in internet
sales or technology, and they knew nothing

15
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:41,580
about glasses or fashion. But they agreed
to start a company. They decided to sell glasses

16
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:49,560
that would cost 500 dollars in stores for
95 dollars online, and they would also give

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,450
another pair of glasses to someone in the
poorer countries in the developing world for

18
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:03,940
each pair that they sold. They called their
company Warby Parker.

19
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,720
The most important part of the business would
be its website, and their Warby Parker website

20
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:18,230
was ready in February 2010. They expected
to sell one or two pairs of glasses a day,

21
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:26,390
but in less than one month, they had 20,000
customers on a waiting list.

22
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:34,650
In 2015, the magazine Fast Company published
its yearly list of the world's most innovative

23
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:42,480
companies. Warby Parker was the first company
on that list. In the three previous years,

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:51,430
the winners had been Google, Nike, and Apple
- companies with over 50,000 employees. Warby

25
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:59,150
Parker had just 500 employees, but in five
years, the company had given more than 1 million

26
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:06,490
free pairs of glasses to the developing world.
The company was making 100 dollars million

27
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,990
a year and was worth more than 1 billion dollars.

28
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:22,210
Back in 2009, one of those four students asked
me to invest in Warby Parker. I refused. It

29
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:28,510
was the worst financial decision I have ever
made. I needed to understand where I went

30
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,730
wrong.

31
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,650
Conformity and originality

32
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:46,430
Years ago, psychologists discovered that there
are two roads to success: conformity and originality.

33
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:52,599
Conformity means following the crowds down
the usual paths. Originality means taking

34
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:59,290
unusual roads and developing new ideas that
are accepted only by a few people, but that

35
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,240
succeed in the end.

36
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,120
Of course, nothing is completely original:
our ideas are affected by the world around

37
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:18,000
us. We all borrow thoughts, sometimes by accident,
sometimes not. What I mean here by "originality"

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,680
is introducing and advancing an idea that
is quite unusual in a particular area, and

39
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,980
may improve that area.

40
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:36,230
Originality begins with creativity: having
an idea that is both new and useful. But it

41
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:45,000
doesn't stop there. Originals are people who
can make their new idea really work. The Warby

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,620
Parker people had the originality to think
of selling glasses online, but they became

43
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:58,910
originals by taking action to make those glasses
cheap and easy to buy.

44
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:05,930
This book is about how we can all become more
original. There's a surprising clue in the

45
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,600
web browser that you use to search the internet.

46
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,310
The problem with defaults

47
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,270
In a recent research project, Michael Housman
was investigating why some people who worked

48
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:28,590
in customer call centers for big companies
stayed in their jobs longer than others. He

49
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:35,660
collected information on 30,000 employees
who answered phones for banks, airlines, and

50
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,560
cell phone companies. He expected to find
that their employment histories would give

51
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,230
him an answer. He thought people who had changed
jobs often in the past would leave their present

52
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,780
jobs more quickly. But that wasn't true.

53
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,660
Looking at his research, Housman noticed that
his team had collected information about the

54
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,650
internet browser that the employees had used
when they applied for their job. He didn't

55
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:12,680
think he would find anything interesting there,
but the results were amazing. Employees who

56
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:20,120
used Firefox or Chrome stayed in their jobs
15 percent longer than those who used Internet

57
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,820
Explorer or Safari.

58
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:31,310
Housman thought this was strange, so then
he looked at absences from work. Again, Firefox

59
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:38,820
and Chrome users were 19 percent less likely
to miss work than Internet Explorer and Safari

60
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,250
users.

61
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:47,720
Then Housman looked at how employees performed
in their jobs. The Firefox and Chrome users

62
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:56,340
had higher sales, and their call times were
shorter. Their customers were happier, too.

63
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,880
Housman knew it wasn't the web browser that
made these people good employees. What made

64
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:09,680
the difference was how they had gotten their
browsers. If you buy a PC, Internet Explorer

65
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,570
is built into Windows. If you buy a Mac, it
comes with Safari. But if you choose to use

66
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,130
Firefox or Chrome, you are not accepting the
default.

67
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:28,540
It's the same at work. The people who didn't
accept the default for their browser did their

68
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:35,400
jobs differently. They didn't always accept
the usual answers, and they helped their customers

69
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,699
with new ideas.

70
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:45,460
Accepting the default is easy, but it doesn't
ask us to look at new ways of doing things.

71
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:52,479
Before the four people behind Warby Parker
started to think about their company, they

72
00:07:52,479 --> 00:08:00,021
knew glasses were expensive, but that had
always been true. That was the default; everybody

73
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:06,320
thought there was a good reason why glasses
were expensive. After all, these are health

74
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,180
products: a doctor is selling them.

75
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:18,580
Then, Dave Gilboa, one of the four, was buying
an Apple iPhone. Why was this phone, a piece

76
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:26,060
of modern technology, cheaper than a simple
pair of glasses? Warby Parker decided to look

77
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,519
at the glasses industry more closely. One
company, Luxottica, was the biggest in the

78
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:41,269
market. Simply, Luxottica could charge what
it wanted: twenty times the cost of the glasses.

79
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:49,870
And this meant that a different company could
do things very differently.

80
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,819
Accepting defaults

81
00:08:52,819 --> 00:09:00,179
We begin to accept defaults when we are very
young. When researchers interviewed schoolteachers,

82
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:06,139
they asked them to list their favorite and
least favorite students. They then asked the

83
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:14,879
teachers which students had the most creativity,
and these were often the least favorite students.

84
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,279
Teachers found that the creative students
often made trouble, while most children learned

85
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,230
to do what the teacher wanted.

86
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,160
You might think it is the most intelligent
children who change the world when they become

87
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:36,790
adults. But that doesn't often happen. They
may become excellent doctors, but they don't

88
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:42,920
ask why some people cannot afford healthcare.
They may become lawyers who defend people

89
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:50,120
against unfair laws, but they don't question
the laws themselves. They may become teachers

90
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:58,480
who teach exciting lessons but without asking,
what their students really need to learn.

91
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,029
The problem for many intelligent children
is that we expect them to achieve. It becomes

92
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:11,730
so important for them to achieve that they
start to fear failure, which can hold back

93
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,019
creativity.

94
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:20,421
Fear of failure held back some of the most
original people in history, people who, instead

95
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:27,589
of pushing ahead with confidence, held themselves
back through fear of failure. They only took

96
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:33,389
action because other people persuaded them
to do so.

97
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:40,230
The men who signed the American Declaration
of Independence were not natural revolutionaries.

98
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:46,230
George Washington just wanted to go back to
his farm and only became involved because

99
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:54,050
John Adams asked him to command the army.
"I have used everything in my power to avoid

100
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,870
it," Washington wrote in a letter to his wife,
Martha, in 1766.

101
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:07,110
Two hundred years later, Martin Luther King,
Jr. wanted to work in the church and as a

102
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:14,509
teacher. But, when Rosa Parks refused to give
up her seat on a bus to a white man, some

103
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:22,360
people in Montgomery, Alabama, decided to
organize a group to support her. At a meeting,

104
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,880
someone suggested King as president of the
group. King didn't have time to think, and

105
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:36,079
he accepted. He said afterward that, if he
had had time to think, he would probably have

106
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,889
refused.

107
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:43,949
When the Church asked Michelangelo to paint
the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome,

108
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:51,559
he wasn't interested. He didn't want to take
on such a huge job and ran away to Florence.

109
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:59,519
But he was asked again and again, and after
two years he agreed to start work.

110
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:10,009
Nearly 500 years later, in 1977, an investor
offered Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak 250,000

111
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:17,489
dollars to help them start Apple. But the
investor demanded that Wozniak leave his job

112
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:24,629
at Hewlett- Packard. Wozniak was afraid to
leave his job, and he only agreed when he

113
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:31,399
was encouraged by Steve Jobs, other friends,
and his parents.

114
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:39,089
We can only wonder how many Kings, Michelangelos,
and Wozniaks had original ideas but were never

115
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:46,470
pushed to develop them. Many of us have ideas
to improve our workplaces or schools, but

116
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:53,309
we don't give voice to them. Originality can
get you into trouble, and most of us prefer

117
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:56,389
to conform.

118
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:01,720
What are the habits of people who are original,
and who take action to develop their original

119
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,620
ideas?

120
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,079
How to be an entrepreneur

121
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:17,519
To be an original you need to take big risks.
That's what most people think. We admire astronauts

122
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,579
like Neil Armstrong and Sally Ride, who left
the only planet we know and went bravely into

123
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:32,059
space. We admire leaders like Mahatma Gandhi
and Martin Luther King, Jr., who risked their

124
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:38,529
lives for the things they believed in. And
we admire entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and

125
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:44,660
Bill Gates, who dropped out of school and
worked in dark garages to develop the products

126
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,579
of the future.

127
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:54,220
The word "entrepreneur" was created by Richard
Cantillon, and it means someone who takes

128
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:01,319
risks. When we read about the rise of Warby
Parker, we see the four friends who started

129
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:08,639
the company as great risk-takers. But is it
true?

130
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,309
Six months before Warby Parker started business,
Neil Blumenthal, one of the four friends,

131
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:22,000
was one of my students. He came to see me
because he wanted me to invest in their company.

132
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,379
I told him that it was an interesting idea,
but I wasn't sure that people would buy glasses

133
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:35,100
online. As it would be difficult to persuade
people to buy online, I felt it would need

134
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,689
an enormous amount of work to get the company
going. And, when I discovered what Neil and

135
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:47,989
his friends were planning to do with their
own lives, I was even less sure.

136
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:54,320
The first problem was that Neil and his friends
were still in school. If they believed in

137
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,839
Warby Parker, they should all drop out and
work full time on Warby Parker.

138
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:07,040
"No," said Neil. "We're not sure it's a good
idea, and we don't know if we will succeed.

139
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,259
We're working on it in our spare time."

140
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:17,079
However, they were all finishing school at
the end of the year. So after that they could

141
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:19,779
work full time on the project.

142
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:26,309
"No," said Neil. "If things don't work out,
I'm taking a full-time job after I finish

143
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:30,149
school. And so are the others."

144
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:38,829
That was enough for me. I decided not to invest.
The Warby Parker friends did not fit my picture

145
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:46,100
of successful entrepreneurs. They weren't
prepared to risk everything on one idea. I

146
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,559
thought they were going to fail because they
didn't want any risk. But, in fact, that is

147
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,609
why they succeeded.

148
00:15:56,609 --> 00:16:04,119
In an interesting piece of research, Joseph
Raffiee and Jie Feng studied 5,000 entrepreneurs

149
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:11,970
over fourteen years. They wanted the answer
to one simple question. When people start

150
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:19,679
a business, is it better for them to leave
their present job, or to stay employed?

151
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,880
If you think like most people, you would expect
the risk-takers who leave their jobs to be

152
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:32,369
more successful. But the opposite happens.
Entrepreneurs who keep their original jobs

153
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:40,959
are 33 percent less likely to fail than the
risk-takers who leave their jobs.

154
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,609
If you don't like to take risks, and have
some doubts about your business, you will

155
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:51,720
build your business more carefully. If you
take risks in your life, then you may take

156
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,139
risks with your business, too.

157
00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:01,730
Like Warby Parker, many successful businesses
were started by people who did not give up

158
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:09,241
their jobs - at least at the beginning. After
inventing the first Apple I computer, Steve

159
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:17,370
Wozniak started Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976
but continued to work for Hewlett- Packard

160
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:26,829
until 1977. Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed
a better way to search the internet in 1996

161
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:34,260
but didn't stop work on their higher degrees
at Stanford University until 1998. They tried

162
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:41,380
to sell Google for less than 2 million dollar
in 1997 because their new company was making

163
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:48,300
it difficult to study -luckily, nobody made
an offer.

164
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:55,430
Brian May was doing a higher degree in physics
when he started to play guitar in a new band.

165
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:03,030
He continued to study for several years before
he started to play full time for Queen. Stephen

166
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:10,400
King worked in a gas station and as a teacher
for seven years after writing his first story.

167
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:18,500
He finally gave up work a year after his first
novel, Carrie, was published.

168
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:25,640
These people were all balancing their risk:
taking a big risk in one part of their lives

169
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:34,400
but playing safe with another. Keeping things
safe meant that there was space to be original.

170
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,150
And because the entrepreneurs were not taking
such a big financial risk there was more time

171
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:46,030
available: there was less danger of starting
the business with a poor-quality product in

172
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:53,290
an effort to get the money back quickly. As
Malcolm Gladwell wrote in the New Yorker,

173
00:18:53,290 --> 00:19:00,500
"Many entrepreneurs take plenty of risks - but
those are generally the failed entrepreneurs,

174
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,320
not the success stories."

175
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,320
From idea to action

176
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,640
Having revealed that successful originals
often begin by questioning defaults and balancing

177
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:23,560
risk, the rest of this book is about moving
from original ideas to action. I have spent

178
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:29,920
more than ten years researching originality
and studying some of the most successful originals

179
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:37,830
of our time. I want to share with you how
we can all be more original, without taking

180
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:44,940
too many risks with our personal, financial,
and professional lives. I hope that what I

181
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,780
have discovered will help people develop their
originality and will help leaders develop

182
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,290
originality in their organizations.

183
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:01,560
The first part of this book looks at how to
manage the risks in developing, recognizing,

184
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:09,850
and pushing forward original ideas. New ideas
are risky, and we need to learn how to recognize

185
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:18,510
good ideas and avoid the bad ones. Once you
are sure that you have a good idea, the next

186
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:25,080
step is to get other people to understand
it. You'll discover how the most popular television

187
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,910
show ever nearly didn't get made, and why
an entrepreneur told investors the reasons

188
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,680
why they shouldn't invest in his company.

189
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:42,150
The second part of this book looks at the
choices we need to make when developing original

190
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:49,220
ideas. There are the risks of being first
to the market: it's sometimes riskier to move

191
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:56,540
early than it is to be late. Delaying can
help entrepreneurs build businesses that are

192
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:04,500
stronger over time, and it can help originals
remain creative. I will also look at building

193
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:11,330
coalitions of people to work together, and
how sometimes it can be useful to work with

194
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,440
your enemies.

195
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,550
The third part of this book looks at how to
develop originality in children and explains

196
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:28,530
how our family, and others, make us more or
less likely to question defaults. You'll see

197
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:34,170
how whether or not baseball players are the
first child in a family affects the risks

198
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:40,770
that they take. I'll also look at how leaders
can encourage the development of creative

199
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,290
ideas in their companies.

200
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:51,510
To finish, I'll look at what stops us from
developing our originality. The originals

201
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:58,030
are the people who push us all forward. On
the inside, they are not that different from

202
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:04,880
the rest of us. They have the same fears and
doubts. What makes them different is that

203
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:13,050
they try, even though they have fears and
doubts. They know failure is a smaller disappointment

204
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:18,120
than failing to try.

205
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,210
CHAPTER TWO
Ideas and inventors

206
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:32,460
Around the year 2000, a lot of people in Silicon
Valley were very interested in a new invention.

207
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:39,380
Steve Jobs said it was the most exciting technology
since the computer. He offered the inventor

208
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:48,450
63 million dollars to buy 10 percent of the
company, but the inventor wasn't interested.

209
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:55,970
The man behind Amazon, Jeff Bezos, told the
inventor, "You have a product so revolutionary,

210
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,500
you'll have no problem selling it."

211
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,320
The inventor was described as a modern Thomas
Edison, and he was behind a number of exciting

212
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:13,130
medical inventions. He thought his new invention
would have sales of 10,000 a week in its first

213
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:21,300
year. But, after six years, he had only sold
30,000, and the company still wasn't making

214
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:29,710
money. The invention was expected to change
lives and cities around the world, but today

215
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,960
it is only used in a few special markets.

216
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:43,300
The revolutionary product was the Segway - a
machine with two wheels that carries you around.

217
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:51,050
Why did so many people think it was going
to be a success? Why did they get it wrong?

218
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:58,120
A few years earlier, two writers wrote a 90-minute
television program. They had never written

219
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,530
for television before, and they soon found
they didn't have enough material for 90 minutes,

220
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:11,510
so they decided to write a weekly half-hour
show. But when they sent their work to a television

221
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:17,930
company the people there either didn't like
it, or didn't understand it.

222
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:26,630
One program was made and shown to a test audience
of 100 people. The viewers didn't like it.

223
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:34,740
600 more people in four different cities watched
it. The report on those test audiences said:

224
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,630
"Nobody in the audience wanted to watch the
show again."

225
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:49,010
Surprisingly, the program did make it to television,
and, as expected, it wasn't successful. But

226
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:54,460
one person at the television company believed
in it and argued that they should try making

227
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:03,550
some more shows. These were made, and shown
a year later, and, again, they weren't popular.

228
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:09,600
The television company were going to cancel
the program but agreed to do a few more shows

229
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:16,200
when another program was canceled. One of
the writers almost left the show - he had

230
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,600
no more ideas.

231
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,700
It's a good thing he changed his mind. For
the next ten years, the program was one of

232
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:33,880
the most popular on television, and it made
more than 1 billion dollars. TV Guide named

233
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:40,800
it the greatest television program of all
time. Why did the television companies not

234
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,460
believe in Seinfeld?

235
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,610
When we say there is not enough originality
in the world we think it is because there

236
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:57,670
is not enough creativity. We think that if
only people had more new ideas we would be

237
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:07,510
better off. But the real problem is not new
ideas - it's selecting the right ideas. Our

238
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:13,650
companies and countries have many people with
new ideas. What they don't have are people

239
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:21,410
who can choose the right new ideas. Segway
was a false positive: people thought it would

240
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:29,500
be a success, but it wasn't. Seinfeld was
a false negative: people expected it to fail,

241
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,570
but it succeeded.

242
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:39,640
This chapter is about selecting the right
ideas. We'll look at two people who did expect

243
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,810
the Segway to fail, and at the one person
in the television company who believed in

244
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:52,690
Seinfeld. We'll see how these people made
the right decisions, and how we can become

245
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:58,750
better at choosing the right ideas.

246
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,010
Judging creativity

247
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:08,760
The inventor of the Segway was a brilliant
man called Dean Kamen. He had started inventing

248
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:17,280
when he was sixteen, and some of his inventions
were very successful. In the 1990s, he designed

249
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:25,400
the iBOT, a wheelchair that could climb stairs.
He realized that the technology of the iBOT

250
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:33,070
could be used more widely, and he put together
a team to design the Segway. He wanted something

251
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:39,280
that would be safe, friendly for the environment,
and would help people to move around busy

252
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:47,280
cities. Because it was small, light, and easy
to ride, it would be great for mail carriers,

253
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:55,420
police officers, and golfers, but it could
also change the way everybody traveled. The

254
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:01,641
Segway was the most amazing technology he
had ever created. Kamen thought it would,

255
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:08,460
replace the car, in the same way that the
car had replaced the horse.

256
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:15,220
But inventors are not the best people to judge
their own inventions. Studies show that most

257
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,160
of us are bad at judging ourselves. For example:

258
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:27,720
: 70 percent of high school seniors think
they are "above average" leaders; 2 percent

259
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,030
think they are below average

260
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:35,870
: 94 percent of college professors think their
work is above average

261
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:45,680
: in two different companies, 32 percent and
42 percent of engineers estimated they were

262
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,340
in the top 5 percent in their work.

263
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:57,750
When we have developed an idea, we are usually
too close to it to judge it accurately. In

264
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:04,370
music, many experts think Beethoven was a
good critic of his own music. But Beethoven's

265
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:12,230
own favorite pieces have not been the ones
played most. Aaron Kozbelt looked at letters

266
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:18,260
where Beethoven judged seventy of his works
and compared Beethoven's estimates with those

267
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:26,419
of other experts. Of those seventy works,
Beethoven estimated fifteen false positives

268
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:33,530
- works that he thought were important, but
that are not - and eight false negatives - works

269
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:41,059
that he thought unsuccessful, but that are
now judged very highly. That's 33 percent

270
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:47,210
wrong, even though Beethoven was judging his
work after audiences had heard and judged

271
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,710
it.

272
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,910
Kissing frogs

273
00:29:53,910 --> 00:30:00,650
If originals are not good at judging their
own work, how do they create great products?

274
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:08,280
They have a lot of ideas. Dean Simonton has
looked at many really successful creators

275
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:14,770
and discovered that they didn't have better
ideas than others; they had more. By producing

276
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:20,410
more ideas, they had a better chance of originality.

277
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:28,420
Think about William Shakespeare. In twenty
years, he wrote thirty-seven plays and 154

278
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:35,270
poems. In order to judge how popular they
were, Simonton looked at how often the plays

279
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:43,380
were performed. Three of Shakespeare's five
most popular plays, Macbeth, King Lear, and

280
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,860
Othello, were written in the same five years
that he wrote Timon of Athens and All's Well

281
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:55,180
That Ends Well, which many people feel are
among the worst of his plays.

282
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:03,800
Pablo Picasso produced more than 1,800 paintings,
12,000 drawings, and thousands of other works,

283
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:12,350
but only a small number of these are widely
admired. Albert Einstein published 248 papers

284
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:20,520
over his life, but most of them are not considered
important. We know Maya Angelou's poem "Still

285
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:27,120
I Rise" and her book I Know Why the Caged
Bird Sings, but we forget about her other

286
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:36,020
165 poems and six books. If you want to be
original, "the most important possible thing

287
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:43,650
you could do," says Ira Glass, "is do a lot
of work."

288
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:49,060
Many people think that if you want to do better
work you should do less and spend time on

289
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:58,900
delivering high-quality work. But having a
lot of ideas is the best way to get to quality.

290
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,559
Original thinkers will have many ideas that
are of no use, but, because they develop so

291
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:11,560
many ideas, it is more likely some of them
will be successful.

292
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:17,970
When he was developing the Segway, Dean Kamen
knew it was important to explore as many ideas

293
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:25,250
as possible. "You've got to kiss a lot of
frogs," he would say to his team, "before

294
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:32,380
you find a prince." He encouraged them to
look at hundreds of different ways of solving

295
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:40,020
the problems they met. The problem was that
he decided to develop the Segway without knowing

296
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:46,460
whether, in the end, it would be a frog or
a prince.

297
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:52,930
One of the best ways of judging our ideas
is to get feedback. One of the writers of

298
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:59,610
The Daily Show, Lizz Winstead, still doesn't
know, after years of working on the comedy

299
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:06,660
program, what will make people laugh. In the
past, she would try jokes out on stage, to

300
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:14,309
an audience. Some jokes made people laugh,
some didn't. Now, with social media she can

301
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:21,270
get feedback more quickly. When she thinks
of a joke, she shares it on Twitter. When

302
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:28,059
she has something longer to share, she uses
Facebook. At the end of the day, the feedback

303
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:33,330
tells her whether an idea is worth developing
or not.

304
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:39,580
When developing the Segway, Dean Kamen didn't
look for feedback. He was afraid that somebody

305
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:47,960
would steal his idea, so he kept the program
secret. Many of his own employees weren't

306
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:54,590
allowed to see the Segway while it was being
developed. So the team working on the Segway

307
00:33:54,590 --> 00:34:01,510
developed a huge number of ideas, but they
didn't get any feedback from customers. No

308
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,840
customers saw it when it was being developed.

309
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:12,399
But Kamen and his team weren't the only people
who were enthusiastic about the Segway. Why

310
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:19,909
did Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos make the same
mistake? To find the answer to that question,

311
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:25,559
let's first look at why so many people were
wrong about Seinfeld.

312
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:31,269
The danger of false negatives

313
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:36,339
When the television company first looked at
Seinfeld, they didn't know what to do with

314
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:42,929
it. It wasn't like other television programs.
They didn't want to take a risk on something

315
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:51,509
new like this. It would be better to develop
a safe idea than take a risk on this new one.

316
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:56,529
This way of thinking produces false negatives.

317
00:34:56,529 --> 00:35:02,799
The false negative is something that happens
often in the media. Film companies rejected

318
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:10,790
movies like Star Wars, E. T, and Pulp Fiction.
Publishers refused books like The Diary of

319
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:19,420
Anne Frank, Gone with the Wind, and Harry
Potter - by 2015, J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter

320
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:26,800
books had brought in over 25 billion dollars
and sold more copies than any book series

321
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:34,059
ever. And in business there are hundreds of
examples where employees were ordered to stop

322
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:41,650
work on projects that were later successful.
The Xbox was almost stopped by Microsoft,

323
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:49,470
and the laser printer was nearly canceled
by Xerox because it was too expensive.

324
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:57,099
When we see something unusual, we often refuse
it and look for reasons why it may fail. When

325
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:03,730
managers see something new, they compare it
to things that were successful in the past.

326
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:10,640
So some publishers thought Harry Potter was
too long for a children's book. And television

327
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,130
company managers thought Seinfeld was too
much about New York to be of interest to the

328
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,349
rest of the country.

329
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:25,640
Test audiences are no better than managers
at judging new television shows. They make

330
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:32,460
the same mistakes. When you watch a show at
home, in your living room, you get interested

331
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:39,799
in the story. If you laugh a lot, at the end
you will think it was funny. But in a test

332
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:46,410
audience you don't watch in the same way.
You know you are there to judge it, and so

333
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:53,670
you compare it with shows you know are funny.
Neither test audiences nor managers are a

334
00:36:53,670 --> 00:37:00,390
good way of deciding whether a show is funny
or not.

335
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:05,489
Wide experience and deep experience

336
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:11,549
When the test audiences were negative about
Seinfeld, the project nearly stopped. But

337
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:20,369
one man, Rick Ludwin, believed in it. Rick
Ludwin worked on special programs, not comedy,

338
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:27,970
so Seinfeld wasn't his department. But, because
his experience was in a different type of

339
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:35,400
television, he felt differently about the
project. Most comedy programs before Seinfeld

340
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:42,869
had a few complete stories, with endings,
inside 22 minutes of television. Seinfeld

341
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:50,290
started a lot more stories but sometimes didn't
finish them. That worried most television

342
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:58,210
managers, but Ludwin worked on specials, where
each program is organized in its own way.

343
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:05,799
Ludwin had written jokes for Bob Hope in the
1970s and had worked on comedies in the past.

344
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:11,881
Because Ludwin had some experience of comedy,
he understood how it worked. And, although

345
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:18,220
he hadn't worked in comedy for many years,
he had a wide experience of television, and

346
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:25,140
he was happy to explore new ways of making
people laugh. He combined a wide experience

347
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:31,539
of television outside of comedy with a deep
experience of comedy from his days writing

348
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:40,460
jokes. And combining wide and deep experience
is very important for creativity.

349
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:50,200
A recent study looked at every Nobel Prize-winning
scientist from 1901 to 2005 and compared them

350
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:57,380
with other scientists who had not won Nobel
Prizes. Both groups knew their science well

351
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:04,509
- they had deep experience. But the Nobel
Prize winners were more likely to be doing

352
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:11,609
other, artistic, things as well. Here's what
the fifteen researchers at Michigan State

353
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:24,349
University found when they compared the Nobel
Prize winners with the 

354
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:59,460
other scientists.

355
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:06,651
A study of thousands of Americans showed similar
results for entrepreneurs and inventors. These

356
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:13,579
people were more likely than others to take
part in activities like drawing, painting,

357
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,720
or writing.

358
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,970
In a study of the fashion industry, a team
of researchers led by Frederic Godart looked

359
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:29,289
at the cultural experience of fashion designers.
The most creative work came from designers

360
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:35,809
who had worked in foreign countries, but Godart
found three especially interesting things

361
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,410
about this experience.

362
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:45,479
Firstly, living in a foreign country didn't
help creativity. It was working there that

363
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:51,990
was important. The most original work came
from designers who had worked in two or three

364
00:40:51,990 --> 00:41:01,160
different countries. Secondly, the more foreign
the country the better. For an American, working

365
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:10,800
in Canada didn't help a lot. Working in Korea
or Japan helped more with originality. Thirdly,

366
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:18,089
the experience was better if it was deep.
A few weeks wasn't useful; the most creative

367
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:24,430
designers had spent thirty-five years working
in other countries.

368
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:30,019
Where Steve Jobs went wrong

369
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:36,930
When Steve Jobs first got on a Segway, he
refused to climb off. When Dean Kamen wanted

370
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:44,280
other investors to try it, Jobs let them,
but soon got back on again. He invited Kamen

371
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:53,390
to dinner and told him his Segway was as original
as the computer, and he wanted to be involved.

372
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:59,049
Steve Jobs was famous for making decisions
through intuition, rather than investigating

373
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:07,390
carefully. Why did he get it wrong this time?
There were three main reasons: he didn't have

374
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:13,440
experience of this area of business; he felt
too confident because of his success in other

375
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,829
areas of business; and he was very enthusiastic.

376
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:26,650
Let's start with experience. Jobs and the
other early investors in Segway, like Jeff

377
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:34,029
Bezos, knew nothing about transportation.
They were originals in their area, but that

378
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:41,809
did not make them good in other areas. Intuition
can be helpful, but it works best when we

379
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:47,769
have experience of what we are looking at.
The Segway was a brilliant machine, and it

380
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:54,380
was huge fun to ride it. But it was difficult
for people with no transportation experience

381
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,489
to judge it.

382
00:42:57,489 --> 00:43:04,050
One man who did understand the problems with
Segway was Randy Komisar. He looked at the

383
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:10,390
transportation market and realized that the
Segway wasn't going to replace the car: it

384
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:17,720
would replace walking or cycling. But he didn't
think it was a product many people would want.

385
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:23,390
It was exciting to ride, but it was a lot
of money to pay for something that replaced

386
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:30,920
walking. And, at that time, nobody knew whether
governments would allow it on sidewalks. Komisar

387
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:38,390
thought there would be a market in mail or
police services, or for golfers. But Jobs

388
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:43,140
still thought that Segway was too exciting
to fail.

389
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:50,390
Jobs' next problem was that he had been very
successful in one area of business, so he

390
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:57,479
thought he understood all areas of business.
The more successful people are in the past,

391
00:43:57,479 --> 00:44:03,720
the worse they perform when they work in a
new area. He was so sure his intuition was

392
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:11,970
right that he didn't check his intuition with
people who understood transportation.

393
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:17,890
When Kamen talked with investors like Jobs
about Segway, he spoke about countries like

394
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:25,450
China and India, which were building cities
the size of New York every year. These cities

395
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:33,479
would be full of cars, and that would be really
bad for the environment. He was enthusiastic,

396
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:41,240
and the investors liked that enthusiasm. When
we look at a new idea, the enthusiasm of the

397
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:48,289
inventor can make a big difference. Enthusiasm
is important for inventors, but entrepreneurs

398
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:53,079
need to be more careful.

399
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:56,880
Thoughts on selecting ideas

400
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:04,640
My failure to invest in Warby Parker was a
big false negative. I had never owned glasses,

401
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:11,150
so it was hard for me to think about people
who did. I had deep experience of glasses:

402
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:17,269
I had spent two years doing research in a
company that made and sold glasses through

403
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:24,839
stores. But I didn't have wide experience.
Three of the four men behind Warby Parker

404
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:32,900
wore glasses, and the fourth, Neil Blumenthal,
had worked for five years in Asia, Africa,

405
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:38,920
and Latin America, helping women to start
businesses. One of the businesses he helped

406
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:45,039
with was selling glasses, so he knew that
glasses could be made much more cheaply than

407
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,210
people think.

408
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:54,920
The Warby Parker entrepreneurs were also careful
to get everybody in the company involved in

409
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:01,750
development. Nothing was secret, and ideas
were shared on a Google document, where everybody

410
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:09,749
in the company could read them. And people
could give feedback on new ideas as they appeared.

411
00:46:09,749 --> 00:46:17,020
If Segway had done the same as Warby Parker,
they may have avoided some of their problems.

412
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:25,390
But Kamen is still a great inventor, especially
in the area of healthcare. As an inventor,

413
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:31,440
he should be having the great ideas but then
sharing them with others and getting feedback

414
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,670
on which inventions are the most useful.

415
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:45,529
In 2013, 300,000 patents were taken out in
the United States. The chances that any of

416
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:53,170
these inventions will change the world are
tiny. One creative inventor, with lots of

417
00:46:53,170 --> 00:47:01,119
inventions, has a better chance that one invention
over his or her whole life will make a difference.

418
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,930
And when we judge these inventors, we don't
look at their least successful ones: we look

419
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:11,190
at the best.

420
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,130
CHAPTER THREE
Speaking the truth

421
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:25,210
In the early 1990s, a CIA (Central Intelligence
Agency) employee called Carmen Medina worked

422
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:32,190
in Europe for three years. When she returned
to the United States, she found that leaving

423
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:37,630
the United States had made it difficult to
get an interesting job in the CIA, and she

424
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:42,229
began to look for other ways to help the organization.

425
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:48,369
During the time she worked for the CIA in
Europe, she had noticed that there was a big

426
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:56,730
problem with information sharing in the organization.
Information was shared by "finished intelligence

427
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:03,960
reports," which were sent out once a day.
The experts who wrote them had no way of sharing

428
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:11,450
ideas before the reports went out. Things
change very quickly in intelligence, and it

429
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:19,069
was taking too long for the right information
to reach the right people. Carmen Medina suggested

430
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:25,680
that, instead of using printed-paper documents,
departments could put their ideas immediately

431
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,109
on to Intelink, a secret internet used by
the CIA.

432
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:38,109
Her managers weren't interested. The internet
was dangerous, and intelligence had to be

433
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:45,900
secret. With printed documents, you could
be sure the right people had the right information.

434
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:52,489
It would be very dangerous if the wrong people
got secret information.

435
00:48:52,489 --> 00:49:00,789
Medina kept talking about her idea, but everybody
told her to be quiet. Finally, she decided

436
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:08,549
to leave the CIA, but she couldn't find another
job. She ended up working in a boring CIA

437
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:16,719
desk job, and she kept quiet about her idea
for a while. Three years later, she decided

438
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:22,410
to argue again for online information sharing.

439
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:29,880
Less than ten years later, Carmen Medina was
involved in creating Intellipedia, a Wikipedia

440
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:38,219
for intelligence organizations. It allowed
departments to read reports from other organizations.

441
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:44,029
It was a big change to the secret culture
of the CIA, and it helped with intelligence

442
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:52,700
for the Beijing Olympics and after the Mumbai
attacks in 2008. In a few years, Intellipedia

443
00:49:52,700 --> 00:50:01,440
had half a million users and over 1 million
pages. It achieved this very quickly and very

444
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,789
cheaply, too.

445
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:10,280
Why did Medina fail the first time she talked
about information sharing, and why was she

446
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:19,640
heard the second time? In between, the world
had changed. The internet was much more widely

447
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:26,849
used, and the attacks of September 11, 2001
made it clear that intelligence organizations

448
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:33,779
needed to be better at sharing information.
Medina had also become deputy director of

449
00:50:33,779 --> 00:50:41,249
intelligence at the CIA, which gave her the
power to follow her idea. She got that position

450
00:50:41,249 --> 00:50:48,440
by learning to speak in ways that made people
listen to her and believe her.

451
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:54,329
We have all sometimes wanted to speak about
something that seems wrong either inside or

452
00:50:54,329 --> 00:51:03,230
outside of an organization. This chapter is
about how to do this well, and without risks.

453
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:10,290
What are the right times to speak, and how
can we make sure people hear us? As well as

454
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:16,410
Carmen Medina, we'll hear about an entrepreneur
who tells investors why they shouldn't invest

455
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:23,750
in his companies; a manager who argued with
Steve Jobs; and why managers who appear to

456
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:32,260
support you sometimes provide the least support.
We'll also see how gender and race affect

457
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:39,190
our ability to be heard, and why the photos
we like of ourselves are the opposite of the

458
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:42,660
ones we like of our friends.

459
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:48,219
Power without status

460
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:56,309
Leaders and managers like it when employees
offer help, do research, or ask for feedback.

461
00:51:56,309 --> 00:52:04,059
But there's one thing that is not so popular:
making suggestions. In one piece of research

462
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:10,339
in an industry, it was found that the more
employees made suggestions to their managers

463
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:15,259
the less likely they were to get promoted.

464
00:52:15,259 --> 00:52:21,969
To understand what happens in organizations
when people like Carmen Medina object to something,

465
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:29,539
we need to think about power and status. Power
is being able to control what other people

466
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:38,490
do; status is being admired by other people.
When people without status make suggestions,

467
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:43,650
we don't think they should tell us what to
do, and we refuse. That is what happened to

468
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:51,599
Carmen Medina; her years working outside of
the United States meant she had low status.

469
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:57,329
She hadn't been able to show people what she
could really do, so people didn't value her

470
00:52:57,329 --> 00:52:59,549
ideas.

471
00:52:59,549 --> 00:53:05,460
Years later, she had earned status because
she had slowly gotten jobs with more responsibility

472
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:12,509
in the organization. Then she got a job where
she had to protect sensitive information.

473
00:53:12,509 --> 00:53:20,029
Now, when she talked about sharing information,
it was part of her job. People saw that she

474
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:27,499
stood for something and not against it. They
started to admire her work, and this made

475
00:53:27,499 --> 00:53:35,769
it possible for her ideas to be seen as original.
We don't like originality in low-status people,

476
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:42,200
but we admire it when their status is high.

477
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,819
The Sarick Effect

478
00:53:45,819 --> 00:53:52,739
After having their first child, Rufus Griscom
and Alisa Volkman were shocked by the false

479
00:53:52,739 --> 00:53:59,690
advertising and bad advice being offered to
parents. They started an online magazine called

480
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:08,130
Babble that aimed to tell the truth about
being a parent. In 2009, when Griscom tried

481
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:14,349
to get investors for the project, he did the
opposite to what every entrepreneur is taught

482
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:22,880
to do. He told the investors the top five
reasons for not investing in his business.

483
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:29,210
That should have killed the idea. Investors
are looking for reasons to say yes, and he

484
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:35,519
was giving them reasons to say no. Entrepreneurs
are supposed to talk about the great things

485
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:45,950
in the company, and he was doing the opposite.
But it worked. That year, Babble got 3.3 million

486
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,109
dollars from investors.

487
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:55,769
Two years later, Griscom went to see Disney
to see if they were interested in buying Babble.

488
00:54:55,769 --> 00:55:02,849
He did the same thing again and told them:
"Here's why you should not buy Babble.'' Then

489
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:09,089
he explained that people who looked at the
Babble website didn't stay very long. And

490
00:55:09,089 --> 00:55:14,890
Babble was supposed to be for parents, but
40 percent of the messages people wrote on

491
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:22,190
it weren't about parents at all. What's more,
the technology behind the website needed some

492
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:30,339
serious work. Disney bought the company, for
40 million dollars.

493
00:55:30,339 --> 00:55:37,459
This is called the Sarick Effect, after Leslie
Sarick. Griscom was talking to people who

494
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:44,509
had more power than him. He was asking them
to give him money. Usually you would tell

495
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:50,269
people what was good about your project, but
that only works when people are already on

496
00:55:50,269 --> 00:55:56,980
your side. When you're talking to investors,
they are looking for reasons why your idea

497
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:05,890
won't work. In that situation, it may be better
to talk about what is wrong with your idea.

498
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:11,019
Here are four reasons why the Sarick Effect
can work.

499
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:17,239
First, beginning with what is weak about a
business helps to put the audience on your

500
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:25,459
side. When we know somebody is trying to push
us into buying something we usually refuse.

501
00:56:25,459 --> 00:56:31,170
But when Griscom said the words "Here's why
you shouldn't buy this company," they laughed

502
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:36,729
and then relaxed. He had given them a problem
to solve.

503
00:56:36,729 --> 00:56:44,319
Second, talking about what is wrong with an
idea makes you look intelligent. People who

504
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:50,529
say and write negative things are usually
seen to be more intelligent than people who

505
00:56:50,529 --> 00:56:57,559
say and write positive things. When you say
something negative about an idea, it shows

506
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:04,369
you have thought about it. In Griscom's case,
it showed he knew there were problems, and

507
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:07,460
he wasn't trying to hide them.

508
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:13,530
Third, talking about the problems with your
business means that investors will trust you

509
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:21,259
more. When Griscom talked about his problems,
it made him look honest. Of course, talking

510
00:57:21,259 --> 00:57:27,249
about the problems doesn't work if your audience
doesn't know about them, but Griscom's audiences

511
00:57:27,249 --> 00:57:33,009
were going to give him a lot of money. They
were looking at his business very carefully,

512
00:57:33,009 --> 00:57:40,519
so he couldn't hide the problems anyway; they
would find them. Also, investors thought that,

513
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:46,009
if he was admitting what was wrong with his
business, there was probably a lot that was

514
00:57:46,009 --> 00:57:48,039
right.

515
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:56,289
Fourth, audiences are more likely to support
an idea when the problems are made clear.

516
00:57:56,289 --> 00:58:01,579
When Griscom told investors about the problems
with the business, it made it difficult for

517
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:07,269
them to think of other problems with it, and
they began to think that maybe Griscom's problems

518
00:58:07,269 --> 00:58:11,799
weren't too bad.

519
00:58:11,799 --> 00:58:15,849
The unfamiliarity problem

520
00:58:15,849 --> 00:58:21,450
When you have spent weeks, months, or even
years thinking about your idea, you know it

521
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:27,490
perfectly. It's not possible to imagine what
the idea sounds like to someone who is hearing

522
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:36,539
it for the first time. So we often present
our ideas to people without enough information.

523
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:42,829
If we want people to accept our original ideas,
we need to speak about them often, and then

524
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:54,559
repeat what we said. To illustrate, which
of these two words do you like better?

525
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:59,359
If you're like most people, you will choose
sarick.

526
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:07,259
Robert Zajonc has described this. He showed
people nonsense words like iktitaf and sarick

527
00:59:07,259 --> 00:59:14,019
and asked them which they preferred. If they
had never seen either word before, they liked

528
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:20,329
them equally. But when they had seen one of
the words twice before the test, they preferred

529
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:28,279
that one. And if they had seen it five, ten,
or twenty-five times, they liked it even more.

530
00:59:28,279 --> 00:59:35,631
I used sarick four times earlier. There is
nothing called the Sarick Effect, and there

531
00:59:35,631 --> 00:59:42,009
is nobody called Leslie Sarick. I invented
them to show how seeing the word already can

532
00:59:42,009 --> 00:59:50,579
affect you. (Rufus Griscom is real, however,
and so is everyone else in this book.)

533
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:57,729
My favorite test of this is when people looked
at photographs of themselves and their friends.

534
00:59:57,729 --> 01:00:04,599
Some of the photos were inverted - as though
in a mirror - and some were not. People liked

535
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:09,739
the photos of their friends when they weren't
inverted - because that's how they are used

536
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:15,950
to seeing them. But they preferred photos
of themselves that were inverted - because

537
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:20,859
we're used to seeing ourselves in the mirror.

538
01:00:20,859 --> 01:00:28,240
One reason for this is that the idea or picture
we're used to is easier to understand. Something

539
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:36,259
that we don't know takes more effort, and
that makes us uncomfortable.

540
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:39,989
Making people uncomfortable

541
01:00:39,989 --> 01:00:45,990
When Carmen Medina made no progress the first
time she talked about information sharing,

542
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:52,789
she thought about leaving the CIA. She stayed,
but she didn't speak up to her managers again

543
01:00:52,789 --> 01:01:00,150
about her ideas for a long time. When she
did, it was because of her manager, Mike.

544
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:08,609
I guessed Mike would be a friendly, relaxed
man, but he was the opposite. He was not friendly,

545
01:01:08,609 --> 01:01:16,089
and he got angry quickly. So why was he the
right manager for Medina?

546
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:23,279
Although he was a difficult man, Mike did
care about the future of the organization.

547
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:28,410
Friendly people like everyone around them
to be happy, so they are less likely to push

548
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:36,260
difficult ideas forward. A man like Mike didn't
mind making people uncomfortable, so he was

549
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:43,470
ready to give Medina time to develop her uncomfortable
ideas.

550
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:48,509
Another thing that Medina noticed was that
middle managers were the most unhappy with

551
01:01:48,509 --> 01:01:55,789
her ideas. It is often the people in the middle
who don't want to make difficulties. They

552
01:01:55,789 --> 01:02:01,769
have made some progress in the organization
and don't want to go backward.

553
01:02:01,769 --> 01:02:07,849
The difficulties of speaking up

554
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:13,869
Speaking up to, an audience of middle managers
is always a risk, but it was especially difficult

555
01:02:13,869 --> 01:02:20,229
for Carmen Medina because she was a woman
in an organization where most of the employees

556
01:02:20,229 --> 01:02:27,600
were men. I thought the days when women could
not speak up in work were in the past. But

557
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:35,599
I soon realized there is still a problem with
gender. In organizations around the world,

558
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:42,719
people expect men to speak up, and to lead.
But when women speak up they can be seen as

559
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:45,479
angry.

560
01:02:45,479 --> 01:02:52,029
When I looked at my own research, I was very
disappointed. In an international bank and

561
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:59,119
a healthcare company, I found that suggesting
good ideas led to promotions for men, but

562
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:07,069
not for women. Other research shows that male
employees who talk more than others are rewarded

563
01:03:07,069 --> 01:03:16,059
and promoted. But women who talk more are
judged negatively by both men and women. When

564
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:21,989
women suggest changing something at work to
improve it, their bosses don't trust them

565
01:03:21,989 --> 01:03:26,420
and are not as likely to change anything.

566
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:32,259
There is no doubt things were difficult for
Medina because she was a woman in an organization

567
01:03:32,259 --> 01:03:41,369
of mostly men. But she was also a Puerto Rican.
Being from two groups like this makes a difference.

568
01:03:41,369 --> 01:03:48,299
Ashleigh Rosette, an African-American researcher,
found that people behaved differently when

569
01:03:48,299 --> 01:03:56,940
she spoke up than when white women and black
men did. When black women leaders failed,

570
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:03,640
they were judged harder than black men, or
than white men and women.

571
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:08,809
The road not taken

572
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:17,289
In 1985, Donna Dubinsky was working as Apple's
distribution and sales manager. It was a busy

573
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:25,460
job, as sales of Apple computers were increasing
quickly. Then Steve Jobs suggested that Apple

574
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:33,420
stop using its six distribution centers and
move to "just-in-time" distribution: computers

575
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:38,140
would be finished in the factory when they
were needed and would be delivered to customers

576
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,759
direct from the factory.

577
01:04:41,759 --> 01:04:49,069
Dubinsky thought this was a big mistake. She
knew that Apple's success depended on successful

578
01:04:49,069 --> 01:04:56,989
distribution. She objected, but nobody listened.
For several months, she worked in a group

579
01:04:56,989 --> 01:05:02,810
that looked at just-in-time distribution.
Everyone seemed happy to go ahead with the

580
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:11,209
new just-in-time system, except Dubinsky.
She spoke up against the idea and told Apple

581
01:05:11,209 --> 01:05:16,790
they must give her thirty days to create a
different system - and if they didn't give

582
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:20,999
it to her she would leave.

583
01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:28,660
She was taking a big risk, but she was given
the time. At the end of the thirty days, she

584
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:35,749
suggested a new distribution system, and it
was accepted. People knew she had done a good

585
01:05:35,749 --> 01:05:43,089
job in the past - she had status. Many people
would think that arguing with Steve Jobs,

586
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:50,079
known as a difficult man, would not be a good
idea. But Jobs liked people who argued with

587
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:57,719
him, and he was open to new ways of doing
things. And Dubinsky wasn't doing it for herself,

588
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:03,489
she was doing it for Apple. Jobs understood
that.

589
01:06:03,489 --> 01:06:12,410
In 1991, Dubinsky left Apple. She met Jeff
Hawkins and joined Palm Computing, which produced

590
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:20,980
the PalmPilot, one of the first small handheld
computers. But when Palm was bought by 3Com

591
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:27,829
she was again unhappy with the management.
She and Hawkins left to start a new company,

592
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:35,329
Handspring, which made handheld computers
and developed a smartphone. A few years later,

593
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:39,589
Apple developed the iPhone.

594
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:47,369
Medina had wanted to leave the CIA but couldn't.
That was why she stayed and, in the end, changed

595
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:55,259
the organization from the inside. Dubinsky
did leave and helped to begin the smartphone

596
01:06:55,259 --> 01:07:03,339
revolution. Although Medina stayed and Dubinsky
left, they both chose to speak up rather than

597
01:07:03,339 --> 01:07:07,859
remain silent.

598
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:10,130
CHAPTER FOUR
Taking time

599
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:19,769
Late at night in a hotel room, a young man
stared at an empty piece of paper on the desk.

600
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:27,210
Nervously, he called a friend in a room several
floors down to talk through some ideas. The

601
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:34,910
friend ran up the stairs to discuss a speech
that would change history. At 3 a.m. the young

602
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:44,910
man was still working. It was August 1963,
and, although he expected to speak to 100,000

603
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:51,170
people in Washington the next day, Martin
Luther King, Jr. still hadn't finished his

604
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:52,319
speech.

605
01:07:52,319 --> 01:08:00,280
"He worked on it all night, not sleeping,"
King's wife, Coretta, remembered. "He was

606
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:06,339
to be the final speaker, and his words would
be carried on television and radio to millions

607
01:08:06,339 --> 01:08:12,140
of people in America and across the world."

608
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:19,920
The speech had been announced two months earlier,
and King knew how important it would be. It

609
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:28,089
would only be five minutes long, so he had
to be very careful in choosing his words.

610
01:08:28,089 --> 01:08:32,800
You might think he would begin writing the
speech immediately, as soon as he knew about

611
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:41,830
it. But he didn't begin writing until 10 p.m.
the night before.

612
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:47,930
Parents and teachers usually ask children
to begin work on their homework early, instead

613
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:54,950
of waiting until the last minute. But maybe
it was because King procrastinated that he

614
01:08:54,950 --> 01:09:02,640
gave the best speech of his life. I've studied
originals for a long time, and I've learned

615
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:10,020
that arriving early is not always a good thing.
It's sometimes better to arrive at the last

616
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,880
minute.

617
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,790
This chapter looks at the question of when
to take original action. I'll discuss how

618
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:27,190
delaying can be useful, and why procrastinating
can be a good thing. I'll look at how entrepreneurs

619
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:33,670
who are first to market with a product can
have difficulties; why older innovators are

620
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:40,720
sometimes better than younger ones; and how
leaders who want to change things wait patiently

621
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:47,790
for the right time. You don't have to be first
to be an original; you don't even have to

622
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:56,290
arrive on time. Originals are often late to
the party.

623
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:57,310
Great procrastinators

624
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:07,601
Recently, a student of mine, Jihae Shin, came
to me with an interesting idea: procrastinating

625
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:15,291
might be good for originality. When you procrastinate
you may be thinking about the thing you have

626
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:22,560
to do, but you delay doing it. Shin wondered
whether the delay meant that you had time

627
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:30,420
to think about a number of different possibilities,
rather than just one idea. As a result, you

628
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:37,790
may have more original ideas. I asked her
to test her theory.

629
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:44,620
There was an empty building at college, where
there had been a small food store. Shin asked

630
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:52,290
students to write ideas for using the empty
space. When the students started work immediately,

631
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:57,830
most of their ideas weren't very original
- they suggested things like another food

632
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:06,940
store. But Shin asked some students to procrastinate
by giving them computer games to play first.

633
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:13,670
The business ideas these students produced
were more original. The ideas from the procrastinators

634
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:18,150
were 28 percent more original.

635
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:25,460
We were excited by these results but wondered
whether playing the games had helped creativity.

636
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:32,180
But when people played games before they were
asked for ideas, it didn't help originality.

637
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:39,910
It also didn't help to start work, then stop
and take a break, and then return to work.

638
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:46,460
Once the students had started work, they had
made too much progress to stop and start again.

639
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:54,470
They had to know what was wanted, and to procrastinate,
in order to have the most creative ideas.

640
01:11:54,470 --> 01:12:02,620
Shin then did some more research, looking
at a Korean furniture company. Managers thought

641
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:10,080
employees who procrastinated a lot were more
original than those who didn't. But procrastinating

642
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:17,980
wasn't always a good thing: if the employees
weren't really determined to solve a big problem,

643
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:25,310
delaying just made things late. But, when
they were excited about looking for new ideas,

644
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:27,450
procrastination helped a lot.

645
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:35,970
Leonardo da Vinci was a famous procrastinator.
Experts think he took sixteen years to paint

646
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:43,230
the Mona Lisa, stopping and starting many
times. He also spent fifteen years thinking

647
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:50,120
about The Last Supper, working on many other
things at the same time.

648
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:57,460
In American history, there may be only one
speech as famous as King's: Abraham Lincoln's

649
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:06,820
Gettysburg Address. In just 272 words, Lincoln
made clear that the Civil War was about freedom

650
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:14,810
and equality. Lincoln was invited to give
the speech two weeks earlier. By the day before,

651
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:20,570
he had only written about half of the speech.
He didn't write the last paragraph until the

652
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:27,790
night before, and he didn't finish it until
the morning. He waited because he wanted to

653
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:32,210
be sure the speech was right.

654
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:38,040
In the summer before his "I have a dream"
speech, King got advice from three people

655
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:44,560
about what he should say - and how. He also
discussed the speech for a long time with

656
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:51,710
Clarence Jones, who had written some of his
other speeches. Jones and another man began

657
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:59,120
to write some ideas for the speech. King waited
until the last four days before he began to

658
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:06,000
work on the speech. Then, the night before,
he met with his advisors, and they started

659
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,350
again.

660
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:15,520
By delaying the work on the speech, King was
giving an example of the Zeigarnik effect.

661
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:22,230
The Russian psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik showed
that people remember unfinished things better

662
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:30,060
than finished things. Once something is finished,
we stop thinking about it. But if it's not

663
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:36,970
finished, it is still there in our minds.
When King finally asked Jones to write the

664
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:44,610
complete speech, he had a wide range of ideas.
But that wasn't the only good thing about

665
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:46,500
procrastinating.

666
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:51,510
"I have a dream"

667
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:58,510
Fifty years after King's famous speech, we
can all remember four words: "I have a dream."

668
01:14:58,510 --> 01:15:05,270
I was very surprised when I looked at the
speech King had written, and the words were

669
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:12,100
not there. Jones didn't put them in, and King
did not add them.

670
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:20,020
While he was speaking, the singer Mahalia
Jackson was behind him. She shouted, "Tell

671
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:28,610
them about the dream, Martin." He continued
with his speech, but she shouted it again.

672
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:36,280
In front of a crowd of 250,000, with millions
more watching on television, King pushed his

673
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:42,240
notes to one side and talked about his dream.

674
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:48,350
According to Drew Hansen in his book, The
Dream, King was still cutting out lines and

675
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:55,150
writing new ones just before he started to
speak. He was even making changes as he walked

676
01:15:55,150 --> 01:16:02,270
up to give the speech. And he didn't read
the words exactly, he changed things slightly,

677
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:09,370
like a jazz musician. It was eleven minutes
into the speech that he started to talk about

678
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:17,730
his dream, and he added so much to the speech
that he spoke for much longer than expected.

679
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:24,980
King had procrastinated, but he had given
more than 350 speeches in the year before

680
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:31,790
the "I have a dream" speech. He had material
in his head that he could use when he needed

681
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:41,110
it. He put his speeches together from pieces
of all his other speeches.

682
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:44,710
Pioneers and settlers

683
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:50,330
After working on starting over one hundred
new companies, Bill Gross did some research

684
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:58,010
to find out why some companies succeeded and
others failed. The biggest reasons were not

685
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:04,730
the quality of the ideas, the people in the
team, or the amount of money invested. "The

686
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:13,110
number one thing was timing," Gross said.
42 percent of the difference between success

687
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:17,370
and failure was timing.

688
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:23,240
Most Americans believe it is better to be
the first mover. We want to be leaders, not

689
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:29,090
followers. If you are the first to market
with a new product, you can learn about the

690
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:37,011
market more quickly and get the most customers.
By doing that you stop the competition, because

691
01:17:37,011 --> 01:17:42,450
it will be hard to persuade those customers
to change.

692
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:49,150
In a famous study, researchers Peter Colder
and Gerard Tellis compared the success of

693
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:57,290
companies that were either pioneers or settlers.
Pioneers were the first movers: the first

694
01:17:57,290 --> 01:18:04,980
company to make or sell a product. The settlers
arrived later; they waited for the pioneers

695
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:12,490
to create a market first. When Golder and
Tellis looked at hundreds of products in more

696
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:20,550
than thirty different areas of business they
found a huge difference in failures: 47 percent

697
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:28,770
for pioneers and just 8 percent for settlers.
And even when the pioneers did survive they

698
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:36,540
only got around 10 percent of the market compared
with 28 percent for settlers.

699
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:44,730
Surprisingly, the problems for the first mover
are often huge. Pioneers may sometimes get

700
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:51,460
a big part of the market, but they usually
have a big risk of not surviving, and they

701
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:58,980
often don't make much money. If you're thinking
of moving into a new area of business, you

702
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:08,600
need to stop and think about timing. But researcher
Lisa Bolton found something more frightening.

703
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:15,070
Even when entrepreneurs know it is risky to
be the first mover, they don't believe it.

704
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:21,770
We can all think of pioneers who succeeded,
and we've forgotten those who failed. So what

705
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:26,910
are the reasons that settlers do better than
pioneers?

706
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:33,100
First, many people think that settlers are
just copying the pioneers, but that isn't

707
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:40,690
really true. They may be waiting before introducing
something new. They may be working on something

708
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:48,120
that is better than the products in the market
now. In home video games, the pioneer was

709
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:57,910
Magnavox Odyssey, which started with simple
sports games in 1972. A settler, Nintendo,

710
01:19:57,910 --> 01:20:06,250
started to manage the distribution for Odyssey
in Japan in 1975 and then, in the 1980s, started

711
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:14,380
to sell the Nintendo Entertainment System,
with games like Super Mario Bros. Nintendo's

712
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:20,810
games improved on the older games; it was
easier to play them, and the characters were

713
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:28,610
interesting. You don't have to be first to
be original. You have to be different and

714
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:32,060
better.

715
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:39,890
In the 1990s, a banker, Joseph Park, was at
home in his apartment. He was annoyed because

716
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:46,200
he wanted to stay home and watch a movie,
but to do that he had to go out to a store

717
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:53,460
and rent one. Why couldn't he go to a website,
choose a movie, and have it delivered to his

718
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:59,700
door? As there didn't seem to be a company
that provided this service, Park decided to

719
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:02,810
create one.

720
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:10,670
Although Park collected 250 million dollars
from investors, his company, Kozmo, only survived

721
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:19,620
until 2001. The biggest mistake was that Kozmo
promised to deliver movies in one hour, and

722
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:25,940
spent a lot of money on distribution to try
and make that possible. If Park had moved

723
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:34,030
more slowly, he might have realized that delivering
movies in an hour wasn't going to work. A

724
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:41,250
lot of people wanted online movies, and Netflix
was just beginning. Maybe Kozmo could have

725
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:49,060
competed with movies by mail, and then it
might have been able to move to delivery online.

726
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:58,640
Second, it seems that people who choose to
move late may be better suited to succeed.

727
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:05,190
Risk-takers like to move first, and they may
make their decisions too quickly. Entrepreneurs,

728
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:12,350
who want to avoid risk, watch the market and
wait for the right time. In research into

729
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:19,200
software companies, Elizabeth Pontikes and
William Barnett found that when entrepreneurs

730
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:25,190
waited for the market to cool down, they were
more likely to succeed.

731
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:32,190
Third, as well as avoiding some risk, settlers
can look at their competitors' products and

732
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:41,020
make their own products better. When you are
first, you have to make all the mistakes yourself.

733
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:45,700
Settlers can watch you and learn from your
mistakes.

734
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:53,610
Fourth, pioneers often stay with the first
products they sell. Settlers can watch how

735
01:22:53,610 --> 01:23:01,170
the market changes and change their products
so they remain right for the changing market.

736
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:08,150
Settlers can also wait for the market to be
ready for them. When Warby Parker started,

737
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:13,310
people had been selling products online for
ten years, even though the idea hadn't worked

738
01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:16,770
before for glasses.

739
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:24,040
The theory of pioneers and settlers is true
outside of the world of business as well.

740
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:31,540
In the 1840s, the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis
discovered that if medical students washed

741
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:39,260
their hands the number of women patients who
died giving birth was much lower. Other doctors

742
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:47,080
laughed at him. He became sick and died a
young man. Twenty years later, the research

743
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:52,810
of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch showed Semmelweis
to be right.

744
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:59,140
I don't want to say that it is never good
to be first. If we all wait for someone else

745
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:06,120
to move first, nothing original will ever
be created. Someone has to be the pioneer,

746
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:12,350
and sometimes they are successful. This is
often true when there is a patent behind the

747
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:19,870
product, or when a product becomes more valuable
as more people use it, such as social media.

748
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:27,290
But in most cases the chances of success are
not higher if you move first. And when the

749
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:35,740
market is not clear, or unknown, then being
a pioneer is a huge risk. The lesson here

750
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:42,181
is that, if you have an original idea, it's
a mistake to think you must move first, before

751
01:24:42,181 --> 01:24:49,190
your competitors. Procrastinating can make
it easier to achieve something, and, in the

752
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:58,560
same way, delaying market entry can give us
the chance to learn more and reduce risk.

753
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:04,620
But what happens if we take a wider view than
ideas and products? If we look at the whole

754
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:12,920
life of a person, is there a risk in waiting
too long?

755
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:16,460
Conceptual and experimental

756
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:23,620
It is widely believed that originality is
something we find in young people. Vinod Khosla

757
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:29,460
said at the National Association of Software
and Services Companies Product Conclave in

758
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:38,730
2011: "People under thirty-five are the people
who make change happen. People over forty-five

759
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:46,390
die in terms of new ideas." Albert Einstein
also said that a scientist had to make his

760
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:53,800
discoveries before the age of thirty. And
it is true that people do often lose their

761
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,770
originality over time.

762
01:25:56,770 --> 01:26:04,050
But this doesn't always happen. When companies
have suggestion boxes, it seems that older

763
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:10,350
employees have more and better ideas than
younger employees, with the highest-value

764
01:26:10,350 --> 01:26:18,510
ideas coming from employees over fifty-five.
And in new technology companies, the average

765
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:23,870
age of entrepreneurs is thirty-eight.

766
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:30,010
In art and science, David Galenson shows that
we're quick to remember the exciting young

767
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:38,290
people, but there are a lot of older people
who succeed much later. In film, for example,

768
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:45,210
Orson Welles made Citizen Kane when he was
twenty-five; Alfred Hitchcock made his three

769
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:52,790
greatest films when he was much older, at
ages fifty-nine (Vertigo), sixty (North by

770
01:26:52,790 --> 01:27:01,590
Northwest), and sixty-one (Psycho). Why are
some people creative early, while others start

771
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:05,510
to be creative later?

772
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:13,640
The creative age depends on the way we think.
When Galenson studied creativity, he discovered

773
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:22,570
two very different types of thinking: conceptual
and experimental. Conceptual people think

774
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:30,491
of a big idea and try to achieve it. Experimental
people work by trying different things, some

775
01:27:30,491 --> 01:27:37,240
of which succeed, while some don't. They are
thinking about a problem, but they don't think

776
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:44,010
about the answer to the problem when they
start work. They don't plan; they decide things

777
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:47,220
as they work.

778
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:53,650
Galenson believes conceptual thinkers move
quickly, while experimental thinkers take

779
01:27:53,650 --> 01:28:01,790
longer. He studied economists who had won
the Nobel Prize and discovered that on average

780
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:08,060
the conceptual economists had done their best
work at forty-three, while the experimental

781
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:16,250
economists had done theirs at sixty-one. A
study of physicists who had won the Nobel

782
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:23,220
Prize discovered that half of those under
thirty were conceptual, while 92 percent of

783
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:29,190
those over forty-five did experimental work.

784
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:35,590
Conceptual people can work quickly because
they don't need to do years of careful research.

785
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:41,150
They are also usually young, because young
people find it easier to approach a problem

786
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:50,900
in a new way. But as they get older they find
it more difficult, and they become less original.

787
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:58,000
This was Einstein's problem. His most important
discoveries were made in his head. They were

788
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:04,130
ideas that explained things that had been
discovered by experimental scientists. As

789
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:12,900
he got older, he found it more difficult to
work with some of the newer ideas in physics.

790
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:18,820
Conceptual people have ideas earlier, but
then they risk copying themselves and producing

791
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:27,060
very similar ideas. Being experimental takes
longer, but it means the scientist or artist

792
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:34,920
is able to discover new ideas. Mark Twain
published Adventures of Huckleberry Finn when

793
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:41,940
he was forty-nine, changing the story as he
wrote it. When he started, he didn't know

794
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:45,460
how it was going to end.

795
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:53,191
As we get older, it helps to be more experimental.
Leonardo da Vinci was experimental, taking

796
01:29:53,191 --> 01:30:00,360
years to finish his greatest paintings. Martin
Luther King, Jr., too, was experimental, giving

797
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:07,900
thousands of speeches and changing them as
he did so. Moving quickly is fine for the

798
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:15,940
young, and creativity can be both conceptual
and experimental. But slow and thoughtful

799
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:22,030
can often work better for the older person.

800
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:28,130
CHAPTER FIVE
How to build coalitions

801
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:33,920
Many people have forgotten her, but no one
did more for women's suffrage in America than

802
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:41,690
Lucy Stone. She was the first woman in America
to keep her own name after getting married.

803
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:48,940
She was the first woman in Massachusetts to
earn a college degree. She was the first American

804
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:55,610
lecturer in women's rights. She was one of
only a very few women who spoke in public

805
01:30:55,610 --> 01:31:02,550
at all. She started the country's leading
women's newspaper, the Woman's Journal, which

806
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:06,630
was published for fifty years.

807
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:13,710
In 1851, Stone organized a women's rights
meeting, but she wasn't persuaded to speak

808
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:20,880
until the last day. In her speech, she suggested
that women should ask the government for the

809
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:28,220
right to vote and to own houses and land.
Her speech became known for pushing the women's

810
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:35,510
rights movement forward. Her words were read
by John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor Mill

811
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:42,410
in England, who later published a famous letter
about women's rights.

812
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:50,050
After the speech, two other great women, Susan
B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, joined

813
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:56,950
Stone, and together they worked for women's
suffrage. But a long time before they reached

814
01:31:56,950 --> 01:32:07,260
their goal the three women broke apart. In
1869, Anthony and Stanton left Stone's organization

815
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:14,840
and started their own. Working separately,
the two organizations had little success,

816
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:20,320
and the arguments between the three women
made many people think women weren't able

817
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:27,050
to be leaders. When Stanton and Anthony wrote
a book about the history of the women's rights

818
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:35,460
movement, Stone's name wasn't mentioned, if
all three leaders wanted the same thing, why

819
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:39,530
did they fight so bitterly?

820
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:45,530
This chapter looks at how originals build
coalitions to reach their goals and how to

821
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:53,100
solve the problems that can lead to coalitions
failing. Coalitions can do a lot, but they

822
01:32:53,100 --> 01:33:00,400
can also break apart easily because they depend
on people's relationships. We will look at

823
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:07,920
the difficulties of coalitions, at an entrepreneur's
battle to persuade people to try her idea,

824
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:15,460
at a Disney movie that almost didn't get made,
and at how Occupy Wall Street failed. You

825
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:23,320
will see how building good coalitions requires
a lot of work.

826
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:29,550
The important lesson is the "Goldilocks" theory
of coalitions, which looks at the ideas within

827
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:38,760
groups as too hot, too cold, or just right.
The originals who start a coalition are often

828
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:47,590
the most enthusiastic people in it, and sometimes
their ideas are too hot for others. It's sometimes

829
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:54,351
necessary to cool the message to encourage
other groups to join the coalition. The message

830
01:33:54,351 --> 01:34:05,110
needs to be neither too hot, nor too cold.
It needs to be just right.

831
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:08,190
Groups that break

832
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:14,410
We would expect that having similar goals
holds groups together, but very often, these

833
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:21,720
goals drive groups apart. Even though people
share the same goals, some groups push their

834
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:29,620
ideas further, and these groups are often
very critical of those who are less enthusiastic.

835
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:37,030
In one study, vegetarians (who don't eat meat)
and vegans (who don't eat meat or any other

836
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:45,150
animal products like milk or eggs) gave their
opinions about one another. Vegans disliked

837
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:53,640
vegetarians three times as much as vegetarians
disliked vegans. The vegans with the strongest

838
01:34:53,640 --> 01:35:01,020
opinions thought that vegetarians were weak:
if they really cared about animals, they wouldn't

839
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:08,650
eat animal products like eggs. The more strongly
you feel about something, the more you want

840
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:13,400
to show you are different from people who
have some of your goals but who don't push

841
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:17,470
their ideas as far as you do.

842
01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:24,260
This is why Anthony and Stanton broke away
from Lucy Stone. They wanted to push things

843
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:32,170
further. Things got really bad when Anthony
and Stanton argued against giving African-American

844
01:35:32,170 --> 01:35:38,920
men the vote. If women couldn't vote, they
said, these men shouldn't be able to vote

845
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:48,520
either. Stone did not agree; she wanted suffrage
for African Americans. Anthony and Stanton

846
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:55,170
were very angry; they thought Stone was not
serious about women's suffrage, and they started

847
01:35:55,170 --> 01:36:02,820
their own women's suffrage organization. Stone
tried to calm things down, but for twenty

848
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:09,520
years their two groups worked separately,
sometimes even against one another.

849
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:17,220
Now there were two separate groups, they needed
to find new people to help them and form new

850
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:26,070
coalitions. They all found help from an unexpected
group, the Women's Christian Temperance Union,

851
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:33,410
a women's group that was trying to stop people
drinking alcohol. Men who drank alcohol were

852
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:41,820
often violent with their wives, and their
families became poor. But the WCTU members

853
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:48,261
were very different from the women's suffrage
groups. They were often women from rich, usually

854
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:55,740
very religious, families who did not support
modern ideas. Yet the groups managed to work

855
01:36:55,740 --> 01:37:03,860
together. Many people across the country disliked
the idea of women's suffrage, and it's a surprise

856
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:11,050
that the WCTU was happy to work with groups
who were pushing for it. But they did make

857
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:18,900
progress, and, in several states, women achieved
the right to vote.

858
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:24,840
The following example of a young, creative
entrepreneur shows how business coalitions

859
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:30,220
can be built successfully.

860
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:31,220
Building and breaking coalitions

861
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:32,220
In 2011, a student called Meredith Perry realized
that there was a big problem with the world

862
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:33,220
of technology. She didn't need a wire to make
a phone call or connect to the internet. Everything

863
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:34,220
was wireless. Except for one thing. To use
her phone and her computer she still had to

864
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,220
connect them to the wall to charge them. She
wanted wireless electricity.

865
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:36,220
She thought about things that can send energy
through the air, like radio waves. But they

866
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,220
wouldn't work well for electricity. What about
ultrasound? You can't see ultrasound, and

867
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:38,220
it is silent. Could it be used to carry electrical
energy without wires?

868
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:39,220
Her physics teachers said it was impossible;
so did ultrasound engineers. A lot of important

869
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:40,220
people told her she was wasting her time.
Then she won an invention competition. But

870
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:41,220
as an entrepreneur on her own, with no money,
she needed help.

871
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:42,220
Three years later, I met Meredith Perry. She
had managed to get 750,000 dollars from investors,

872
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:43,220
and she had the first example of a wireless
charger. It could charge things faster than

873
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:44,220
a wire, and over longer distances, and it
would be in the stores in two years. By the

874
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:45,220
end of 2014, her company, uBeam, had eighteen
patents, and investors had given it 10 million

875
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:46,220
dollars. "Every single person that is now
working for the company didn't think it was

876
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:47,220
possible," she said.

877
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:48,220
Perry had had the same difficulty that all
originals have when they want to do something

878
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:49,220
different. Most people don't want to change
things. She had talked to a lot of experts,

879
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:50,220
and they all told her about the problems in
her math and her physics. In the end, she

880
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:51,220
realized there was a problem with her message.
She had been saying: "I'm trying to build

881
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:52,220
something that can send electricity through
the air." Instead, she said: "I'm looking

882
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:53,220
for someone to make a part for this new product.
Can you help?"

883
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:54,220
This worked. By breaking up the project into
parts, she found people who would design those

884
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:55,220
parts. Soon she had people working on the
project. She stopped talking about the most

885
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:56,220
exciting part of her idea, the wireless electricity,
because that shocked people. She had moved

886
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,220
her question from why, to how. Instead of
talking about why she wanted something, she

887
01:37:57,220 --> 01:37:58,220
talked about how she needed to get there.
By talking about smaller parts of the project,

888
01:37:58,220 --> 01:37:59,220
she found people who would work with her.
When she couldn't find engineers to make a

889
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:00,220
big jump, she found engineers who would take
a few small steps.

890
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:01,220
Although it's usually a good idea for creative
people to explain why they want to do something,

891
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:02,220
if their idea moves too far from what people
think is possible, it may just frighten them

892
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:03,220
away.

893
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:04,220
Coalitions often break up when one group is
more extreme than the other groups. Occupy

894
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:05,220
Wall Street started in 2011, to argue against
the unequal sharing of money across the United

895
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:06,220
States by the financial center of Wall Street
in New York. In 2011, most Americans supported

896
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:07,220
the coalition, but support started to fall
as some groups in the coalition became too

897
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:08,220
extreme. Srda Popovic has suggested that the
movement's mistake was to use the word "Occupy"

898
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:09,220
in their name, which was about people camping
in the streets outside of banks and financial

899
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:10,220
businesses. Although many people approved
of the general goals of the movement, they

900
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:11,220
didn't like the idea of "occupying" a place,
because it was too extreme.

901
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:12,220
In the women's suffrage movement, something
similar happened. Anthony and Stanton built

902
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:13,220
a coalition with George Francis Train in 1867.
Train was popular, but he was strongly against

903
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,220
giving African-American men the right to vote.
It was a dangerous coalition that didn't work.

904
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:15,220
The state of Kansas was close to approving
women's suffrage but failed. And African-American

905
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:16,220
men didn't get the right to vote in Kansas
either.

906
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:17,220
Later, Anthony and Stanton put together a
coalition with Victoria Woodhull, who was

907
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:18,220
a woman with very strong views and believed
that women should have the right to love who

908
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:19,220
they wanted, and, as she said, "to change
that love every day if I please." This was

909
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:20,220
too much for many people and frightened away
some of the supporters of women's suffrage.

910
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:21,220
Many people think that this delayed women's
suffrage for twenty years.

911
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:22,220
A recent study by Blake Ashforth and Peter
Reingen shows an interesting thing about coalitions.

912
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:23,220
For people inside a coalition, the most important
people are the people at the center of the

913
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:24,220
group. For the women's suffrage coalition,
this was Anthony and Stanton. But for people

914
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:25,220
outside of a coalition, the person they notice
is the one with the most extreme ideas. In

915
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:26,220
the women's suffrage coalition, that person
was Woodhull.

916
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:27,220
Enemies are better than frenemies

917
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:28,220
In The Godfather: Part II, Michael Corleone
says, "Keep your friends close, but your enemies

918
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:29,220
closer." But what do we do with people who
are neither our friends, nor our enemies?

919
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:30,220
Usually we see people as friends, enemies,
or as somewhere in between. Our closest friends

920
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:31,220
support us all the time; our enemies are always
working against us. But in fact there are

921
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:32,220
also people who we can call "frenemies." These
are people who sometimes support you and sometimes

922
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:33,220
work against you.

923
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:34,220
Michelle Duffy, a professor at the University
of Minnesota, did a study of police officers

924
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:35,220
and how they felt supported, or not, by the
officer that they worked with. Not surprisingly,

925
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:36,220
negative relationships led to stress. When
officers felt they weren't supported by the

926
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:37,220
officer they worked with, they didn't work
so hard and took more time off of work.

927
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:38,220
But what happened when the police officer
felt supported by the other officer for some

928
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:39,220
of the time? Things didn't get better; they
got worse. Negative relationships aren't good,

929
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:40,220
but at least you know what is going to happen,
and you can be ready for it. But when you

930
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:41,220
don't know whether someone will support you
or not, your stress increases. In another

931
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:42,220
study, Bert Uchino found that "frenemy" relationships
like this were unhealthier than bad relationships.

932
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,220
People with a lot of relationships that were
neither friends nor enemies had higher stress,

933
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:44,220
were unhappier, and found life more difficult
than other people.

934
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:45,220
We may feel it is better to keep away from
our enemies and to try to improve our relationship

935
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:46,220
with frenemies. But that is probably not the
best idea. It's better to keep away from frenemies

936
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:47,220
and try to turn enemies into friends. Very
often, the best supporters we have are people

937
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:48,220
who didn't support us in the past, but who
have now come over to our side.

938
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:49,220
First, when someone has always supported us,
we expect it and don't think it is that wonderful.

939
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:50,220
But, when someone who didn't support us starts
to become a friend, we like them even more.

940
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:51,220
Second, they will feel the same about us.
They've worked hard to beat their negative

941
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:52,220
feelings about us, and now they feel much
more positively toward us.

942
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:53,220
Third, and most important, our old enemies
are the best at persuading other people to

943
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,220
join our movement. They felt negatively about
our ideas before, so they understand the people

944
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:55,220
who still feel negatively. And they know why
they changed their minds, so they can explain

945
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:56,220
this to others. People will listen to them
because they know they weren't always our

946
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:57,220
friends.

947
01:38:57,220 --> 01:38:58,220
When Lucy Stone, who was working for both
women's suffrage and African-American suffrage,

948
01:38:58,220 --> 01:38:59,220
walked around towns putting up posters for
meetings, young men often followed her, pulling

949
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:00,220
the posters down. Stone asked them if they
loved their mothers. Of course. Did they love

950
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:01,220
their sisters? Certainly. She then explained
that in the south of the United States, African-

951
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:02,220
American men of their age were sold and would
never see their families again. She then invited

952
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:03,220
the young men to her meetings as her special
guests. Some of these men helped her, and

953
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:04,220
they were very useful when other young men
started to make trouble.

954
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:05,220
From unknown to known

955
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:06,220
In the 1990s, a group of writers suggested
something that had never been done at Disney.

956
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:07,220
Instead of the old stories like Cinderella
and Snow White, they wanted to write something

957
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:08,220
completely new. Nobody at Disney really thought
it was a good idea.

958
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:09,220
The story became The Lion Lang, the most successful
film of 1994, winning two Oscars and a Golden

959
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:10,220
Globe. Disney hoped the film would make 50
million dollars. By 2014, it had made more

960
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:11,220
than 1 billion dollars.

961
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:12,220
Early in the project, five of the writers
had a meeting with Disney management, where

962
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:13,220
they explained their story about lions. Michael
Eisner, Disney CEO (Chief Executive Officer),

963
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:14,220
tried to find something he could understand
in it. "Could you make this into Shakespeare's

964
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:15,220
King Lear?" he asked.

965
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:16,220
That wasn't really possible. But then, from
the back of the room, Maureen Donley said,

966
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:17,220
"No, this is Hamlet." Suddenly, everyone understood.
The uncle kills the father, and then the son

967
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:18,220
has to kill his uncle. So the film became
Hamlet with lions, and Disney decided to make

968
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,220
it.

969
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:20,220
Justin Berg, a professor at Stanford University,
has explained that the writers had to start

970
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,220
with the lions. If they had started with Hamlet,
the story would have been too much like Shakespeare's.

971
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:22,220
Beginning in a different place, with lions,
made the story more original, but it provided

972
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:23,220
other difficulties. With a completely original
story, people very easily get lost. After

973
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:24,220
starting with the original lions, the writers
found that Hamlet could help them a lot. For

974
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:25,220
example, they realized that they needed Simba
to think about his future, as Hamlet does

975
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:26,220
in his "to be or not to be" speech, so they
wrote a new conversation in the film, where

976
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:27,220
Rafiki tells Simba that he must remember where
he comes from.

977
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:28,220
Creating coalitions

978
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:29,220
Frances Willard became leader of the WCTU
after the group began working with the women's

979
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:30,220
suffrage groups. How could she link women's
suffrage to the problems of alcohol, which

980
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:31,220
were the WCTU's first interest?

981
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:32,220
Willard didn't talk about suffrage, but about
home protection. The idea of home protection

982
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:33,220
was central to many women, especially religious
women. Willard used religion a lot in her

983
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:34,220
speeches, and the WCTU supporters liked that.
But she also explained that women's suffrage

984
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:35,220
was the best way of protecting women from
men drinking alcohol and being violent.

985
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,220
To return to the Goldilocks idea again, the
idea of women having the right to vote was

986
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,220
"too hot" for some people. The idea of home
protection was "too cold" for others. But,

987
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:38,220
when women's leaders explained how women could
make things better for everybody, things were

988
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:39,220
neither too hot nor too cold, and soon women
achieved the right to vote in a number of

989
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:40,220
states.

990
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:41,220
After twenty years of fighting, the two women's
suffrage organizations wanted to work together

991
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:42,220
again. But it was very difficult for Stone
to work with Anthony; they had been fighting

992
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:43,220
for years, and the relationship was broken.
After three years, in 1890, Stone realized

993
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:44,220
it was impossible. She asked her daughter
and her daughter's husband to take on the

994
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:45,220
job, and the two organizations did come together.

995
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:46,220
When Lucy Stone was dying, in 1893, she whispered
to her daughter: "Make the world better."

996
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:47,220
It took another twenty-seven years before
women's suffrage was achieved in the United

997
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:48,220
States, in 1920, but Stone had done a lot
of the early work toward it.

998
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:49,220
CHAPTER SIX
How to be a rebel

999
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:50,220
A few seconds ago, he was standing calmly
on third base. Now his feet are dancing. He

1000
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:51,220
is ready to run to home base.

1001
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:52,220
He has been here before. He is one of the
greatest players ever to play baseball. Four

1002
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:53,220
times, he has led his team to the World Series,
and all four times, they have lost to the

1003
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:54,220
Yankees. Now his team is down 6 - 4 in the
eighth inning. Is it time to try to steal

1004
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:55,220
home?

1005
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:56,220
Stealing a base is one of the riskiest moves
in baseball. It increases your team's chances

1006
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:57,220
of scoring by only 3 percent, and to do it
successfully you have to slide into the base

1007
01:39:57,220 --> 01:39:58,220
at high speed, and there is a good chance
you will hurt yourself. Stealing home base

1008
01:39:58,220 --> 01:39:59,220
is even riskier than stealing other bases,
because the pitcher can see you and he has

1009
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:00,220
an easy throw. The pitcher has to throw the
ball 60 feet; you have to run 90 feet, so

1010
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:01,220
you have to run faster than the ball. And
your chances of getting hurt when you are

1011
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:02,220
running to home base are four times higher.
In the whole of the 2012 season, only three

1012
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:03,220
players tried to steal home.

1013
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:04,220
This man, though, is different. He has stolen
home base more than any other player of the

1014
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:05,220
day - nineteen times. In 100 years, only two
other players have managed more than nine.

1015
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:06,220
But if you think stealing base is about speed,
think again. He's thirty-six now, no longer

1016
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:07,220
a young man. He's been injured for part of
the season. Six years ago, he stole thirty-seven

1017
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:08,220
bases in a season, but he has stolen far fewer
in the last two seasons. His hair is silver,

1018
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:09,220
and he weighs more than he used to. This will
be his last season.

1019
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:10,220
But this man has spent his life taking action
when others stood and watched, and he's not

1020
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:11,220
going to stop now. He waits for the right
time and then runs. He slides into home base

1021
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:12,220
just in time.

1022
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:13,220
It's too little, too late. His team loses
the first game to the Yankees. But the effect

1023
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:14,220
on the team is enormous. They are on fire
for the rest of the season and go on to win.

1024
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:15,220
Years later, a journalist said that this man's
attempts to steal home base were the second-bravest

1025
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:16,220
thing he had ever done.

1026
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:17,220
The first was becoming Major League Baseball's
first black player, in 1947.

1027
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:18,220
To become original we need to take some risks.
We can never be sure that we will succeed.

1028
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:19,220
As journalist, Robert Quillen wrote in 1924,
"Progress always involves risk. You can't

1029
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:20,220
steal second and keep one foot on first base."

1030
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:21,220
From the start, Jackie Robinson had to deal
with white players who refused to play with

1031
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:22,220
or against him, as well as hate mail. What
made him so brave? We can begin to find the

1032
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:23,220
answer by looking at the families of players
who are good at stealing bases. Since 1962,

1033
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:24,220
only ten players have stolen at least seventy
bases in two different seasons. Do you see

1034
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:25,220
anything interesting here? Look at the table
on the next page.

1035
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:26,220
Trying to find out why some baseball players
steal more bases than other players, Frank

1036
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:27,220
Sulloway and Richard Zweigenhaft found more
than 400 men who played professional baseball.

1037
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:28,220
Then they found something surprising. Birth
order can tell you which man will try to steal

1038
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:29,220
most bases. Younger brothers were 10.6 times
more likely than older brothers to try to

1039
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:30,220
steal.

1040
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:31,220
Younger brothers weren't better players in
other ways. The big difference was in how

1041
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:32,220
often they took risks. And they didn't just
take more risks; they were 3.2 times more

1042
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,220
likely to steal a base safely.

1043
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:34,220
The desire to take risks actually means that
younger brothers are less likely to play baseball.

1044
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:35,220
Across twenty-four studies of more than 8,000
people, younger brothers and sisters were

1045
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:36,220
1.48 times more likely to choose sports where
there are more injuries, such as football,

1046
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:37,220
rugby, diving, skiing, and car racing. Older
brothers and sisters preferred safer sports:

1047
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:38,220
baseball, golf, tennis, rowing, and cycling.

1048
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:39,220
If we look at the three players who have stolen
the most bases, Jackie Robinson was the youngest

1049
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:40,220
of five children. Rod Carew, who comes second
in the number of steals, is fourth of five

1050
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:41,220
children. And third is Paul Molitor, who is
the fourth child of eight.

1051
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:42,220
Younger children are not just risk-takers
in baseball. There are differences in politics

1052
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:43,220
and science, too. Sulloway researched nearly
4,000 scientists to see what they had said

1053
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,220
when revolutionary ideas appeared. He looked
at the ideas of major scientists such as Copernicus,

1054
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:45,220
Darwin, Newton, and Einstein, and he researched
what 4,000 other scientists had written at

1055
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:46,220
the time. Had they supported these revolutionary
ideas or not?

1056
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:47,220
Compared to firstborn children, scientists
who were younger children were three times

1057
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:48,220
more likely to support Newton and Einstein
at the time when their theories were revolutionary.

1058
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:49,220
In the fifty years after Copernicus published
his idea that the earth went around the sun,

1059
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:50,220
scientists who were younger children were
5.4 times more likely to support Copernicus'

1060
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:51,220
ideas than firstborn scientists.

1061
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:52,220
We often expect that younger scientists are
more likely to support new ideas. But Sulloway

1062
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:53,220
shows that birth order is actually more important
than age.

1063
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:54,220
As a firstborn myself, I was a little upset
by this research. But, as I learned more,

1064
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,220
I realized that the effects of birth order
can be avoided. By bringing up all children

1065
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:56,220
in a similar way to younger children, we can
raise any child to be more original.

1066
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:57,220
This chapter looks at how the family affects
originality. What is special about being a

1067
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:58,220
younger child does family size matter, and
how can this affect the way we raise our children?

1068
01:40:58,220 --> 01:40:59,220
I'll use birth order as a way of looking at
the effect family has on how likely we are

1069
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:00,220
to take risks. To see how brothers and sisters
are more different than we expect, we'll look

1070
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:01,220
at how Jackie Robinson was raised, and also
at the early years of some of the greatest

1071
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:02,220
comedy stars in America. You'll also find
out how parents congratulate children in the

1072
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:03,220
wrong way and how reading stories can help
originality.

1073
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:04,220
Born to be a rebel

1074
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:05,220
One day in 1944, when he was still in the
army, Jackie Robinson refused to sit at the

1075
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:06,220
back of a bus with other African Americans.
The driver "shouted that if I didn't move

1076
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:07,220
to the (back) of the bus he would cause me
plenty of trouble," Robinson remembered. Robinson

1077
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:08,220
told the driver he couldn't care less about
the driver causing him trouble. When Robinson

1078
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:09,220
talked about his attempt to steal home base
in the World Series, he used similar language.

1079
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:10,220
"I just took off and did it. I really didn't
care whether I made it or not."

1080
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:11,220
"I really didn't care," tells us something
important about Jackie Robinson and what he

1081
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:12,220
had learned about risk. Many people, when
they are deciding what to do, think about

1082
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:13,220
how to get the best results. But someone like
Robinson thinks differently. What is the right

1083
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:14,220
thing for someone like me to do? These people
don't look at other people. They decide by

1084
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:15,220
looking at themselves. The first group of
people, who think about the results and what

1085
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:16,220
other people will think, can always find a
reason not to take a risk. And this sort of

1086
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:17,220
decision can be decided by birth order.

1087
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:18,220
For many years, experts have argued that it
is helpful to be firstborn. When he or she

1088
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:19,220
is born, the first child doesn't have to share
parents with brothers or sisters and gets

1089
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:20,220
a lot more of their parents' time. Firstborns
are more likely to win a Nobel Prize for science,

1090
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:21,220
or to get into the United States Congress.
Research into 1,500 CEOs shows that 43 percent

1091
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:22,220
of them were firstborn.

1092
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:23,220
In Europe, it was shown that firstborns earn
salaries that are 14 percent higher than their

1093
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:24,220
younger brothers and sisters when they start
work. But the situation changes by the time

1094
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:25,220
they reach the age of thirty. The salaries
of those born later grow faster because they

1095
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:26,220
are willing to change jobs sooner and more
often. Firstborns avoid risk more than those

1096
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:27,220
born after them. Those born later are more
likely to drink or smoke, and they are less

1097
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:28,220
likely to have good insurance.

1098
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:29,220
Although many people now think that birth
order has some effect, the science of birth

1099
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:30,220
order has many critics. Birth order doesn't
fix you in any way, it only affects the direction

1100
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:31,220
in which you will probably develop. There
are a lot of other things that can affect

1101
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:32,220
you. It's difficult for research to look at
birth order on its own; there are too many

1102
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:33,220
other things that can affect development.
But when I looked at birth order I discovered

1103
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:34,220
that it was a better way of deciding whether
a person would be a risk-taker than I had

1104
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:35,220
expected.

1105
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:36,220
In one study, people scored their brothers
and sisters and themselves on school achievement

1106
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:37,220
and on whether they were rebels or not. A
rebel is someone who doesn't accept the default.

1107
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:38,220
People with high school achievement were 2.3
times more likely to be born first than last.

1108
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:39,220
Rebels were twice as likely to be born last
than first. There are two possible ways to

1109
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:40,220
explain the risk-taking in those born later.
One is about how children deal with arguments

1110
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:41,220
with their brothers and sisters. The other
is about how parents raise younger children

1111
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,220
differently. Although we can't control birth
order, we can change some of its effects.

1112
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,220
Niche picking

1113
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:44,220
Look at a lot of brothers and sisters and
you will see the big differences in personality

1114
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:45,220
aren't between families, but between children
in families. As adults, brothers and sisters

1115
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:46,220
from the same family are different in how
much risk they want to take, or how much they

1116
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:47,220
rebel, even though they have been raised by
the same parents.

1117
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:48,220
Niche picking may help to explain this. The
idea was developed by Alfred Adler, who thought

1118
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:49,220
that Sigmund Freud's theories about parents
didn't explain the part that brothers and

1119
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:50,220
sisters play in the development of one another's
personality. Adler suggested that because

1120
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:51,220
firstborn children start life as only children
they learn from their parents. When second

1121
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:52,220
or third children come along, the first child
risks losing its first place, so may decide

1122
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:53,220
to take on the job of being a parent and give
orders to the younger child. The younger child

1123
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:54,220
answers this by becoming a rebel.

1124
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:55,220
It can be difficult to compete with an older
brother or sister, so the younger child has

1125
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:56,220
to choose a different path. The niche of the
responsible academic achiever is often taken

1126
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:57,220
by the first child. Once the first child has
taken this niche, it can be difficult for

1127
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:58,220
the next to compete. This depends on the age
difference; if it's only one year, the younger

1128
01:41:58,220 --> 01:41:59,220
child may be able to compete. And if it's
seven years, the niche may be open again.

1129
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:00,220
In baseball, brothers who were between two
and five years apart were more likely to play

1130
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:01,220
in different positions than brothers who were
less than two or more than five years apart.

1131
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:02,220
Jackie Robinson was a runner at college, but
he couldn't compete with his older brother

1132
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:03,220
Mack, who was five years older and won a silver
medal at the 1936 Olympic Games. Jackie Robinson

1133
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:04,220
changed to basketball, football, and then
baseball.

1134
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:05,220
Outside of the world of sports, I decided
to look at comedy. Comedy seems like a risky

1135
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:06,220
job, so we would expect younger children to
be more successful. I looked at a 2004 list

1136
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,220
of the 100 greatest comedy performers. You
would expect an equal number of any group

1137
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:08,220
of 100 to be born first, or born last. However,
when I looked at these 100 people, forty-four

1138
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:09,220
of them were born last, while only twenty
were born first. They came from families with

1139
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:10,220
an average of 3.5 children, but nearly half
were the baby of their families.

1140
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:11,220
When I looked at particular performers, I
found that their older brothers and sisters

1141
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:12,220
were often responsible achievers. For example,
Chelsea Handler's five older brothers and

1142
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:13,220
sisters are an engineer, a chef, an accountant,
a lawyer, and a nurse.

1143
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:14,220
Niche picking shows how younger children often
try to be different from their older brothers

1144
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:15,220
and sisters. Parents may try to give each
child the same experience, but birth order

1145
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:16,220
pushes their personalities in different directions.

1146
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:17,220
Less responsibility

1147
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:18,220
If Jackie Robinson had been a first child,
he would have been raised mainly by his mother.

1148
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:19,220
But, with five children to feed, Mrs. Robinson
needed to work. Robinson's older sister, Willa

1149
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:20,220
Mae, washed him, dressed him, and fed him.
And when she went to school, she took her

1150
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:21,220
baby brother with her, and he played outside
of the classroom. And, if he got into fights,

1151
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:22,220
his older brother Frank was there to defend
him. When older brothers and sisters behave

1152
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:23,220
like parents, there aren't as many rules or
punishments, and younger children take risks

1153
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,220
earlier.

1154
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:25,220
Parents often become more relaxed with the
younger children, and things are not so strict.

1155
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:26,220
And as the older children take on more responsibilities,
there is less need for the younger child to

1156
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:27,220
be responsible. The larger the family, the
more the younger children can escape responsibility.

1157
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:28,220
We can explain the risk-taking of many originals
by their position in the family and the fact

1158
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:29,220
that this gives them more freedom and allows
them to be rebels. But parents can encourage

1159
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:30,220
children to be original whether they are the
first or the last. But one of the dangers

1160
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:31,220
of originality is that being a rebel is not
always positive; it can also be negative.

1161
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:32,220
Some research into how parents deal with good
or bad behavior will be helpful here.

1162
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:33,220
Explaining and correcting

1163
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:34,220
Some years ago, researchers found that, between
the ages of two and ten, parents ask their

1164
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:35,220
children to change their behavior once every
six to nine minutes. This means perhaps fifty

1165
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:36,220
times a day, or more than 15,000 times a year.

1166
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:37,220
For their Altruistic Personality Study, Samuel
and Pearl Oliner studied people who had taken

1167
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:38,220
great risks to save Jews during the Holocaust
between 1940 and 1945, when 6 million Jews

1168
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:39,220
were murdered. They discovered there was a
difference in how parents had corrected the

1169
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:40,220
mistakes of those risk-takers when they were
children. Their parents explained why they

1170
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:41,220
were correcting them 21 percent of the time,
compared to 6 percent of the time for other

1171
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:42,220
parents. One interviewee said that her mother
"told me when I did something wrong... She

1172
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:43,220
tried to make me understand with my mind what
I'd done wrong." The Oliners also found that

1173
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:44,220
explaining was especially useful when it made
children think what would happen to other

1174
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:45,220
people as a result of their actions.

1175
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:46,220
This can also work with adults. In hospitals,
to encourage doctors and nurses to wash their

1176
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:47,220
hands more often, David Hofmann and I put
two different signs next to soap machines.

1177
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:48,220
Over the next two weeks, we counted the number
of times doctors and nurses washed their hands,

1178
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:49,220
before and after seeing a patient. The sign
on the left made no difference. But the sign

1179
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:50,220
on the right made a big difference: using
the word "patients" instead of "you" resulted

1180
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:51,220
in 10 percent more hand washing and 45 percent
more soap being used. Thinking about other

1181
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:52,220
people changed doctors and nurses behavior
more than thinking about themselves.

1182
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:53,220
Behavior and character

1183
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:54,220
Good behavior is encouraged partly by what
parents say after a child has done the right

1184
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:55,220
thing. The last time you saw a child doing
something good, you probably talked about

1185
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:56,220
what they had done. "That was so sweet." By
talking about their behavior, you encourage

1186
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:57,220
them to do it again. But Joan Grusec did an
interesting experiment about this. After some

1187
01:42:57,220 --> 01:42:58,220
children shared toys with other children,
some of them had their behavior mentioned

1188
01:42:58,220 --> 01:42:59,220
in feedback: "It was nice of you to share
those toys with other children. That was a

1189
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:00,220
nice and helpful thing to do." Others were
given feedback on their characters: "I guess

1190
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:01,220
you are the kind of person who likes to help
others. You are a helpful person."

1191
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:02,220
Later, in a similar situation, the children
who had received character comments were 45

1192
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:03,220
percent more likely to share toys, while those
who received behavior comments were only 10

1193
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,220
percent more likely to share. When our character
is mentioned, we begin to build up an idea

1194
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:05,220
of ourselves as a good person.

1195
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:06,220
It has been suggested that the message "Don't
drink and drive" might be better if it were

1196
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:07,220
changed to "Don't be a drunk driver." The
same idea can be used for originality. When

1197
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:08,220
a child produces a good painting, rather than
saying that their work is creative we could

1198
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:09,220
say, "You are creative." When we move from
talking about behavior to talking about character,

1199
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:10,220
people think differently.

1200
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:11,220
Why parents aren't the best role models

1201
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:12,220
We can give children quite a lot of freedom
if we explain how what they do affects other

1202
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:13,220
people. They will be more likely to be original
in a positive way, rather than a negative

1203
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:14,220
one. But, as they grow up, they often don't
aim high enough.

1204
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:15,220
Parents can begin the development of originality
in their children, but as children get older,

1205
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:16,220
they need role models people who have been
original in their own area of work. Jackie

1206
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:17,220
Robinson, for example, found a role model
in a young mechanic. As a boy, there was a

1207
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:18,220
danger that Robinson would become a member
of a criminal gang, but this mechanic explained

1208
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:19,220
to Robinson that he was hurting his mother.
Martin Luther King, Jr. had Gandhi as a role

1209
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:20,220
model, as did Nelson Mandela.

1210
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:21,220
Some originals have found role models in fiction.
For example, Sheryl Sandberg and Jeff Bezos

1211
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:22,220
have both mentioned finding a role model in
the book A Wrinkle in Time, in which a young

1212
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:23,220
girl learns to bend the laws of physics and
travel through time. There are studies that

1213
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:24,220
show that, when children's stories show original
achievements, people innovate more twenty

1214
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:25,220
to forty years later. In one study, psychologists
noted that original achievement increased

1215
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:26,220
in American children's books by 66 percent
between 1810 and 1850. Between 1850 and 1890,

1216
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:27,220
the number of patents increased by 700 percent.
Children's books reflected popular values

1217
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:28,220
at the time but also helped to create values.
It takes time for children to learn originality

1218
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:29,220
from characters in fiction. We can be sure
that the next group of originals will have

1219
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:30,220
been affected by Harry Potter, books where
there is a lot of original achievement. When

1220
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:31,220
children read about heroes who are also originals,
it may change the way they pick their niches

1221
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:32,220
in the family. Wherever we are in family birth
order, there are niches for us, and role models

1222
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,220
for originality.

1223
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:34,220
CHAPTER SEVEN
Groupthink

1224
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:35,220
Standing on stage in front of his audience,
a technology inventor pulled something out

1225
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:36,220
of his pocket. It was so much smaller than
competing products that nobody in the room

1226
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:37,220
could believe it. He was a man known for his
originality and creativity, and he didn't

1227
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:38,220
believe in market research. He said his company
makes products that people do not even know

1228
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:39,220
they want. This man made his company great,
only to be forced out, and then watch his

1229
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:40,220
company disappear.

1230
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:41,220
The story seems to describe Steve Jobs, but
actually, this man was one of Jobs' heroes:

1231
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:42,220
Edwin Land, the man behind Polaroid. Today,
Land is remembered for inventing the instant

1232
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:43,220
camera. But Land also invented something much
more important: the light filter that is used

1233
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:44,220
in billions of products, from sunglasses to
watches. Land was responsible for 535 patents,

1234
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:45,220
more than any American before him except for
Thomas Edison.

1235
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:46,220
Land was certainly a great original, but his
company did not encourage originality. Polaroid

1236
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:47,220
was one of the companies that started work
on the digital camera, but in the end, the

1237
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:48,220
company failed because of it. Polaroid's engineers
had a high-quality digital camera ready in

1238
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:49,220
1992, but the inventors couldn't persuade
the company to start selling it until 1996.

1239
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:50,220
By then, there were more than forty other
digital cameras on the market.

1240
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:51,220
Polaroid made a basic mistake. Within the
company, many people thought that customers

1241
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:52,220
would always want to have printed pictures,
and the important people in the organization

1242
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,220
didn't question this idea. It was a case of
groupthink - the desire to reach agreement

1243
01:43:53,220 --> 01:43:54,220
instead of allowing disagreement. Groupthink
is the enemy of originality.

1244
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:55,220
In a famous study, the psychologist Irving
Janis argued that many bad decisions made

1245
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:56,220
by the United States government were caused
by groupthink. Janis believed that groupthink

1246
01:43:56,220 --> 01:43:57,220
occurred when people felt they were deeply
involved in a group and they wanted to agree

1247
01:43:57,220 --> 01:43:58,220
with the group, instead of suggesting different
ideas. He said that it was the safe, friendly

1248
01:43:58,220 --> 01:43:59,220
feelings inside a close group that created
groupthink.

1249
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:00,220
People accepted Janis' theory for a long time,
but it isn't true. Janis did his work in 1973,

1250
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:01,220
but researchers now have seen a lot more government
documents, and it's clear that these bad decisions

1251
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:02,220
were not made by one small, close group. And
there was another problem with Janis' theory.

1252
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:03,220
Most of the time he looked at groups making
bad decisions. But how do we know that it

1253
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:04,220
was actually the closeness of the group that
caused the bad decisions? Janis needed to

1254
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:05,220
compare good and bad decisions to see whether
close groups are more likely to make decisions

1255
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:06,220
through groupthink.

1256
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:07,220
The theory of close groups causing groupthink
isn't true in business either. When researchers

1257
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:08,220
looked at successful and failed decisions
in management teams at seven major companies,

1258
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:09,220
they discovered that close groups weren't
more likely to want to agree with each other

1259
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:10,220
and refuse different ideas. In fact, close
groups often made better business decisions.

1260
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:11,220
The same was true in politics.

1261
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:12,220
In this chapter, I want to look at what really
causes groupthink and what we can do to prevent

1262
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:13,220
it. Why do some close groups make bad decisions
while others make good ones? I want to see

1263
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:14,220
how to fight groupthink and allow original
opinions. I'll look at Polaroid's mistakes,

1264
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:15,220
and I'll also examine an organization that
has an interesting new way of avoiding conformity.

1265
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:16,220
You'll see why people often don't listen to
original ideas, and why it's sometimes better

1266
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:17,220
to ask people to complain about problems rather
than to solve them. In the end, you'll see

1267
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:18,220
what ordinary people and organizations can
do to allow originality to develop.

1268
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:19,220
Commitment to organizations

1269
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:20,220
In the 1990s, a group of experts led by James
Baron interviewed 200 people who had started

1270
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:21,220
technology companies in Silicon Valley. They
asked these leaders what sort of organization

1271
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:22,220
they were trying to develop when they started
out.

1272
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:23,220
They found three major organizational plans:
professional, star, and commitment. In a professional

1273
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:24,220
organization, managers tried to hire people
with the right skills - engineers who could

1274
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:25,220
write in JavaScript or C++, for example. In
a star organization, managers were not so

1275
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:26,220
interested in skills as in the future; they
looked for the brightest people and didn't

1276
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:27,220
worry so much about their skills, because
these people would learn quickly.

1277
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:28,220
In a commitment organization, employees were
hired to fit company culture. Skills and intelligence

1278
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:29,220
were useful, but the important thing was that
the employee believed in the company. Commitment

1279
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:30,220
organizations wanted to build strong emotional
links between employees and to the organization.

1280
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:31,220
They often used words like family and love
when they talked about the company.

1281
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:32,220
Baron's team wanted to see which type of organization
led to the most success. They followed the

1282
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:33,220
200 companies through the 1990s, into the
2000s. They discovered that one organizational

1283
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:34,220
culture was much better than the others: commitment.

1284
01:44:34,220 --> 01:44:35,220
Where a company had a commitment culture,
the number of failures was zero. Not one of

1285
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:36,220
them went out of business. But the number
of failures for star organizations was high,

1286
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:37,220
and professional companies did even worse.

1287
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:38,220
We can see that a commitment culture worked
well in the early days of Polaroid when everybody

1288
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:39,220
worked hard and there was a desire for originality
and quality. When Edwin Land was developing

1289
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:40,220
his instant camera, he once worked for eighteen
days without stopping, not even changing his

1290
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:41,220
clothes. While his competitor, Kodak, hired
scientists, Land looked for a mixed group

1291
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:42,220
of employees, including women with artistic
experience. Just like the commitment organizations

1292
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:43,220
in Silicon Valley, he didn't worry about skills
or star qualities. He wanted people who would

1293
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:44,220
have original ideas and work hard for the
company. His employees developed strong emotional

1294
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:45,220
links with the company. When you feel like
that, it's hard to imagine working somewhere

1295
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:46,220
else.

1296
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:47,220
After the instant camera, Polaroid was responsible
for two other important new developments in

1297
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:48,220
film technology. The first was the use of
sepia, or brown, photos. Black-and-white instant

1298
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:49,220
photos often faded, and sepia worked better.
The person who discovered that was Meroe Morse,

1299
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:50,220
who had been a student of art history and
had not studied either physics or chemistry

1300
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:51,220
in college. She worked so hard that her laboratory
worked twenty-four hours a day. The second

1301
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:52,220
new product was instant color photography.
Howard Rogers, who had been a car mechanic,

1302
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:53,220
worked for fifteen years to solve that problem.

1303
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:54,220
Problems with growth

1304
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:55,220
Commitment cultures are very useful at the
beginning of the life of an organization,

1305
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:56,220
but, over time, things don't usually go so
well. Although these companies grow well at

1306
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:57,220
first, growth slows down after a time. When
employees share a commitment to the company's

1307
01:44:57,220 --> 01:44:58,220
clear goals, they can work well in a business
situation that they understand. But if things

1308
01:44:58,220 --> 01:44:59,220
keep changing, as they do in the computer
or airline industries, the positive things

1309
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:00,220
about this strong culture disappear. When
the market is changing, these companies find

1310
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:01,220
it difficult to look outside of themselves,
and they fail to learn and change.

1311
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:02,220
This is what happened with Polaroid. After
Land invented the instant camera in 1948,

1312
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:03,220
the company went from making under 7 million
dollars in 1950 to making 950 million dollars

1313
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:04,220
in 1976. During this time, there were no big
changes in the industry; customers loved high-quality

1314
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:05,220
cameras that printed instant pictures. But,
with the development of digital technology,

1315
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:06,220
the market began to change, and Polaroid's
culture didn't allow the company to move as

1316
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:07,220
fast as market developments.

1317
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:08,220
In 1980, Land was contacted by Akio Morita
of Sony who suggested that film was not the

1318
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:09,220
future and wanted Sony and Polaroid to work
together on an electronic camera. Land wasn't

1319
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:10,220
interested. He thought only about the chemistry
and physics in photography and didn't believe

1320
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,220
digital photos would ever be good enough.
As Polaroid began to have difficulties, Land

1321
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:12,220
didn't look outside of his organization. Instead,
he worked only with his supporters inside

1322
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:13,220
the company. He wanted to make an instant
movie camera, and he wouldn't listen to any

1323
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:14,220
critics. When it was ready, it wasn't a success.
It made only a few minutes of video, while

1324
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:15,220
competitors already had cameras that could
make several hours. The company lost 600 million

1325
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:16,220
dollars, and Land lost his job.

1326
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:17,220
Land was not alone in the way he behaved.
Research shows that the worse a company does,

1327
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:18,220
the more the bosses get advice only from the
people who agree with them. But this is the

1328
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:19,220
opposite of what they should do; different
opinions are useful even when they are wrong.

1329
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:20,220
The evidence suggests that it isn't social
links that create groupthink, but too much

1330
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:21,220
confidence. Polaroid had too much confidence
that customers would always want printed pictures,

1331
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:22,220
and they refused to look at other original
ideas. So how can you build a strong culture

1332
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:23,220
that welcomes disagreement?

1333
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:24,220
Think differently

1334
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:25,220
When I asked entrepreneurs and students about
the strongest culture they had ever met in

1335
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:26,220
an organization, the winner was Bridgewater
Associates. This company in Connecticut manages

1336
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:27,220
over 170 billion dollars for governments,
universities, and other organizations. The

1337
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:28,220
company culture is explained in a book of
200 key ideas. Although the company manages

1338
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:29,220
money, none of these ideas are about money.
They are about how to behave in any situation

1339
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:30,220
that you meet at work or outside.

1340
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:31,220
New employees are hired only if they fit in
with the company's ideas, and there is a camp

1341
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:32,220
where they study and discuss them. Although
there is a lot of discussion, Bridgewater

1342
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:33,220
is a close, friendly organization. Many employees
call it a family, and people often work there

1343
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:34,220
for a long time.

1344
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:35,220
Although Bridgewater has a strong commitment
culture in an industry that changes all the

1345
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:36,220
time, it has continued to be successful for
twenty years. Its secret is that it encourages

1346
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:37,220
original ideas.

1347
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:38,220
If you are an investor, you can only succeed
if you think differently from everyone else.

1348
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:39,220
Bridgewater avoids groupthink by inviting
different opinions from everyone in the company.

1349
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:40,220
When employees share independent ideas instead
of agreeing with everyone else, there is a

1350
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:41,220
much better chance that Bridgewater will make
decisions no one else has thought of. And

1351
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:42,220
then there is a better chance they will be
right when the rest of the market is wrong.

1352
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:43,220
I want to look now at the culture of the company,
which lies behind its brilliant decisions.

1353
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:44,220
Bridgewater's success begins with the man
who started the company, Ray Dalio. He's been

1354
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:45,220
called the Steve Jobs of investing, but employees
don't behave as though he is special. They

1355
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:46,220
are expected to be critical of him, and employee
comments are shared across the company. One

1356
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:47,220
of the 200 key ideas is: "No one has the right
to hold a critical opinion without speaking

1357
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:48,220
up about it." Dalio wants people who think
independently and believes that this will

1358
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:49,220
make the culture richer and stronger, and
better able to avoid groupthink.

1359
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:50,220
Finding complainers

1360
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:51,220
If you're a leader talking to your employees,
how would you complete this sentence?

1361
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:52,220
Don't bring me-; bring me-.

1362
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:53,220
I learned about this question from David Hofmann,
and I've presented it to thousands of groups

1363
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:54,220
of leaders. They always shout out the same
answer: "Don't bring me problems; bring me

1364
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:55,220
answers."

1365
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:56,220
This seems wise. We don't want people just
to complain; when they see something wrong,

1366
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:57,220
they should find a way to fix it. But when
it comes to groupthink this isn't always a

1367
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:58,220
good thing. Hofmann has done a lot of research
in this area, and he found that a culture

1368
01:45:58,220 --> 01:45:59,220
that looks mainly at solving problems doesn't
encourage people to investigate. If you are

1369
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:00,220
expected to always have an answer, you come
to meetings ready with your answers, and you

1370
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:01,220
don't get the chance to learn from others.

1371
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:02,220
To try to avoid this problem, Google has created
a team of "complainers" - engineers across

1372
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:03,220
the company who are well known for recognizing
problems and saying what they really think,

1373
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:04,220
even if it is negative. Before a major change,
managers often ask this team to give critical

1374
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:05,220
feedback. By talking to the complainers early,
the managers get the feedback, and the complainers

1375
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:06,220
often then become the key people to support
the change.

1376
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:07,220
Ray Dalio, at Bridgewater, doesn't expect
employees to bring him answers. One of the

1377
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:08,220
first things he did in the company was to
create a list of problems, which any employee

1378
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:09,220
could add to. Getting problems noted is half
the battle against groupthink; the other half

1379
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:10,220
is listening to the right ideas for solving
them. Bridgewater collects a group of people

1380
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:11,220
to look at the problems, share their ideas,
find out what has gone wrong and why, and

1381
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:12,220
suggest ways of solving the problems. It is
important that ideas are shared. As Karl Weick

1382
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:13,220
advises, "Argue like you're right and listen
like you're wrong."

1383
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:14,220
Critical feedback

1384
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:15,220
Even if an organization doesn't encourage
critical feedback from its employees, there

1385
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:16,220
may be ways of changing the culture. At Index
Group, the company CEO, Tom Gerrity, brought

1386
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:17,220
in an expert to tell him everything he did
wrong in front of his 100 employees. By showing,

1387
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:18,220
he was happy to get feedback, he found that
employees from across the company were more

1388
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:19,220
likely to challenge his ideas, and to challenge
one another.

1389
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:20,220
I've learned to do something similar in my
classroom. I collect feedback from students

1390
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:21,220
after the first month, asking for suggestions
for improvement. I then email all the feedback

1391
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:22,220
to the class. In the next class, I discuss
the suggestions, ask for more feedback, and

1392
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:23,220
suggest changes. Students often say that this
helps them to feel comfortable about becoming

1393
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:24,220
more involved in improving the class.

1394
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:25,220
It isn't just the open culture at Bridgewater
that makes it easier for employees to challenge

1395
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:26,220
managers. When they are new in the company,
employees are encouraged to question the company's

1396
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:27,220
key ideas. In most companies, the employee
is busy learning the job for the first few

1397
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:28,220
months and isn't encouraged to think about
any problems. But in fact those early days,

1398
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:29,220
when employees have more time, and before
they see the world in the company way, are

1399
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:30,220
a good time for them to think about improving
the culture.

1400
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:31,220
A few years ago, I was hired by Goldman Sachs
to help them attract and keep excellent employees

1401
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:32,220
by encouraging those employees to improve
their place of work. One thing we introduced

1402
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:33,220
was an entry interview. Managers have meetings
to ask new employees for ideas when they start,

1403
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,220
instead of waiting to ask employees what they
thought of the company when they leave. It's

1404
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:35,220
easier to start a relationship with the door
open than to try to push open a door that

1405
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:36,220
has already been closed.

1406
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:37,220
Movers and shapers

1407
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:38,220
Ray Dalio at Bridgewater is interested in
understanding people who shape the world and

1408
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:39,220
in finding out how they are similar. He's
interviewed many originals of our time and

1409
01:46:39,220 --> 01:46:40,220
has studied originals from history like Benjamin
Franklin and Albert Einstein. Of course, all

1410
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:41,220
of these people were enthusiastic and had
great imagination, but Dalio has three other

1411
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:42,220
qualities on his list of similarities. First,
"shapers" are independent thinkers and rebels

1412
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:43,220
who ask a lot of questions. Second, they are
honest critics and don't care who they are

1413
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:44,220
talking to. And third, they are not afraid
of risk; their fear of not succeeding is greater

1414
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:45,220
than their fear of failure. If Dalio doesn't
find a shaper to follow him, Bridgewater may

1415
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:46,220
go the same way as Polaroid. But Dalio knows
that preventing groupthink is about more than

1416
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:47,220
the ideas of one leader. The greatest shapers
don't stop at introducing originality into

1417
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:48,220
the world; they create cultures that encourage
originality in others.

1418
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:49,220
CHAPTER EIGHT
Working with emotions

1419
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:50,220
In 2007, a man called Lewis Pugh jumped into
the Arctic Sea. The ice was not completely

1420
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:51,220
frozen, and Pugh's plan was to be the first
person to survive a long-distance swim across

1421
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:52,220
the North Pole. Pugh had been in the British
Special Air Service before becoming the best

1422
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:53,220
cold-water swimmer on the planet. Two years
earlier, he had jumped off of the ice to swim

1423
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:54,220
a kilometer in Antarctica. But he doesn't
do it just to be the best in the world; he

1424
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:55,220
wants to make people think about climate change.

1425
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:56,220
Before he swims, something happens to Pugh
that has never been noticed in any other human;

1426
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:57,220
his body temperature goes up from 98.6F to
101F. When it is time to get into the freezing

1427
01:46:57,220 --> 01:46:58,220
water, his body prepares.

1428
01:46:58,220 --> 01:46:59,220
The passengers on the Titanic died in water
that was 41F. In Pugh's Antarctic swim, the

1429
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:00,220
water had been 32F. At the North Pole, it
was less than 29F. After falling into that

1430
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:01,220
water, a British explorer had lost fingers
in three minutes; Pugh's team estimated that

1431
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:02,220
his swim would take twenty minutes. But a
five-minute test swim at the North Pole went

1432
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:03,220
badly and, instead of imagining success, Pugh
began to imagine failure. If he failed, he

1433
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:04,220
would die. He became very afraid and questioned
whether he would survive. So would it have

1434
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:05,220
been better for him to imagine success?

1435
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:06,220
This chapter looks at the emotional cost of
going against the crowd. In my own research

1436
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:07,220
in a healthcare company, I tested how much
employees knew about how to manage emotions.

1437
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:08,220
Those who showed up well in the emotion test
also spoke up more with ideas and suggestions

1438
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:09,220
in the workplace, and their managers thought
they were better employees. They had the courage

1439
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:10,220
to challenge, but they were also able to control
their emotions when they were doing it.

1440
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:11,220
To understand these emotional skills, I'll
look at how Pugh got ready for the freezing

1441
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:12,220
water, and how Martin Luther King, Jr. prepared
civil rights workers to keep calm. I'll explore

1442
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:13,220
how one group managed to throw out a dictator,
and how a leader in technology persuaded engineers

1443
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:14,220
to make a major change to their product. By
studying how to manage emotions, you'll discover

1444
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:15,220
whether it's better to plan for success or
failure, whether calming yourself down can

1445
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:16,220
light fear, how to deal with your anger, and
what it takes to keep going when everything

1446
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:17,220
seems to be against you.

1447
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:18,220
Optimism and pessimism

1448
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:19,220
Although many originals seem to be confident
on the outside, inside they often worry and

1449
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:20,220
doubt their own abilities. When United States
government leaders described their most difficult

1450
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:21,220
decisions, they didn't talk about difficult
problems but about choices that needed courage.

1451
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:22,220
And research by Scott Sonenshein has shown
that people working for a better environment

1452
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:23,220
are often uncertain about whether they can
succeed. Challenging the present situation

1453
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:24,220
is often hard work, and there will be problems
and failures along the way.

1454
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:25,220
Psychologist Julie Norem studies two different
ways of managing these challenges: optimism

1455
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:26,220
and pessimism. Optimists expect that the best
will happen; they stay calm and expect to

1456
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:27,220
succeed. Pessimists expect the worst; they
worry, and they imagine all the things that

1457
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:28,220
can go wrong.

1458
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:29,220
Most people think it's better to be an optimist
than a pessimist. Yet Norem found that, although

1459
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:30,220
pessimists worry more and are less confident,
they do their jobs as well as the optimists.

1460
01:47:30,220 --> 01:47:31,220
And Norem soon realized that pessimists did
well because of their pessimism.

1461
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:32,220
Norem explains that pessimism works as a way
of managing fear and worry. When pessimists

1462
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:33,220
start to doubt themselves, they don't allow
themselves to freeze with fear. They imagine

1463
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:34,220
an enormous failure to make them worry more,
and that gives them reasons to succeed. Once

1464
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:35,220
they have imagined everything that can go
wrong, they look at how to avoid those problems,

1465
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,220
and this makes them feel they can control
things. They worry most before they act, so

1466
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:37,220
when they start to move they are ready to
succeed. They are confident because they know

1467
01:47:37,220 --> 01:47:38,220
they have prepared as well as possible. If
they don't worry, then they relax and don't

1468
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:39,220
plan. It's important that pessimists don't
feel comfortable.

1469
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:40,220
Lewis Pugh was usually an optimist. He took
risks when other people would give up. But

1470
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:41,220
in the weeks before a major swim he was often
more of a pessimist. It was not the words

1471
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:42,220
of his own team that encouraged him, but the
words of people who doubted him. Two years

1472
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:43,220
earlier, before another freezing swim, an
expert had told him that it was impossible

1473
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:44,220
and that he would die.

1474
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:45,220
As Pugh stood shaking at the North Pole, his
pessimism told him that things were not going

1475
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:46,220
to go well. But, instead of trying to find
reasons to be happier, he started to think

1476
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:47,220
about every possible risk. He made plans to
be sure that he spent very little time on

1477
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:48,220
the ice before the swim and to get to the
boat as quickly as possible afterward. "The

1478
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:49,220
trick is to make fear your friend," he says
on his website (www.lewispugh.com). But this

1479
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:50,220
isn't enough. Pessimism can be helpful when
you're sure about what you want to do. But,

1480
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:51,220
when you're not so sure, doubt can get in
the way.

1481
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:52,220
Keep believing

1482
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:53,220
When most people list the things that frighten
them, one thing comes up very often: speaking

1483
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:54,220
in public. If we want to understand how people
manage fear, we can just put them on stage.

1484
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:55,220
Alison Wood Brooks asked college students
to give a speech about why they would be good

1485
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:56,220
to work with. The speeches were filmed, and
a group of students was ready to watch them

1486
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,220
and score them. With only two minutes to prepare,
many of the students were actually shaking.

1487
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:58,220
If you were in this situation, how would you
manage your fear? When 300 professional workers

1488
01:47:58,220 --> 01:47:59,220
were asked, 90 percent suggested, "Try to
relax and calm down." But this is not the

1489
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:00,220
best advice.

1490
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:01,220
Before the college students gave their speeches,
Brooks asked them to say three words out loud.

1491
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:02,220
Half of them were asked to say, "I am calm."
The other half were asked to say, "I am excited."

1492
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:03,220
Changing one word was enough to change the
quality of the speeches. When students attached

1493
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:04,220
the label "excited" to their emotions, they
were scored as 17 percent better at persuading

1494
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:05,220
and 15 percent more confident than those students
who said they were "calm". The excited students

1495
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:06,220
also gave longer speeches than the calm students.
In another experiment, when students were

1496
01:48:06,220 --> 01:48:07,220
nervous before a math test they scored 22
percent better if they were told "Try to get

1497
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:08,220
excited" instead of "Try to remain calm."

1498
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:09,220
Brooks wanted to find out if it's better just
to accept worry, so she gave students another

1499
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:10,220
frightening task. They were asked to sing
in public, and they would be scored on the

1500
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:11,220
quality of their singing. This time, one group
wasn't asked to say anything before singing,

1501
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:12,220
another was asked to say "I am worried," and
a third "I am excited." The group who said

1502
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:13,220
nothing scored 69 percent; the group who said
"worried" scored only 53 percent. But the

1503
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:14,220
group who said "excited" scored 80 percent.

1504
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:15,220
When we are frightened, why is it better to
make ourselves excited than to try to stay

1505
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:16,220
calm? Fear is a strong emotion; when we are
frightened, our heart gets faster. If we then

1506
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:17,220
try to relax, it's like trying to stop a car
suddenly when it's going fast. It's better

1507
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:18,220
to take a strong emotion and turn it into
something different but equally strong.

1508
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:19,220
Author Susan Cain says that we have a stop
system and a go system. When we haven't decided

1509
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:20,220
what we are going to do, pessimism is dangerous.
Thinking too much about the dangers makes

1510
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:21,220
us worry and "stop." Being optimistic makes
us more likely to do something-to "go." However,

1511
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:22,220
in a situation where we have already decided
what we are going to do, and start to worry

1512
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:23,220
about it, it is better to be a pessimist and
turn our worries into positive emotions like

1513
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:24,220
excitement. This switches on our go system.

1514
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:25,220
In previous cold-water swims, Lewis Pugh was
certain he would succeed, so being a pessimist

1515
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:26,220
was helpful: looking at all the possible dangers
made him ready for anything. At the North

1516
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:27,220
Pole, this worked at first, but after the
five-minute test swim, which went badly, he

1517
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:28,220
started to worry: "What I felt on that stupid
test swim wasn't like anything I'd felt before.

1518
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:29,220
I don't believe I can do this."

1519
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:30,220
It was time to move away from pessimism. A
friend gave him three ideas to get excited.

1520
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:31,220
First, he reminded Pugh that twenty-nine people
from ten countries had helped him, and he

1521
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:32,220
put flags from those countries along the water.
Second, the friend told him to think of his

1522
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:33,220
parents and how they had helped him. And third,
he told him to think about climate change

1523
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:34,220
and how the swim might help. After listening
to his friend, Pugh was ready to do the swim.

1524
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:35,220
He jumped into the freezing water and Finished,
successfully, in eighteen minutes and fifty

1525
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:36,220
seconds.

1526
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:37,220
For Pugh, the most difficult thing was managing
his own emotions. But other originals have

1527
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:38,220
to manage other people's emotions. When others
are afraid to act, how can we encourage them?

1528
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:39,220
In 2009, fifteen young tourists visited Belgrade,
the capital of Serbia. After walking them

1529
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:40,220
around part of the city, their guide, a Serbian
in his thirties, talked about the country's

1530
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:41,220
recent history of high potato prices and free
concerts. But they weren't ordinary tourists,

1531
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:42,220
and they were getting impatient. They had
come to Belgrade to learn how to get rid of

1532
01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:43,220
their own country's dictator.

1533
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:44,220
They asked the guide how the people of Serbia
had removed the Serbian dictator Slobodan

1534
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:45,220
Milosevic. You don't need to take big risks,
the guide told them. You can do lots of little

1535
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:46,220
things - drive more slowly than usual, push
televisions through the streets, or turn lights

1536
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:47,220
on and off. The tourists just laughed. Small
things like that would never work for us,

1537
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:48,220
they said. If we did that, we would be arrested
and then disappear. How can we have a revolution

1538
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:49,220
when we can't meet in groups of more than
three?

1539
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:50,220
They didn't know it, but the guide had heard
all this before - from Georgians in 2003,

1540
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:51,220
from Ukrainians in 2004, from Lebanese in
2005, and from Maldivians in 2008. In each

1541
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:52,220
case, they had gone back to their countries
and removed a dictator. The guide, Srda Popovic,

1542
01:48:52,220 --> 01:48:53,220
had taught them all. He was one of the people
behind Otpor!, the non-violent organization

1543
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:54,220
of young people who had helped remove Milosevic.
Popovic had been attacked by the dictator's

1544
01:48:54,220 --> 01:48:55,220
police and had spent time in jail.

1545
01:48:55,220 --> 01:48:56,220
When psychologist Dan McAdams and his team
asked adults to tell them their life stories,

1546
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:57,220
and how they felt at different times, they
saw two patterns. Some people had mostly good

1547
01:48:57,220 --> 01:48:58,220
experiences and were fairly happy during most
of their lives. But people who had found original

1548
01:48:58,220 --> 01:48:59,220
ways of helping others often had stories that
started badly when they were young but got

1549
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:00,220
better later. Although they had more bad experiences
than the other group, these originals had

1550
01:49:00,220 --> 01:49:01,220
more happiness. They managed their problems,
and in the end, their lives were happier and

1551
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:02,220
fuller.

1552
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:03,220
After leading the group that removed their
dictator, Popovic began to help other groups

1553
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:04,220
that were trying to remove dictators without
violence. Not every group succeeded, but we

1554
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:05,220
can learn a lot from Popovic's way of managing
emotions.

1555
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:06,220
Using users to excite teams

1556
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:07,220
When Josh Silverman took over at Skype in
February 2008, the company had problems. Skype,

1557
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:08,220
a leader in free computer-to-computer calls,
was no longer growing as fast as before. Silverman

1558
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:09,220
decided he had to do something big. In April,
he announced that Skype 4.0 would appear before

1559
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:10,220
the end of the year, and it would include
full-screen video. Most employees were deeply

1560
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:11,220
negative about this. They thought there wasn't
enough time; the video quality would be poor;

1561
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:12,220
and users would hate using a full screen.

1562
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:13,220
Silverman didn't try to calm them down but
decided he needed to get them excited about

1563
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:14,220
video. He talked to employees about the big
idea: "It's not about making cheap phone calls.

1564
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:15,220
It's about being together when you're not
in the same room." Silverman talked about

1565
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:16,220
how Skype allowed his children to keep close
contact with their grandparents, who were

1566
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:17,220
thousands of miles away. Then he let other
Skype users talk about what Skype had done

1567
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:18,220
for them. A married couple talked about how
Skype kept them together when they had to

1568
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:19,220
spend a year living apart. A man in the army
talked about how he could be with his children

1569
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:20,220
even when he was in another country; they
even opened Christmas presents together.

1570
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:21,220
As they began to understand that Skype was
about connecting people, the team's worries

1571
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:22,220
turned to excitement. Their go system was
switched on. Skype 4.0 was ready on time with

1572
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:23,220
high-quality full-screen video calls. Soon,
Skype was adding 380,000 new users every day.

1573
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:24,220
Less than three years later, Microsoft bought
Skype for 8.5 billion dollars; the company

1574
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:25,220
had increased in value by 300 percent.

1575
01:49:25,220 --> 01:49:26,220
In Serbia, Popovic knew he had to show people
something to encourage them to act. People

1576
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:27,220
were too afraid to listen, so Popovic used
a picture of a fist to encourage people's

1577
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:28,220
go system.

1578
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:29,220
Strength in numbers

1579
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:30,220
If you are the only person with an idea, it
can be hard to defend it. But people can get

1580
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:31,220
strength from just a small number of people
who think like them. To feel that you're not

1581
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:32,220
alone, you don't need a whole crowd. Research
by Sigal Barsade and Hakan Ozcelik has shown

1582
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:33,220
that, in business or government, even having
one friend may be enough.

1583
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:34,220
If you want people to take risks, you have
to show them they aren't alone. This was the

1584
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:35,220
first part of Otpor!'s success. In 1998, they
painted a fist on buildings all around Belgrade,

1585
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:36,220
together with sentences like "I am against
the government because I love Serbia," "Bite

1586
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:37,220
the system," and "Argue until we win." Before
they saw the fist, people who were against

1587
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:38,220
Milosevic were afraid to say what they thought.
But, when they saw it, they realized there

1588
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:39,220
were others who were happy to take a risk.
Later, when police arrested members of Otpor!,

1589
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:40,220
those members were often asked who was their
leader. Popovic and his friends taught them

1590
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:41,220
to answer, "I am one of the 20,000 leaders
of Otpor!"

1591
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:42,220
Around the world, different organizations
have used small actions to show they are part

1592
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:43,220
of a larger group. In Chile, to complain about
the dictator Pinochet, people turned their

1593
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:44,220
lights on and off. When people saw their neighbors
doing that, they weren't afraid to do the

1594
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:45,220
same. Then people were invited to drive slowly.
Taxi drivers slowed down, and so did bus drivers.

1595
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:46,220
Soon people were walking slowly in the streets.
People understood there was no risk: it's

1596
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:47,220
not against the law to drive or walk slowly.

1597
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:48,220
In Poland, when people were unhappy about
government news on televisions, they knew

1598
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:49,220
that just turning off the television wasn't
enough. So they took their televisions outside

1599
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:50,220
and pushed them through the streets. It's
not against the law to push your television

1600
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:51,220
through the streets.

1601
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:52,220
In Serbia, Otpor! Found a clever way to change
people's fear to excitement: comedy. They

1602
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:53,220
sent birthday presents to Milosevic: a ticket
out of the country, and a prison uniform.

1603
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:54,220
It's hard to be afraid of speaking up against
a dictator when you are laughing at him.

1604
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:55,220
Laughter can work in other situations where
people are afraid, too. When you have no power,

1605
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:56,220
laughter is a powerful way to change strong
negative emotions into positive ones. After

1606
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:57,220
hearing Popovic's story, a group of students
wanted to do something about the very high

1607
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:58,220
cost of lessons at their university. They
decided to show the university president pictures

1608
01:49:58,220 --> 01:49:59,220
of their cheap and simple meals and invite
themselves to dinner at his house.

1609
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:00,220
But Popovic also has a message that isn't
funny at all. At first, Popovic seems to be

1610
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:01,220
an optimist. When others were ready to give
up, he thought there was a better future for

1611
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:02,220
Serbia. But when I asked him if he was ever
unsure, he told me he had doubts for all of

1612
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:03,220
those ten years. Even today, he worries about
the people who died, and he feels responsible.

1613
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:04,220
The importance of now

1614
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:05,220
On New Year's Eve in 2000, Popovic and his
friends organized a celebration in the main

1615
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:06,220
square in Belgrade, with music and dancing.
At midnight, the famous band the Red Hot Chili

1616
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:07,220
Peppers would appear, and everyone was very
excited. One minute before midnight, the square

1617
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:08,220
went dark and people began counting down.
But when it was midnight, no famous band appeared.

1618
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:09,220
Instead, a voice said, "We have nothing to
celebrate. This has been a year of war. But

1619
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:10,220
it doesn't have to be that way. Let's make
the coming year count. Because 2000 is the

1620
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:11,220
year."

1621
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:12,220
When John Kotter studied 100 companies that
were trying to make major changes, he discovered

1622
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:13,220
that the first mistake they made was to fail
to make people understand that acting quickly

1623
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:14,220
was important. Kotter noted that managers
didn't realize how difficult it was to persuade

1624
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:15,220
people that change needed to happen, and it
needed to happen now. If they don't understand

1625
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:16,220
the importance of speed, employees sit back
and refuse to change. Otpor! Made people in

1626
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:17,220
Serbia understand the importance of speed
when they announced: "This is the year."

1627
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:18,220
To understand this more, let's look at another
piece of research by Amos Tversky and Daniel

1628
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:19,220
Kahneman. Imagine you are the manager of a
car company. Sales are down, and you need

1629
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:20,220
to close three factories and lose 6,000 employees.
You can choose between two different plans.

1630
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:21,220
Plan A will save one of the three factories
and 2,000 jobs. Plan B has a one-third chance

1631
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:22,220
of saving all three factories and 6.000 jobs,
but a two-thirds chance of saving no factories

1632
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:23,220
and no jobs.

1633
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:24,220
Most people, 80 percent, prefer Plan A.

1634
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:25,220
But let's now look at the choice in a different
way.

1635
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:26,220
Plan A will lose two factories and 4,000 jobs.

1636
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:27,220
Plan B has a two-thirds chance of losing all
three factories and 6.000 jobs, but a one-third

1637
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:28,220
chance of losing no factories or jobs.

1638
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:29,220
These are the same choices as the first time,
but they don't feel like it. In this case,

1639
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:30,220
82 percent of people prefer Plan B.

1640
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:31,220
In the first case, the choices show what we
could gain. We prefer Plan A because it looks

1641
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:32,220
less risky. When we are sure we will gain
something, we want to keep and protect it.

1642
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:33,220
We want to save 2,000 jobs, rather than take
a risk and save no jobs. In the second case,

1643
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:34,220
we are told what we are going to lose. Now
we want to avoid losing anything, even if

1644
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:35,220
it means taking a bigger risk. We're going
to lose thousands of jobs anyway, so we decide

1645
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:36,220
to take a big risk and hope that we lose nothing.

1646
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:37,220
If we want people to change, is it better
to show them why it is helpful to change,

1647
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:38,220
or the costs of not changing? According to
Peter Salovey, it depends on whether people

1648
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:39,220
think the change is safe or risky. If they
think it is safe, it is better to talk about

1649
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:40,220
the good things that will happen if they do
it. They will want to act immediately and

1650
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:41,220
get there quickly. But if they think it's
risky, that doesn't work. They are comfortable

1651
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:42,220
where they are, so they don't see why they
should change. If we want them to change,

1652
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:43,220
we have to talk about the bad things that
will happen if they don't change. It's easier

1653
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:44,220
for people to take a risk when they know they
will definitely lose something if they don't.

1654
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:45,220
At Merck, the medicine company, they wanted
managers to be more involved in making changes.

1655
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:46,220
Managers were asked to think of ideas that
would put Merck out of business. They imagined

1656
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:47,220
that they were one of Merck's competitors
and developed ideas for new medicines that

1657
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:48,220
were better than Merck's, or looked at markets
Merck had missed. Then they had to find ways

1658
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:49,220
to defend the company against these competitors.

1659
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:50,220
This "kill the company" exercise is strong
because it asks people to think about what

1660
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:51,220
they might lose. Before, when managers thought
about new products, they didn't want to take

1661
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:52,220
risks. But when they thought about their competitors
they realized it was a risk not to innovate.

1662
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:53,220
Popovic realized that strong emotions were
needed to change the situation in Serbia.

1663
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:54,220
By stopping the concert and sending people
home on New Year's Eve, he was reminding them

1664
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:55,220
to act now.

1665
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:56,220
Deep and surface acting

1666
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:57,220
Anger is a good way to get people to do something.
We feel we have to fight when someone has

1667
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:58,220
done the wrong thing. But, although anger
can encourage people to speak and to act,

1668
01:50:58,220 --> 01:50:59,220
it can also make them do it the wrong way.
Debra Meyerson and Maureen Scully suggest

1669
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:00,220
that the key is to be hotheaded and cool-headed
at the same time. The heat pushes us toward

1670
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:01,220
action and change; the coolness gives the
action a useful shape.

1671
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:02,220
Arlie Hochschild has suggested that if you
are feeling a strong emotion like worry or

1672
01:51:02,220 --> 01:51:03,220
anger there are two ways to manage it: surface
acting and deep acting. Surface acting means

1673
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:04,220
changing your face, speech, and actions to
show you are calm. If you are working for

1674
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:05,220
an airline and an angry passenger starts to
shout at you on a plane, you may smile and

1675
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:06,220
try to show some warmth. You change on the
outside, but inside you haven't changed. You

1676
01:51:06,220 --> 01:51:07,220
are angry with the passenger, and the passenger
probably knows it. But if you are deep acting

1677
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:08,220
you might imagine that the passenger is under
stress, is afraid of flying, or has problems

1678
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:09,220
at home. You feel sorry for the passenger,
and your smile is warmer.

1679
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:10,220
Before Lewis Pugh starts out on one of his
swims, he uses deep acting. He listens to

1680
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:11,220
music and remembers jumping from a plane in
his army days. He is returning to the excitement

1681
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:12,220
that he felt then, and which he wants to find
again. Deep acting is a better way of managing

1682
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:13,220
emotions than surface acting. If we want to
show our emotions, we have to feel them.

1683
01:51:13,220 --> 01:51:14,220
The dangers of venting

1684
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:15,220
Less than a year after Rosa Parks refused
to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery,

1685
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:16,220
a United States court decided that separating
black and white people was against the law.

1686
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:17,220
Now that black people could sit anywhere on
a bus, Martin Luther King, Jr. and others

1687
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:18,220
realized they needed to help black people
reply to the violence that they might meet.

1688
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:19,220
The team put chairs in rows, like a bus, and
asked audience members to play "black" or

1689
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:20,220
"white" passengers. The "white" passengers
called the "black" passengers names, pushed

1690
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:21,220
them, and threw things at them. The "black"
passengers needed to act deeply. King wanted

1691
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:22,220
them to be angry enough to speak out, but
not to be so angry that they became violent.

1692
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:23,220
What would be the best way to manage their
anger? Many people suggest that venting works

1693
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:24,220
best, turning the anger against something
else like hitting a pillow, or screaming.

1694
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:25,220
But studies have shown that venting doesn't
help, even if you think it does or it makes

1695
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:26,220
you feel good. After venting, most people
are even angrier than before.

1696
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:27,220
When King and his team worked on anger, they
were careful to stop people venting. Sometimes

1697
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:28,220
a person playing a "black" man would get so
angry that he hit back. They would work with

1698
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:29,220
him so that what he said and did was less
violent.

1699
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:30,220
To use anger in a positive way, it is better
to avoid thinking too much about the person

1700
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:31,220
we are angry with. It is better to think about
the people who have been hurt by the person's

1701
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:32,220
actions. Martin Luther King, Jr. often did
this. He said he was not trying to beat the

1702
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:33,220
white man; he wanted to free black children.
Thinking about those who have been hurt can

1703
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:34,220
lead to a different kind of anger. Research
has shown that when we are angry with someone

1704
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:35,220
we want to hurt them. But when we are angry
for someone we want to make things better

1705
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:36,220
for them. We don't want to punish; we want
to help.

1706
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:37,220
When a voice told Serbians there was nothing
to celebrate on New Year's Eve, they felt

1707
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:38,220
an angry energy. Popovic said, "There was
an energy in the air that no rock band could

1708
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:39,220
ever recreate. Everybody felt that they had
something important to do." The next fall

1709
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:40,220
Milosevic lost the election, and the man who
told the people to go home became the president

1710
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:41,220
of Serbia four years later.

1711
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:42,220
E.B. White once wrote that he woke in the
morning unable to decide whether he wanted

1712
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:43,220
to improve the world or to enjoy the world.
He commented in an interview with The New

1713
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:44,220
York Times, "This makes it difficult to plan
the day."

1714
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:45,220
As we search for happiness, many of us choose
to enjoy the world as it is. Originals take

1715
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:46,220
a more difficult path, trying to make the
world what it could be. They may have to forget

1716
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:47,220
about their own happiness for a time. Becoming
original is not the easiest way to find happiness,

1717
01:51:47,220 --> 01:51:48,220
but the journey brings its own happiness.

1718
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:48,222
- THE END -
