CHAPTER ONE
The Bet

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:13,950
Professor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen's appearance
was as strange as his name. He was thin with

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,030
the thin shoulders of a student and his face
was extremely pale. His eyes were the eyes

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:26,580
of a man who studies little things. They were
always half-closed in concentration. Although

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,050
he wore thick glasses you could see that his
eyes were blue. But his strangest feature

6
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:40,310
was his abnormally large forehead, on top
of which sat a crown of yellow hair. Together

7
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,230
all these things gave him a bizarre, almost
grotesque personality.

8
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:53,190
Professor Van Dusen's family came from Germany.
Many of his ancestors had been famous scientists;

9
00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:00,600
he was the logical result, the mastermind.
And logic was his passion. He believed that

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:08,220
two and two always equal four, except in unusual
cases, when they may equal three or Five.

11
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,390
He believed that all things that start must
go somewhere, and he was able to concentrate

12
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,200
all the mental force of his ancestors to solve
any problem.

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,350
The public knew Van Dusen as The Thinking
Machine and perhaps this phrase described

14
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:30,750
him best of all. He spent all his time in
his small laboratory where he invented brilliant

15
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,280
theories that shocked scientists and had a
profound effect on the world.

16
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,490
The Thinking Machine didn't have many visitors.
When people did come to see him they were

17
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,880
usually scientists. Two of these men, Dr Charles
Ransome and Alfred Fielding visited him one

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,940
evening to discuss some theory (what it was
exactly is of no importance).

19
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,850
"That is impossible," said Dr Ransome.

20
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:04,270
"Nothing is impossible," said The Thinking
Machine. "The mind is master of all things.

21
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,860
When science understands this, it will be
a great day."

22
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,310
"What about the airship?" asked Dr Ransome.

23
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,670
"That's not impossible at all," said The Thinking
Machine. "It will be invented soon. I would

24
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,000
do it myself, but unfortunately I'm too busy."

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,940
Dr Ransome laughed.

26
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,940
"I've heard you say things like that before,"
he said. "But they mean nothing. The mind

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,950
may be master of the material world, but there
are some problems that cannot be solved by

28
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,110
thought alone."

29
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,840
"Give me an example," demanded The Thinking
Machine.

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,290
Dr Ransome thought for a moment as he smoked.

31
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:50,140
"Well, what about the walls of a prison?"
he replied. "No man can escape from a cell

32
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:56,810
just by thinking about it. If he could, there
would be no prisoners." He continued. "Let's

33
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:03,380
imagine a case. A cell for prisoners who are
condemned to death. These men will do anything

34
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:09,010
to try to escape. Imagine you were in that
cell. Could you escape?"

35
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,560
"Certainly," said The Thinking Machine.

36
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,820
"Of course," said Mr Fielding, "you could
destroy the cell with an explosive, but if

37
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,500
you are a prisoner inside the cell you can't
have that."

38
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,280
"I don't need an explosive," said The Thinking
Machine. "I would be just like any other prisoner

39
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,000
and I would still be able to leave the cell."

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,709
"You could escape only if you entered it with
tools," said Dr Ransome.

41
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,060
The Thinking Machine was visibly irritated.

42
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:44,340
"Lock me in any cell in any prison anywhere
at any time, wearing only normal clothes,

43
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,599
and I'll escape in a week," he declared. Dr
Ransome was interested. Mr. Fielding lit a

44
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,990
new cigar.

45
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:59,240
"You're saying that you could escape from
the cell just by thinking about it?" Ransome

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
asked.

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,250
"I could get out."

48
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,900
"Are you serious?"

49
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,790
"Certainly, I'm serious."

50
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,290
Dr Ransome and Mr Fielding were silent for
a long time.

51
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,710
"Would you like to try it?" asked Mr Fielding
finally.

52
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:19,769
"Certainly," said Professor Van Dusen and
added ironically, "I have done more ridiculous

53
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,559
things than that to convince men of less important
facts."

54
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:28,639
Of course it was an absurd thing but they
decided it at that moment.

55
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,210
"To begin now." said Dr Ransome.

56
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,509
"I'd prefer tomorrow," said The Thinking Machine,
"because..."

57
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:41,930
"No, now!" said Mr Fielding. "You will be
locked in a cell with no chance to communicate

58
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,589
with friends. You will receive exactly the
same attention as a real prisoner, a man condemned

59
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,590
to death. Do you still agree to do it?"

60
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:58,240
"All right. Now, if you want," said The Thinking
Machine, and he stood up. "The death-cell

61
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,800
in Chisholm Prison?"

62
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,840
"Fine."

63
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,110
"And what will you wear?"

64
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,479
"Very little," said The Thinking Machine.
"Shoes, long socks, trousers and a shirt."

65
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,849
"The guards will search you, of course."

66
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:16,099
"They must treat me like any other prisoner,"
said The Thinking Machine.

67
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:21,120
And so they made the arrangements. They had
to obtain permission for the experiment but

68
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,240
all three of them wore important men and everything
was finalized with a few telephone calls.

69
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,229
The prison governors could not understand
why Professor Van Dusen wanted to do it. But

70
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,949
one thing was certain. They had never had
such an important prisoner.

71
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,599
The Thinking Machine dressed himself in the
clothes that he was going to wear in prison,

72
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:42,949
and called his housekeeper.

73
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:49,949
"Martha," he said, "it is now twenty-seven
minutes past nine. I am going away. One week

74
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:55,580
from tonight at half-past nine, these gentlemen
and one or two others will have dinner with

75
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,969
me here. Remember Dr Ransome likes carrots."

76
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:07,050
A driver took the three men to Chisholm Prison.
The warden was waiting for them. He understood

77
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,649
only that Professor Van Dusen was going to
be his prisoner for one week. He was not a

78
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:16,599
criminal, but he must be treated just like
any other prisoner.

79
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:20,699
"Search him," said Dr Ransome.

80
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:26,719
The guards searched The Thinking Machine but
they didn't find anything. The pockets of

81
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:31,550
his trousers were empty and his shirt didn't
have any pockets. They took off his shoes

82
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,490
and socks and looked inside them. Nothing.

83
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:42,369
Dr Ransome regarded Van Dusen's weak body
and his colorless face. He was suddenly sorry

84
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:43,999
about his idea.

85
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:48,129
"Are you sure you want to do this?" he asked.

86
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:52,900
"Would you believe me if I didn't do it?"
The Thinking Machine replied.

87
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,900
"No."

88
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,960
"All right, I'll do it."

89
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,939
Ransome didn't like the arrogance in Van Dusen's
voice. His sympathy for the man disappeared.

90
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:09,270
He decided that the experiment was a good
thing. It would teach The Thinking Machine

91
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,270
a lesson.

92
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:17,039
"Will it be possible for him to communicate
with anyone outside the prison?" he asked.

93
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,249
"No. It will be absolutely impossible," said
the warden. "He will not have anything to

94
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:23,249
write with."

95
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:26,550
"And the guards, will they send messages for
him?"

96
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:32,189
"Not one word," said the warden. "They will
tell me anything he says and they will give

97
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:33,610
me anything he gives them."

98
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,569
"Good," said Mr Fielding.

99
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:45,459
"Of course if he does not escape in a week,"
said Dr Ransome, "and asks to leave, you will

100
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,459
let him go?"

101
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:50,099
"I understand," said the warden.

102
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,879
Then The Thinking Machine spoke.

103
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,150
"I have three requests," he said, "I would
like some toothpaste and also one five-dollar

104
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,020
and two ten- dollar bills"

105
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,459
"Could he bribe your guards for twenty-five
dollars?"

106
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,550
Not even for twenty-five hundred dollars."

107
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,189
"In that case, give him the money," said Mr
Fielding.

108
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:18,339
"And what is the third request?" asked Dr
Ransome.

109
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:22,449
"Could somebody clean my shoes?"

110
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:28,499
The three men looked very surprised. This
last request seemed completely absurd, but

111
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:34,490
they agreed to it anyway. After this, they
took The Thinking Machine to his cell. They

112
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,289
walked down a long corridor and stopped at
the third steel door.

113
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:46,720
"Here is Cell 13," said the warden. "This
is where condemned killers are kept. No one

114
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,100
can leave it without my permission. No one
in it can communicate with anyone outside.

115
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,730
It is very near my office and I can hear any
noise that comes from it."

116
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,290
"Is this cell all right, gentlemen?" asked
The Thinking Machine.

117
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,370
"Yes, it's perfect," replied Fielding and
Ransome together.

118
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,899
The guard opened the door and The Thinking
Machine walked into the dark room. No sooner

119
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:18,250
was he inside than the warden closed the door
and locked it with a double lock. Ransome

120
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,459
heard a noise from inside the cell.

121
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,069
"What is that noise?" he asked through the
bars.

122
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:28,720
"Rats - the cell is full of rats," replied
The Thinking Machine.

123
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,250
The three men said goodnight and were turning
to go when The Thinking Machine called:

124
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,020
"What time is it exactly, warden?"

125
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,120
"Seventeen minutes past eleven."

126
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,019
"Thanks. I will see you all in your office
at half-past eight one week from this evening,"

127
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,290
said The Thinking Machine.

128
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,550
"And if you do not?"

129
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:54,350
"There is no possibility of that."

130
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,709
CHAPTER TWO
Chisholm Prison

131
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:04,910
Chisholm prison was a large building. It was
four floors high and stood in the centre of

132
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:12,810
a large open space. The wall around it was
six metres high and impossible to climb. Even

133
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,459
if a man managed to escape from his cell,
he could not pass over the wall.

134
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:24,579
The yard around the building was eight metres
wide on all sides. This was the distance from

135
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:31,819
the prison building to the wall. During the
day, prisoners used the yard to do exercises.

136
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:37,439
But it was not for those prisoners in Cell
13.

137
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,970
There were always four armed guards in the
yard, one for each side of the building.

138
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:49,160
At night strong lights illuminated the yard
and the wall. The wires that carried electricity

139
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,860
to these lights ran up the walls of the building.

140
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:59,779
The Thinking Machine saw and understood all
these things. He had to stand on his bed to

141
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:06,759
see out of the small barred window. It was
the morning after his incarceration. He soon

142
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:12,120
realised that somewhere on the other side
of the wall there was a river because he could

143
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,949
hear the sound of a boat and saw a river bird
in the sky. From the same direction he heard

144
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:23,590
the sound of children playing baseball, so
he knew that there was a children's playground

145
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:29,390
between the prison wall and the river.

146
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:35,569
No man had ever escaped from Chisholm Prison
and it was easy to see why. The walls of the

147
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:42,029
cell were perfectly solid and the bars on
the window were new. And in any case the window

148
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:45,730
itself was too small to escape through.

149
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,970
But this didn't discourage The Thinking Machine.
He looked up at the light and saw how the

150
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:56,680
wire went from it to the wall of the prison
building. He realised that the wire passed

151
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,070
near the window of his cell. That could be
useful.

152
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:08,490
Cell 13 was on the same floor as the prison
offices. The Thinking Machine couldn't see

153
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,949
the ground through the window of his cell.
However, there were only four steps up to

154
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:19,470
the office floor. Therefore the cell must
be near the ground. Good.

155
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:27,079
The Thinking Machine remembered how he had
come to the cell. First there was the outside

156
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,689
guard's room which formed part of the wall,
next to the prison gates. There was always

157
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:36,589
one guard at these gates who let people come
into the prison and then let them out again

158
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:42,499
when the warden told him to. The warden's
office was in the prison building. From the

159
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:48,579
yard you had to pass through a solid steel
door to get to it. The door had only one small

160
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:54,410
hole in it to see who was there. Then between
the office and Cell 13 there was a heavy wooden

161
00:12:54,410 --> 00:13:00,129
door and two steel doors in the corridors
of the prison. Then, of course, there was

162
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,160
the door of Cell 13.

163
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,430
"There are seven doors between Cell 13 and
freedom," thought The Thinking Machine. "It

164
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:15,379
will not be easy. But there are advantages.
I am alone here. Nobody looks at what I am

165
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,379
doing.

166
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,639
There is one guard who brings my food three
times a day, at six o'clock in the morning,

167
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,209
at noon, then again at six in the afternoon.

168
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:31,449
And then there is the inspection at nine o'clock.
But that is all."

169
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:37,319
There was nothing, absolutely nothing in his
cell except a bed that was strongly made and

170
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:45,550
impossible to dismantle. There was no chair,
no table, no cup or fork or spoon. Nothing.

171
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:51,130
The guard watched him while he ate and took
away his plate and spoon as soon as he had

172
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,220
finished.

173
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:58,310
The Thinking Machine considered all these
facts very carefully. Then he began an examination

174
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:04,830
of his cell. He examined the stones in the
walls and roof and the cement between them.

175
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:11,519
He walked over the floor many times but it
was solid cement. After the examination he

176
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:20,649
sat on his bed and thought for a long time.
Because Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen

177
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:23,480
had something to think about.

178
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,930
Suddenly, he was disturbed by a rat which
ran across his foot and disappeared into a

179
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:37,350
dark corner of the cell. The Thinking Machine
looked hard into the corner. After some time

180
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:43,449
he saw several pairs of yellow eyes looking
back at him.

181
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,740
Then for the first time The Thinking Machine
noticed the bottom of his cell door. There

182
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:55,860
was a space of about five centimeters between
the steel bar and the floor. The Thinking

183
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:01,060
Machine walked into the corner where the rats
were, but he continued to look at the door.

184
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,569
The rats were afraid and tried to escape.
There was the sound of running feet and several

185
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:10,589
squeaks and then silence.

186
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:18,199
None of the rats had gone out the door, yet
the cell was now empty. Therefore there must

187
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:25,129
be another way out of the cell, even if it
was very small. He got down on his hands and

188
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:31,230
knees and began to look for the opening. Finally
he found it. It was a small circular hole

189
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:39,329
in the floor about four centimeters in diameter.
"So this is how the rats escaped. Interesting."

190
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:44,499
He put his hand in the hole. It seemed to
be an old drainpipe.

191
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:51,270
The Thinking Machine sat on the bed and thought
for an hour. Then he looked once more outside

192
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:57,279
his cell window. One of the outside guards
stood directly opposite, beside the wall.

193
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,779
He was looking at the window of Cell 13 when
The Thinking Machine's large head appeared.

194
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:06,779
But the Professor didn't see the guard.

195
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:13,769
At twelve o'clock the Cell 13 guard brought
The Thinking Machine his food. It was horrible

196
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:19,069
but The Thinking Machine didn't mind. He wasn't
interested in food. He spoke to the guard,

197
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:21,149
who watched him as he ate.

198
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:27,089
"Have they made any modifications here in
the last few years?" asked The Thinking Machine.

199
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:31,910
"Not really," said the guard. "They built
the new wall four years ago."

200
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,769
"Have they done anything to the prison building?"

201
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:39,769
"Well, they painted the outside. And then
seven years ago they had a new plumbing system

202
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:40,769
installed."

203
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:44,589
"Ah, I see," said the prisoner. "How far is
the river over there?"

204
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:50,600
"About a hundred metres. The boys have a baseball
ground between the wall and the river."

205
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,820
The Thinking Machine had nothing more to say,
but when the guard was ready to go he asked

206
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,860
for some water.

207
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,189
"I get very thirsty here," he explained. "Could
I have some water in a cup please?"

208
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:07,610
"I'll ask the warden," replied the guard,
and he went away.

209
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,500
Half an hour later he returned with a small
cup.

210
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,280
"The warden says you may keep this cup," he
told the prisoner. "But you must show it to

211
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,660
me when I ask for it. If you break it, I won't
give you another one."

212
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,360
"Thank you," said The Thinking Machine. "I
won't break it."

213
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,850
Two hours later the same guard was passing
the door of Cell 13. He heard a noise and

214
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:37,600
stopped. The Thinking Machine was on his hands
and knees in a corner of the cell. There was

215
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,159
the sound of several squeaks. The guard watched
him.

216
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:44,390
"Ah, I've got you," he heard the prisoner
say.

217
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,410
"What have you got?" said the guard.

218
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:53,409
"One of these rats," he replied. "See?" The
guard saw a rat in The Thinking Machine's

219
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:59,309
hands. The prisoner carried it towards the
light. "It's a water rat," he said.

220
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:04,370
"Haven't you got anything better to do than
catch rats?" asked the guard.

221
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,860
"It's terrible that there are rats in this
prison," said The Thinking Machine. "Take

222
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,350
this one away and kill it. There are many
more where it came from."

223
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:18,610
The guard took the rat and killed it. Later
he told the warden about the incident, but

224
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,750
the warden only smiled.

225
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,890
Later that afternoon the armed guard in the
yard outside Cell 13 saw the prisoner look

226
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:32,760
out and put a hand through the bars of the
window. Something white fell slowly to the

227
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:42,039
ground. It was a roll of linen from a shirt,
and wrapped around it was a five-dollar bill.

228
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,929
The guard looked up at the window again but
the face was no longer there.

229
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:52,630
With a smile he took the cloth and the five-dollar
bill to the warden's office. There was something

230
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:58,080
written on the outside of the cloth in strange
ink. It said:

231
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,630
"Please deliver to Dr Charles Ransome."

232
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:07,240
"Ha!" said the warden, "His first plan of
escape has failed. But why did he address

233
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,730
it to Dr Ransome?"

234
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:14,690
"And where did he get the pen and ink to write
with?" added the guard.

235
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:20,500
The warden looked at the guard and the guard
looked at the warden. There was no easy solution

236
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,380
to the mystery. The warden studied the writing
carefully.

237
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:31,080
"Well, let's see what he wanted to say to
Dr Ransome," he said. He unrolled the second

238
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,870
piece of linen.

239
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:41,080
"Well, if that - what - what do you think
of that?" he asked, extremely confused.

240
00:19:41,080 --> 00:20:15,899
The guard took the piece of linen 

241
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:19,450
and read:

242
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:51,220
"Epa cseot d'net niiy awe htto n'si sih. T."

243
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:58,149
CHAPTER THREE
A Message from Cell 13

244
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:03,990
The warden spent an hour trying to discover
what the message was. Why did his prisoner

245
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:10,780
want to talk to Dr Ransome? And where had
he got the materials to write? He examined

246
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:18,091
the linen again. It was a part of a white
shirt. But what had he written with? The warden

247
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:24,750
knew that the prisoner didn't have a pen or
a pencil. So what had he used? The warden

248
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:30,850
decided to investigate. The Thinking Machine
was his prisoner. "If this man is trying to

249
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:36,779
escape by sending coded messages," he thought,
"I will stop him."

250
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:43,169
The warden returned to Cell 13. He found The
Thinking Machine on his hands and knees. He

251
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:48,730
was catching rats. The prisoner heard the
warden and turned to him quickly.

252
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,290
"It's terrible," he said. "These rats. There
are hundreds of them."

253
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:59,130
"Other men can live with them," said the warden.
"Give me your shirt. Here is another one."

254
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,760
"Why?" demanded The Thinking Machine.

255
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,159
"You have attempted to communicate with Dr
Ransome," said the warden, angrily. "As the

256
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:13,110
warden of this prison, I must stop you." The
Thinking Machine was silent for a moment.

257
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:18,850
"All right," he said, finally. "Here. Take
it."

258
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,919
The warden smiled. The prisoner stood up and
took off his shirt. He gave it to the warden.

259
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:31,480
In exchange, the warden gave him a blue prison
shirt. The warden looked at The Thinking Machine's

260
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:38,059
white shirt. He compared the pieces of linen
he had with the shirt. It was torn in two

261
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:41,429
places. The Thinking Machine watched him.

262
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:44,549
"Did the guard give you those?" he asked.

263
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:51,280
"Yes, he did," said the warden. "And that
is the end of your first attempt to escape."

264
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,640
The Thinking Machine watched the warden as
he looked at the shirt. He saw that there

265
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,409
were only two pieces missing from it. He smiled.

266
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:04,320
"What did you write this message with?" asked
the warden.

267
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,409
"I'm afraid you must discover that!" The Thinking
Machine said.

268
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:15,850
The warden became angry but he didn't say
anything more. He made a very careful inspection

269
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:22,049
of the cell and the prisoner, but he found
nothing. Nothing that The Thinking Machine

270
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:29,210
could use as a pen. And the liquid that he
had used to write the message was also a mystery.

271
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:34,080
Finally the warden went out of the cell. He
took The Thinking Machine's shirt with him.

272
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,830
"Well, he won't escape by writing messages
on a shirt," the warden thought.

273
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,980
On the third day of his incarceration The
Thinking Machine tried to bribe the guard

274
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,990
so that he could escape. The guard brought
his food and waited outside the cell door.

275
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:57,700
"The drainpipes of the prison go to the river,
don't they?" The Thinking Machine asked.

276
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,419
"Yes," said the guard.

277
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,850
"I imagine they are very small?"

278
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,630
"Yes. They are too small to escape through."

279
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:12,730
There was silence. The Thinking Machine finished
his food. Then he said:

280
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,299
"You know I'm not a criminal, don't you?"

281
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:17,299
"Yes."

282
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:20,330
"And I can leave the prison if I want to?"

283
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,330
"Yes."

284
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:26,899
"Well, when I came here I believed I could
escape," said the prisoner. "Will you help

285
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,450
me if I give you some money?"

286
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,660
The guard was an honest man.

287
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,659
"No," he said.

288
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:38,639
"Five hundred dollars," said The Thinking
Machine. "I am not a criminal."

289
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:41,630
"No," said the guard.

290
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,429
"A thousand?"

291
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:49,360
"No. If you gave me ten thousand dollars,
I couldn't get you out. To get out you have

292
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,399
to pass through seven doors and I only have
the keys to two."

293
00:24:53,399 --> 00:25:00,340
The guard ran to the warden's office and told
him about the prisoner's offer.

294
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:07,090
"Plan number two fails," said the warden and
smiled. "First a message and then a bribe."

295
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:14,570
At six o'clock, the guard went to Cell 13
again to bring food to The Thinking Machine.

296
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:20,880
He stopped in the corridor. There was a noise
coming from inside the cell. The guard walked

297
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:28,019
very quietly to the cell door. Through the
bars he saw The Thinking Machine at the window.

298
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:32,860
He was trying to cut through the iron bars
of the window with a file.

299
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:38,519
The guard went back to the office and told
the warden. The two men went back to Cell

300
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:44,630
13, walking very quietly. The warden looked
into the cell and saw The Thinking Machine

301
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,650
still at the window. He entered the cell.

302
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:54,690
The Thinking Machine turned round and jumped
onto the floor. He tried to hide the file

303
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,760
in his hand.

304
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,960
"Give it to me," said the warden.

305
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,130
"No," said the prisoner. There was anger in
his voice.

306
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,149
"Come on. Give it to me."

307
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:05,600
"No," repeated The Thinking Machine.

308
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,910
"Very well. Search him," said the warden to
the guard.

309
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:16,400
The guard searched The Thinking Machine. After
some minutes he found a piece of steel about

310
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:23,050
five centimeters long in the prisoner's trousers.
A few minutes later he found another piece.

311
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:28,460
The guard gave the pieces of steel to the
warden. The warden looked at them.

312
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,750
"You couldn't cut through the bars on the
window with these," he said.

313
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,850
"Yes I could," said The Thinking Machine.

314
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:39,080
"In six months perhaps," said the warden,
smiling.

315
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,220
"Just wait, you'll see," said The Thinking
Machine.

316
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:50,149
Once more the guard searched the cell. But
once more they found nothing. The warden stood

317
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:55,370
on the bed and looked at the bars of the window.
He took the bars in his hand and tried to

318
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:01,560
move them. They were immovable. He smiled
and then got down from the bed.

319
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:07,500
"Forget it, Professor, you will never escape
from here," he said.

320
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,450
The Thinking Machine said nothing. He just
sat on the bed with his head in his hands.

321
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,600
The warden and the guard went out of the cell
and closed the door.

322
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:24,210
"He is mad to try and escape," said the warden,
"but he is very clever. I would like to know

323
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,429
what he used to write that coded message."

324
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:33,200
It was four o'clock the next morning when
a terrible scream resounded through the prison.

325
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,769
It came from a cell near the centre of the
building, a sound full of horror and great

326
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:44,250
fear. The warden heard it and ran with three
of his men into the long corridor that went

327
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,870
to Cell 13.

328
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,730
CHAPTER FOUR
A Strange Voice

329
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:58,210
As they ran they heard the scream again. The
white faces of prisoners appeared at cell

330
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,019
doors. They were afraid.

331
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:03,630
"It's that crazy man in Cell 13." the warden
said.

332
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:09,610
He stopped and looked into the cell. "That
crazy man in Cell 13" was sleeping comfortably

333
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:15,149
in his bed. They heard the scream again. It
was coming from somewhere above. The warden

334
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:21,970
and the guards went upstairs. There they found
a man in Cell 43, directly above Cell 13.

335
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,090
He was sitting in the corner of his cell like
a child.

336
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,580
"What's wrong?" demanded the warden.

337
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,400
"Thank God you've come!' said the prisoner.

338
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,520
"What is it?" demanded the warden again.

339
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,410
He opened the door and went into Cell 43.
The prisoner's face was white with terror.

340
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,539
"Take me out of this cell, please take me
out," he said.

341
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:45,850
"What is it?" asked the warden.

342
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,020
"I heard something - something."

343
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,009
"What did you hear?"

344
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:54,769
"I can't tell you," said the prisoner. "Please
take me out of this cell - put me anywhere

345
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:56,450
- but take me out of here."

346
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,980
"Who is this man?" the warden asked the guard.

347
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,850
"His name is Joseph Ballard," the guard replied.

348
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,009
"And what is his crime?"

349
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:08,880
"They say he killed a woman with acid."

350
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,380
"But they can't prove it," said the prisoner.
"They can't prove it!" The warden was silent

351
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,380
for a minute.

352
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:21,020
"Listen to me, Ballard," he said, finally.
"If you heard something, I want to know what

353
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,289
it was. Now tell me."

354
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:28,149
"I can't tell you." Ballard was crying now.
"Where did it come from?"

355
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:33,000
"I don't know. Everywhere - nowhere. I don't
know."

356
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,720
"Was it a voice?"

357
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,990
"I can't tell you," said the prisoner. "You
must tell me," said the warden, angrily.

358
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,309
"It was a voice - but - but - it wasn't human,"
said the prisoner.

359
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:50,190
"A voice, but not human?" repeated the warden.
He was confused.

360
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,970
"It was strange and very far away, like a
ghost."

361
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,529
"Did it come from inside or outside the prison?"

362
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:05,029
"It didn't come from anywhere. It was here,
there, everywhere. I heard it. I heard it!"

363
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:10,530
For an hour the warden tried to get the story,
but Ballard became silent and didn't say anything

364
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:17,039
more. Finally the warden went away. He was
very confused. Ballard sat at his cell door

365
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,390
until morning, his white face staring through
the bars.

366
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:28,179
It was the fourth day of The Thinking Machine's
incarceration. He stood at his cell window

367
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:33,909
and threw another piece of linen to the guard
outside. And once more the guard took it to

368
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:38,539
the warden. The warden read the message on
it. It said:

369
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:41,820
"Only three days more."

370
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,970
The warden was not surprised by the message.
He knew The Thinking Machine meant that there

371
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,170
were only three days more before he escaped.

372
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:55,649
"But how did he write it?" the warden thought.
"Where did he find another piece of linen?

373
00:30:55,649 --> 00:31:03,799
Where? How?" He looked at the linen. It was
white, like the material from a shirt. He

374
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:08,610
took The Thinking Machine's shirt and put
the two original pieces of linen on the torn

375
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:16,279
places. The third piece was completely superfluous.
But it was the same material. "Where did he

376
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:22,140
get it? And where - where does he get anything
to write with?"

377
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,440
Later on the fourth day The Thinking Machine
spoke to the guard outside his window.

378
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,049
"What day of the month is it?" he asked.

379
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:32,970
"The fifteenth."

380
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:39,070
The Thinking Machine made a mental astronomical
calculation. "Good," he thought. "Tonight

381
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:44,429
the moon will not rise before nine o'clock."
Then he asked another question.

382
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:47,450
"Who looks after the big lights on the roof?"

383
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,690
"An electrician from the company."

384
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,880
"You have no electricians in the building?"

385
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,940
"No."

386
00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:00,620
At the end of the afternoon, just before he
finished work, the outside guard saw The Thinking

387
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,100
Machine's head again at the window. He had
something in his hand which he threw to the

388
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,540
ground. It was a five-dollar bill.

389
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,250
"That's for you," said the prisoner.

390
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,820
Once again, the guard took it to the warden.

391
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,149
"He said it was for me."

392
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:23,669
"I imagine it's a present from him. I think
you can accept it," said the warden. Then

393
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:29,539
suddenly he stopped. "Wait a minute. When
the professor went into the cell he had one

394
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:35,500
five-dollar bill and two ten-dollar bills.
There was a five-dollar bill with the first

395
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:41,740
message. I have it here. But now he has given
you another five- dollar bill. It's impossible.

396
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,470
He has only two ten-dollar bills."

397
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:51,049
"Perhaps somebody changed a ten-dollar bill
for him," said the guard.

398
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:57,290
"Perhaps. But tonight we are going to search
Cell 13 again. We are going to search it as

399
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,879
no cell has ever been searched before."

400
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:06,539
So that night at three o'clock in the morning
the warden and his guards searched The Thinking

401
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:13,100
Machine's cell again. The warden found the
hole in the floor. He put his hand into it.

402
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:21,039
There was something there. He pulled it out.
A dead rat. He threw it to the floor in disgust.

403
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,019
But he continued the search. Once more he
examined the bars on the window but found

404
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:32,460
them to be solid. He then examined The Thinking
Machine's clothes. In his trousers he found

405
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,759
some money.

406
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,880
"Five one-dollar bills!" said the warden.
He was very surprised.

407
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,480
"That's right," said the prisoner.

408
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,890
"But the... you had two tens and a five...
how do you do it?"

409
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,080
"That's my business," said The Thinking Machine.

410
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,580
"Did any of my men change this money for you?"

411
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,580
"No."

412
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,779
"Well, do you make it?" asked the warden.

413
00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:00,919
"That's my business," said the prisoner again.

414
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:06,149
The warden was very angry. He left the cell
and went back to bed.

415
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:12,270
About an hour later he heard the scream again.
He got up and ran immediately to Cell 43,

416
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:16,660
where he saw Ballard, his face pressed against
the bars of the door.

417
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:23,850
"Take me out, take me out," he screamed. "I
did it. I did it. I killed her. Take me out

418
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,850
of here."

419
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,190
"Was it the voice again?" asked the warden.

420
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,560
"Yes," said Ballard.

421
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,300
"What did it say?"

422
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:38,670
"Acid - acid - acid!" said the prisoner. "It
knew. I threw the acid in the woman's face

423
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,190
and killed her. Oh!"

424
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:48,610
"Acid?" repeated the warden, more confused
than ever.

425
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:54,180
CHAPTER FIVE
Countdown to Freedom

426
00:34:54,180 --> 00:35:00,610
On the fifth day of The Thinking Machine's
incarceration, the warden looked tired. He

427
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:06,660
wanted this thing to finish. He wanted his
confusion to end. But that day The Thinking

428
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:14,191
Machine threw another piece of linen to the
guard. It said "Only two days more". This

429
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:19,020
time there was a silver half-dollar with it.

430
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:25,770
Now the warden knew - he knew that the man
in Cell 13 didn't have any half-dollars - he

431
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:31,350
couldn't have any half-dollars. Just as he
couldn't have pen and ink and linen. But he

432
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:39,530
did have them. It was a fact, not a theory.
And that is why the warden looked so tired.

433
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:45,820
Then there was the voice that Ballard had
heard. The word acid. It didn't mean anything,

434
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:52,190
of course. Ballard was obviously mad. But
there were so many things that "didn't mean

435
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,410
anything" now that The Thinking Machine was
in the prison.

436
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:03,740
On the sixth day, the warden received a letter
from Dr Ransome. It said:

437
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,650
Dear Sir.

438
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:11,620
Mr Fielding and I will meet you in your office
tomorrow evening. If Professor Van Dasen has

439
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:17,810
not escaped - and we believe he has not because
we have not received a letter from him - we

440
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,830
will meet him there too.

441
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:24,390
Yours, Dr Ransome.

442
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:29,810
That day The Thinking Machine had three more
messages for the warden. They were written

443
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:35,880
on the same linen and referred to the meeting
with Dr Ransome and Mr Fielding.

444
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,400
On the afternoon of the seventh day the warden
passed Cell 13 and looked in. The Thinking

445
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,640
Machine was sleeping on his bed. Everything
in the cell was completely normal. "He cannot

446
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,310
escape between now and half-past eight this
evening," the warden thought.

447
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:59,640
That evening after six o'clock he saw the
guard. "Is everything all right in Cell 13?"

448
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:07,770
he asked. "Yes sir," replied the guard. "But
he didn't eat much today." The warden was

449
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:13,320
feeling happy when he met Dr Ransome and Mr
Fielding that evening, at seven o'clock. He

450
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,891
wanted to show them The Thinking Machine's
messages. He wanted to tell them about the

451
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:23,570
events of the week. But before he could speak,
the guard from the river side of the prison

452
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,820
yard came into the office.

453
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:33,640
"The light on my side of the yard is broken,"
the guard said. Oh no. Another problem," said

454
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:40,510
the warden. The guard returned to his post
in the dark. The warden called the electric

455
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,510
light company.

456
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:47,890
"Hello. This is Chisholm Prison," he said
into the phone. "One of our lights is broken.

457
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:54,480
Could you send four men here to repair it?
Thank you. Goodbye." The warden went out into

458
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,830
the yard. While Dr Ransome and Mr Fielding
were waiting, the guard from the prison gate

459
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:06,600
came into the office. In his hand was a letter.
Dr Ransome looked at the letter.

460
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:13,710
"Incredible!" he said. "What is it?" asked
Mr Fielding. The doctor gave him the letter.

461
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:19,960
Fielding looked at it. "It's a coincidence.
It must be," he said. It was almost eight

462
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,020
o'clock when the warden returned to his office.

463
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:29,200
"The electricians have arrived," he said.
"They are working on the light now."

464
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,160
The warden telephoned the guard at the prison
gate. "How many electricians came in?" he

465
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,010
asked. "Four," was the reply.

466
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:44,330
"All right. You must be certain that only
four men go out of the prison," said the warden.

467
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:47,280
He put down the phone and took the letter.

468
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,190
"My God! It's not possible," he said, shocked.

469
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:55,160
"What is it?" asked Mr Fielding.

470
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:01,430
"It's a letter from Cell 13," said the warden.
"An invitation to dinner!"

471
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:04,080
"What?" said Ransome.

472
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:09,680
The three men were silent for a long time.
Finally the warden called a guard.

473
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,670
"Go down to Cell 13 immediately," he said,
"and see if the Professor is still there."

474
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:21,080
The guard ran down the corridor. Dr Ransome
and Mr Fielding examined the letter.

475
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:27,890
"It's Van Dusen's handwriting; there's no
doubt about that," said Dr Ransome. "I've

476
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,810
seen too much of it."

477
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:37,850
At that moment the telephone rang again. It
was the guard at the prison gate. There were

478
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:43,190
two newspaper reporters and they wanted to
see the warden. The warden told the guard

479
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,190
to let them come in.

480
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:49,980
"It's impossible," he said. "Professor Van
Dusen must be in Cell 13."

481
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,120
Then the guard returned.

482
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:58,330
"He's still in his cell, sir," he said. "I
saw him. He's sleeping."

483
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:03,700
"There. I told you." said the warden. "But
if he is still in his cell how did he send

484
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,260
the letter?"

485
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,580
There was a knock at the door.

486
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:12,740
"It's the reporters," said the warden. "Come
in."

487
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:17,140
The door opened and the two men entered.

488
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:25,550
"Good evening, gentlemen," said one. It was
Hutchinson Hatch. The warden knew him well.

489
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,960
Then the second man came in.

490
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,220
"Well, I'm here," he said. It was The Thinking
Machine.

491
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:37,400
The warden sat with his mouth open. He was
paralyzed.

492
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:44,280
"How - how - how did you do it?" asked the
warden, finally.

493
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,410
"Let's go back to the cell," said The Thinking
Machine.

494
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,770
The men walked down the corridor to the door
of Cell 13.

495
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:55,570
"Look inside," said The Thinking Machine.

496
00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:00,880
The warden looked inside. Everything looked
normal and there - there on the bed was the

497
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,700
figure of The Thinking Machine. Certainly!
There was his yellow hair! The warden looked

498
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:11,170
again at the man beside him. "I must be mad,"
he thought.

499
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:16,500
Then he unlocked the cell door and The Thinking
Machine went inside.

500
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,580
"Look here," he said.

501
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:26,740
He put his foot on the steel bars at the bottom
of the cell door and three of them fell out.

502
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:35,810
"And here, too," The Thinking Machine stood
on his bed and put his hand to the bars on

503
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:39,190
the window. All of them came out.

504
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:42,830
"So what's this in the bed?" asked the warden.

505
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:47,840
"It's a wig," The Thinking Machine replied.
"Take the cover off."

506
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:55,160
The warden did this. Under it was a coil of
strong rope about ten metres long, a knife,

507
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:01,770
three files, three metres of electric wire,
a pair of steel pliers, a hammer and a pistol

508
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:07,820
"How did you do it?" asked the warden. "You
gentlemen have an invitation to dinner with

509
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:12,690
me at half-past nine," said The Thinking Machine.
"Come on, or we shall be late."

510
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,210
"But how did you do it?" the warden insisted.

511
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:21,620
"You cannot hold a man in prison who can use
his brain," replied The Thinking Machine.

512
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:28,200
"Come on, or we shall be late."

513
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:34,060
CHAPTER SIX
How Did He Do It?

514
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,550
When dinner was finished The Thinking Machine
turned to Dr Ransome.

515
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:41,270
"Well, do you believe me now?" he asked.

516
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:46,010
"Yes I do," replied Dr Ransome.

517
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:52,410
There was a long silence. Like all the other
guests, Ransome was waiting for the explanation.

518
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:57,290
"So, tell us how you did it," said Fielding,
finally.

519
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,890
The Thinking Machine began the story.

520
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:06,130
"The agreement was to go into a cell in Chisholm
Prison with nothing but the necessary clothes

521
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:11,440
and to leave that cell within seven days.
I didn't know Chisholm Prison. When I went

522
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,830
into the cell I asked for three things: toothpaste,
two ten-dollar bills and one five-dollar bill

523
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,700
and to have my shoes blacked. You agreed to
these things.

524
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:28,300
"I knew that there was nothing useful in the
cell, so I had to use these three innocent

525
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:33,950
things to help me escape. But anything is
dangerous in the hands of a man like me.

526
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:40,810
"The first night I did two things. I slept
and I ran after rats. You gentlemen thought

527
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:46,420
I wanted time to organize an escape with assistance
from outside the prison. But this was not

528
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:52,240
true. I knew I could communicate with anyone
I wanted to at any time."

529
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,530
The warden looked at him for a moment. The
Thinking Machine continued.

530
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:02,260
"The guard woke me up at six o'clock the next
morning. He brought me my breakfast. He told

531
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:07,990
me lunch was at twelve o'clock and dinner
was at six. I knew that between these times

532
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:15,230
I was alone. So after breakfast I examined
the outside area from my cell window. I saw

533
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:20,780
that it was impossible to get over the wall.
But I knew that on the other side of the wall

534
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:27,080
there was a river and also a playground. The
guard confirmed it. So I knew one important

535
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:32,810
thing. A person could come near the prison
on that side without attracting the attention

536
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,140
of the guards.

537
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:40,090
"But there was something even more important.
I saw a wire which went to the light on the

538
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:46,780
prison roof. It was very near my cell window.
I knew then that if it was necessary I could

539
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,330
cut off that light.

540
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:53,190
"Then I thought about escaping through the
prison building. I remembered the way to my

541
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:59,640
cell. I knew that was the only way out. There
were seven doors between my cell and the outside.

542
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,390
It was too difficult."

543
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:08,420
The Thinking Machine stopped for a moment.
Dr Ransome lit a new cigar. For several minutes

544
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,590
there was silence. Then The Thinking Machine
continued.

545
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:19,470
"When I was thinking about these things a
rat ran across my foot. It gave me a new idea.

546
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:23,820
I saw there were at least six rats in the
cell. But they didn't come from under the

547
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,480
door. I ran after them and they disappeared.
But they didn't go out of the door. So I knew

548
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,340
there was another way out.

549
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:37,350
"I looked for this other way and found it.
It was a hole in the floor. It went to an

550
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:44,231
old drainpipe. Obviously the rats came this
way. But where did they come from? Drainpipes

551
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:50,770
normally go outside the prison. This one probably
went to the river or near it. So the rats

552
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,610
came from that direction.

553
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:58,740
"When the guard came with my lunch he told
me two important things. One was that there

554
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:04,410
was a new plumbing system in the prison. The
other was that the river was only a hundred

555
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:10,990
metres away. So I knew that the pipe in my
cell was part of an old system. And I knew

556
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:16,720
it went to the river. The other end of the
pipe was outside the prison walls.

557
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,590
"But before I could start work, I knew I had
to distract the warden. I wanted him to think

558
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:27,560
that I was trying to communicate with you,
Dr Ransome. So I took two pieces of linen

559
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:32,480
from my shirt and wrote a message on them.
Do you have the message, warden?"

560
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,511
"Yes." The warden looked at the codec message.
"But what does it mean?" he asked. "Read it

561
00:46:38,511 --> 00:46:43,740
from right to left, beginning with the T"
said The Thinking Machine. "Don't consider

562
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,430
the division into words."

563
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:50,310
The warden read the message.

564
00:46:50,310 --> 00:47:03,980
"T-h-i-s," he began, "is not the way I intend
to escape." The warden smiled. "But what did

565
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,670
you write it with?"

566
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:11,460
"This," said The Thinking Machine. He put
his foot on the table. On it was the shoe

567
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,280
that he wore in prison. But the polish was
gone.

568
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,250
"The shoe polish, mixed with some water, was
my ink," said The Thinking Machine, "and the

569
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,730
metal end of the shoe lace was a good pen."

570
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:27,990
The warden laughed. "Continue," he said.

571
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:33,750
"After the message the warden wanted to search
my cell. This was good. I wanted him to search

572
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:39,510
my cell very often. I thought, 'He won't find
anything so he will stop and leave me alone.'

573
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:43,930
"The warden took my shirt away and gave me
a prison shirt.

574
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:48,380
Without my white shirt I couldn't write any
more messages. But I had another piece of

575
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,400
the same shirt in my mouth."

576
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,530
"Where did it come from?" asked the warden.
"I saw that there were only two pieces cut

577
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,060
from the shirt. And I had both of them."

578
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:03,100
"You forget that shirts like mine have three
layers of linen," The Thinking Machine replied.

579
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,670
"I took out the inside one. You didn't notice
it.

580
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:13,120
"Now that the warden was busy, I started to
work on my real escape plan. I knew that the

581
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:19,030
pipe from my cell went to the playground outside
the prison. It is a place where boys play

582
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:24,900
baseball. I knew many of the boys there. I
knew that the rats came into my cell from

583
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:30,731
out there. Perhaps it was possible for me
to communicate with someone outside. I could

584
00:48:30,731 --> 00:48:32,090
use the rats.

585
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:38,860
"The first thing I needed was a long thread.
So I used the thread from my socks." He pulled

586
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:45,070
up his trouser-legs. The strong thread at
the top of his long socks was not there.

587
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:51,520
"Then on one half of my last piece of linen
I wrote a message for Hutchinson Hatch. He

588
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,920
is a friend and often helps me. I knew he
would help me this time. It was a great story

589
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,521
for his newspaper. I tied a ten-dollar bill
to the letter to attract attention. People

590
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:08,210
always find money. I wrote on the linen: 'If
you find this message give it to Hutchinson

591
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:13,030
Hatch. He will give you another ten dollars
for the information.' Then I wrote instructions

592
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:14,090
for Hatch.

593
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:20,130
"I had to get this note outside the prison.
There were two ways but the best way was the

594
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:25,880
rats. I took one of them. I tied the linen
and the money to one of its legs and tied

595
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,910
my thread to another. Then I put it in the
pipe.

596
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:34,150
"From the moment the rat disappeared into
that dirty pipe I was nervous. The thread

597
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:40,340
could break. Anything could happen. I waited.
I was holding the thread and I saw that it

598
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:46,140
became gradually shorter. Finally there was
only about one metre of thread in my hand.

599
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:51,380
I knew that the rat was outside the prison.
But would Hatch receive the message?

600
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:57,530
"I had to wait. I decided to try some other
man oeuvres. This was to confuse the warden

601
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:02,800
more. I tried to bribe the guard. I tried
to cut through the bars on my cell window.

602
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,120
The warden became very angry. He took the
bars in his hands to see if they were solid.

603
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,280
They were - then.

604
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,630
"That night I didn't sleep. The thread was
tied to my hand. I waited for the signal from

605
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:21,930
outside. I thought. 'If Hatch has received
the message, and if he finds the drainpipe,

606
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:28,700
he will pull the thread.' At half-past three
in the morning I felt something pull the thread."

607
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,040
The Thinking Machine turned to Hutchinson
Hatch.

608
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,060
"Now you can explain what you did," he said.

609
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:41,110
"A small boy brought the linen message to
me. I gave the boy another ten dollars. I

610
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:46,760
got some string and then some wire. I went
with the boy to the playground. I looked for

611
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:53,140
the end of the drainpipe for an hour. Then
finally I found it. It was about thirty centimeters

612
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:59,220
in diameter. I took the end of the thread
and pulled it three times. The Professor pulled

613
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:05,940
twice to reply. Quickly I tied my string to
the Professor's thread. Then I tied the wire

614
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:12,460
to the string. Professor Van Dusen began to
pull it all into his cell. The wire was the

615
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:19,030
most important because it could not break.
The thread was too weak. It could break easily.

616
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:22,350
With the wire I could transport things to
the cell."

617
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:27,540
"Yes," continued The Thinking Machine. "I
was very happy when the wire arrived in the

618
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:33,740
cell. Then we tried another experiment. I
spoke to Mr Hatch through the pipe. He heard

619
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:39,460
me but it was not easy for him to understand
me. I wanted some nitric- acid and I had to

620
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:45,330
repeat the word 'acid' several times. Then
I heard a scream from the cell above me.

621
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:52,100
"With the wire it was easy to transport things
to my cell. And it was also easy to hide them.

622
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:57,340
I could put them into the pipe. You, Mr Warden,
found the pipe but you could not find the

623
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:03,760
wire. Your hands are too big. My fingers are
longer and thinner so it was easy for me.

624
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,240
In addition I put a dead rat in the pipe.
You pulled it out."

625
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,410
"I remember," said the warden.

626
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:15,540
"The rat was there to stop you investigating
the pipe," said The Thinking Machine.

627
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:21,570
"That night Mr Hatch could not send me anything
useful. But he did send me change for ten

628
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:26,250
dollars as a test. The next clay I continued
to work on my plan.

629
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:32,740
"For this it was necessary that the guard
outside saw me often at my cell window. To

630
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:38,440
attract his attention I threw messages to
him. I stood at my cell window for hours.

631
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:44,210
Sometimes I spoke to him. He told me that
there were no electricians inside the prison.

632
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:47,900
If there was a problem with the lights they
had to call the light company.

633
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:54,490
"This was perfect for my escape plan. There
was only one more thing to do before I escaped.

634
00:52:54,490 --> 00:53:00,900
Once again I spoke to Mr Hatch through the
pipe. It was the fourth night of my incarceration.

635
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:06,610
Again Mr Hatch could not understand me. Again
I repeated the word 'acid' three times. It

636
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:12,500
was this that made the prisoner above me confess
to murder. The guard told me the next day.

637
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,680
The prisoner heard strange voices through
the pipe. He thought it was a ghost.

638
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:22,700
"With nitric acid it was very easy to cut
the bars of the window. But it was a long

639
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:29,420
process. The outside guard saw me standing
at my window. He didn't know what I was doing.

640
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:34,860
As he watched me I cut the bars with a piece
of wire covered with acid. On the night of

641
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:40,301
my escape I used the same acid to cut the
electric wire that went to the lights. The

642
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:44,960
yard outside my window was completely dark.
It was easy to escape.

643
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:51,450
"I also had a wig from Mr Hatch. It was the
same color as my hair. Yellow. I put it in

644
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:55,470
the bed with some other things that Hatch
sent me. When the guard passed the door he

645
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,010
thought I was sleeping."

646
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:01,320
"But how did you get outside the prison gate,"
asked the warden.

647
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:06,960
"It was simple," The Thinking Machine replied.
"As I said. I cut the wire to the lights before

648
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,810
the guards turned on the current. When they
turned on the current, the light on my side

649
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:17,490
of the yard didn't work. The outside guard
went to your office to tell you and I escaped

650
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:23,041
through my cell window. I stayed in the shadows
until the four electricians arrived. Mr Hatch

651
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:24,250
was one of them.

652
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:30,180
"When I saw him he gave me some workman's
clothes to put on. You, Mr Warden, were standing

653
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:36,240
only three metres away. Then Mr Hatch called
me - as a workman - and together we went out

654
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,590
of the gate to get something from the van.
The guard at the gate knew that there were

655
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:46,560
four workers in the yard. He saw that we were
workers so he let us go out of the prison.

656
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:51,630
Then we changed clothes and came back in.
We went to your office and asked to see you.

657
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,230
That's all."

658
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:56,850
"And the letter of invitation?" asked Ransome.

659
00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:02,570
"I wrote it in my cell with Mr Hatch's pen,"
said The Thinking Machine. "Then I sent it

660
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:06,640
through the pipe and Mr Hatch posted it."

661
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:12,500
There was silence for several minutes. Dr
Ransome was the first to speak.

662
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:17,410
"Incredible!" he said. "Absolutely brilliant!"

663
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:20,400
But Mr Fielding had two more questions.

664
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,930
"And what was the toothpaste for?" he asked.

665
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:25,720
"For brushing my teeth."

666
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:29,120
"Why did Mr Hatch come with the electricians?"

667
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:33,360
"His father is the manager of the company,"
said The Thinking Machine.

668
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,790
"But what if there was no Mr Hatch outside
to help you?"

669
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:41,020
"Every prisoner has at least one friend who
will help him if he can."

670
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:45,510
"What if there was no old drainpipe in your
cell," asked the warden.

671
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:50,010
"There were another two ways to escape," said
The Thinking Machine.

672
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:57,810
Ten minutes later the telephone rang. It was
for the warden.

673
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:04,650
"Is the light working now?" asked the warden
through the phone. "Good. The wire was cut

674
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:13,140
beside Cell 13? Yes I know. What's that? There
are too many electricians. Two went out of

675
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:20,860
the prison and there are three still inside.
But only four men came from the light company."

676
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,940
The warden turned to the others, confused.

677
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:30,270
"The guard says that he saw four electricians
come into the prison. Two went out again.

678
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:33,390
But there are still three men inside," he
said.

679
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:38,650
"Don't you remember? I was the extra man,"
said The Thinking Machine.

680
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:45,360
"Oh," said the warden. "I see." He turned
back to the phone. "You can let the fifth

681
00:56:45,360 --> 00:57:01,580
man go. He's all right."

682
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:10,510
- THE END -
