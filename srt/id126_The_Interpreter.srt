00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,520
CHAPTER ONE
The Voice in the Dark

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,270
Matobo, Africa

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,870
The hot sun burned down on the small town.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,250
An old wooden sign above the road was shaking
in the strong wind.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:27,630
The words on it were unclear now, but it read:
WELCOME PRESIDENT EDMOND ZUWANIE.

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,240
The car moved slowly down the road.

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,010
The driver was a black African man.

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:42,010
Next to him, a fair-haired white man was writing
a list of names in a blue notebook.

9
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:48,719
Another white man with long, dark hair sat
in the back seat, holding two cameras.

10
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,769
"She refused to tell me her husband's name,"
the white man in the front seat shouted above

11
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:58,889
the noise of the wind.

12
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:04,720
"The names of the dead are bad luck," the
driver replied.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,570
"Zuwanie murdered half the town.

14
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,800
Can their luck get worse?"

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,920
The driver slowed the car.

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,510
"He can murder the other half."

17
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,090
The fair-haired white man put a gun and a
new notebook into his bag.

18
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,390
He and the driver climbed out of the car.

19
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,410
"Stay here," the driver said to the cameraman.

20
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:38,590
Slowly, the two men walked across the street
toward a large, old stadium.

21
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:45,520
Outside, two boys kicked a ball around the
dry, brown grass.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,800
One of the boys shouted to the two men.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,670
"They want to show us the bodies," the driver
said.

24
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,370
The boys took the men into a room inside the
stadium.

25
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,960
There was a strong smell of death.

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,340
The men covered their noses and told the boys
to go outside.

27
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:14,010
In the dark corners of the room, they could
see piles of bodies on the floor.

28
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,569
"XOLA NOW!"

29
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,799
was written in blood on the walls.

30
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:24,290
They started to check the bodies.

31
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,660
They recognized some of the dead and found
the names of others from the papers in their

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,730
pockets.

33
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:37,310
The white man pulled the notebook out of his
bag and started to write.

34
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,939
Suddenly, there was a shout from one of the
boys outside.

35
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:43,840
"Somebody's coming!"

36
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,409
the white man said.

37
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:49,840
The two men ran out into the bright sunlight.

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,840
There was nobody outside - only the two boys.

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,810
Slowly, one boy lifted a gun and shot the
black African in the chest.

40
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,230
Then he turned to the white man and shot him
in the stomach.

41
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,060
The white man fell to his knees.

42
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,879
"It's OK," he said quietly.

43
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,310
"It's OK."

44
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,819
It was the last thing that he ever said.

45
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:24,230
The boy stood over the body.

46
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:32,519
"The Teacher says, 'Good day to you,'" he
whispered.

47
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,230
Hiding in the back of the car, the cameraman
took some photos.

48
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:44,529
Then he quietly climbed out of the car and
disappeared into the trees.

49
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:48,239
A few minutes later, another vehicle arrived.

50
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,780
The door opened and three soldiers climbed
out.

51
00:03:51,780 --> 00:04:01,769
A tall, well-dressed African man followed
them and walked slowly toward the stadium.

52
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,209
The United Nations Building, New York

53
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,959
The main hall was full of people.

54
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,970
Ambassadors from around the world and their
assistants were listening to the Spanish Ambassador's

55
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,510
speech.

56
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:24,840
The interpreters sat in glass booths above
them, repeating his words into Chinese, Russian,

57
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,630
French, Arabic...

58
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:35,750
Outside the hall, U.N. Security Chief Lee
Wu spoke to Assistant Chief Rory Robb: "There's

59
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,830
a security problem at the main entrance.

60
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,230
Put the Secretary-General in the safe room.

61
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,260
Take the Spanish Ambassador out of the building,
then get everybody out."

62
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:57,290
A U.N. guard came into the English interpreters'
booth as Silvia Broome finished interpreting

63
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,290
the Spanish Ambassador's words into English.

64
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,850
"Can you leave the building quickly, please?"

65
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,650
the guard said.

66
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:14,280
Silvia, a tall woman of about thirty, with
long fair hair and clear blue eyes, picked

67
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,380
up her coat but left her music case in the
booth.

68
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,180
"I'm teaching a student tonight," she said.

69
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,170
"This bag's heavy and I don't want to take
it downstairs.

70
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,690
I'll get it later."

71
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,770
The U.N. security officers worked quickly
and emptied the building.

72
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:41,670
Then they took the Spanish Ambassador outside
to his car.

73
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:47,450
Rory Robb watched the large black car drive
through the U.N. gates.

74
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,740
He used his radio to call his chief.

75
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,030
"The Spanish Ambassador has left the U.N.,"
he said.

76
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,560
"He's in the U.S. again."

77
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,430
Silvia spent the next few hours in a restaurant
with a group of other interpreters.

78
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,020
It was nine o'clock at night when she returned
to the U.N. building.

79
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,590
She didn't see anyone as she ran upstairs.

80
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,750
She opened the door to the interpreters' booth
and picked up her music case.

81
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,190
Suddenly, she heard a man's voice.

82
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:29,740
"The Teacher will never leave this room,"
he whispered.

83
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,690
He was speaking in Ku, the language of Matobo.

84
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,050
Silvia turned on a light and looked at her
desk.

85
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,310
One of the microphones in the hall below was
still switched on.

86
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,140
As the booth lit up, the man stopped talking.

87
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:55,420
Quickly, Silvia switched off the light, but
it was too late.

88
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:01,330
She couldn't see him, but he could see her.

89
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,040
She was shaking as she left the booth and
ran down the stairs.

90
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,220
She heard footsteps, then a door opened and
closed.

91
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,860
Someone was following her.

92
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:21,050
She ran into the nearest room - the men's
restroom - and hid behind the door.

93
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,280
The footsteps came nearer and stopped outside.

94
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,410
Silvia pressed her back against the wall.

95
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:35,680
Then, slowly, the footsteps moved away.

96
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:43,110
At the same time, on the other side of town,
Secret Service Agent Tobin Keller, a tall,

97
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:49,980
thin man with tired, sad brown eyes, was sitting
alone in a bar.

98
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,780
He sat there for a long time, then he went
to the pay phone in the corner of the room

99
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,410
and called his apartment.

100
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:04,630
A woman's voice on the answering machine said,
"You've reached the Keller's.

101
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,390
We're out having a good time.

102
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,570
Please leave a message."

103
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,950
It was his wife's voice.

104
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:18,770
He put more money into the pay phone and called
the number again.

105
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,210
And again.

106
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,310
And again.

107
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,650
CHAPTER TWO
Truth or Lies?

108
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:35,490
The next morning, Silvia went to a garage
near her apartment and unlocked her motorcycle.

109
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,779
She didn't see the well-dressed African man
who was watching from his car.

110
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,240
Silvia moved quickly through the busy traffic.

111
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,060
Looking in her mirror, she saw the large black
car behind her.

112
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,740
When she moved faster, the car moved faster,
too.

113
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,300
Soon it was very close to her.

114
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,730
Suddenly, the stoplight in front of her turned
red.

115
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:09,570
She rode through the light, but the car had
to stop.

116
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,610
When she arrived at the U.N. building, she
went to the interpreters' restroom.

117
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,820
She put her purse and coat in her locker.

118
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,890
The cleaner smiled at her and said something
in Portuguese.

119
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:29,340
Silvia smiled back at him, then ran upstairs
to her booth.

120
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:35,460
In a room near the main hall, the French Ambassador
was speaking to fifteen other ambassadors

121
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,940
and the Secretary-General.

122
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,720
"There are two rebel chiefs," he said.

123
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,460
"Xola is hiding in Africa.

124
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,020
Kuman-Kuman is here in New York.

125
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,450
They can't stop Zuwanie from killing people
in Matobo.

126
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,580
The killing isn't going to stop.

127
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:04,380
So we want the U.N. to send Dr. Zuwanie to
the International Criminal Court immediately."

128
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,640
The American Ambassador looked worried.

129
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,580
She turned to her assistant.

130
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,630
"Get the interpreter," she whispered.

131
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,070
The assistant found Silvia.

132
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:21,890
"We need you for a few minutes," he said,
and Silvia followed him downstairs.

133
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,340
"This is a private meeting."

134
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,250
"We'd like you to interpret for both sides."

135
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,860
"What language?"

136
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,150
Silvia asked.

137
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,200
"It's a meeting with the Matoban Ambassador.

138
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,240
He'll speak Ku."

139
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,390
Silvia was surprised.

140
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:48,589
She spoke the Matoban language, but she wasn't
the U.N. interpreter for Ku.

141
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:50,820
"What's happening?"

142
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,750
she asked.

143
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,890
The assistant spoke quietly.

144
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:04,830
"The French want to send Zuwanie to the ICC
for his crimes against his people."

145
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,470
The Matoban Ambassador walked into the room
with three other men.

146
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:19,000
"This is my assistant, Marcus Matu," he said
in Ku, pointing to a tall, very thin man.

147
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,350
"President Zuwanie is a problem," the American
Ambassador said in English.

148
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,650
Silvia interpreted her words into Ku.

149
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:37,000
"Dr. Zuwanie is our teacher," the Matoban
Ambassador replied in Ku.

150
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,090
"The rebels - Kuman-Kuman and Ajene Xola - and
their friends are the problem."

151
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:51,920
"The United States doesn't recognize the ICC,"
the American Ambassador said angrily.

152
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,690
"But we want President Zuwanie to leave Matobo.

153
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,090
He can take a long vacation or spend time
with his family.

154
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,660
If he leaves, the French plan will fail.

155
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,260
Tell him that."

156
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:14,460
"You can tell him," the Matoban Ambassador
said in perfect English.

157
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,160
"President Zuwanie will talk to the United
Nations next Friday.

158
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,730
He will promise to make changes to his government.

159
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:31,750
The U.N. will not vote, and your problem will
disappear."

160
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,420
He and his men walked out of the room.

161
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:44,550
Silvia remembered the words from the night
before: "The Teacher will never leave this

162
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,550
room."

163
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,750
Edmond Zuwanie was "the Teacher."

164
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,790
Did somebody want to kill him in the U.N.
building?

165
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,770
She had to tell someone.

166
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:05,870
Later that day, Silvia sat in the U.N. Security
Office with Chief Wu and Rory Robb.

167
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,740
"Why didn't you call us last night?"

168
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,190
Rory said.

169
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:16,390
"I was scared, so I went home," Silvia replied.

170
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,020
"Did you see anyone?"

171
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,810
Rory asked.

172
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,250
"No," she answered, "but they saw me.

173
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:31,580
I didn't understand the words, but today the
Matoban Ambassador called President Zuwanie

174
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,340
'the Teacher.'

175
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,630
Zuwanie's coming here on Friday."

176
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:43,140
"Call the Secret Service," Chief Wu said.

177
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,630
Secret Service Agent Dot Woods took the phone
call.

178
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:54,820
An hour later, she and Tobin Keller drove
across New York to the U.N. building.

179
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,080
Tobin's bag was on the back seat of the car.

180
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,350
"Did you go home last night?"

181
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,430
Dot asked.

182
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,260
Tobin shook his head but didn't speak.

183
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,710
"I went to a party," Dot said.

184
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,339
"It was somebody's birthday and I had to sing.

185
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,220
You know I can't -"

186
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,410
Tobin held up his hand.

187
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,000
"Dot," he said quietly.

188
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,960
"Stop.

189
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,600
You don't have to talk."

190
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,420
"OK."

191
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:37,830
There were ten or twelve protesters outside
the U.N. One man held a sign: "ZUWANIE MUST

192
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,100
NOT SPEAK!"

193
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,180
At the door to the building, a U.N. policeman
stopped Dot and Tobin.

194
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,290
Dot gave him her gun and showed her security
card.

195
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,500
"We're Secret Service," she said.

196
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,320
The policeman took the card and looked at
it carefully.

197
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,540
Then he typed their names into a computer.

198
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,399
"Secret Service!"

199
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,650
Tobin said angrily.

200
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:10,890
"Part of the United States government!"

201
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,740
Dot touched his arm.

202
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,270
"He's new, Tobin," she said quietly.

203
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,930
The policeman picked up a phone.

204
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:27,279
"You're not in the United States now, you're
in the United Nations.

205
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,670
Wait here.

206
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,790
Somebody will meet you."

207
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:38,060
Rory Robb came to the security gate and took
them to Chief Wu's office.

208
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,170
"Zuwanie arrives at 08:45 on Friday," Dot
said.

209
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,090
"We'll meet him at the airport and bring him
here.

210
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,220
He won't go shopping, and he won't visit the
theater.

211
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,310
He'll speak to the U.N., and then he'll leave.

212
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,610
Why is he coming here?"

213
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:07,290
"The U.N. wants to take Mr. Zuwanie to the
ICC," Chief Wu replied.

214
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:12,200
"He's going to promise changes so they change
their minds."

215
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:20,110
"Tell me about the interpreter," Tobin said,
looking at a photo of Silvia.

216
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,860
"She was born in the United States," Wu explained.

217
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,000
"She spent most of her life in Africa and
Europe.

218
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,800
She studied in South Africa, France, and Spain.

219
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,940
She has a British mother and a white African
father.

220
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,649
She's worked in the U.N. for five years."

221
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:48,930
Tobin and Dot went down to the U.N. entrance
hall.

222
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:55,740
Silvia was talking to another interpreter,
and Tobin recognized her face from the photo.

223
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,690
He gave her his card.

224
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:02,300
"Ms. Woods and I are with the Secret Service,"
he said.

225
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,299
"We protect heads of state at the U.N."

226
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:10,549
"I don't recognize you," Silvia said.

227
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:14,000
"Our faces are easy to forget.

228
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,740
That's why we're good at our jobs."

229
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,180
Silvia smiled and pointed at Dot.

230
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,800
"Is she guarding you?"

231
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,140
she asked.

232
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,010
"Yes, ma'am," Tobin replied.

233
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,470
"I'm not a head of state," she said.

234
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,360
"I know," he said.

235
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,770
"What did you hear?

236
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,370
If you hear the voice again, will you recognize
it?"

237
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,840
"I don't know.

238
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,799
It was a whisper.

239
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,100
Whispers change voices."

240
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,220
"Do they?"

241
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,220
Tobin asked.

242
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,059
"You study faces, I study voices."

243
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:01,210
"You were in the interpreters' booth at night.

244
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,410
Why?"

245
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,510
Tobin asked.

246
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:09,520
"There was a security problem and I left the
building," Silvia replied.

247
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,510
"I went back later for my music bag."

248
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:19,300
"And you heard two guys," Tobin said slowly.

249
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:26,470
"They were planning to kill somebody, and
they were talking in Ku.

250
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,900
Not many people speak Ku.

251
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,580
You do."

252
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,280
"You think I'm lying!"

253
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,270
Silvia protested angrily.

254
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,750
"People lie all the time."

255
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,299
"I don't," she said.

256
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:47,760
"What do you think about Zuwanie?"

257
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,920
Tobin asked.

258
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,809
"I don't like him."

259
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:54,580
"Do you want him to die?"

260
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,690
"I want him to leave Matobo," Silvia said
quickly.

261
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,620
"That's different.

262
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,210
I told the U.N. security officers so you can
protect him.

263
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,920
I'm not here to watch people die."

264
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,820
"'Here'?"

265
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,830
Tobin asked.

266
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:20,540
"In the U.N. I believe in this place, not
in guns and war.

267
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:26,070
Listen - they saw me and I'm scared!"

268
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,650
"You don't look scared," Tobin said.

269
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,360
"You don't know me," Silvia said.

270
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,610
"You don't know what I feel.

271
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:42,010
People don't always cry when they feel sad.

272
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,220
I'll find another person to protect me."

273
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,550
"I'm not your protector, ma'am," Tobin said
quietly.

274
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,220
"I protect heads of state.

275
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,540
I'm here to question you."

276
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,040
Silvia gave Tobin his card and walked angrily
away.

277
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,610
"What do you think?"

278
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,809
Dot asked.

279
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:11,100
"She's lying."

280
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,919
CHAPTER THREE
Zuwanie and the Rebels

281
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:23,010
Tobin and Dot returned to the Secret Service
offices in another part of New York.

282
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:29,640
As they walked through the building, some
people said quietly, "Hi, Keller."

283
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,980
Some looked away from him.

284
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,049
Two men were standing outside Tobin's office.

285
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:39,710
"We're Special Agents Lewis and King," one
said.

286
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,630
"We're here to help."

287
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,950
Tobin's boss, Jay Pettigrew, arrived.

288
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,740
"Are you OK?" he asked.

289
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,299
"Yes," Tobin said.

290
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:54,820
"I feel better."

291
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,380
"The President called me this morning.

292
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,680
He's worried.

293
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,750
He doesn't want Zuwanie to die over here.

294
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,970
Get him out of the U.N. and out of the United
States.

295
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,350
Use agents from any other organization that
you want."

296
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:17,960
Tobin and Dot left the Secret Service offices
and went to the CIA.

297
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,870
They talked to Agent Jon Hassrow.

298
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:27,380
"Years ago, Edmond Zuwanie was a good guy,"
Hassrow told them.

299
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,290
"Matobo had a very bad government.

300
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,860
Zuwanie freed the people and they loved him.

301
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,280
Then he changed."

302
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,030
He showed them pictures of Zuwanie.

303
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,419
In each photo, the African president held
a gun.

304
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:50,480
Then Hassrow showed them some pictures of
dead bodies.

305
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,380
"Zuwanie murdered 32,000 Ku this year.

306
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,790
Every year he kills more people.

307
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,910
Matobo is a dangerous place - and it's getting
worse."

308
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:08,380
"Who wants him to die?"

309
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,380
Tobin asked.

310
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:16,800
"Millions of people - and these two men."

311
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,360
Jon showed them a photo of a handsome young
African man.

312
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,850
"This is Ajene Xola.

313
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,520
He's a doctor's son and he went to school
in Paris.

314
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,440
He was a peace protester, but now..."

315
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,710
"And that one?"

316
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,880
Dot asked.

317
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,830
Jon picked up a photo of an older African
man with guards around him.

318
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,160
"That's the man with two names," Tobin said.

319
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,560
"I read about him in the newspapers every
day."

320
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,080
"One name, used twice," Jon said.

321
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
"Kuman-Kuman.

322
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,210
He lives here in New York.

323
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,330
He was Zuwanie's friend, but now they're enemies.

324
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,360
He got too close to the President's daughter.

325
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,580
Kuman-Kuman says that Zuwanie is a madman.

326
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:19,429
Both Kuman-Kuman and Xola are popular, and
they both want Zuwanie to die."

327
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:26,510
"They want him to die in the United Nations,"
Tobin said, "in front of ambassadors from

328
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,300
191 countries.

329
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,860
In front of the news cameras - in front of
the world."

330
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,620
He gave Jon some papers.

331
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,190
"This is the interpreter," he said.

332
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,570
"Find out everything about her."

333
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,380
Dot drove Tobin to the Matoban government
offices before she returned to the Secret

334
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,809
Service building.

335
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:58,380
Tobin went into the office of Nils Lud, a
tall, middle-aged white man, President Zuwanie's

336
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,040
head of security.

337
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,309
"Tell me about the interpreter," Lud said.

338
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:06,750
He started to make coffee.

339
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,380
"Is she lying?

340
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,980
Is she pretty?"

341
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,210
Tobin gave Lud some papers.

342
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,240
"This is the U.N.'s information about her.

343
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,690
She has a Matoban passport."

344
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,299
Lud looked surprised.

345
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,539
"Does she?"

346
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:29,390
"She was born here," Tobin said.

347
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,210
"Are you serious?"

348
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,830
Lud asked.

349
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,490
"Yes," Tobin replied.

350
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,770
"Black or white?"

351
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,500
Lud asked.

352
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,700
Tobin looked at the coffee pot.

353
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,780
"No, thanks."

354
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,210
"Is she black or white?"

355
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,289
Lud said angrily.

356
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:53,890
"White."

357
00:24:53,890 --> 00:25:00,010
"We need to find out - is she lying or not?"

358
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:06,080
That night, Silvia returned to her apartment.

359
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,420
It was small and colorful, with African masks
and photos on the walls.

360
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,510
She lifted the phone, then put it down.

361
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,570
She took her cell phone out of her purse and
opened it.

362
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,000
Then she closed it and put it in her pocket.

363
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,520
She ran out of the apartment to a pay phone,
called a number in France, and listened to

364
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,390
the message on the answering machine.

365
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,309
"This is Broullet.

366
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:35,039
Leave a message."

367
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,120
"Philippe.

368
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,289
It's Silvia.

369
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:40,740
I must talk to you.

370
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,250
Can you call me?

371
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:47,690
No, don't call me - I'll call you later."

372
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,309
She left the phone booth and walked nervously
down the street.

373
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:54,560
There was a young black man behind her.

374
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,010
A cell phone rang.

375
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,470
The young man stopped and pulled his phone
out of his pocket.

376
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,630
"Hi, Mom," he said.

377
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:10,220
Dot watched from across the street, as she
spoke into her phone to the young black man.

378
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,940
"Agent Sample," she said, "you're too close."

379
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,600
Doug Sample laughed.

380
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,450
"Yes, Mom, things are OK.

381
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,700
My boss is a problem, but..."

382
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,590
Silvia smiled.

383
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,980
He was just another worker walking home.

384
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,770
She went back into her apartment building.

385
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:40,800
The well-dressed African man sat in his car
on the other side of the street.

386
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,940
He watched Silvia, Dot, and Doug Sample.

387
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,060
Nobody saw him.

388
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:54,350
When she was inside her apartment, Silvia
turned on the light in her living room, took

389
00:26:54,350 --> 00:27:00,090
some new notebooks out of a shopping bag,
and put them on the table.

390
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:06,490
She wrote an address on a large envelope and
put the notebooks inside the envelope.

391
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:13,070
Then she walked slowly to the window and looked
down at the dark street.

392
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:18,650
On the other side of the city, Tobin was opening
his apartment door.

393
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:23,650
He went into the living room and looked at
the photos on the wall.

394
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:29,600
He and his wife were eating, sailing, laughing.

395
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,390
There was a big picture of his wife dancing.

396
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:39,610
He sat next to the phone, turned on the answering
machine, and listened to a message from his

397
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,470
wife.

398
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,950
He listened to the same message every night.

399
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,169
"Hi," her voice said.

400
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,460
"I'm sitting here, thinking...

401
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,749
I made a mistake.

402
00:27:55,749 --> 00:27:57,030
Are you there?

403
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,320
I want to come back.

404
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,809
I told him.

405
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:04,620
He'll take me to the airport.

406
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,630
Will you meet me?

407
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,260
I'll call you when I get there.

408
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:14,159
I hope you haven't changed the locks."

409
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,150
Then there was another message, a male voice
this time.

410
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:23,030
"This is Officer Luper, New Mexico State Police.

411
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,710
I want to speak to Tobin Keller.

412
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,030
Please call me at 812-HIGHWAY.

413
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,409
Thank you."

414
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:41,260
Then a third message from a different man:
"This is Doctor Cleary, calling from Albuquerque

415
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,820
General Hospital.

416
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:50,470
I'm sorry, but -" And Tobin's own voice: "Yes?

417
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,059
Hello?"

418
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:54,940
The final message was from Dot.

419
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,230
"Tobin?

420
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,640
Are you there?"

421
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,640
she asked.

422
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,809
"I just heard.

423
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:01,809
I...

424
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:04,320
I don't know what to say.

425
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,230
I'll call you later.

426
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,919
I'm thinking about you."

427
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,670
And the recording ended.

428
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,870
Tobin looked around the empty room.

429
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:22,050
Then he picked up a bag and left the apartment.

430
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,360
CHAPTER FOUR
The Photo

431
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:32,150
The next morning, Silvia sat in a small office
in the Secret Service building.

432
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,990
"Put your hand in this machine," an agent
said.

433
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,570
"I'm going to ask you some questions.

434
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,809
The machine will check your answers."

435
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:46,970
Tobin and Nils Lud watched through a one-way
window.

436
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:51,280
"I have some information," Lud said.

437
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,660
"Her parents had a farm in the Mukwa Mountains.

438
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,789
In the 1980s, the mountains were full of rebels
and soldiers.

439
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:04,960
Her parents were driving her younger sister
home from school, and they were killed by

440
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,460
accident, by Dr. Zuwanie's soldiers."

441
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,970
"How old was Silvia?"

442
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,970
Tobin asked.

443
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,670
"Twelve or thirteen," Lud replied.

444
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:21,600
"She will never forget - or forgive - Dr.
Zuwanie.

445
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,200
I think she wants the U.N. to send him to
the ICC."

446
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,169
The agent came into the room.

447
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:33,929
"Can you come with me, sir?" he said to Tobin.

448
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:37,520
"I've done the test, but the results aren't
clear.

449
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,770
I don't know if she's telling the truth."

450
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,010
They left the room.

451
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:49,900
Lud watched Silvia through the window, and
then he went quietly into the office and stood

452
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,780
behind Silvia.

453
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,490
"How were the results?"

454
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,490
she asked.

455
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:01,049
"I don't know," Lud replied.

456
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:03,270
Silvia turned quickly.

457
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,549
Lud smiled and held out his hand.

458
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:11,710
"I'm Nils Lud, Dr. Zuwanie's head of security.

459
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:16,350
I want to ask you some questions, too."

460
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,980
Silvia watched him carefully as she shook
his hand.

461
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,250
"What's your opinion of Dr. Zuwanie, Ms. Broome?"

462
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,250
Lud asked.

463
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,390
"Do you believe that he's a good man?"

464
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:35,299
"I believe in peace and quiet, Mr. Lud," Silvia
said.

465
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:38,179
"That's why I'm at the U.N."

466
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:42,039
"You are not an ambassador.

467
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:44,120
You only interpret."

468
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,380
He stopped for a second, then continued.

469
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,169
"You heard a whisper.

470
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:57,309
So it will probably be difficult for you to
recognize the speaker?"

471
00:31:57,309 --> 00:31:59,640
Silvia looked at him.

472
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,250
"Maybe," she said slowly.

473
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,330
Suddenly, Lud moved closer to her.

474
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:11,840
"Tell me... do you have a brother?" he asked.

475
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,720
Silvia pulled away from him.

476
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,990
The door opened and Tobin walked in.

477
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:21,480
He looked angrily at Lud, then spoke to Silvia.

478
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,860
"You can go.

479
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,179
An agent will take you back to the U.N."

480
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:32,640
Silvia left the room quickly, and Tobin turned
to Lud.

481
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,630
"There are no results from the test," he said
coldly.

482
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,620
"But I believe her.

483
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:46,470
And next time you want to question an American
in the United States Secret Service offices,

484
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,530
ask my permission."

485
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:54,679
As Silvia and Lud left the building, Tobin
and Dot showed some other agents the pictures

486
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:58,920
of Zuwanie, Xola, and Kuman-Kuman.

487
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,850
"I'm from Brooklyn," Agent Mohammad said.

488
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,850
"OK, Mo.

489
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,299
You can follow Kuman-Kuman.

490
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:09,150
You and -"

491
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,039
Another man spoke.

492
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,930
"I was with him when he first came from Matobo."

493
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:20,690
"OK, Agent Ostroff, you can work with Mo.

494
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,370
Now, Xola," Tobin continued.

495
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:29,620
"The CIA has a list of his friends here in
the U.S.

496
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,300
We'll get it soon.

497
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,870
We're looking at the protesters, too."

498
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,240
Pettigrew came into the room.

499
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,080
"I want to talk to you and Dot," he said to
Tobin.

500
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,059
They moved away from the other agents.

501
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,549
"What's happening?"

502
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,200
Pettigrew asked.

503
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,809
"She only heard a whisper," Tobin said.

504
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:57,640
"She won't recognize the voice."

505
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,670
"The killers don't know that," Pettigrew said.

506
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:05,720
"Wait a minute, Jay," Tobin protested.

507
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,520
"That puts Silvia in danger.

508
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,460
They'll try to stop her..."

509
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:16,119
"We've only got three days," Pettigrew said
angrily.

510
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:19,879
He turned and walked away.

511
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:23,379
An hour later, Tobin had a call from Nils
Lud.

512
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:26,730
"I'm sending you a photo.

513
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,510
Can you print the front and back of it?"

514
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,679
"Yes," Tobin replied.

515
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,050
He looked at his computer and waited for the
picture.

516
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,920
"Listen," he continued.

517
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:45,520
"I need the names of everyone in the U.N.
who arrived from Africa in the last six months,

518
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,980
and a list of everyone at the Matoban offices
here."

519
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,270
"Why?"

520
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,409
Lud asked.

521
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:58,080
"We want the interpreter to listen to their
voices," Tobin said.

522
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,750
"It was only a whisper..."

523
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,200
Lud said slowly.

524
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,590
"She wants to try.

525
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:09,690
She thinks she can recognize the voice."

526
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:16,750
Lud was silent for a minute, then he said,
"Do you have the photo?

527
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,270
Look at it carefully.

528
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,990
It's a protest against Zuwanie.

529
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,370
The speaker is Ajene Xola.

530
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,460
Look at the crowd...

531
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,160
look closely."

532
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,730
There was a young white woman in the crowd.

533
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,270
The picture wasn't clear.

534
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:41,670
Was it Silvia?

535
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:47,080
CHAPTER FIVE
The African Mask

536
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,800
It was early evening and there were more protesters
outside the U.N. building.

537
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,010
Tobin sat in the main hall.

538
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:03,760
"When Zuwanie speaks, this room will be full
of people," he said to himself.

539
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,310
"Will the killer be here too?

540
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:12,670
How will he try to kill the President?"

541
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,790
Silvia came in behind him.

542
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,340
"Do you have any more information?"

543
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,490
she asked.

544
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:23,320
"A little," Tobin said.

545
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,490
He took the photo out of his pocket and put
it on a desk.

546
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,910
"Is this you?"

547
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,010
Silvia turned over the photo.

548
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,470
There were names on the back.

549
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:41,170
"It was a peaceful protest," she said.

550
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,660
"I was listening."

551
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,599
"And after you listened?"

552
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:51,570
"You're asking the wrong questions," Silvia
said angrily.

553
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,380
'Why was this picture taken?

554
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,380
Why were the names written on the back?"

555
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,970
"Because it's important information.

556
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,930
We do the same thing here in the U.S."

557
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,660
"In Matobo, it's different.

558
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,430
A protest is a crime in Matobo.

559
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,760
And this is a death list.

560
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,450
Who gave you this - and why?"

561
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,359
"You're hiding something," Tobin said.

562
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:23,750
"What is it?

563
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,410
How do you feel about Zuwanie?"

564
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:33,250
"I feel... sad," Silvia said slowly.

565
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,220
"Don't you feel angry?

566
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,070
Don't you want Zuwanie to go to court?

567
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:43,200
He hurt you, his soldiers killed your -"'

568
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,560
She touched his mouth with her hand.

569
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,130
"Shh," she said.

570
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:52,070
"We don't name the dead."

571
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:56,920
Slowly, she took her hand away from his face.

572
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,500
"Everyone is angry when they lose someone.

573
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:06,060
But in Africa, in Matobo, it's different.

574
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:10,320
To stop sadness, you must save a life.

575
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,369
That's what the Ku believe.

576
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:18,920
When someone is murdered there's an all-night
party one year later, next to a river.

577
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,560
In the morning, the dead man's relatives bring
out the killer, tie him up, and put him in

578
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
a boat.

579
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,730
They take him out onto the water and throw
him in.

580
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:33,109
He can't swim.

581
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:38,580
The family can watch him die, but they will
always be sad.

582
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:44,610
The act of saving him will take away their
sadness.

583
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:50,750
They will realize that life isn't always fair."

584
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:58,820
She stopped for a few seconds, and then she
said, "It's too easy to take a life."

585
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,869
She pointed at the photo.

586
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:05,670
"That was a long time ago.

587
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,670
I 'm leaving.

588
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,430
I have a class."

589
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:14,020
Later that night, Silvia sat in her apartment
and thought about Africa.

590
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:20,660
She remembered the open spaces and the animals,
the sound of African music, and the hills

591
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,900
in the early morning sun.

592
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,410
She closed her eyes.

593
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:32,970
She remembered an African man, the man that
she loved.

594
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,770
She opened her eyes and looked at her photos.

595
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:42,020
Then she looked up at the African masks on
the wall.

596
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,020
One was missing!

597
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,230
The telephone rang and she ran to it.

598
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:51,400
"Hello?" she said nervously.

599
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,089
"Philippe?

600
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:54,780
Hello?"

601
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,770
Nobody replied.

602
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,599
She put the phone down and turned to the window.

603
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,200
A man was standing on the fire escape.

604
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,500
He was wearing the missing mask and he had
a cell phone in his hand.

605
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:16,160
He put his finger to his mouth and whispered,
"Shhh."

606
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,430
Silvia screamed.

607
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:25,460
When Tobin arrived at Silvia's apartment twenty
minutes later, there were already a lot of

608
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,990
police officers and Secret Service agents
outside the building.

609
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,270
"What happened?"

610
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,290
Tobin asked Dot.

611
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:38,150
"Somebody took a mask from the wall," Dot
said.

612
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,839
"He went up the fire escape.

613
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:44,930
When she saw him, he put a finger to his mouth.

614
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,300
Somebody doesn't want her to talk."

615
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,460
"Did Doug see him?"

616
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,750
Tobin asked.

617
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,160
"No, he missed him.

618
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,620
He feels really bad.

619
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,800
A lady across the street called the police."

620
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,369
Doug came into the apartment, holding the
mask.

621
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:07,710
"I found this on the roof."

622
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,890
An agent looked closely at it.

623
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,400
"There's a hair inside it.

624
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,750
We'll test it.

625
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,720
It'll help us to find him."

626
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,589
Tobin walked across the room to Silvia.

627
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:23,010
"Who has a key to your apartment?"

628
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,350
"Nobody."

629
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,760
"And the door was locked.

630
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,280
Where do you keep your key?"

631
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,310
"In my purse," Silvia said.

632
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,810
"Have you had your purse with you all day?"

633
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,050
Tobin asked.

634
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,020
"Yes - no.

635
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:46,500
It was in my locker at the U.N." She was shaking.

636
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,250
"So, you're sitting here having a nice quiet
evening at home.

637
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:56,100
Then a man in a mask waves to you from the
fire escape."

638
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,480
"Yes."

639
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,490
Silvia almost smiled.

640
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,800
"That's what happened."

641
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,589
Tobin turned to Dot.

642
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:09,930
"I want somebody to look at her locker.

643
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,040
Look for fingerprints.

644
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,240
I'm taking her out for an hour."

645
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,760
They went to a bar and sat at a back table.

646
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,450
A waitress brought them two beers, and Tobin
looked at a photo of the mask.

647
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,839
"Is this a special mask?"

648
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:29,859
Tobin asked.

649
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:32,740
"A war mask?"

650
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,420
"No," Silvia replied.

651
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,290
"It's a mask of peace.

652
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,210
It was a gift."

653
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,420
Tobin looked more closely at the photo.

654
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,609
"What are those words inside it?"

655
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:53,700
"They say: 'I promise,'" Silvia said slowly.

656
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,930
She was silent for a minute, then she continued.

657
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:00,240
"I'll be honest with you.

658
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,000
My brother gave it to me.

659
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,660
I still have a brother, Simon, in Matobo."

660
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,690
"What was the promise?"

661
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,350
"I don't know.

662
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,540
I didn't ask him.

663
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,980
We...

664
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,040
we haven't spoken for a long time."

665
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,200
"What does your brother believe in?"

666
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,200
Tobin asked.

667
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:30,240
"Does he hold a gun, or does he believe in
peace too?"

668
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,790
Silvia thought about her brother and smiled.

669
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:37,329
"He believes in lists.

670
00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:41,370
When we were children, we lived on a farm.

671
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,600
We were often bored.

672
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,440
I read - and fought with my brother.

673
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,290
He kept lists of strange facts in cheap notebooks.

674
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:55,650
He had one notebook for his favorite words.

675
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:00,150
That's probably how I became interested in
words."

676
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,940
"Is he part of all this?"

677
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,940
Tobin asked.

678
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,940
"Why did the killers only try to scare you
tonight?

679
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,230
Why didn't they kill you?

680
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,720
If you can recognize the voice-"

681
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,530
She looked at him sadly.

682
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:19,130
"You don't believe anything I say.

683
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:25,000
We're standing on opposite sides of the river,
aren't we?"

684
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,210
she said.

685
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:32,660
"Give me a reason to get to the other side,"
Tobin said.

686
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,109
They finished their beers and Tobin took her
back to the apartment.

687
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:41,040
The agents and police officers were gone.

688
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,620
Silvia stood at the door while Tobin checked
the rooms, the closets, and the fire escape.

689
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,619
"OK, come in," he said.

690
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:52,960
"There's a police car outside.

691
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,440
They'll watch you until tomorrow morning."

692
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,380
"And then?"

693
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,950
Silvia asked.

694
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,859
"I don't know.

695
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:05,540
I'll think of something."

696
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,390
"Thank you."

697
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,790
Her voice was very sad.

698
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:14,210
Tobin moved toward the door, then he stopped.

699
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:18,710
"My wife was killed," he said.

700
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,400
He didn't turn around or look at her.

701
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,760
"Two weeks ago.

702
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,730
She... she left me and went away with another
man.

703
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,180
She was coming back...

704
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,630
She was a dancer.

705
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:37,680
Eddie was a dancer, too.

706
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,000
He was a great dancer but a bad driver.

707
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,450
He drove into a bridge outside Santa Fe on
the way to the airport."

708
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:54,880
Tobin stopped, and then he said, "So I can't
take her back this time."

709
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,700
He turned and looked at Silvia.

710
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,780
"I'm happy that Eddie's dead.

711
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:06,190
I wanted to kill him.

712
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,190
That's not very Ku."

713
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:10,839
He looked around the room.

714
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:14,470
"If you need anything, go downstairs.

715
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,760
Or call the police.

716
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,130
Or call me."

717
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:23,380
He wrote his cell phone number on a card.

718
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:28,300
Doug and Dot were waiting outside the apartment
building.

719
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:34,089
"We found an empty apartment on the opposite
side of the street," Dot said.

720
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:36,260
"We can watch her from there."

721
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:40,180
"Mo and I will watch her tonight," Doug said.

722
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,840
"Lewis and King are with Kuman-Kuman."

723
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,820
"OK," Tobin said.

724
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,820
"I'm going home.

725
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,140
Call me if there's a problem."

726
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:57,700
Later that night, the well-dressed African
quietly opened the door of a small, dirty

727
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:02,380
apartment in the Crown Heights area of New
York.

728
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,180
Another African man was sleeping on the bed.

729
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,210
The well-dressed African shook him awake.

730
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:11,260
"Hello, Jamal.

731
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,369
Where's the mask?" he asked.

732
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:19,490
"It fell," the other man said.

733
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:20,690
He was scared.

734
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:22,490
"I was running.

735
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:27,170
I didn't leave any fingerprints - I was wearing
gloves."

736
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,980
"On your head'?

737
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:38,220
Did you leave any hair in the mask?" the well-dressed
African shouted angrily.

738
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,680
He hit Jamal hard.

739
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:49,490
Then he pushed his face down into the bedclothes
until Jamal stopped moving.

740
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,810
Five minutes later, he left the apartment.

741
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:56,740
He climbed into a large black car.

742
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:04,119
Nils Lud and Marcus Matu were sitting in the
back seat.

743
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:09,380
CHAPTER SIX
The Search for the Cleaner

744
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:14,480
The following morning, Tobin met Rory Rudd
in the U.N. building.

745
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,350
"The door of her locker was clean," Rory said.

746
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:21,880
"There were no fingerprints on it.

747
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,650
Somebody had a key, used it, and then cleaned
the locker.

748
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,030
We're looking for a cleaner."

749
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,790
"Or another interpreter," Tobin said.

750
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,050
He called Doug.

751
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:41,109
"Go down to the interpreters' restroom and
talk to the cleaner," he ordered.

752
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:43,740
"Take somebody with you.

753
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,630
Find out about that locker."

754
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:53,089
An hour later, Doug and another agent, Russell,
were trying to talk to the cleaner.

755
00:48:53,089 --> 00:48:57,589
"Did you clean around these lockers yesterday?"

756
00:48:57,589 --> 00:48:58,589
Russell asked.

757
00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:05,320
The Portuguese cleaner didn't understand the
question, so Russell asked him again.

758
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,270
The cleaner shook his head.

759
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:17,270
"I wasn't working," he said slowly "Yesterday
Jamal worked for me."

760
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,240
Russell looked at his papers.

761
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,890
"Jad Jamal," he said.

762
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:25,740
"He lives in crown Heights."

763
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:32,810
The two men left the U.N. Soon they were in
Crown Heights, running up the stairs to Jamal's

764
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,310
apartment.

765
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:37,830
They knocked loudly on the door.

766
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:43,819
The well-dressed African opened the door and
looked calmly at the two agents.

767
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:49,450
He wasn't wearing a jacket and he was holding
a towel in his hand.

768
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,210
Doug showed his security card.

769
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:54,610
"Secret Service," he said.

770
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:58,359
"We want to talk with Mr. Jamal."

771
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:01,540
The well-dressed African smiled and shook
his head.

772
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:07,560
"He doesn't understand English," Russell said
to Doug.

773
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,380
Doug tried again.

774
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,790
He showed Jamal's picture to the African.

775
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:16,090
"Does this guy live here?"

776
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:20,480
"No... not here..." the African said.

777
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,109
He opened the door.

778
00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:25,660
"You want to see?"

779
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,849
Doug gave him a card.

780
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:31,310
"Tell him to call this number.

781
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,830
Soon."

782
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:37,070
The agents ran down the stairs and out of
the building.

783
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:43,650
The well-dressed African smiled again, closed
the apartment door, and threw the card onto

784
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,619
the floor.

785
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:52,370
Back at the U.N. building, Silvia was upstairs
in the interpreters' lunch room.

786
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:56,470
She picked up a newspaper and looked at the
front page.

787
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:03,850
There was a story about Kuman-Kuman in New
York: "Kuman-Kuman - a man of the people who

788
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:06,900
now takes the bus."

789
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,360
Suddenly, Silvia had a plan.

790
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:14,410
She threw down the newspaper and ran to the
door.

791
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:20,030
When she reached the doors to the U.N. building,
a woman stepped out in front of her.

792
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:22,410
"Ms. Broome."

793
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,440
Silvia turned, surprised.

794
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,410
"I'll take you home," Dot said.

795
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:34,810
As they climbed into the back of a Secret
Service car, they didn't notice a man watching

796
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:35,850
them.

797
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:39,470
He was unshaven, and his eyes were red with
tiredness.

798
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:43,460
His long, dark hair was dirty.

799
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:48,230
"Tobin is sometimes difficult," Dot said.

800
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,640
"I'm sorry.

801
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,920
He's having a bad time."

802
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,940
Silvia didn't answer.

803
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,940
She was looking out the car window.

804
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,500
"He... lost his wife."

805
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,790
"Did you know her?"

806
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,050
Silvia asked.

807
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:09,410
"She was a dancer."

808
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,579
"Are you in love with him?"

809
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:14,380
Silvia asked.

810
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,839
Dot turned quickly and looked at Silvia.

811
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:25,599
There was a long silence, then she said, "Sometimes."

812
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,760
The car stopped at Silvia's apartment and
she got out.

813
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,790
She smiled at Dot, then ran up the steps into
the building.

814
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:40,589
A few minutes later, she was sitting at her
desk when the phone rang.

815
00:52:40,589 --> 00:52:48,220
In the apartment across the street, Dot listened
to the call with Agents Lewis and King.

816
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,099
"Hello?"

817
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:51,099
Silvia said.

818
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:55,660
"Silvia, it's me - Philippe."

819
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:00,329
They spoke quickly in French, then Silvia
put down the phone.

820
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:03,810
She picked up her coat and left the apartment.

821
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:08,530
"I'll follow her," King said.

822
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:12,510
Silvia ran into the street and climbed onto
her motorcycle.

823
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,630
King got into his car.

824
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:19,839
There was a lot of traffic, but Silvia moved
quickly through it.

825
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,040
King couldn't follow her.

826
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,500
He called Dot.

827
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:28,100
"I lost her," he said angrily.

828
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:34,300
He drove through the streets - and then he
saw her.

829
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:39,450
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Cameraman

830
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:44,380
Silvia met Philippe in a park on the east
side of the city.

831
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,730
He kissed her and they sat down on a wooden
seat.

832
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:53,110
She looked at his long, dirty hair and his
tired eyes.

833
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:56,450
"Is Simon part of this?"

834
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:57,450
Silvia asked.

835
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,900
"Are you part of it?

836
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,630
Why are you here?"

837
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:04,550
Philippe looked at her.

838
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,810
His silence scared her.

839
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:12,119
"I've done something terrible," he said in
English.

840
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:15,950
"Somebody called me - one of Kuman's people.

841
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:19,700
I thought it was one of Kuman's people.

842
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,390
He wanted to organize a meeting with Xola.

843
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,590
'We have to work together,' he said.

844
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:29,700
'It's the only way we can fight Zuwanie.'"

845
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,109
"What happened?"

846
00:54:32,109 --> 00:54:34,050
Silvia asked.

847
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,050
He took her hands.

848
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:36,730
"I told Xola.

849
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,540
I was excited.

850
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:43,470
I thought that it was the end of the fight
between them.

851
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,700
But we were tricked.

852
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,140
Xola's dead."

853
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,700
Silvia tried to pull her hands away.

854
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,050
"I knew he was dead," she whispered.

855
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,750
"I felt it.

856
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,280
Who was with him?"

857
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,290
Philippe shook his head and looked away from
her, across the park.

858
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:10,089
"No, Simon wasn't there.

859
00:55:10,089 --> 00:55:11,109
Just Xola.

860
00:55:11,109 --> 00:55:13,780
I stayed in the car.

861
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,349
Nobody came back out."

862
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:18,440
"Where's my brother?"

863
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,640
Silvia asked.

864
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,630
"I don't know," Philippe said.

865
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:24,430
"He's hiding somewhere.

866
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:26,609
I don't think they have him."

867
00:55:26,609 --> 00:55:28,369
"Have him?

868
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:31,140
You think Kuman has Simon?"

869
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,970
"I don't know.

870
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:34,800
It's all crazy.

871
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,860
We try to stop the fighting, but we can't.

872
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:43,559
People see my photos in the newspaper and
turn the page.

873
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:46,349
You were smart to leave the country."

874
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:50,930
"I can't forget completely," Silvia said.

875
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,119
"Simon is still there.

876
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,859
I have to find him.

877
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:59,119
I have to know he's OK."

878
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,160
Philippe was almost crying now.

879
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,920
"Do you understand what I did?

880
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,809
I took Xola to them," he said.

881
00:56:08,809 --> 00:56:12,330
"You didn't know," Silvia said.

882
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,630
"I have to go.

883
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,780
I'm sorry.

884
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,579
I tried to help..."

885
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:26,640
"You didn't kill Xola," Silvia shouted, as
he walked away.

886
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,210
King watched Philippe leave the park.

887
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:35,099
He followed him to the Chelsea Hotel, then
he called Ostroff.

888
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:39,250
"Stay with him," he said.

889
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:45,760
As Silvia got off her motorcycle outside her
apartment building, Tobin ran up to her.

890
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,710
"You can't disappear!

891
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:52,710
You have to tell me where you're going," he
said angrily.

892
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,350
"How can I protect you?"

893
00:56:55,350 --> 00:57:00,359
"That's not your job," Silvia said.

894
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:01,809
"Remember?"

895
00:57:01,809 --> 00:57:09,460
"It's different now, since the man in the
mask," Tobin said Jowly.

896
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:14,300
"We're watching you from an apartment across
the street.

897
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,820
Who was the man in the park?"

898
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:21,640
"It's personal," Silvia said quickly.

899
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,640
"No.

900
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,030
No, I need to know.

901
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:27,880
What's his name?"

902
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:34,099
"It's not your business," Silvia said, and
started to walk away.

903
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:37,320
"We have your phone records.

904
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,220
You called someone," Tobin aid.

905
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,540
Silvia stopped.

906
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,560
"You called him, didn't you?

907
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,880
The night before you went to Chief Wu.

908
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,220
Before you told us about the voice in the
hall.

909
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,760
Why?

910
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:59,119
Is he part of the plan to kill Zuwanie?"

911
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,270
Silvia looked worried.

912
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:02,400
Tobin continued.

913
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,190
"Was that him?

914
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,190
Here?

915
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:07,190
Now?

916
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,369
In my country?

917
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:10,390
This is my business."

918
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:15,210
"You're wrong," Silvia said.

919
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:19,089
"It's not your business."

920
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:23,330
Then she turned away from him and ran up to
the apartment.

921
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:28,099
She locked the door and walked into the living
room.

922
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:31,010
There was an old wooden box on the table.

923
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:39,609
She opened it and took out some photos: Silvia
on the farm, age 15; Silvia and Simon in front

924
00:58:39,609 --> 00:58:47,910
of a fire; Silvia, Simon, and Xola in a cafe
in Paris.

925
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:52,319
It was late, but Silvia couldn't sleep.

926
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,410
She turned on the TV and watched the news.

927
00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:02,650
There were pictures of Zuwanie in Africa and
of the protesters outside the U.N. building.

928
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:07,630
"Is Dr. Zuwanie in danger during his visit
to New York?"

929
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,070
the reporter asked.

930
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:16,420
"As we can see, the police are closing the
roads to the airport."

931
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,180
Kuman-Kuman was interviewed.

932
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:25,250
"How is a madman able to speak at the United
Nations?" he asked angrily.

933
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:30,460
"He'll lie about changes that he's never going
to make.

934
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:35,680
Zuwanie wants to stay in Matobo as president.

935
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:40,670
People only have to think that someone is
trying to kill him.

936
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:44,990
That's enough to make him stronger."

937
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:50,180
Dot sat in the apartment across the street
and watched Silvia through the window.

938
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:54,550
The apartment door opened, and Tobin came
in.

939
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:56,980
He was carrying a bag.

940
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:00,760
"She can't sleep," Dot said.

941
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,530
"She just turned the TV on."

942
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:05,990
She picked up her purse.

943
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:09,140
"Where are you going?"

944
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,820
Tobin asked.

945
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,440
"Home.

946
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:17,090
You're here with your bag, so I can go now."

947
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,010
She put her hand on his shoulder.

948
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:23,710
"I'll see you in the morning."

949
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:26,870
Tobin watched the news program on TV.

950
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,859
Suddenly, his cell phone rang.

951
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,260
"Keller," he said.

952
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:35,450
"I'm sorry," Silvia said.

953
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:39,190
"I didn't know you were watching me earlier."

954
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:43,410
"Tell me what happened," Tobin said.

955
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:47,650
"I had to meet someone."

956
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:50,339
Tobin looked at the photos on the desk.

957
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:53,170
They showed Silvia and the man in the park.

958
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:56,319
"Philippe Broullet," he said.

959
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,640
"He takes photos for a French newspaper."

960
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,270
"He wanted to talk to me."

961
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:08,780
"And now you're watching TV because you can't
sleep," Tobin said.

962
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:13,420
"What did he say to you?"

963
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,099
Silvia looked at the window.

964
01:01:15,099 --> 01:01:18,730
"How do you know...?

965
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,270
Are you across the street?"

966
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:24,540
She moved to the window and saw him.

967
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:29,839
"Philippe told me..." she said softly.

968
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:32,940
"We lost a friend.

969
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,040
He lost a friend.

970
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:40,420
I lost somebody that I loved a long time ago.

971
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:44,630
I spend a lot of time trying to remember Africa.

972
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:48,750
Now it's everywhere."

973
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:56,559
She was silent for a minute, and then she
continued, "Why am I calling you?

974
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,720
What do you do when you can't sleep?"

975
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:04,440
"I stay awake," Tobin said.

976
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,350
He heard her laugh.

977
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:11,549
"You don't name the dead," he continued.

978
01:02:11,549 --> 01:02:13,290
"Why?

979
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:15,060
What happens?"

980
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:20,930
"You move past them," Silvia said softly.

981
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:24,990
"You leave them behind.

982
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:27,580
You're having a hard time..."

983
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,650
"Yes," Tobin said.

984
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:33,859
"And I know you are, too."

985
01:02:33,859 --> 01:02:40,750
They were both silent, then Silvia said, "Will
you be there until the morning?"

986
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:43,270
"Yes, I'll be here."

987
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:48,720
"I'll try to fall asleep while we're on the
phone.

988
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,410
Is that OK?"

989
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:53,700
"That's fine," Tobin said.

990
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,099
He watched her through the window.

991
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:58,950
She went into the bedroom and lay down.

992
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:02,420
The phone was still in her hand.

993
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:09,900
It was quiet for a long time, then she whispered,
"Goodnight."

994
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:20,790
"Goodnight," Tobin said into the phone.

995
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:26,410
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Bomb on the Bus

996
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:31,400
Next morning, Silvia left her apartment and
walked down the street.

997
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,930
King sat in his car and watched her.

998
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:41,290
"Please don't take the motorcycle," he said
to himself.

999
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:48,630
She walked past the bike to King's car, opened
the back door, and got in.

1000
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:52,710
"You can drive me," she said calmly.

1001
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:58,079
They drove silently through the New York streets
toward Brooklyn.

1002
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:03,190
Suddenly, Silvia said, "I'll get out here."

1003
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:05,770
King stopped the car.

1004
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:10,750
After Silvia climbed out, he called Tobin
on his cell phone.

1005
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:15,109
Tobin was in the Secret Service offices with
Russell and Dot.

1006
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:19,490
"She's where?" he said.

1007
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:22,710
King told him the name of the street.

1008
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:25,660
"Kuman-Kuman lives near there!"

1009
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:26,660
Tobin said.

1010
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:30,470
"Stay in your car, but follow her."

1011
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:32,069
He turned to Russell.

1012
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:35,020
"What happened?" he asked.

1013
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:41,329
"Jad Jamal was working in the interpreters'
locker room," Russell said, "on the day that

1014
01:04:41,329 --> 01:04:44,359
the man in the mask climbed the fire escape."

1015
01:04:44,359 --> 01:04:48,490
"Bring him to me," Tobin said.

1016
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,550
"We can't find him.

1017
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:54,460
He wasn't home yesterday, and he didn't come
to work this morning."

1018
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:59,960
"Go back to his apartment," Tobin said angrily.

1019
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:04,170
"Doug's already there," Russell said.

1020
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:07,490
He was looking at the pictures on Tobin's
desk.

1021
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:10,750
"Hey!" he said, suddenly excited.

1022
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:14,819
"This guy lives with Jamal."

1023
01:05:14,819 --> 01:05:24,750
He picked up a picture and read the name on
the back: "Jean Gamba, Gabon, Africa."

1024
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:29,740
Jean Gamba was in the Crown Heights apartment.

1025
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:34,730
He smoothed down his sharp suit and straightened
his tie.

1026
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:42,000
He threw some papers on the floor, picked
up a big bag, and left the room.

1027
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,069
Doug was sitting outside the apartment.

1028
01:05:45,069 --> 01:05:47,079
He called Russell.

1029
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:51,450
"Jamal's friend left the building."

1030
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:53,660
Tobin took Russell's phone.

1031
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:58,020
"Stay with him," he said to Doug.

1032
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,810
He put down the phone and turned to Dot.

1033
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:06,080
"We're going to Crown Heights," he said.

1034
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,619
Tobin and Dot drove quickly through the city.

1035
01:06:09,619 --> 01:06:14,560
They took out their guns and went slowly into
Jamal's apartment.

1036
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,770
Dot opened the kitchen door.

1037
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:18,579
"In here!"

1038
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:21,299
she called to Tobin.

1039
01:06:21,299 --> 01:06:26,869
There were boxes, bottles, and a lot of black
plastic on the kitchen table.

1040
01:06:26,869 --> 01:06:31,299
The room was a bomb factory.

1041
01:06:31,299 --> 01:06:34,780
Dot went into the bedroom, but it was empty.

1042
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:38,320
Then she saw that the closet door was open.

1043
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:44,190
She moved closer - and found Jad Jamal's body.

1044
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:45,690
"Keller!"

1045
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:47,849
she shouted.

1046
01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:51,859
He didn't reply, so she went back into the
kitchen.

1047
01:06:51,859 --> 01:06:56,450
"We have a dead body in the closet," she told
him.

1048
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:58,500
"I'll call for help.

1049
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:02,980
It's very dark in here - how can you see?"

1050
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,630
She moved toward the light switch.

1051
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:10,660
"Wait!" Tobin cried, his eyes on the light
above them.

1052
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:14,510
Her hand stopped and she looked up.

1053
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:18,109
The light was covered with black plastic.

1054
01:07:18,109 --> 01:07:20,369
It was another bomb!

1055
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:26,980
Slowly, Tobin and Dot moved out of the kitchen
and down the stairs.

1056
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:31,290
At the same time, Doug was following Gamba.

1057
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:35,710
At the subway station, both men got on a train.

1058
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:38,940
Gamba held his bag on his knees.

1059
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:42,440
When the subway train stopped, Gamba got off.

1060
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,810
Doug waited for a second and then followed.

1061
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:51,230
They walked up the stairs onto the Brooklyn
streets.

1062
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:56,320
Gamba walked to the bus stop and got in line.

1063
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:02,400
A few hundred meters away, Mohammad was watching
Kuman-Kuman's apartment.

1064
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:08,510
He saw the rebel leader leave his building
and walk down the street with his guards.

1065
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:14,250
The African said hello to a neighbor and gave
some money to a homeless prison.

1066
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:19,639
Suddenly, Mohammad saw Silvia standing at
a bus stop.

1067
01:08:19,639 --> 01:08:22,520
Why was she there?

1068
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,349
He looked down the street and saw King's car.

1069
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:31,310
What was happening?

1070
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:34,139
Kuman-Kuman walked toward the bus stop.

1071
01:08:34,139 --> 01:08:37,789
He and his men stopped next to Silvia.

1072
01:08:37,789 --> 01:08:42,229
When the bus arrived, one of Kuman's men stepped
in front of her.

1073
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:45,469
"There's a line!"

1074
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:49,099
Silvia said angrily in Ku.

1075
01:08:49,099 --> 01:08:51,710
Kuman heard her and smiled.

1076
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,239
He followed her onto the bus.

1077
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:59,209
Mohammad ran to the bus and jumped on, too.

1078
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:03,589
King picked up his radio and spoke urgently
to Tobin.

1079
01:09:03,589 --> 01:09:07,389
"She just got on the bus with Kuman."

1080
01:09:07,389 --> 01:09:09,919
"What's she doing?"

1081
01:09:09,919 --> 01:09:12,039
Tobin shouted.

1082
01:09:12,039 --> 01:09:18,569
Silvia found a seat and sat down, and Kuman
sat across from her.

1083
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:21,539
His men looked nervously at them.

1084
01:09:21,539 --> 01:09:25,389
"Did you speak Ku?

1085
01:09:25,389 --> 01:09:28,139
My language from home?"

1086
01:09:28,139 --> 01:09:31,150
"Yes," Silvia replied.

1087
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:33,609
"I'm Matoban."

1088
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:37,750
He gave her the smile of a man who liked pretty
women.

1089
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:42,329
"Do you know who I am?" he asked.

1090
01:09:42,329 --> 01:09:46,270
"Yes - you're a killer.

1091
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:52,219
You ordered the murder of Ajene Xola," Silvia
said angrily.

1092
01:09:52,219 --> 01:09:56,679
The other men moved closer, but Kuman held
up his hand.

1093
01:09:56,679 --> 01:09:59,429
"Who told you this?"

1094
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:01,670
Kuman said.

1095
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:04,429
"Where's my brother?"

1096
01:10:04,429 --> 01:10:05,679
Silvia asked.

1097
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:07,309
"Your brother?"

1098
01:10:07,309 --> 01:10:08,929
Kuman said.

1099
01:10:08,929 --> 01:10:11,429
"Who is your brother?

1100
01:10:11,429 --> 01:10:14,289
I don't know who you are.

1101
01:10:14,289 --> 01:10:18,000
You're very brave - or crazy."

1102
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,030
"You wanted a meeting with Xola.

1103
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:25,639
Your people called Philippe Broullet.

1104
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:27,209
You know him."

1105
01:10:27,209 --> 01:10:31,000
"I don't," Kuman said.

1106
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:37,199
"So someone wants you to believe that I killed
Xola?

1107
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,400
You are wrong.

1108
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:44,300
You should believe me, Miss Matoban."

1109
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,579
"Why?"

1110
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:47,260
Silvia asked.

1111
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:51,590
"Because I want to work with Xola.

1112
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:56,729
We cannot win alone, but we can win together.

1113
01:10:56,729 --> 01:10:59,010
He has people who can fight.

1114
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:01,440
I have money.

1115
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,659
I wanted a meeting, but I didn't ask for one.

1116
01:11:05,659 --> 01:11:13,929
If Xola is dead, that's bad news for everyone."

1117
01:11:13,929 --> 01:11:16,349
The bus slowed and stopped.

1118
01:11:16,349 --> 01:11:23,789
Jean Gamba climbed on, found a seat behind
an old lady, and sat down.

1119
01:11:23,789 --> 01:11:31,400
He opened his bag, took out a small lunch
box, and put it on the floor under his seat.

1120
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,000
Doug sat down a few seats behind Gamba.

1121
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,070
He saw Silvia, but she didn't see him.

1122
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:41,900
He recognized Mohammad and turned away.

1123
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:45,999
Then he pulled out his phone and called Tobin.

1124
01:11:45,999 --> 01:11:49,670
"We have a problem," Doug said.

1125
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:53,539
"Gamba and I just got on the 33 bus.

1126
01:11:53,539 --> 01:11:54,590
With Mohammad.

1127
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:56,580
And Silvia Broome.

1128
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,840
And Kuman- Kuman."

1129
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:02,059
"You're all on the same bus?"

1130
01:12:02,059 --> 01:12:05,139
Tobin said in surprise.

1131
01:12:05,139 --> 01:12:06,169
"Yes."

1132
01:12:06,169 --> 01:12:07,519
Suddenly, Tobin understood.

1133
01:12:07,519 --> 01:12:11,619
The bomb factory!

1134
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:16,729
Gamba was on the bus with Kuman-Kuman - and
he had a bomb!

1135
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:20,400
"You and Mohammad, get off.

1136
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,809
And get Ms. Broome off too.

1137
01:12:22,809 --> 01:12:24,019
Now!"

1138
01:12:24,019 --> 01:12:27,659
"We can't do that," Doug said.

1139
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:29,440
"We're moving."

1140
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,420
"Is Gamba carrying anything?"

1141
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,420
Tobin asked.

1142
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:34,510
"A bag.

1143
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:36,579
It's on his knee."

1144
01:12:36,579 --> 01:12:38,719
"Can you get to him?"

1145
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:39,719
Tobin asked.

1146
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:43,800
"No, he'll see us," Doug said.

1147
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,949
The bus slowed down.

1148
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:48,650
"We're stopping."

1149
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:53,889
At the back of the bus, Kuman-Kuman was still
talking to Silvia.

1150
01:12:53,889 --> 01:12:59,869
'What do you do here - so far from home?"
he asked.

1151
01:12:59,869 --> 01:13:05,590
"I work and I hope," Silvia replied.

1152
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:08,989
"Like me," Kuman said.

1153
01:13:08,989 --> 01:13:13,489
"I don't think so," Silvia said angrily.

1154
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:16,729
"Where do you work?"

1155
01:13:16,729 --> 01:13:20,120
"I'm an interpreter at the U.N."

1156
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:24,579
"The U.N. is full of words.

1157
01:13:24,579 --> 01:13:28,360
They mean nothing," Kuman said.

1158
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:31,800
"You want more war?"

1159
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,260
Silvia asked.

1160
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:37,810
"I want more business," Kuman said.

1161
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:41,300
"Countries aren't important now.

1162
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,590
Only companies, international companies."

1163
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:50,349
"I think you're wrong," Silvia said.

1164
01:13:50,349 --> 01:13:52,269
Kuman smiled.

1165
01:13:52,269 --> 01:13:56,260
"You're still young," he said.

1166
01:13:56,260 --> 01:14:00,420
"What's your brother's name?"

1167
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,459
"Simon.

1168
01:14:01,459 --> 01:14:03,539
Simon Broome."

1169
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:06,659
"You're very brave.

1170
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:10,729
I'll ask my people to find out about him."

1171
01:14:10,729 --> 01:14:13,459
"Thank you."

1172
01:14:13,459 --> 01:14:17,459
Silvia stood up and moved toward the door
of the bus.

1173
01:14:17,459 --> 01:14:19,010
She was shaking.

1174
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:25,560
King, in his car behind the bus, saw Silvia
climb down the steps.

1175
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,150
He used his radio to call Dot.

1176
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:32,110
Tobin was still talking on the phone to Doug.

1177
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:35,489
"What's happening?" he asked.

1178
01:14:35,489 --> 01:14:40,099
"We stopped," Doug said quietly into his cell
phone.

1179
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:42,130
"She's getting off.

1180
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:44,380
Gamba is, too..."

1181
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,239
"Is he carrying the bag?"

1182
01:14:47,239 --> 01:14:49,190
Tobin asked.

1183
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:53,659
Doug couldn't answer because Gamba was looking
straight at him.

1184
01:14:53,659 --> 01:14:58,150
Then Gamba moved past Kuman-Kuman and off
the bus.

1185
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:01,880
"He's off the bus," Doug said.

1186
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,480
"But I think he recognized me."

1187
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,729
Mohammad stood up and followed Gamba.

1188
01:15:07,729 --> 01:15:14,650
I've got him," he said quietly, as he walked
past Doug.

1189
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:18,439
Mohammad is off the bus," Doug told Tobin.

1190
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:22,219
"He's following Gamba and King is watching
Ms. Broome.

1191
01:15:22,219 --> 01:15:25,119
I'll stay with Kuman."

1192
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:27,690
Doug closed his cell phone.

1193
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:31,309
"Get off the bus now!"

1194
01:15:31,309 --> 01:15:36,229
Tobin shouted, but he was too late.

1195
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:40,769
An old woman opened the bus window and shouted,
"Sir!

1196
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:42,419
Excuse me!

1197
01:15:42,419 --> 01:15:45,699
You forgot your lunch."

1198
01:15:45,699 --> 01:15:50,000
She pointed at the lunch box under the seat.

1199
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,079
Doug looked out the window and watched Gamba
walk away.

1200
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:56,739
Suddenly, he knew...

1201
01:15:56,739 --> 01:15:59,239
"Oh, no!" he thought.

1202
01:15:59,239 --> 01:16:05,689
There was a terrible noise, then a ball of
fire.

1203
01:16:05,689 --> 01:16:11,889
In the street, Mohammad and Silvia fell to
the ground.

1204
01:16:11,889 --> 01:16:17,800
CHAPTER NINE
Silvia's History

1205
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:22,669
Tobin and Dot drove quickly across town to
the burning bus.

1206
01:16:22,669 --> 01:16:26,749
The air smelled of smoke and death.

1207
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:29,639
They saw bodies under sheets.

1208
01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:35,389
The windows in King's car were broken and
a doctor was helping him.

1209
01:16:35,389 --> 01:16:41,030
Mohammad was sitting on the sidewalk, and
Dot walked toward him.

1210
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:45,289
There was no sign of Doug.

1211
01:16:45,289 --> 01:16:49,219
Silvia and a doctor were helping a small child.

1212
01:16:49,219 --> 01:16:52,229
His mother lay unmoving on the ground.

1213
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:58,989
As Silvia looked up, Tobin saw blood on her
face and arms.

1214
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:04,539
She saw him, then turned back to the child.

1215
01:17:04,539 --> 01:17:08,480
An hour later, Tobin took Silvia home.

1216
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:13,340
For a long time she was silent, then she spoke.

1217
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:20,869
"When I was a child, the driver on the school
bus carried a gun.

1218
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:22,769
It scared me.

1219
01:17:22,769 --> 01:17:27,610
That was sixteen thousand kilometers away.

1220
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:29,900
Now..."

1221
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,829
She shook her head.

1222
01:17:32,829 --> 01:17:37,989
Tobin stopped the car outside her apartment
and they both got out.

1223
01:17:37,989 --> 01:17:41,860
Silvia turned to him.

1224
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:44,979
"Thanks for bringing me home," she said.

1225
01:17:44,979 --> 01:17:47,369
She opened the door to her building.

1226
01:17:47,369 --> 01:17:51,030
"Why were you on the bus?"

1227
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:52,489
Tobin asked.

1228
01:17:52,489 --> 01:17:55,940
"Can we talk later?"

1229
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:57,130
Silvia said.

1230
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:58,230
"No!"

1231
01:17:58,230 --> 01:17:59,539
Tobin replied angrily.

1232
01:17:59,539 --> 01:18:02,280
"I lost a man today.

1233
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,729
He was very young, only a kid.

1234
01:18:05,729 --> 01:18:10,059
We're going to talk now."

1235
01:18:10,059 --> 01:18:14,289
Silvia tried to close the door, but he stopped
her.

1236
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:17,270
He followed up the stairs into her apartment.

1237
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:21,939
"How do you know Kuman?" he asked.

1238
01:18:21,939 --> 01:18:24,900
"I don't," Silvia protested.

1239
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,550
"I never met him before -"

1240
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:29,659
"You're lying to me again!"

1241
01:18:29,659 --> 01:18:32,599
"I'm not lying.

1242
01:18:32,599 --> 01:18:35,539
I wanted him to help me."

1243
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:38,429
"With what?"

1244
01:18:38,429 --> 01:18:40,010
Silvia shook her head.

1245
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:43,480
"I can't tell you.

1246
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:46,039
Someone will get hurt."

1247
01:18:46,039 --> 01:18:49,189
"Why did you leave Africa?"

1248
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:50,270
Tobin shouted.

1249
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:51,809
"I told you -"

1250
01:18:51,809 --> 01:18:54,959
"Why did you come here?"

1251
01:18:54,959 --> 01:18:58,039
"Stop shouting at me!"

1252
01:18:58,039 --> 01:18:59,300
Silvia said.

1253
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,209
"Stop lying to me!"

1254
01:19:02,209 --> 01:19:03,539
Tobin said.

1255
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:08,229
"I was on a bus that was destroyed.

1256
01:19:08,229 --> 01:19:11,849
I can't think while you're shouting!"

1257
01:19:11,849 --> 01:19:17,659
She sat down and put her head in her hands.

1258
01:19:17,659 --> 01:19:23,880
Tobin took two pieces of paper from his jacket
pocket and look at them in front of Silvia.

1259
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:29,570
There was a list of names on the first piece
of paper, the names of people in an African

1260
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:33,769
rebel group called the AFP.

1261
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:40,300
The second piece of paper was a photo that
showed Silvia with a young white man.

1262
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:46,199
They were walking down the road in Africa
with a number of black rebels and they were

1263
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:49,429
all carrying rifles.

1264
01:19:49,429 --> 01:19:53,499
Suddenly, the room was very quiet.

1265
01:19:53,499 --> 01:19:59,389
"That isn't me," Silvia said slowly.

1266
01:19:59,389 --> 01:20:03,699
"Yes, it is."

1267
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:09,469
"It isn't me now."

1268
01:20:09,469 --> 01:20:13,699
She stopped for a minute, and then continued.

1269
01:20:13,699 --> 01:20:17,280
"Thousands of people died in Matobo.

1270
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:22,729
First, we protested peacefully and then we
used rifles.

1271
01:20:22,729 --> 01:20:28,079
We wanted people to listen - just listen.

1272
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:30,079
I killed a boy.

1273
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:34,489
He tried to kill me, so I shot him in the
head.

1274
01:20:34,489 --> 01:20:37,939
Then I gave that rifle..."

1275
01:20:37,939 --> 01:20:43,159
she pointed to the photo "... to my brother.

1276
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:45,079
'I can't do this,' I told him.

1277
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:46,769
But my brother didn't listen.

1278
01:20:46,769 --> 01:20:49,079
'Zuwanie's still here,' he said.

1279
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:52,539
'Our parents are dead and he's alive.

1280
01:20:52,539 --> 01:20:54,239
You can't stop.'

1281
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:58,820
He never spoke to me again.

1282
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:02,179
I write to him but he doesn't write to me.

1283
01:21:02,179 --> 01:21:06,959
I send him notebooks - I hope he gets them.

1284
01:21:06,959 --> 01:21:09,360
He doesn't want to know me."

1285
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:15,960
"I lied to you," Silvia continued, "because
I was afraid.

1286
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:20,889
I don't know if my brother is part of this
plan.

1287
01:21:20,889 --> 01:21:24,349
It's possible that he's trying to kill Zuwanie.

1288
01:21:24,349 --> 01:21:25,559
I don't know.

1289
01:21:25,559 --> 01:21:30,520
I lied to everyone to get a job here.

1290
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,059
The U.N. can change Matobo.

1291
01:21:33,059 --> 01:21:37,979
Words are slower and quieter than guns.

1292
01:21:37,979 --> 01:21:43,760
But they're the only way to stop the killing."

1293
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:49,090
Tobin looked at the photo of young Silvia
carrying her rifle, and then he looked at

1294
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:51,439
the woman next to him.

1295
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:55,149
He went into the bathroom and found a washcloth.

1296
01:21:55,149 --> 01:21:58,449
When he came back, he sat next to her.

1297
01:21:58,449 --> 01:22:02,630
He carefully washed the blood from her face.

1298
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:06,999
She touched his hand and looked into his eyes.

1299
01:22:06,999 --> 01:22:11,579
Slowly, she put her head on his shoulder.

1300
01:22:11,579 --> 01:22:17,599
Tobin didn't move for a long time, then he
put his arms around her.

1301
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:22,340
He watched her fall asleep.

1302
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:28,659
In the Matoban government offices on the other
side of town, Lud was watching the news on

1303
01:22:28,659 --> 01:22:29,659
television.

1304
01:22:29,659 --> 01:22:34,579
A reporter was talking about the bomb on the
bus.

1305
01:22:34,579 --> 01:22:41,229
There were two other men in the room: the
Ambassador's assistant, Matu, and the well-dressed

1306
01:22:41,229 --> 01:22:45,489
African, Jean Gamba.

1307
01:22:45,489 --> 01:22:50,070
"The interpreter was on the bus," Gamba said.

1308
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:53,199
"She was talking to Kuman."

1309
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:56,939
"Is she -?" Lud asked.

1310
01:22:56,939 --> 01:22:59,070
"She got off the bus.

1311
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:01,329
Before the bomb."

1312
01:23:01,329 --> 01:23:05,119
"What were they talking about?"

1313
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:06,119
Lud asked.

1314
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:10,749
"I don't know," Gamba replied.

1315
01:23:10,749 --> 01:23:15,050
"What did Kuman tell her?"

1316
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:18,780
Lud asked softly.

1317
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:24,469
CHAPTER TEN
Simon's Notebooks

1318
01:23:24,469 --> 01:23:29,539
The next morning, there were a lot more protesters
outside the U.N. building.

1319
01:23:29,539 --> 01:23:36,499
Opposite them, the Matoban Ambassador was
speaking to a large crowd of reporters.

1320
01:23:36,499 --> 01:23:40,380
Matu interpreted his words into English.

1321
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:48,209
"This is why Dr. Zuwanie must speak," the
Ambassador said.

1322
01:23:48,209 --> 01:23:53,429
The rebels are here in America and they want
to bring fear with the bombs.

1323
01:23:53,429 --> 01:24:02,340
This terrible attack on the bus is an attack
on the U.N.!"

1324
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:08,749
Silvia watched them for a few minutes and
then turned way.

1325
01:24:08,749 --> 01:24:15,860
Inside the U.N., Tobin, Dot, Wu, and Rory
were looking at pictures of Jean Gamba.

1326
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:20,919
We're searching everywhere for him," Tobin
said.

1327
01:24:20,919 --> 01:24:27,429
"He won't get into the U.N. building," Wu
said.

1328
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:33,219
"Maybe he's already gone and it's finished,"
Rory said.

1329
01:24:33,219 --> 01:24:36,909
But Wu and Tobin didn't believe him.

1330
01:24:36,909 --> 01:24:39,929
Suddenly, Dot's cell phone rang.

1331
01:24:39,929 --> 01:24:43,949
She listened, then turned to Tobin.

1332
01:24:43,949 --> 01:24:51,169
Fifteen minutes later, Tobin and Dot hurried
into the Chelsea hotel and met Ostroff outside

1333
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:52,690
one of the rooms.

1334
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:57,630
Inside, a police officer was taking photos.

1335
01:24:57,630 --> 01:25:04,099
There were cameras on the bed, and a note
and a bag on the desk.

1336
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:10,149
Tobin went into the bathroom where Philippe
was lying in the bath.

1337
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:14,639
The water was cold, and red with blood.

1338
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:20,619
Ostroff picked up the note on the desk and
gave it to Tobin.

1339
01:25:20,619 --> 01:25:24,119
It was addressed to Silvia.

1340
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:28,329
Tobin put the note in his pocket and left
the hotel.

1341
01:25:28,329 --> 01:25:33,969
He and Dot didn't speak as they drove back
to the U.N.

1342
01:25:33,969 --> 01:25:42,599
As Silvia came down the stairs into the U.N.
entrance hall, she saw Tobin near the door.

1343
01:25:42,599 --> 01:25:50,519
He was carrying a small bag and the look on
his face meant bad news.

1344
01:25:50,519 --> 01:25:56,349
Tobin took her outside and they sat down together.

1345
01:25:56,349 --> 01:25:58,209
Silvia closed her eyes.

1346
01:25:58,209 --> 01:26:01,679
"Is it Philippe?"

1347
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:04,010
she whispered.

1348
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:07,400
Tobin was silent, and she continued.

1349
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,380
"You can tell me."

1350
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:12,689
"Yes," Tobin said.

1351
01:26:12,689 --> 01:26:16,239
"He cut his wrists.

1352
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,239
Silvia -"

1353
01:26:17,239 --> 01:26:22,309
"I was unkind to him," Silvia said sadly.

1354
01:26:22,309 --> 01:26:27,059
"He was unhappy, and I shouted at him.

1355
01:26:27,059 --> 01:26:30,630
Did he leave a note?"

1356
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:32,219
"Yes," Tobin said.

1357
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:35,209
"Did you read it?"

1358
01:26:35,209 --> 01:26:36,810
Silvia asked.

1359
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:41,639
"Of course you did."

1360
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:46,310
Tobin took the note out of his jacket pocket
and handed it to her.

1361
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:47,659
She shook her head.

1362
01:26:47,659 --> 01:26:52,429
"Read it to me," she said.

1363
01:26:52,429 --> 01:26:56,260
"Dear Silvia," Tobin read.

1364
01:26:56,260 --> 01:27:01,590
"I couldn't find the words, so I lied to you.

1365
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:07,300
Simon was at the stadium with Xola and they
shot him, too.

1366
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:10,809
I was too scared to tell you.

1367
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:13,119
Simon was braver than me.

1368
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:16,590
You're braver than me.

1369
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:19,110
I'm so sorry...

1370
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:24,229
I'm so sorry."

1371
01:27:24,229 --> 01:27:25,380
Tobin looked up at Silvia.

1372
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:29,880
"He wrote, 'I'm so sorry' twice?"

1373
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,699
she asked quietly.

1374
01:27:32,699 --> 01:27:36,050
"No," Tobin said.

1375
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:37,670
"Once.

1376
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:40,690
The second time was me."

1377
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:42,650
She smiled sadly.

1378
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:47,559
"I don't know what to say," Tobin continued.

1379
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:54,579
"My friends didn't know what to say to me
after my wife's death.

1380
01:27:54,579 --> 01:27:56,139
Now I know how they felt."

1381
01:27:56,139 --> 01:28:01,960
"It's OK," Silvia whispered.

1382
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:04,340
"Yes," Tobin said.

1383
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:10,309
"I tell my friends it's OK too."

1384
01:28:10,309 --> 01:28:13,659
He picked up the bag and put it between them.

1385
01:28:13,659 --> 01:28:16,760
"This was with the note."

1386
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:22,239
He stood up slowly and walked away.

1387
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:23,919
Silvia opened the bag.

1388
01:28:23,919 --> 01:28:31,309
There were more than thirty notebooks inside
- her brother's notebooks.

1389
01:28:31,309 --> 01:28:33,429
She opened one of them.

1390
01:28:33,429 --> 01:28:41,409
It was full of lists, in the writing of a
child - lists of sports teams, science facts,

1391
01:28:41,409 --> 01:28:43,110
and countries.

1392
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:51,579
She recognized one of the newer notebooks
by its gray cover - a book that she sent him.

1393
01:28:51,579 --> 01:28:56,699
Inside was a list of names, hundreds of names.

1394
01:28:56,699 --> 01:29:00,300
"Ruth Vera, killed in a bus station...

1395
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,590
Charles Token, shot...

1396
01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:06,190
Thomas Vy, knifed to death...

1397
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:11,899
Robaire Mamu, murdered in a police station..."

1398
01:29:11,899 --> 01:29:20,770
She remembered Kuman-Kuman's words: "Zuwanie
wants to stay in Matobo as president.

1399
01:29:20,770 --> 01:29:26,269
People only have to think that someone is
trying to kill him.

1400
01:29:26,269 --> 01:29:31,729
That's enough to make him stronger."

1401
01:29:31,729 --> 01:29:37,439
She remembered her parents and her sister,
and the soldiers that killed them.

1402
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:40,880
She heard her brother's voice at the time.

1403
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,539
"Don't cry," boy said.

1404
01:29:43,539 --> 01:29:44,539
"I'm here.

1405
01:29:44,539 --> 01:29:47,559
I won't leave you, I promise.

1406
01:29:47,559 --> 01:29:50,869
I'll look after you."

1407
01:29:50,869 --> 01:29:57,330
She remembered her reply: "I'll look after
you, too."

1408
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:02,539
"Promise me," young Simon said.

1409
01:30:02,539 --> 01:30:05,179
She opened another of the older notebooks.

1410
01:30:05,179 --> 01:30:14,659
There was a list of animals, and then some
names: "Joel Broome, killed by Zuwanie's soldiers...

1411
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:19,010
Mary Broome, killed by Zuwanie's soldiers...

1412
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:24,159
Alexandra Broome, killed by Zuwanie's soldiers..."

1413
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:32,169
She picked up a pen and added another name
to the list: "Simon Broome, shot to death."

1414
01:30:32,169 --> 01:30:40,679
She looked up at the sky her face was suddenly
older and harder.

1415
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:52,039
"I promise," she whispered, as she wrote another
name in the notebook: "Silvia Broome, shot

1416
01:30:52,039 --> 01:30:55,150
to death."

1417
01:30:55,150 --> 01:31:01,019
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Death of a Killer

1418
01:31:01,019 --> 01:31:06,440
Later that night, while Russell was playing
cards in the apartment across from Silvia's

1419
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:10,300
home, Tobin looked at some photos.

1420
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:18,369
There were photos of Philippe, dead in the
bathroom, and Jamal, dead in the closet.

1421
01:31:18,369 --> 01:31:25,010
There were police photos of the African mask
and the bomb-factory kitchen.

1422
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:30,969
He looked closely at a list of telephone numbers
on the kitchen wall and copied them onto a

1423
01:31:30,969 --> 01:31:33,520
piece of paper.

1424
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:40,170
He read a police report: the hair in the mask
was Jamal's.

1425
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:45,190
There were photos of the people from the Matoban
Ambassador's office.

1426
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:52,639
He looked at Philippe's pictures from Africa:
a small town, Ajene Xola and Simon Broome

1427
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:55,769
walking into a stadium.

1428
01:31:55,769 --> 01:32:02,139
The next photo showed a large black car and
three soldiers.

1429
01:32:02,139 --> 01:32:06,579
Then there was a picture of a well-dressed
African man.

1430
01:32:06,579 --> 01:32:12,320
He was climbing out of the car and walking
toward the stadium.

1431
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,699
It was Gamba!

1432
01:32:14,699 --> 01:32:18,159
"Xola's dead..."

1433
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:20,860
Tobin said quietly.

1434
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:22,699
Russell looked up from his card game.

1435
01:32:22,699 --> 01:32:27,489
"Did you say something?" he asked.

1436
01:32:27,489 --> 01:32:30,019
Tobin didn't reply.

1437
01:32:30,019 --> 01:32:35,080
He moved to the window and looked at Silvia's
apartment.

1438
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:41,209
There was a black car outside the building
and a man in Silvia's living room.

1439
01:32:41,209 --> 01:32:45,760
"There's somebody in there!" he shouted to
Russell.

1440
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,989
He ran to the door and down into the street.

1441
01:32:50,989 --> 01:32:55,289
Gamba walked quietly through Silvia's apartment.

1442
01:32:55,289 --> 01:32:59,869
The living room was empty, so he went into
the bedroom.

1443
01:32:59,869 --> 01:33:03,939
The bathroom door was closed, but he could
hear the shower.

1444
01:33:03,939 --> 01:33:10,909
He shot three times through the door, then
kicked it down.

1445
01:33:10,909 --> 01:33:14,389
The shower was empty.

1446
01:33:14,389 --> 01:33:16,929
Tobin ran into the room.

1447
01:33:16,929 --> 01:33:22,619
Both men stopped, and then Tobin pointed his
gun at Gamba's head.

1448
01:33:22,619 --> 01:33:26,719
"Drop your gun and lie face-down on the floor.

1449
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:30,739
Now!" he shouted.

1450
01:33:30,739 --> 01:33:35,570
Gamba said something in French and lifted
up his gun.

1451
01:33:35,570 --> 01:33:37,209
Tobin shot him.

1452
01:33:37,209 --> 01:33:42,880
Then he ran into the bathroom and looked into
the shower.

1453
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,329
Where was Silvia?

1454
01:33:44,329 --> 01:33:53,309
He turned to the window; it was open and the
street below was empty.

1455
01:33:53,309 --> 01:33:57,820
Tobin called the police and his boss, Jay
Pettigrew.

1456
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:02,469
Russell joined them and they stood in the
street outside Silvia's apartment.

1457
01:34:02,469 --> 01:34:05,590
"Who is she?"

1458
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:06,869
Pettigrew asked.

1459
01:34:06,869 --> 01:34:09,599
"Does somebody want to kill her?

1460
01:34:09,599 --> 01:34:12,169
Or is she the killer?"

1461
01:34:12,169 --> 01:34:16,019
"I don't know," Tobin said.

1462
01:34:16,019 --> 01:34:19,000
"Well, where is she?"

1463
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,860
Pettigrew asked angrily.

1464
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:23,820
"Maybe you can ask her!"

1465
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:28,400
"I don't know," Tobin said again.

1466
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:32,599
"She's scared, but that doesn't tell us anything.

1467
01:34:32,599 --> 01:34:36,729
Russell, check these numbers."

1468
01:34:36,729 --> 01:34:41,540
He gave Russell the list of telephone numbers
from Jamal's kitchen wall.

1469
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:45,039
"What's happening, Tobin?"

1470
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:47,379
Pettigrew said.

1471
01:34:47,379 --> 01:34:53,459
"I thought that two different men - Jamal
and Philippe - were the killers.

1472
01:34:53,459 --> 01:34:54,999
But they're both dead.

1473
01:34:54,999 --> 01:34:57,989
Somebody wants us to ink it's one of them.

1474
01:34:57,989 --> 01:34:59,379
It isn't."

1475
01:34:59,379 --> 01:35:01,760
'What about Silvia?"

1476
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,999
Pettigrew asked.

1477
01:35:02,999 --> 01:35:07,150
"When something happens, she's always there.

1478
01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:09,139
She was on the bus with Kuman -"

1479
01:35:09,139 --> 01:35:13,300
"I don't think she's a killer," Tobin said.

1480
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:16,719
"Then who are we looking for?"

1481
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:17,909
Pettigrew said.

1482
01:35:17,909 --> 01:35:21,050
"Zuwanie will here tomorrow morning.

1483
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:24,820
We don't have much time."

1484
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:28,599
A police officer brought out Gamba's body.

1485
01:35:28,599 --> 01:35:34,099
Nils Lud arrived at the same time and looked
at the dead man's face.

1486
01:35:34,099 --> 01:35:37,769
"Who is he?" he asked.

1487
01:35:37,769 --> 01:35:41,840
"Jean Gamba," Tobin said.

1488
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,530
He looked closely at Nils Lud, but Lud's face
was empty.

1489
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:49,989
"Our bomber," Tobin continued.

1490
01:35:49,989 --> 01:35:52,379
"I shot him."

1491
01:35:52,379 --> 01:35:55,789
"Where is the interpreter?"

1492
01:35:55,789 --> 01:35:56,789
Lud asked.

1493
01:35:56,789 --> 01:35:57,829
"She's gone.

1494
01:35:57,829 --> 01:36:00,880
He missed her," Tobin said.

1495
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,479
"Can I look upstairs?"

1496
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:06,659
Lud asked.

1497
01:36:06,659 --> 01:36:09,729
Tobin sent an agent upstairs with him.

1498
01:36:09,729 --> 01:36:15,449
"Go home and get some sleep," Pettigrew said
to Tobin.

1499
01:36:15,449 --> 01:36:19,829
"I'm going to wait for her," Tobin protested.

1500
01:36:19,829 --> 01:36:23,590
"No, you're not," Pettigrew said.

1501
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:26,340
"Russell and Dot can look at her.

1502
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:28,169
You need sleep.

1503
01:36:28,169 --> 01:36:31,909
I want you to be awake tomorrow morning."

1504
01:36:31,909 --> 01:36:34,090
He looked at his watch.

1505
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:36,749
"This morning.

1506
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:41,269
We have seven hours."

1507
01:36:41,269 --> 01:36:44,119
Dot drove him home.

1508
01:36:44,119 --> 01:36:48,710
"Tobin," she said quietly, "I'm worried about
you.

1509
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:53,419
They're not our family and they're not our
friends.

1510
01:36:53,419 --> 01:36:55,489
They're our job.

1511
01:36:55,489 --> 01:36:59,510
You told me that."

1512
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:01,629
Tobin looked out the car window.

1513
01:37:01,629 --> 01:37:04,739
"I know," he said.

1514
01:37:04,739 --> 01:37:06,469
"And it's true"

1515
01:37:06,469 --> 01:37:09,789
"She'll be OK," Dot said.

1516
01:37:09,789 --> 01:37:16,719
He left the car and went into his apartment.

1517
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:20,719
There was a message on the answering machine
and he turned it on.

1518
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:26,209
He heard Silvia's voice, and street noises
behind it.

1519
01:37:26,209 --> 01:37:30,010
"... I'm fine, but I don't want to talk...

1520
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:32,459
Tobin, you were right.

1521
01:37:32,459 --> 01:37:35,330
My brother was right.

1522
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:37,260
Words don't stop the killing.

1523
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,989
I've had enough...

1524
01:37:39,989 --> 01:37:42,909
I'm going home."

1525
01:37:42,909 --> 01:37:48,909
CHAPTER TWELVE
The President Arrives

1526
01:37:48,909 --> 01:37:54,119
On Friday morning, there were hundreds of
security officers around the U.N. building.

1527
01:37:54,119 --> 01:38:00,999
There were police officers with guns on the
roof and coastguard boats on the river.

1528
01:38:00,999 --> 01:38:05,639
A large group of protesters stood outside
the U.N.

1529
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:11,820
Many of them wore face masks to protect their
families in Matobo.

1530
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:13,829
Lewis called Tobin.

1531
01:38:13,829 --> 01:38:17,329
"The numbers on Jamal's wall...

1532
01:38:17,329 --> 01:38:23,159
There's a pizza restaurant, a store, and an
international cell phone."

1533
01:38:23,159 --> 01:38:26,389
"Find the cell phone," Tobin ordered.

1534
01:38:26,389 --> 01:38:29,170
"Who owns it?"

1535
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:31,289
Then Mohammad called.

1536
01:38:31,289 --> 01:38:34,760
"Silvia used a computer to get a flight.

1537
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:37,020
But I don't know where she's going."

1538
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:45,409
"Get passenger lists for all flights to South
Africa from JFK, La Guardia, and Newark airports.

1539
01:38:45,409 --> 01:38:49,409
Find her and put her on the phone."

1540
01:38:49,409 --> 01:38:51,760
Lewis called him again.

1541
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:57,909
"The international cell phone belonged to
Jean Gamba," he said.

1542
01:38:57,909 --> 01:39:04,229
"Did he call somebody at 3:30 PM the day before
yesterday?"

1543
01:39:04,229 --> 01:39:05,599
Tobin asked.

1544
01:39:05,599 --> 01:39:08,250
"Yes," Lewis replied.

1545
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:12,900
"That was after the bomb on the bus," Tobin
said.

1546
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:15,880
"Who was the first person he called?

1547
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:19,979
Try the number, then call me back."

1548
01:39:19,979 --> 01:39:23,790
A minute later, Tobin's cell phone rang again.

1549
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:29,409
"It's a number in the Matoban government offices,"
Lewis said.

1550
01:39:29,409 --> 01:39:34,119
"Lud's number?" asked Tobin.

1551
01:39:34,119 --> 01:39:36,649
"No," Lewis replied.

1552
01:39:36,649 --> 01:39:38,769
"Somebody named Marcus Matu.

1553
01:39:38,769 --> 01:39:41,699
He's one of the Ambassador's assistants."

1554
01:39:41,699 --> 01:39:44,989
"Go there!"

1555
01:39:44,989 --> 01:39:46,539
Tobin shouted.

1556
01:39:46,539 --> 01:39:49,199
His phone rang again.

1557
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:51,530
This time it was Mohammad.

1558
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:56,999
"She's on a flight out of JFK Airport at 9:00
AM."

1559
01:39:56,999 --> 01:40:00,789
"Go to the airport and wait for her," Tobin
said.

1560
01:40:00,789 --> 01:40:03,699
"Then call me."

1561
01:40:03,699 --> 01:40:10,809
Matu and a group of Matobans arrived at the
U.N. building, they walked through the security

1562
01:40:10,809 --> 01:40:17,129
gates, past the U.N. guards, and past Tobin.

1563
01:40:17,129 --> 01:40:23,689
Dot was at JFK Airport when Edmond Zuwanie
came down the stairs from his airplane.

1564
01:40:23,689 --> 01:40:27,579
He looked old, small, and weak.

1565
01:40:27,579 --> 01:40:31,019
"Is that Zuwanie?"

1566
01:40:31,019 --> 01:40:32,889
Dot asked the agent next to her.

1567
01:40:32,889 --> 01:40:39,709
"Has that old man really killed thousands
of people?"

1568
01:40:39,709 --> 01:40:42,329
Lud greeted the President.

1569
01:40:42,329 --> 01:40:46,380
Zuwanie smiled and climbed into a car.

1570
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:53,510
Lud and Dot got in with him and they started
to drive across the city to the U.N. Zuwanie

1571
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:57,260
looked out the car window at Manhattan Island.

1572
01:40:57,260 --> 01:41:01,679
"I want to go to the theater," he said.

1573
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:05,719
"That's not possible, sir," Dot said.

1574
01:41:05,719 --> 01:41:16,070
"Last time I came here, there was a lot of
sky," the President said, "Now there are more

1575
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:17,849
tall buildings."

1576
01:41:17,849 --> 01:41:25,090
"You came here twenty-three years ago, Dr.
Zuwanie," Lud said "Things change."

1577
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:30,070
"They get less important," Zuwanie said.

1578
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:34,889
"They put flowers on the bridge during my
last visit.

1579
01:41:34,889 --> 01:41:43,610
I freed Matobo and the American people welcomed
me with flowers."

1580
01:41:43,610 --> 01:41:48,689
A few minutes later, the car arrived at the
U.N. building.

1581
01:41:48,689 --> 01:41:54,790
The protesters shouted angrily and waved their
signs at the President.

1582
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:56,689
He looked surprised.

1583
01:41:56,689 --> 01:42:01,989
"Are these people here for me?" he asked Dat.

1584
01:42:01,989 --> 01:42:08,139
"Yes," Dot replied.

1585
01:42:08,139 --> 01:42:14,840
Tobin opened the car door and Zuwanie climbed
out slowly, and took his arm and helped him

1586
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:17,280
into the building.

1587
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,570
Tobin's cell phone rang again.

1588
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:21,690
"I'm at the airport.

1589
01:42:21,690 --> 01:42:24,670
I can't see her," Mohammad said.

1590
01:42:24,670 --> 01:42:28,369
"Stay there," Tobin said.

1591
01:42:28,369 --> 01:42:30,179
He turned to Pettigrew.

1592
01:42:30,179 --> 01:42:34,199
"Can we keep Zuwanie in the safe room?

1593
01:42:34,199 --> 01:42:36,239
It will give us more time."

1594
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:39,630
"We can try," Pettigrew said.

1595
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:43,899
"But he wants to speak."

1596
01:42:43,899 --> 01:42:46,050
Tobin called Lewis and King.

1597
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:50,639
"Are you at the Matoban government offices?"
he asked.

1598
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,900
"Yes," Lewis replied.

1599
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:54,969
"But Matu isn't here.

1600
01:42:54,969 --> 01:42:57,320
He didn't come in this morning.

1601
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:00,110
Nobody knows where he is."

1602
01:43:00,110 --> 01:43:03,469
"They know where he is," King said.

1603
01:43:03,469 --> 01:43:05,889
"But they won't tell us."

1604
01:43:05,889 --> 01:43:12,119
"Get a photo of him and send it to the U.N.
security officers," Tobin said.

1605
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:16,320
"Then go to his home address."

1606
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:20,900
Two minutes later, a U.N. security officer
came up behind him.

1607
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:29,269
"This picture just arrived, sir," he said,
and he gave Tobin a photo of Matu.

1608
01:43:29,269 --> 01:43:34,469
Tobin looked at it carefully - and recognized
the face!

1609
01:43:34,469 --> 01:43:36,969
"He's here!"

1610
01:43:36,969 --> 01:43:37,969
Tobin shouted.

1611
01:43:37,969 --> 01:43:42,760
"I just saw him at the top of the stairs."

1612
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:47,189
He left Dot with Zuwanie and ran into the
main hall.

1613
01:43:47,189 --> 01:43:52,739
It was full now with hundreds of people who
were waiting for Zuwanie.

1614
01:43:52,739 --> 01:43:54,862
Tobin saw Lud sitting with the other people
from Matobo.

1615
01:43:54,862 --> 01:43:55,862
He looked up and saw the interpreters in their
booths.

1616
01:43:55,862 --> 01:43:56,862
He looked for Matu, but he couldn't see him.

1617
01:43:56,862 --> 01:43:57,862
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Murder in the U.N.

1618
01:43:57,862 --> 01:43:58,862
Marcus Matu went into the men's restroom and
pulled the paper-towel cover from the wall.

1619
01:43:58,862 --> 01:43:59,862
Pieces of a rifle were hidden behind it.

1620
01:43:59,862 --> 01:44:00,862
He put them in his bag and left the restroom,
then he ran upstairs to the interpreters'

1621
01:44:00,862 --> 01:44:01,862
booths.

1622
01:44:01,862 --> 01:44:02,862
One of the interpreters was sitting in a booth,
testing his microphone.

1623
01:44:02,862 --> 01:44:03,862
He didn't hear the door open behind him.

1624
01:44:03,862 --> 01:44:04,862
Matu hit him on the back of the head, and
the man fell to the floor.

1625
01:44:04,862 --> 01:44:05,862
Matu opened his bag and took out the pieces
of the rifle.

1626
01:44:05,862 --> 01:44:06,862
He put them together quickly and looked through
the window of the booth.

1627
01:44:06,862 --> 01:44:07,862
President Zuwanie was standing at the front
of the hall.

1628
01:44:07,862 --> 01:44:08,862
The Secretary-General introduced him and made
a short speech of welcome.

1629
01:44:08,862 --> 01:44:09,862
Then Zuwanie started to speak.

1630
01:44:09,862 --> 01:44:10,862
"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General," Zuwanie
said, "today rebels are attacking my country.

1631
01:44:10,862 --> 01:44:11,862
They will do anything to hurt me.

1632
01:44:11,862 --> 01:44:12,862
They even bombed a bus here in New York.

1633
01:44:12,862 --> 01:44:13,862
How can I protect my country from enemies
like this?"

1634
01:44:13,862 --> 01:44:14,862
Tobin stood at the back of the room, watching.

1635
01:44:14,862 --> 01:44:15,862
Lewis called him on his radio.

1636
01:44:15,862 --> 01:44:16,862
"We're at Matu's address," Lewis said.

1637
01:44:16,862 --> 01:44:17,862
"He's not here.

1638
01:44:17,862 --> 01:44:18,862
And it's not an apartment - it's an AIDS hospital.

1639
01:44:18,862 --> 01:44:19,862
This guy has nothing to live for."

1640
01:44:19,862 --> 01:44:20,862
Tobin looked again around the hall and saw
an empty seat.

1641
01:44:20,862 --> 01:44:21,862
Nils Lud was missing.

1642
01:44:21,862 --> 01:44:22,862
He looked up at the interpreters' booths.

1643
01:44:22,862 --> 01:44:23,862
There was a small hole in one of the windows.

1644
01:44:23,862 --> 01:44:24,862
"Get Zuwanie out of here!" he shouted to Dot
and Rory.

1645
01:44:24,862 --> 01:44:25,862
Then he started to run.

1646
01:44:25,862 --> 01:44:26,862
Upstairs, Matu was on his knees on the floor
of the booth.

1647
01:44:26,862 --> 01:44:27,862
There was a hole in the glass window and he
was pointing the rifle at Zuwanie.

1648
01:44:27,862 --> 01:44:28,862
The door opened.

1649
01:44:28,862 --> 01:44:29,862
Matu turned quickly and pulled the rifle back
from the window.

1650
01:44:29,862 --> 01:44:30,862
Nils Lud was standing behind him.

1651
01:44:30,862 --> 01:44:31,862
He was wearing cotton gloves and he was holding
something in his left hand.

1652
01:44:31,862 --> 01:44:32,862
"You did well," he said.

1653
01:44:32,862 --> 01:44:33,862
"Your mother and sister will get the check
for the money on Monday."

1654
01:44:33,862 --> 01:44:34,862
Matu turned back to the window and pointed
the rifle at Zuwanie again.

1655
01:44:34,862 --> 01:44:35,862
Lud put his right hand inside his jacket pocket
and took out a small gun.

1656
01:44:35,862 --> 01:44:36,862
"But I don't want you to do too well," he
said.

1657
01:44:36,862 --> 01:44:37,862
Matu tried to shoot - but nothing happened.

1658
01:44:37,862 --> 01:44:38,862
There was something wrong with the rifle.

1659
01:44:38,862 --> 01:44:39,862
He pulled it back from the window and looked
at Lud.

1660
01:44:39,862 --> 01:44:40,862
Lud smiled, then he shot Matu twice through
the head.

1661
01:44:40,862 --> 01:44:41,862
The second shot broke the window of the interpreters'
booth into a million pieces.

1662
01:44:41,862 --> 01:44:42,862
Glass fell on to the people in the hall below.

1663
01:44:42,862 --> 01:44:43,862
Some of them screamed and started to run for
the exit doors.

1664
01:44:43,862 --> 01:44:44,862
Dot and Rory were already pushing Zuwanie
out of the hall and into the safe room.

1665
01:44:44,862 --> 01:44:45,862
With his gun in his hand, Tobin ran upstairs
and into the interpreters' booth.

1666
01:44:45,862 --> 01:44:46,862
He saw the male interpreter lying on the floor
and the blood on Matu's face.

1667
01:44:46,862 --> 01:44:47,862
Then he saw Lud.

1668
01:44:47,862 --> 01:44:48,862
Lud was holding a small gun in his right hand.

1669
01:44:48,862 --> 01:44:49,862
Matu's rifle was on the floor near his left
hand.

1670
01:44:49,862 --> 01:44:50,862
"I looked up and saw him," Lud said quickly.

1671
01:44:50,862 --> 01:44:51,862
"Luckily I was able to stop him.

1672
01:44:51,862 --> 01:44:52,862
He's from our office."

1673
01:44:52,862 --> 01:44:53,862
"I know who he is," Tobin said.

1674
01:44:53,862 --> 01:44:54,862
"You can put your gun away now."

1675
01:44:54,862 --> 01:44:55,862
Lud put his gun into his pocket.

1676
01:44:55,862 --> 01:44:56,862
"He almost killed Dr. Zuwanie," Lud said.

1677
01:44:56,862 --> 01:44:57,862
"Another two or three seconds - I was almost
too late."

1678
01:44:57,862 --> 01:44:58,862
Tobin looked at him and remembered Kuman-Kuman's
words: "Zuwanie wants to stay in Matobo as

1679
01:44:58,862 --> 01:44:59,862
president.

1680
01:44:59,862 --> 01:45:00,862
People only have to think that someone is
trying to kill him.

1681
01:45:00,862 --> 01:45:01,862
That's enough to make him stronger."

1682
01:45:01,862 --> 01:45:02,862
Suddenly, he understood.

1683
01:45:02,862 --> 01:45:03,862
He moved toward the rifle and started to pick
it up.

1684
01:45:03,862 --> 01:45:04,862
"Don't touch the rifle!"

1685
01:45:04,862 --> 01:45:05,862
Lud shouted.

1686
01:45:05,862 --> 01:45:06,862
"Why?"

1687
01:45:06,862 --> 01:45:07,862
asked Tobin.

1688
01:45:07,862 --> 01:45:08,862
"Because I'm not wearing gloves?

1689
01:45:08,862 --> 01:45:09,862
It's warm today.

1690
01:45:09,862 --> 01:45:10,862
Why are you wearing gloves?"

1691
01:45:10,862 --> 01:45:11,862
"What?

1692
01:45:11,862 --> 01:45:12,862
I...

1693
01:45:12,862 --> 01:45:13,862
I..."

1694
01:45:13,862 --> 01:45:14,862
Lud couldn't answer.

1695
01:45:14,862 --> 01:45:15,862
"When the rifle didn't work," Tobin said,
"Matu was probably very surprised.

1696
01:45:15,862 --> 01:45:16,862
Did you have time to put the piece back in?"

1697
01:45:16,862 --> 01:45:17,862
He pointed the rifle and Lud jumped back.

1698
01:45:17,862 --> 01:45:18,862
"Yes," Tobin said.

1699
01:45:18,862 --> 01:45:19,862
"I guess you did.

1700
01:45:19,862 --> 01:45:20,862
But you were wearing gloves, so nobody will
know.

1701
01:45:20,862 --> 01:45:21,862
Only Matu's fingerprints are on that gun."

1702
01:45:21,862 --> 01:45:22,862
The door opened and two U.N. security officers
came in.

1703
01:45:22,862 --> 01:45:23,862
Lud reached into his pocket for his gun, but
Tobin and the officers were quicker.

1704
01:45:23,862 --> 01:45:24,862
Dot ran into the room.

1705
01:45:24,862 --> 01:45:25,862
"Nobody is going to shoot Zuwanie," Tobin
told her.

1706
01:45:25,862 --> 01:45:26,862
"It was a smart plant.

1707
01:45:26,862 --> 01:45:27,862
People will listen to a man in danger.

1708
01:45:27,862 --> 01:45:28,862
They'll understand why he has to kill."

1709
01:45:28,862 --> 01:45:29,862
He turned to Lud.

1710
01:45:29,862 --> 01:45:30,862
"Are you the bad guy, Lud?

1711
01:45:30,862 --> 01:45:31,862
Or are you working for a bigger bad guy?"

1712
01:45:31,862 --> 01:45:32,862
He and Dot left the room.

1713
01:45:32,862 --> 01:45:33,862
"Are you OK?"

1714
01:45:33,862 --> 01:45:34,862
Dot asked.

1715
01:45:34,862 --> 01:45:35,862
"Where's Zuwanie?"

1716
01:45:35,862 --> 01:45:36,862
Tobin asked.

1717
01:45:36,862 --> 01:45:37,862
"In the safe room.

1718
01:45:37,862 --> 01:45:38,862
What happened in there?"

1719
01:45:38,862 --> 01:45:39,862
Tobin started to answer, but his cell phone
rang.

1720
01:45:39,862 --> 01:45:40,862
It was Mohammad.

1721
01:45:40,862 --> 01:45:41,862
"I've checked every flight and every hotel
in New York.

1722
01:45:41,862 --> 01:45:42,862
I've asked her friends.

1723
01:45:42,862 --> 01:45:43,862
Nobody knows her very well.

1724
01:45:43,862 --> 01:45:44,862
They don't know where she is."

1725
01:45:44,862 --> 01:45:45,862
"I know her," Tobin said slowly.

1726
01:45:45,862 --> 01:45:46,862
"She said 'I'm going home.'"

1727
01:45:46,862 --> 01:45:47,862
"Where is home?"

1728
01:45:47,862 --> 01:45:48,862
Dot asked.

1729
01:45:48,862 --> 01:45:49,862
"Here," Tobin said.

1730
01:45:49,862 --> 01:45:50,862
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Silvia and the President

1731
01:45:50,862 --> 01:45:51,862
Zuwanie was alone in the safe room when the
door opened, Silvia walked in, carrying a

1732
01:45:51,862 --> 01:45:52,862
bag.

1733
01:45:52,862 --> 01:45:53,862
"Dr. Zuwanie," she said.

1734
01:45:53,862 --> 01:45:54,862
"Yes?" he replied and smiled at her.

1735
01:45:54,862 --> 01:45:55,862
"I remember your last visit to the U.N.,"
Silvia said.

1736
01:45:55,862 --> 01:45:56,862
"That was a long time ago," Zuwanie said.

1737
01:45:56,862 --> 01:45:57,862
"You were very young.

1738
01:45:57,862 --> 01:45:58,862
I was very young!"

1739
01:45:58,862 --> 01:45:59,862
"We watched you on TV, back home in Matobo.

1740
01:45:59,862 --> 01:46:00,862
My family, all the families, watched you.

1741
01:46:00,862 --> 01:46:01,862
You were like a movie star."

1742
01:46:01,862 --> 01:46:02,862
Zuwanie laughed.

1743
01:46:02,862 --> 01:46:03,862
"I don't think so!"

1744
01:46:03,862 --> 01:46:04,862
"You were" Silvia said.

1745
01:46:04,862 --> 01:46:05,862
"We were excited and very proud of you because
you were speaking to the world.

1746
01:46:05,862 --> 01:46:06,862
But that was a long time ago."

1747
01:46:06,862 --> 01:46:07,862
Her voice grew harder.

1748
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:08,862
"What is your name, child?"

1749
01:46:08,862 --> 01:46:09,862
Zuwanie asked.

1750
01:46:09,862 --> 01:46:10,862
"Silvia.

1751
01:46:10,862 --> 01:46:11,862
You killed my family."

1752
01:46:11,862 --> 01:46:12,862
Zuwanie suddenly looked uncomfortable.

1753
01:46:12,862 --> 01:46:13,862
His eyes moved around the room.

1754
01:46:13,862 --> 01:46:14,862
"Where is everyone?"

1755
01:46:14,862 --> 01:46:15,862
"We're alone," Silvia said.

1756
01:46:15,862 --> 01:46:16,862
She moved very quickly toward him and took
a gun out of his pocket.

1757
01:46:16,862 --> 01:46:17,862
"You always carry this gun.

1758
01:46:17,862 --> 01:46:18,862
I saw it in every picture, everywhere you
went.

1759
01:46:18,862 --> 01:46:19,862
You saved our country with this gun."

1760
01:46:19,862 --> 01:46:20,862
She held the gun in her hand, but she didn't
point it at Zuwanie.

1761
01:46:20,862 --> 01:46:21,862
"Then you used it to kill your people."

1762
01:46:21,862 --> 01:46:22,862
She pulled a small book out of her bag.

1763
01:46:22,862 --> 01:46:23,862
It was Zuwanie's life story.

1764
01:46:23,862 --> 01:46:24,862
She opened it and read: "You must fight for
your land and country before you can understand

1765
01:46:24,862 --> 01:46:25,862
the importance of that lane and country."

1766
01:46:25,862 --> 01:46:26,862
"Who said that?"

1767
01:46:26,862 --> 01:46:27,862
Zuwanie looked closely at her face, but he
didn't speak.

1768
01:46:27,862 --> 01:46:28,862
"Yes, you did," Silvia said.

1769
01:46:28,862 --> 01:46:29,862
"I was eleven years old and I loved you.

1770
01:46:29,862 --> 01:46:30,862
You were my teacher."

1771
01:46:30,862 --> 01:46:31,862
She turned the page and showed Zuwanie a photo
of a little boy.

1772
01:46:31,862 --> 01:46:32,862
"Look at yourself!"

1773
01:46:32,862 --> 01:46:33,862
she said.

1774
01:46:33,862 --> 01:46:34,862
"The good times are past," Zuwanie said.

1775
01:46:34,862 --> 01:46:35,862
"Finished."

1776
01:46:35,862 --> 01:46:36,862
"It's not finished!"

1777
01:46:36,862 --> 01:46:37,862
Silvia shouted.

1778
01:46:37,862 --> 01:46:38,862
"Not until you die."

1779
01:46:38,862 --> 01:46:39,862
"But I'm not ready to die."

1780
01:46:39,862 --> 01:46:40,862
Silvia pulled a notebook out of her bag.

1781
01:46:40,862 --> 01:46:41,862
"These people weren't ready to die!"

1782
01:46:41,862 --> 01:46:42,862
she screamed.

1783
01:46:42,862 --> 01:46:43,862
"You were a good man - and now...

1784
01:46:43,862 --> 01:46:44,862
You gave your people so much - and then you
took it away."

1785
01:46:44,862 --> 01:46:45,862
She moved toward him and placed the gun against
his head.

1786
01:46:45,862 --> 01:46:46,862
Tobin and Dot met Chief Wu, Rory, and some
U.N. security guards at the safe room door.

1787
01:46:46,862 --> 01:46:47,862
"Is he in there?"

1788
01:46:47,862 --> 01:46:48,862
Tobin asked.

1789
01:46:48,862 --> 01:46:49,862
"Yes," Wu replied.

1790
01:46:49,862 --> 01:46:50,862
"What's happening?"

1791
01:46:50,862 --> 01:46:51,862
"Keep everyone out," Tobin said to Dot.

1792
01:46:51,862 --> 01:46:52,862
"Give me a few minutes."

1793
01:46:52,862 --> 01:46:53,862
He stood near the door and called, "Silvia!

1794
01:46:53,862 --> 01:46:54,862
I'm coming in.

1795
01:46:54,862 --> 01:46:55,862
It's really me.

1796
01:46:55,862 --> 01:46:56,862
I'm coming in now."

1797
01:46:56,862 --> 01:46:57,862
He opened the door slowly and looked inside
the room.

1798
01:46:57,862 --> 01:46:58,862
Silvia was pointing the gun at Zuwanie's head.

1799
01:46:58,862 --> 01:46:59,862
Tobin saw Simon's notebook on the table in
front of the President.

1800
01:46:59,862 --> 01:47:00,862
"Close the door," Silvia said.

1801
01:47:00,862 --> 01:47:01,862
Tobin looked back at Dot, Rory, and Wu.

1802
01:47:01,862 --> 01:47:02,862
"It's OK," he said to them and went inside
the room.

1803
01:47:02,862 --> 01:47:03,862
He closed the door and turned to Silvia.

1804
01:47:03,862 --> 01:47:04,862
"Don't do this.

1805
01:47:04,862 --> 01:47:05,862
We have Nils Lud and the rifle.

1806
01:47:05,862 --> 01:47:06,862
That's all we need."

1807
01:47:06,862 --> 01:47:07,862
"But I have him," Silvia said and pointed
at Zuwanie.

1808
01:47:07,862 --> 01:47:08,862
"Silvia," Tobin said softly, "he's finished.

1809
01:47:08,862 --> 01:47:09,862
Lud is, too.

1810
01:47:09,862 --> 01:47:10,862
Zuwanie will die in prison.

1811
01:47:10,862 --> 01:47:11,862
"Simon didn't die in prison - he was shot.

1812
01:47:11,862 --> 01:47:12,862
I want him to die the same way."

1813
01:47:12,862 --> 01:47:13,862
"He will die in ten seconds, but you'll remember
killing him at the rest of your life."

1814
01:47:13,862 --> 01:47:14,862
He turned to Zuwanie.

1815
01:47:14,862 --> 01:47:15,862
"Matu is dead.

1816
01:47:15,862 --> 01:47:16,862
Your head of security has told us everything.

1817
01:47:16,862 --> 01:47:17,862
That leaves you."

1818
01:47:17,862 --> 01:47:18,862
Zuwanie opened his mouth to speak, but Tobin
stopped him.

1819
01:47:18,862 --> 01:47:19,862
"It was a good plan," he said.

1820
01:47:19,862 --> 01:47:20,862
"You're 'almost' murdered and people understand
you better.

1821
01:47:20,862 --> 01:47:21,862
But now it's finished.

1822
01:47:21,862 --> 01:47:22,862
You'll go to court."

1823
01:47:22,862 --> 01:47:23,862
Silvia pressed the gun harder against Zuwanie's
head.

1824
01:47:23,862 --> 01:47:24,862
"No, he won't," she said.

1825
01:47:24,862 --> 01:47:25,862
"Silvia, listen," Tobin said.

1826
01:47:25,862 --> 01:47:26,862
"Remember the story about the Ku?

1827
01:47:26,862 --> 01:47:27,862
The family can watch a murderer die or they
can save him.

1828
01:47:27,862 --> 01:47:28,862
I hate the man who destroyed my life.

1829
01:47:28,862 --> 01:47:29,862
But I don't want to kill him."

1830
01:47:29,862 --> 01:47:30,862
"Then you're wrong," Silvia said.

1831
01:47:30,862 --> 01:47:31,862
"No, I'm not," Tobin said.

1832
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:32,862
"I don't want to be sad for the rest of my
life."

1833
01:47:32,862 --> 01:47:33,862
Zuwanie picked up Simon's notebook.

1834
01:47:33,862 --> 01:47:34,862
"What's this?" he asked.

1835
01:47:34,862 --> 01:47:35,862
They weren't listening to him and he started
reading the names in the book.

1836
01:47:35,862 --> 01:47:36,862
"Leave this room now," Silvia ordered Tobin.

1837
01:47:36,862 --> 01:47:37,862
"I can't," Tobin said.

1838
01:47:37,862 --> 01:47:38,862
"Put the gun down".

1839
01:47:38,862 --> 01:47:39,862
"I can't," Silvia said.

1840
01:47:39,862 --> 01:47:40,862
"You can."

1841
01:47:40,862 --> 01:47:41,862
"Just go!"

1842
01:47:41,862 --> 01:47:42,862
she shouted.

1843
01:47:42,862 --> 01:47:43,862
Tobin quickly pulled out his gun and pointed
it at her.

1844
01:47:43,862 --> 01:47:44,862
Then he slowly placed it on the table.

1845
01:47:44,862 --> 01:47:45,862
"See?

1846
01:47:45,862 --> 01:47:46,862
It's easy to put down a gun."

1847
01:47:46,862 --> 01:47:47,862
She looked at him but she didn't move.

1848
01:47:47,862 --> 01:47:48,862
"Shoot him and he'll be dead," Tobin said.

1849
01:47:48,862 --> 01:47:49,862
"And then you'll be dead... and...

1850
01:47:49,862 --> 01:47:50,862
I'll be dead, too."

1851
01:47:50,862 --> 01:47:51,862
Silvia's hand was shaking.

1852
01:47:51,862 --> 01:47:52,862
Suddenly, she looked at Zuwanie and pointed
at the book on the table.

1853
01:47:52,862 --> 01:47:53,862
"Read it!"

1854
01:47:53,862 --> 01:47:54,862
she shouted.

1855
01:47:54,862 --> 01:47:55,862
Zuwanie put down the notebook and picked up
his life story.

1856
01:47:55,862 --> 01:47:56,862
"Where?

1857
01:47:56,862 --> 01:47:57,862
Which part?"

1858
01:47:57,862 --> 01:47:58,862
"The first page," Silvia said.

1859
01:47:58,862 --> 01:47:59,862
Slowly and quietly, Zuwanie started to read:
"The guns around us..."

1860
01:47:59,862 --> 01:48:00,862
"Louder," Silvia said.

1861
01:48:00,862 --> 01:48:01,862
"Like when you wrote it.

1862
01:48:01,862 --> 01:48:02,862
When you believed in it.

1863
01:48:02,862 --> 01:48:03,862
When it meant something."

1864
01:48:03,862 --> 01:48:04,862
Zuwanie tried again.

1865
01:48:04,862 --> 01:48:05,862
"The guns around us make it hard to hear.

1866
01:48:05,862 --> 01:48:06,862
But a man's voice is different from other
sounds.

1867
01:48:06,862 --> 01:48:07,862
We can hear it over all other noises.

1868
01:48:07,862 --> 01:48:08,862
We can hear a whisper above the noise of a
thousand soldiers..."

1869
01:48:08,862 --> 01:48:09,862
"When?

1870
01:48:09,862 --> 01:48:10,862
When?'

1871
01:48:10,862 --> 01:48:11,862
Silvia shouted.

1872
01:48:11,862 --> 01:48:12,862
"... when it is telling the truth," Zuwanie
read.

1873
01:48:12,862 --> 01:48:13,862
He looked at the picture of himself when he
was small boy.

1874
01:48:13,862 --> 01:48:14,862
Then he picked up Simon's notebook again,
and his hand moved slowly across the names

1875
01:48:14,862 --> 01:48:15,862
of the dead.

1876
01:48:15,862 --> 01:48:16,862
"That little boy was my country," Silvia said.

1877
01:48:16,862 --> 01:48:17,862
Tobin reached out his hand toward her.

1878
01:48:17,862 --> 01:48:18,862
She looked at him for a long time, and then
she looked at Zuwanie.

1879
01:48:18,862 --> 01:48:19,862
Slowly, she gave the gun to Tobin and he put
it in his pocket.

1880
01:48:19,862 --> 01:48:20,862
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
The Names of the Dead

1881
01:48:20,862 --> 01:48:21,862
The main hall of the U.N. was full of people
again.

1882
01:48:21,862 --> 01:48:22,862
The interpreters were in their booths.

1883
01:48:22,862 --> 01:48:23,862
"Dr. Zuwanie, the President of Matobo, will
continue his speech," the U.N. Secretary-General

1884
01:48:23,862 --> 01:48:24,862
said.

1885
01:48:24,862 --> 01:48:25,862
Zuwanie and Silvia walked to the front of
the silent room.

1886
01:48:25,862 --> 01:48:26,862
Zuwanie looked at the people in front of him,
then he started to speak in Ku.

1887
01:48:26,862 --> 01:48:27,862
Silvia interpreted his words into English.

1888
01:48:27,862 --> 01:48:28,862
"Nukwe wa Bamcha...

1889
01:48:28,862 --> 01:48:29,862
Temsha wa Bamcha... killed by bombs.

1890
01:48:29,862 --> 01:48:30,862
Bukewechu we Lali...

1891
01:48:30,862 --> 01:48:31,862
Alexander Mungoshi... shot by soldiers.

1892
01:48:31,862 --> 01:48:32,862
Stambuli wa Tikuu...

1893
01:48:32,862 --> 01:48:33,862
Ruth Kufomo... killed for crimes against Matobo."

1894
01:48:33,862 --> 01:48:34,862
Tobin stood at the back of the hall and listened.

1895
01:48:34,862 --> 01:48:35,862
Zuwanie continued.

1896
01:48:35,862 --> 01:48:36,862
"Edgar Sekuu...

1897
01:48:36,862 --> 01:48:37,862
Avu wa Mfusani..."

1898
01:48:37,862 --> 01:48:38,862
"Killed in their home by a bomb," Silvia interpreted.

1899
01:48:38,862 --> 01:48:39,862
There were microphones inside the hall, so
the protesters outside the building could

1900
01:48:39,862 --> 01:48:40,862
hear Zuwanie's words.

1901
01:48:40,862 --> 01:48:41,862
"He's reading a list of the names of the dead,"
one protester whispered.

1902
01:48:41,862 --> 01:48:42,862
"He's saying that he murdered them."

1903
01:48:42,862 --> 01:48:43,862
Inside, too, people were beginning to understand.

1904
01:48:43,862 --> 01:48:44,862
"Zimwe wa Ngwama...

1905
01:48:44,862 --> 01:48:45,862
Dukura wa Mboko... holding a newborn child,"
Zuwanie said in Ku.

1906
01:48:45,862 --> 01:48:46,862
"I don't know its name."

1907
01:48:46,862 --> 01:48:47,862
And then in English: "I'm sorry."

1908
01:48:47,862 --> 01:48:48,862
He looked at Silvia.

1909
01:48:48,862 --> 01:48:49,862
He read the names for a long time.

1910
01:48:49,862 --> 01:48:50,862
Finally he said, "Simon Broome," and Silvia
repeated, in English, "... shot to death."

1911
01:48:50,862 --> 01:48:51,862
Two days later, the sun was shining on New
York, Tobin was outside the U.N. building,

1912
01:48:51,862 --> 01:48:52,862
watching the river.

1913
01:48:52,862 --> 01:48:53,862
Silvia came out and walked over to him.

1914
01:48:53,862 --> 01:48:54,862
"Hi," she said.

1915
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:55,862
Tobin turned around.

1916
01:48:55,862 --> 01:48:56,862
"Hi," he said.

1917
01:48:56,862 --> 01:48:57,862
"What happened?"

1918
01:48:57,862 --> 01:48:58,862
"It was OK," she replied.

1919
01:48:58,862 --> 01:48:59,862
"They told me what you said.

1920
01:48:59,862 --> 01:49:00,862
You don't think I'm dangerous."

1921
01:49:00,862 --> 01:49:01,862
"Yes," Tobin said.

1922
01:49:01,862 --> 01:49:02,862
"I lied."

1923
01:49:02,862 --> 01:49:03,862
They both smiled.

1924
01:49:03,862 --> 01:49:04,862
"Thank you," Silvia said.

1925
01:49:04,862 --> 01:49:05,862
"Are you at work again?"

1926
01:49:05,862 --> 01:49:06,862
Tobin asked.

1927
01:49:06,862 --> 01:49:07,862
"No," Silvia said.

1928
01:49:07,862 --> 01:49:08,862
"They didn't believe you.

1929
01:49:08,862 --> 01:49:09,862
I'm going home."

1930
01:49:09,862 --> 01:49:10,862
"Home?

1931
01:49:10,862 --> 01:49:11,862
To Africa?"

1932
01:49:11,862 --> 01:49:12,862
"Yes," Silvia said quietly.

1933
01:49:12,862 --> 01:49:13,862
"I miss it.

1934
01:49:13,862 --> 01:49:14,862
I never had the time to tell you.

1935
01:49:14,862 --> 01:49:15,862
I miss the animals at night, the rain, the
smells."

1936
01:49:15,862 --> 01:49:16,862
"We've got rain here, and smells," Tobin said
and pointed at the river.

1937
01:49:16,862 --> 01:49:17,862
"There's nobody there for you in Africa, is
there?"

1938
01:49:17,862 --> 01:49:18,862
"No," she said.

1939
01:49:18,862 --> 01:49:19,862
"But I can remember them there."

1940
01:49:19,862 --> 01:49:20,862
"You can remember people anywhere," Tobin
said.

1941
01:49:20,862 --> 01:49:21,862
Silvia understood that he was thinking about
his wife.

1942
01:49:21,862 --> 01:49:22,862
She touched his arm.

1943
01:49:22,862 --> 01:49:23,862
"My job has changed," he continued.

1944
01:49:23,862 --> 01:49:24,862
"Who am I protecting?

1945
01:49:24,862 --> 01:49:25,862
I need to know.

1946
01:49:25,862 --> 01:49:26,862
Maybe I need a change."

1947
01:49:26,862 --> 01:49:27,862
"Have you visited Africa?"

1948
01:49:27,862 --> 01:49:28,862
Tobin laughed.

1949
01:49:28,862 --> 01:49:29,862
"I was born in New York, and I went to school
on the same street.

1950
01:49:29,862 --> 01:49:30,862
Then I came across the river to Manhattan.

1951
01:49:30,862 --> 01:49:31,862
It's not far."

1952
01:49:31,862 --> 01:49:32,862
"You're a traveler," Silvia smiled.

1953
01:49:32,862 --> 01:49:33,862
"I've known you for five or six days - it
feels much longer."

1954
01:49:33,862 --> 01:49:34,862
"When are you leaving?"

1955
01:49:34,862 --> 01:49:35,862
Tobin asked.

1956
01:49:35,862 --> 01:49:36,862
"Tomorrow," Silvia said.

1957
01:49:36,862 --> 01:49:37,862
"Will you be safe?

1958
01:49:37,862 --> 01:49:38,862
Is there another Zuwanie in Matobo?"

1959
01:49:38,862 --> 01:49:39,862
"No.

1960
01:49:39,862 --> 01:49:40,862
That can't happen.

1961
01:49:40,862 --> 01:49:41,862
We won't let it."

1962
01:49:41,862 --> 01:49:42,862
Tobin smiled at her.

1963
01:49:42,862 --> 01:49:43,862
"You're already there, aren't you?" he said
softly.

1964
01:49:43,862 --> 01:49:44,862
Then he pointed at the water.

1965
01:49:44,862 --> 01:49:45,862
"Hey, look - we're on the same side of the
river now."

1966
01:49:45,862 --> 01:49:46,862
"Will you be OK?"

1967
01:49:46,862 --> 01:49:47,862
Silvia asked.

1968
01:49:47,862 --> 01:49:48,862
"Will you tell me?"

1969
01:49:48,862 --> 01:49:49,862
She turned to leave, but he stopped her.

1970
01:49:49,862 --> 01:49:50,862
He pulled her close and kissed her, then she
moved away.

1971
01:49:50,862 --> 01:49:51,862
"You'll always know," Tobin said.

1972
01:49:51,862 --> 01:49:52,862
Silvia walked a few steps away from him and
then stopped again.

1973
01:49:52,862 --> 01:49:53,862
"What was her name?

1974
01:49:53,862 --> 01:49:54,862
Your wife?"

1975
01:49:54,862 --> 01:49:55,862
she asked.

1976
01:49:55,862 --> 01:49:56,862
"Laurie Keller," Tobin said.

1977
01:49:56,862 --> 01:49:57,862
"Killed in a car accident in Santa Fe.

1978
01:49:57,862 --> 01:49:58,862
Twenty-three days ago."

1979
01:49:58,862 --> 01:49:59,862
Silvia smiled sadly at him and said a few
words in Ku.

1980
01:49:59,862 --> 01:50:00,862
Tobin guessed the meaning.

1981
01:50:00,862 --> 01:50:01,862
"Rest in peace," he said.

1982
01:50:01,862 --> 01:50:02,862
Silvia walked away toward the U.N. gates.

1983
01:50:02,862 --> 01:50:03,862
She didn't look at him again, but she was
still smiling.

1984
01:50:03,862 --> 01:50:04,862
Tobin looked back at the calm, wide river
and across it toward Africa.

1985
01:50:04,862 --> 01:50:04,864
- THE END -
