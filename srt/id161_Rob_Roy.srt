00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,840
CHAPTER ONE
Exiled from London

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,350
Dear Will, do you remember me?

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:22,250
I am Frank Osbaldistone and I want to narrate
the adventurous story of my early life.

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,770
It was the year 1714 and I was about twenty.

5
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:35,840
My father ordered me to come back from Bordeaux,
France, where I worked and to return to London.

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,100
My father was the founder of the business
house Osbaldistone & Tresham, with offices

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,030
in Crane Alley, London.

8
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,719
He was a tall man, full of energy, with dark,
penetrating eyes.

9
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,930
He had a fiery spirit, full of initiative
and acute powers of analysis.

10
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:03,730
He never used a word in vain, and he never
got really angry, but when he was displeased,

11
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,610
he spoke in a brusque manner.

12
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,730
My father wanted me to become his successor
in the family business, but I preferred to

13
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,120
study literature and write poems.

14
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,760
He tried everything to convince me to change
my mind and eventually threatened, "I have

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,940
a brother in Northumberland and he too has
children, Frank.

16
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,360
I will ask one of your cousins to take your
place in the business, if you do not obey

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,580
me."

18
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:39,970
Showing little respect for his wishes, I replied,
"You can do as you please - the business is

19
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,970
yours!

20
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,560
I will never sell my liberty for gold!"

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,470
As I was very obstinate, in the end my father
decided to send me to his brother at Osbaldistone

22
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,130
Hall in the north of England.

23
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,500
The following morning I took the road to York,
mounted on a good horse and with sixty guineas

24
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,360
in my pocket.

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,810
I was sad, but I did not want to go back to
London.

26
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,170
I wanted to show my father that I was adult
enough to decide for myself and that I was

27
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,380
truly convinced of my decision.

28
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,060
The journey was monotonous, but sometimes
I had the opportunity to speak to different

29
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,950
travellers - parsons, farmers, officers.

30
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:32,319
We spoke of many different matters - taxes,
markets, wars and outlaws.

31
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,030
One man that I met, a Mr Morris, was particularly
afraid of outlaws.

32
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,019
He had a heavy portmanteau which he never
abandoned for a moment.

33
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:51,430
He never mentioned his destination, he trusted
nobody and he was afraid of me, too.

34
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,930
In those days travellers used to break their
journey on Sundays.

35
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,689
They rested their horses and had dinner together
at the local inn, where the innkeeper offered

36
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,579
them a meal.

37
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:10,310
On this particular Sunday I stopped at Darlington,
at the "Black Bear", with my new companion,

38
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,739
the strange Mr Morris.

39
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,180
A Scotsman, Mr Campbell, joined us for dinner.

40
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,859
It was the first time I had met a Scotsman
and I looked at him with curiosity because

41
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:28,780
I had many prejudices against the inhabitants
of Scotland.

42
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:36,209
When I was a child my nurse told me terrible
stories about them, of blood and revenge.

43
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:43,689
I considered the Scottish people dishonest,
avaricious and hostile to Englishmen.

44
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:49,709
Mr Campbell was a tall, athletic man who spoke
to other people with superiority.

45
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:56,599
Strangely, my timorous companion Mr Morris
asked if he could travel north with him, but

46
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,060
Mr Campbell refused.

47
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,519
"Your companion talks too much," he said.

48
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:27,100
"It is unsafe to say where you are going in
these troubled times."

49
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,720
CHAPTER TWO
The Osbaldistones

50
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,070
The following morning, I left the company
to go westward where my uncle lived in Osbaldistone

51
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,750
Hall.

52
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,320
The landscape was romantic and picturesque
and appealed to my love of nature.

53
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,230
I went past rivers and little solitary valleys
until I arrived at Osbaldistone Hall.

54
00:04:53,230 --> 00:05:01,220
The house was in a glen between two mountains,
surrounded by a large wood of oaks.

55
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:07,280
I was on a hill above Osbaldistone Hall when
I heard the sound of dogs and horses - it

56
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:18,840
was a fox hunt.

57
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:25,150
I saw some men, dressed in green and red uniforms,
riding after the fox and I thought: 'Here

58
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,620
are my cousins.'

59
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,680
Suddenly I had a vision - a beautiful young
lady appeared in front of me.

60
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,440
Her face was uncommonly fine and animated
by the hunt.

61
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,220
She had long, black hair down to her shoulders.

62
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:50,220
She was wearing riding clothes, like a man,
and rode a splendid black horse.

63
00:05:50,220 --> 00:06:04,340
Just then the sound of a horn announced the
end of the chase.

64
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:13,100
A young man came triumphantly towards us.

65
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,110
He was carrying the fox's tail in his hand.

66
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:24,330
The young woman spoke to him, then she turned
to me and said, "Excuse me, did you meet a

67
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,440
young man on the road, a Mr Osbaldistone?"

68
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,810
"I am Francis Osbaldistone," I answered.

69
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,810
"Ah...

70
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,930
I'm pleased to meet you, Mr Osbaldistone.

71
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:46,260
This young man is Thorncliff Osbaldistone,
your cousin, and I am Diana Vernon," she continued.

72
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:52,810
Diana accompanied me to Osbaldistone Hall,
where my uncle, Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone,

73
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,330
welcomed me.

74
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,360
He was a man of about sixty, dressed in hunting
clothes.

75
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,140
Once he had been a soldier and a knight under
King James II.

76
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,900
Alter the king's deposition, he retired to
his lands in the countryside where he was

77
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,900
lord.

78
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,750
"These are your cousins, Francis," he told
me.

79
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,890
"Percie, Thornie, John, Dick, Wilfred and
Rashleigh.

80
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,530
The girl you met earlier is Die Vernon, Diana,
my dead wife's niece.

81
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,710
She lives here too.

82
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,220
Now, shall we have dinner together?"

83
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:37,610
My cousins were all tall, well-built and good-humoured,
with the exception of Rashleigh.

84
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:45,740
He was different from the others - short,
thin, lame, and his expression was cruel.

85
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:53,890
However, these disadvantages were partly compensated
for by his very soft, sweet voice and his

86
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,770
great ability in putting words together.

87
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:04,630
Diana Vernon was sitting next to me at dinner
and gave me some information about my cousins.

88
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:11,560
"Rashleigh," she said, "wanted to become a
priest in the Roman Catholic Church, but his

89
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,600
deformity prevented him from entering the
seminary."

90
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,120
She also revealed that my father had chosen
Rashleigh to take my place in his company.

91
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:30,890
After dinner my cousins started to drink and
laugh immoderately.

92
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:36,709
As my foreign education had given me a dislike
for intemperance, I preferred to be alone

93
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:40,279
and decided to go for a walk in the garden.

94
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,069
On one of the little paths I met a gardener.

95
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:47,480
He touched his Scottish bonnet with an air
of respect.

96
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,749
"Good evening, my Lord!" he said.

97
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:53,910
"I am Andrew Fairservice.

98
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,990
For twenty-four years I have served the Osbaldistones."

99
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,490
He was very talkative.

100
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:06,080
He told me that he was a Presbyterian and
when he heard that I was an English dissenter,

101
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,100
he took out a tobacco box and offered me a
little.

102
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,120
I asked him about Die Vernon.

103
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,889
"Oh, the young mistress?

104
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,720
The lassie Vernon?" he answered.

105
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:44,620
"She is a Catholic and, what is worse, she
is a Jacobite!"

106
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:51,560
CHAPTER THREE
Accused of Robbery!

107
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:59,069
I went to bed that night, thinking about the
strange Osbaldistone family, my father, Rashleigh

108
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:01,589
and Die Vernon.

109
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:17,250
When I woke up, I heard the horn announcing
that the fox hunt was beginning again.

110
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:24,959
In the courtyard, where men, dogs and horses
were in full preparation, I met Die Vernon.

111
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:32,060
We left with the rest of the hunting party,
but after a few miles we were alone.

112
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:38,740
Die guided me to the top of a hill, and stopped
her horse under some trees.

113
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,470
She indicated some mountains on the far horizon.

114
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,120
She said that they were in Scotland and that
if necessary my horse could take me there

115
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,410
in two hours.

116
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,170
I was surprised.

117
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,860
I had no desire to go to Scotland.

118
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,269
"What should I do in Scotland?"

119
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:58,629
I asked.

120
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:02,140
"Provide for your safety..." she replied.

121
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,439
"Didn't you travel here with a man, a Mr Morris?"

122
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:08,620
the girl asked me then.

123
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,959
"Well... yes.

124
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,949
I travelled with a strange little man who
was always worried about his portmanteau,"

125
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,769
I answered, slowly.

126
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:23,200
"Someone stole that bag, Frank!"

127
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,750
explained Die.

128
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,410
"You do not think I am a thief!"

129
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,279
I replied, angrily.

130
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,690
"Mr Morris is an agent for the London government,"
she continued.

131
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:40,350
"He was carrying important documents and money
for the English soldiers in the north.

132
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,269
You are accused of robbery and of treason,
Frank Osbaldistone!"

133
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:47,470
"So, I am a traitor, too!"

134
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,589
I exclaimed angrily.

135
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,720
She saw I was angry and tried to console me.

136
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,459
"Around here many important people are in
favour of James II and against the Hanoverians,"

137
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:02,459
she said.

138
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:07,300
"Your crime is considered the crime of a gentleman
- and a kings man."

139
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,459
"But I want to refute this terrible accusation!

140
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,269
Who is examining my case?"

141
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:14,459
I demanded.

142
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,069
"Judge Ingle wood.

143
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,889
He told my uncle to show you the road to Scotland,"
replied Die.

144
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:24,779
"Then I must see him and tell him the truth!"

145
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,410
Diana insisted on accompanying me.

146
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,930
When we arrived, we were surprised to meet
Rashleigh coming out of Judge Ingle wood's

147
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,290
house.

148
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,339
The Judge was having lunch when we entered.

149
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:46,050
Another man was with him at the table - it
was Mr Morris, my timorous travelling companion.

150
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,779
He said that one of the robbers had mentioned
the name of Osbaldistone.

151
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:54,589
"But that is not a good reason to accuse me!"

152
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:56,940
I replied.

153
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,009
At that moment, the servant announced the
arrival of another gentleman and I was surprised

154
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:07,959
to see Mr Campbell, the other man I had met
on my journey north.

155
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:12,819
He explained to Judge Inglewood that he had
been with Mr Morris when the bandits attacked

156
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:13,819
him.

157
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:17,779
"Why didn't you help Mr Morris, then?" asked
the Judge.

158
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:22,769
"Mr Morris is strong enough to defend himself,"
he replied coldly.

159
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,189
"I am a man of peace.

160
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:28,249
I do not want to have trouble with the Law.

161
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:35,389
But of one thing I am sure - Mr Osbaldistone
was not one of the bandits who stole the bag."

162
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:43,750
At that point, Mr Morris retracted his accusations
against me and the Judge declared I was innocent.

163
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,600
Soon after, Mr Morris left the house with
Campbell.

164
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,480
Die Vernon and I rode back to Osbaldistone
Hall.

165
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,449
The girl started to tell me something of her
life.

166
00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:00,339
She had many troubles, she said.

167
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:09,959
I tried to learn more but she replied mysteriously,
"I cannot reveal my secrets."

168
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,610
At Osbaldistone Hall, Die ordered dinner for
us in the library.

169
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:22,790
The ancient, dark library was full of books,
very untidy and neglected.

170
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:30,629
On one wall was a portrait of Die's grandfather,
Lord Vernon, with the Vernon motto above it.

171
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:35,879
He had been loyal to the Kings of the Stuart
dynasty, she said, and had shared the misfortunes

172
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,879
of Charles I.

173
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:43,180
The Vernon family, once important, was now
ruined.

174
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,850
During our meal, Rashleigh entered.

175
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,929
"I must thank you for calling Mr Campbell.

176
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:54,399
His defence saved me," I said.

177
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,309
I was curious and wanted to learn more about
the connection between Rashleigh and Campbell,

178
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:24,199
so we continued to talk until Diana went to
bed.

179
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:29,759
CHAPTER FOUR
New Troubles

180
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,639
The following day was Sunday, a dull day at
Osbaldistone Hall.

181
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,880
We all attended the formal religious service
in the morning and, when it was over, Sir

182
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,029
Hildebrand congratulated me.

183
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,029
"Ha ha!

184
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:47,029
So you did not go to prison after all, my
lad!

185
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:51,929
You were lucky this time - but do not tempt
Fate again!"

186
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:54,749
His words embarrassed and irritated me.

187
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:57,929
"On my honour, sir!"

188
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:58,929
I replied.

189
00:15:58,929 --> 00:15:59,929
"I am innocent.

190
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:04,290
I was not involved in that detestable crime!"

191
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:09,040
I was saved from more embarrassment by the
arrival of Rashleigh.

192
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,309
He was leaving soon for London and wanted
to know more about my father, his relations

193
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:16,860
with me and about the business.

194
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,360
I, however, was more curious to find out about
Die Vernon.

195
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,540
"We were close friends once and I was her
tutor," he said.

196
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,290
"Then my studies took me far from her.

197
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:37,619
She must now decide between life in a convent
or a convenient marriage.

198
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:41,449
She is engaged to Thorncliff, my brother.

199
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:47,629
But I am convinced that I am better qualified
for her."

200
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:56,199
These words hurt me and that evening, when
I met Die, I was cold and rude to her.

201
00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:03,999
At dinner I drank too much and so I talked
too much, quarrelled and laughed immoderately.

202
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,069
Rapidly I lost all control.

203
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:12,740
It seemed to me that Rashleigh was making
insinuations about my feelings for Die, and,

204
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,189
furious with him, I slapped his face.

205
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:23,929
My cousins took me by force to my room and
locked the door.

206
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:30,770
I slept badly and the next morning I knew
I must apologise for my behaviour.

207
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:37,299
My cousins accepted my excuses - only Rashleigh
showed his resentment.

208
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:42,120
I also apologized to Diana for my discourtesy
to her.

209
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:49,500
She insisted on knowing what had provoked
my bad humour and, embarrassed, I told her.

210
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,530
She answered that I had to be careful when
speaking to Rashleigh.

211
00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:01,080
I decided then that I had to inform my father
about my cousin's true character and wrote

212
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,010
him a letter.

213
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:10,279
It was after this that I realized how much
Miss Vernon and the secrets around her occupied

214
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:15,770
my thoughts - I was falling in love!

215
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:21,679
Rashleigh left the Hall for London and after
his departure I started to help Die with her

216
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,169
studies.

217
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:29,149
I discovered that while she had had an extremely
good education, she was totally ignorant of

218
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:36,529
real life beyond the Hall and knew nothing
of accepted feminine behaviour.

219
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:42,630
One day Andrew Fairservice, the gardener,
informed me that news of the robbery incriminating

220
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,490
me was circulating in London.

221
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:51,450
I was anxious and decided to send another
letter to my father to explain and rode into

222
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,929
town to post it.

223
00:18:52,929 --> 00:19:00,580
At the post office I found a letter from Owen,
my father's clerk, waiting for me.

224
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,970
He said that he was worried because he had
had no recent news from me.

225
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:12,090
He did not mention my previous message concerning
Rashleigh, and so I became suspicious.

226
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,240
"Does someone intercept my letters at Osbaldistone
Hall?"

227
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,600
I wondered.

228
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,860
That evening, when I was in the garden, I
saw a light at the library window.

229
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:31,380
This was not unusual because Diana often read
there alone, but I was surprised when I observed

230
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,880
the shadows of two people inside.

231
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,570
After that I became jealous and started to
watch Miss Vernon's looks and actions.

232
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:48,190
I was desperate to know who visited her in
the library.

233
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:54,390
The next time I saw the light there again,
I ran into the library but I found Diana alone.

234
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,710
However, there was a man's glove on the table.

235
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,220
Diana refused to give me any explanation.

236
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,159
With an air of authority she told me I should
spend my time in a better way, instead of

237
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,230
spying on her.

238
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,559
Then she gave me a letter which had arrived
for me.

239
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,529
"Gracious heaven!"

240
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:17,500
I cried.

241
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,899
"My folly and disobedience have ruined my
father!

242
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:25,090
This letter says that Rashleigh has gone to
Scotland.

243
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:31,309
During my father's absence in Holland, Rashleigh
left London taking documents and large sums

244
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:33,800
of money from the company.

245
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:41,650
Mr Owen is now in Scotland too, in Glasgow,
trying to discover where Rashleigh is hiding."

246
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:47,000
I decided I had to go to Scotland immediately
to help my father's clerk.

247
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,539
Before I left, Diana gave me a sealed packet
without an address, and ordered me to open

248
00:20:53,539 --> 00:21:19,080
it only in an emergency.

249
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,260
CHAPTER FIVE
Reunion with a Friend

250
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:30,960
I asked Andrew Fairservice to accompany me
into Scotland because I did not know the country.

251
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,059
We met at three in the morning because we
didn't want to wake the Osbaldistone family.

252
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:42,429
On a Saturday evening, after a long ride,
we arrived in Glasgow, the principal town

253
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:44,440
in the west of Scotland.

254
00:21:44,440 --> 00:22:00,760
The next morning all the bells of the city
announced the sanctity of the day, Sunday.

255
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,950
I wanted to start looking for Owen immediately,
but Andrew said, "You cannot do anything until

256
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,049
the church service is over."

257
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:19,400
So I decided to go to the cathedral of Glasgow,
a solid and massive example of Gothic architecture.

258
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:25,440
While all the people were silent and listening
to the sermon, a voice from behind me whispered

259
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,799
distinctly in my ear: "You are in danger in
this city!

260
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,000
Meet me tonight at the Brigg at twelve precisely."

261
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,230
I turned round, but there was no one there.

262
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:45,840
I spent the rest of the day at the inn reflecting
on what I should do.

263
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,120
In the end I decided to go to the appointment
on the bridge.

264
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,330
I waited on the bridge in the dark.

265
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,230
I was very apprehensive.

266
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,750
What was going to happen.

267
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:12,660
Then the clock struck midnight, and suddenly
a stranger appeared near me and said, "Mr

268
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,350
Osbaldistone, follow me!"

269
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:21,940
I hesitated and replied, "Can't you give me
your information here?"

270
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,380
"You must receive it from your eyes, not from
my tongue," he said.

271
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,260
"You must follow me, or remain in ignorance."

272
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,740
So I obeyed and was surprised when the man
led me to...

273
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,740
Glasgow prison!

274
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:48,040
The prison guard, a Highlander called Dougal,
seemed happy to see my companion.

275
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,370
He took us upstairs to a cell where a prisoner
was sitting dejected in the corner: it was

276
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,149
Mr Owen!

277
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:01,299
He recognized me and exclaimed, "What!

278
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:02,720
You are here too?

279
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Oh!

280
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,400
Mr Frank, your company is ruined and now you
are in a Scottish prison!

281
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,519
God help us!"

282
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:16,760
I assured him that I was not a prisoner and
asked him to explain what had happened.

283
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,300
What was he doing in Glasgow prison?

284
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:26,019
He told me that my father had two correspondents
for his business in Scotland, the house of

285
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:32,500
MacVittie-MacFin & Co. and the Bailie, Mr
Nicol Jarvie.

286
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,330
They transacted a great deal of business for
the London firm and Owen had gone to see them

287
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,269
when he arrived in the city.

288
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:43,720
"I immediately contacted MacVittie and MacFin,"
said Owen.

289
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:50,100
"They had always professed themselves obliged
and devoted to Mr Osbaldistone, so I openly

290
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,370
revealed the present difficulties of the house
caused by the absence of your father and the

291
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,419
disappearance of Rashleigh.

292
00:24:56,419 --> 00:25:01,330
I asked for counsel and financial assistance
regarding the next payments, but when they

293
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:08,230
discovered they had large credits with Osbaldistone
& Tresham, they refused to help me.

294
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:13,500
They had me arrested and sent to prison as
a debtor instead!"

295
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:19,169
Just then we were interrupted by a loud knocking
on the prison door.

296
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:25,710
A few minutes later, Bailie Jarvie himself
came in and spoke to Owen, asking to see his

297
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,470
papers.

298
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:33,870
He examined them with great attention, then
said, "You owe money to several people in

299
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,300
Glasgow.

300
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,330
But you cannot pay your debts if you are in
prison.

301
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:43,320
I will act as your guarantor and they will
let you go free."

302
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Bailie Jarvie took the lamp and scrutinized
the other people in the room.

303
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
"Ah!

304
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
Eh!

305
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Oh!

306
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,039
My conscience!

307
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,820
It's impossible and yet...

308
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,820
no!

309
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,679
You robber, you devil that you are!

310
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,730
Can this be you, Robin?"

311
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,200
exclaimed the Bailie.

312
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,120
"That is so," was my guide's laconic answer.

313
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:17,360
Mr Jarvie also wanted to know who I was and
then asked me, "Young man, how will you find

314
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,059
the five thousand pounds to pay your father's
bills in three days?"

315
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:28,179
I didn't know what to say, then suddenly I
remembered Diana's packet.

316
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:36,049
I opened the seal and a letter dropped onto
the floor at Mr Jarvie's feet.

317
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:40,590
After examining the name on the envelope,
he gave it to Robin.

318
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:49,130
I realized then that my mysterious guide was
in fact Mr Campbell himself!

319
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:57,010
I recognized his deep voice, his severe face,
and his Scottish accent.

320
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:03,160
Mr Campbell read the letter, then instructed
Owen to remain in Glasgow.

321
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:10,679
He told me Bailie Jarvie and I should go to
his Highland home in the glens.

322
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:16,549
The next day I went to the Bailie's home for
lunch and found Owen there.

323
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:22,669
The honest man was depressed after his stay
in the prison but Mr Jarvie's kind and friendly

324
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:26,919
interest in my fathers affairs consoled him.

325
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:30,350
I asked the Bailie to tell me something about
Robert Campbell.

326
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,980
"He is a distant cousin of mine.

327
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,560
Many people have been cruel to him.

328
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:42,870
He is a Highland cattle merchant that wears
the tartan when he is in the hills and trousers

329
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,789
when he is in Glasgow!"

330
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:48,480
explained the magistrate.

331
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,350
Then he started to examine some business documents
with Owen.

332
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:58,080
As I could not help them, Mr Jarvie suggested
going out for a walk.

333
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:23,799
I could return later for lunch.

334
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:30,789
CHAPTER SIX
An Unexpected Encounter

335
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:34,980
After Mr Jarvie's house, I directed my steps
to the college grounds.

336
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:42,259
While I was walking, my attention was attracted
by three men who appeared at the end of the

337
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:43,860
garden.

338
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:51,169
I looked again and recognized Rashleigh with
Mr Morris and Mr MacVittie!

339
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:56,580
I did not want to be seen, so I hid behind
some trees and came out only when the men

340
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,380
separated.

341
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,289
I followed Rashleigh and took his arm to stop
him.

342
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:08,370
I was determined to demand reparation for
the wrongs done to my father.

343
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:14,509
"I am glad to meet you at last!" were my first
words.

344
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:22,721
"Oh, I am easily found by my friends and more
easily still by my enemies," replied Rashleigh

345
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:23,721
coolly.

346
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:28,139
"Which of the two are you, Mr Francis?"

347
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:36,659
"I will be an enemy, if you do not immediately
render justice to your benefactor, my father,"

348
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:37,850
I said.

349
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:44,009
"Why should I justify my actions to a young
gentleman who has no inclination for business

350
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:45,009
matters?

351
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:50,789
Go, young man, and amuse yourself in the world
of your poetical imagination!"

352
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,350
replied my cousin insolently.

353
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:57,759
"This is no answer for the wrongs done to
my father!

354
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,539
You must come with me to the magistrate and
give me full satisfaction!"

355
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:03,610
I exclaimed, angrily.

356
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,389
"You insulted me once before, remember!"

357
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,450
hissed Rashleigh.

358
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,860
"Your insolence merits personal punishment.

359
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:18,919
Now, follow me to a place where we cannot
be interrupted!"

360
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,620
I followed him, watching him attentively because
I knew that he was treacherous.

361
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:30,539
In fact I had no time to take off my cloak
and take out my sword before he was on me.

362
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:36,290
He attacked me without warning and I only
saved my life by springing back.

363
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,269
Rashleigh fought furiously.

364
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:46,250
After the first impulse of passion, I reflected
that Rashleigh was my cousin, the son of my

365
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,270
uncle, and decided to try and disarm him only.

366
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:55,350
But I soon realized that I had met my match
- the combat seemed destined to have a tragic

367
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,390
end.

368
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:02,769
I slipped, Rashleigh's sword passed through
my waistcoat, grazed my ribs and ran through

369
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:05,029
my coat behind.

370
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:09,919
I thought that I was fatally wounded and assaulted
my opponent, ready now to kill him.

371
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,290
At that moment a man stepped between us and
separated us, exclaiming, "What?

372
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,299
The sons of two brothers doing this!

373
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:21,230
I will break your heads if you continue!"

374
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,720
I looked up in surprise.

375
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,800
The speaker was Mr Campbell.

376
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,460
"Are you hurt, lad?" he asked me.

377
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:35,679
Then, turning to Rashleigh: "Do you think
men will trust their lives and fortunes to

378
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,140
one who goes around quarrelling like a drunk
man?"

379
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:47,010
After a few more quiet words he sent Rashleigh
away and again invited me to be prudent and

380
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,390
to stay at home.

381
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:56,570
Then he disappeared and left me to reflect
upon the singular events of the morning.

382
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:02,970
I tried to adjust my dress and to hide the
blood which was flowing down my right side.

383
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:08,820
On the way to Mr Jarvie's house I stopped
at a little shop, an apothecary's, where a

384
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:15,110
lively, elderly man treated my wound and laughed
at the excuse which I gave him for it.

385
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,110
"Ah!

386
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,110
Young blood!

387
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,249
Young blood!" he repeated.

388
00:32:19,249 --> 00:32:25,470
"What made you so late?" asked Mr Jarvie when
I returned.

389
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:31,260
I made my apologies but did not tell him what
had happened.

390
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,909
Soon we were seated at table where the Bailie
entertained me with great hospitality and

391
00:32:36,909 --> 00:33:03,110
good humour.

392
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:10,210
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Journey Begins

393
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,389
We ended the meal with some brandy-punch.

394
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:21,350
"The limes," Mr Jarvie assured us proudly,
"come from my little farm overseas.

395
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,429
I made the liquor myself!"

396
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:29,960
This led to a conversation between Mr Owen
and our host about the possibility, which

397
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,820
the government had recently given to Scottish
towns, to trade with the British colonies

398
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,179
in America and the West Indies.

399
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:44,710
I was silent and, when the Bailie questioned
me, I related the events of the morning and

400
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:52,269
anxiously asked him, "What should I do to
help my father and satisfy my own honour?"

401
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:56,260
"I think that Robin will help you, if he can.

402
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,870
He is a good-hearted man," replied the Bailie.

403
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:04,519
"Can I consider Mr Campbell an honest man?"

404
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:05,519
I continued.

405
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:14,500
"Can I go to the appointment in the glens
safely, and believe in a man who fears justice?"

406
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:21,099
Mr Jarvie explained that in the Highlands
there was no law and no magistrates.

407
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:26,970
The country was savage and poor, and people
often became bandits.

408
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:33,079
Robin Campbell, once an honest and active
man of noble lineage, became an outlaw, known

409
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,980
as Rob Roy, when his creditors took everything
he had.

410
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,149
Here Mr Jarvie's face became very sad.

411
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:48,579
"Rob was away on business," he said, "and
when he came home, he found desolation where

412
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:59,090
he had left plenty; he looked east, west,
south, north and he saw no hope, no shelter!"

413
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:04,210
The Bailies voice showed his affection and
sympathy for Campbell's misfortunes.

414
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:11,770
"Robin put on his bonnet, took his big sword
and collected a band of blue bonnets.

415
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:17,569
He and his men started to protect the lands
and cattle of the southern farmers from robbers,

416
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:19,619
in exchange for money."

417
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:24,829
"Oh, a very singular contract of insurance!

418
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:29,090
The robbers who threaten the southern farmers
are those same Highlanders!"

419
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:33,000
exclaimed Owen at this point.

420
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,109
This form of blackmail was against the law,
and Rob risked capture and death if he was

421
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:40,650
found in Glasgow.

422
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,839
"He is a sort of Robin Hood!"

423
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,250
concluded the Bailie.

424
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:50,960
"I am convinced that he robbed Morris with
the help of Rashleigh to accelerate the Jacobite

425
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,500
rebellion against King George.

426
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,680
He was certainly an agent between our Highland,
chiefs and the gentlemen in the north of England."

427
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,460
The conversation went on, and gradually we
came to the opinion that I should leave at

428
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,940
once for the glens and meet Rob Roy there.

429
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:14,740
The next morning at five o'clock we started
our journey.

430
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:20,170
Mr Owen remained in Glasgow and Andrew came
with us.

431
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:26,930
We travelled all day, going north-east from
Glasgow - first across a marshy barren land,

432
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:33,609
then through a wild and desolate area with
dark blue mountains visible in the distance.

433
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:37,920
I began to appreciate Mr Jarvie.

434
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,280
He had an observant mind and he knew the ancient
history of the area.

435
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,960
He was a good Scotsman that loved the traditions
of his land, but he also understood the importance

436
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:57,300
of the union with England for the future prosperity
of his town and country.

437
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,900
We had lunch at noon at a most miserable alehouse,
and then continued our journey quickly because

438
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,960
we wanted to reach the clachan of Aberfoil
before night fell.

439
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,210
During the last three miles Mr Jarvie began
to give Andrew his instructions.

440
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:22,230
"Keep your tongue in your mouth, and don't
say a word, good or bad, to anyone in the

441
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,440
clacham!" he told him sharply.

442
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,680
"And... remember, no blasting about your master's
name - or mine!"

443
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,690
"I have many things of more importance to
speak about!"

444
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:59,619
was Andrew's indignant reply.

445
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:05,130
CHAPTER EIGHT
In the Highlands

446
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,359
At last we arrived at the inn at Aberfoil.

447
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:15,340
There was a willow-branch across the half-opened
door, blocking our entrance.

448
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:20,790
Mr Jarvie told me that this meant there were
some Highland chiefs inside who did not want

449
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,140
to be disturbed.

450
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,869
After some discussion with the landlady we
were allowed to enter.

451
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:35,250
Inside the inn was a large, bare room full
of smoke, with a big fire blazing merrily

452
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,250
in the centre.

453
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:42,310
Three men were sitting at an old, scratched
oak table near the fire.

454
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,890
Two looked like Highlanders, judging by their
clothes.

455
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:52,770
The third was in the Lowlands dress and looked
like a soldier.

456
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:58,520
Another Highlander, all covered up by a plaid,
was sleeping on the floor.

457
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,890
It seemed that they did not pay any attention
to us but when I ordered some food, one of

458
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,460
them said to me in very good English,

459
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,160
"You think you are at home here, I see!"

460
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,290
His tone was offensive and a dispute started.

461
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:18,690
In a few moments we were fighting - three
against three I thought, but then I noticed

462
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,270
that Andrew had vanished.

463
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:26,560
The Bailie started well but he was corpulent
and soon exhausted his energy.

464
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,450
He was almost at die mercy of his antagonist,
when suddenly the sleeping Highlander jumped

465
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:38,330
up from his place on the floor and, placing
himself between the two men, exclaimed, "This

466
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,550
is Bailie Jarvie!

467
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,650
I will defend him!"

468
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:47,400
At these words, with the cry "Hold your hands,
hold your hands!", the fight stopped and we

469
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,420
all sat down together and drank in friendship.

470
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,859
Supper was nearly ready so I went to look
for Andrew.

471
00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:02,750
The landlady offered to guide me to the stable
with a light and, when we were outside, she

472
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,170
gave me a piece of paper.

473
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:08,589
It was a message from Robin Campbell.

474
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:13,360
He said that he could not come to the meeting,
and advised me not to mix with the people

475
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,610
at the inn because they were dangerous.

476
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:24,980
After looking for him everywhere finally discovered
Andrew in the stable, hiding in a corner.

477
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:30,049
He was frightened and continued repeating:
"I am an honest lad, sir!

478
00:40:30,049 --> 00:40:31,160
I am!

479
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,410
I am!"

480
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:37,960
I requested an explanation and eventually
he told me that he thought I was putting myself

481
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,619
in extreme danger.

482
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:42,329
"Take care of yourself, sir!

483
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:48,430
Don't go near Rob Roy!" he said with sincere
alarm.

484
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:55,010
We went back into the inn and found that Bailie
Jarvie was now quarrelling with the tall Highlander.

485
00:40:55,010 --> 00:41:03,110
Then we heard the measured steps of soldiers,
some orders were shouted outside, and an officer

486
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:06,569
wearing a red coat came into the room.

487
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:08,930
He looked severe.

488
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,619
He addressed the three men.

489
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:13,240
"I am Captain Thornton.

490
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,940
You are, I suppose, the Major and the Highland
gentlemen I had to meet in this place?"

491
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,300
They nodded in agreement.

492
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:25,890
Then, pointing to us, he continued, "Are these
gentlemen with your group?

493
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:32,349
I have orders to arrest an old person and
a young one - as traitors!"

494
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:35,650
He looked hard at Mr Jarvie and me.

495
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,850
"You two!

496
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,250
What are your names?"

497
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:45,160
Mr Jarvie told him and when the officer heard
the name Osbaldistone he ordered his soldiers

498
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,390
to disarm and search me.

499
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:54,319
They found the note from Mr Campbell, and
decided that we had to be Rob Roy's spies.

500
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:59,819
The officer decided to send us to the garrison
with an escort.

501
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:02,190
We spent the rest of the night at the inn.

502
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,230
I did not sleep well.

503
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:10,470
I heard the soldiers going out many times
on patrol, but apparently they did not find

504
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:27,640
out the information the English officer wanted
because he became more nervous each time they

505
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:39,240
returned!

506
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,890
CHAPTER NINE
A Memorable Woman

507
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:49,280
Early the next morning some soldiers ran into
the inn.

508
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,329
They were dragging a Highlander triumphantly.

509
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:59,430
I immediately recognized him - it was the
prison guardian, Dougal, the very man who

510
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,380
had defended Mr Jarvie!

511
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:06,869
The Bailie recognized him too and exclaimed,
"Mercy on us!

512
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:09,690
They have taken that poor creature, Dougal!

513
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,250
Captain, I will give you money for his liberty!"

514
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,920
The officer, however, paid no attention to
the Bailie's request.

515
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,720
Instead he started to question Dougal.

516
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,290
He forced the Highlander to admit, with great
reluctance and after many contradictions,

517
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:32,450
that he knew Rob Roy MacGregor Campbell and
that he had seen him only an hour before.

518
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:39,059
"And now, my friend," said the officer, "you
will please tell me how many men your master

519
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:41,500
has with him at present."

520
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:47,030
Dougal looked away and replied slowly that
he did not know.

521
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,040
"Look at me, you Highland dog!"

522
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,490
the officer threatened showing him a rope.

523
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:58,150
"I'll hang you from the nearest tree if you
do not take us to Rob Roy's hiding place!"

524
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:02,030
The soldiers got ready to move and we left
the inn.

525
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:06,829
I was glad to be outside in the refreshing
fragrance of the morning air.

526
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:13,859
I liked the woods around me, the mountain
lake in the distance, the romantic solitude

527
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:20,799
of the place where a man alone seemed to be
in a state of inferiority.

528
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:27,190
At one point the roadwe were following suddenly
emerged from the forest and started to follow

529
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,940
the shore of the lake.

530
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:38,320
It gradually became narrow and steep, the
ideal place for an ambush.

531
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,010
Suddenly a woman appeared on the summit of
a rock above us.

532
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,010
"Stop!"

533
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,970
she cried in a commanding tone.

534
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:49,110
"What are you doing in MacGregor's country?"

535
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:52,170
She was an imposing woman of about fifty.

536
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:58,430
Her face, once beautiful, was expressive but
now full of lines.

537
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:04,339
She wore a plaid wrapped around her body,
as Highland soldiers do, and a man's bonnet

538
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:06,010
with a feather.

539
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:11,020
She was also carrying a sword in her hand,
and had a pair of pistols in her belt.

540
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:14,600
"We are looking for Rob Roy MacGregor Campbell!"

541
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,799
replied the officer.

542
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:17,750
"Let us pass!

543
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:22,250
We don't want to fight against a woman, we
offer you civil treatment!"

544
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,630
"Ah!" shouted the woman.

545
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,089
"I know your civil treatment!

546
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:32,422
You have left me and mine no house and no
bed, no cattle and no clothes!

547
00:45:32,422 --> 00:45:35,750
And now you come for our lives!"

548
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,470
"That's Helen Campbell, Robs wife!"

549
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,660
whispered the Bailie to me.

550
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,579
Suddenly the officer gave the order for the
soldiers to charge.

551
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:54,760
Guns flashed from various parts of the pass
and three red-coats were killed.

552
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:00,190
The captain prepared a second attack against
the Highlanders, and Dougal, no longer under

553
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:05,160
escort, escaped from his captors and began
to ascend the mountainside with incredible

554
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,290
agility.

555
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:14,450
I followed his example while the fire and
the grenades exploded and hissed behind me,

556
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:18,109
and I continued climbing until I was out of
breath.

557
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,940
Then I stopped and looked down.

558
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:26,930
I saw the Bailie hanging in mid-air from the
branch of a thorn tree.

559
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:32,950
Andrew was on the top of a rock, exposed to
all dangers, and was crying for mercy alternately

560
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,670
in Gaelic and English.

561
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:40,450
In spite of the danger the scene was very
comical!

562
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:43,790
After a few minutes the guns stopped.

563
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:48,530
Some of the soldiers were lying lifeless on
the ground, the rest were in the hands of

564
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,369
the Highlanders.

565
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:55,579
I realized then for sure that Dougal was not
a traitor.

566
00:46:55,579 --> 00:47:01,240
He had given false information to the officer
to guide the soldiers into the ambush because

567
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:31,680
he wanted to protect Mr Campbell, alias Robert
MacGregor, alias Rob Roy!

568
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:37,099
CHAPTER TEN
Captured!

569
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:42,349
The Bailie and Andrew were soon treed from
their uncomfortable position, and I joined

570
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:43,349
them.

571
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:49,369
Dougal came to our help, and took us to Rob
Roy's wife.

572
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:55,359
Helen MacGregor Campbell had not personally
taken part in the fight, but her aspect was

573
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:03,350
menacing: her hands and arms were naked, her
face and sword were stained with blood, her

574
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:10,110
hair was in a disorderly state, her eyes were
inflamed by the triumph of victory.

575
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,559
She looked like a biblical heroine.

576
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,420
"I am very happy to have this joyful opportunity,"
said the Bailie.

577
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,810
"Do you remember me, Mrs MacGregor Campbell.

578
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:25,980
I am your cousin, Nicol Jarvie, son of Deacon
Jarvie."

579
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,650
He explained the connection between their
two families, and talked of the times when

580
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:35,380
Rob Roy had still been an honest cattle merchant.

581
00:48:35,380 --> 00:49:02,880
We were interrupted by the melancholy sound
of bagpipes.

582
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,640
Rob Roy's two sons arrived and I looked at
them with interest.

583
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,280
The two boys were young - hardly twenty.

584
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:19,339
The elder, Hamish, or James in English, was
tall, fair and handsome, with blue eyes and

585
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:23,869
a profusion of blond hair under his blue bonnet.

586
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:31,869
The younger, Robert, or Oig in the language
of the Highlanders, had dark hair and a dark

587
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:32,869
complexion.

588
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:38,130
He was a stout, strong boy, a real Highlander.

589
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:45,349
They brought bad news, however - their father
had been captured and was now a prisoner of

590
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,680
the English troops!

591
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,010
But Helen MacGregor did not weep at their
news.

592
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:52,600
Instead she shouted at them furiously:

593
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,600
"Your father taken?

594
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,600
A prisoner?

595
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,600
And you, you are still alive!

596
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:01,480
Better that you had died protecting him!"

597
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:08,480
Rob Roys sons stood in front of their mother
and listened to her reproaching words silently.

598
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,320
Their faces showed pain and shame.

599
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:18,970
She asked what had happened and Hamish told
her how his father had fallen into a trap.

600
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:25,339
He spoke in a low tone of voice and he spoke
in English, probably because he did not want

601
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:32,700
his followers to understand, but I was very
near them and I could hear his story.

602
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:38,910
A man had brought Rob Roy a message from a
person whose name I could not hear.

603
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:44,020
Rob Roy had left with three men but only one
of them had come back.

604
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:49,000
"The man that brought the message is our hostage
now," Hamish continued.

605
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,480
"We can try to exchange him for our father."

606
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:59,300
Helen asked to see him mid they brought forward
a man half dead with terror.

607
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:07,910
Imagine my great surprise-when I recognized
him - he was my old acquaintance, Mr Morris.

608
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:13,650
He fell on the ground before Helen MacGregor
and implored her to spare his life.

609
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:20,640
"I was totally ignorant of any design on the
person of Rob Roy, a man I honour and love.

610
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,680
I was sent by Rashleigh with a message for
MacGregor, but I did not know of the plot

611
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,539
against him."

612
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:31,549
But the woman was not moved by his words.

613
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:37,660
"Life is a heavy burden for me, for you it
is enjoyment.

614
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,540
This enjoyment must end.

615
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,260
You shall die, miserable dog!"

616
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:48,000
she said, and gave a brief command to her
attendants.

617
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,799
Two Highlanders came and dragged Morris to
a cliff over the lake.

618
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:59,220
He struggled and shouted while they tied a
rock around his neck and took off some of

619
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:05,130
his clothes.

620
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:10,690
His cries were terrible, I still remember
them.

621
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:17,720
He looked at me and begged for my help, and
I tried to speak on his behalf, but my words

622
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,980
were vain.

623
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,690
They threw him into the cold, deep water.

624
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,230
We were horrified.

625
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:34,609
Bailie Jarvie protested, "That was a cruel,
unnecessary murder!" he declared.

626
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:41,289
Helen MacGregor pretended not to hear, but
turned to me and asked, "Are you Rashleigh

627
00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:42,289
Osbaldistone?

628
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:45,319
I heard Morris call you Osbaldistone."

629
00:52:45,319 --> 00:52:49,710
"No, my name is Francis Osbaldistone," I replied.

630
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:53,760
"Do you know this Rashleigh? is he a relative
of yours?"

631
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,110
she continued.

632
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,250
I answered that I knew him.

633
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:00,880
"Then you will go to the garrison with a message,"
she told me.

634
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,490
"If they don't free Rob Roy MacGregor in twelve
hours, we will send back all our prisoners

635
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,799
cut into pieces."

636
00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:14,710
A few minutes later I left for the garrison.

637
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:22,780
The commanding officer read the letter I gave
him and gave me his reply: "Rob Roy must die."

638
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:29,240
He showed no interest whatsoever in the prisoners'
lives and ordered the cavalry troops to prepare

639
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:58,240
to leave, escorting Rob Roy and the English
prisoner - that is to say, me.

640
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:06,220
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Where Is Rob Roy?

641
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:10,040
We travelled surrounded by armed soldiers.

642
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:18,700
Rob Roy was on a horse tied with a horse-belt
to a very big, strong Scotsman called Ewan.

643
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:24,760
When we were near the river, Rob Roy whispered
to Ewan, "It is sad to see a Scotsman who

644
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:30,780
considers an English captains orders more
important than a friend's life."

645
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:39,750
In the middle of the river I heard a splash
and immediately understood - Rob Roy's words

646
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:44,680
had convinced Ewan to free him and give him
the chance to live.

647
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,420
He had jumped off the horse into the water!

648
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,369
The captain also heard the sound and guessed
what had happened.

649
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:54,549
"You dogs!" he cried.

650
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:56,630
"Where is the prisoner?

651
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,069
Go and look for him!

652
00:54:58,069 --> 00:55:01,690
I promise a hundred guineas as a reward!"

653
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,720
There was great confusion.

654
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,609
Some soldiers tried to follow the fugitive
into the water, but the force of the current

655
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:10,119
carried them away.

656
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:16,640
Others, who were more cautious, galloped along
the riverbanks, shooting and shouting.

657
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:24,270
Escape for Rob Roy was not difficult - he
was an expert swimmer.

658
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:30,200
At first he was confused under the water but
then he freed himself from his plaid, swam

659
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,230
away under the surface and was soon out of
view.

660
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:41,750
The soldiers saw the plaid in the water and
tried to catch it but they soon gave up.

661
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:48,050
In many places the river was inaccessible
because of the thick vegetation and besides,

662
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:53,910
it was getting dark, so it was not easy to
see anything in the water.

663
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:58,290
Most of them believed that Rob would not be
able to survive the current and the freezing

664
00:55:58,290 --> 00:55:59,880
water.

665
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,790
At last the sound of a trumpet announced the
retreat.

666
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:12,440
Up to that moment, I had been a spectator
- like someone watching a hunting scene at

667
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,510
Osbaldistone Hall.

668
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:19,599
But suddenly I heard a voice call out "Where
is the Englishman.

669
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,599
He gave Rob Roy the knife to cut the belt.

670
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:24,650
We must kill him!"

671
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:28,620
And I realized then the danger of my situation.

672
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:33,569
I jumped from my horse and ran into a wood
where the darkness of the night protected

673
00:56:33,569 --> 00:56:35,130
my escape.

674
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:40,150
I decided I had to try somehow to return to
Aberfoil.

675
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:44,210
Eventually I found my way back to the road.

676
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:50,770
While I was walking, lost in my thoughts,
a horseman approached me and asked me if the

677
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,270
road was safe.

678
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:58,630
I replied that it was not and then noticed
his companion.

679
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:04,559
Both of them were wrapped in travelling cloaks
and the hood of the man's cloak hid his face,

680
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:10,890
but his companion was not wearing a hood,
only a small hat, and in the dark her figure

681
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:14,170
seemed familiar.

682
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:18,599
She addressed me in a familiar voice, saying
my name.

683
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:25,470
My blood froze in surprise: it was Diana Vernon's
voice!

684
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:30,720
But the man with her prevented any further
conversation saying in a commanding tone,

685
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,660
"Give him his property!"

686
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:40,540
Diana gave me a small case and said, "Rashleigh
had to abandon your father's papers.

687
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,030
Here they are.

688
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,670
Now, we must part forever.

689
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,819
Farewell, dear Frank."

690
00:57:48,819 --> 00:57:59,630
Then she galloped away with the unknown man.

691
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:05,010
I was deeply sad, but I continued on my way.

692
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:07,990
After a while another voice addressed me.

693
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:14,170
"Good night, Mr Osbaldistone."

694
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:18,059
There was no doubt: it was Rob Roy.

695
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:23,000
He had escaped his enemies and had acquired
a musket and other Highland weapons since

696
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,730
his escape at the river.

697
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:30,910
I welcomed him, and he asked me about the
events of the preceding day.

698
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:36,100
I told him about the ambush at the lake and
the meeting with Diana Vernon.

699
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:41,230
I was jealous and wanted to know the name
of the man accompanying her.

700
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,779
Did he know?

701
00:58:43,779 --> 00:58:51,550
Rob called him ''His Excellency", but he was
so vague that I continued to ask myself, is

702
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:55,250
he Diana's husband?"

703
00:58:55,250 --> 00:59:01,340
Suddenly three Highlanders appeared in front
of us on the road and commanded us to stop.

704
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:07,150
Rob said the word Gregaragh, his name in Gaelic,
and they cheered us.

705
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:12,109
They were relieved to see that their chief
was safe.

706
00:59:12,109 --> 00:59:18,260
We arrived at Aberfoil together where we met
Jarvie, who was waiting for us.

707
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:24,890
The following day Rob Roy MacGregor accompanied
us to Loch Lomond, where we could take a boat

708
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:27,040
to Glasgow.

709
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:33,950
As we rode he told me, "We Highlanders are
rude and ignorant, we are also violent and

710
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:37,640
passionate, but we are not cruel.

711
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,160
We are a persecuted generation.

712
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,690
We do not want to go against the laws of the
country, but people do not permit us to live

713
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:49,250
in peace - so, we must fight."

714
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:55,340
He then explained that Rashleigh had been
obliged to give back my father's papers.

715
00:59:55,340 --> 01:00:00,750
He had gone to Stirling and informed the authorities
that the Highlanders were preparing a rebellion

716
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,920
against King George.

717
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,640
While he was speaking, Helen and his two sons
arrived.

718
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:13,490
"You are welcome," she said, looking at me
and at the Bailie.

719
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:16,260
"Excuse my previous rudeness.

720
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,349
We live in bad times!"

721
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:20,789
and she gave me a ring.

722
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:27,530
It was one of Dianas rings - a farewell present,
Helen said.

723
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:30,710
A boat was waiting for us.

724
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:38,599
We parted from Rob Roy with many manifestations
of affection while the bagpipes sounded their

725
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:51,099
melancholy notes.

726
01:00:51,099 --> 01:00:57,119
He remained watching us for some time, standing
on a rock at the side of the loch with his

727
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:03,089
long gun, his tartan and the single feather
in his cap.

728
01:01:03,089 --> 01:01:28,690
Then he vanished.

729
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:36,000
CHAPTER TWELVE
The Tables Are Turned

730
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,350
That same night we reached Glasgow.

731
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:45,730
I returned to my inn, where Andrew himself
came to open the door.

732
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:50,980
Owen appeared behind him with another man
- it was my father!

733
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:56,700
"My dear, dear son!" he said, embracing me.

734
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,920
We were overjoyed to see one another.

735
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,500
He told me that he had come to Scotland to
capture Rashleigh and to put his affairs in

736
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,860
order.

737
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:13,390
My father asked Bailie Jarvie to be his firm's
correspondent in Glasgow and we decided to

738
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:16,150
return to London.

739
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:22,410
On the morning of our departure, Andrew Fairservice
came to my room like a mad man, jumping up

740
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:27,839
and down with excitement and told me that
the long-awaited rebellion of the Highlanders

741
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,569
in favour of the Old Pretender, King James,
was beginning.

742
01:02:33,569 --> 01:02:38,090
Rob Roy and his men were on their way to Glasgow!

743
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:45,190
In the troubled times that followed my Osbaldistone
cousins fought for the Jacobite cause and,

744
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:49,059
one after the other, all perished.

745
01:02:49,059 --> 01:02:54,180
My uncle, Sir Hildebrand, passed away in a
Hanoverian prison.

746
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,230
They say he died of sorrow.

747
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:04,090
After his death I learned from Judge Inglewood
that Sir Hildebrand had left all his property

748
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:08,310
to me in the event of his sons' deaths.

749
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:14,089
He had cancelled Rashleigh from his will because
of his support of the Hanoverians, whom my

750
01:03:14,089 --> 01:03:15,790
uncle hated.

751
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:23,339
I was now the heir to Osbaldistone Hall - I
had inherited everything!

752
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:29,990
The judge also revealed to me that the man
they called "His Excellency" was really Diana's

753
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:33,450
father, Sir Frederick Vernon.

754
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:40,230
He had lived in secret at Osbaldistone Hall
for many years and only Sir Hildebrand, Diana

755
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:43,440
and Rashleigh knew his secret.

756
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:49,089
I was shocked to hear this information but
at the same time I was pleased.

757
01:03:49,089 --> 01:03:57,789
The strange man Diana often met in the library
was her father, not her husband - she wasn't

758
01:03:57,789 --> 01:04:01,790
married after all!

759
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:06,539
The next morning I set out for Osbaldistone
Hall with Andrew.

760
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:11,779
When we arrived, the house had a very different
aspect from the last time I had seen it.

761
01:04:11,779 --> 01:04:18,240
It was silent and solitary, the doors and
windows were closed, the grass in the courtyards

762
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:25,299
was long, the gardens neglected - a sharp
contrast to the lively, bustling atmosphere

763
01:04:25,299 --> 01:04:28,200
of some months ago.

764
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:34,700
Andrew knocked at every door of the building
and finally my uncle's ancient major-domo,

765
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,589
appeared.

766
01:04:37,589 --> 01:04:43,200
He seemed very agitated and, when I asked
him to light a fire in the library, he was

767
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,680
reluctant.

768
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,559
I soon understood why!

769
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:55,099
As I waited there, I heard a deep sigh behind
me and turned to see Diana Vernon standing

770
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,769
there with her father.

771
01:04:56,769 --> 01:05:02,480
"We beg you to help us, Mr Osbaldistone,"
Sir Frederick said.

772
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,609
"To give us refuge.

773
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:09,839
I am a convinced Catholic, I took part in
the rebellion in favour of King James, but

774
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,920
I was obliged to flee.

775
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,970
I am hiding here at Osbaldistone Hall with
my daughter, waiting for a boat to take us

776
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:19,250
to the Continent."

777
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:25,510
I invited them to remain for as long as they
needed but I was very agitated.

778
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:33,680
That night there was a violent knocking at
the gate - there were soldiers outside.

779
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,470
They demanded to enter.

780
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:40,309
They had orders to arrest Sir Vernon on a
charge of treason.

781
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:42,210
Diana appeared beside me.

782
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:46,039
She whispered "Danger is familiar to us, Frank.

783
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:47,579
Don't be afraid.

784
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:51,980
We will escape into the garden and then into
the wood.

785
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:56,289
Dear, dear Frank, farewell!"

786
01:05:56,289 --> 01:05:58,800
I heard Andrew shouting.

787
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:05,310
With the soldiers there was a magistrate with
a legal mandate accompanied by - Rashleigh!

788
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:12,119
They went at once to the library but it was
already empty - Diana and her father had fled.

789
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:16,869
They ran into the gardens and caught the fugitives
at the gate.

790
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:23,411
It seemed all was lost but then, as the escort
party was leaving with their prisoners, they

791
01:06:23,411 --> 01:06:25,299
found a barricade at the Hall gates.

792
01:06:25,299 --> 01:06:31,329
A group of Highlanders barred the way with
their cattle.

793
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:35,810
Rashleigh's men were trying to drive the cattle
away, when suddenly the leader of the Highlanders

794
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:38,220
cried "Claymore!"

795
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,859
It was an ambush prepared by Rob Roy!

796
01:06:40,859 --> 01:06:43,660
There was a desperate fight.

797
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:46,960
The soldiers fled and Rashleigh was badly
wounded.

798
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:53,190
"Ask pardon for your treason in the name of
God, King James and our old friendship," cried

799
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:56,599
Rob Roy, his sword at Rashleigh's throat.

800
01:06:56,599 --> 01:06:57,789
"Never!"

801
01:06:57,789 --> 01:07:00,059
replied Rashleigh, firmly.

802
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:03,750
"Then, traitor, die for your treason!"

803
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:08,069
cried Rob and passed his sword through his
enemy's body.

804
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:11,619
He was still breathing when we brought him
to the Hall.

805
01:07:11,619 --> 01:07:19,089
His last words were for me: "The pangs of
death do not alter my feelings towards you,

806
01:07:19,089 --> 01:07:26,280
Frank Osbaldistone - I hate you with an immense
hatred!"

807
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:30,869
And then he died.

808
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:35,260
Diana and her father escaped and took the
boat to France.

809
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:39,930
I returned to London to work in my fathers
company.

810
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:46,960
After some time, my anxiety to learn the fate
of Miss Vernon became acute and I embarked

811
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,660
for France.

812
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:55,809
There, after many adventures, I found her
