1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:07,939
When you are aged about five or six; you are
the most important person in your world and,

2
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:15,150
naturally, you expect your parents to understand
this and to follow your wishes in everything.

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:45,739
But young Larry has a lot of trouble getting
his parents to behave in the right way...

4
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:51,829
Father was in the army all through the war
- the First World War, I mean - so up to the

5
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:58,270
age of five, I never saw much of him, and
what I saw did not worry me.

6
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,789
Sometimes I woke and there was a big figure
in uniform staring down at me.

7
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:09,390
Sometimes in the early morning, I heard the
front door bang and heavy footsteps marching

8
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,659
away down the street.

9
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,610
These were Father's entrances and exits.

10
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,150
Like Santa Claus, he came and went mysteriously.

11
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:27,180
In fact, I rather liked his visits, although
there wasn't much room between Mother and

12
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,340
him when I got into the big bed in the early
morning.

13
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,659
He smoked a pipe, which gave him a pleasant
smell, and shaved, an interesting activity

14
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,990
I had never seen before.

15
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:47,430
Each time he left a few more souvenirs behind
- buttons and knives and used bullets - packed

16
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,500
carefully away in a box.

17
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,170
When he was away, Mother used to let me play
with these things.

18
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,610
She didn't seem to think as highly of them
as he did.

19
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,030
The war was the most peaceful time of my life.

20
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,840
The window of my room faced southeast.

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,180
I always woke at first light, and felt I was
rather like the sun, ready to light up the

22
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,010
world and be happy.

23
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:22,370
Life never seemed so simple and clear and
full of possibilities as then.

24
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:28,849
I put my feet out from under the blankets
- I called them Mrs Left and Mrs Right - and

25
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,800
invented situations for them.

26
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,260
They discussed what Mother and I should do
during the day, what Santa Claus should give

27
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,370
me for Christmas, and what steps should be
taken to brighten the home.

28
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,919
There was that little matter of the baby,
for example.

29
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,209
Mother and I could never agree about that.

30
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:57,139
Ours was the only house in the road without
a new baby, and Mother said we couldn't afford

31
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:01,400
one until Father came back from the war, because
they were expensive.

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,489
That showed how silly she was being.

33
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:12,529
The Geneys up the road had a new baby, and
everyone knew they didn't have much money.

34
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:18,459
It was probably a cheap baby, and Mother wanted
something really good, but I felt she was

35
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:19,749
being too choosy.

36
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:24,840
The Geneys' baby would have been fine for
us.

37
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,760
Having arranged my plans for the day, I got
up, went into Mother's room and climbed into

38
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,750
the big bed.

39
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,540
She woke and I began to tell her what I had
decided.

40
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:44,209
The bed was so nice and warm that I usually
fell asleep beside her, and woke again only

41
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:49,709
when I heard her below in the kitchen, making
the breakfast.

42
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:56,889
After breakfast, we went into town, said a
prayer for Father at the church, and did the

43
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:57,889
shopping.

44
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:03,419
Mother had all her friends praying for Father,
and every night, before going to bed, I asked

45
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,329
God to send him back safe from the war to
us.

46
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:11,079
It's a pity I didn't know what I was praying
for!

47
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,949
One morning I got into the big bed, and there,
sure enough, was Father.

48
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:20,810
As usual, he'd arrived like Santa Claus.

49
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,580
But later he put on his best blue suit instead
of his uniform, and Mother looked very pleased.

50
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:34,510
I saw nothing to be pleased about, because,
out of uniform, Father was far less interesting.

51
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:41,129
But she only gave a big smile and explained
that our prayers had been answered.

52
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:46,400
We all went off to church to thank God for
bringing Father safely home.

53
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,210
Well, I couldn't believe what happened next.

54
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:58,370
When we came back, he sat down and began to
talk seriously to Mother, who looked anxious.

55
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,699
Naturally, I disliked her looking anxious,
because it destroyed her good looks, so I

56
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,770
interrupted him.

57
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,300
'Just a moment, Larry!'

58
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,169
she said gently.

59
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:14,560
But when I went on talking, she said impatiently,
'Do be quiet, Larry!

60
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,569
Don't you hear me talking to Daddy?'

61
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:24,740
This was the first time I had heard these
awful words, 'talking to Daddy', and I couldn't

62
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,130
help feeling that if this was how God answered
prayers, he wasn't listening to them very

63
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,439
carefully.

64
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,000
'Why are you talking to Daddy?'

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,940
I asked.

66
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,590
'Because Daddy and I have business to discuss.

67
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,509
Now don't interrupt again!'

68
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:48,050
In the afternoon, at Mother's request, Father
took me for a walk.

69
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,650
I discovered that he and I had quite different
ideas of what a walk in town should be.

70
00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:01,080
He had no interest in trains, ships, or horses,
and the only thing he seemed to enjoy was

71
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,499
talking to men as old as himself.

72
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:10,509
When I wanted to stop, he simply went on,
dragging me behind him by the hand; when he

73
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:14,689
wanted to stop, I was forced to stop too.

74
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:19,970
I tried pulling him by the coat and trousers,
but he was amazingly good at paying no attention

75
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,970
to me.

76
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,249
Really, it was like going for a walk with
a mountain!

77
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:32,050
At teatime, 'talking to Daddy' began again,
made worse by the fact that he now had an

78
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,440
evening newspaper.

79
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,479
Every few minutes he told Mother some news
out of it.

80
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,110
I didn't feel this was fair.

81
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,199
I was ready to do battle with him any time
for Mother's attention, but using other people's

82
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,230
ideas gave him an unfair advantage.

83
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,740
Several times, I tried to talk about something
else, but with no success.

84
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:01,180
'You must be quiet while Daddy's reading,
Larry,' Mother said.

85
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,900
It was clear that either she really liked
talking to Father better than talking to me,

86
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,979
or else he had some terrible power over her.

87
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:18,800
'Mummy,' I said that night in bed, 'do you
think, if I prayed hard, God would send Daddy

88
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,550
back to the war?'

89
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,370
'No, dear,' she said with a smile.

90
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,380
'I don't think he would.'

91
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,439
'Why wouldn't he, Mummy?'

92
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:31,610
'Because there isn't a war any longer, dear.'

93
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,500
'But, Mummy, couldn't God make another war?'

94
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,259
'He wouldn't like to, dear.

95
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:42,800
It's not God who makes wars - it's bad people
who do it.'

96
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,120
'Oh!'

97
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,180
I said, disappointed.

98
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:53,760
I began to think that God wasn't quite as
wonderful as people said he was.

99
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,910
Next morning I woke at my usual hour, feeling
ready to burst with ideas and plans for the

100
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:00,910
day.

101
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,660
I put out my feet and invented a long conversation.

102
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:11,690
Mrs Right talked of the trouble she had with
her own father until she put him in the Home.

103
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:17,250
I didn't quite know what the Home was, but
it sounded the right place for Father.

104
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:23,379
Then I got up, went into the next room and
in the half-darkness climbed into the big

105
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,430
bed.

106
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,770
Father was taking up more than his fair share
of the bed, so I gave him several kicks.

107
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,199
Mother woke and put out a hand to me.

108
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:40,419
I lay comfortably in the warmth of the bed
with my thumb in my mouth.

109
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,419
'Mummy!'

110
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,269
I said loudly and happily.

111
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:44,850
'Sssh, dear!'

112
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,089
she whispered.

113
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,139
'Don't wake Daddy!'

114
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:58,149
This was a new development, which threatened
to be even more serious than 'talking to Daddy'.

115
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,649
Life without my early-morning discussions
was unthinkable.

116
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:04,010
'Why?'

117
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,889
I asked crossly.

118
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:07,540
'Because poor Daddy is tired.'

119
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,779
This seemed to me a very poor reason.

120
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,000
'Oh!'

121
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,490
I said lightly.

122
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,250
'Do you know where I want to go with you today,
Mummy?'

123
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,380
'No, dear,' she sighed.

124
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,280
'I want to go to the river to catch some fish,
and then-'

125
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,680
'Don't-wake-Daddy!'

126
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,910
she whispered angrily, holding her hand across
my mouth.

127
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,649
But it was too late.

128
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:35,380
He was awake.

129
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:42,540
He reached for his matches, lit one and stared
in horror at his watch.

130
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,329
'Like a cup of tea, dear?' asked Mother nervously.

131
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,959
'Tea?' he cried angrily.

132
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,220
'Do you know what the time is?'

133
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:59,329
'And after that I want to go up the Rathcooney
Road,' I said loudly, afraid I'd forget something

134
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:00,930
in all these interruptions.

135
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,529
'Go to sleep at once, Larry!'

136
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:07,180
she said sharply.

137
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,670
I began to cry.

138
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:15,350
Father said nothing, but lit his pipe and
smoked it, looking out into the shadows away

139
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,720
from Mother and me.

140
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,160
It was so unfair.

141
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,980
Every time I had explained to her, the waste
of making two beds when we could both sleep

142
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,579
in one, she had told me it was healthier like
that.

143
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:36,880
And now here was this man, this stranger,
sleeping with her without the least care for

144
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,600
her health!

145
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,350
He got up early and made tea, but although
he brought Mother a cup, he brought none for

146
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,350
me.

147
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,449
'Mummy,' I shouted, 'I want a cup of tea,
too.'

148
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:55,590
'You can drink from my saucer, dear,' she
said patiently.

149
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,380
That was the end.

150
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,880
Either Father or I would have to leave the
house.

151
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,870
I didn't want to drink from Mother's saucer;
I wanted to be considered an equal in my own

152
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,870
home.

153
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,100
So I drank it all and left none for her.

154
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,600
She took that quietly too.

155
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,390
But that night when she was putting me to
bed, she said gently, 'Larry, I want you to

156
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,490
promise me that you won't come in and disturb
poor Daddy in the morning.

157
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,490
Promise?'

158
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,190
That awful 'poor Daddy' again!

159
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,490
'Why?'

160
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,120
I asked.

161
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,880
'Because poor Daddy is worried, and doesn't
sleep well.'

162
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,940
'Why doesn't he, Mummy?'

163
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,420
'Well, you know that, while he was at the
war, Mummy got our money from the post office?

164
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:50,570
Now, you see, there's no more money for us
at the post office, so Daddy must go out and

165
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,480
find us some.

166
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,490
You know what would happen if he couldn't?'

167
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,790
'No,' I said, 'tell me.'

168
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:03,890
'Well, I think we might have to go out and
beg, like the old woman outside the church.

169
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,639
We wouldn't like that, would we?'

170
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,139
'No,' I agreed.

171
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:09,380
'We wouldn't.'

172
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,180
'So you'll promise not to come in and wake
him?'

173
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,529
'Promise.'

174
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:16,360
I really meant it.

175
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,180
I knew money was a serious matter and I didn't
want to have to beg, like the old woman.

176
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,790
So when I woke the next morning, I stayed
in my room, playing with my toys for what

177
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,279
seemed like hours.

178
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,290
I was bored, and so very, very cold.

179
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:40,010
I kept thinking of the big, deep, warm bed
in Mother's room.

180
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,950
At last, I could bear it no longer.

181
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,370
I went into the next room and got into the
bed.

182
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,529
Mother woke at once with a start.

183
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,769
'Larry,' she whispered, 'what did you promise?'

184
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:56,509
'But I was quiet for ever so long!'

185
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,720
I said miserably.

186
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,149
'Oh dear, and you're so cold!'

187
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,149
she said sadly.

188
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:08,279
'Now if I let you stay, will you promise not
to talk?'

189
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,360
'But I want to talk, Mummy,' I cried.

190
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,620
'That has nothing to do with it,' she said,
with a firmness that was new to me.

191
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,190
'Daddy wants to sleep.

192
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,620
Do you understand?'

193
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,279
I understood only too well.

194
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,149
I wanted to talk, he wanted to sleep - whose
house was it, anyway?

195
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:39,080
'Mummy,' I said with equal firmness, 'I think
it would be healthier for Daddy to sleep in

196
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,940
his own bed.'

197
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,610
That seemed to surprise her, because she was
silent for a while.

198
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:55,150
Finally she said, 'Now, you must be perfectly
quiet or go back to your own bed.

199
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,300
Which is it to be?'

200
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,860
The unfairness of it made me angry.

201
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,079
I gave Father a kick, which she didn't notice,
but which made him open his eyes.

202
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:08,230
'Go to sleep again, Mick,' she told him calmly.

203
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:14,069
'Now, Larry,' she said to me, getting out
of bed, 'you must go back.'

204
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:22,290
This time, in spite of her quiet air, I knew
she meant it, and I knew I had to fight back,

205
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,800
or lose my position in the home.

206
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,290
As she picked me up, I gave a scream loud
enough to wake the dead.

207
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,970
'That damn child!' said Father.

208
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,350
'Doesn't he ever sleep?'

209
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,480
He turned to the wall, and then looked back
over his shoulder at me, with nothing showing

210
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,029
except two small, mean, dark eyes.

211
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:48,990
I broke free from Mother's hold and ran to
the furthest corner, screaming wildly.

212
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,459
Father sat up in bed.

213
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:55,300
'Shut your mouth, you young dog!' he said
violently.

214
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,649
I was so surprised that I stopped making a
noise.

215
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:06,379
Never, never had anyone spoken to me like
that before.

216
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:08,509
'Shut your mouth yourself!'

217
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,260
I shouted, mad with anger.

218
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,860
'What's that you said?' shouted Father, jumping
out of bed.

219
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
'Mick!'

220
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,860
cried Mother.

221
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,910
'Don't you see he isn't used to you?'

222
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,360
'I see he's better fed than taught!

223
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,920
I'll smack his bottom!'

224
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,610
'Smack your own!'

225
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,760
I screamed furiously.

226
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,480
'Smack your own!'

227
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,600
At this he lost his patience and started smacking
me.

228
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,959
I was so shocked at being hit by someone I
considered a complete stranger that I nearly

229
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,690
went crazy.

230
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,930
I screamed and screamed, and danced in my
bare feet.

231
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:48,579
Father, looking clumsy and hairy in nothing
but a short army shirt, stared down at me

232
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:52,370
like a mountain ready for murder.

233
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,620
It was then that I realized he was jealous,
too.

234
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,980
And there stood Mother, crying - we seemed
to be breaking her heart.

235
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,920
From that morning on, my life was a hell.

236
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,790
Father and I were openly enemies.

237
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:15,260
There were many battles between us, he trying
to steal my time with Mother, and I trying

238
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,769
to steal his.

239
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:22,560
When she was sitting on my bed telling me
a story, he pretended he needed her to find

240
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,000
a pair of his boots.

241
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,120
While he was talking to Mother, I played loudly
with my toys.

242
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,740
One evening when he came in from work, he
found me playing with his souvenirs, and became

243
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,990
terribly angry.

244
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,470
Mother took the box away from me.

245
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,650
'You mustn't play with Daddy's toys, Larry,'
she said firmly.

246
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,449
'Daddy doesn't play with yours.'

247
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:48,450
Father looked at her, quite shocked.

248
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,800
'Those are not toys,' he said crossly.

249
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,320
'Some of them are very valuable.'

250
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,420
I just couldn't understand why Mother was
interested in him.

251
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,480
In every possible way, he was less likeable
than me.

252
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:10,030
He had a workman's accent and made noises
while drinking his tea.

253
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:15,210
I thought it might be the newspapers that
she liked, so I invented some news of my own

254
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,070
to read to her.

255
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:22,090
I tried walking round with his pipe in my
mouth, until he caught me.

256
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:27,750
I even made noises while drinking tea, but
Mother said I sounded horrible.

257
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,730
It seemed to be connected with that unhealthy
habit of sleeping together, so I spent a lot

258
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,680
of time in their room, but I never saw anything
unusual going on.

259
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,780
In the end, I stopped trying.

260
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,810
Perhaps it depended on being grown up and
giving people rings.

261
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,940
I would just have to wait to find out.

262
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,420
But I didn't want him to think he had won.

263
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:01,990
One day I said, 'Mummy, do you know what I'm
going to do when I grow up?'

264
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,440
'No, dear,' she replied.

265
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
'What?'

266
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,340
'I'm going to marry you,' I said quietly.

267
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,620
Father gave a great noisy laugh, but I knew
he must be worried.

268
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,060
And Mother was pleased.

269
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:23,150
She was probably glad to know that, one day,
Father's hold over her would be broken.

270
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,990
'Won't that be nice?'

271
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,790
she said with a smile.

272
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,760
'It'll be very nice,' I said confidently.

273
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,920
'Because we're going to have lots and lots
of babies.'

274
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,270
'That's right, dear,' she said calmly.

275
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:42,180
'I think we'll have one soon, and then you'll
have someone to play with.'

276
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,660
I was really pleased about that.

277
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,010
It showed that in spite of being in Father's
power, she still considered my wishes.

278
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:57,500
And anyway, it would show the Geneys that
we could have a new baby too.

279
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,010
But the reality was very different.

280
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,340
What a disaster it was!

281
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:09,210
Sonny's arrival destroyed the peace of the
whole house, and from the first moment, I

282
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,600
disliked him.

283
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,090
He was a difficult child, and demanded far
too much attention.

284
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,420
Mother was simply silly about him, and thought
he was wonderful.

285
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,400
As 'someone to play with' he was worse than
useless.

286
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:31,300
He slept all day, and I had to be quiet all
the time to avoid waking him.

287
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:38,770
It wasn't any longer a question of not waking
Father - now it was 'Don't-wake-Sonny!'

288
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:44,100
I couldn't understand why the child wouldn't
sleep at the proper time, so whenever Mother's

289
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,820
back was turned, I woke him.

290
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:53,380
One evening, when Father came in from work,
I was playing trains in the front garden.

291
00:19:53,380 --> 00:20:00,320
I pretended I hadn't noticed him, and said
loudly, 'If another damn baby comes into this

292
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,430
house, I'm going to leave.'

293
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,320
Father stopped at once and looked at me.

294
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,460
'What's that you said?' he asked sternly.

295
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:15,390
'I was only talking to myself,' I replied
quickly, a little afraid.

296
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,620
'It's private.'

297
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,090
He turned and went inside without a word.

298
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:26,680
I intended it to be a serious warning, but
its effect was quite different.

299
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,050
Father started being nice to me.

300
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,770
I could understand that, of course.

301
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,380
Mother was quite sickening about Sonny.

302
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,620
Even at mealtimes, she'd get up and look lovingly
at him in his little bed, with a foolish smile,

303
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,060
and tell Father to look too.

304
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:49,400
He was polite about it, but he looked puzzled
- you could see he didn't know what she was

305
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,740
talking about.

306
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,920
It was painful to see how silly Mother was.

307
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,750
Father wasn't good-looking, but he had a fine
intelligence.

308
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:06,590
He knew that Sonny was nothing but trouble,
and now he realized I knew that, too.

309
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,720
One night I woke with a start.

310
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,880
There was someone beside me in my bed.

311
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:19,140
For one wild moment I felt sure it must be
Mother - she had understood what was best

312
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,740
for her and left Father forever.

313
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,600
But then I heard Sonny screaming in the next
room, and Mother saying, 'It's all right,

314
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,850
dear, it's all right, Mummy's here.'

315
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,050
So I knew it wasn't her.

316
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,780
It was Father.

317
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:42,580
He was lying beside me, completely awake,
breathing hard and angry as hell.

318
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,200
After a while, I realized what he was angry
about.

319
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,660
What had happened to me had just happened
to him.

320
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:57,020
He had pushed me out of the big bed, and now
he himself had been pushed out.

321
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:04,780
Mother had no consideration for anyone except
that unpleasant child, Sonny I couldn't help

322
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,700
feeling sorry for Father.

323
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:12,090
I had been through it all myself, and even
at that age, I was prepared to forgive and

324
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,370
forget.

325
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:18,160
I began to stroke his back and say, 'It's
all right, dear, it's all right.'

326
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,590
He didn't seem to like it much.

327
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,840
'Aren't you asleep either?' he said in an
angry whisper.

328
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,550
'Ah, come on, put your arm around me, can't
you?'

329
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:34,720
I said, and he did, in a sort of way.

330
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,880
Cautiously, I suppose, is how you'd describe
it.

331
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,140
He was very bony, but better than nothing.

332
00:22:42,140 --> 00:23:21,409
At Christmas he made a big effort and bought
me a really nice model railway.

333
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:24,140
- THE END -
