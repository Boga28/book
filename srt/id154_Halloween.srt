CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,360
A bad day at work

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,440
Angel looked at his watch. It was after nine 
o'clock. 'Where are you, Buffy?' he thought.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,800
The Bronze was busy tonight but Angel sat 
alone. He looked at the young faces around him.  

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,840
People laughed and danced. 'This 
is Buffy's world,' he thought.  

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,160
'Why am I here?' But he already knew the 
answer. He was there because he loved Buffy.

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,840
With his dark eyes, he watched the door.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,800
* * *

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,920
Buffy was almost at the Bronze. It was the 
end of October, two nights before Halloween.  

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,720
The evening was black and cold. Suddenly, 
something hit Buffy on the back of her head.  

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:09,280
She turned quickly. A vampire 
smiled at her - not a pretty smile.  

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,280
Buffy hit him hard. He got up 
quickly and laughed. He hit back.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,840
'I haven't got time for this,' Buffy 
thought. 'Angel is waiting for me.'

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,960
She pulled a stake from her jacket. Soon it 
was in the vampire's body. No more vampire.

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:45,200
'Look at me!' she thought. 'Tonight is my 
first date with Angel. My clothes are dirty.  

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,320
My hair is terrible. This isn't a good start.'

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,400
* * *

18
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,120
'She isn't coming,' thought 
Angel. He wasn't happy.

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,160
'It's like, I know,' someone said to him.  

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,360
'The Bronze just isn't cool. Why 
do we come here?' Angel looked up.

21
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,520
'Oh hi, Cordelia,' he said and looked 
back at the door. 'I'm waiting for Buffy.'

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,840
'Great!' she said, and sat down.  

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,840
She smiled and talked. She moved closer 
to Angel. Angel didn't want her there.

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,560
But he was a nice vampire, 
so he smiled back at her.

25
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,560
It was the wrong time for a smile. 
Buffy came in and saw them together.

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:54,720
'This is stupid,' she thought. 'Look at 
Cordelia. She always looks fantastic.  

27
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,960
And I look... terrible.' She turned to the door.

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,800
Angel saw Buffy across the room.

29
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,640
'Buffy?' He ran to the club door.

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,120
'Oh... hi,' Buffy said. 'I'm...'

31
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,840
'... late,' Angel finished.

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,120
'Bad day at work,' Buffy said.

33
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,960
'Hmm. I see,' said Angel. He smiled.

34
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,000
'I love your hair, Buffy!' 
Suddenly Cordelia was there.  

35
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:46,240
'Very "street fashion". How do you do it?' She 
smiled at Buffy then walked back to the table.

36
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:55,520
'Angel,' said Buffy, 'I'm going to... put 
a bag over my head. I can't stay here.'

37
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,880
'Don't listen to Cordelia. You look great.'

38
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,360
'You're very kind,' she said. 
But she didn't believe him.

39
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
'We have a date, you know,' laughed Angel.

40
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,200
'A date!' She talked quietly and sadly.  

41
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:28,160
'Other girls have dates. Not me. I 
never think about my hair and my shoes.  

42
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:37,360
I don't have time. I think about vampires 
and stakes and blood.' She left the club.

43
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,720
Angel didn't follow her. 
Cordelia came back and smiled.

44
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
'Coffee?' she asked.

45
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,920
* * *

46
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,560
The next morning, Principal 
Snyder waited for the students at  

47
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,480
Sunny dale High. He had paper and pens.

48
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,320
A girl walked into school. He grabbed her arm.

49
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
'Hey!' she said.

50
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,480
'Put your name here,' he told her.

51
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,520
'What is it?' she asked.

52
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,760
Tomorrow is Halloween, and the children 
of Sunnydale are going trick-retreating.  

53
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,720
They need some teenagers with them. 
That's you. Put your name here.'

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,120
'Can I say "no"?'

55
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,320
'No.'

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,840
The girl wrote her name angrily and went off.

57
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,360
'Did you see that?' Bander asked Buffy and Willow.

58
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,760
'Yeah. Let's walk faster,' said Buffy.

59
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:56,160
'Ah! Miss Summers.' There was a 
hand on her arm. 'Sunny dale's worst  

60
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,480
student.' He smiled. 'Put your name here.'

61
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,880
'Oh, I love children, Principal Snyder, but...  

62
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:17,200
I'm sorry... there's something wrong with 
my... ermm... hands. My doctor says...'

63
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,360
Principal Snyder gave her a pen. Then he 
gave two more pens to Willow and Xander.

64
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,440
'Write! The trick-or-treaters 
leave here at four o'clock.  

65
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,640
They must be home at six. 
Don't forget your costumes.'

66
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:48,160
'I don't believe it!' said Xander. 'It's 
Halloween - party night. And we're going  

67
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,440
to have lots of small children with us. 
And we're going to be in stupid costumes!'

68
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:04,320
'I wanted a night at home!' said Buffy. 'It's 
the only quiet night in the year for me.'

69
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:14,400
'Halloween is quiet?!' Xander was surprised. 
'Isn't it party night for vampires?'

70
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,520
'No, they stay at home. Giles told me.'

71
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,000
'I love those vampires,' said Xander.

72
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:43,840
'So usually I can stay in, too. 
But now I can't. Thanks, Snyder.'

73
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,040
CHAPTER TWO

74
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,360
A long, red dress

75
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,200
At morning break, Buffy and Willow got drinks.

76
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,080
'How was your date last night?' asked Willow.

77
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:14,400
'Bad,' said Buffy. 'I met a vampire on the way to 
the Bronze, so I was late. And I looked terrible.'

78
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,960
'Was Angel angry?'

79
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:26,000
'No, but only because of 
Cordelia. She does dates, not me.'

80
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,920
'Cordelia? Angel doesn't like Cordelia.'

81
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:41,440
'Willow, what does he like? Who is he? I met him 
a year ago, but I know almost nothing about him.'

82
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,080
'Yeah, well, I don't have any answers,'  

83
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:56,720
said Willow. Then Buffy had an idea. She 
grabbed Willow. 'The Watcher Diaries!'

84
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,000
'Yeah...' said Willow slowly. 
'And they're Giles's books...  

85
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,720
in Giles's desk... and Giles is a teacher.'

86
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,400
'You're right,' said Buffy with a smile.  

87
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,600
'We mustn't take things from 
Giles's desk. It's wrong.'

88
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
* * *

89
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,520
Buffy and Willow looked through 
the doors of the library.  

90
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,080
Giles wasn't there. Willow stayed 
at the door and Buffy went in.

91
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:39,200
Buffy walked very quietly to Giles's 
desk. 'Buffy!' said Giles. 'Good.'

92
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,720
'Oh!' She turned in surprise. 'Nothing! Hi.'

93
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,600
'What?' Giles looked at her. Was 
she a bit strange today? 'Now,  

94
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:02,480
about tomorrow night. Halloween is always 
quiet. Maybe we can try some new kicks...'

95
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,360
'Giles,' Buffy stopped him. 'Don't 
you just have fun sometimes?'

96
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,840
'I have lots of fun hobbies,' 
said Giles, and opened a book.  

97
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,680
Buffy looked at the door, at Willow.  

98
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,960
Her eyes said, 'Come in. Get the Watcher Diaries. 
Giles isn't looking.' Willow's mouth said,  

99
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,600
'No!' Buffy's eyes said, 'Now!' Willow 
walked across the room behind Giles.

100
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,320
'What hobbies?' asked Buffy. 
'Well,' Giles started,  

101
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,880
'I, -er... sometimes I clean 
my books. I enjoy that.'

102
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:00,240
'One day, leave your books for an hour 
or two, Giles. There's a world out there.  

103
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,080
There's this cool place. You 
go in and sit down in the dark.  

104
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,560
There are pictures on the wall. 
They move. They tell a story...'

105
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,960
'Very funny, ha ha,' said Giles.

106
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,520
Willow and the Watcher 
Diaries were back at the door.

107
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,720
'OK, Giles, I gotta go. 
Bye.' She ran from the room.

108
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,960
* * *

109
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,920
Buffy and Willow sat in the girls' 
room. They read the Watcher Diaries.

110
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,080
'Wow!' said Buffy. 'Look at her.'

111
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:49,280
There was a picture of a beautiful woman in 
a long dress. 'Who is she?' asked Willow.

112
00:11:50,240 --> 00:12:00,000
'It doesn't say. But look! It says 
1775 here. Angel was 18 then.'

113
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,160
'She looks very rich,' said Willow.

114
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,560
Buffy thought about Angel in 1775. He 
was young then, and a man, not a vampire.  

115
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,280
'She knew him in the best part of 
his life. Lucky woman!' she said.

116
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,200
'No!' said Willow. 'Life was 
terrible for women then.'

117
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,320
The girls' room door opened.

118
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:40,880
'Well, Buffy, you left poor Angel alone 
last night. ' It was Cordelia. 'He's so  

119
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,760
nice. But what's his story? 
I never see him around.'

120
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,680
'Not during the day,' said Willow.

121
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,320
Cordelia looked at Willow.

122
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,760
'He's a vampire. Didn't you know?'

123
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:06,000
'A nice vampire?! I don't believe you. You can't 
keep me away from Angel with stupid stories like  

124
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,280
that. Maybe you're the Vampire Slayer, 
Buffy, but I'm the Man Slayer around here.'

125
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,400
* * *

126
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,760
'It's so busy in here. You can't 
move!' shouted Buffy to Willow.  

127
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,360
They were in Ethan's Costume Shop. Most 
of Sunnydale's children were there too.

128
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:39,680
'But it's better than Party Town!' Willow shouted 
back. Ethan's was new. 'I've got a ghost costume.'

129
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,040
'And I'm getting some soldier 
clothes and a gun,' said Xander.

130
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,800
'Halloween isn't my...' Buffy 
stopped. 'Hey! Look at that.'

131
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,840
Willow and Xander followed Buffy to the back 
of the shop. There they saw a long, red dress.

132
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,920
'It's the dress in the Watcher Diaries,' said 
Buffy. 'From eighteen-seventy-something.'

133
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,480
'1775,' said Willow. She remembered these things.

134
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,560
'I want it,' said Buffy, quietly.

135
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:30,320
Suddenly there was a man next to them. 
It was Ethan Rayne and this was his shop.

136
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:38,240
'Please,' he said to Buffy. He took the dress 
and put it against her. 'Ah! Beautiful.'  

137
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,520
The dress changed Buffy from a pretty 
girl into a very beautiful woman.

138
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,880
'Wow!' thought Buffy.

139
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,360
'Wow!' said Willow arid Xander together.

140
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Buffy woke up. 'I'm sorry,' 
she said. 'It's too expensive.'

141
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:10,560
'No, no,' said Ethan. 'Forget the money. 
You must have it. It's so right for you.'

142
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,040
'Great! Thanks,' said Buffy.

143
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,920
Ethan Rayne smiled.

144
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,680
* * *

145
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,600
The old building was empty.  

146
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:30,640
No one lived or worked there now. It wasn't a 
nice part of town, so the vampires liked it.

147
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Spike walked up and down. 'Buffy,'  

148
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:46,160
he thought. 'Buffy must die. Drusilla needs more 
blood, but that Slayer makes it so difficult.'

149
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,640
'Spike,' someone said quietly.

150
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:58,480
He turned. His angry face was 
suddenly kind. It was Drusilla.

151
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,560
'Do you love me?' she asked.

152
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:11,120
'Come here, my beautiful one,' he said. 
He put his arms around her weak body.

153
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,120
'Buffy's going to die soon, my love,'  

154
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:23,440
he said. 'Then you can drink all the blood 
in Sunnydale. And you can be strong again.'

155
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,240
'Something is going to happen. I can 
see it. Buffy is going to be weak.'

156
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,520
'What do you mean? Are there 
pictures in your head?'

157
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,720
Drusilla closed her eyes.

158
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:50,720
'Come on, my love. Talk to Spike,' he said. 
'What's going to happen to the Slayer? When?'

159
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,880
'Tomorrow,' answered Drusilla.

160
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,120
'But tomorrow is Halloween. 
Nothing happens on Halloween.'

161
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:17,840
'This Halloween is different. 
Someone new is in town.'

162
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,000
CHAPTER THREE

163
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,320
The fun starts

164
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:39,120
Ethan's Costume Shop closed for the night. But 
Ethan stayed in the shop. He was in the back room,  

165
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:48,640
in long, black clothes. In front of him there 
was a statue with the face of a beautiful woman.  

166
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:57,920
He put his hands together. Soon there 
was blood on them - lots of blood.

167
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:10,640
He said something to the statue in an old, dead 
language. 'Janus,' he cried, 'I am your son.'

168
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,560
He walked around to the back of the 
statue. Here it had another face.  

169
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,920
But this one wasn't beautiful - it was evil.

170
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,320
* * *

171
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,960
School finished early on Halloween. Soon 
Buffy was in her costume in her bedroom.

172
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,000
'I'm the woman in the Watcher 
Diaries,' she thought.

173
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,880
'Where are you meeting Angel?' shouted 
Willow. She was in the bathroom.

174
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,600
'Here. When the trick-or-treaters 
go home. Mum's out this evening.'

175
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,240
'Does he know about your costume?'

176
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,120
'No, he doesn't. It's going to be a 
big surprise! Now. come out, Willow.'

177
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,040
'OK. But don't laugh.'

178
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:17,760
Buffy didn't laugh. Willow looked fantastic 
in one of Buffy's tops and a very short skirt.

179
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:27,040
'Wow!' said Buffy. 'Forget Cordelia. 
Meet Willow, the new Man Slayer.'

180
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,320
'But this isn't me.' Willow wasn't very happy.

181
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:40,240
'It's Halloween, Willow. You can be a 
different person at Halloween - a new you.  

182
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,040
It's just for one night.'

183
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,320
Someone was at the door.

184
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,480
'Xander's here. Are you ready?'

185
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,800
'Yeah. OK,' said Willow.

186
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,320
Buffy ran down and opened the door. 
Xander pointed his gun at her.

187
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,840
'Buffy! You are so beautiful!'

188
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,280
'But look at Willow!' said Buffy, 
and they turned. 'She's... oh...'

189
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Willow was in her costume from Ethan's... a ghost.

190
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,520
* * *

191
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,040
'Let's get our little monsters,' said Xander.  

192
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,560
They were at Sunnydale High. There were 
young children in costumes everywhere.

193
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,320
Principal Snyder saw them. He came over to Buffy.  

194
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:48,080
Five little people with green 
faces and black teeth followed him.

195
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,880
'Here's your group, Summers,' 
he said. He didn't smile.

196
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,040
'Just bring them all back here at six o'clock.'

197
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,120
* * *

198
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,520
Children ran from house to house 
on the streets of Sunnydale.  

199
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,760
They shouted and laughed. People answered 
their doors and looked frightened.

200
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,760
Soon it was nearly six and Buffy's group were 
tired. Some of them didn't like the dark.

201
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,960
'ОК,' she said to them, 'one more house, 
and then we're going back to school.'

202
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,640
The children ran to another house.

203
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,440
'I'm enjoying this,' she thought. 'It's fun.'

204
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,920
* * *

205
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,280
Back at the costume shop, Ethan 
was ready for his Halloween fun.

206
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:53,360
'Janus,' he said to the statue, 'this night 
is yours.' Buffy was suddenly very cold.  

207
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,600
In the next road, Mrs Parker came to 
her front door. Willow's group waited.

208
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,280
'Trick-or-treat!' they shouted.

209
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:13,360
'Oh!' Mrs Parker put her hands up. 
'I'm so frightened!' Then she smiled.  

210
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,560
'What lovely children!'  

211
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,840
Ethan took the statue in his hands. Buffy 
started to feel a cold wind around her.  

212
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:36,320
A strange green light came from the statue. 
Ethan smiled. 'Now the fun can start.'

213
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,720
Mrs Parker looked at the trick-or-treaters.

214
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:49,680
'Well, Mr Monster,' she said to the 
nearest child. 'What can I... AAAARRRGH!'

215
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,160
A green hand grabbed her neck.  

216
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,400
The child-monster wasn't a child now. 
It was a monster - strong and evil.

217
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,840
'What are you doing!? Stop that,' cried Willow.

218
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,360
Mrs Parker pulled the monster's hand off her neck.  

219
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,840
She ran into the house and 
closed the door quickly.

220
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:27,760
Willow suddenly didn't feel right. Her 
eyes closed. 'I'm falling,' she thought.  

221
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,960
Then her body was on the floor. She was dead.

222
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,520
* * *

223
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:43,040
Xander wasn't far away. He started 
to feel strange, too. Then he was OK.  

224
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,480
But he was different. He wasn't 
Xander in a soldier costume - he  

225
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:58,800
was a soldier. He was tall and strong. 
His eyes were cold, and he had a gun.

226
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,960
* * *

227
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,840
Willow sat up. 'What happened?'  

228
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:15,200
She walked a little. Then she turned. 'Oh, oh!' 
Her body - in its ghost costume - was still there.  

229
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:24,080
She looked at her clothes - short skirt, 
short top - Willow the Man Slayer...  

230
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,840
'Oh no! I'm a ghost. I'm Willow's ghost.'

231
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,920
She looked down the street. There were frightened 
children and little monsters everywhere.  

232
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,720
Then she heard a gun.

233
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,640
'Xander!' She ran to him.

234
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:55,040
He turned, with his gun on her. He looked 
like Xander, but something was different.

235
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,240
'It's me. Willow.'

236
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,600
'I don't know a Willow.' He grabbed her 
arm, but his hand went through her body.  

237
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
'Hey! What are you?'

238
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:19,680
'Xander, listen to me. We're friends. Something 
terrible is happening. I was in a ghost costume,  

239
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:28,880
and now I am a ghost. You were in a soldier 
costume, and now you are a soldier.'

240
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,200
'I don't believe you.'

241
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,160
A little vampire ran from a house. 
Xander pointed his gun at it.

242
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,840
'No!' cried Willow. 'There's a 
little child in there. No guns, OK?'

243
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,280
And then she saw Buffy.

244
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,320
'Buffy, are you all right?'

245
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:01,520
The little vampire came back. It had a big 
monster with it this time. They moved nearer.

246
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:11,680
'Buffy, what do we do?' asked Willow. Buffy 
looked at the monsters with frightened eyes.  

247
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:23,840
And then she started to fall.

248
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,960
CHAPTER FOUR

249
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,040
Who's Buffy?

250
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,480
Willow looked at Buffy's body on the 
floor. She didn't believe her eyes.

251
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,320
'Buffy? Are you OK?'

252
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,840
'What? Who is Buffy?' said Buffy.

253
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,120
'She's not Buffy,' Willow said to Xander.

254
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,280
'Who's Buffy?' asked Xander.

255
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:11,520
'Oh, this is fun,' said Willow. And 
then to Buffy, 'What year is this?'

256
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:22,480
Buffy thought. '1775, I believe. 
I don't understand. Who are you?'

257
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,000
'We're friends. Here, take my hand.'

258
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:38,720
'Your clothes... everything... is strange,' 
said Buffy. 'How did I come here?'

259
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,840
Willow looked at Xander. 'What's going to 
happen to us without the Slayer?' she said.

260
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,080
'What's a Slayer?' asked Xander.

261
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:02,640
Suddenly a monster kicked Buffy from behind. 
This new Buffy didn't kick back. She just  

262
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,480
screamed. Xander hit the monster 
with his gun and it ran off.

263
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,720
'Let's go into a house,' said Xander.

264
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,600
'Monster!' cried Buffy. 'A monster!'

265
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:27,600
Willow and Xander turned. They were ready. But 
there wasn't a monster. There was only a car.

266
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,880
'It's a car,' said Willow.

267
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,400
'What does it want?' said Buffy.

268
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,800
'What's wrong with this woman?' asked Xander.

269
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,400
'She's from 1775. They didn't 
have cars then,' said Willow.  

270
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,400
'Let's go. Buffy's house is near here.'

271
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,840
Buffy and Xander followed Willow. They went 
into Buffy's kitchen through the back door.  

272
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,280
Xander closed the door and watched 
at the window. 'We're OK... for now.'

273
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,320
BANG, BANG, BANG!

274
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,960
'The front door! Quick!' Xander 
and Willow ran through the house.

275
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,160
'Don't open it!' said Willow. 
'There are vampires out there.'

276
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,520
The sound stopped. Willow and 
Xander stopped too, and waited.

277
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,520
Buffy came into the room and 
looked at a photo of a young woman.

278
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,120
'This is just like me,' she said.

279
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,240
'It is you,' said Willow. 'Buffy, 
can't you remember anything?'

280
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:54,240
'No... no. I don't understand. 
I don't wear these... these...  

281
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:04,000
Are they clothes? I don't like this place. 
I don't like you. Where is my home?'

282
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,640
Just then a green hand came through the window.  

283
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,280
It grabbed Xander's arm but he hit 
it with his gun. The thing ran away.

284
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,840
Now there was a different scream. 
It wasn't Buffy this time.  

285
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,440
Xander opened the front door and ran out.

286
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:34,080
'Hey! Stop!' called Willow. Xander came 
back. He pulled a woman in a cat costume  

287
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:41,360
into the house. She was dirty and there 
was blood on her arms. It was Cordelia.

288
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,120
'What's happening?' she cried.

289
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:53,600
'Cordelia!' said Willow. 'OK, now 
listen. Your name is Cordelia.  

290
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,440
You're not a cat. You're at high school, 
and we're your friends..., well...'

291
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,080
'That's nice, Willow,' Cordelia 
said. 'But I'm not stupid.'

292
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,080
'Do you know us? Oh, that's 
fantastic,' said Willow.

293
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,560
'Er... yeah,' said Cordelia. 
'You're a bit strange today.  

294
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:27,200
But look at my costume. Party 
Town isn't going to like this.'

295
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:38,240
'OK,' said Willow. 'Cordelia, you stay here 
with Xander and Buffy. I'm going to see Giles.'

296
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
***

297
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:48,000
Willow didn't see Spike in the street. He 
was under a tree in his long, black coat.  

298
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,480
His vampire face was evil. He 
looked around him and smiled.

299
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,960
'Well,' he said, 'this is... great!'

300
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,960
Xander and Buffy watched the streets from 
the front door. They were OK... for now.  

301
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,760
Cordelia watched from a bedroom window.

302
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,880
'Oh, good,' said someone behind 
them. 'You're all right.'

303
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,960
They turned. It was Angel. 'It's evil out there.'

304
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,800
'Who are you?' they asked.

305
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,880
* * *

306
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,560
'ОК,' said Angel, 'what's happening here?'  

307
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:49,200
He looked at Buffy's dress. He remembered 
something... someone... from long ago...

308
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,840
'Do you live here?' asked Xander.

309
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:02,400
'No! You know that. Buffy...?' This was Buffy...  

310
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:12,320
but not Buffy. 'What's up with your hair, 
Buffy? You look... different,' he said.

311
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:21,520
'They don't know you, Angel.' It was Cordelia. 
'And everyone in the street's a monster.'  

312
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Then she remembered her smile. 
'So, Angel, how are you?'

313
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,480
Someone turned off the lights. 
Buffy screamed and grabbed Cordelia.

314
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,320
'Hey!' said Cordelia. 'Keep your hands off me!'

315
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,360
Xander turned to Angel.

316
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,840
'Take the girl to the kitchen. Watch 
the door. Catwoman, stay here with me.'

317
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:59,840
In the kitchen, the back door was 
open. 'I closed that,' said Angel.  

318
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:09,120
He moved quietly to the door. Buffy stayed 
by the wall. She didn't see the vampire.

319
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
'Be careful!' cried Angel.

320
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,200
He grabbed the vampire and 
kicked it into the dining room.

321
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:26,160
'Get a stake!' Angel shouted to Buffy. He turned 
to her. She saw Angel's face and screamed.  

322
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,840
It was his vampire face - angry and 
terrible. She ran out of the house.

323
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,480
'Buffy, no!' shouted Angel. The 
other vampire hit Angel hard.

324
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,760
* * *

325
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,840
There were a lot of books in 
front of Giles and Willow.

326
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,120
'This isn't helping,' Willow 
said. 'What are we looking for?'

327
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:01,840
'OK,' said Giles. 'Let's think. 
At six o'clock, everyone changed.'

328
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:11,760
'Right. So now Xander's a soldier, 
and Buffy's a girl from 1775.'

329
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,240
Giles looked at Willow. 'And you are...?'

330
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,920
'I'm a ghost,' said Willow.

331
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,600
Giles smiled and looked at her short 
skirt and top. 'A ghost of...?'

332
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,120
Willow went red. 'You didn't see 
Cordelia! She has cat ears and...'

333
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,360
'So Cordelia is now a cat?!'

334
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,120
Willow looked at Giles. 'Wait a minute,'  

335
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:57,840
she said slowly. 'Cordelia isn't a cat. She's 
the same old Cordelia... in a cat costume.'

336
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,640
'She didn't change, then.'

337
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,720
'No.' Willow thought for a minute.  

338
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:14,640
'I know! Party Town! That's it. 
Her costume came from Party Town.'

339
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,640
'And you, Buffy, Xander. Where... ?'

340
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,840
'We went to this new place,' 
Willow said. 'Ethan's.'

341
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:39,840
'Come on!' said Giles. 'Quick!'

342
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,440
CHAPTER FIVE

343
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,840
'I'm home'

344
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,080
'Hello?' Giles called. 'Is anyone in?'

345
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:10,720
The shop was dark. Willow saw an open door 
at the back. There was a statue in the room.  

346
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,640
It had an evil face with green eyes.

347
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,400
'What does it mean?' she asked.

348
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,840
'It's Janus,' said Giles.  

349
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:31,200
'From an old world. Janus has two faces 
- man and woman, good and evil...'

350
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,800
'Milk and dark...' Ethan was just behind them.  

351
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:44,000
Willow and Giles turned quickly. 
'Oh no, sorry. That's chocolate.'

352
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,960
Ethan smiled at Giles.

353
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:55,280
'Willow,' Giles said. He didn't 
look at her. 'Go to Buffy. Now.'

354
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:56,640
'But...'

355
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,080
'Now, Willow.'

356
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,800
She turned and ran.

357
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,840
'Hello, Ethan.'

358
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:12,080
'Hello, Rupert, my old friend,' 
Ethan answered. 'This is nice.'

359
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:22,400
Giles didn't smile. 'I was stupid. 
I didn't think of you. But of course  

360
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:29,280
this Halloween thing is your idea. 
It's just like all your other plans.'

361
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,280
'Yes,' Ethan said. 'All my plans are clever.'

362
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,600
'Not clever, Ethan - evil.'

363
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:50,000
'Well, Rupert, you know all about evil, 
of course.' He laughed. 'But maybe  

364
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,000
they don't know about you here.' Giles 
changed. No one in Sunnydale knew this Giles.

365
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:05,200
'Stop your evil, Ethan. Then leave 
this place. Never come here again.'

366
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,360
'Oooooh. I'm frightened...'

367
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,880
Giles hit him. Ethan went 
down hard onto the floor.

368
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,440
There was blood on his mouth.

369
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,760
* * *

370
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,080
Angel's vampire face changed, 
and he looked like a man again.  

371
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,360
He found Xander and Cordelia 
and they ran into the road.

372
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,480
'Buffy, Buffy, where are you?' Angel called.

373
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,320
'Let's go this way,' said Xander.

374
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,600
'She needs help - now,' Angel said. 'I know it.'

375
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,600
'Buffy's always OK,' said Cordelia.

376
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,080
'But this isn't Buffy...'

377
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,880
* * *

378
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,440
Spike watched them. He had 
two small vampires with him.

379
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:08,320
'Did you hear that, my friends? Drusilla 
was right. Tonight Buffy is weak.  

380
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:16,880
Come on. We must find her first. 
Then we can drink that lovely blood.'

381
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,280
* * *

382
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,840
Buffy was alone on a dark street in the 
bad part of town. She was very frightened.

383
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:34,480
She ran into something... someone. 
He was big and dirty, with bad teeth.

384
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:43,760
'Pretty... pretty,' he said, and 
grabbed Buffy. 'Mmm,' he said. 'Nice.'

385
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,400
'No!' cried Buffy.

386
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:53,760
Xander suddenly arrived. 'Hey!' he 
shouted, and pulled the man off Buffy.  

387
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,640
Buffy screamed and ran... right into Cordelia.

388
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,680
Then Buffy saw Angel. She screamed 
again and grabbed Cordelia.

389
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:12,480
'What's up with you?' Cordelia cried. 
'That man! Your friend! He's...  

390
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,400
he's a vampire!' she screamed.

391
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,880
Cordelia smiled at Angel. 'She thinks...  

392
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:32,160
oh, forget it.' Then she turned to Buffy. 
'It's OK. Angel is... a friend. He likes us.'

393
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:43,440
'Hey!' They all turned. It was Willow. 'We gotta 
get out of the road,' she said. 'This way.' Angel  

394
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,280
ran to an old building. The others followed 
him into the building and closed the door.  

395
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,560
But Spike was just behind them, with 
a lot of little vampires. They kicked  

396
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:04,240
the door and it opened. Spike came into the 
building. He smiled at his little helpers.

397
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,640
* * *

398
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,120
Ethan had lots of blood on his face,  

399
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:19,040
but he smiled too. 'How do I stop this evil?' 
Giles asked. He cleaned the blood from his hands.

400
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,320
Ethan laughed. 'Say "please"' Giles kicked him.

401
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:35,120
'OK. OK! B-B-Break Janus, ' said 
Ethan. 'B-Break the statue.'

402
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
***

403
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,920
Vampires pulled Angel and Xander away.  

404
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:50,480
Spike turned to Buffy. 'My little one,' he said. 
'Frightened. Alone. No one can help you now.'

405
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,320
He smiled kindly. Then he hit her across the face.

406
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,600
'I'm enjoying this, ' he laughed.

407
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,120
'Buffy!' Angel cried. But the 
vampires pulled him harder.

408
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,800
Spike grabbed Buffy's head with one hand.  

409
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,600
He had her arm in the other. His long white 
teeth came close to her beautiful neck.

410
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,920
'Hi!' she said to Spike. 'I'm home.'

411
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,880
Spike didn't look happy now. Buffy 
was the Vampire Slayer again,  

412
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:04,160
and she was very angry. She kicked him 
and hit him. Then she kicked him again.

413
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,440
'Do you know something?' she 
said. 'I'm enjoying this!'

414
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,400
Spike hit the floor hard and didn't move again.

415
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,720
'Hey, Buff!' said Xander. 'We're back!'

416
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,600
'Do you remember anything?' asked Cordelia.

417
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,040
'Yeah, ' said Xander. 'It was like,  

418
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,360
"I'm here. I can hear you. But I 
can't get out. " It was strange.'

419
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:43,920
'Are you OK?' Angel asked Buffy quietly. Buffy 
looked into his dark eyes. She loved those eyes.

420
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,080
'Yeah,' she smiled. He took 
her arm and they went out.

421
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,480
'Hey!' said Xander. 'Where's Willow?'

422
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,320
* * *

423
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:03,840
'What happened?' asked Willow. She was at 
Mrs Parker's house in her ghost costume.

424
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:10,880
'Well, I'm in my own body again, ' 
she thought. 'That feels better.'

425
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,440
* * *

426
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,520
Buffy was in Buffy clothes with Buffy 
hair again. She was at home, with Angel.  

427
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,240
She sat down next to him.

428
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,560
'I like this Buffy, ' he said. 'I 
hated the girls in the old days.'

429
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,560
'Did you?'

430
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:41,200
'They were boring. I want someone... 
exciting.' He moved closer. 'Interesting.'

431
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:42,960
'Oh yeah?'

432
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,160
'Strong.'

433
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:53,440
Then he took her in his arms. And Buffy 
smiled. 'This feels right, ' she thought.

434
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,000
* * *

435
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:05,680
The next day, Giles was in Ethan's empty shop. He 
walked around slowly. Suddenly he saw some paper.  

436
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:27,840
There were words on it. 'See you soon,' he read. 
Giles looked up. His eyes were hard and cold.
 
 

437
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,640
-  

438
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,014
THE END -
