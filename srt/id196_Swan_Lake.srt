CHAPTER ONE
Prince Zigfried

2
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:29,689
Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there
lived a Prince.

3
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:34,360
His name was Zigfried, and he was very unhappy.

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,300
His father, the King, had died, and since
then, everyone in the palace had forgotten

5
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,080
how to smile.

6
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,540
Without his father, Zigfried thought he would
never feel happy again.

7
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,780
Every day, Zigfried sat at the window in his
room in the palace, looking at the birds in

8
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,989
the trees.

9
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,400
"How can they sing and fly so free?

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,650
They must not feel like me."

11
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,610
His servant, Ozlowe, tried to make the prince
smile by telling him jokes or doing funny

12
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,810
tricks for him.

13
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,659
But the Prince would not smile.

14
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,530
"I know you love me Ozlowe, but I cannot smile.

15
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,640
My heart is broken."

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,020
Ozlowe would not give up.

17
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,530
"Let's go for a walk, good Prince.

18
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,560
Maybe we can find something outside which
will make you happy."

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,550
"If you wish Ozlowe, but I don't think there's
anything that can make me happy."

20
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,100
Ozlowe put on his hunting cap, and he took
his crossbow.

21
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,750
He enjoyed hunting and he hoped to catch a
bird or a rabbit for the Prince.

22
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,640
They walked through the forest until they
came to a lake.

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,210
On the lake there was a beautiful white swan.

24
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,750
It had a gold crown on its head, that only
Princesses wear.

25
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,860
The swan swam towards the prince and looked
into his eyes.

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,050
The swan's eyes were so sad that Prince Zigfried
felt sorry for it.

27
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,091
"Here is a creature which feels worse than
I do.

28
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,322
But why do you have that crown on your head?"

29
00:02:07,322 --> 00:02:11,970
The swan opened its wings and cried out.

30
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,590
"I think it's trying to tell me something."

31
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,520
Ozlowe had his crossbow in his hands.

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,450
He wanted to shoot the swan.

33
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,260
"I'll get that swan for you.

34
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,260
Prince.

35
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,510
Just one minute."

36
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,829
"Ozlowe, no!"

37
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:32,969
Before Ozlowe could shoot, a magic owl flew
from a tree and took Ozlowe's cap off his

38
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:34,930
head.

39
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,680
This cast a spell on him, and he was turned
to stone.

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,400
The Prince did not understand.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,800
"Ozlowe, what has happened to you?

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,849
Speak to me!"

43
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:50,129
He looked back at the lake.

44
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,880
The swan was gone.

45
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,769
"Everything I do goes wrong.

46
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:57,620
This must have happened because of me!"

47
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,900
The Prince returned to the palace sadder than
before, thinking to himself:

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,520
"If only Ozlowe were here!

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,939
There is nothing good in my life any more".

50
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:14,639
Zigfried's mother came to see him that night.

51
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,930
She had something important to say.

52
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,989
"Zigfried, soon you will be eighteen years
old.

53
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,919
You must take your father's place as King.

54
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:35,180
I am having a ball on your birthday so that
you may choose a wife, and I will invite all

55
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,629
the princesses from the other kingdoms."

56
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:40,400
"But I do not wish to marry, Mother.

57
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,329
I do not love anyone."

58
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,989
"You will learn to love someone.

59
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,420
First, you must stop thinking of yourself."

60
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,459
"If this will make you happy, I'll do it,
Mother."

61
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,180
"It is not for my happiness that I am doing
this.

62
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,200
It is for yours, and all the other people
in this land.

63
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,370
You see, love is more powerful than we know.

64
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,939
Without it, you will not be a great King."

65
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,840
His mother left him.

66
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,780
He sat at the window, thinking of what she
had said.

67
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:35,290
He wanted to love someone with all his heart,
but he didn't know who it would be.

68
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:43,600
CHAPTER TWO
The Beautiful Princess

69
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,340
On the morning of the Royal Ball, everybody
was very busy in the palace.

70
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,440
The Queen's maids were preparing the Queen's
dress.

71
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,530
The servants cleaned the floors and windows,
and the cooks were cooking enough food for

72
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,640
a thousand people.

73
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,770
The prince looked handsome in his red outfit.

74
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,500
But he was still not happy.

75
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:16,270
He left the palace to be alone and think,
and went to the stone statue of Ozlowe.

76
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,050
"It's my birthday today Ozlowe.

77
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,570
I'm eighteen.

78
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,380
That means that I must marry someone and become
King.

79
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,920
The problem is I don't want to get married;
I don't love anyone."

80
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,460
There was a quiet splashing in the lake.

81
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,920
Zigfried looked and saw the beautiful swan
with the gold crown.

82
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,860
"There it is!

83
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,810
The beautiful swan has come back."

84
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,450
He went closer to the water to look at it.

85
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,920
Its eyes had the same sadness in them, but
it was happy to see Zigfried and it swam close

86
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,710
to him.

87
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,710
Zigfried looked into its eyes and talked to
it.

88
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,120
"I think you understand me.

89
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,950
I think you know how people feel."

90
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,470
A tear fell from the swan's eye.

91
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,140
"Don't cry.

92
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,500
You should be happy that you are a swan.

93
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,490
You will never have to marry someone you do
not love.

94
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,470
You will never feel sad when someone dies."

95
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,340
The swan made a loud cry.

96
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,080
Its wings moved back and forth at its sides.

97
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:29,330
Suddenly, an owl appeared as if from nowhere
and flew at Zigfried's head, but it missed.

98
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,190
The owl flew off, and the swan began to swim
away.

99
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,190
"Wait.

100
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,120
Don't leave."

101
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,690
Zigfried ran round the edge of the lake, following
the swan.

102
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,510
He had to run fast to see where it went.

103
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:48,200
Soon, he was in a part of the forest he did
not know.

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,000
Tall trees blocked out the sun.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,380
It was very dark.

106
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,830
The swan swam to an ugly old castle.

107
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:06,451
When it left the water, something magical
happened; the swan turned into a beautiful

108
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:07,910
Princess.

109
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:14,780
She had long blonde hair and she wore a long
white dress.

110
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,890
The crown was still on her head.

111
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,710
Zigfried ran to where she stood at the castle
door.

112
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,300
"Wait!

113
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,010
Where are you going?"

114
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,710
The Princess stopped, but she did not look
at him.

115
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,120
"Look at me, please.

116
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,910
My name is Prince Zigfried and I want to know
who you are."

117
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,870
The Princess turned to look at the Prince.

118
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,490
She had the same dark, sad eyes of the swan.

119
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,050
"My name is Princess Odile."

120
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,170
"But why were you a swan?

121
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,600
Why do you look so sad?"

122
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,580
"An evil wizard called Rocford cast a spell
on me.

123
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,420
I may only leave the castle during the day
as a swan."

124
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,390
"Where is this wizard?

125
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,950
I will talk to him.

126
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,450
I will tell him this is wrong."

127
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,450
"No, you mustn't.

128
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,190
He will hurt you, I know.

129
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,060
He does not want me to see another man."

130
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,160
"Tell me where this man is!

131
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,520
I will fight him and free you."

132
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,600
"No, you must leave.

133
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
He is dangerous."

134
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,270
"I won't leave until I see him; You must be
set free."

135
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,270
"Please.

136
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,980
You are very kind, but you must go away."

137
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,710
"I won't!"

138
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,370
She looked into his eyes again.

139
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,700
"If you want to do something for me, you will
leave now."

140
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,870
"Odile, I will leave if you want me to.

141
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,729
But I want you to come to the ball tonight.

142
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:36,360
I must choose a wife and I want to choose
you."

143
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,380
"I can't.

144
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,930
The wizard won't let me."

145
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,460
"Find a way.

146
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,430
Promise me you'll try."

147
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,940
She spoke softly.

148
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,930
"All right.

149
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:57,760
I'll try."

150
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,900
CHAPTER THREE
Odet

151
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,230
Zigfried left, and Odile went inside the castle.

152
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,220
Odet, the wizard's evil daughter, was behind
a tree.

153
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,480
When she saw Odile talking to the Prince,
she was jealous; she wanted to go to the ball,

154
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,560
and what was more, she wanted to marry the
Prince.

155
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,850
She didn't like Odile, because she was so
beautiful and kind.

156
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:41,520
But the wizard loved her, so Odet couldn't
do anything to hurt her... until now!

157
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:48,770
Odet went to the wizard's room, but he was
not there.

158
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,370
The room looked like a museum.

159
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:58,510
There was an Egyptian statue against one wall,
and large aquariums full of strange fish.

160
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:05,830
On a table stood many different coloured bottles.

161
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,540
Odet opened one of the bottles.

162
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,810
Smoke came out of it.

163
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,490
It smelled of burning wood.

164
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:23,660
The magic owl flew into the open window, unseen
by Odet, and changed back into the wizard.

165
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,750
"Do you like the smell?"

166
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,490
"Oh, Father!

167
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,490
You scared me."

168
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,990
"You wouldn't be afraid if you were not in
my room when I wasn't here."

169
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,020
"I know father, but I have something very
important to tell you.

170
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,750
It's about Odile."

171
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,300
The wizard opened his eyes wide.

172
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,730
He was a tall man, with a long, white beard
and long, white hair.

173
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,400
He wore a big black hat and a long black robe
with stars on it.

174
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,760
"Tell me what you know!"

175
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,360
"First, you must promise to do something for
me."

176
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,130
"What is it?"

177
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,970
"I can't tell you now.

178
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,360
First, I must tell you about Odile, then I
will ask for something.

179
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Will you do it?"

180
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,850
"Tell me, before I turn you into a frog!"

181
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,130
The wizard was very much in love with Odile.

182
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:20,620
He would change his daughter into a frog because
he wanted to know about Odile.

183
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,240
"Today, I saw Odile talking to Prince Zigfried.

184
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,660
The Prince asked Odile to go to the royal
ball tonight.

185
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:34,060
He wants to marry her and free her from your
evil powers."

186
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,730
The wizard turned in a circle and pointed
his hand at the floor.

187
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:43,830
Fire came from his fingers and hit the floor.

188
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,210
The whole castle shook.

189
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,960
"I should have destroyed the Prince today,
when I saw him with Odile."

190
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,520
"You saw him, too?"

191
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,850
"Yes, at the lake.

192
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,420
I attacked him, but I was only an owl.

193
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,580
Odile knew this and she left him.

194
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,860
He must have followed her here."

195
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,870
"Oh yes Father, and he is so handsome!

196
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,380
You should see his face!"

197
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,520
"Silence!"

198
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,170
The wizard turned himself into a large, stone
ball.

199
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:18,080
He threw himself against the walls, making
the castle shake again.

200
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,370
Alone in her room, Odile felt the castle shaking.

201
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:31,610
She hid her head under a pillow on her bed;
she hated it when the wizard got angry.

202
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,090
The wizard changed back into himself in his
room.

203
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,649
"Now Father, you promised you'd do something
for me."

204
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,610
"I never promised you anything!"

205
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,670
"Oh, Father.

206
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,360
I want to go to the ball!

207
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,220
I want to marry the prince."

208
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,650
The wizard angrily raised his hand again.

209
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,540
Then, he thought of something.

210
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,320
Slowly, he lowered his hand.

211
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,150
"You would like to go to the ball, wouldn't
you?"

212
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,550
"Oh yes, Father!"

213
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,620
"And you would like to marry the prince?"

214
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,300
"Yes, I would."

215
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,480
"Then you will, and he will think that you
are Odile."

216
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,310
"Oh Father, what a wonderful idea!"

217
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,800
She put her arms around him.

218
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:31,910
His body was cold as stone, and his eyes were
filled with fire.

219
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:39,430
CHAPTER FOUR
A bird in a cage

220
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,810
Odile's room was at the top of the castle
tower.

221
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:49,190
Rocford had put her there, after he had taken
her from her parents.

222
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:57,100
She was the most beautiful Princess in the
land, and her parents were good and kind.

223
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,380
Rocford had asked her father if he could marry
Odile.

224
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,060
"We must ask my daughter what she thinks."

225
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,160
Odile was brought to the wizard.

226
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,980
"Odile, this man lias asked to marry you.

227
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,791
He says he is very rich and that he will make
you the happiest princess in the world.

228
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,290
What do you think?"

229
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,360
Odile looked into the wizard's eyes.

230
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,360
"Do you promise to love me forever, with all
your heart?"

231
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,170
Will you love me so much that you will not
think of what you want, even if it hurts you

232
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,580
to do this?"

233
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,950
The look in her eyes and her questions made
Rocford uncomfortable.

234
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,500
"Why do you ask me such questions?

235
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,290
I told your father I could give you everything
you could want."

236
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,950
The Princess smiled and turned her head away.

237
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,360
"I'm sorry Father, but I will not marry this
man.

238
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,630
He does not know what love is."

239
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,620
They did not know then that he was a wizard.

240
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,920
Rocford had looked like a Prince.

241
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,350
He wore beautiful clothes and looked very
handsome.

242
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,780
But, when he heard what Odile said to her
father, his face began to change.

243
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,830
It became old and ugly.

244
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,310
His clothes changed from blue to black.

245
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:23,250
"You do not know what you are saying, you
silly girl.

246
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,950
I do not have to ask for what I want.

247
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,320
I am a wizard, and I can do anything I please."

248
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:35,240
He waved his hands through the air, and a
fire started in the castle where the Princess

249
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,770
and her parents lived.

250
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,870
He had turned Odile into a small bird in a
cage, and carried her to his castle where

251
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,870
he locked her up in a tower.

252
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:59,029
The entire kingdom was destroyed by this fire,
and her parents were killed.

253
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:08,100
There was a real bird in a cage in Odile's
room at the wizard's castle.

254
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,600
The wizard had put it there so that Odile
would remember the power he had over her.

255
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,180
He only let her leave the castle as a swan
because he did not want other men to fall

256
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,590
in love with her.

257
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:30,740
At night, she stayed in her room talking to
the bird, who was her only friend.

258
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,380
She called the bird Patrice, because it was
her mother's name.

259
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,300
"Oh Patrice, what should I do?

260
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,900
The ball is tonight, and I am a prisoner here.

261
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,740
I believe the Prince loves me with all his
heart.

262
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,130
I saw it in his eyes.

263
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,040
He loved me even as a swan."

264
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,600
The bird began moving its wings wildly.

265
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,440
It always knew when something horrible was
about to happen.

266
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,380
"What is it Patrice, what are you afraid of?"

267
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,740
Odile heard keys in her locked door.

268
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,600
She put the bird and its cage behind a curtain,
because she did not want the bird to see what

269
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:17,659
was about to happen.

270
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:29,580
CHAPTER FIVE
Odet's New Voice

271
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,800
The wizard entered Odile's room with Odet.

272
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:40,040
Odet was the same age and height as Odile,
but she had dark hair.

273
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:47,110
However, she wasn't as beautiful as Odile,
and this made her very jealous.

274
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,400
The wizard spoke first.

275
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,059
"Sit down, Odile.

276
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:55,809
I would like to ask you something."

277
00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:01,420
The wizard waved his hand and a large and
very comfortable pink chair appeared.

278
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,710
Odile sat on it.

279
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,990
"Odet tells me that you would like to go to
the ball tonight.

280
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,570
Is that true?"

281
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,570
"Yes."

282
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,170
"If I let you go to this ball, will you promise
to marry me?"

283
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:20,320
"I have told you, I will only marry a man
who loves me and who I love."

284
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,000
"But you know I love you."

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,650
"If you loved me, you wouldn't keep me locked
up in this castle.

286
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,710
You wouldn't have killed my parents."

287
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,950
"You are a fool!

288
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,110
Would you like to marry the Prince?

289
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,110
Is that it?"

290
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,700
"He loves me more than you do."

291
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,480
"How do you know?

292
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,500
He left you here with me.

293
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,870
That shows you that you are wrong.

294
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,370
He is afraid of me.

295
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,140
He can't love you very much if he is afraid."

296
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,510
"He did it for me!

297
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,940
I asked him to do it!"

298
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,990
"And did you tell him that you would go to
the ball?"

299
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,990
"Yes."

300
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,990
"Then you lied.

301
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,020
You knew I would not let you go."

302
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,840
"I said I would try.

303
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,910
He knows that if I do not go it is not because
I do not want to."

304
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,840
"And how does he know this?"

305
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,010
"You do not have to cast a spell on someone
or make them rich to love you.

306
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,540
You understand it by looking in their eyes.

307
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,600
You know it by the way they speak and act."

308
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,830
"You are a dreamer!"

309
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,870
"And you have no heart!"

310
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,970
"Silence!"

311
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,310
The wizard raised both his arms and the castle
shook.

312
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:27,590
The curtain on the wall fell down, and the
wizard saw the bird in the cage.

313
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,150
"Ah, the bird."

314
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,100
"If you hurt that bird you are worse than
I thought."

315
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,520
The bird flew wildly as the wizard walked
towards it.

316
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,790
He picked up the cage.

317
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,260
"Now, why would I hurt this bird?

318
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,240
It is like me.

319
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,220
It has no heart.

320
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,240
It does not feel anything when I do this."

321
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,770
The wizard pointed his fingers at Odet.

322
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,470
She changed into Odile.

323
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,390
She had the same blonde hair, the same eyes.

324
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,500
She was even wearing the crown.

325
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,410
Odile stood up.

326
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:09,290
"Tonight, Odet will go to the ball as you,
Odile.

327
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,130
Zigfried will marry her and we will see what
true love is.

328
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,320
Your hearts are nothing compared to my magic."

329
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:21,420
"You may look like me Odet, but there is something
missing from your eyes.

330
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,270
The prince will know this."

331
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,910
"He does not love you Odile.

332
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,010
He only loves what you look like."

333
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,760
"I almost forgot!"

334
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,160
The wizard waved his hand.

335
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,280
"Odet, say something."

336
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,090
When Odet spoke, she sounded just like Odile.

337
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,610
"Hello, Prince Zigfried.

338
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,120
It's me, Odile.

339
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,730
I love you."

340
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,780
Odile ran to her bed, crying.

341
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,250
She fell on the bed and covered her face.

342
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,630
Rocford laughed loudly.

343
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:04,000
He took Odet out of the room and locked the
door behind him.

344
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,140
When Odile looked up, only the bird was with
her.

345
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:17,980
It too, had a tear in its eye.

346
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:24,230
CHAPTER SIX
The Ball

347
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,260
The ballroom in the palace was very big.

348
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,840
There were hundreds of men and women dancing
in the centre.

349
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,320
Along the walls there were long white tables.

350
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,020
They had candles and all kinds of food on
them.

351
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,570
At the top of the room, on a stage, were three
large chairs.

352
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,059
The Queen sat in the middle and Zigfried sat
on her right.

353
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,380
The chair on the left was empty.

354
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,780
It was for the Princess who would be Zigfried's
wife.

355
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:01,500
"Which Princess do you like the best?"

356
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,590
"The one I will choose is not here yet."

357
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,590
"But you have met them all, surely?"

358
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,510
"There is another one, mother, and she is
a surprise.

359
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,420
You will see."

360
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:22,170
Every time a new guest arrived, the ballroom
doors were opened, and everyone fell silent.

361
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:27,320
A servant called out the guests' names as
they entered.

362
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,320
Each time this happened, the Prince became
very excited.

363
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,970
But Odile never arrived.

364
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,440
It was almost twelve o'clock.

365
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,620
Zigfried had promised his mother that he would
choose a bride by midnight.

366
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,730
The two large doors opened.

367
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,480
"Please, let it be her!"

368
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,230
It was a giant cake with 18 candles on it.

369
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,480
Everyone in the room began to sing.

370
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,050
"Happy Birthday to you,

371
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:09,330
Happy Birthday to you,

372
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:16,600
Happy Birthday Prince Zigfried,

373
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:23,880
Happy Birthday to you!"

374
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,929
Zigfried and his mother walked towards the
enormous cake.

375
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:33,750
"Now, make a wish and blow out all the candles."

376
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,950
No one heard him, but Zigfried said,

377
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,030
"I wish Odile would come and be my wife."

378
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:47,020
He blew out the candles and everyone cheered.

379
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,530
The doors opened.

380
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,790
"Princess Odile."

381
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,630
It was Odet dressed as Odile.

382
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:03,370
She wore a long white dress and long white
gloves.

383
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,780
The gold crown was shining on her head.

384
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,340
She held a bouquet of flowers in her arms.

385
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,790
She smiled as she walked towards the Queen
and Prince.

386
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:20,660
She gave the Queen the flowers, then bowed.

387
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,390
"Mother, this is Odile, the Princess I met
in the forest."

388
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,330
"I knew your father.

389
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,990
I'm sorry.

390
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,500
I thought everyone had died in the fire.

391
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,690
You must be the only one who lived."

392
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,470
Odet did not know what the wizard had done
to Odile's parents.

393
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,920
She stopped smiling.

394
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,060
"Oh Mother, her story is too sad to tell.

395
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,060
Let us enjoy this evening together.

396
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,950
We are her family now."

397
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:55,170
"Do you mean you wish to choose Princess Odile
as your wife?"

398
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,669
"Yes, Mother, I do."

399
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:03,510
The Queen raised her hand for the men to sound
their horns.

400
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,090
Everyone was quiet.

401
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:17,180
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to announce
the engagement of my son, Prince Zigfried.

402
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:24,400
After tonight, he will be the King of this
land, and he has chosen Princess Odile to

403
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,500
be his wife."

404
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,050
Zigfried and Odet danced together.

405
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,410
Everyone around them clapped their hands.

406
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:41,400
"Odile, I knew you would come.

407
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,330
How did you escape from the evil wizard?"

408
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,720
"I...

409
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,000
I ran away."

410
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,500
"And he did not see you?"

411
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,420
The Prince stepped back so he could look at
Odet's eyes.

412
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,120
His heart sank when he saw those eyes.

413
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:04,110
They looked like Odile's, but there was something
missing in them.

414
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,930
He didn't love her.

415
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:10,179
Odet began to lie about her escape from Rocford.

416
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:13,010
"I saw a falling star in the sky.

417
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,340
I closed my eyes and made a wish.

418
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,900
When I opened them, I was in a carriage pulled
by horses.

419
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,610
That's how I got here.

420
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,460
It must mean we were meant to be together.

421
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,710
Oh Zigfried, tell me you will love me forever."

422
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:30,370
He held her close, because he did not want
to look in her eyes.

423
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:34,650
He knew he had loved Odile when he had first
seen her.

424
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,600
Now he didn't know.

425
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,560
He thought there must be something wrong with
him.

426
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:52,530
"Odile, I promise always to love you and never
leave you."

427
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,480
CHAPTER SEVEN
Odile Escapes

428
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:07,140
Odile stood at her window, looking at the
stars and the moon.

429
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:12,630
There were bars at the window, but they were
not necessary.

430
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,789
Her window was high above a river.

431
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:19,429
If she tried to escape, she would almost certainly
fall into the water and die.

432
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:24,220
Her bird, Patrice, chirped behind her.

433
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,450
She turned to look at the bird.

434
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,620
"Oh Patrice, I understand you.

435
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,680
I am in a cage, too.

436
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,590
But you must want to get out.

437
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,480
I'm sorry I never thought of it.

438
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,559
I have kept you locked up just like Rocford
has kept me locked up.

439
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:42,790
Because you are my only friend in this world,
I wanted you to stay.

440
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,870
But you must be free to fly."

441
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:49,430
Odile took the bird cage to the window.

442
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,290
She opened its small door.

443
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,400
"Fly away, Patrice, and be free!

444
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,800
Find another bird to love.

445
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,360
It is the only thing worth living for."

446
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,110
The bird flew from its cage, through the bars
on the window, into the night.

447
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:09,590
Odile closed her eyes.

448
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:15,900
She imagined that she was Patrice flying over
the forest and lake.

449
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,809
She flew into the garden of the palace, she
landed on a palace wall and looked into a

450
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:24,620
large window at the ball.

451
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,610
Beautiful women in beautiful dresses were
dancing with handsome men.

452
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:34,910
She saw the prince with his mother and the
cake with the eighteen candles.

453
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:41,270
Then, Odet entered the room dressed as her.

454
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:49,410
When she opened her eyes, she found to her
amazement that she was outside the palace

455
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,539
window.

456
00:28:50,539 --> 00:29:00,370
When she had set the bird free, she had also
set herself free.

457
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:05,400
Because she believed with all her heart in
love and freedom, everything that she imagined

458
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,950
came true.

459
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:14,110
The wizard knew that Odile hated him, and
it made him angry.

460
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:22,550
He wanted to make her love him, so he decided
to have a ball for her.

461
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:28,429
Using his magic, he made a large room full
of people dancing.

462
00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:34,420
He changed himself into a young man again,
the same young man he was when he had taken

463
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,550
Odile from her parents.

464
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,679
He went to her room with flowers.

465
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,460
He knocked on her door.

466
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,360
"Odile, I have a surprise for you."

467
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,100
There was no answer.

468
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,929
He couldn't even hear the bird.

469
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:54,929
"Odile, it's me, Rocford.

470
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:57,220
I've decided to take you to a ball."

471
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:04,330
When there was no answer and he heard nothing,
he became angry.

472
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,919
He made the door disappear.

473
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:14,180
His anger turned him back into the old, evil
man that he was.

474
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,650
He saw the bird cage on the floor.

475
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,350
The room was empty.

476
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,830
Roaring with anger, he turned himself into
an owl and flew from the castle towards the

477
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:32,900
palace.

478
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:41,230
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Prince Chases the Princess

479
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:46,730
When Odile saw Odet dancing with Zigfried,
she ran to the palace entrance.

480
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,110
The guards stopped her.

481
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,650
"Who are you?"

482
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,140
"My name is Princess Odile.

483
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,010
The Prince is expecting me."

484
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,010
"No.

485
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,370
Princess Odile has already entered.

486
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,550
You must be lying."

487
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,750
"Please, you must believe me.

488
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,700
That is not Princess Odile.

489
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,720
She is lying."

490
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,580
But the guards wouldn't believe her.

491
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,530
She ran back to the window and knocked hard
on it.

492
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,090
Everyone turned to look at her.

493
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:21,400
The Prince could not believe what he saw - two
Odiles.

494
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,850
He looked at Odet.

495
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,540
"What is going on?"

496
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,220
"I don't know.

497
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,520
The evil wizard must have changed someone
to look like me."

498
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,040
Odile kept knocking on the window.

499
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,250
She was crying.

500
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:42,010
Zigfried could now see that she had the same
eyes as the swan.

501
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,230
Rocford flew down next to Odile as the owl.

502
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,470
He held her in both arms.

503
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,411
"Did you think you could escape from me?"

504
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:52,919
The Prince ran from the ballroom.

505
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,039
He saw Odile fighting with the wizard.

506
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,500
"Take your hands off her, Rocford."

507
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
Rocford let go of Odile's arms.

508
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,950
"I should have killed you that day at the
lake.

509
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:06,500
But I will be happy to do it now."

510
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,020
The wizard lifted up his hand.

511
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,929
Odile stopped him.

512
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:11,929
"Wait!

513
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:12,929
Don't do it.

514
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:13,929
I'll go with you.

515
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:14,929
I'll do what you want.

516
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:16,420
Just don't hurt him."

517
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,070
"Odile, what are you saying?

518
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,480
Don't leave me again!"

519
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,610
She could not look at him, because if she
did, she would not want to leave.

520
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,700
"I'm doing this for us.

521
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,909
If you die, I will die with you.

522
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:34,720
It is better for us to live and hope to be
together one day."

523
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,360
Odet ran out of the palace.

524
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,140
She still looked like Odile.

525
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,920
"Who is this, then?"

526
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,200
"It is Odet, the wizard's evil daughter.

527
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,030
She only looks like me.

528
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,279
Look into her eyes and you will know."

529
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,900
"I knew it."

530
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,909
Odet also had magical powers.

531
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:55,890
She changed herself back to her real body.

532
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,340
"It is too late Zigfried.

533
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:01,920
You promised to marry me and love me forever.

534
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:09,020
If you do not keep this promise, you will
never be able to keep another."

535
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,929
Odet changed herself into a bird.

536
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:16,120
The wizard was an owl and Odile was a swan.

537
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,409
They flew together away from the palace, back
to Rocford's castle.

538
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:26,820
The Queen and many others came out of the
palace to see what had happened.

539
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,570
Zigfried went after Odile.

540
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,280
"Guards, bring me my horse."

541
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,940
"Zigfried, where are you going?

542
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,790
Where is the Princess?"

543
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,770
"She has gone away, Mother, and I must find
her."

544
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:43,590
The guards brought the prince a beautiful
white horse, and gave him his sword.

545
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,320
"Do you want us to call the men, Your Highness?"

546
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,760
"No, this is something I must do alone."

547
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,870
"Zigfried, do not leave the palace alone.

548
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,710
If something happens to you, we will be without
a king.

549
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,700
It is your duty to stay with me!"

550
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,710
"Mother, being a King means nothing if you
are not with the woman you love.

551
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,809
I would rather die than leave Odile with that
evil wizard."

552
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:20,819
The Prince spurred his horse on and rode quickly
towards the dark forest.

553
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:29,130
CHAPTER NINE
The Fir

554
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:35,560
Rocford, Odet and Odile flew onto the tower
of the castle.

555
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,470
They changed back into people.

556
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:42,240
Odile was weeping loudly.

557
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,740
The wizard just laughed his evil laugh and
said:

558
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,790
"Odile, now I know how to get you to marry
me.

559
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:54,450
If you don't, I will kill the Prince, and
you will watch him die."

560
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,170
"Father, you do not have to kill Zigfried.

561
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,530
He has already promised to marry me.

562
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,130
He cannot break such a promise."

563
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,380
"Neither of you has a heart.

564
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,369
How can you ever expect to be happy if you
know that someone does not love you?

565
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:11,240
But you will see.

566
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,190
Love is stronger than spells.

567
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:17,280
You will never succeed in getting what you
want."

568
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,480
At this, they saw Zigfried coming towards
the castle on his horse.

569
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,609
"We shall see which is stronger, love or hate!"

570
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:29,511
The wizard made a wall of fire appear in front
of Zigfried.

571
00:35:29,511 --> 00:35:33,060
Zigfried could only think of Odile.

572
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:37,160
He rode right through the fire without getting
hurt.

573
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,589
Odile said triumphantly: "You see.

574
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:42,150
I am right."

575
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:47,030
As she ran from the wizard, he tried to block
her way by making the doors close in front

576
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,030
of her.

577
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:52,300
But Odile just ran faster and escaped through
each one.

578
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,240
The Prince saw Odile on the steps going up
to the tower.

579
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,190
He took her in his arms.

580
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,850
"Odile, I will never let you leave me again.

581
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,330
Say that you will stay with me forever."

582
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,080
"I will, I will!

583
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,580
I love you Zigfried!"

584
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,690
The wizard appeared at the top of the steps.

585
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,880
Odet was behind him.

586
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,720
"You will not escape death this time, Zigfried."

587
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,490
The Prince took out his sword.

588
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,730
Odile tried to stop him.

589
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,870
"Do not fight him, Zigfried.

590
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,940
If he kills you, I will lose everyone I've
ever loved."

591
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,970
"You are right Odile.

592
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,550
Zigfried is only a boy.

593
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,100
He is no match for me.

594
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,630
Now, come back to your room, and let this
little boy go home to his mother."

595
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,490
"Rocford, your words will not discourage me.

596
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,100
I would kill you now, but I will give you
one last chance to live.

597
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,270
Let us leave in peace and never come near
Odile again."

598
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:50,359
"You really are a little boy if you think
that you can harm me."

599
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:56,869
Rocford raised his hand, and Odile flew through
the air to where Odet stood.

600
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:01,900
Zigfried ran at Rocford and tried to stab
him with his sword.

601
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,650
Rocford put his hand up.

602
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,650
The sword touched it and turned into water.

603
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:13,520
Without a sword, Zigfried attacked the wizard.

604
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,200
Rocford threw Zigfried down the steps.

605
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,609
He picked up a stick and turned it into a
sword.

606
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:25,099
He pointed it at Zigfried's heart as he lay
on the ground.

607
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,099
"Rocford!

608
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:27,099
Don't!"

609
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:29,810
"Say you will marry me Odile, and I will let
him live."

610
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,480
''Don't do it Odile!

611
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,320
Don't make yourself more unhappy just for
me!"

612
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,850
The wizard prodded Zigfried with the sword.

613
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:40,900
"And you have promised to marry me, Zigfried.

614
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,470
You said you would always love me."

615
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,960
"I said that because I thought you were Odile.

616
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,859
I would never marry you.

617
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:51,670
I would rather die."

618
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:57,130
Zigfried took the wizard's sword and pushed
it deep into his own heart.

619
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:00,800
"Zigfried, no!"

620
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,619
Something strange began to happen.

621
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:07,730
The castle began to shake.

622
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:13,880
Large stones fell from the ceiling, and Rocford
and Odet were killed.

623
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,230
Odile ran to Zigfried.

624
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,880
She took the sword out of his heart and pulled
his body out of the castle, before it fell

625
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:36,670
to the ground.

626
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:48,190
CHAPTER TEN
The Wedding

627
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:53,770
Dawn broke in the forest, but no birds sang.

628
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:58,109
The castle was nothing but a pile of stones.

629
00:38:58,109 --> 00:39:01,800
The only sound was Odile crying over Zigfried's
body.

630
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,510
"Oh Zigfried, my one true love!

631
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,500
Why did you have to die?"

632
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,230
At this, the Prince opened first one eye,
then the other.

633
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,930
"You're alive!

634
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,630
Oh, Zigfried!"

635
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,850
She hugged the Prince and cried tears of happiness.

636
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,890
"I love you, Odile.

637
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,720
I knew that my love was stronger than that
sword.

638
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,030
Nothing is more powerful than a person's heart.

639
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,940
Tell me you will marry me, and I will love
you forever."

640
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,560
"Of course I will Zigfried.

641
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,960
You have made my dreams come true.

642
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,890
We were right to believe in love!"

643
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:45,460
They left the old castle together on Zigfried's
horse.

644
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,320
When they came to the lake near the palace,
they saw Ozlowe.

645
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,080
He was not a statue anymore.

646
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,900
He stood scratching his head.

647
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,690
All of the wizard's spells had been broken
when he died.

648
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,900
The Prince was full of joy.

649
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,900
"Ozlowe!"

650
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,971
"Master Zigfried, I don't know what happened.

651
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,080
I was standing here about to shoot a swan."

652
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,630
"That will teach you never to kill anything.

653
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,390
This is Princess Odile.

654
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,700
She was the swan you tried to kill."

655
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,900
Ozlowe was very confused.

656
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,790
"Prince Zigfried, I think I'd better go to
bed.

657
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:27,640
I don't feel very well."

658
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,880
When the servants and the Queen heard about
Zigfried and Odile's marriage, there was a

659
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,280
big celebration.

660
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,270
All the people in the land and the surrounding
kindoms were invited to the wedding.

661
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:49,510
It took place at the edge of the lake, where
Zigfried had first seen Odile.

662
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:56,150
Odile wore a beautiful long wedding dress.

663
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,660
Zigfried's mother walked towards them.

664
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:03,780
"Zigfried, I want you to know that what you
did was right.

665
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,329
Though I asked you to stay at the palace,
you left for a better reason.

666
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:15,119
You should always follow your heart, especially
when it is full of love.

667
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,250
You father would be very proud of you."

668
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,060
Zigfried's mother was so happy she had tears
in her eyes.

669
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:28,130
The Prince took Odile's hands.

670
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,560
They stood together in front of the lake.

671
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,089
The Queen put the King's crown on Zigfried's
head.

672
00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:38,440
The priest spoke to the new King and Queen.

673
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,829
"Marriage is a wonderful thing.

674
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:49,630
And what makes this marriage special is that
the love you have for each other will affect

675
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,450
everyone in this land.

676
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:57,190
Through your happiness, we will become happy.

677
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:01,450
Through your love for each other, we will
love each other.

678
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,650
Is this what you want?

679
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:08,940
Is your love strong enough to lead a land
of people who need joy in their lives?"

680
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,100
Odile spoke first.

681
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,270
"It is."

682
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,610
"Of course, it is!"

683
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:22,119
"Then by the power that is given to me by
God, I pronounce you husband and wife."

684
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:29,690
At that moment a joyful chirp was heard and
a little bird flew from a rose bush and sat

685
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,390
on Odile's hand.

686
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,370
"Patrice, my little friend!

687
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,070
You're back!"

688
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,770
Then Odile turned to Zigfried and said:

689
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:44,180
"You see my beloved King, love is stronger
than anything in this world.

690
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:49,270
When you love somebody or something you never
lose them."

691
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:55,380
Zigfried looked lovingly into his bride's
eyes, they kissed and everybody cheered.

692
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,500
- THE END -
