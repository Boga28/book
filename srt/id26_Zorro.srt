CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,040
A Stormy Night

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:24,279
Reina de Los Angeles is a Spanish village
in southern California.

4
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:31,080
In the village there is a military presidio
with Spanish soldiers and their horses.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,710
There is also a Spanish church called a mission.

6
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,760
The Spanish friars live here.

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:47,190
All around the village there are big homes
with patios.

8
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:57,440
Tonight there is a terrible storm and it is
raining.

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,850
Inside the village tavern there are soldiers
and other men.

10
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,250
They are eating and drinking.

11
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,979
Sergeant Pedro Gonzales is at the tavern.

12
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,970
He is a big, strong man.

13
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,070
"What a horrible night!

14
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,110
It always rains in February.

15
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,220
Where is Zorro on this stormy night?" asks
one soldier.

16
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,450
"Zorro!

17
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,370
Don't say that name!

18
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:32,300
He is a bandit and a criminal,'' says Sergeant
Gonzales.

19
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,700
"He is the terror of southern California,''
says another soldier.

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,270
"People say that he takes from the rich and
gives to the poor.

21
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,830
He is a friend of the natives and the friars.

22
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,070
He punishes dishonest people," says an old
man.

23
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,070
"Ha!

24
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,100
Zorro is a big mystery.

25
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,480
Who is he?

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,229
Where is he from?

27
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,370
He wears a black mask and no one can see his
face.

28
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,710
He travels on the El Camino Real on his fast
horse.

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,200
He is very good with his sword," says the
Sergeant.

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:17,340
"Yes, and he leaves his mark - the Z - everywhere,"
says the old man.

31
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,110
"No one can stop him.

32
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:29,050
The Governor of California offers a big reward
for the capture of Zorro," says one soldier.

33
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,620
At that moment a man enters the tavern.

34
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,770
He is young and handsome.

35
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,980
He has black hair and dark eyes.

36
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,740
He has fine clothes.

37
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,940
"Don Diego Vega, my friend!" says Sergeant
Gonzales.

38
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,270
"Your clothes are wet.

39
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,190
Why are you out on this rainy night?"

40
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,849
Don Diego smiles and says, "I am going home,
but I am cold and wet.

41
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:58,330
I want something to drink."

42
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,100
"Come and stand near the fire," says the Sergeant.

43
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,900
"Here is a glass of wine."

44
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,210
"Thank you, my friend," says Don Diego.

45
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,520
"We are talking about Zorro.

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Everyone is scared of him, but I am not!

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,770
I am ready to fight Zorro and win!

48
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,250
I am a champion with the sword.

49
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,819
What do you think, Don Diego?" asks the Sergeant.

50
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,980
"Everyone talks about this mysterious man
with a mask.

51
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,240
Many people say good things about him," says
Don Diego.

52
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,540
"I want to fight him and capture him!

53
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,450
I want the big reward," says Sergeant Gonzales.

54
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,810
"No, no!

55
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,340
Don't talk about fighting.

56
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,870
I hate fighting and I hate violence.

57
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,390
I think Zorro is sincere.

58
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,760
He punishes only bad people.

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,840
He protects the poor, the natives and the
friars.

60
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,110
Let Zorro do his work," says Don Diego.

61
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,500
"You are a kind man.

62
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,360
You like music and poetry.

63
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,900
You don't understand, my friend.

64
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,650
You are rich and noble," says the Sergeant.

65
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,870
Don Diego smiles and says, "It's 6 p.m.

66
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,060
I must return to my hacienda.

67
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,900
Good night everyone."

68
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:26,500
He opens the tavern door and goes out into
the rain.

69
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,930
CHAPTER TWO

70
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,110
A Surprise Visit

71
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:37,479
At 7 p.m. the door of tavern opens.

72
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,750
Sergeant Gonzales and the other soldiers are
standing near the fire.

73
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,040
They are talking about Don Diego Vega and
his rich family.

74
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,249
They turn around and see a man.

75
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:54,779
He is dressed in black.

76
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,919
He has a black mask and a black sombrero.

77
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,100
It is Zorro!

78
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,960
"Good evening!

79
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,840
My name is Zorro!" says the masked man.

80
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,249
The men in the tavern are very surprised and
scared.

81
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:18,819
Sergeant Gonzales looks at him carefully and
says, "What do you want, bandit?"

82
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,590
Zorro laughs loudly.

83
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,389
He looks at Sergeant Gonzales and says," I
am here to punish you, Sergeant!"

84
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:29,779
"What do you mean?" says the Sergeant.

85
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,949
"You beat the poor natives.

86
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,660
I am a friend of the natives.

87
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,800
I am here to punish you."

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,479
"You idiot!

89
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:42,449
The governor wants you dead or alive!" says
Sergeant Gonzales.

90
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:45,889
He pulls out his sword and wants to fight.

91
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:49,009
At that moment Zorro pulls out a pistol.

92
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:52,869
He watches everyone carefully.

93
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:59,319
Sergeant Gonzales looks at the pistol and
says, "Courageous men don't use pistols.

94
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,080
They use swords.

95
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,379
Perhaps you are not courageous, Zorro?"

96
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:09,360
"This pistol is necessary because you have
many friends in this tavern.

97
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,199
Everyone must go near the fire and stay there!"
says Zorro.

98
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,080
"Now I have a pistol in my left hand and a
sword in my right hand.

99
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,979
I am ready to punish you."

100
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,059
"Fight, senor!" says the Sergeant.

101
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:23,819
They start fighting.

102
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,979
Their swords move quickly and make a lot of
noise.

103
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,840
The two men are good fighters.

104
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,550
Zorro is fast and light.

105
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,569
Sergeant Gonzales is slow and heavy.

106
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:39,559
Zorro jumps onto a table.

107
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,770
Then he jumps onto a chair.

108
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,289
The fight continues and Sergeant Gonzales'
sword falls onto the floor.

109
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:49,979
His face is white.

110
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,249
He is scared.

111
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:57,800
Zorro slaps his face and says, "This is your
punishment."

112
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,599
Then he makes a Z on the Sergeant's shirt
with his sword.

113
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,289
Zorro runs to the window.

114
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:11,389
He opens it and says, "Good evening, gentlemen!"

115
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:18,379
He jumps out of the window and disappears.

116
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:19,879
CHAPTER THREE

117
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,610
The Pulido Hacienda

118
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,039
The next day is warm and sunny.

119
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,830
Don Diego gets on his beautiful horse.

120
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,679
He rides to Don Carlos Pulido's big hacienda.

121
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:40,659
Don Carlos is a good friend of Don Diego's
family.

122
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:44,610
Both families are rich and important.

123
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,020
But the Governor does not like Don Carlos.

124
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,289
He creates problems for him.

125
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:53,800
He wants to take Don Carlos' land.

126
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,330
Don Carlos is happy to see his friend.

127
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,409
"Good morning, Don Diego.

128
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,449
What a nice surprise!

129
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:01,960
Come and sit in the patio."

130
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,439
"Thank you.

131
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,249
I am here to say something very important,"
says Don Diego.

132
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:10,410
"I am almost 25 years old.

133
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,889
My father wants me to get married and start
a family.

134
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:15,949
I am not interested in marriage.

135
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:21,389
I think love and marriage are boring but I
must obey my father.

136
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,119
How old is your daughter Lolita?" asks Don
Diego.

137
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:30,800
"Lolita is 18 years old and she is very beautiful,"
answers Don Carlos.

138
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,240
"You have a fine family.

139
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,539
With your permission ', I want to marry your
daughter," says Don Diego.

140
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,589
Don Carlos smiles and is happy.

141
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:43,669
"This is an honour for our family.

142
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,200
You have my permission!

143
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,770
Do you want to see Lolita?"

144
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,140
"I think I must!"

145
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,620
answers Don Diego.

146
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,970
Don Carlos calls her and she comes to the
patio.

147
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,740
Lolita is a lovely girl with long black hair
and dark eyes.

148
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,780
"Good morning, senorita.

149
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,450
There is something I must tell you," says
Don Diego smiling.

150
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,090
"I want to marry you and your father approves."

151
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,050
"Oh, senor!"

152
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,050
exclaims Lolita.

153
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,220
"You want to marry me!"

154
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,150
She is surprised and her face is red.

155
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,530
"Think about it today.

156
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,250
One of my servants can bring me your answer
tomorrow."

157
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,210
"But why can't you come tomorrow?" asks Lolita.

158
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,660
"Oh, your hacienda is far.

159
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,920
I get tired when I ride my horse.

160
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,320
I prefer to stay at home and rest."

161
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
"What!

162
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,590
You want to marry me and you don't want to
visit me!

163
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,180
Is this your idea of love?

164
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,140
I want to marry a strong, romantic man.

165
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,780
You are young and rich, but you are not strong
or romantic!

166
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,990
Do you have a heart?" says Lolita.

167
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,280
She is angry.

168
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,280
She runs away and tells her mother.

169
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,910
Doha Catalina says, "You are lucky, Lolita.

170
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,780
Don Diego is very rich.

171
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,650
He comes from a noble family.

172
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,160
The Governor likes his family.

173
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,580
This is a big opportunity for our family."

174
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,930
In the afternoon Lolita is alone in the patio.

175
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,800
She is thinking about Don Diego.

176
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,900
Suddenly she hears a noise and turns around.

177
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,170
She sees standing in front of her.

178
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,170
"Zorro!"

179
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,170
she whispers.

180
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,180
"Don't be afraid, senorita.

181
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,430
I only punish corrupt people.

182
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,720
I like your father because he is honest.

183
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,740
I am here to admire your beauty."

184
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,310
"What!

185
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,180
You must go away.

186
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,330
You are in great danger," says Lolita.

187
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,050
"You are beautiful and kind, Lolita," says
Zorro.

188
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,860
"Let me kiss your hand."

189
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,500
Zorro takes her small hand and kisses it.

190
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,710
Lolita looks into his eyes and smiles.

191
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,510
Then she runs into the house.

192
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,180
"What a courageous man!

193
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:13,610
He is a bandit but I like him," Lolita thinks.

194
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,930
CHAPTER FOUR

195
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,910
Captain Ramon

196
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,800
At 8 p.m. it is dinner time at Don Carlos'
home.

197
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,630
The family is sitting at the table.

198
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,180
Someone knocks at the door.

199
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,210
A servant opens it and Zorro appears!

200
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,810
Don Carlos, his wife and daughter stand up.

201
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,360
They are scared.

202
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,200
"Good evening," says Zorro.

203
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,150
"Don't be scared!

204
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,740
You are an honest man, Don Carlos.

205
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,680
I only want some food and drink."

206
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,840
Zorro goes to Lolita and whispers, "I cannot
forget this afternoon in the patio."

207
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,560
"You must not come here.

208
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,070
It is dangerous!"

209
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,550
whispers Lolita.

210
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,530
Suddenly a young Spanish soldier enters the
house.

211
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,790
He is Captain Ramon.

212
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,780
He wants to arrest Zorro.

213
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,360
Zorro takes out his sword and they fight.

214
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,810
The two men are good fighters.

215
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,970
"I want to arrest you, Zorro," says Captain
Ramon.

216
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,870
"You are a public enemy."

217
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,190
"You cannot arrest me!" says Zorro.

218
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:32,730
Zorro injures the Captain's shoulder with
his sword.

219
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,990
The Captain falls to the floor.

220
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,150
"Please help the Captain!"

221
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,560
Zorro says to Don Carlos.

222
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:47,750
Then he smiles at Lolita and rides away on
his horse.

223
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:53,210
Don Carlos' wife and daughter look after Captain
Ramon's injured shoulder.

224
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,530
The Captain likes beautiful Lolita.

225
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:02,200
"Don Carlos,'' says the Captain, "I like Lolita
very much.

226
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,290
I come from a good family and I am the Governor's
friend.

227
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,150
I am 23 years old and I am the Captain of
the Presidio.

228
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,170
May I court Lolita?"

229
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:18,020
"First, I must explain something," says Don
Carlos.

230
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,400
"Don Diego Vega wants to court Lolita too.

231
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:29,030
Lolita must choose her husband herself, but
you have my permission to court her!"

232
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:34,330
The next morning there is a lot of noise at
the Presidio Don.

233
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,120
Diego and other men are watching.

234
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,120
There are many soldiers on their horses.

235
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,730
They are listening to Sergeant Gonzales.

236
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,690
"Today is an important day.

237
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,970
We must find Zorro!

238
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,820
We must look in every hacienda and in every
home.

239
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,050
Remember the Governor's big reward.

240
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,040
Let's go!"

241
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,840
That morning Don Diego sends a letter to Don
Carlos:

242
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,010
My dear friend,

243
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,850
Sergeant Gonzales and his soldiers want to
arrest Zorro.

244
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,010
It is dangerous for you and your family to
stay at your hacienda.

245
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,000
Please come to my home in Reina de Los Angeles.

246
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,510
It is safe in my home.

247
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,040
I must go away for a few days.

248
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,240
Your friend,

249
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,870
Diego Vega.

250
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,310
Don Carlos receives the letter and says, "What
a generous invitation!

251
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,000
Don Diego wants to protect Lolita.

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,600
We must accept the invitation.

253
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,240
Let us go immediately!"

254
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,430
CHAPTER FIVE

255
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,940
Lolita is in Love

256
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,470
Don Diego's home in Reina de Los Angeles is
big and beautiful.

257
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,810
There are many rooms and many servants.

258
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,570
There is a big garden with trees and flowers.

259
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,230
Don Carlos and his family like it.

260
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,790
"Lolita!

261
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:08,120
Marry Don Diego and this beautiful home is
yours!" says Doha Catalina.

262
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,230
"I don't love Don Diego!

263
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,380
I don't want to marry him!" says Lolita.

264
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,340
"Lolita, tonight your mother and I must visit
our old friends," says Don Carlos.

265
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,430
"Can you stay at home alone?"

266
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,420
"Yes, of course.

267
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,590
There are many books in Don Diego's library.

268
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,480
I can stay here and read."

269
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,500
Lolita looks at the books.

270
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,560
"How strange!"

271
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,580
she thinks.

272
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:42,320
"Don Diego has books about love, passion,
adventure, horses and heroes!

273
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,440
But he isn't strong and is so lifeless !"

274
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,380
Suddenly there is a knock at the door.

275
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:56,320
A servant opens it and Captain Ramon enters.

276
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,560
He goes to the library and sees Lolita.

277
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,320
"I'm glad you are alone!

278
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,880
You are a very beautiful girl.

279
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,650
I have your father's permission to court you!

280
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:13,660
I know that Don Diego wants to marry you,
but I am superior in every way.

281
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,070
Don Diego has no courage.

282
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,980
He is a weak man.

283
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,940
I am the Captain of the Presidio."

284
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,820
"I am alone,'' says Lolita.

285
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,950
"You cannot stay here.

286
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,420
It is not right.

287
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,450
Please go away!"

288
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:34,290
Captain Ramon takes her hand and says, "Don't
run away, Lolita.

289
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,870
You are mine!

290
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,150
Kiss me!"

291
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,770
Lolita pushes him away and says, "I don't
want to kiss you.

292
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,320
Go away!"

293
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,290
"No, you are mine.

294
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,310
You must marry me.

295
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,420
Now kiss me!"

296
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,050
Lolita slaps the Captain's face.

297
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:02,790
At that moment Zorro appears in the library
and says, "Captain Ramon, you are a villain.

298
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,470
Don't touch Lolita!

299
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,289
Leave this house immediately!"

300
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:11,870
"I cannot forget this terrible insult," says
the Captain.

301
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,559
His face is red with anger.

302
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,449
Zorro opens the door and kicks him out.

303
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,679
"Thank you for your help, Zorro.

304
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,459
You are courageous and kind.

305
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:27,059
I love you!"

306
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,360
Lolita says.

307
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,389
"Dear Lolita, I love you too!"

308
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:32,960
says Zorro.

309
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,909
They embrace and kiss.

310
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:40,669
CHAPTER SIX

311
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:44,509
Friar Felipe

312
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:47,669
Captain Ramon returns to the Presidio.

313
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:48,809
He is furious.

314
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:56,350
"I must punish Lolita, her family and Zorro
for their insults!" he thinks.

315
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,220
"I must write a letter to the Governor.

316
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:05,039
I must tell him that Don Carlos Pulido and
his family are traitors.

317
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,980
They are Zorro's friends.

318
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,940
They help him."

319
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,370
He writes the letter and sends it to the Governor.

320
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:19,720
He smiles and says, "I want to see the Pulido
family in prison!"

321
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,509
"I want to see you in prison!" says a man's
voice.

322
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:28,379
Captain Ramon turns around and sees Zorro.

323
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:30,649
"You are a villain.

324
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:34,510
Fight me but don't hurt the Pulido family!"
says Zorro.

325
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:39,200
"Sergeant Gonzales, come quickly!" says the
Captain.

326
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,860
"Zorro is here."

327
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
Zorro disappears.

328
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,830
"I am here, Captain," says Sergeant Gonzales.

329
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,019
"Take all the soldiers and find Zorro!

330
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:52,049
We must capture him."

331
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:55,120
The soldiers follow Zorro.

332
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,840
The night is dark.

333
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,740
It is difficult to follow him because his
horse is very fast.

334
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,139
The next morning the soldiers return to the
Presidio.

335
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:10,159
They are tired and angry.

336
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,929
Zorro is still free.

337
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:16,889
There are many people in front of the Presidio
that morning.

338
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,789
Don Diego is there too.

339
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,850
Something is happening.

340
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:31,350
An old friar is standing before the magistrate
L The old friar is in chains.

341
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,009
"I am not a thief," says the old friar.

342
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,130
"I am a poor friar."

343
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,490
"What is happening?" asks Don Diego.

344
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,590
"This old friar is a thief.

345
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,450
He must be punished," answers the magistrate.

346
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,059
"That is impossible.

347
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,210
Friar Felipe is an honest man.

348
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,370
I know him," says Don Diego.

349
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:00,059
"No, you are wrong," says the cruel magistrate.

350
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:04,440
He calls two soldiers and says, "Whip this
friar 15 times."

351
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:12,720
The soldiers whip the old friar and he falls
to the ground.

352
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,350
Don Diego is very angry because Friar Felipe
is his friend.

353
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,259
He returns to his father's hacienda.

354
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:26,169
"Good afternoon, my son," says his father,
Don Alejandro Vega.

355
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:29,059
"I am happy to see you.

356
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:31,400
Come and tell me about Lolita.

357
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,090
Does she want to marry you?"

358
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,230
"I like Lolita, but she doesn't like me.

359
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,399
She likes romantic men.

360
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:42,200
What can I do?" asks Don Diego.

361
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,600
"Girls like courageous, romantic men.

362
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,659
You must talk about love.

363
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:50,950
You must play the guitar and sing love songs.

364
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,929
Give her some flowers.

365
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:54,629
This is what young men do.

366
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,480
Wake up, Diego!" says Don Alejandro.

367
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,509
"How ridiculous!

368
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,950
I cannot do these stupid things," says Don
Diego.

369
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,769
"You must try.

370
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:07,559
Lolita is a lovely girl," says Don Alejandro.

371
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,690
"There are many problems in my life.

372
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:17,960
I want to rest and meditate," says Don Diego.

373
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,590
CHAPTER SEVEN

374
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,980
The Avengers

375
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,399
In the evening the magistrate and his friends
are in the tavern.

376
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:35,019
They are laughing about the old friar.

377
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:39,429
Why are you laughing?" asks a mysterious voice.

378
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:43,999
They look at the door of the tavern and see
Zorro.

379
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:48,220
He has a pistol in one hand and a sword in
the other.

380
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,470
"Magistrate!

381
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:56,239
I am here to punish you," says Zorro. "Old
Friar Felipe is not a thief and you know it."

382
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:59,120
"I am an important magistrate.

383
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,340
I don't like friars because they are your
friends, Zorro."

384
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:10,899
Zorro gives a whip to the magistrate's friend
and says, "Now whip this corrupt magistrate

385
00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:12,350
15 times."

386
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,760
"But I cannot do this," says the friend.

387
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,179
"Whip him or I whip you!" says Zorro.

388
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:23,049
The friend whips the magistrate.

389
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:26,840
After the punishment the magistrate falls
to the ground.

390
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,809
''This is how I punish dishonest people,''
says Zorro.

391
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:36,450
The next day everyone talks about the magistrate's
punishment.

392
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:42,260
A group of young men want to help Captain
Ramon arrest Zorro.

393
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,279
They look for him in the hills and in the
valleys.

394
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:50,419
In the evening they go to the Vega hacienda.

395
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:54,919
When Don Alejandro sees them he says, "Why
are you all here?"

396
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:56,980
"We are looking for Zorro.

397
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,840
We want to capture the bandit and get the
reward.

398
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,330
But now we are tired and hungry.

399
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,179
Can you give us some food?"

400
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,879
"Yes, of course.

401
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,129
Please come in.

402
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:10,130
You can put your swords and pistols near the
door," says Don Alejandro.

403
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,460
"Sit down!

404
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,960
Eat these cakes and this wine."

405
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,009
Don Alejandro and Don Diego talk to the young
men.

406
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:24,309
At 9 p.m. Don Diego says, "Please excuse me.

407
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:26,840
I am tired and I am going to bed."

408
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,820
"Look, Diego, these young men are not tired.

409
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,909
It's only 9 p.m.

410
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:37,409
You are young but you are always tired," says
Don Alejandro.

411
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:40,850
"Yes, father, you are right.

412
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,940
Good night everyone!"

413
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,889
The others eat, drink and sing.

414
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:50,990
At midnight a masked man appears at the door.

415
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,909
"Look, it is Zorro!" says one of the young
men.

416
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:59,869
"Zorro, the bandit," they all say.

417
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:03,990
"Yes, I am Zorro, but I am not a bandit.

418
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:07,269
I have principles and I fight for them.

419
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:13,380
In California we have corrupt political men,
cruel magistrates and dishonest people.

420
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,369
I want to change this.

421
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:19,820
I fight to help the poor, the natives and
the friars.

422
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,149
What are your principles?"

423
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:27,080
"We want to help the poor, the natives and
the friars too," says one young man.

424
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,690
"Our principles are the same," says another.

425
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,159
"Come with me and we can fight together!

426
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,809
We can make California a better place to live,"
says Zorro.

427
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,269
"But who are you?

428
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:42,740
Where do you live?" asks a young man.

429
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,450
"I can't tell you.

430
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,169
It's a secret,'' says Zorro.

431
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:49,379
The young men talk together.

432
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:52,080
"Yes, we want to fight with you.

433
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,169
We want justice in California.

434
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:57,359
Our new name is The Avengers!" says a young
man.

435
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,840
"Yes, we are The Avengers," they all say.

436
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,900
"Good!

437
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,820
We now fight together!"

438
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,919
says Zorro and leaves.

439
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,539
CHAPTER EIGHT

440
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:14,029
The Escape

441
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:19,169
The Governor of California is here today,
says Sergeant Gonzales.

442
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,659
"Good!" says Captain Ramon.

443
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:24,019
"I must speak to him"

444
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:27,690
"Good morning, Captain Ramon," says the Governor."

445
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,460
I have your letter.

446
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,869
Thank you for the information about the Pulido
family.

447
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:36,059
They are Zorro's friends.

448
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:37,749
They are traitors.

449
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:41,250
We must put them in prison and kill them!

450
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,250
They are dangerous."

451
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,210
"What a good idea!

452
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,220
My soldiers can arrest them today," says the
Captain.

453
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:56,210
A group of soldiers goes to the Pulido hacienda.

454
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:00,879
They arrest Don Carlos, Dona Catalina and
Lolita.

455
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:03,490
They take them to prison.

456
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,779
Don Carlos is furious.

457
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:12,659
His wife and daughter cry.

458
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:16,889
When Don Diego hears about this, he goes to
the Governor.

459
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:21,480
He asks him, "Why is the Pulido family in
prison?"

460
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,489
The Governor answers, "They are Zorro's friends.

461
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:27,119
They help and protect him.

462
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,369
They are traitors!"

463
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:31,019
"I cannot believe this.

464
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:32,679
I know them.

465
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:34,549
They are honest people.

466
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:37,700
They don't help bandits," says Don Diego.

467
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,370
"You are wrong, Don Diego.

468
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,269
They must be punished.

469
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:46,929
The punishment for traitors is death," says
the Governor.

470
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:52,359
Early in the evening Zorro sends a message
to The Avengers.

471
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,760
The message says:

472
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,409
"Meet me at midnight at the lake Bring your
swords and pistols.

473
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,509
Pass the word to everyone."

474
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:06,350
At midnight Zorro and The Avengers meet at
the lake.

475
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:10,059
Every Avenger has a mask on his face.

476
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:15,470
Zorro says, "We are here to rescue Don Pulido
and his family.

477
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,690
They must escape from prison.

478
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,359
They are innocent.

479
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,679
We must be silent, enter the prison and help
them.

480
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,519
Francisco, you take Don Carlos to the village
of Pala.

481
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,590
Jose, you take Doha Catalina to the Vega hacienda.

482
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,409
I want to take Lolita to Friar Felipe.

483
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:37,919
They must hide for a few days."

484
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,500
Zorro and The Avengers rescue the Pulido family.

485
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,409
Don Carlos and Doha Catalina reach their destination.

486
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:51,379
The soldiers follow Zorro and Lolita.

487
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:55,629
Zorro's horse is very fast.

488
00:27:55,629 --> 00:28:00,350
Zorro and Lolita arrive at Friar Felipe's
hacienda.

489
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,639
Zorro says, "Can Lolita stay here with you
for a few days?

490
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:05,690
She is in danger."

491
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,179
"Yes, I can protect her," says Friar Felipe.

492
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:15,979
Zorro kisses Lolita and says, "Always remember
that I love you."

493
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:21,940
Then he rides away on his horse.

494
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,940
CHAPTER NINE

495
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,970
The Man behind the Mask

496
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,889
The soldiers follow Zorro all night.

497
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:32,590
They cannot capture him.

498
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:38,789
The next night Zorro silently enters the Governor's
home.

499
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:43,320
He wants to talk to the Governor and Captain
Ramon.

500
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,970
They are sitting near the fire.

501
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,690
Zorro enters and says, "Don't move and don't
make a noise.

502
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,869
I want to speak to you."

503
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:59,179
He has a pistol in one hand and a sword in
the other.

504
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:00,379
"Zorro!

505
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:01,739
Why are you here?"

506
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,320
asks the Governor.

507
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,350
"You are here to die!" says Captain Ramon.

508
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,460
"No," answers Zorro, "I am here to bring justice.

509
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,659
I am here to learn the truth.

510
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:17,169
Governor, you want to punish the Pulido family.

511
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:18,169
Why?"

512
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:20,119
"They are traitors.

513
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,399
They are your friends, Zorro!

514
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,820
They help you.

515
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,000
Your friends are my enemies,'' says the Governor.

516
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,909
"They are not traitors.

517
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,580
They do not help me.

518
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,149
They are not my friends," he says.

519
00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:35,109
"Look at this letter.

520
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:38,609
It accuses them," says the Governor.

521
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:43,230
Zorro reads the letter and says, "It is Captain
Ramon's letter.

522
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,049
He accuses the Pulido family."

523
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:53,119
Zorro looks at the Captain and says, "Captain,
you are a liar but I am here to punish you.

524
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:57,479
Tell the Governor the truth about the Pulido
family."

525
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:03,710
Zorro puts his pistol to Captain Ramon's head
and says, "Tell the Governor the truth or

526
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,799
I shoot!"

527
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:08,149
Captain Ramon is silent.

528
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:09,519
His face is white.

529
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,309
"Tell the truth, you liar,'' says Zorro.

530
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:16,679
"Yes, I am a liar.

531
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,129
The letter is not true."

532
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:22,200
"This is terrible!" says the Governor.

533
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,789
"You are a liar.

534
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:27,649
You cannot be the Captain of the Presidio!"

535
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:31,460
At that moment the Captain pulls out his sword.

536
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,789
He begins to fight Zorro.

537
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,799
It is a long sword fight.

538
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:41,299
In the end, Zorro kills Captain Ramon.

539
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:47,650
"The Captain is dead," says Zorro to the Governor.

540
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,220
Outside the Governor's home there are many
soldiers.

541
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,809
They want to capture Zorro.

542
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:58,609
He sees Lolita on her horse.

543
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:01,669
He shouts, "Lolita, come with me.

544
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:03,740
We must hide in the old tavern.

545
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,850
This time it is very difficult to escape.

546
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,049
There are soldiers all around us."

547
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:11,220
"I'm happy to be with you Zorro," says Lolita.

548
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,529
"I'm not scared."

549
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:17,639
Zorro and Lolita hide inside the old tavern.

550
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:20,389
The soldiers try to enter.

551
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:22,919
Zorro is ready to fight.

552
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,110
Suddenly The Avengers come to rescue Zorro
and Lolita.

553
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,349
They explain many things to the Governor.

554
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:33,929
The Governor pardons Zorro.

555
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:37,489
Zorro and Lolita walk out of the old tavern.

556
00:31:37,489 --> 00:31:39,460
They are free.

557
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,139
Everyone is happy and cheers.

558
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:50,840
The Governor says, "Now that you are free,
show us your face!"

559
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,840
"Yes!

560
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,020
Yes!" the people say.

561
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,750
Zorro takes off his black mask.

562
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,309
"It's Don Diego Vega!"

563
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,690
exclaims Sergeant Gonzales.

564
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,629
Everyone is very surprised.

565
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:07,129
"My son, Don Diego!

566
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:08,629
I can't believe it!"

567
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:10,690
exclaims Don Alejandro.

568
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:16,279
Lolita looks at him and says, "Is this true
or is it a dream?

569
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:18,229
Are you really Don Diego?"

570
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:19,979
"Yes, my love.

571
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:49,969
I am your Don Diego and your Zorro!" he says
embracing Lolita.
