00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,300
CHAPTER ONE
Gluttony

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,530
Somerset looked at the clock.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,940
It was almost 2 a.m.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,509
He had been in bed for more than an hour,
but he was still awake.

5
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,890
He had too much to think about.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:25,900
After twenty-three years as a homicide detective,
it was never easy for him to go to sleep.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:31,130
A homicide detective sees humanity at its
very worst.

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,559
He sees murders of every imaginable sort.

9
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,020
People killed with guns, knives, poison.

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,370
Husbands killing wives, and wives killing
husbands.

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:52,219
Children killing parents, friends killing
friends, and people killing strangers.

12
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,510
Sometimes to rob them, sometimes for no reason
at all.

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,260
But now Somerset was leaving.

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,000
He had only seven more days left before he
retired.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,170
Then he could leave the city, forget the crime
he had seen, and live quietly in the country.

16
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,500
He had seen enough of the violence and crime
of the city.

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:26,250
His pictures and his books were packed and
ready to move to his new house in the country.

18
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,520
Only seven more days.

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,030
He thought of how long he had lived in the
city.

20
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,570
He had been married twice.

21
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,990
At one time he had wanted to have children
- but not in the city.

22
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,920
He knew what living in the city did to children.

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,670
But deep in his heart, he felt that it wasn't
right not to have children.

24
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:58,549
It isn't too late, he thought, forty-five
isn't too old to have children.

25
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,610
He still might meet someone.

26
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,450
It was possible.

27
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,410
Anything was possible once he got the hell
out of here.

28
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,620
Suddenly his stomach was tight.

29
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,520
Was he making a mistake?

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,820
He'd lived his whole life in the city.

31
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,750
What if he hated the country?

32
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,330
He tried to stop himself thinking and go to
sleep.

33
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,670
It will all be OK, he told himself.

34
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:38,210
Only seven more days of crime, of the noise
and mess and violence in the city, and then

35
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:43,110
his life would start all over again.

36
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,120
That afternoon he had visited the house he
was buying in the country.

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,281
The house was old and needed some fixing,
but he liked it.

38
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:53,281
On the way back to the city, he sat on the
train and watched the farms and fields go

39
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:54,281
by.

40
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:55,281
But the countryside became drier and the farms
turned into desert.

41
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,281
Soon he began to see burned cars out there
on the dry, empty land.

42
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:57,281
He knew they were getting close to the city.

43
00:02:57,281 --> 00:02:58,281
Somerset could see smoke and dust hanging
over the city like the hand of an angry God.

44
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:59,281
When the train stopped, he didn't want to
get out.

45
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:00,281
He wanted to stay in his seat until it took
him back to his new home.

46
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,281
But it was only seven days, he told himself.

47
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,281
He could manage another seven days.

48
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:03,281
After twenty-three years, what is seven days?

49
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,281
Out on the street, as he waited for a taxi,
the terrible reality of the city hit him hard.

50
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:05,281
The noise of the traffic, people running,
shouting, screaming, and nobody caring.

51
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:06,281
A crazy, homeless man was trying to take a
tourist's suitcase.

52
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:07,281
"I'll get you a taxi," the crazy man shouted.

53
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:08,281
"I know how.

54
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:09,281
I'll get you one."

55
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:10,281
But the tourist, whose wife and daughters
were afraid, didn't want his help.

56
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:11,281
They didn't want him there.

57
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:12,281
Somerset was going to help, but he couldn't
do it.

58
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,281
He couldn't be responsible for everything
if he was ever going to escape this place.

59
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,281
People had to solve their own problems.

60
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:15,281
He got into a taxi and told the driver to
take him home.

61
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:16,281
On the way they passed an ambulance and two
police cars.

62
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:17,281
Somerset could see a body on the sidewalk.

63
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,281
He saw the bloody face and wondered if the
man was still alive.

64
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,281
On the next street a fight began.

65
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,281
A crowd stood around the fighting men, shouting.

66
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:21,281
As they passed, Somerset sat back in his seat
and closed his eyes.

67
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,281
He didn't want to see any more.

68
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:23,281
"Where did you say you're going?"

69
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:24,281
the driver asked.

70
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:25,281
Somerset opened his eyes.

71
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:26,281
"Far away from here," he said.

72
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:27,281
***

73
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,281
Yes, he thought.

74
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:29,281
Far away from here.

75
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,281
He closed his eyes, and started to breathe
more deeply...

76
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:31,281
In the morning the phone woke him from a deep
sleep.

77
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:32,281
There had been another murder.

78
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:33,281
As he got out of bed, he wished he didn't
care as much as he did.

79
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,281
It would make the next seven days a lot easier.

80
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,281
***

81
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,281
When Somerset arrived at the crime scene,
the workers from the police department were

82
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,281
taking photographs and looking for fingerprints.

83
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:38,281
The body was on the floor in a body bag, waiting
to be taken out.

84
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:41,350
There was a lot of blood on the wall, and
a gun on the floor next to the body.

85
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,120
"The neighbors heard them screaming at each
other," said a policeman.

86
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:53,260
"The man who lives in the back said it was
going on for about two hours, which wasn't

87
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,580
unusual with these two."

88
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:03,020
A young man with short hair and a black leather
jacket came into the room.

89
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,700
"Detective Somerset?"

90
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,700
he asked.

91
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,960
"I'm David Mills.

92
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,270
Today's my first day on homicide."

93
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,470
Somerset shook his hand, but said nothing.

94
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,630
Mills watched him walking around the room.

95
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:29,200
Somerset was a thin, middle-aged black man
with heavy bags under his eyes and a sad face.

96
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:36,090
Everyone at the precinct had smiled when Mills
said that he was going to start working with

97
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,910
Somerset.

98
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,180
Mills wondered why.

99
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,600
"Where was your last job?"

100
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,270
Somerset asked him.

101
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,570
"Springfield.

102
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,750
It's up north"

103
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,510
"How many homicides you get a year up there?"

104
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,910
"Oh, about sixty or seventy."

105
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,590
"We get that many a month here."

106
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,820
"Yeah, but we only had three homicide detectives
up there."

107
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:11,180
Mills didn't want to get into a fight in his
new job, but he had left Springfield because

108
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,570
he thought that it was too small and unimportant.

109
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,810
He wanted to do real detective work.

110
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,940
He wanted to feel that he was doing something
that mattered.

111
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,880
Somerset thought Mills must be a fool for
wanting to work in the city.

112
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:37,500
"For the next seven days," he said, "I want
you to remember that you're not in Springfield."

113
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,810
Early the next morning, Mills was awake, sitting
up in bed.

114
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:49,370
Tracy, his wife, was asleep by his side.

115
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,390
She didn't like the city with its noise and
dirt and crime.

116
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:59,000
Mills studied his wife's face.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,800
There was always something about Tracy's face
- she had big eyes and a small mouth - that

118
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,200
reminded him of a child.

119
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,540
He thought that it made her more beautiful
when she smiled.

120
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,500
But she didn't smile so often now that they
had moved to the city.

121
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,410
Her face always looked worried.

122
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,940
Even in her sleep she worried.

123
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,860
Maybe this move is a big mistake, thought
Mills.

124
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,230
Maybe Somerset is right.

125
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,700
Maybe Springfield is a better place.

126
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,139
No, he thought.

127
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,660
He was right to move.

128
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,300
But he was happy that Somerset was retiring.

129
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,810
He understood why everyone at the precinct
wanted him to go.

130
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,830
The phone rang.

131
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,220
Tracy jumped up.

132
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,280
"What is it?"

133
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,460
she cried.

134
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,590
Mills picked up the phone before it rang twice.

135
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,360
"It's OK," he said.

136
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,280
"It's only the phone."

137
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,050
It was Somerset.

138
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,490
"Meet me at 377 Baylor Street," he said.

139
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,800
The way he spoke annoyed Mills.

140
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,580
"What've we got?" he asked.

141
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:32,389
"Possible homicide," said Somerset, and hung
up before Mills could ask anything more.

142
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:33,389
***

143
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:39,180
Outside the apartment block on Baylor Street,
Somerset was already waiting when Mills arrived.

144
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,900
"We'll need some lights," said Somerset.

145
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,680
"The electricity is off inside."

146
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,920
"Any guess about the time of death?"

147
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,120
Mills asked Somerset.

148
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,770
"No, but it seems he's been sitting with his
face in a plate of spaghetti for forty-five

149
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,419
minutes now."

150
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:08,870
Inside the apartment, there were dirty pots
and dishes and open cans and boxes of food

151
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,410
everywhere, and there were insects feeding
on the garbage.

152
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,449
The smell was terrible.

153
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:25,610
A very fat man was sitting at the table with
his face in a plate of spaghetti.

154
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,140
They had never seen anyone as fat as this
man.

155
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,669
Somerset saw that his hands and feet were
tied.

156
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,270
He couldn't understand what had happened.

157
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,700
Then the Medical Examiner came into the room.

158
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,830
He took no notice of the detectives.

159
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:51,870
"Do you think it was poison?" asked Mills.

160
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,650
Instead of answering, the doctor lifted the
man's face out of the spaghetti.

161
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,000
"He's dead," he said.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,710
"We know that for sure.

163
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,950
Point that light you're holding at his mouth."

164
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,100
"What do you see?"

165
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,740
Somerset pointed the light and looked closer.

166
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,640
"There are little blue pieces around his mouth.

167
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
See?"

168
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
"Yeah.

169
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,120
So what is it, Doc?"

170
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,680
"Don't know.

171
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,990
I never saw anything like that before."

172
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,550
He let the man's head back down into the spaghetti.

173
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,550
***

174
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,770
The dead man's name was Peter Eubanks.

175
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,750
The body was in the Medical Examiner's room,
where Mills and Somerset were talking to the

176
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,560
doctor.

177
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:53,920
Eubanks had always been heavy, but not as
heavy as he was when he was found dead: 304

178
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,550
pounds.

179
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:01,480
The doctor said some of his bones were bending
under the weight.

180
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,760
Mills wondered whether the man died of poison,
but the doctor didn't think so.

181
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,360
He explained why, showing Mills parts of the
inside of the body, which was cut open for

182
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,500
examination.

183
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,279
Mills had to make himself look.

184
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,360
"Are you saying that he died from eating too
much?"

185
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,370
Mills asked.

186
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,370
"Yes.

187
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,649
I think that's exactly how he died."

188
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:35,310
"What about these marks on the back of his
head?"

189
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,310
Somerset said.

190
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,220
"It looks like a gun was pressed against his
head."

191
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:47,890
"Very possible, if the gun was pushed hard
enough against the skin."

192
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:53,140
Somerset was looking at a row of glass jars
on a table.

193
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:59,560
"Doctor," he said, "I want to ask you about
one of these."

194
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,820
He picked up a clear glass jar.

195
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,550
"Were these blue things found around the victim's
mouth?"

196
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,970
"No."

197
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,890
The doctor picked up another jar.

198
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,730
"These are the ones from around the mouth.

199
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,589
Those you're holding I found in the stomach."

200
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:23,589
"Any idea what this stuff is?"

201
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:25,190
The doctor shook his head.

202
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,670
"I have no idea."

203
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,350
He covered the victim's body.

204
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,720
Now he had more work to do.

205
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,660
"Four bodies came in this morning," the doctor
said.

206
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,450
"So we've been very busy here."

207
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:47,560
"Let me know as soon as you find out anything
about this blue stuff, will you, Doc?" said

208
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,150
Somerset as he went out.

209
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,150
***

210
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:58,020
Back at the precinct house later that afternoon,
the captain was sitting at his desk reading

211
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,000
the papers on the "fat man" case.

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,610
The victim no longer had a name.

213
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,459
He was just "the fat man".

214
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:13,720
Mills waited while the captain read the Medical
Examiner's report.

215
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:21,649
The captain was about fifty, with big bags
under his eyes and bad skin.

216
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:27,830
Mills could see that Somerset had worked hard
on this case.

217
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,500
He wondered what Somerset was really like.

218
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,990
What would Somerset do when he was in danger?

219
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:41,470
Would he think more quickly than Mills did
on the night that Rick Parsons was...

220
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,310
Mills and Rick were old school friends.

221
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,149
Rick was the best policeman they ever had
in Springfield.

222
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:56,800
But that night, when they were working on
a murder case together, Mills thought that

223
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,830
the murderer wouldn't shoot at the police.

224
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:07,580
When Mills saw that the man had a gun, he
hadn't fired quickly enough.

225
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,810
He'd waited a little too long.

226
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:17,580
The man fired at Rick, and now Rick would
be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

227
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:24,940
And no matter what Rick and Tracy said, Mills
thought, he was to blame.

228
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,340
The captain was shaking his head over the
papers.

229
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,150
"This is very hard to believe," he said.

230
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,450
"Do you believe it?"

231
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,750
Somerset nodded.

232
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,430
"The victim had to choose.

233
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,769
Eat or be shot.

234
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:47,070
The killer put food in front of him, and made
him eat it.

235
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,550
Perhaps this went on for twelve hours or more.

236
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,000
The killer kept him awake and made him keep
eating."

237
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,770
The captain looked worried.

238
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,800
Mills understood how he felt.

239
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,180
He hadn't wanted to believe it either.

240
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,959
"I think this is just the beginning," said
Somerset.

241
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,810
"We don't know that," the captain said sharply.

242
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,000
"We have one dead man.

243
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,080
Not four.

244
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,500
Not three.

245
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,100
Not even two."

246
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,360
"Then what's the reason for it?"

247
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,959
Somerset looked tired.

248
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,590
The captain was angry.

249
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,270
"Don't start, Somerset," he said.

250
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,240
"Don't start imagining things before they
happen.

251
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,540
You have no evidence that there will be another
murder."

252
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,080
Somerset was too tired to argue.

253
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,470
"I want to be taken off the case," he said.

254
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,730
"You've only got a week left," the captain
said.

255
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,310
"What difference does it make?"

256
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,870
"This can't be my last case," said Somerset.

257
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,339
"It'll go on and on.

258
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,480
I don't want to leave it unfinished when I
go.

259
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,760
And, if you want my opinion," Somerset pointed
at Mills.

260
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,620
"This shouldn't be his first case."

261
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,959
Mills jumped up.

262
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,830
"This isn't my first case!" he shouted.

263
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,170
"You know that."

264
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,270
"This is too soon for him.

265
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,480
He isn't ready for one of these," said Somerset.

266
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,720
"Look," the captain said.

267
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,010
"I don't have another detective I can give
this to.

268
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,060
We don't have enough people.

269
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,110
You know that."

270
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,260
"Give it to me, Captain," said Mills.

271
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,310
"I can manage it."

272
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:52,000
The captain turned and stared Somerset in
the eye.

273
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,830
"You serious about this killer?

274
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,810
You think he's just getting started?"

275
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,910
Somerset closed his eyes and nodded.

276
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,480
"Hell!"

277
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,790
the captain said.

278
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:11,540
"As often as I've wanted you to be wrong,
you rarely are.

279
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:17,060
That's why I'm leaving you on the 'fat man'
case, Somerset.

280
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,940
As for you, Mills, I'm putting you on another
case."

281
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,149
"But Captain..."

282
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,370
"Not buts.

283
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,980
That's all.

284
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,209
Now go."

285
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:34,910
Mills was so mad he wanted to throw a chair
through the window.

286
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,720
He wanted to stay with Somerset.

287
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,570
He just didn't want them to think of him as
a beginner.

288
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:46,180
He wanted to show the captain that he could
manage on his own.

289
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,100
Even in the city.

290
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,100
"You heard me, Mills.

291
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,690
Get going," the captain ordered.

292
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:59,240
CHAPTER TWO
Greed

293
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,170
The next morning Somerset was in his office
when the captain walked in.

294
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,600
"Have you heard?"

295
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,290
the captain asked.

296
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,410
"Heard what?"

297
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,399
"Eli Gould was found murdered last night."

298
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:20,059
Gould was possibly the top criminal defense
lawyer in the city.

299
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,339
No criminal was too nasty for Gould to defend.

300
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:32,119
If they could pay enough, he would do anything
to defend them and help them escape punishment.

301
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:35,909
It didn't matter how terrible their crime
was.

302
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:41,350
"Someone broke into his office and killed
him," the captain said.

303
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:47,789
"They wrote the word 'greed' on the floor
in his blood."

304
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:49,830
"Greed?"

305
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,369
Somerset could think of worse things that
could be said about Eli Gould.

306
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:56,649
"I'm putting Mills on the case.

307
00:17:56,649 --> 00:17:59,100
I told him he would soon have a case.

308
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,539
I just wish it wasn't this."

309
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,529
Somerset went back to his typing.

310
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:09,809
"I'm sure he'll do fine."

311
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:14,080
The captain was shaking his head and looking
doubtful.

312
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,509
"You won't like it out there in the country.

313
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:21,910
You know you're not really leaving.

314
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,669
You only think you can leave."

315
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:29,129
"I can't live here anymore," said Somerset.

316
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:33,350
"I don't understand this place anymore.

317
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:39,429
People used to kill somebody for a purpose,
even if it was a stupid purpose.

318
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:45,220
Now they do it for the hell of it, just to
see what will happen."

319
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,460
The captain let out a deep breath.

320
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,779
"I hear what you're saying.

321
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:54,600
It's just that I don't want to lose you.

322
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,529
They don't make detectives like you anymore."

323
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:01,820
"You've got Mills.

324
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
He'll be OK."

325
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,899
"But he won't be you."

326
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:10,980
Not if he knows what he's doing, Somerset
thought.

327
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:18,769
"Oh, I almost forgot," said the captain, holding
up ajar with the little blue pieces in it.

328
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:22,090
"These were found in the fat man's stomach.

329
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,409
The doctor thinks that the killer made him
eat them.

330
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:30,940
They're pieces of the floor."

331
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
***

332
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,120
Somerset went back to Eubanks's apartment.

333
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,029
He wanted to find where the pieces of blue
floor had come from.

334
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:46,899
He looked everywhere, but couldn't find anything
until he felt under the front of the refrigerator.

335
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:51,309
Then he could see that was where they came
from.

336
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:56,580
The larger pieces in Somerset's jar fit the
holes.

337
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:04,739
Someone had moved the refrigerator and broken
pieces of the floor cover.

338
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:10,029
Somerset managed to pull the refrigerator
away from the wall so that he could see behind

339
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:11,690
it.

340
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:19,899
The dirt on the wall was cleaned off and the
single word GLUTTONY was written there.

341
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:25,850
A clean, white envelope was pinned to the
wall.

342
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,259
Somerset's blood froze.

343
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:34,809
He reached for the envelope, but it was a
little too far away.

344
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:35,809
***

345
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:43,139
Later, in his now empty apartment, Somerset
was thinking about what he'd found behind

346
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:46,480
the fat man's refrigerator.

347
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,169
If he said nothing about it, there would be
no link between the murders of Eubanks and

348
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:53,710
Gould.

349
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,460
Then it would be Mills's problem.

350
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,799
But he couldn't do that...

351
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,029
Mills wasn't ready for Mills.

352
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:07,600
He thought he was, but he wasn't.

353
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,789
It was still Somerset's problem.

354
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:15,220
So now he had GLUTTONY and GREED.

355
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,220
***

356
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:22,360
Mills was excited when he saw the note Somerset
had found behind the fat man's refrigerator.

357
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:29,220
"So we have a link between the two killings,"
he said.

358
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,529
He read the note again.

359
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:39,239
Long is the way; and hard, that out of hell
leads up to the light

360
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:43,639
"But what does it mean?

361
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:45,580
Is he trying to tell us something?

362
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,039
It just seems crazy to me."

363
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,669
It was hard for Somerset to control himself.

364
00:21:52,669 --> 00:22:02,669
But instead of telling Mills he was a fool,
he held up photos of the words GREED, in blood,

365
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,210
and GLUTTONY.

366
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:10,009
"Have you ever heard of the seven deadly sins,
Mills?

367
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:19,129
Greed, gluttony, wrath, envy, sloth, pride,
and lust."

368
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:23,679
Understanding slowly showed on Mills's face.

369
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,750
"You think he's going to do one for each sin?"

370
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,340
"It seems so, doesn't it?"

371
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,340
"Oh, no..."

372
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,360
Mills was shocked.

373
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,609
"So we do have a link?"

374
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:44,840
Oh, no, is right, thought Somerset.

375
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,779
"You wanted the big time," he said.

376
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:49,769
"Well now you've got it.

377
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:55,659
There are going to be five more murders if
we don't find the killer."

378
00:22:55,659 --> 00:23:03,200
With Mills leading the investigation after
his retirement, Somerset had a feeling the

379
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,609
killer would do them all, no trouble.

380
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:10,840
It wasn't that Mills was no good.

381
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:17,659
He just didn't know anything about this sort
of stuff - about serial killers.

382
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:21,729
This wasn't Springfield.

383
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:25,090
As much as Somerset wanted to leave, he couldn't.

384
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,899
Not now.

385
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:30,559
He couldn't just leave it with Mills.

386
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,299
He had to go on with the investigation.

387
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:41,139
Mills looked at his notes as he walked around
Gould's office.

388
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:46,220
On the wall behind the desk, there was a big
oil painting.

389
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:55,299
It was a modern painting, just lines and shapes
of color - red, green, and black.

390
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:59,899
On the desk, there was a weighing machine
with dried blood on it.

391
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:06,059
The letters in blood on the floor had turned
red-brown.

392
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:13,450
Mills wanted to find some evidence, something
that they had all missed.

393
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:19,620
He wanted to show that Somerset wasn't the
only one who knew how to do detective work.

394
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:27,039
Mills believed that the crime scene was the
place to solve the crime.

395
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:37,620
There had to be some evidence, some clue,
something that would help them find the killer.

396
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,619
He picked up a photograph of a middle-aged
woman.

397
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:49,399
She had a false smile, too much make-up, and
colored red hair.

398
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:52,450
It was Mrs. Gould.

399
00:24:52,450 --> 00:25:01,649
On the glass over the photo, the killer had
drawn circles around her eyes in blood.

400
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:03,269
Was this a clue?

401
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,429
Mills wondered.

402
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:08,979
Why had the killer drawn these circles?

403
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:10,889
Was she the next victim?

404
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:13,950
Had she seen something?

405
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,539
Or did the killer want them to see something?

406
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:21,460
He couldn't understand it.

407
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,849
What was it he couldn't see?

408
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:31,799
Was it something so big and obvious that they
were looking at it but couldn't see it?

409
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,799
***

410
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:39,970
The next morning, Somerset was sitting at
his desk working on the "fat man" case when

411
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,169
Mills came in.

412
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:46,539
Mills was carrying a pile of papers on the
Gould case.

413
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:55,090
He put it down on the desk and began studying
photographs of Gould's office.

414
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:01,479
At first Somerset wanted to help him, but
then he thought that Mills should learn to

415
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:03,919
work by himself.

416
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:10,320
He would learn finally, and Somerset was leaving
in three more days.

417
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:17,380
In this case, though, people would probably
die while Mills was learning.

418
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:23,149
He needed some help, just to show him the
right direction.

419
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:25,269
Somerset put down his pen.

420
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:31,499
"You know this is a serial killer we're looking
for here," he said.

421
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:38,289
"You really think I'm a fool!" shouted Mills,
angry at Somerset again.

422
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:42,419
"No, I didn't say that."

423
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:45,690
Somerset was sorry he had said it the wrong
way.

424
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,429
"It's just that we haven't talked about that.

425
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:52,700
I think we should."

426
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,419
"I don't."

427
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,129
"Why not?"

428
00:26:56,129 --> 00:27:02,779
"Because as soon as we call him a serial killer,
the FBI will take over the case.

429
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:04,970
Then we'll be working for them."

430
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,970
"But..."

431
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,960
"No," said Mills.

432
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,509
"I don't even want to talk about it."

433
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:15,190
Just then the phone rang.

434
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,529
It was Tracy, Mills's wife.

435
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:24,260
She wanted to talk to Somerset, but Somerset
couldn't imagine why.

436
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,120
"Detective Somerset?"

437
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
she said.

438
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,909
"I wondered if you would like to come and
have dinner with us tonight."

439
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:39,909
"Well, that's very nice of you."

440
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:42,309
Somerset's voice was uncertain.

441
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:46,499
"I'm a very good cook," she said.

442
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:49,450
"And I've heard a lot about you.

443
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,840
I would like to meet you before you leave."

444
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
***

445
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,809
Later that evening, Mills seemed uncomfortable
as he and Somerset walked up the stairs to

446
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:06,320
Mills's apartment.

447
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,239
Somerset knew that Mills didn't like the idea
of dinner together, but he wasn't sure why.

448
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:18,529
In the dining room, the table was carefully
prepared for three.

449
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:22,090
A young woman came out of the kitchen.

450
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:27,570
"Hello, men," she said quietly.

451
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:33,820
Somerset thought that she had a pretty smile,
"Hello, Tracy," he said.

452
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,029
"Nice to meet you."

453
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:39,759
"Please sit down," Tracy said.

454
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,009
"Can I get you something to drink?"

455
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:45,529
"No, thanks.

456
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:49,029
I'm fine just now."

457
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:51,409
Somerset took off his jacket.

458
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:53,470
He nodded toward the kitchen.

459
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:58,039
"Smells good," he said.

460
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:01,649
Tracy was staring at Somerset's gun.

461
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:04,200
He could see that it made her nervous.

462
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:13,679
"I never wear a gun at the table," he said,
taking it off "It isn't polite."

463
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,559
Tracy tried to laugh.

464
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:22,390
"You know," she said, "no matter how often
I see guns, they still make me nervous."

465
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:29,190
"Me too," said Somerset, putting his gun into
his jacket pocket.

466
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:33,591
"I hear you two were friends at high school,"
Somerset said.

467
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:41,179
"Yes," said Tracy "I knew then that this was
the man I was going to marry."

468
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:48,460
"So you're really an old married couple, if
you count up the years," said Somerset.

469
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:54,580
"Yeah, I guess so," she laughed.

470
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,919
Tracy put a dish of lasagna on the table,
and poured wine into their glasses.

471
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,099
"Why aren't you married?"

472
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:05,330
she asked as she sat down.

473
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,169
"I was married.

474
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:10,409
Twice."

475
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:14,609
Somerset looked thoughtful as he drank a little
wine.

476
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:18,529
"Somehow it didn't work, though."

477
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:22,369
"That surprises me," she said.

478
00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:23,649
He laughed.

479
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:29,960
"People soon find that I'm... not easy to
be with," he said.

480
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,399
"Just ask your husband."

481
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,080
Mills smiled.

482
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,980
"He's right about that."

483
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:46,220
Later, with the table cleared and Tracy asleep,
Mills and Somerset were studying the photos

484
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,340
of Gould's office.

485
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:53,309
"I think I'm missing something," Somerset
said.

486
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:57,869
"How do you think Gould was murdered?"

487
00:30:57,869 --> 00:31:04,970
"Well, the way I see it, the killer got into
the office before the building was closed

488
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:10,249
on Friday Gould's body was found on Tuesday
morning.

489
00:31:10,249 --> 00:31:16,839
The building was closed all day on Monday,
which means that the killer was probably with

490
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:24,229
Gould all day Saturday, all Sunday, and even
Monday."

491
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:29,609
Mills picked up a photo of Gould's body in
the high-backed leather chair.

492
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:34,950
"Gould was undressed and tied up," he went
on.

493
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,739
"But one arm was left free.

494
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:45,629
Now, the weighing machine on the desk that
didn't belong to Gould.

495
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:48,139
The killer brought it in.

496
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:56,330
He gave Gould a sharp knife and made him cut
out a piece of his body and weigh it.

497
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:02,139
There was this note," he picked up a photo
and gave it to Somerset.

498
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:05,980
"Look at this."

499
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:15,480
Somerset read the note: One pound of meat,
no more, no less...

500
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,690
His face was hard.

501
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:22,419
"Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

502
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:25,029
He wanted Gould to take his time.

503
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:28,389
To sit there and think about it.

504
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:31,999
What do you do when there's a gun in your
face?"

505
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:33,830
"Right!"

506
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,099
Mills picked up another photo.

507
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:40,830
It showed the picture of Mrs. Gould with the
eyes ringed with blood.

508
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,960
"This is a photo of Mrs. Gould," he said.

509
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:52,029
"If the killer's telling us she saw something,
I don't know what it could be.

510
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:53,629
She was out of town when it happened."

511
00:32:53,629 --> 00:33:02,739
"What if it's not something she's seen, but
something she could see, but she hasn't had

512
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:04,779
the chance yet?"

513
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:10,379
"Yeah, but what is it she's supposed to see?"

514
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:11,830
Somerset shook his head.

515
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:16,349
"Only one way to find out," he said.

516
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:17,349
***

517
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:20,980
Mrs. Gould was in a "safe house", guarded
by the police.

518
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:26,970
When Mills and Somerset walked in, Mills thought
that it looked like a place where someone

519
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,619
might go to kill himself.

520
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:34,419
Mrs. Gould was sitting on the bed, crying.

521
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:40,009
"I'm sorry to come here so late, Mrs. Gould,"
Mills said.

522
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:41,009
"But..."

523
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:43,590
"It's all right.

524
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,509
I haven't slept since..."

525
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:54,139
She began to cry again, holding her hand over
her mouth as if to stop herself.

526
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:56,179
Mills took out the photographs.

527
00:33:56,179 --> 00:33:59,009
"Mrs. Gould," he said.

528
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:05,799
"I need you to look at these again, and tell
me if there's anything that seems strange

529
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:08,080
or in the wrong place.

530
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,280
Anything at all"

531
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,050
But she wouldn't look.

532
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:17,680
"I've looked at them a million times," she
said.

533
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,780
"I don't want to see them again... ever."

534
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:29,050
Mills hated to see women cry, but he knew
he had to do this.

535
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,390
"Please, Mrs. Gould.

536
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,650
Anything at all.

537
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,800
Take your time.

538
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,850
Please..."

539
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,800
"There's nothing there," she said.

540
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,929
She wouldn't look at the photos again.

541
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:51,510
"There's something there that we're not seeing,"
said Mills.

542
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,290
"You're the only one who can help us now.

543
00:34:55,290 --> 00:35:00,150
We need your help if we're going to get the
person who did this."

544
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:05,050
"All right," she said.

545
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:12,840
She took the photos and started to look at
them, but too quickly, Mills thought.

546
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,130
She stopped at one picture and looked again.

547
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:20,760
"What do you see?" asked Mills.

548
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,250
"The painting," she said.

549
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:31,120
The photo showed the desk with the big, modern
oil painting on the wall behind it.

550
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,160
"What about the painting?"

551
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,430
Mills asked.

552
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:40,250
She looked up at him as if he had done something
wrong.

553
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,520
"Why is it upside down?"

554
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,230
she asked.

555
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,750
Somerset took the photo from the woman's hand,
and looked at it.

556
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,390
"Upside down?" he said.

557
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,390
***

558
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,680
Mills and Somerset went straight to Gould's
office.

559
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,730
Somerset looked up at the painting.

560
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,850
"You sure our people didn't move it?"

561
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:12,950
"Even if they did, the photos were taken first."

562
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:18,250
Somerset took the painting off the wall, Mills
thought there would be another message behind

563
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,370
it, written in blood.

564
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,130
But there was nothing.

565
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:29,200
"I don't want to think about the sleep I'm
missing because of this," he said.

566
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,760
"There's nothing here.

567
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,210
He's playing with us."

568
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,250
Somerset thought that Mills was probably right.

569
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:43,280
"But there must be something here," he said.

570
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,120
He was staring at the wall where the picture
had been.

571
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,680
"What is it?"

572
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,310
Mills asked.

573
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,880
"Quiet.

574
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm thinking."

575
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,710
This made Mills angry.

576
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:02,400
Did Somerset think that he was really a fool?

577
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,670
Somerset took out a brush and a small box.

578
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:12,330
Standing on a chair, he began to brush the
wall with fingerprint dust.

579
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,370
"Do you know how to do that?"

580
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:21,080
Mills was doubtful, but Somerset kept on working.

581
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:27,040
Mills tried to be patient, but he wanted to
see what Somerset had found.

582
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,410
"What is it?

583
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,380
What do you see?

584
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,980
Nothing.

585
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,580
Right?"

586
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,190
"Wait.

587
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:41,580
Just wait," said Somerset, still working.

588
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:48,670
Finally he moved away and Mills got a good
look at what he had found.

589
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:55,830
Written in fingerprints, as clear as ink,
was: HELP ME.

590
00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:00,840
Mills couldn't believe what he saw.

591
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,960
He looked at Somerset in surprise.

592
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,060
This guy really is good!

593
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,130
He thought.

594
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:15,560
CHAPTER THREE
Sloth

595
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:22,150
Somerset needed to know if the fingerprints
he had found matched those of a known criminal.

596
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:26,910
He and Mills watched the computer operator
as he began to search.

597
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:32,640
"I've known this to take as long as three
days," the operator said.

598
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,420
"So why don't you wait outside?"

599
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,870
Outside the computer room was an old sofa.

600
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,230
Somerset sat down and looked at his watch.

601
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,230
It was 1:20 a.m.

602
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:55,080
Mills got a can of Coke from a machine and
sat next to Somerset.

603
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:01,020
"You think our guy is crazy and asking for
help?

604
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,200
Is that his problem?"

605
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,760
Mills asked.

606
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,330
"No, I don't think so.

607
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:10,080
It doesn't fit.

608
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,160
I don't think he wants us to stop him.

609
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,970
Not until he's finished."

610
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,310
"I don't know.

611
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:22,030
There are plenty of people doing things they
don't want to do because they have voices

612
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:27,200
in their heads telling them to do bad things."

613
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,850
Somerset shook his head.

614
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,570
"Not this guy.

615
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:37,360
He may be hearing voices, but these murders
were well planned.

616
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:43,060
He's not going to stop until he's finished
what he wants to do."

617
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,920
Mills said nothing.

618
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,750
He drank some Coke, looking at Somerset.

619
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,950
"Something wrong?"

620
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,330
Somerset asked.

621
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:59,910
"Why is it that nobody believes you're going
to retire?"

622
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:05,740
Somerset didn't know how to answer this because
sometimes he didn't believe it himself.

623
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:12,230
Instead, he said, "You meant what you said
to Mrs. Gould tonight about catching this

624
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,770
guy, didn't you?

625
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,650
"Of course."

626
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:19,070
"I could never say that to her.

627
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,710
I've seen too many killers plead madness.

628
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:27,740
The ones that can pay get a lawyer like Gould
to defend them.

629
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,430
And a lot just disappear.

630
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:36,830
They kill for a few weeks or months, and then
we never hear from them again.

631
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:40,830
I can't think the way you do.

632
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,310
That's why I'm going."

633
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:49,160
"If you think that, then what are we doing?

634
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,340
Tell me."

635
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:56,370
"We just get all the facts, all the evidence.

636
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:02,120
We write it down and hope that some day it
will be used."

637
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,920
Somerset knew that whatever he did, it rarely
ended the way he wanted.

638
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:14,660
In the end, twelve ordinary people decided
whether a criminal was guilty or not guilty.

639
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,660
***

640
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,690
"Wake up, sleepyheads!

641
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,750
You have a winner!"

642
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,080
It was the captain standing over them.

643
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,210
Mills and Somerset had fallen asleep on the
sofa.

644
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,090
Mills looked at his watch.

645
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,450
It was 6:25 a.m.

646
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,220
Never enough sleep, he thought.

647
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,700
"Here's your man."

648
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,540
The captain showed a photo to Mills and Somerset.

649
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:51,230
It showed the thin face of a young man with
long, stringy hair and lots of rings in his

650
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,060
ears.

651
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,500
Victor Dworkin was his name, age twenty-five.

652
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,690
"We know Dworkin.

653
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:05,000
He's been in prison for robbery and sex crimes.

654
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,730
The last time he was in trouble with the police,
his lawyer helped him go free.

655
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,150
That lawyer was Eli Gould.

656
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,940
Mr. Greed."

657
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,640
Millss eyes lit up.

658
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,620
"That's our link!" he said.

659
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,120
"Wait.

660
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,020
Nobody has seen or heard from Dworkin for
months.

661
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:34,310
But we do have an address, and we're checking
it now."

662
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:39,520
A red-haired officer called California, and
four other policemen in uniform, came running

663
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
toward them.

664
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,000
The captain began giving them their orders.

665
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,340
"What do you think?"

666
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,970
Somerset asked Mills.

667
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,640
"Is Dworkin our killer?"

668
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,280
Mills thought for a moment.

669
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,240
"He doesn't seem like our man, does he?

670
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,600
I don't see our killer fitting that description."

671
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,920
Somerset nodded.

672
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,070
"No," he said.

673
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:11,370
"Our guy seems to have more purpose.

674
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:15,220
Dworkin looks like the type who has trouble
getting out of bed in the morning."

675
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:21,360
"Yeah, but what about the fingerprints?"

676
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,460
Somerset took a deep breath.

677
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:28,400
"Yes, they're his.

678
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,590
So I suppose it must be him."

679
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,590
***

680
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:39,620
Mills and Somerset were in their car, following
the black police van taking California and

681
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:44,120
the uniformed men to Dworkin's apartment.

682
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,270
Somerset took out his gun and checked.

683
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,370
Mills nodded at the gun.

684
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:53,960
"You ever get hit by one?"

685
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,800
"A bullet?

686
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,230
No.

687
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:03,970
Twenty-three years on the job, and I've only
taken out my gun three times.

688
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,170
Never fired it, though.

689
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,950
Not once."

690
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,590
He put his gun away.

691
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:13,170
"How about you?"

692
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,850
Mills shook his head.

693
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:18,060
"Never got hit.

694
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,660
Pulled my gun out once...

695
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,660
And fired it."

696
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,930
"Yeah?"

697
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,660
"Yeah...

698
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,210
It was my first time on something like this.

699
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,140
The guy had killed his wife.

700
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:37,020
I didn't think he was the kind who would shoot
at the police.

701
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:42,930
But when we broke through the door, he was
holding a gun on a cop outside the window.

702
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,320
He fired once.

703
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,930
I fired five times."

704
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:52,330
"How did it end?" asked Somerset.

705
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:54,850
Mills thought for a moment.

706
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:58,980
He changed the story a little because he felt
so guilty.

707
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,050
"I killed him.

708
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:06,140
The other cop was hit in the leg."

709
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:12,360
He wondered if he should tell Somerset what
really happened to Rick that night.

710
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,130
"So how did it feel?

711
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,180
Killing a man?"

712
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,550
"I thought that it would be bad.

713
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,470
You know...

714
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,520
But that night I slept well."

715
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,770
But that was only because he hadn't known
about Rick then.

716
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:38,210
Later, when he knew that Rick would never
walk again, he didn't sleep so well.

717
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,990
He still didn't.

718
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,890
Somerset was thoughtful for some time.

719
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:49,850
Then he said, "Well, I've been lucky so far.

720
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,560
I never killed anyone."

721
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,370
Mills just nodded.

722
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:00,300
Would today be like that night? he wondered.

723
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,760
Would Somerset get shot because Mills was
too slow?

724
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,990
No way, he thought.

725
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:11,559
He wasn't going to let that happen again.

726
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:12,559
***

727
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:14,180
The van stopped in front of them.

728
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,340
This was Dworkin's apartment block.

729
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:21,230
The uniformed police ran into the building.

730
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,890
Somerset and Mills followed them in.

731
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,780
Mills's mouth was dry.

732
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:31,500
It had been just like this when Rick was shot.

733
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,690
He pulled out his gun as they climbed the
stairs.

734
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:42,390
On the third floor, they stepped over a man
who was so drunk he couldn't move.

735
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,940
Then they got to Dworkin's apartment.

736
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:52,630
California waved everyone back to make room
for the two men breaking down the door.

737
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:54,360
"Move!"

738
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,710
California shouted as the door broke open.

739
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:04,180
"Police!" he shouted as he pushed through
the broken door, holding his gun.

740
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,980
"Police officers!"

741
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:15,720
When Mills finally got inside, he saw that
the apartment was small, dirty, and very dusty.

742
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,320
The uniformed cops were everywhere.

743
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,460
"In here!"

744
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,020
California shouted.

745
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:27,430
Mills moved fast to get into the bedroom first.

746
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:33,340
There was a body under a dirty sheet lying
on a small bed.

747
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:38,900
California moved slowly toward it, his gun
in both hands.

748
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:42,380
Mills had both hands on his gun too.

749
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:47,990
All he could think of was that Dworkin might
have a gun under the sheet.

750
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:52,870
He might shoot California just as Rick had
been shot.

751
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,550
"Good morning!"

752
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:58,120
California shouted.

753
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,070
The body didn't move.

754
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:02,380
"Get up!"

755
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,040
California shouted again.

756
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,430
"I said get up!

757
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,270
Now!"

758
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,270
***

759
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:12,590
Somerset looked in from the door.

760
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:21,270
There was a terrible smell inside, SLOTH was
written on the wall above the bed.

761
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,900
California lifted the sheet.

762
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:29,390
Then everyone could see that Dworkin wasn't
going to shoot.

763
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:32,050
The body was tied to the bed.

764
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:37,290
It was so thin that there seemed to be nothing
but skin and bones.

765
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:43,410
A bandage was tied over his eyes.

766
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,480
Somerset took out a photo of Dworkin.

767
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,590
"Is it him?"

768
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,560
Mills asked.

769
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,230
"Yeah.

770
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:54,200
It's him."

771
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,370
California pointed with his gun at the man's
right arm.

772
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:02,930
The hand had been cut off at the wrist.

773
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,690
Mills kept shaking his head.

774
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,920
He couldn't believe what he saw.

775
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,300
"Oh, no, no," he was saying.

776
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:19,450
One of the policemen showed Somerset some
photos pinned to the wall.

777
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:23,050
They showed Dworkin tied to the bed.

778
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:29,970
Each one had the date written under it, and
in each one the body was thinner.

779
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:36,330
"There are fifty-two of them," the policeman
said.

780
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,540
"I counted."

781
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:42,030
Somerset pointed to the date on the first
photo.

782
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:46,450
"Exactly one year ago today," he said.

783
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:51,500
"What kind of man is this killer?"

784
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,050
Suddenly a loud noise came from the body.

785
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:58,630
California jumped back and fell over a chair.

786
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:02,550
"He's alive!" he shouted.

787
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:06,700
Dworkin's mouth was open and his lips moved
a little.

788
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,210
A strange sound came from his throat.

789
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:14,680
"He's alive!" said California again.

790
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,590
"Get an ambulance.

791
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:19,900
Now!"

792
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,590
Somerset and Mills were back in the office
that afternoon.

793
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:29,300
Somerset looked as if he had the weight of
the world on his shoulders.

794
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,950
It annoyed Mills.

795
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:34,860
Somerset wasn't he only cop on this investigation.

796
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:38,350
"I want to catch him too."

797
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:39,350
Mills said.

798
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,540
"You know that.

799
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,730
I want to hurt him."

800
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,540
Somerset picked up some papers.

801
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,260
"Did you read this?" he asked.

802
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:54,430
"The money tor Dworkin's apartment was paid
regularly.

803
00:50:54,430 --> 00:51:00,420
The killer planned and worked hard to keep
Dworkin alive so long.

804
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:04,280
Exactly a year to the day.

805
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,500
And he paid for his apartment.

806
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,550
He knows what he wants to do.

807
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:14,620
And he's patient."

808
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:23,440
Somerset remembered the note he had found:
Long is the way and hard...

809
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,740
And the seven deadly sins...?

810
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,670
Somerset liked to read books.

811
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,340
Perhaps the killer did too.

812
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,050
That gave him an idea.

813
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:41,370
He took Mills with him to the public library.

814
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:44,680
Somerset seemed to have friends everywhere.

815
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:51,010
In a short time, he had a computer list of
people who had borrowed books on subjects

816
00:51:51,010 --> 00:52:01,130
like crime, sin, the church, homicide, anything
that would interest the killer.

817
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:06,300
They sat in Somerset's car and checked the
list.

818
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,260
Mills thought they were wasting their time.

819
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:14,790
"You got a better idea?" asked Somerset.

820
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:20,830
"Maybe this is one we should check," said
Mills, suddenly sitting up.

821
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:27,130
"This guy's had..." he counted, "...over thirty
of these titles."

822
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,670
"What's the name?"

823
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:35,330
"You won't believe it," said Mills.

824
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,680
"John Doe."

825
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,190
Somerset started the engine.

826
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:47,700
"What address?" he said, as the car pulled
into the street.

827
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:56,870
CHAPTER FOUR
John Doe

828
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:02,530
John Doe's apartment was on a narrow street
in a poor part of the city.

829
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:06,280
They took the elevator to the sixth floor.

830
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:12,440
Doe's apartment was in the front of the building,
but Somerset thought that even if he had seen

831
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:18,350
them coming, Doe wouldn't know who they were.

832
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:21,450
Mills knocked hard on the door.

833
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:26,830
Somerset heard a noise, but it didn't come
from inside the apartment.

834
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:32,770
He turned and saw a dark shape in the shadow
of a door.

835
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,670
Then he saw the gun.

836
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,150
"Mills!" he shouted.

837
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:42,240
They both hit the floor at the same time.

838
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,560
The noise hurt Somerset's ears.

839
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:50,840
Big holes appeared in the door of Doe's apartment.

840
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,560
'Hollow bullets' thought Somerset.

841
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,940
He imagined Mills getting shot.

842
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,920
He would have to tell Tracy.

843
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:06,030
But Mills had pulled his gun and run after
Doe before Somerset could even think of stopping

844
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,110
him.

845
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,160
Be careful, he thought.

846
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,400
He was worried for Tracy.

847
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,370
Somerset followed Mills down the stairs.

848
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:23,970
Doe was standing on the floor below, his gun
in his hand.

849
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:28,670
Mills jumped back just as Doe fired.

850
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:32,660
The bullet hit the wall close to Somerset.

851
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:36,010
Mills waited for another shot.

852
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,340
Instead he heard a door close.

853
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:46,300
As fast as he could, he ran through the door
and saw Doe running.

854
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:51,530
Doe pushed a woman away and ran into her apartment.

855
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:53,480
"Police!"

856
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,790
Mills shouted as he followed Doe into the
apartment.

857
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:01,740
He saw Doe climbing through a window onto
the fire escape.

858
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:09,380
Mills ran to the window Doe fired again, breaking
the glass.

859
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:16,690
When Mills looked again, he couldn't see Doe,
but he could hear him running.

860
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:22,150
Out on the fire escape, Mills ran and jumped
to the ground.

861
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:26,440
When he reached the street, he wanted to scream.

862
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,320
There were people everywhere.

863
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:33,230
In this crowd, he would never see Doe.

864
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:38,960
Then, suddenly, impossibly, he saw him.

865
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,680
Doe wras waiting to cross the street, looking
for a break in the traffic.

866
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,580
Mills ran straight into the street.

867
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:53,370
Cars and trucks rushed past him, the drivers
shouting at him.

868
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:56,700
Doe could see that Mills was following him.

869
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:02,950
He ran through the traffic and disappeared
into a narrow, dark street.

870
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:07,400
Mills was close behind him, running fast.

871
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,960
Suddenly something hit Mills in the face.

872
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:18,330
He dropped his gun - he heard it hit the ground
- then he fell.

873
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:20,840
The pain made him weak.

874
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:27,600
A board, he thought, a piece of wood.

875
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,880
He didn't see it coming, but that was all
he could imagine.

876
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,240
Doe had hit him with a board.

877
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,000
He was sure that his nose was broken.

878
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,390
He was coughing blood.

879
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:50,830
Trying to open his eyes, he saw a pair of
legs and a hand picking up his gun.

880
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:57,230
He tried to reach it and get it back, but
the pain was too bad.

881
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:01,930
Then he could feel his own gun pressed against
his face.

882
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:05,390
His mouth was full of blood.

883
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:07,950
He couldn't see.

884
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:11,990
He was helpless.

885
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:15,920
After a moment, the gun was gone.

886
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,920
He was still alive.

887
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,320
Then he felt something hit his chest.

888
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:25,510
Then again, and again.

889
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,540
Bullets.

890
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,340
Doe was throwing the bullets at him.

891
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:34,030
Emptying his gun.

892
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:42,310
He heard Doe running again, and began feeling
for the gun and the bullets like a blind man.

893
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,480
"Mills!"

894
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,630
It was Somerset running toward him.

895
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:50,060
"You all right?"

896
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,310
Somerset knelt down next to Mills.

897
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:54,860
"I'll call an ambulance."

898
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,060
"No.

899
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,460
I'm fine."

900
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,480
Mills got to his feet.

901
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,140
"What happened?"

902
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,010
Somerset wanted to know.

903
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:08,760
But Mills was too angry to talk.

904
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:17,500
He wiped the blood from his eyes and ran past
Somerset as fast as the pain let him.

905
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,300
Somerset tried to keep up with Mills.

906
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,210
Tried to get him to tell what had happened.

907
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:26,510
But Mills was too angry.

908
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:30,350
He was going to do something stupid.

909
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:34,160
Somerset knew it.

910
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,160
***

911
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,060
The broken door of Doe's apartment opened
easily.

912
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:44,810
Inside everything was dark because the walls
were painted black.

913
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:46,950
So were the windows.

914
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:51,210
The living room had only a lamp and a chair
in it.

915
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:55,730
The next room they looked into was also painted
black.

916
00:58:55,730 --> 00:59:00,510
There was one small bed with a dirty sheet
on it.

917
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:05,580
In the middle of the room was a small desk
and a lamp.

918
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:13,600
Inside the desk were neat rows of empty medicine
bottles and boxes of bullets.

919
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:21,790
Mills saw that some of the bullets were the
hollow type that are called "cop killers."

920
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:25,130
In a corner of the room was a small table.

921
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:31,160
On it there was a careful arrangement of things
around a large glass jar.

922
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,260
In the jar was a human hand.

923
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:40,220
Victor Dworkin, thought Mills.

924
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,560
Oh, man...

925
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,890
Mills found the bathroom.

926
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:48,910
It had only a soft red light.

927
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:53,290
Doe had made it into a photographic darkroom.

928
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:56,780
Film hung all around.

929
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,360
Photos were pinned to the wall everywhere.

930
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:09,640
There were pictures of Peter Eubanks, still
alive; Eli Gould cutting into his own body;

931
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:16,310
Victor Dworkin, his face asking the camera
for pity.

932
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:20,990
There were also pictures of a blond woman
sitting on a bed.

933
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:26,920
She wasn't hurt, but she looked very uncomfortable.

934
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:33,590
Mills could see how much work and preparation
Doe put into his killing.

935
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:40,280
There were also photos of Somerset and Mills
at Dworkin's apartment.

936
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,510
Suddenly a phone rang.

937
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:45,690
Mills ran out of the bathroom.

938
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:47,430
Somerset was running the other way.

939
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:51,360
"Where is it?" he said.

940
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,440
Mills found the phone in the bedroom.

941
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,630
He picked it up.

942
01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:00,310
"Hello," he said.

943
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:02,000
Nothing.

944
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,810
Someone was there, but he wasn't saying anything.

945
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:10,800
Mills said "Hello?" again.

946
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:17,560
"I admire you," said a thin voice finally.

947
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:21,910
"I don't know how you found me.

948
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:26,610
I admire you detectives more every day."

949
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:30,720
"OK, John," said Mills.

950
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,320
"Tell me..."

951
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,720
"No, no, no!

952
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,490
You listen to me.

953
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:41,750
I'll have to change my plans now.

954
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:50,790
I just had to call to say how clever I think
you are, and to apologize for hurting one

955
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,590
of you."

956
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:58,090
Mills was really angry, but he didn't answer.

957
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:02,760
"I'd like to say more," Doe went on.

958
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,800
"But I don't want to spoil the surprise."

959
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,170
"What do you mean, John?"

960
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:14,830
"Until next time," said Doe.

961
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:15,860
"John!

962
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,880
Wait..."

963
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:21,640
But Doe was gone.

964
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:27,500
In another room Somerset discovered John Doe's
"library".

965
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,810
Three of the walls were covered with books.

966
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:37,920
The same kind of books that Doe had borrowed
from the public library.

967
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,500
Somerset wondered how Doe found time to read
them all.

968
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,300
One wall was covered with Doe's notebooks.

969
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,400
There were thousands of them.

970
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:57,690
Each one with about 250 pages, all filled
with Doe's own writing, and with photos and

971
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:02,690
pictures cut from magazines.

972
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:09,040
Mills thought that these notebooks were crazy,
but Somerset disagreed.

973
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:14,310
He thought that they were horrible but interesting.

974
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:20,751
Doe's writings frightened Somerset, but he
spent hours reading the notebooks, trying

975
01:03:20,751 --> 01:03:24,140
to understand Doe's thinking.

976
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:32,990
Doe didn't like all the horrible things that
people had to live with these days.

977
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:36,510
Somerset agreed with Doe about a lot of this.

978
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:40,980
That was why he wanted to retire and live
in the country.

979
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,340
But Doe wanted to change things.

980
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:50,060
The problem was that Doe was also horrible.

981
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:55,600
Murdering people couldn't make anything better.

982
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,460
Mills came into the room where Somerset was
reading.

983
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:04,760
"Does he say anything about the murders?"
he asked.

984
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:10,420
"No, I haven't found anything yet," said Somerset.

985
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:14,540
"Do you have anything new?"

986
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:19,450
Mills showed him a photo of a blonde woman
standing on a street corner.

987
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:27,960
"There are pictures of her in the bathroom,
with other pictures of Doe's victims."

988
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:38,030
Having your picture taken by Doe wasn't a
good sign, "Any idea who she is?" asked Somerset.

989
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:39,780
Mills shook his head.

990
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:44,000
"Whoever she is, she caught Doe's eye."

991
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,420
"Better check it with the office," said Somerset.

992
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,970
"Maybe they know who she is.

993
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:58,090
Perhaps we'll get lucky and find her while
she's still breathing."

994
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:00,350
Somerset looked at his watch.

995
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:01,680
It was past eleven.

996
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:07,010
"Better go home now and get some sleep," he
said.

997
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:09,511
CHAPTER FIVE
Lust

998
01:05:09,511 --> 01:05:17,770
An hour later, Somerset was lying in bed when
the phone rang.

999
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:20,350
It was Tracy.

1000
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,420
He looked at the clock.

1001
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:25,369
It was after midnight.

1002
01:05:25,369 --> 01:05:29,990
"Tracy, is everything all right?" he asked.

1003
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:32,249
"Yes, yes.

1004
01:05:32,249 --> 01:05:33,330
Everything's fine.

1005
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:37,150
I'm sorry to call you so late.

1006
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:38,700
I just...

1007
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:42,619
I need to talk to someone.

1008
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:45,020
Can you meet me somewhere?

1009
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,460
Maybe tomorrow morning?"

1010
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:52,350
"I don't understand, Tracy," said Somerset.

1011
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:55,300
"You sound worried."

1012
01:05:55,300 --> 01:06:01,950
"I feel really stupid, but you're the only
person I know here."

1013
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:06,830
"I'll help you if I can, Tracy," he said.

1014
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:10,100
He couldn't imagine what he could do for her.

1015
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:15,480
"If you can meet me tomorrow, call me.

1016
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,580
Please.

1017
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:19,470
I have to go now.

1018
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:21,600
Good night."

1019
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,570
She hung up.

1020
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:31,990
The next morning Somerset met Tracy in the
Parthenon Coffee Shop near the precinct house.

1021
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:37,270
"So what's on your mind, Tracy?" he asked.

1022
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:40,790
"You know this city," she began.

1023
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:44,150
"You've been here a long time.

1024
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:46,750
I haven't."

1025
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:47,869
Somerset nodded.

1026
01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:52,040
"It can be a hard place," he said.

1027
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:56,180
"I haven't been sleeping well since we came
here.

1028
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,050
I don't feel safe.

1029
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:02,150
Even at home."

1030
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:04,850
He didn't know what to tell her.

1031
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:08,070
Maybe she should talk more with her husband.

1032
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:12,510
"Talk to him about it," he said.

1033
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:14,280
"He'll understand."

1034
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:19,260
"I don't know why I asked you to come," she
said.

1035
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:21,100
Her hands were shaking.

1036
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:26,270
"You know that I'm a teacher," she went on.

1037
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:31,700
"I've been trying to get work in some of the
schools here.

1038
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:36,990
But the schools are... horrible."

1039
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:39,390
She was starting to cry.

1040
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:45,180
"What's really worrying you, Tracy?" he said.

1041
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,180
"I...

1042
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:47,580
I'm going to have a baby."

1043
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:48,580
"Tracy," said Somerset.

1044
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:49,580
"I'm not the one to talk to about this."

1045
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:50,580
"I hate this city," she said.

1046
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:51,580
"If you're thinking...," he let out a long
breath.

1047
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:52,580
"... about whether to have the baby..."

1048
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:53,580
"But I want to have children," she said.

1049
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:54,580
"All I can tell you, Tracy," he said, "is
that if you don't keep the baby, if that's

1050
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:55,580
what you decide, never tell David.

1051
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,580
But if you're going to have it, tell him now.

1052
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,580
That's all the advice I can give you."

1053
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:58,580
Tracy took his hand as he got up from the
table.

1054
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,580
"Promise you'll keep in touch after you retire.

1055
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:00,580
Please."

1056
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:01,580
"Sure.

1057
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,580
I promise," he said, and waved good-bye from
the door.

1058
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,580
As Somerset reached the precinct house, Mills
met him at the door.

1059
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,580
"We've got another one," he said.

1060
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,580
Somerset felt tired and empty.

1061
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:06,580
But he wasn't surprised.

1062
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:07,580
He knew it was going to happen again.

1063
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:08,580
***

1064
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,580
The outside of the Hot House Massage Parlor
was painted bright red.

1065
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:10,580
Police cars were parked everywhere out front.

1066
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:11,580
Uniformed cops were trying to control the
crowd of confused people, but they weren't

1067
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:12,580
having an easy time.

1068
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,580
Mills pushed through the crowd with Somerset
just behind him.

1069
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:14,580
A cop was trying to talk to the doorman.

1070
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:15,580
"Did you hear any screams?"

1071
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:16,580
he asked.

1072
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,580
"Did you see anything that seemed strange?"

1073
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:18,580
"No," said the man.

1074
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:19,580
He was a big, fat man, who looked like an
ugly animal.

1075
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:20,580
"Everybody who comes in here looks strange.

1076
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:21,580
And they're screaming all the time in there.

1077
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:22,580
That comes with a place like this."

1078
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:23,580
"You like working in this place, man?"

1079
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:24,580
the cop asked.

1080
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:25,580
"You like the things you see?"

1081
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:26,580
There was an ugly smile on the man's face.

1082
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:27,580
"No, I don't," he said.

1083
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:28,580
"But that's life.

1084
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:29,580
Right?"

1085
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:30,580
Mills and Somerset pushed past the crowd of
people.

1086
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,580
Inside, the walls were painted red, and the
red lights made it more red.

1087
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:32,580
The red light and the beat of the heavy-metal
rock music reminded Mills of a scene from

1088
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:33,580
hell.

1089
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:34,580
"Detectives?"

1090
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:35,580
A confused cop led them to a room with a strong
light that went on and off quickly.

1091
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:36,580
"They're in there," said the cop, stopping
at the door.

1092
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,580
"But I don't want to go in there again.

1093
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,690
I'll wait right here."

1094
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:43,479
Mills stepped carefully into the room.

1095
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:46,579
He was confused by the light.

1096
01:08:46,579 --> 01:08:50,349
The music was just as loud in there.

1097
01:08:50,349 --> 01:08:55,619
Two medical workers were trying to calm a
man with no clothes on.

1098
01:08:55,619 --> 01:09:00,739
He was about fifty-five years old, with dark
gray hair.

1099
01:09:00,739 --> 01:09:05,639
His hands were tied behind his back.

1100
01:09:05,639 --> 01:09:11,940
On a large bed in the middle of the room was
a body covered with a sheet.

1101
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:15,229
There was a lot of blood on the sheet.

1102
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:20,769
Some of the victim's blond hair hung over
the edge of the bed.

1103
01:09:20,769 --> 01:09:26,420
It made Mills think of Tracy, and that made
him angry.

1104
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:31,639
Why did anything in this hell make him think
of his wife?

1105
01:09:31,639 --> 01:09:35,269
"He made me do it!"

1106
01:09:35,269 --> 01:09:38,900
the gray-haired man shouted, fighting with
the medical workers.

1107
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:42,380
"He had a gun!"

1108
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:48,440
The word LUST was written on the wall over
the bed.

1109
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:55,880
Mills was so angry when he saw it that his
hands were shaking.

1110
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,840
Somerset was looking at the body.

1111
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:03,980
"You won't want to see that more than once,"
warned the medical worker.

1112
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,289
"He had a gun!"

1113
01:10:07,289 --> 01:10:08,289
shouted the suspect again.

1114
01:10:08,289 --> 01:10:12,139
"He made me do it!"

1115
01:10:12,139 --> 01:10:15,440
Mills was looking over Somerset's shoulder.

1116
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:20,190
What they saw made them feel sick.

1117
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:27,550
There were no marks on the top part of the
body - but lower down...

1118
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:34,389
"He asked me if I was married," said the suspect.

1119
01:10:34,389 --> 01:10:35,909
He was quieter now.

1120
01:10:35,909 --> 01:10:40,780
"He had a gun in his hand..."

1121
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,260
"Where was the girl?"

1122
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,320
Somerset asked.

1123
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,360
"The girl?

1124
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,670
W-w-what do you mean?"

1125
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:51,789
"Was she on the street?"

1126
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,300
"S-s-she was on the bed.

1127
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,659
S-s-sitting on the bed."

1128
01:10:57,659 --> 01:11:00,570
"Who tied her down?"

1129
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:01,960
Somerset asked.

1130
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,540
"You or him?"

1131
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:10,489
"He had a gun, a gun..."

1132
01:11:10,489 --> 01:11:12,199
The man was starting to cry.

1133
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:15,620
"He had the gun in my mouth!"

1134
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:24,829
Mills remembered the taste of the gun in his
own mouth after Doe had hit him in the face.

1135
01:11:24,829 --> 01:11:27,440
His stomach was turning over.

1136
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:33,579
He took out his notebook and turned to the
page where he had written the-seven deadly

1137
01:11:33,579 --> 01:11:36,929
sins.

1138
01:11:36,929 --> 01:11:42,380
Another one down, he thought, his hands shaking.

1139
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:44,469
Three more to come.

1140
01:11:44,469 --> 01:11:51,650
Envy, wrath and pride.

1141
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:54,380
He looked at the blood on the sheet.

1142
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:58,070
What next? he thought.

1143
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:02,159
Holy God, what next?

1144
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:06,260
CHAPTER SIX
Pride

1145
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,530
The phone woke Mills.

1146
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:11,099
He sat up suddenly.

1147
01:12:11,099 --> 01:12:13,840
Tracy's nails were digging into his arm.

1148
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,949
"David!

1149
01:12:14,949 --> 01:12:18,300
What is it?"

1150
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,519
Mills picked up the phone quickly.

1151
01:12:20,519 --> 01:12:21,679
"Hello?"

1152
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:26,300
"I've done it again."

1153
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,469
Mills's blood turned to ice.

1154
01:12:29,469 --> 01:12:31,500
He knew that voice.

1155
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,699
It was John Doe.

1156
01:12:33,699 --> 01:12:35,940
How did he get Mills's number?

1157
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:36,940
"Doe!

1158
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,679
Are you there?

1159
01:12:38,679 --> 01:12:41,350
Talk to me!"

1160
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:43,539
But it wasn't Doe.

1161
01:12:43,539 --> 01:12:46,829
It was Somerset.

1162
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:47,829
Mills was angry.

1163
01:12:47,829 --> 01:12:51,110
"What's wrong with you, Somerset?"

1164
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:52,920
he shouted.

1165
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,429
He looked at the clock by the bed.

1166
01:12:55,429 --> 01:12:58,580
It was 4:38 in the morning.

1167
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:05,010
"I just got a call from the officer guarding
Doe's apartment," said Somerset.

1168
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:10,460
"Doe called there and left the message you
just heard."

1169
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:14,639
"Is that all he said?"

1170
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:15,639
"Yes.

1171
01:13:15,639 --> 01:13:20,260
We also found another body.

1172
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:22,670
Pride."

1173
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,800
Tracy looked worried.

1174
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,679
"David," she said.

1175
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:30,519
"What's happening?"

1176
01:13:30,519 --> 01:13:32,599
Mills's head was hurting.

1177
01:13:32,599 --> 01:13:39,559
"I wish I knew," he said.

1178
01:13:39,559 --> 01:13:40,559
***

1179
01:13:40,559 --> 01:13:44,619
When Mills arrived at the new crime scene,
the police department workers were already

1180
01:13:44,619 --> 01:13:47,019
busy.

1181
01:13:47,019 --> 01:13:51,420
Somerset and the Medical Examiner were in
the bedroom.

1182
01:13:51,420 --> 01:14:00,110
The first thing Mills saw were the words on
the wall over the bed: PRIDE - then underneath

1183
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:05,429
- I DID NOT KILL HER.

1184
01:14:05,429 --> 01:14:11,090
SHE WAS ABLE TO CHOOSE.

1185
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:12,909
Sitting up in bed was the body.

1186
01:14:12,909 --> 01:14:16,500
Her face was bandaged.

1187
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,150
There was blood on the bandage.

1188
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:23,940
In one hand she held a small bottle.

1189
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:28,710
Two red pills had fallen out onto the bed.

1190
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:32,840
The bed was crowded with soft, woolly animals.

1191
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:39,949
The doctor started to cut through the bandages
around her head.

1192
01:14:39,949 --> 01:14:44,849
Mills was afraid of what he was going to see.

1193
01:14:44,849 --> 01:14:47,610
Somerset had found a photo of the victim.

1194
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:50,110
He showed it to Mills.

1195
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:54,719
Her name was Linda Abernathy.

1196
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:57,909
She was beautiful.

1197
01:14:57,909 --> 01:15:00,579
The doctor took off the bandage.

1198
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:04,429
Her nose was gone.

1199
01:15:04,429 --> 01:15:06,969
Mills had to look away.

1200
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,480
His stomach was turning over.

1201
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,000
He had to leave the room.

1202
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:21,499
"The killer cut off her nose," said Somerset,
"and gave her the bottle of pills.

1203
01:15:21,499 --> 01:15:30,079
She could choose to live without a nose or
kill herself."

1204
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:31,079
***

1205
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:36,949
Mills and Somerset drove back to the precinct
house through the slow-moving traffic.

1206
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:44,150
As they got out of the car, a man got out
of a taxi and followed them into the building.

1207
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:47,880
"Excuse me.

1208
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,750
Detective?"

1209
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:52,659
Mills kept on walking.

1210
01:15:52,659 --> 01:15:54,929
"Detective?"

1211
01:15:54,929 --> 01:15:59,909
Mills turned around, and almost fell over
with surprise.

1212
01:15:59,909 --> 01:16:00,909
It was John Doe.

1213
01:16:00,909 --> 01:16:06,760
Doe smiled and held up his hands.

1214
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:11,520
His shirt and pants were wet with blood.

1215
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,369
Mills couldn't believe this was happening.

1216
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:16,960
"It's him!"

1217
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,630
California suddenly shouted.

1218
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:23,289
He pulled his gun and ran up to Doe.

1219
01:16:23,289 --> 01:16:28,269
Pushing his gun against Doe's ear, he shouted,
"On the ground!

1220
01:16:28,269 --> 01:16:29,710
Now!

1221
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,150
Move!"

1222
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:39,079
By this time, Mills and several other cops
had their guns pointed at Doe.

1223
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:41,389
Somerset ran back down the stairs.

1224
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:45,880
"Be careful!" he shouted.

1225
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:54,989
Doe was lying on his face, doing what he was
told, but Mills wasn't going to take a chance.

1226
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:59,729
He stood over Doe with his gun pressed against
Doe's neck.

1227
01:16:59,729 --> 01:17:04,920
"Hands behind your head!" he ordered.

1228
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,110
"Don't move!"

1229
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:13,440
Doe turned his head and smiled at Somerset.

1230
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,940
"Hello," he said.

1231
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:23,010
California shouted "Shut up!" and pushed Doe's
head to the floor.

1232
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:26,229
"What is it?"

1233
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:28,150
whispered Mills to Somerset.

1234
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:32,280
"I don't under-stand this."

1235
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,380
Somerset could only shake his head.

1236
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:38,010
Doe looked at Mills again.

1237
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:43,550
"I want to speak to my lawyer" he said.

1238
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:50,510
CHAPTER SEVEN
Envy and Wrath

1239
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:55,440
Somerset watched through the glass as Doe
talked to his lawyer.

1240
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,860
Doe was calm and smiling.

1241
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:02,090
He looked like any ordinary man.

1242
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:06,110
He didn't look like a killer.

1243
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:11,100
Doe's lawyer was asking questions and taking
notes.

1244
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:16,969
Somerset couldn't hear what they were saying
because the rules of American law won't let

1245
01:18:16,969 --> 01:18:22,739
anybody hear what a criminal says to his lawyer.

1246
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:27,239
Mills and the captain watched over Somerset's
shoulder.

1247
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:31,969
"When can we question him, Captain?" asked
Mills.

1248
01:18:31,969 --> 01:18:33,999
"You can't.

1249
01:18:33,999 --> 01:18:40,590
Because he's saying he did it, it goes straight
to the public lawyer's office."

1250
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,540
Mills shook his head.

1251
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:45,960
"He wouldn't just say he did it.

1252
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,010
It doesn't make sense.

1253
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:51,619
He doesn't feel sorry.

1254
01:18:51,619 --> 01:18:53,050
Look at him."

1255
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:58,519
"He's not finished yet," said Somerset.

1256
01:18:58,519 --> 01:18:59,780
The captain laughed.

1257
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:03,239
"What can he do in prison?"

1258
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,789
"I don't know.

1259
01:19:05,789 --> 01:19:09,230
But I do know he's not finished yet.

1260
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:10,360
He can't be.

1261
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:15,139
He's still got Envy and Wrath to go before
he's finished."

1262
01:19:15,139 --> 01:19:18,910
"Maybe he's already finished.

1263
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:21,980
We just haven't found the bodies yet."

1264
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:26,119
"I don't think so," said Somerset.

1265
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:29,280
"He likes sending messages.

1266
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:34,969
Why would he keep quiet about the last two?"

1267
01:19:34,969 --> 01:19:41,239
That afternoon, Mills and Somerset were called
to the captain's office.

1268
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:45,510
Doe's lawyer, Mark Swarr, was there.

1269
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:47,420
The captain nodded to Swarr.

1270
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:50,789
"Tell them," he said.

1271
01:19:50,789 --> 01:19:54,350
Swarr turned to the two detectives.

1272
01:19:54,350 --> 01:20:03,059
"My client has told me that there are two
more bodies - two more victims, hidden.

1273
01:20:03,059 --> 01:20:11,630
He says he will only tell where they are to
Detectives Mills and Somerset, and only at

1274
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:14,150
six o'clock today."

1275
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:17,019
"Why us?"

1276
01:20:17,019 --> 01:20:18,070
Mills asked.

1277
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:22,150
"He says he admires you."

1278
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:27,469
"This is all part of his game," said Somerset.

1279
01:20:27,469 --> 01:20:36,130
"My client also says that if you don't take
his offer, he will plead madness and the bodies

1280
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:39,070
will never be found.

1281
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:45,969
If you do take his offer, he'll plead guilty
to all the murders right now."

1282
01:20:45,969 --> 01:20:54,610
"If your client pleads madness," said Somerset,
"what you're saying would show that he isn't

1283
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:55,710
mad."

1284
01:20:55,710 --> 01:21:03,500
"Perhaps," said Swarr, "but think of what
the papers would say if the police didn't

1285
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:07,150
try to find the bodies of two of his victims."

1286
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:12,769
"If there really are two more bodies," said
Somerset.

1287
01:21:12,769 --> 01:21:18,679
He knew that it was wrong to do what Doe wanted.

1288
01:21:18,679 --> 01:21:24,219
But he couldn't see any other possibility.

1289
01:21:24,219 --> 01:21:25,219
***

1290
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:29,909
Mills and Somerset sat in a police car on
the precinct parking lot.

1291
01:21:29,909 --> 01:21:34,050
John Doe was in the car with them.

1292
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:41,929
A mile away, California and two cops with
guns waited in a helicopter.

1293
01:21:41,929 --> 01:21:50,019
As the helicopter lifted into the air, a uniformed
cop gave Somerset the sign to move.

1294
01:21:50,019 --> 01:21:53,830
Somerset and Mills had microphones on them.

1295
01:21:53,830 --> 01:22:00,730
California would be in the helicopter, listening
to everything that was said.

1296
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:07,000
If anything went wrong, he would be right
there.

1297
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:13,699
Somerset drove through the city streets until
they left the buildings behind.

1298
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:19,119
Twenty minutes later, they were on the freeway,
driving through the desert.

1299
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:20,119
***

1300
01:22:20,119 --> 01:22:23,729
"Stop here," Doe said.

1301
01:22:23,729 --> 01:22:28,300
"This will be fine."

1302
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,369
Somerset slowed down.

1303
01:22:30,369 --> 01:22:33,760
There was nothing but desert.

1304
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:38,550
Further along the road was a long, low building.

1305
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:42,380
That was all they could see.

1306
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:44,749
Somerset stopped the car.

1307
01:22:44,749 --> 01:22:47,600
Doe looked at Mills.

1308
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,749
"Can we get out now, Detective?"

1309
01:22:51,749 --> 01:22:53,210
he said.

1310
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:57,570
Mills and Somerset looked at each other.

1311
01:22:57,570 --> 01:23:05,900
It was hard to know if this was part of the
plan or just madness.

1312
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:11,260
Somerset looked for the helicopter, but he
couldn't see it.

1313
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:15,929
He couldn't imagine what Doe wanted to do
here.

1314
01:23:15,929 --> 01:23:21,940
They were in the middle of nothing, but if
anything happened, the helicopter would be

1315
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:26,199
there like a cat on a mouse.

1316
01:23:26,199 --> 01:23:28,960
Doe was looking back down the road.

1317
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,789
"What time is it?" he asked.

1318
01:23:33,789 --> 01:23:36,440
"Why?" said Somerset.

1319
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:41,130
"What are you looking for?"

1320
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:43,880
He looked at his watch.

1321
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,650
It was just past seven.

1322
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:51,659
"It's close," Doe said.

1323
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:55,280
"It's coming."

1324
01:23:55,280 --> 01:24:04,179
In the distance, a white van was coming along
the road toward them, making a cloud of dust.

1325
01:24:04,179 --> 01:24:05,599
Somerset took out his gun.

1326
01:24:05,599 --> 01:24:10,860
"Stay with him," he shouted, and started running
toward the van.

1327
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:16,760
Mills pulled his gun and held Doe more tightly.

1328
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,320
"Wait!" he shouted at Somerset.

1329
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,309
But Somerset kept going.

1330
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:26,219
Mills put his gun to Doe's face.

1331
01:24:26,219 --> 01:24:31,719
"Don't move!" he said.

1332
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:32,719
***

1333
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:34,949
California tried to hear what Somerset was
saying.

1334
01:24:34,949 --> 01:24:38,929
There was a lot of noise on his radio.

1335
01:24:38,929 --> 01:24:42,579
"Delivery van..." he heard.

1336
01:24:42,579 --> 01:24:45,300
"Don't know what..."

1337
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:50,689
Did Somerset need him or not?

1338
01:24:50,689 --> 01:24:51,689
***

1339
01:24:51,689 --> 01:24:53,489
Doe was strangely calm.

1340
01:24:53,489 --> 01:25:03,369
"It's good we have some time to talk," he
said, and began walking toward Somerset.

1341
01:25:03,369 --> 01:25:08,539
"Down!" ordered Mills, pushing Doe to his
knees.

1342
01:25:08,539 --> 01:25:13,940
He kept his gun pointed at Doe while he watched
Somerset.

1343
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:17,600
Doe turned his head back.

1344
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,659
He was still smiling calmly.

1345
01:25:20,659 --> 01:25:27,380
"I envy you, Detective," he said.

1346
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:29,900
Somerset fired a warning shot into the air.

1347
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,400
The van stopped quickly.

1348
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,680
"Get out!" he shouted at the driver.

1349
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:41,579
"Get out with your hands over your head.

1350
01:25:41,579 --> 01:25:42,920
Now!"

1351
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,209
The driver got out, hands high.

1352
01:25:46,209 --> 01:25:50,070
"Don't shoot me!" he cried.

1353
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:52,130
"What do you want?

1354
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:53,710
Just tell me.

1355
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:56,510
I'll give you whatever you want!"

1356
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:59,639
"Who are you?"

1357
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:02,670
Somerset kept his gun pointing at the man.

1358
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:06,230
"What are you doing out here?"

1359
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:08,690
"I'm working.

1360
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:12,369
I'm delivering something."

1361
01:26:12,369 --> 01:26:14,829
"Who to?"

1362
01:26:14,829 --> 01:26:20,219
Somerset kept his gun to the man's head as
he opened the back of the van.

1363
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:25,030
"It's that one," the man pointed to a box.

1364
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:33,610
"This strange guy gave me five hundred dollars
to bring it out here, at seven o'clock exactly.

1365
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:36,110
I'm a little late, but..."

1366
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:40,820
"Get it out on the ground," Somerset ordered.

1367
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:41,869
"Slowly."

1368
01:26:41,869 --> 01:26:53,110
The delivery man put the box on the ground
and stepped back, his hands on his head.

1369
01:26:53,110 --> 01:27:01,639
Somerset saw that DETECTIVE DAVID MILLS was
written on the box.

1370
01:27:01,639 --> 01:27:02,639
***

1371
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,340
California could hear Somerset through the
noise.

1372
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:10,909
"There's a box here, it's from Doe...

1373
01:27:10,909 --> 01:27:13,770
Don't know what...

1374
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:16,630
Going to open -"

1375
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:21,790
"Call the bomb department," California told
the pilot.

1376
01:27:21,790 --> 01:27:23,699
"Get them out here quick."

1377
01:27:23,699 --> 01:27:29,309
"Should I go down?" asked the pilot.

1378
01:27:29,309 --> 01:27:30,369
"No.

1379
01:27:30,369 --> 01:27:31,420
Wait.

1380
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:36,699
He hasn't asked us yet."

1381
01:27:36,699 --> 01:27:37,699
***

1382
01:27:37,699 --> 01:27:40,560
Mills tried to see what Somerset was doing.

1383
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,959
The delivery man started to run.

1384
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:49,190
Somerset was chasing him away, ordering him
to run.

1385
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:51,710
Doe was still talking.

1386
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:57,260
"I wish I was an ordinary man," he said.

1387
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:02,590
"I wish I had a simple life."

1388
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:07,000
Somerset was on his knees, doing something
in the road.

1389
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:13,630
"What's going on?" said Mills to himself

1390
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:20,699
Somerset took out his knife and began to open
the box.

1391
01:28:20,699 --> 01:28:26,729
Inside was something heavy with plastic sheets
around it.

1392
01:28:26,729 --> 01:28:30,030
There was blood on the plastic.

1393
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:32,780
He looked inside.

1394
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:36,579
'Oh, Christ..."

1395
01:28:36,579 --> 01:28:41,550
He fell back onto the ground, suddenly weak.

1396
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:44,570
Not wanting to look.

1397
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,829
But he had to look.

1398
01:28:46,829 --> 01:28:52,110
"Oh, Christ, no..."

1399
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:54,969
He felt sick.

1400
01:28:54,969 --> 01:28:58,510
Mills could see that something was wrong.

1401
01:28:58,510 --> 01:29:00,449
He pulled Doe by the shoulder.

1402
01:29:00,449 --> 01:29:02,090
"Get up!

1403
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:03,139
Stand up!

1404
01:29:03,139 --> 01:29:05,000
Let's go!"

1405
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,840
Doe tried to walk, but he couldn't move fast
enough for Mills.

1406
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:15,869
"You've made a good life for yourself, Detective..."

1407
01:29:15,869 --> 01:29:18,119
"Shut up and walk!"

1408
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:21,249
ordered Mills angrily.

1409
01:29:21,249 --> 01:29:24,640
Somerset took deep breaths to keep himself
from falling.

1410
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,849
His legs were weak.

1411
01:29:27,849 --> 01:29:33,789
He held onto the van, his stomach turning
over.

1412
01:29:33,789 --> 01:29:42,039
When he looked up his eyes were full of tears,
and he couldn't see clearly, but Mills and

1413
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:44,639
Doe were coming toward him.

1414
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,489
"Oh, God, no, no..."

1415
01:29:46,489 --> 01:29:47,880
"Somerset," Mills shouted.

1416
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:54,860
"What the hell is going on?"

1417
01:29:54,860 --> 01:30:01,190
"Throw down your gun!"

1418
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:02,219
Somerset shouted.

1419
01:30:02,219 --> 01:30:05,679
"What are you talking about?"

1420
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:07,999
Mills shouted back.

1421
01:30:07,999 --> 01:30:10,900
Doe was still talking.

1422
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:21,849
"I'm trying to tell you how much I admire
you... and your pretty wife, Tracy."

1423
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:23,570
Mills turned around fast.

1424
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:27,269
"What did you say?"

1425
01:30:27,269 --> 01:30:30,219
Doe was smiling.

1426
01:30:30,219 --> 01:30:32,079
Somerset ran up to Mills.

1427
01:30:32,079 --> 01:30:35,320
"Throw down your gun!

1428
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,750
That's an order!"

1429
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:40,260
"You're retired!" said Mills.

1430
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:43,659
"I don't have to listen to you."

1431
01:30:43,659 --> 01:30:49,100
He moved closer to Doe, his gun pointed at
the killer's chest.

1432
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:55,709
"I visited your home this morning, Detective,"
said Doe.

1433
01:30:55,709 --> 01:30:58,469
"You weren't there.

1434
01:30:58,469 --> 01:31:00,789
I tried to play husband.

1435
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:07,000
Tried to be a simple man... but it didn't
work.

1436
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,699
I took something with me though."

1437
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:16,920
Mills's face showed his pain and confusion.

1438
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:21,409
He turned to Somerset for some answers.

1439
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:23,579
Somerset held out his hand.

1440
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:26,550
His eyes filled with tears.

1441
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:32,030
"Give me the gun," he said.

1442
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:37,080
"I took something to remember her by," said
Doe.

1443
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,070
"Her pretty head.

1444
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:45,710
I took it because I envy your ordinary life,
Detective.

1445
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:51,459
It seems that Envy is my sin.'

1446
01:31:51,459 --> 01:31:55,320
"It's not true!"

1447
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:58,929
screamed Mills, pushing his gun in Doe's face.

1448
01:31:58,929 --> 01:32:01,179
"Say it!

1449
01:32:01,179 --> 01:32:04,550
It's not true!"

1450
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:06,369
Somerset pulled Mills away.

1451
01:32:06,369 --> 01:32:10,869
"I can't let you do this, Mills."

1452
01:32:10,869 --> 01:32:14,420
"What's in the box, Somerset?

1453
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:15,460
Tell me!"

1454
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,900
Somerset couldn't say the words.

1455
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:23,989
"I just told you, Detective," said Doe calmly.

1456
01:32:23,989 --> 01:32:25,719
"Shut up!"

1457
01:32:25,719 --> 01:32:27,750
Mills shouted.

1458
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:31,690
"Become Wrath!"

1459
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:34,070
Doe wanted to make Mills more angry.

1460
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:36,059
"Shut your mouth!"

1461
01:32:36,059 --> 01:32:40,789
Mills hit Doe across the face with his gun.

1462
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:44,429
"This is what he wants, Mills.

1463
01:32:44,429 --> 01:32:45,979
Can't you see that?"

1464
01:32:45,979 --> 01:32:49,139
"Kill me, Detective."

1465
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:52,989
"He wants you to do it," said Somerset.

1466
01:32:52,989 --> 01:32:56,619
"Don't do what he wants.

1467
01:32:56,619 --> 01:33:01,760
Murder a suspect, Mills, and you throw everything
away.''

1468
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:05,380
"We'll say he tried to run, and I shot him.

1469
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:09,500
We'll work out the details later.

1470
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,790
No one has to know."

1471
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:14,479
"They'll get you, Mills.

1472
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:17,420
They won't care who he is.

1473
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:21,829
A cop who kills a suspect can't defend himself.

1474
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:24,260
Forget about it.

1475
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:25,639
You'll go to prison."

1476
01:33:25,639 --> 01:33:28,380
"I don't care."

1477
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:34,579
"If you're gone, Mills, who's going to fight
the fight?"

1478
01:33:34,579 --> 01:33:40,989
"Don't listen to him," said Doe softly.

1479
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:43,739
"Kill me!"

1480
01:33:43,739 --> 01:33:47,489
"You're wrong," Somerset argued.

1481
01:33:47,489 --> 01:33:52,940
"Who will take my place if you're not here?"

1482
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:58,190
"Tracy pleaded for her life, Detective.

1483
01:33:58,190 --> 01:34:03,300
And for the life of the baby inside her."

1484
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,139
Mills looked confused.

1485
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:10,559
His hands holding the gun were shaking wildly.

1486
01:34:10,559 --> 01:34:15,110
"You didn't know?"

1487
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:18,159
Doe looked shocked.

1488
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:21,389
Somerset was suddenly tired and weak.

1489
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:29,630
"If you kill him, Mills, he wins."

1490
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:37,310
Doe closed his eyes, his hands held together
in front of his face.

1491
01:34:37,310 --> 01:34:44,050
"Ok... he wins."

1492
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:53,030
Mills fired the gun, and the top of Doe's
head flew off as he fell backward.

1493
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:58,729
Bloody pieces lay in the dusty road.

1494
01:34:58,729 --> 01:35:00,980
Mills dropped his gun.

1495
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:10,550
He turned and started to walk, but only took
a few steps before he fell to his knees, holding

1496
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:15,059
his face in his hands.

1497
01:35:15,059 --> 01:35:16,510
Somerset looked at the body.

1498
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:24,579
A pool of blood spread from what was left
of Doe s head.

1499
01:35:24,579 --> 01:35:28,059
Somerset closed his eyes.

1500
01:35:28,059 --> 01:35:33,920
He didn't want to see anymore.

1501
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,920
***

1502
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:38,559
Two hours later Somerset was still there.

1503
01:35:38,559 --> 01:35:44,190
There was a circle of police cars with their
headlights shining on the crime scene.

1504
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:50,760
They had taken Mills away more than an hour
ago.

1505
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,559
The captain walked over to Somerset.

1506
01:35:53,559 --> 01:35:57,989
"It's over," he said.

1507
01:35:57,989 --> 01:36:00,209
"Go home."

1508
01:36:00,209 --> 01:36:03,190
"What happens to Mills now?"

1509
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:04,280
Somerset asked.

1510
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:10,400
"We'll get him a good lawyer, but he'll go
to prison.

1511
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,739
No doubt about that."

1512
01:36:12,739 --> 01:36:16,979
"So Doe did win.

1513
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:18,809
He got seven.

1514
01:36:18,809 --> 01:36:22,130
Eight, if you count Mills.

1515
01:36:22,130 --> 01:36:29,519
"Nine actually, if you count the... baby."

1516
01:36:29,519 --> 01:36:32,059
Somerset had a hard time saying it.

1517
01:36:32,059 --> 01:36:36,219
"Go home," the captain repeated.

1518
01:36:36,219 --> 01:36:39,380
"You're retired now."

1519
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:43,590
"I've changed my mind.

1520
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:45,699
I'm staying.

1521
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:47,429
I don't want to retire."

1522
01:36:47,429 --> 01:36:50,630
"Are you sure?"

1523
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:54,560
"I'm sure."

1524
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,719
He opened his car door.

1525
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:01,420
"See you Monday," he said.

1526
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:04,869
He knew he could never leave now.

1527
01:37:04,869 --> 01:37:11,179
With Mills gone, someone had to stay to fight
the fight.
