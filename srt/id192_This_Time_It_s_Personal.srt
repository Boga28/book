CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,440
New York in the spring

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,720
It was a fine but chilly spring morning. Fine 
enough even to make the New York borough of Queens  

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,440
seem attractive. Like any other day, I 
left my apartment on Main Street, Queens,  

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,120
and walked to the subway station to commute into 
midtown Manhattan on the number seven train.  

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,680
Like any other day, I read the New York 
Daily News to pass the time during the  

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,640
journey. Out of professional interest, I always 
glance through the day's fresh crime stories.  

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,400
Muggings, thefts, a car-jacking, a 
shooting, a bank robbery, and so on.  

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,800
Crime - the unpleasant reality of 
life from which I make my living.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,280
The name's Marley, Nat Marley, 
licensed private investigator.  

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:14,000
My prediction is that you already have a mental 
image of my type of work. I can safely bet that  

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,640
your image comes straight from the fantasy world 
of Hollywood. That's a long way from the truth.  

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,560
The majority of my work is dull. Often 
just pure routine stuff like divorce,  

14
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,840
bad debts, or missing persons. Don't imagine 
for a moment that I'm good-looking either.  

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,360
Just an ordinary-looking guy, bald, 
overweight and on the wrong side of forty.  

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,240
And let's get another thing straight, my 
working days seldom start with a wealthy,  

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,120
attractive female client anxiously 
waiting for my professional services.

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,880
My office is on East 43rd Street, just a 
couple of blocks from Grand Central Station.  

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,400
Stella Delgado, my personal assistant was 
already at her desk talking on the phone.

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,240
Stella's been with me most of the time I've been 
in business. A beautiful, intelligent Puerto Rican  

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:26,080
in her late twenties. If she wanted, she could 
get a far better job elsewhere. And I've told  

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:34,720
her that too. But she insists on working for me; 
she must like me. You've heard of the expression  

23
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,640
'on the wrong side of the tracks', meaning the 
poor, underprivileged areas of the inner city?  

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,240
That's where Stella grew up, in 
the Barrio on the Upper East Side,  

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,840
known as Spanish Harlem. She had left school 
early and got into plenty of trouble as a kid.  

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,600
Then it took years of night school 
study to catch up on her education.

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,480
As she put down the phone, I asked, "How are 
things on this beautiful spring morning?"

28
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,680
Silence. She just gave me a blank stare. 
The morning mail was on her desk, unopened.  

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Something was definitely wrong. "Stella, 
what's the matter? Come on, out with it."

30
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:33,760
She looked up at me tearfully. "Nat, I don't know 
what to do. It's family - my kid brother, Jose.  

31
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,280
I've just been talking to him on the phone. He's 
been arrested. He could be in serious trouble."

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:49,680
There was work to catch up with that morning, 
bills to send out to our satisfied or dissatisfied  

33
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,960
clients, and some annoying letters from 
the IRS, the tax people. Yet again,  

34
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,840
they'd claimed I hadn't paid enough tax. 
But clients and the IRS would have to wait.

35
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,640
"Stella, tell me everything."

36
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,920
"It's a long story. Jose was found by the police 
in the early hours of this morning on 112th Street  

37
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,120
just off Lexington Avenue, Upper East Side. 
He was lying unconscious with head injuries,  

38
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,160
in the driver's seat of a car that had 
crashed into a wall in a parking lot. Nat,  

39
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,880
he doesn't even own a car. Anyway, he was taken to 
the emergency room at Metropolitan Hospital. Now  

40
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:46,400
he's in a secure room under police guard. He was 
allowed to make one phone call, so he called me."

41
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,160
"So what's the story? How did 
he get into this mess?" I asked.

42
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,800
"The awful thing is he has no memory of what he 
was doing," Stella said. "All he can remember  

43
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,600
is being at some bar in Brighton Beach with 
his buddies yesterday evening. Then nothing."

44
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,520
"Has he been charged with anything?" I asked.

45
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,040
"No. At least, not as far 
as I know," replied Stella.

46
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,720
"Why were Jose and his buddies going out 
for a drink at Brighton Beach, anyway?  

47
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,480
That's quite a way from Spanish 
Harlem for a night out."

48
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,400
"Jose works in the summer at a diner on Surf 
Avenue, Coney Island. The place closes up  

49
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,480
in the winter. Jose had been to see his 
boss to confirm his job for next summer.  

50
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,760
He got some good news - they took him on 
as a cook. Jose had taken a couple of his  

51
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:56,000
buddies along to see if he could fix up work for 
them. They were taken on as waiters. Good money,  

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,240
plus room and board, starting first of April. 
Afterwards, they went out to celebrate."

53
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,480
The thought of Coney Island brought back 
some of those golden childhood memories:  

54
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,480
trips to Coney Island beach and the rides at the 
amusement park, family vacations at the beach.  

55
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,360
I put those thoughts to the back of my 
mind and concentrated on Stella's story.

56
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,320
"Anything more?" I asked.

57
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,240
"He said he had just a vague memory of a 
bar somewhere on Brighton Beach Avenue.  

58
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,120
He knew he'd had a few too many drinks. Then 
nothing until he woke up in a hospital bed."

59
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:50,000
"Maybe he's in shock," I suggested. "Temporary 
memory loss. If this was a simple case of  

60
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,080
drunk-driving, he wouldn't be under police 
guard. And where did he get the car from?"

61
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,840
"I don't know, Nat. Jose's 
never had a driver's license."

62
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,960
Not having a driver's license 
didn't mean he hadn't stolen the car  

63
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,880
and driven it anyway. But I 
didn't say that to Stella.

64
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,960
I thought for a moment. If Jose 
hadn't been charged with any offense,  

65
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,040
the NYPD could only hold him for a limited time.

66
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:29,680
"All right, Stella. This is what we'll do. If Jose 
hasn't been formally charged, there's no reason  

67
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,680
why we shouldn't be allowed to visit. We're going 
straight over to the hospital to talk with him."

68
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,920
Stella didn't move but just stood 
by her desk, biting her lip.

69
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,520
"Is something else bothering you?" I asked.

70
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:53,520
"Nat, I'm worried sick. Jose's an ordinary 
loveable guy who likes a good time.  

71
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,840
OK, he's got a criminal record. He got 
into some trouble when he was a teenager.  

72
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,120
But I know he's harmless. A danger to 
nobody. But someone with his background...  

73
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,160
you know as well as I do what 
conclusion the police will come to."

74
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,480
"Come on, Stella," I said. "Things have changed 
in this city. It's not like the bad old days.  

75
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,960
You know how sensitive the police are nowadays 
about any question of possible prejudice.  

76
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,160
You can't assume that the 
NYPD will think Jose is guilty  

77
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,120
because of his background. Any suspect 
has to be judged on the evidence."

78
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,280
"Maybe you're right," she replied, simply.

79
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,040
Stella didn't seem to be convinced. But 
I knew the NYPD would go to any lengths  

80
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,160
to avoid the kind of publicity an accusation 
of racial prejudice would attract.  

81
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:04,560
I also understood Stella's fears. Stella and her 
family are Puerto Rican. During the 1950s tens  

82
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,120
of thousands of Puerto Ricans emigrated from 
their island to the U.S.A. When they arrived,  

83
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,800
some of them discovered that the U.S.A. wasn't 
the land of opportunity they'd expected.  

84
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,960
Some had exchanged the poverty of Puerto 
Rico for the poor neighborhoods of New York.  

85
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,000
There were dead-end jobs waiting for them as 
kitchen hands or unskilled factory workers.  

86
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,960
Today, however, some have succeeded 
in creating a good life - like Stella,  

87
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:44,560
with a permanent job, comfortable apartment, 
and loving husband. But for Stella it had been  

88
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,280
a struggle. I could appreciate how her culture and 
background might affect the way she saw things.

89
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,520
"Lock up the office and let's go," I said.
 
 

90
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,680
CHAPTER TWO

91
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
Metropolitan Hospital

92
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,600
After a few inquiries at the main reception 
desk, we were finally given the location of  

93
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,880
Jose's room at the hospital. Eventually, when we 
reached the floor, it was obvious that gaining  

94
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,360
access would be no simple matter. There was a 
bored-looking police officer sitting outside.  

95
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,640
I thought I might start with a little gentle 
persuasion. It can sometimes work, even on  

96
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:38,320
police officers. I should know - I used to be 
an NYPD officer before I set up my own business.

97
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,160
"Excuse me," I said, showing the 
officer my investigator's license.  

98
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,840
"I represent Mr. Jose De La Cruz.  

99
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,920
Would it be possible to speak to him? The lady 
here is Ms. Delgado, sister of Mr. De La Cruz."

100
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,480
The officer was unimpressed. He 
looked me up and down and said flatly,  

101
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
"Sorry, sir. No one's allowed 
in. And that's official."

102
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,320
I wondered if he was going to be one of those 
people who get their job satisfaction by  

103
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,320
creating difficulties for others. I wasn't 
going to take 'no' as the final answer.  

104
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,520
"Come on, now. Just a quick 
word. Won't do any harm."

105
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,360
"No," replied the officer sharply. "This 
guy's a suspect. He's wanted for questioning."

106
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,080
"Suspected of doing what?" I demanded. 
"Has he been charged with any crime?"

107
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,880
"Don't know, and no."

108
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,600
"Thanks for all your co-operation. Give me 
the name of your boss, will you?" I asked.

109
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,720
It was Captain Oldenberg. A familiar name. 
Oldenberg and I had worked together at the NYPD.  

110
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,240
That was over fifteen years ago, when we'd both 
been patrolmen on the streets of the Lower East  

111
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:15,120
Side. Since I'd left the NYPD to become a private 
eye, Oldenberg had risen through the ranks and had  

112
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:24,080
now been promoted to captain. Every now and then 
our professional paths crossed. Oldenberg was the  

113
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:31,360
sort of guy you didn't forget in a hurry. He could 
be bad- tempered, loud, and dominating at times.  

114
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,960
Despite that, he was basically a good cop. I'd 
need all my charm to deal with him, though.

115
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,720
"Thanks. I'll be back," I said.

116
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,600
Stella was looking furious. "Nat! Exactly 
what is going on here?" she demanded as  

117
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,120
we walked away from the room. "Are you 
just going to take 'no' for an answer?"

118
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:05,840
"Stay calm, Stella. In this situation we need 
friends, not enemies. I'll call Oldenberg."

119
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,760
I phoned police headquarters and was 
put through to Oldenberg's office.  

120
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,840
He wasn't exactly pleased to hear from me. 
That was normal. He was even less pleased  

121
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,520
when I asked if Jose was free to leave once 
the doctors had given him the all clear.

122
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,760
"You've got to be joking, Marley!" he shouted. 
"There's no way I'm going to let that guy out on  

123
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,480
the streets. He's being held on 'reasonable 
suspicion'. I've had a crime scene team  

124
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,840
examining the car De La Cruz was found in, and 
I'm waiting for the results of forensic tests."

125
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:55,120
Tests to examine what? Bloodstains 
on clothes? DNA? A weapon?  

126
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,800
I tried my charm on Oldenberg again.

127
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,320
"I'd be interested to know what 
those tests would be for," I said.

128
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,320
"Sure you would.  

129
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:13,680
Marley, you know I can't reveal any details of 
evidence until the suspect has been charged."

130
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,760
It was the answer I'd been expecting. 
No harm in having another try.

131
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,880
"Have you established who was the owner 
of the vehicle?" I asked hopefully.

132
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,840
"Same as my previous answer," he replied bluntly.

133
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,760
I got the impression that the captain was enjoying 
himself. One last attempt to make some progress.

134
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:46,720
"OK, Oldenberg. I know your position. Rules 
have to be obeyed. But if my client hasn't been  

135
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,440
charged, why can't I speak to him? I have his 
sister with me and she's upset in a big way.  

136
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,280
Just ten minutes? And I'll agree to 
the police officer being present too."

137
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,960
"All right, Marley. Have your ten minutes. I'll 
call the officer and tell him to expect you."

138
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,920
We hurried back to speak to Jose. The officer 
showed us into his room. Jose was sitting up in  

139
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:23,840
bed, with a bandage around his head and an IV 
drip attached to his arm. There was a hopeless  

140
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:30,880
expression on his face. Stella went over to 
him, took his hand, and spoke to him gently.

141
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,520
"How are you feeling, Jose?"

142
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:44,720
"Not great. I'm full of painkillers, but I can 
still feel my head spinning," said Jose. "Stella,  

143
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:51,600
it's real good to see you. Are you going to get 
me out of here? I haven't done anything wrong."

144
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,160
"You and I both know you 
haven't done anything wrong,"  

145
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,320
she said. "Remember what I told you, 
Jose. You've got to keep holding on."

146
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,280
"So what's the cop doing here, huh?" asked 
Jose, glancing in the direction of the officer.

147
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,120
"We had to agree to the officer being present.  

148
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,960
Jose, this is my boss, Nat 
Marley. He's going to help you."

149
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,280
"I'm sure glad to see you, Nat," said Jose.

150
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,240
"If we're going to help you, you've got to give 
us the whole story. Don't hold anything back."  

151
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,840
I said. "Everything that happened 
from the time you left home yesterday  

152
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,920
until you woke up in this hospital bed."

153
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:46,000
Jose, with his two friends, Miguel and Carlos, 
took the subway to Coney Island to find work.  

154
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,840
The boss at the diner offered him a job as a 
cook and Jose's buddies were taken on as waiters.  

155
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,880
Jose showed Miguel and Carlos 
around the sights of Coney Island  

156
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:05,600
during the afternoon. After stopping for food, 
they moved on to Brighton Beach to celebrate.  

157
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:13,120
By early evening they'd had several drinks in 
bars on Brighton Beach Avenue, in the heart of  

158
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:22,080
the Russian community. He had a confused memory 
of waking up in a bar. His buddies had gone. Then  

159
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:28,320
nothing. The next thing he remembered 
was waking up in Metropolitan Hospital.

160
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,400
"You don't remember anything else?" I asked.

161
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,080
"Nothing. It's the honest truth, Nat," 
said Jose. "It's all a black fog."

162
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,560
"Brighton Beach? Kind of an unusual night out for 
three guys from Upper Manhattan, huh?" I asked.

163
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,720
"You're right. At first it felt 
kind of strange for us to be there,"  

164
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,040
said Jose, "but people were nice and didn't 
mind three outsiders having a night out.  

165
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,320
One bartender got friendly when we asked 
him about all the different vodkas."

166
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:13,840
"Now think hard, Jose. Can you 
remember anything else?" I asked.

167
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,320
"Nothing," he replied.

168
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
"What happened to Miguel and Carlos?"

169
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,840
"I can't remember."

170
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,600
It didn't look good. Jose had been found 
unconscious at the wheel of a car that wasn't  

171
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,920
his. He had no memory of what had happened 
after passing out in a Brighton Beach bar.

172
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,120
"Jose, I know you don't have a driver's 
license, but can you drive?" I asked.

173
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,960
"No way, Nat. I've never tried. And even if 
I could, I'd have been too drunk to drive."

174
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,400
The police officer interrupted 
us: "Time's up, Mr. Marley."

175
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:03,360
There wasn't any point in asking for more 
time. I didn't think we were going to learn  

176
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,880
anything more of value. As to what had actually 
happened, it was still a complete mystery.  

177
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,160
Was Jose the victim or was he the guilty party?

178
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,560
My impression of him from our brief 
talk was of a harmless ordinary guy;  

179
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,960
a guy who had gotten into some sort of trouble 
and had no explanation for what had happened.

180
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,640
It wasn't looking good. There was some small 
hope though, since I'd gotten clients out of  

181
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:44,800
worse situations than this. Jose needed a lawyer, 
urgently, and I knew just the woman for the job:  

182
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:54,480
Lena Rosenthal. She was capable, intelligent, and 
tough; someone who could stand up to Oldenberg.  

183
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,080
As soon as Jose was charged with a crime, then 
we would have something concrete from the NYPD.  

184
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,160
Otherwise, we were just operating in the dark.

185
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:15,040
Stella had to get back to her family, so I gave 
her the rest of the day off. I just wished I could  

186
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:21,360
say something that might give her some comfort. 
But I knew whatever I said would be inadequate.  

187
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,040
Once I had more information, then I 
might be able to offer her some hope.

188
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,080
The next day, the temperature 
was close to freezing.  

189
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,680
A layer of frost covered the windows of cars 
parked on the street overnight. I'd arrived  

190
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,760
at the office early and was just putting the 
breakfast coffee and donuts down on the desk  

191
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,920
when the phone rang. A familiar voice 
barked at me - Captain Oldenberg.

192
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,560
"Marley? Just calling to tell you that your client 
De La Cruz is still being held at the hospital.  

193
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,120
I wanted to get him moved to 
headquarters for further questioning,  

194
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,280
but the doctors insisted he be kept under 
observation. I'm still waiting for the  

195
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,520
results of the tests on bloodstains found on 
his jacket and a wallet in his possession."

196
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:27,040
Oldenberg had given away a few more details. 
Bloodstains? Things were getting more serious.

197
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:36,000
In desperation I said: "Oldenberg, my client 
can't drive. And what's more, the alcohol  

198
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,360
level from the blood tests should indicate 
he'd have been incapable of driving anyway."

199
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,840
"Marley, don't make me laugh," he replied.

200
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,200
"My client needs to consult his lawyer.  

201
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,840
With your permission, I'd like to take her over 
to the hospital this morning. Any objections?"

202
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,320
"Be my guest, Marley. I'll call the officer 
on duty and tell him to expect you."

203
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:12,480
By now Stella had arrived. I told her the latest 
developments. She took it all in silently then sat  

204
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,800
in front of her computer with her head in her 
hands. I arranged to pick up Lena Rosenthal.

205
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,320
Later, as our cab headed up First 
Avenue towards the hospital,  

206
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,680
I gave Lena all the details she needed about 
Jose's case. I also explained how I was involved.

207
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,840
"Lena, this isn't just a routine case for me. 
This guy's the kid brother of my assistant,  

208
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Stella Delgado. Stella's been working for me 
so long that she's like part of my family.  

209
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,840
I feel responsible for both Stella and Jose. 
You could say it's personal this time."

210
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,400
Lena nodded. "Thanks for telling me, 
Nat. Anything else I should know?"

211
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,080
"I should warn you about Captain Oldenberg.  

212
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,480
He has a reputation for being 
aggressive and insensitive."

213
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,440
"Oldenberg and I have met before. I 
know what to expect," replied Lena.

214
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,840
At the hospital, before we saw 
Jose, a doctor took us aside.

215
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,840
"Excuse me. Are you family?" she asked.

216
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,840
"We represent Mr. De La Cruz. The name's Nat 
Marley, private investigator," I replied,  

217
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,920
flashing my I.D. at the doctor. "This 
is his lawyer Ms. Rosenthal. We have  

218
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,120
permission from the NYPD to visit our client."

219
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:51,280
"Thank you. I'm Dr. Ericson. Mr. De La Cruz 
has been under my care since he was admitted.  

220
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:59,280
His condition has been giving me cause for 
concern. In the accident, he received a heavy blow  

221
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:06,880
to the head. So far his condition has been stable, 
but there have been some symptoms that worry me.  

222
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:15,040
He's complained about seeing double images and he 
has twice lost consciousness, though very briefly.  

223
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:22,640
And also there's some memory loss. So, I 
must warn you not to put Mr. De La Cruz  

224
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,280
under any unnecessary stress. He's been through 
enough already, and with any further stress..."

225
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,800
"Understood, Doctor. We'll take great care."

226
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,480
Before seeing Jose, Lena turned to 
me. "It would be a good idea not to  

227
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,240
mention anything about the forensic tests. 
This guy sounds scared enough already."

228
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,720
I nodded my agreement.

229
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,360
Eventually we were allowed in to speak 
to Jose. He looked at us with dull eyes  

230
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,640
and raised a hand to acknowledge us. 
I could see the despair in his eyes.  

231
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,400
Lena went over exactly the same 
questions as I had asked before.  

232
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:17,760
There was nothing more that Jose could add. We 
had made no further progress. As we were leaving,  

233
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:28,560
Jose cried out hopelessly: "Nat, for God's sake, 
get me out of here! I'm going out of my mind."
 
 

234
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,120
CHAPTER THREE

235
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,800
Jones Beach

236
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,720
Saturday morning was cold but 
bright. I was feeling fit and active.  

237
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,960
I started the day by following my Saturday 
routine. Buying the Daily News and wandering  

238
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:59,200
down Main Street, Queens, to Slim Pete's Diner. 
Breakfast there was always reliable - unhealthy  

239
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,680
but very tasty. Maybe that explained 
'Slim' Pete's weight problem.

240
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,280
"Morning, Nat," said Slim Pete. "Why so cheerful?"

241
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:20,720
"Pete, I now realize that a healthy lifestyle is 
no solution to a mid-life crisis - which means  

242
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,480
I'll have one of your breakfast 
specials and plenty of coffee."

243
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,640
As I worked my way through breakfast, 
I looked through the Daily News.  

244
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,840
There was a story about a murder victim. 
A guy by the name of Alexei Romanov.  

245
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:46,400
Where had I heard the name 'Romanov' before? 
That was it, the old Russian royal family.  

246
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:55,120
The body had been found late Friday afternoon, 
floating in Coney Island Creek. The victim had  

247
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:02,640
been shot in the head and had been dead for over 
twenty-four hours. There were some more details.  

248
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,360
Romanov owned some kind of business on 
Brighton Beach. He was involved in a  

249
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,200
society that helped immigrants from Russia 
to settle and adapt to life in the U.S.A.  

250
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,720
His tearful widow told reporters that she 
had no idea who could have done such a thing.  

251
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,840
He seemed to have been a 
well-liked and respected man  

252
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,320
who was active in the community. I hoped and 
prayed there was no connection with Jose.

253
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,680
Another story caught my eye. The headline 
read: 'Wreck on Jones Beach'. Part of  

254
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:49,280
a lifeboat had been washed up on the 
shore. Two bodies had been found nearby.  

255
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:57,040
No further details. I'd been brought 
up on Staten Island. As a kid,  

256
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:05,600
just taking the ferry across to Manhattan seemed 
like a big adventure. A day out on Coney Island  

257
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,400
was a real trip, but Jones Beach, on 
Long Island, felt like going abroad.  

258
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:21,280
Maybe there's something of that kid still left 
inside me. I still get a thrill when I get way  

259
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:28,080
out of the city and stand on the beach looking 
out at the Atlantic, watching the waves crashing.  

260
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,560
Why not escape from the city for the 
day? The ocean air would do me good.

261
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,320
I was folding up the newspaper 
when Slim Pete came over to chat.

262
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,800
"So what's New York's smartest private eye doing? 
Putting more gangsters behind bars?" he asked.

263
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,680
"Funny you should say that," I answered. 
"New York's criminal community can relax.  

264
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,080
I've just decided I'm going 
to spend a day at the beach."

265
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,000
"Huh! A life of leisure. It's 
all right for some people."

266
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,600
I took the bus from Main Street, to Jamaica 
Station. You can connect there with the Long  

267
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:22,560
Island Rail Road to Freeport. From there, I took 
a cab to Jones Beach, a long narrow strip of land  

268
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:29,200
about two miles from the mainland. There was a 
real chill in the wind coming in off the ocean.  

269
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,160
Enough to keep any crowds away so early 
in the year. In the height of the season,  

270
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:42,080
thousands of New Yorkers crowd into the 
area to claim their little piece of beach.  

271
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,800
But today I could walk without tripping 
over beach towels or bumping into umbrellas.

272
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:57,040
I strolled along the shore for about an hour, 
then returned. Unusually energetic for me,  

273
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,080
but I felt better afterwards. 
The air was clean and fresh.  

274
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,120
Then I stood for a while on the Atlantic 
side, watching the waves crash onto the beach.  

275
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:17,200
I knew why I had really come here. It was the 
reports of the bodies washed up on the beach.  

276
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,560
It was my day off, but I was 
still playing the investigator.  

277
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:30,480
That was why my marriage had broken up. My wife 
never saw much of me when I was with the NYPD.  

278
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:39,120
When I started out on my own as a private 
investigator she saw even less of me. Then  

279
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,920
one day she walked out on me. She left a 
note which said that I just didn't give her  

280
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:53,600
enough attention and she couldn't carry on 
like that. The sad truth was she was right.  

281
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,600
If there's ever a second Mrs. Marley, she'll have 
to be one very tolerant lady to put up with me.

282
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,800
I wandered over to a group of bars and restaurants  

283
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,360
which would be packed with 
visitors in a few weeks.  

284
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,840
One or two were already open, while in others work 
was going on in preparation for the coming season.  

285
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,760
Outside a bar an old guy up on a ladder was 
painting. He looked down at me from his work.

286
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:34,320
"You're out of luck if you want a drink, mister. 
We don't open till the first of April," he said.

287
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,680
"Just wanted to talk if it's 
not holding you up," I replied.

288
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:46,480
"Go ahead and talk, mister. I'm just 
doing this as a favor for my son-in-law.  

289
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,680
He doesn't care how slowly I work."

290
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,600
"I see Jones Beach has been in the news.  

291
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,800
Some story about a lifeboat found wrecked 
along the shore and two bodies," I said.

292
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,000
The old man came down from 
the ladder. A good sign.  

293
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:14,000
I had got his interest. He pointed west 
along the shore with a dripping paintbrush.

294
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,840
"The wrecked lifeboat was found about a mile 
west along the beach. There's an old lady - when  

295
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,880
I say old, she's a good ten years older than 
me. Well, she goes beachcombing regularly.  

296
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,960
You know, looking for shells and stuff. 
She found the wreck and the bodies."

297
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,000
"Really! Must have been quite 
a shock for her," I said.

298
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,680
"I don't know about that, mister. It 
made her day. Never seen her so excited."

299
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,920
It was time to make my move. I 
showed him my investigator's license.

300
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:02,480
"Gee! A real private eye!" exclaimed the 
old man. "I would've expected someone..."

301
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,080
"Someone younger and 
better-looking?" I interrupted.  

302
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:14,320
"We come in all shapes and sizes. Look, 
I'm investigating this wreck for a client,"  

303
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:20,560
I lied. "I'd like to talk to this lady. 
Who is she, and where can I find her?"

304
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:29,440
"Her name's Edith Tilden. People call her 'Edie'. 
She's English, but she's lived here for years.  

305
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:37,840
She looks kind of eccentric, but she's OK once 
you get talking. See that place over there?"

306
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,240
The old man pointed toward a 
beat-up building with the sign  

307
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,160
'Ornella's Italian Clam House' above the entrance.

308
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,640
"She'll probably be in there," he continued.  

309
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,120
"She claims Ornella's the only person on 
Jones Beach who can make a good cup of tea."

310
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,680
Life's full of surprises. Since 
when did Italians make good tea?  

311
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,680
I entered the restaurant. It didn't look open 
for business. Most of the tables and chairs  

312
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:19,280
were piled up in a corner. Only a handful of 
tables were set. At one of the tables sat a  

313
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:26,160
little old lady dressed in bright yellow and 
purple. A plump, cheerful woman welcomed me.

314
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:35,200
"Morning, mister. No hot food until April. 
Just snacks and hot and cold drinks." she said.

315
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,120
"I was looking for a sandwich and 
a cup of tea. I've been told that  

316
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,720
you make the best tea in Jones Beach," I replied.

317
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,520
The old woman at the table looked up and said, 
"You've come to the right place for tea."

318
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,480
"Then make that two teas - one for the lady here."

319
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:06,720
I went over to her table. "Mind if I join you?" I 
asked. "Not at all," she answered. "Take a seat."

320
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,880
I noticed the way she spoke. Not 
the slightest American accent.

321
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,880
"Thanks. You English?" I asked.

322
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:25,040
"I'm probably as American as you are, now. 
I've been in the U.S.A. for fifty years  

323
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:32,000
but never lost the accent or the tea-drinking 
habit. The name's Edie, Edie Tilden."

324
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,840
"Pleased to meet you. I'm Nat Marley."

325
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,080
The sandwich and teas were 
brought over to the table.  

326
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,440
After small talk about the weather, 
it was time to get some information.  

327
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:54,080
I showed Edie my private investigator's license. 
Her eyes grew large and round and her mouth  

328
00:35:54,080 --> 00:36:01,440
dropped open. This old lady was deeply impressed. 
I wish I had that effect on people more often.

329
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,040
"I hear you found the wrecked 
lifeboat and two bodies on the beach.  

330
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,840
I'm investigating the wreck 
for a client," I lied again.

331
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,520
Edie waved her teaspoon at me excitedly.  

332
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:24,240
"Mr. Marley, I've been walking up and down 
this beach for years. I've found bits and  

333
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:33,920
pieces of boats, but never a body. Two real dead 
bodies! What do you say to that?" she asked.

334
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,920
"Must have been a terrible shock," I said.

335
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,400
"People don't look pretty 
after they've been in the sea."

336
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840
"Can you describe them?" I asked.

337
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:54,240
"Certainly. Two young men, could be 
anywhere in their twenties. Medium height.  

338
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:02,800
Thin. Both of them looked as if they needed a good 
meal. Short hair. They hadn't shaved for days.  

339
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,520
Cheap-looking clothes. One of them had 
a gold cross on a chain around his neck.  

340
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,080
I've never seen one like it 
before. Let me show you."

341
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:22,000
She paused, took a clean paper napkin from 
the table, found a pencil in her pocket,  

342
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,160
and drew a picture of a cross with two 
horizontal bars, the top one a little shorter.  

343
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:37,360
Then at the base of the cross, a short bar at a 
forty-five degree angle. I didn't recognize it.

344
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,760
"Thanks. Mind if I keep this?" I asked. 
"Now what can you remember about the boat?"

345
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,160
"What I found was the rear half.  

346
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:57,120
Probably from a boat big enough to fit a dozen 
people in. It had seen better days, though."

347
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,880
"What do you mean?"

348
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:08,720
"The wood was rotten with age. Some of it was so 
soft I could break off pieces with my bare hands.  

349
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,960
It looked like someone had 
been trying to repair it,  

350
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,000
but hadn't made a good job of it. 
The boat must have split in two."

351
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,720
"Were there any identifying marks? 
Like names or numbers?" I asked.

352
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:33,200
"Some letters at the back, maybe the boat's 
name," Edie answered. "I couldn't make out  

353
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:40,080
a complete word, but it looked like a foreign 
language. And that's about all I can tell you.  

354
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,000
The Coast Guard took it away 
so there's nothing to see now.

355
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,480
"Thanks. You've been very helpful.  

356
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,480
Here's my card. Where can I contact 
you if I need to speak to you again?"

357
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,960
She wrote a Freeport address and phone number on 
the paper. I left Edie and did some more beach  

358
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,200
walking. I felt relaxed and content when 
I finally got back to Queens that evening.  

359
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,720
But there was still the problem of Jose.  

360
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:19,760
Unless I turned up some new evidence soon, 
he could be facing a long prison sentence.

361
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,400
The next day I woke up early but was feeling 
active. It must have been the effect of all that  

362
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:36,880
exercise the day before. There are various ways 
to spend your Sunday. Unfortunately, I had to  

363
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:44,240
go into the office to sort out some accounts. On 
the subway, I glanced through the Sunday edition  

364
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:51,440
of the Daily News. It didn't have anything to 
add to yesterday's stories. At the office on  

365
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,760
East 43rd Street, I was trying to make sense of 
the previous year's accounts when the phone rang.  

366
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:07,280
Who on earth wanted to speak to me at this time on 
a Sunday? I grabbed the phone. It was Oldenberg.

367
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,000
"Marley, trust you to be 
in the office on a Sunday.  

368
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,520
Just wanted to bring you 
up to date on your client."

369
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,720
I immediately felt tense. "Go on," I said.

370
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,480
"I'm on my way back from Metropolitan  

371
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,720
Hospital," said Oldenberg. "De La 
Cruz has been charged with murder."
 
 

372
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,960
CHAPTER FOUR

373
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,840
East Harlem

374
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:45,680
"Oldenberg," I began, "you've got a confused guy 
in a hospital bed with serious head injuries,  

375
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,360
and you add to the misery with a murder charge!"

376
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,760
"Just doing my job, Marley," he 
replied. "Following procedure."

377
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,280
"Who's the murder victim?" I asked.

378
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,160
"A guy by the name of Alexei Romanov, 
some businessman from Brighton Beach."

379
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,400
The same guy I'd read about in the Daily News.  

380
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:18,080
"OK, Oldenberg. You'd better explain how you 
reached the conclusion that my client's a killer."

381
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:26,160
Oldenberg went on to give me the details. 
The cause of death was a shot to the head  

382
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,480
from the pistol which was found in the car. Jose's 
fingerprints were on the handle and trigger.  

383
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,720
The results of the forensic tests proved 
that he was the attacker. Romanov's blood  

384
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:48,640
was found on Jose's jacket. Also, the NYPD 
had positive identification of a wallet  

385
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:57,200
found in his possession - it belonged to Romanov. 
The police had the murder weapon, the killer,  

386
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,720
and forensic evidence. As far as Oldenberg 
was concerned, the investigation was closed.  

387
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,200
I had serious doubts. All the evidence 
pointed toward Jose, but what was the motive?

388
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,960
"OK, Oldenberg. Have you 
established a motive?" I asked.

389
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,480
"Maybe he saw the opportunity to get some easy 
money - a carjacking, I guess," he answered.

390
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,840
Again, I wasn't convinced.  

391
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,760
Could a sleepy drunk possibly be capable of 
carjacking and murder? "What do you mean,  

392
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,840
'I guess'? Where's the supporting 
evidence? Do you have witnesses?" I asked.

393
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,480
"Who needs witnesses with the amount of 
evidence piled up against him?" Oldenberg asked.

394
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:58,400
No point in continuing the conversation. 
I'd learned enough. The significant point  

395
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,920
was the lack of witnesses. Oldenberg 
obviously thought that the forensic  

396
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:11,200
evidence was enough to prove Jose was guilty. 
Someone must have seen Jose and his buddies  

397
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,760
celebrating that night. I'd have to go to 
Brighton Beach to do some of my own investigating.

398
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:26,080
Meanwhile, I needed to check on Jose. A call 
to the hospital confirmed that his condition  

399
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,560
was stable, but the doctors were 
still keeping him under observation.  

400
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:37,920
It seemed unlikely that he would be allowed 
to leave the hospital. But Jose was better off  

401
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:46,880
there than in a cell. Another call, this time to 
Stella. I brought her up to date on developments.  

402
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:55,040
I also needed to get a clearer picture of exactly 
what had happened on Wednesday night. I had to  

403
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:02,160
speak to one of Jose's buddies. Stella promised 
to set up a meeting with them as soon as possible.

404
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,840
A few minutes later, Stella called back.

405
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:14,720
"Nat? I've set up a meeting with Carlos and 
Miguel. Can you get over here now?... Yes?...  

406
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:25,600
Good. We'll be at my mom's apartment, 1295 
First Ave, apartment 104, on the tenth floor.  

407
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,840
That's the East River Housing, on First 
Avenue between 102nd and 105th Streets.  

408
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,400
We'll be expecting you. Call me on my cell 
phone if you have any problem finding it.

409
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:47,920
There wouldn't be any problem. The area 
was Spanish Harlem, and I'd walked most  

410
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:55,680
of those streets when I was an NYPD patrolman. 
My only hope was that his buddies would remember  

411
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:04,080
something that had slipped Jose's mind, anything. 
I took an uptown local train from Grand Central  

412
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:11,120
to 103rd Street, then walked the three blocks 
across town to the East River Housing project.  

413
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,760
In the space of those seven subway stops, the 
city changes completely. In Spanish Harlem,  

414
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:26,640
there's not a skyscraper in sight. Only a 
few remaining traditional brownstone houses  

415
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,240
among the anonymous gray concrete 
blocks of the housing projects.

416
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,280
I was shown into a comfortably furnished room  

417
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,480
overlooking the East River, with a view of 
Wards Island at the southern tip of the Bronx.  

418
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,880
Jose's buddies were there. Two 
ordinary-looking guys in their early twenties.

419
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:54,160
Stella introduced us. "Nat. I'd 
like you to meet Miguel and Carlos.  

420
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:02,080
This is my boss, Nat. He's like family to me, 
and we're doing everything we can to help Jose.  

421
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,120
I want you to tell everything to 
Nat just like you told it to me."

422
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,120
"All of it? Again?" asked Carlos.

423
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,680
"Yes, every bit. You might recall 
something that could help Jose," she said.

424
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:27,120
Carlos began. Much of what they said confirmed 
what we already knew from Jose's story: the  

425
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:33,680
interview at the diner, the sightseeing tour of 
Coney Island, the bars on Brighton Beach Avenue.  

426
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:42,240
What I was really interested in was the 
final bar where Jose had fallen asleep.

427
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,720
"We ended up in this bar that had 
every kind of vodka you could imagine,"  

428
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,800
continued Carlos. "The bartender in there got 
friendly when we took an interest in the drinks.  

429
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,840
He was recommending what to try."

430
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,040
"The name of the bar?" I asked.

431
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,000
"Sorry, Nat. I don't remember," replied Carlos.

432
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:13,520
"So, some bar, somewhere in Brighton Beach, 
selling lots of different vodkas. Could be  

433
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:20,160
one of many in New York's Little Odessa. Can 
you remember anything else about the bar?"

434
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:27,920
"The walls were covered with baseball 
stuff. Team photos, shirts, bats...  

435
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:35,040
that sort of thing. I remember asking the 
bartender, 'Hey, what's all this? Baseball  

436
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,640
in the middle of the Russian community?' 
Apparently the owner's a huge baseball fan."

437
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:50,080
"Good," I said. "There can't be too many bars like 
that in Little Odessa. How long did you stay?"

438
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,520
"We tried all these different flavored vodkas. 
After an hour or so, I knew I'd had too much.  

439
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:06,480
My head was spinning. Jose had fallen asleep, 
and I knew we'd have to help him home. We needed  

440
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:12,080
to get sober for the subway ride, so Miguel 
and I went out to find some black coffee.  

441
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:19,520
We found a place that had coffee to go. 
Carlos waited outside the bar with the coffees  

442
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:26,800
while I went inside to get Jose. But there 
was no sign of him. I asked the bartender,  

443
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,600
but he didn't know. We just thought 
he'd woken up and gone home."

444
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,880
"Thanks. You've been a great help. Call 
Stella if you remember anything more," I said.

445
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:48,800
Progress at last. I now had a starting point 
for my investigation. I had to find the bar  

446
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:56,000
that Jose and his friends had gone to. 
Now I had a lead: the baseball connection.  

447
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,840
Suddenly, my cell phone rang. 
It was Captain Oldenberg.

448
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:10,960
"Marley? It's your client De La Cruz. The guy's 
gone crazy. He broke out of an operating room  

449
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,120
and somehow climbed up on the roof of the 
hospital. He's threatening to throw himself off.  

450
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:23,680
He might listen to you. Can you come right 
now and help talk some sense into him?"
 
 

451
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,080
CHAPTER FIVE

452
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,520
A matter of life or death

453
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:41,360
Metropolitan Hospital is only three blocks 
downtown on First Avenue. Stella ran on ahead  

454
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:46,400
and I hurried after her. I was 
completely out of breath when I arrived.  

455
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:54,320
Outside the main entrance was a collection of 
various NYPD vehicles and a Fire Department truck  

456
00:49:54,320 --> 00:50:00,560
with a ladder. Barriers had been set up around 
the base of the building with signs that read:  

457
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:08,720
'Police line. Do not cross.' High up on the top 
of the building, sitting on the edge of the roof,  

458
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:16,960
I could make out a figure. It was Jose. If 
he jumped, there was no way he'd survive.

459
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:24,160
Among the police vehicles was a large 
blue van marked 'Tactical Response Unit.'  

460
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:32,320
That's police language, which translated means 
'a negotiation team.' These are the people whose  

461
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:41,280
weapons are words, not guns. They will negotiate 
for hours or days to prevent a crime or a tragedy.  

462
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:49,200
I was relieved to see them here. Those guys are 
so calm compared to officers like Oldenberg.  

463
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,480
They wouldn't get impatient watching paint dry.  

464
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,360
If it takes forty-eight hours 
to prevent a potential death by  

465
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:05,920
talking to the guy, hour after hour, they'll do 
it. Persuasion, not force, is their philosophy.

466
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,240
Oldenberg was waiting for us outside the entrance.  

467
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,080
"Er, Marley," he began, "this 
is kind of embarrassing..."

468
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:26,160
I cut him off. "Embarrassing? It's a disaster! 
How on earth did my client end up on the roof?"  

469
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,640
I demanded. "I thought you had 
him under twenty-four-hour guard.  

470
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:37,920
What's been going on here? Is this 
another example of NYPD inefficiency?"

471
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,480
As we hurried through the hospital corridors, 
Oldenberg raised his hands in apology.  

472
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:52,720
"I can't offer any excuses. Your client had been 
taken to an operating room. The police officer  

473
00:51:52,720 --> 00:52:01,120
was told that De La Cruz was unconscious, so he 
decided to take an unofficial break outside. The  

474
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:06,640
medical team had to leave De La Cruz temporarily 
while they attended to a more urgent case.  

475
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:13,040
During that time, he must have regained 
consciousness, panicked and gone up to the roof."

476
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:22,480
An elevator took us up to the top floor. We were 
taken through a door marked: 'No entry.' At the  

477
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,720
foot of the stairs to the roof, Dr. Ericson 
was waiting. She looked nervous and anxious.

478
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:37,200
"Mr. Marley and Ms. Delgado, thank God you're 
here. My patient needs people he knows and trusts.  

479
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:44,480
You know he should be in the operating room? He 
was being prepared for surgery before escaping  

480
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,480
wearing only a surgical gown. He's seriously ill.  

481
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,400
I'm not trying to be dramatic, but 
this is a matter of life or death."

482
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,240
"Thanks, Doctor. I understand 
your concern," I said.

483
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:07,440
"One more thing, Mr. Marley. There are some 
curious bruise marks on Mr. De La Cruz's neck.  

484
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,880
Like someone had gripped him violently.  

485
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,880
He couldn't have received injuries 
like that in a car crash."

486
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,840
The doctor put her fingers and thumb 
around her throat to demonstrate.

487
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,040
"I told Captain Oldenberg, but he 
didn't seem to take any notice.  

488
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,840
I don't like that man's attitude."

489
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,760
"Me neither," I replied. "Thanks for 
telling me. It could be very important."

490
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:43,120
We climbed the stairs to the roof. Outside, 
the wind was bitterly cold. A woman was sitting  

491
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:50,160
on a low wall a few yards away from Jose. 
Detective Valdez from the negotiation team.  

492
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:57,280
Jose was sitting on the wall, wrapped 
up in a blanket from the operating room,  

493
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,680
with one leg hanging over the edge.

494
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:08,960
Stella and I cautiously made our way along the 
roof. I don't like heights, especially when the  

495
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:15,520
only protection from a fatal drop is a 
knee-high wall. We sat down beside her.

496
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,160
"Mr. Marley and Ms. Delgado?" she said in a 
whisper, with her face turned away from Jose.  

497
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:29,760
"I'm very relieved to see you here. The 
more people there are around that Jose knows  

498
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,000
and trusts, the more likely we 
are to talk him off the roof.  

499
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,520
Just keep your distance from him 
until he's ready to speak to you."

500
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:47,120
"Jose knows us as Nat and Stella. Are 
there any other officers up here?" I asked.

501
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:54,400
"No. I tried to get more in position, but 
Jose noticed them and started to panic.  

502
00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:01,760
So I insisted on just one officer, 
and here I am," Valdez explained.

503
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:10,160
In situations like this, you never know whether 
a suicide threat is a desperate call for help,  

504
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:15,840
or if it's the real thing. It's a 
situation where nobody can take chances.  

505
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:24,800
The consequences could be disastrous. Detective 
Valdez continued with the routine that has saved  

506
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:31,520
countless lives in this city. The technique 
was to establish a relationship and gain trust.

507
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,400
"Jose, you know who I am now. 
I just want to talk," she said.

508
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:47,920
No response from Jose. He put the blanket over 
his head, so his face was hidden from view.

509
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:54,080
"I just want to know if you're listening. Raise 
a hand if you're listening to me," she asked.

510
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:04,240
Jose briefly raised his right hand. She continued 
in the same smooth, calm voice. "I've got some  

511
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:11,440
friends of yours here, Stella and Nat. They're 
worried about you. Do you want to speak to them?"

512
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,920
Again, no response.

513
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,080
Detective Valdez didn't give up.  

514
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:25,360
"Jose, just listen. You know these 
people. They're trying to help you."

515
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:36,160
Valdez tried patiently again and again. At last 
a reaction from Jose. He pulled the blanket off,  

516
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:43,840
swung his leg back from the edge, and stood 
up. All he was wearing underneath was a green  

517
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:49,840
surgical gown from the hospital operating 
room. The poor guy must have been freezing.

518
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:57,840
"What can you do to help me?" shouted Jose. 
"I got a murder charge hanging over me.  

519
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:06,880
What do I have to live for?... My head... 
I got this pain... It won't go away."

520
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,320
"Speak to him, Nat," whispered Valdez.

521
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:21,440
I stood up, trying not to look down at the drop 
below. "Jose, we've got new evidence. I can prove  

522
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:28,160
you didn't do it." That wasn't strictly true, but 
it might encourage him to come down from the roof.

523
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:35,200
"Then how come they've charged me with 
murder? How come?" protested Jose.

524
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:43,120
He threw the blanket over the edge. There 
was a sudden shock of panic below until it  

525
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:47,760
became obvious that it was the blanket 
rather than Jose that was falling.  

526
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:55,920
Then he sat on the wall, with his head 
down. Again, he swung one leg over the edge.

527
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,840
"What do you think?" I whispered to Valdez.

528
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:07,840
"Not good, but not a disaster, I'd like 
Stella to talk to him now," she said.

529
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:15,200
Stella's voice was cracking with emotion 
as she spoke. "Jose? Listen to me.  

530
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:23,680
I know you didn't do it. You're not a killer. 
Something happened to you after you left that bar  

531
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:30,160
and Nat's going to prove it. We'll get 
you off this murder charge, I promise."

532
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:38,160
Silence. Stella appealed to him 
again. Jose responded at last.  

533
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:45,120
"What do you have to promise with?" 
Now there was a change in his behavior.  

534
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:55,440
Words were coming slowly as if speech involved a 
major physical and mental effort. "I... don't...  

535
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:04,000
know... I'm... finished... My head..."

536
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,080
"What's happening?" asked Stella.

537
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:13,040
"I think he's going to jump," Valdez whispered. 
"But I don't want to frighten him with any  

538
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:20,320
sudden movements. Nat, get ready to grab 
him, but don't move until I say 'Now'."

539
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:28,640
Jose's body began to tremble violently. He 
began to rock his body from side to side.

540
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:35,280
"I'm... a... no... good... 
failure..." he muttered.

541
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:41,440
"Get ready, Nat," whispered 
Valdez. "Start moving in on him."

542
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:50,080
Jose continued muttering to himself, with his 
head lowered. Sometimes what he said made sense,  

543
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:57,840
sometimes it was just a confused string of 
words. I crept along the roof towards him.

544
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,920
"I'm... a... no... good... fail..."

545
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:12,400
As Jose's voice trailed off into silence, the 
sideways rocking motion continued. With each  

546
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:20,560
swing, the top part of his body hung for a moment 
over the vertical drop. Then the return swing.

547
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:27,840
Behind me, Valdez shouted 
urgently: "This is it. NOW!"

548
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:34,160
Jose had reached the furthest point of 
the swing. But this time he didn't return.  

549
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:44,560
He was slipping off the edge. I made a dive for 
his foot and just managed to grab it. Jose was now  

550
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:51,200
hanging upside down over the edge. 
I was also hanging over the edge,  

551
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,640
with only my knees pressed against the 
wall preventing me from following Jose.  

552
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:05,840
Stella and Valdez were already hanging on to me, 
but in that position, no one else could reach Jose  

553
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:14,720
from the roof. Jose was not light and I could 
feel my grip slipping. Valdez was screaming to  

554
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:20,720
the firefighters below: "Move it! Get that 
ladder up here before we have a fatality!"

555
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:27,600
I concentrated all my efforts on 
keeping my arm locked around his foot.  

556
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:38,080
Jose swung in space over the drop. I could feel 
my muscles aching and weakening. Then out of the  

557
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:45,200
corner of my eye, I noticed the ladder swinging 
round. At the top of the ladder, there was a  

558
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:52,720
firefighter, who took Jose's unconscious body into 
his powerful arms and swung him over his shoulder.  

559
01:01:54,080 --> 01:02:00,400
As Jose was brought down to safety, a medical team 
on the ground was waiting to take him straight to  

560
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:07,600
the operating room. I pushed myself back from the 
edge and collapsed behind the safety of the wall.

561
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,400
I opened my eyes to see Stella kneeling beside me.  

562
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:18,160
"Nat, are you OK?" she 
asked. "You were wonderful!"

563
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:26,960
"Thanks. I'm alright. Just let me lie here. I 
don't want to see that drop again just yet."  

564
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,240
I lay there for a while, 
thinking it was good to be alive,  

565
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,480
after all. I'd had quite 
enough excitement for one day.

566
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,040
"Nat, you're a hero," said Valdez.

567
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:49,280
"Well, if I'm a hero, so are you. You read 
all the signs that he was going to jump.  

568
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,400
Anyway, let's get down to the operating 
room and see what's happening."

569
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,320
We were informed that Dr. Ericson 
was already operating on Jose.  

570
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:08,240
The brain surgery was a delicate procedure 
which would take hours. There was also a high  

571
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:16,320
element of risk. Jose had already put himself 
in danger by escaping from the operating room.  

572
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,680
The added stress could only 
have done further damage.  

573
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:28,640
Stella decided to stay at the hospital and wait 
for news. As I left, she was calling her mother.  

574
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:37,200
A better option for me was home, 
food, beer, TV, and relaxation.
 
 

575
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,520
CHAPTER SIX

576
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,840
The Odessa Steps

577
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:54,320
Monday morning, back at the office on East 43rd 
Street. I was going to be all alone. Stella had  

578
01:03:54,320 --> 01:04:00,240
stayed overnight at Metropolitan Hospital. 
Her brother had come out of surgery but was  

579
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:06,720
still unconscious. It was still too early to 
tell whether the surgery had been a success.

580
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:13,920
I was now convinced that someone wanted 
a convenient fall guy to take the blame  

581
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:21,200
for Romanov's murder. Maybe Jose had simply 
been unfortunate enough to be in the wrong  

582
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:27,840
place at the wrong time. Just a harmless guy 
enjoying an evening out with his buddies.  

583
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:35,520
Now he was facing a murder charge. The 
problem was our total lack of evidence.  

584
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:42,720
The whole thing made me angry. But I couldn't 
allow that anger to affect my judgment.

585
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:50,160
Meanwhile, I'd done a little research on the 
cross that Edie Tilden had seen on the body on  

586
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:57,200
Jones Beach. It was definitely Russian - the 
design used in the Russian Orthodox Church.  

587
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,240
It was likely that the letters on 
the lifeboat were also Russian.

588
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:11,040
I now had photographs of Jose, Miguel, and 
Carlos. I'd phoned all the bars in the area  

589
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:16,880
and had finally discovered one run by a 
baseball enthusiast - the Odessa Steps.  

590
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,600
I decided it was time to take a trip to Brighton 
Beach and follow the movements of the three  

591
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:29,680
friends on Wednesday night. There was a small 
chance I'd pick up a few pieces of evidence.

592
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,040
As I was getting ready to leave, 
I had a surprise phone call.  

593
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:39,840
Edie Tilden, the elderly 
woman I'd met at Jones Beach.

594
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:46,160
"Mr. Marley? Edie Tilden. Remember me?" she asked.

595
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,240
"It's kind of hard to forget you," I replied.

596
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,000
"You're not going to believe this,  

597
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,760
but I found two more bodies on the 
beach. Cold and stiff, they were!"

598
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,040
I gripped the phone tightly. 
"Now don't get over-excited.  

599
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,360
Just describe what you saw. Don't dramatize."

600
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:16,320
"Well, it was early this morning. I was 
out to see what the morning high tide  

601
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:22,400
had washed up along the shore. 
And then I found them. Two more  

602
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:28,480
young men. About five-hundred yards east 
from where the boat was wrecked," said Edie.

603
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:35,920
Edie went on to describe them. The two young 
men could have been anywhere in their twenties.  

604
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,760
Like the other two bodies, they were very thin.  

605
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:47,840
They were wearing cheap casual clothes: jeans, 
denim jackets, T-shirts, and running shoes.  

606
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,160
Clothes worn by young men everywhere; 
nothing specific to go on here.

607
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:01,520
"Did you notice any jewelry or 
identifying marks? Like scars?" I asked.

608
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,200
"No, nothing like that," she said.

609
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,880
"Thanks Edie. That's good work. 
You should have been a detective.  

610
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:17,200
Keep on with the beachcombing. Call me anytime 
you see something suspicious, will you?"

611
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:27,840
I was very curious. A murder in Coney Island, 
and now four bodies washed up on Jones Beach.  

612
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,520
Romanov was a respected member of 
the Russian community. And it looked  

613
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:40,400
like the four dead men found on Jones Beach 
were also Russian. Was there a connection?

614
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:48,160
I was wondering how those boys had died. 
Drowned accidentally in a storm or what?  

615
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,840
I called the Coast Guard press officer, 
who had prepared a news release.  

616
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:01,680
He promised to email it to me immediately. As 
I put the phone down, the email came through.
 
 

617
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,680
U.S. Coast Guard Group Moriches

618
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,120
Press Release

619
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,480
Incident at Jones Beach, Long Island

620
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:16,320
The Coast Guard Service is currently 
investigating the wreck of a lifeboat  

621
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:21,760
discovered on Jones Beach and also 
the discovery of four bodies nearby.  

622
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,600
The victims are white, male, and 
aged between twenty and thirty.

623
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:33,040
The wreck is being investigated as 
suspicious for the following reasons:

624
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,400
No boats have been reported missing.

625
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,240
No person has been reported missing at sea.

626
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,000
The boat was not in seaworthy condition.

627
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:48,400
No registration details 
are available for the boat.

628
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:54,480
If you have any information that would 
be of assistance to the U.S. Coast Guard,  

629
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:02,640
please contact Commander J. Lockhart, U.S. Coast 
Guard Station Moriches, Long Island, New York.

630
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:11,840
I printed out the email and put it aside to read 
again later. It was time to go Brighton Beach  

631
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,440
and pay a visit to the bar 
where Jose had fallen asleep.  

632
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:23,280
I took an express Q train from the 42nd Street 
subway station. As the train made its way through  

633
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:30,160
the suburbs of Brooklyn, I glanced through the 
Daily News. Nothing more on the Romanov story.

634
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:37,520
I got out at the Brighton Beach subway station 
and started working my way along the avenue,  

635
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,480
inquiring at bars whether Jose and his 
buddies might have been drinking there.  

636
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:50,160
It was just before noon so the bars were 
still quiet. A couple of bartenders vaguely  

637
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:54,720
recognized the photographs but couldn't 
provide me with anything useful.

638
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:03,760
I finally arrived at the Odessa Steps. Inside, 
the walls were covered with baseball souvenirs:  

639
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:10,560
picture after picture of the famous Brooklyn 
Dodgers teams who dominated the American  

640
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:18,560
baseball scene in the 1940s and 50s. I ordered 
a beer and sat down to take in the atmosphere.  

641
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:25,280
The lunchtime crowd was arriving and the bar 
was becoming noisy with Russian conversation.  

642
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:32,800
At the next table, one of the staff had a 
collection of tools on the table and also,  

643
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,240
a beautiful antique baseball bat. He 
was preparing to put it on the wall.

644
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:45,440
"Excuse me," I said. "I'm interested 
in the bat. I bet it has a history.  

645
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,040
Something new for the baseball exhibition, huh?"

646
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:57,920
"This bat, mister, was used in the 
final game of the 1955 World Series,"  

647
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:03,920
proudly replied the bartender, "when the 
Brooklyn Dodgers beat the New York Yankees.  

648
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:09,040
It's my boss's favorite piece. 
He paid a fortune for it."

649
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:13,520
"At today's prices, I'm sure he did," I said.

650
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:20,400
"Well, that was back in the 1980s, 
so it isn't a new piece. We've had  

651
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:25,760
it up here in the bar for years. 
You're not going to believe this,  

652
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:31,440
but Wednesday night last week, 
some joker pulled it off the wall."

653
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:40,080
"No kidding! Whoever it was would've been 
lucky to get out of here alive," I commented.

654
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,920
"I guess so," he said.

655
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:48,960
I showed him my investigator's license, and 
also the photos of Jose and his buddies.

656
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:54,800
"Did you happen to see these three 
guys in here on Wednesday?" I asked.

657
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:02,160
He immediately pointed at Jose's picture. 
"Hey, that's the guy who grabbed the bat!"

658
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,400
"What time was this?"

659
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:12,880
"Had to be nine o'clock. I remember because it 
was just before my break," the bartender replied.

660
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,440
"What happened to this guy 
after he tried to take the bat?"

661
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:26,800
So far the bartender had been talkative. Now he 
looked nervous and started to hesitate. "Er...  

662
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:35,840
I must have been on my break. Look, why don't you 
ask my colleague behind the bar. He'll remember."

663
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:44,400
The conversation with the other bartender followed 
the same pattern. His memory was perfectly clear  

664
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,360
up to the point when Jose took the bat.  

665
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:55,840
Mysteriously, they both suffered from total memory 
loss after that. Were they hiding something?  

666
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:04,480
Or were they scared of something? I was certain 
about one thing. If a stranger walked into this  

667
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:11,200
bar and attempted to steal one of their sports 
treasures, they'd be lucky to get away unharmed.  

668
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:17,840
Was it possible Jose received those 
throat and head injuries in the bar?

669
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:23,760
I didn't think I was going to find out anything 
more, but at least I had made some progress.  

670
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:32,240
Jose and his buddies had definitely 
been in the bar. I had a time, 9:00 PM,  

671
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:40,560
when Jose must have woken up, and in his confused 
state made a grab for the bat. But why wouldn't  

672
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:48,160
the bartenders reveal anything more? I stayed 
at the bar and ordered a roast beef sandwich  

673
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:55,280
and fries. While I was waiting for the food, I 
made a call to Stella at Metropolitan hospital.  

674
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:03,280
Jose was still in intensive care, slipping 
into a coma, a state of deep unconsciousness.

675
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:11,360
"Nat," said Stella. "My mom's going to take 
over for me at the hospital. I'll be going  

676
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:18,640
home soon to get some sleep. I'm just exhausted. 
But I'll be at the office first thing tomorrow."

677
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,080
"You know you don't have to if you 
want to keep your mom company," I said.

678
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:32,080
"Nat, I'm depending on you to clear Jose's name 
and prove his innocence. Let's get on with this  

679
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,080
investigation. I'm going to 
be right there with you."
 
 

680
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,400
CHAPTER SEVEN

681
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:41,840
Evidence

682
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:51,360
Early Tuesday morning, on Main Street in Queens, 
the weather was just awful. It was pouring,  

683
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:59,200
with fat raindrops bouncing off the sidewalks. Car 
headlights were reflecting off the road surface,  

684
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:07,200
in places now inches deep in water. 
I splashed along the sidewalk. My hat  

685
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:11,440
and coat were soaking wet by the 
time I got to the subway station.

686
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:19,760
At East 43rd Street, it all seemed like a 
normal day. Stella was already at her desk  

687
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:26,000
going through the morning mail. She 
gave me her usual bright 'Hi, Nat.'  

688
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:34,640
But underneath that cheerful exterior, I knew 
she was deeply worried. As soon as I'd woken up,  

689
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:42,480
I'd phoned the hospital to get an update on 
Jose's condition. I was simply told: 'No change'.

690
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:51,280
The investigation into Jose's evening at Brighton 
Beach had made little progress. I'd also had a  

691
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:58,480
call from Lena Rosenthal. Oldenberg had given 
all the relevant police information to Lena,  

692
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:03,200
our lawyer. This included the 
autopsy report on Romanov.  

693
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,080
We had arranged a midmorning 
meeting at East 43rd Street.

694
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:16,160
Over breakfast, I did some thinking. I 
recalled the basic points of police procedure  

695
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,840
which I'd been taught years 
ago at the NYPD Academy.  

696
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:31,120
In every investigation, always establish M.O.M., 
which stands for 'Motive, Opportunity, and Means.'  

697
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:41,040
Motive - why did the suspect commit the crime? 
Opportunity - did the suspect have the chance to  

698
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:49,520
carry out the crime? Means - did the suspect 
have the weapon to carry out the crime? But  

699
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:56,480
when you applied this system to Jose nothing 
seemed to make sense. There's nothing out of  

700
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:03,760
the ordinary in a guy having too many drinks 
and waking up in a strange bar. But how and  

701
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:10,640
why could he suddenly come into the possession 
of a handgun, steal a car, and commit murder?

702
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:18,320
Later that morning, Lena was going through some of 
the details of Romanov's autopsy report with me.

703
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:28,240
"What worries me Nat, is timing," she began. "We 
know that Jose probably left the Odessa Steps  

704
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:32,720
at or around nine o'clock. 
According to this report,  

705
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:40,160
Romanov's time of death was somewhere 
between 8:45 and 9:45 the same evening.  

706
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:46,960
Now, for a drunk who'd just woken up, Jose 
would have to have been one fast mover."

707
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,600
"Agreed," I said.

708
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:58,560
"There's absolutely nothing to show how or where 
he came across Romanov," Lena continued. "Did  

709
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:06,240
he just walk out into the street, wave a car to 
stop, and then rob and brutally murder the driver?  

710
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:13,600
As I see it, there's no logic here. No 
supporting evidence apart from the forensics."

711
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,320
"Anything more in the reports?"

712
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:24,480
"Cause of death, a gunshot to the head at 
close range. Romanov was on the ground when  

713
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:31,280
he was killed. According to the report, 
there was bruising on his upper arms  

714
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:37,120
which could indicate the killer was standing 
on his arms when the fatal shot was fired."

715
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,480
Stella, who had been making some 
notes, suddenly interrupted.

716
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:50,080
"Ms. Rosenthal, I need to get something clear. The 
fingerprints that were found on the gun barrel.  

717
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,840
Right-hand or left-hand prints?"

718
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,320
"All right-hand prints, according 
to the report," Lena replied.

719
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:03,120
Stella said nothing but just 
looked down at the notepad.

720
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,840
"Stella, is Jose right-handed?" I asked.

721
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,000
Stella nodded. Another setback.  

722
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:19,600
If only Jose was lefthanded. Another 
possible line of investigation closed.

723
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:26,640
Oldenberg had not followed official 
procedure after Dr. Ericson had reported  

724
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:33,280
the bruises on Jose's neck. With some 
minor blackmail, I could ask a favor.  

725
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:40,800
I thought I might have a talk with Oldenberg. 
I knew a subject that would hold his attention:  

726
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:47,200
baseball. His mind is an 
encyclopedia of baseball history.

727
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:54,960
"Oldenberg? It's Marley. Just called 
to tell you I've been admiring a bat  

728
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:01,120
used by the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 
final game of the 1955 World Series."

729
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:08,640
There was a low whistle of surprise from 
Oldenberg. I knew I had his full attention.

730
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:16,320
"It's a valuable piece of baseball history," I 
continued, "and you can see it for yourself at the  

731
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:24,400
Odessa Steps bar on Brighton Beach. They've got a 
whole museum of baseball stuff around the walls.  

732
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,400
But last Wednesday night, some 
guy pulled this bat off the wall."

733
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,760
"Hey, that would be terrible. 
That guy would be lucky to..."

734
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:42,800
"Get out of the place in one piece?" I suggested. 
"That's what people at the bar told me.  

735
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:52,480
And the guy is the accused, Jose De La Cruz. 
But he got out of the bar somehow. And then  

736
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:59,120
look what happened to him. Kind of strange, 
don't you think? Especially when the bar  

737
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:05,200
staff went suspiciously quiet when I asked 
what happened after Jose grabbed the bat."

738
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:11,760
"I don't know what to say, Marley. This 
information might have an effect on the case."

739
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:21,120
"Think about it. Now," I continued, "it's come to 
my attention that medical staff at Metropolitan  

740
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:26,080
reported bruising on De La Cruz's neck, 
which couldn't have been the result of  

741
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:31,760
the car crash. But you didn't order 
a medical examination of my client."

742
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,920
"How did you know about that?" demanded Oldenberg.

743
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:43,760
"Just doing my job," I replied calmly. 
"I have my contacts. I'm prepared to  

744
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:49,440
ignore this failure to follow official 
procedure if you do me a little favor.  

745
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:57,040
I need an official introduction from the 
NYPD to Lockhart, Commander of the Coast  

746
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:01,440
Guard Group in Moriches. That's 
the Long Island South section."

747
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,720
"What's this all about, Marley?"

748
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,840
"Let's just say another line of inquiry."

749
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:17,280
One o'clock. It had been a busy morning 
and I could hear a cold beer calling my  

750
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:23,840
name from McFadden's Bar. McFadden's Bar is 
just a block across town from the office,  

751
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:29,280
on Second Avenue, a favorite watering 
hole for New York journalists.  

752
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:38,080
I phoned the bar to check whether Ed Winchester 
was there. Ed's an old friend and a wonderful  

753
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:44,160
source of information. He'd been chief 
crime reporter for the Daily News for years,  

754
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:52,000
and still did some part-time work for the 
paper, though he was now officially retired.

755
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,400
No sooner had I entered the bar 
than I heard my name being called.  

756
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:05,920
A tall elderly guy with silver hair and a 
deeply-lined face was waving an empty glass at me.

757
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,960
"Nat, perfect timing!" Ed said.

758
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,600
"That must mean your glass 
needs refilling," I replied.

759
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:22,000
I took the beers over to an empty table and went 
though all the recent events with Ed: Romanov's  

760
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:29,760
death, Jose's night out at Brighton Beach, the 
wrecked lifeboat, and the bodies on Jones Beach.

761
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:37,840
"You see, Ed, there seem to be Russian 
connections everywhere. I was just curious  

762
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,080
whether you'd heard anything about 
crime among the Russian community."

763
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:50,560
"Money laundering is the big one," he replied. 
"In international terms, the Russian ruble is  

764
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:57,920
seen as little more than toy money. So much of the 
real business of crime is done in hard currency,  

765
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:04,240
in U.S. dollars. A lot of illegal 
dollars from that black economy are  

766
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:11,600
probably coming in to the U.S.A. from Russia. 
The problem then is how to integrate that money  

767
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,840
into the legal economy here 
without attracting attention."

768
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,400
I'd heard about money laundering. Anybody running  

769
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:26,960
organized crime operations like drugs or 
illegal gambling receives huge amounts of cash.  

770
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:34,240
Thus the need for your friendly neighborhood 
money launderer to clean the dirty money  

771
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:40,240
by transferring it through a network of bank 
accounts until nobody can find where it came from.  

772
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:47,040
Once it reappears at the other end of 
the process, the money's clean and legal.

773
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:54,160
Ed called the crime desk to see if they knew 
of any money laundering activity in the Russian  

774
01:24:54,160 --> 01:25:00,960
community. He listened carefully for a couple of 
minutes, then turned to me with a broad smile.

775
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:10,000
"There's a guy by the name of Victor Kamenev" he 
said. "It seems he was depositing regular amounts  

776
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:17,360
of cash, up to ten thousand dollars at a time, 
in a variety of banks around lower Manhattan.  

777
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:24,800
He's got a business - Kamenev Finance. Of 
course, there was the usual gossip at the  

778
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:31,840
crime desk as to whether he was laundering money 
for the Russian Mafia but no concrete evidence."

779
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:41,360
Ed had delivered the goods again, and cheap 
at the price of a beer. Another Russian name -  

780
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:47,600
but was there any possible connection between 
Romanov's death and the wreck on Jones Beach?  

781
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:54,560
I walked across town to First Avenue and 
wandered through the United Nations Plaza  

782
01:25:54,560 --> 01:26:01,440
over to the East River. Walking time is 
thinking time so I just ignored the rain.  

783
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:10,160
I needed a way to gain access to the Russian 
community. Alexei Romanov's widow could be our  

784
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:17,280
entry key. But under the circumstances, we might 
have to be a little economical with the truth.

785
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:24,640
The initial approach to Mrs. Romanov 
would need tact and sensitivity - more  

786
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:31,520
Stella's specialty than mine. Back at the 
office, after describing the plan to Stella,  

787
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:39,040
she made that all-important call. Her 
telephone manner was, as always, perfect.

788
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:46,160
"Mrs. Romanov? I'm very sorry to 
disturb you at this extremely sad time.  

789
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:52,080
I'm Stella Delgado. My employer, Mr. Nat Marley,  

790
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:56,960
is investigating a matter which is of 
deep concern to the Russian community..."

791
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:04,400
After Stella had completed the call, we had 
an appointment for the following afternoon.
 
 

792
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:08,880
CHAPTER EIGHT

793
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:10,800
Mrs. Romanov

794
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:18,080
It was one of those March mornings when 
the weather still hadn't made up its mind  

795
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:25,520
if it's the depth of winter or the beginning of 
spring. An icy wind was cutting across Manhattan.  

796
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:30,000
A few snowflakes were falling 
from the heavy, gray clouds.  

797
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:36,800
I'd arranged to meet Stella at Metropolitan 
Hospital, where she'd been at Jose's bedside  

798
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:43,120
with her mom. Stella was waiting outside 
the main entrance, shivering with cold.

799
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,760
"You'll catch your death of 
cold out here, Stella," I said.

800
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:53,680
"I prefer it out here. Right now 
I've had enough of hospitals.  

801
01:27:54,560 --> 01:28:03,120
I've just been with Jose for an hour. There's 
no change. Still in a deep coma. Just the same  

802
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:09,840
as before. At least the police are being more 
relaxed about access now that he's unconscious."

803
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:14,560
"I'd like to see him anyway 
now that I'm here," I said.

804
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:23,280
We made our way up to Jose's room. As usual, 
the police guard was on duty outside the room.  

805
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:30,240
Through the window, I could see Stella's mom at 
the bedside, talking to the unconscious Jose.

806
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:38,400
"See that, Nat? Mom spends hour after 
hour chatting to him. She's convinced  

807
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:43,200
she's getting through to him. But I 
haven't noticed any kind of response."

808
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,800
"Let's hope it does some good," I said.

809
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:52,880
I didn't feel it was appropriate 
to enter the room. Jose was with  

810
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:58,800
his family. I knew that the unconscious 
brain can still be active and functioning.  

811
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,240
I just hoped he was receiving something,  

812
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:08,400
something that might get though whatever block 
was keeping him from regaining consciousness.

813
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:15,680
Yesterday, Oldenberg had emailed me a 
letter of introduction to a Commander  

814
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:20,880
Lockhart of the U.S. Coast Guard, who was 
based at the Moriches Coast Guard Station.  

815
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,320
I'd already made an appointment to talk 
to him about the Jones Beach wreck.  

816
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:33,760
The wrecked lifeboat was now being stored at 
Jones Beach Coast Guard Station, and I had  

817
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:41,840
arranged to meet Lockhart there. I was curious to 
examine it and prove any new Russian connections.  

818
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:50,160
As far as this investigation was concerned, 
it was all a very long shot. It could easily  

819
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:55,440
be a pointless visit. But I felt we 
should be doing something for Jose.

820
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:04,960
The subway was clear of the worst of the rush hour 
crowds. As the number four train sped downtown  

821
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:11,280
toward midtown Manhattan, I thought over what I 
knew about Jose's night out in Brighton Beach.  

822
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:17,680
If only he would regain consciousness, 
then he might recall something relevant.

823
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:24,800
From 51st Street, an E train took 
us west across town to Penn Station,  

824
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:32,640
where we took a Long Island Rail Road train to 
Freeport. A forty-minute journey, but quicker and  

825
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:40,960
cheaper than any cab. As the train made its way 
through the suburbs of Queens, I noticed Stella  

826
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:47,840
biting her lip. I know that little habit 
of hers; it means something is on her mind.

827
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,680
"Are you OK, Stella?" I asked.

828
01:30:52,640 --> 01:31:01,360
"This past week, Nat, has been a total nightmare. 
I'm tense and anxious all the time. We seem to  

829
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:08,400
be getting nowhere fast. I know it's not your 
fault, you're doing everything you possibly can,  

830
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:14,240
but there are times when I feel like 
tearing my hair out and screaming."

831
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:23,920
"Don't give up hope, Stella," I said. "I won't let 
Jose down, believe me. I'm positive the evidence  

832
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:31,760
is out there. The pressure's getting me down too. 
If this was an ordinary, everyday investigation,  

833
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:39,200
I'd be able to walk away from it and put it right 
out of my mind. But it's there with me all the  

834
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:47,200
time. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I'm 
thinking about it. We'll crack this case somehow."

835
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:53,200
We took a cab from Freeport to the 
Jones Beach Coast Guard Station,  

836
01:31:53,840 --> 01:32:00,400
where we were welcomed by the officer responsible 
for Long Island South, Commander Lockhart,  

837
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,440
a tall, fit-looking man in his fifties.

838
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:10,080
"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Marley," said 
Lockhart, shaking my hand with a firm grip.  

839
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:15,040
"Captain Oldenberg asked me to give 
you every possible assistance."

840
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:23,440
"Thanks," I said. "This is my assistant, 
Stella Delgado. We're working on a case  

841
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:27,760
that just might have a connection with 
the recent incident on Jones Beach.  

842
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:34,240
As you know, we'd like to see that wrecked 
lifeboat which was recovered," I replied.

843
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:41,760
Lockhart took us out to a workshop 
alongside the Coast Guard building. Inside  

844
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:48,320
was part of what had once been a well-built 
boat. The paint was peeling off it.  

845
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:53,840
Some clean fresh wood was visible 
where the boat had split in two.  

846
01:32:55,040 --> 01:33:00,960
At the back of the boat were the faded 
letters. They did look like Russian letters.

847
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:07,840
Lockhart took a screwdriver from a workbench 
and pointed at a section of the boat.

848
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:14,960
"I'd like to demonstrate to you just how poor 
the condition of this boat is," he announced.

849
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,280
He drove the blade of the 
screwdriver into the wood.  

850
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:25,200
It went through with little effort. 
The wood was completely rotten.

851
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:33,680
Stella gasped. "Those poor guys!" she 
exclaimed. "They wouldn't have had a chance."

852
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:38,560
"This boat was no more than a floating grave,"  

853
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:42,480
Lockhart continued. "It's 
completely falling apart."

854
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,760
"What about the four guys who were 
found on Jones Beach?" I asked.

855
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,760
"I have the full autopsy details in my  

856
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,840
office. Shall we go there and 
I'll show you?" he suggested.

857
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:01,600
Inside his office, Lockhart sorted 
through a pile of documents.

858
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:10,080
"Here we are. Cause of death: exposure and 
drowning. They must have floated for as  

859
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:14,480
long as they could. Maybe holding 
on to what was left of the boat.  

860
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:21,040
But the chance of survival in those temperatures 
would have been very slight," he said.

861
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:26,400
"Was there any form of identification 
on the bodies?" asked Stella.

862
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:33,360
"All that was found were some Russian labels 
on their clothes, and a Russian Orthodox cross.  

863
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,040
But otherwise, we've no identification.  

864
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,720
We're running a check with the Russian 
authorities, but these things take time."

865
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:49,280
"Off the record, what do you think 
really happened to these guys?" I asked.

866
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:58,880
"Our guess is an illegal immigration operation," 
Lockhart began. "They probably paid a huge amount  

867
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:06,640
of money for the privilege of being smuggled 
from Russia into the U.S.A. In cases like these,  

868
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:13,840
another bigger boat would be involved, probably 
a small fishing boat. They remain offshore,  

869
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:17,440
then transfer the immigrants into smaller boats."

870
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:24,160
"Are you talking about occasional incidents 
or regular shipments of immigrants?" I asked.

871
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:32,400
"We suspect regular traffic. We've had a 
number of reports of suspicious activity from  

872
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:38,880
routine Coast Guard patrols. The Coast Guard 
has carried out a number of search and seizure  

873
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:45,680
operations at sea, but our resources are 
limited. For every illegal immigrant we  

874
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:53,200
seize, there could be others slipping through the 
net. Of course, we question the ones we catch,  

875
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:59,440
but never learn anything really useful, like 
names of the people behind the operation."

876
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:10,080
"Thanks," I said. "This has been very useful. If 
I discover anything relevant, I'll let you know."

877
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:17,040
"Mr. Marley, whoever put any people into 
that boat might as well have been holding a  

878
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:23,840
gun to their heads," said Lockhart. "You 
realize there could still be more bodies?  

879
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:27,840
It could take time before they're 
all washed onto the beach."

880
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:35,680
From Jones Beach, we took a cab to Brighton 
Beach. The heavy clouds had begun to lift  

881
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:39,520
slightly and the occasional ray 
of sunshine was breaking through.  

882
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:47,120
Our next appointment - with Alexei Romanov's 
widow - had to be handled very delicately.

883
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:52,960
The Romanov house was situated in a 
wealthy neighborhood of Brighton Beach,  

884
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:58,080
off Shore Boulevard. Large houses with well-cared  

885
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:03,440
for gardens. None of the trees had 
been optimistic enough to think about  

886
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:08,800
bursting into leaf yet. The temperature 
couldn't have been much above freezing.  

887
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:16,320
The door was answered by a maid who took our 
names and left us waiting in the entrance hall.

888
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:23,120
Soon, she returned and led us into 
an elegantly furnished dining room.  

889
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:33,600
Mrs. Romanov then entered - a tall gray-haired 
woman wearing a black dress with a simple gold pin  

890
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:40,480
fastened at her throat. In her face, you could see 
the grief that she must have been going through.

891
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:47,840
"Ms. Delgado and Mr. Marley. 
Welcome. Do sit down," she said.

892
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:54,960
"We realize that this is not an appropriate 
time to visit," began Stella. "We're aware  

893
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,440
of the good work your late husband did 
with newly arrived Russian immigrants,  

894
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,960
and we'd like to offer our deepest sympathies."

895
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:07,200
"Thank you. You're most kind," she said.

896
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:13,600
"Our visit concerns Russian immigrants 
who may have been attempting to enter  

897
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:20,480
the country illegally. You may have heard about 
the bodies found on Jones Beach?" asked Stella.

898
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,280
Mrs. Romanov nodded.

899
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:30,960
"They were probably young Russian men," Stella 
continued. "The boat they were sailing in  

900
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:38,480
was in a completely unseaworthy condition. Whoever 
was behind this immigrant smuggling operation  

901
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:41,200
had surely sent these boys to their deaths."

902
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:49,680
Mrs. Romanov frowned. I could see we had 
her attention. "But this is dreadful!  

903
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,760
Can I be of any assistance?" asked Mrs. Romanov.  

904
01:38:54,880 --> 01:39:01,360
"Poor Alexei would have moved heaven and earth 
to bring the people responsible to justice."

905
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,680
I judged it was the right time to make my move.

906
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:11,600
"I realize that this is not a suitable 
time to ask this question, ma'am,"  

907
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:16,720
I said. "We know your husband was active 
with the Immigrant Welfare Society.  

908
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:23,840
Could he possibly have made any enemies 
in the Russian community? You see, there  

909
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:30,000
could be some connection between your husband's 
death and these poor boys found on Jones beach."

910
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,880
I really couldn't be absolutely 
sure of my facts here, but again,  

911
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:42,560
there was no harm in taking a chance if we were 
going to make any progress with Jose's case.

912
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:50,800
"The police have already asked me all 
about..." began Mrs. Romanov. She then paused  

913
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:58,800
and gave me a hard stare. "I don't think you're 
being completely truthful with me, Mr. Marley.  

914
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:02,240
What is the real reason for your visit?"

915
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:07,920
It was time to put all our cards on the table.

916
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:17,280
"Mrs. Romanov, I apologize. Yes, I have been 
less than honest. I am a private investigator  

917
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:24,800
representing my client, Jose De La Cruz, who, 
as you know, has been charged with the murder  

918
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:31,840
of your late husband. I do not believe that your 
husband was the victim of a simple street crime.  

919
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:38,000
I suspect your husband had discovered 
something that put his life in danger."

920
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:44,880
Mrs. Romanov's face grew pale. 
She sat silently and still  

921
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:51,280
as I continued. "We also have to admit 
that our interest in this case is personal.  

922
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:57,040
Our client, Jose De La Cruz is 
Ms. Delgado's younger brother."

923
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:01,120
Stella turned to face Mrs. Romanov.

924
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:08,960
"Believe me, Mrs. Romanov, this is 
difficult for me too. As God is my witness,  

925
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:14,080
my brother is not a killer. 
Just a gentle, harmless,  

926
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:19,840
ordinary guy who must've been in the wrong 
place at the wrong time," said Stella.

927
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:29,920
I continued, "As far as the NYPD are concerned, 
they've found their killer, but I'm not convinced.  

928
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:34,480
I am asking for your help 
in finding your husband's  

929
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:39,840
real killer or killers. I can't 
be more honest than that."
 
 

930
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:44,160
CHAPTER NINE

931
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:48,560
Victor Kamenev

932
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:53,920
Mrs. Romanov stood up and stared out the 
window for a moment before speaking again.

933
01:41:55,200 --> 01:42:00,560
"Mr. Marley, Ms. Delgado," she 
said. "I believe you are sincere.  

934
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,080
You may count on my cooperation and support."

935
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:07,680
Stella looked at me and smiled.

936
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:14,880
Mrs. Romanov continued: "You appreciate 
this is a very difficult time for me.  

937
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:20,800
But I'll do my best. There's something 
quite weird about the events of last week.  

938
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,840
I've had this feeling that the police have not 
made every effort to investigate the case fully.  

939
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:36,960
Alexei was well respected for all his community 
work. He had a fine reputation. He made friends  

940
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:42,880
rather than enemies. I think of all the 
people he's helped to settle here and become  

941
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:49,280
good American citizens, and I'm not aware of 
anyone who could have anything against him."

942
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:57,920
"Did he ever mention any names? Any little remarks 
he made about people?" I asked. "Take your time."

943
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:05,040
"There is something. Last night, I 
was going through Alexei's wardrobe,  

944
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:12,720
seeing what I could give away to charity. In 
a jacket pocket, I found a piece of paper,  

945
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:20,240
rolled up into a ball. It was a short 
message in Russian with no date or address.  

946
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:30,240
It was a warning and just said: 'I am telling 
you this in the strictest confidence. Mossolov  

947
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:39,040
could be dangerous. You don't know what you're 
getting involved with.' It was signed 'Victor'."

948
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,560
"You still have the note?" I asked.

949
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:47,360
Mrs. Romanov opened a desk 
drawer and took out the note.

950
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,840
"Does the name 'Victor' mean 
anything to you?" I asked.

951
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,320
"No," she answered.

952
01:43:55,440 --> 01:44:02,480
"Well, it could be Victor Kamenev who runs a 
business by the name of Kamenev Finance," I said.  

953
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:09,040
"We'll have to check this out and get back to 
you. Have you informed the police about this?"

954
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:14,240
"No. There's just been so 
much on my mind..." she began.

955
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:21,040
"I'd advise you to let them have the note 
immediately, but with your permission,  

956
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:27,120
I'd rather you didn't tell the NYPD about 
Kamenev until I've checked him out first."

957
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:34,400
We left the house and made our way to the 
Brighton Beach subway and took an express  

958
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:42,160
Q train back to Manhattan. At last some pieces 
of the puzzle seemed to be falling into place,  

959
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:49,600
but we were still a long way from the 
solution. We had another Russian connection.  

960
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:58,960
I wanted to pay a surprise visit to Mr. Kamenev, 
but I needed support. We could be moving in deep,  

961
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:07,280
dangerous waters. I made a call on my cell phone 
to Joe Blaney, an ex-NYPD colleague of mine.  

962
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:15,840
Joe's also an ex-NYPD heavyweight boxing 
champion. He retired a few years ago but  

963
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:21,360
still looks impressively tough, tough 
enough to scare people into cooperating.  

964
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:28,000
That's one good reason why he accompanies me 
on any job where there's an element of risk.

965
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:34,320
"Joe, I have some work for 
you. Are you busy?" I asked.

966
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,360
"I got nothing on," said Joe.

967
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:43,840
"Meet me at McSorley's Ale House on East 
7th Street at three o'clock, this afternoon.  

968
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:46,960
I'll give you all the details then."

969
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:54,720
Stella and I transferred to an uptown train 
at Broadway and Lafayette, and got off at  

970
01:45:54,720 --> 01:46:01,440
Astor Place in the middle of the East Village. 
Joe joined us in the bar just before three.  

971
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:08,160
I gave him a brief outline of the story so 
far before we left for Kamenev's office.  

972
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:14,480
On the stairs up to the office, old 
wallpaper was peeling off the walls.  

973
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:22,800
On the upstairs landing, flattened cigarette butts 
covered the floor. "Elegant, huh?" muttered Joe.

974
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:32,320
As we entered Kamenev's office, the contrast 
couldn't have been greater. Inside, all was clean,  

975
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:40,080
neat, and tastefully decorated. The floors were 
polished wood. Everywhere was the latest in  

976
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:48,080
office technology. In response to our request to 
speak to Kamenev, the receptionist said a little  

977
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:56,000
too automatically: "You don't have an appointment. 
Sorry, but Mr. Kamenev is busy with a client."

978
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,640
There was no sound of conversation 
coming from his office.

979
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:06,640
"Seems awfully quiet in there. 
Would you tell him Nat Marley  

980
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:10,240
wants to speak to him concerning Alexei Romanov."

981
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:17,520
She gave me a sour look and picked up 
the phone. She spoke briefly to him  

982
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:25,120
and then turned to me and said, "Seems that Mr. 
Kamenev's not so busy after all. You can go in."

983
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:35,120
The guy behind the desk had to be Kamenev, a big 
man with rosy cheeks, bushy moustache, and a full  

984
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:43,120
head of curly hair. You could see his reflection 
in the polished wood of the large desk. Around  

985
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:49,840
the room were various framed photographs of life 
in the old Russia from the nineteenth century.

986
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:55,680
"Mr. Kamenev? The name's Nat Marley, 
licensed private investigator.  

987
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:03,680
This is my assistant Stella Delgado and my 
colleague Joe Blaney. I'll come straight to  

988
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:08,800
the point. I'm investigating the 
recent murder of Alexei Romanov.  

989
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:14,880
I believe you may have information concerning 
who was responsible for the killing."

990
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:21,280
"I don't know anything. Who sent you 
here?" demanded Kamenev nervously.

991
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:30,320
Kamenev suddenly opened a desk drawer and produced 
an automatic pistol. He pointed it at me with a  

992
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:38,960
trembling hand. Joe was equally quick. His old 
police special was pointing straight at Kamenev,  

993
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,600
but his hand was rock steady.

994
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:50,800
"Mr. Kamenev," said Joe smoothly, "it's obvious 
you're no gunman. Let's use some common sense.  

995
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:54,240
I suggest you put that gun down."

996
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:01,680
Kamenev sighed and placed the gun 
on the desk. Joe moved to the desk,  

997
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:06,240
and emptied the bullets out of the 
weapon, then returned it to Kamenev.

998
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:12,400
"Is it true that you sent a warning 
note to Mr. Romanov?" I asked.

999
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:17,040
Kamenev eyed us suspiciously from behind his desk.  

1000
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:23,840
"Before I say anything, I need to have a 
guarantee that you are genuine," he said.

1001
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:33,120
"By all means. I suggest you call Alexei Romanov's 
widow," I replied and gave him the number.

1002
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:41,600
A conversation in rapid Russian followed. 
After a while, he put the phone down and  

1003
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:47,760
looked at us. "My apologies. You 
understand I have to be cautious."

1004
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:55,840
I glanced around the room again. There were also 
photographs of the old Russian royal family.  

1005
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:01,040
Nicholas, the last of the 
Czars with Czarina Alexandra.

1006
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:06,480
"You obviously love your 
country. You must be a patriot.  

1007
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:14,400
Also, you must have been a friend of Alexei 
Romanov. Who were you trying to protect him from?"

1008
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:24,080
Silence. After a long pause Kamenev 
spoke: "This is very difficult for me,  

1009
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:32,640
Mr. Marley. It's really not wise to say anything 
more. If I were you I'd stay away from all this."

1010
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:41,120
Kamenev looked uncomfortable. I wondered if he 
was too scared to talk, like the bartenders at  

1011
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:49,760
the Odessa Steps? I tried a different approach. 
Kamenev's business could be benefiting from  

1012
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:57,520
the money coming in from the illegal immigrant 
operation. I had no proof, but it was worth a try.

1013
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:06,480
"I want to speak to you about some poor Russian 
boys found dead on Jones Beach. I've heard a rumor  

1014
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:12,880
that someone was laundering the money these boys 
paid to get into the country, money that needed  

1015
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:20,000
to be integrated into the legal economy. I 
understand that's your line of business."

1016
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,440
Kamenev remained silent.

1017
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:29,920
"Is money laundering part of your business?" 
I insisted. Again Kamenev didn't say anything.

1018
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:38,320
"Let's get one thing straight," I said. "I'm sure 
there's a whole lot of questions the IRS would  

1019
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:45,440
love to ask about your accounts, but I'm not 
investigating your business. Let's get back to  

1020
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:53,120
those poor young men who were washed up on Jones 
Beach. Whoever launders the money those boys paid  

1021
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:59,040
to get into the country might as well have held 
a gun to their heads and pulled the trigger.  

1022
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:06,640
Would it be you by any chance? You see, 
they died because they'd been put in a  

1023
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:15,520
boat that was falling apart. The boat split in 
two in the storm and they drowned. In some way  

1024
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:21,120
you might share some responsibility for 
the deaths of four good Russian boys."

1025
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:28,320
I could see Kamenev's lips tightening. 
I knew what I said had found its target.  

1026
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:35,760
I was appealing to his sense of honor. I hoped 
and prayed there was some honor left in him.

1027
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:44,960
"Four good Russian boys," I repeated. "All they 
wanted was to enter the land of opportunity  

1028
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:52,960
and make a success of their lives. And now 
they're dead. Their families back in Russia  

1029
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:59,040
won't know what's happened to them. Maybe they 
saved up for years to give their sons this  

1030
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:05,280
chance. But you won't be out of pocket. 
The money will still be coming in."

1031
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:14,400
"Honest to God," stammered Kamenev, "I don't ask 
questions! Their deaths couldn't be my fault."

1032
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:19,120
"So you were just the honest money launderer,  

1033
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:25,840
huh?" I asked. "No questions asked 
and nothing on your conscience?"

1034
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:30,640
Kamenev remained silent. Sweat 
started to form on his forehead.

1035
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:36,160
"I have this feeling there's a 
connection between Romanov's death  

1036
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:42,880
and those boys found drowned on Jones Beach. 
You follow what I'm saying?" I went on.

1037
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,720
He nodded, but his expression was blank.

1038
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:55,360
"I think you can help," I continued. "Help us 
find the guys who sent those good Russians to  

1039
01:53:55,360 --> 01:54:03,200
their deaths. You're a patriot, and despite your 
line of business, I believe you're a man of honor.  

1040
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:10,240
The most patriotic thing you could do 
is help us to find whoever is exploiting  

1041
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:16,880
honest Russian people. We also want to 
find who really killed Alexei Romanov.  

1042
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:23,360
That man did some fine work in the community, 
helping Russian folks to settle here."

1043
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:30,480
He remained silent. I nodded to 
Stella. "Tell him," I said to her.

1044
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:39,120
"Mr. Kamenev," Stella began, "our interest 
in this case is also personal. My brother,  

1045
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:44,320
Jose De La Cruz has been wrongly 
accused of Alexei Romanov's murder.  

1046
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:52,960
As far as the NYPD are concerned he's guilty. 
We believe he was set up as the fall guy,  

1047
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:58,320
to take the blame. We need someone 
who knows the Russian community,  

1048
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:05,840
someone who has the contacts and inside knowledge, 
to help bring the real killers to justice.

1049
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:16,160
Kamenev took a deep breath and pushed his hands 
into his fists. "OK," said Kamenev, "I admit that  

1050
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:24,960
in my work, I don't ask too many questions. 
Cash arrives from anonymous clients. I only know  

1051
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:32,400
them by a number. But if innocent Russian boys 
have been killed and I've profited from it..."

1052
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:39,360
I interrupted him. "You still haven't told 
me why you sent the warning note to Romanov.  

1053
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:41,360
Who's Mossolov?"

1054
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:46,160
"Mossolov runs some sort of 
operation in Brighton Beach  

1055
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:54,160
and contacts me from time to time to 
expect a delivery of cash. We've never met,  

1056
01:55:54,720 --> 01:56:04,640
only exchanged coded emails and faxes. Monday last 
week, Mossolov emailed me and asked what I knew  

1057
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:15,280
about Romanov. I asked why and the reply was that 
Romanov had been asking inconvenient questions. I  

1058
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:22,240
didn't want to get involved, so I just played it 
safe and denied any knowledge of Romanov, except  

1059
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:31,360
what's known publicly. I suspected that Mossolov 
was dangerous and so Romanov could be in danger."

1060
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:42,240
"Thank you, Mr. Kamenev. Our problem is that we 
still have to prove who murdered Romanov," I said.

1061
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:49,520
"Mr. Marley, I am a patriot, and I feel I 
owe a debt of honor towards my countrymen.  

1062
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:51,680
How can I help?"

1063
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:57,200
"I'm going to set up a meeting with 
Alexei Romanov's widow," I said.  

1064
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:03,920
"I'd like you to be there. Expect 
a call from me tomorrow morning.
 
 

1065
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:08,400
CHAPTER TEN

1066
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:09,840
Witness

1067
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:19,520
It was now just over a week since Alexei 
Romanov had been found murdered. People's  

1068
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:23,840
memories tend to fade once events 
become part of the distant past.  

1069
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:32,480
We needed to find witnesses while their memories 
were still fresh. Maybe the presence of Kamenev  

1070
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:37,840
would help the bartenders at the Odessa 
Steps to remember more about Wednesday night.

1071
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:47,280
I left Stella to do some phoning to set up a 
meeting with Kamenev and Mrs. Romanov. I suggested  

1072
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:53,040
somewhere like a good restaurant in the Brighton 
Beach area, but I left the choice up to her.  

1073
01:57:54,560 --> 01:58:01,200
I had received another Coast Guard press 
release. Another body washed up on Jones Beach.  

1074
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:05,840
The details were similar to 
those of the other victims:  

1075
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:11,360
a male, in his twenties. No form 
of identification on the body.  

1076
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:17,200
No definite connection could be made with 
the previous fatalities on Jones Beach.

1077
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:25,120
But if there was a connection, just how many 
people had been on board that lifeboat when it  

1078
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:32,080
left the ship for the Long Island shore? With the 
information about deaths of innocent Russian boys,  

1079
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:39,040
I didn't anticipate too much difficulty in gaining 
the cooperation of the citizens of Brighton Beach.

1080
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:44,560
I had just finished reading the 
press release when the phone rang.  

1081
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:49,760
I recognized the elegant 
English accent - Edie Tilden.

1082
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:56,800
"Mr. Marley, I've seen a very 
suspicious incident, on Fire Island."

1083
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:02,640
Had I been wise to encourage that eccentric 
old lady to play the investigator?

1084
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:06,000
"Tell me all about it," I said.

1085
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:12,480
"I spent yesterday beachcombing 
along the eastern tip of Fire Island.  

1086
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:19,600
And I saw this man who didn't look like 
he really belonged on a beach," she said.

1087
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:23,120
"What do you mean by 'didn't belong'?"

1088
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:32,000
"He wasn't dressed properly. Too formal. 
He was wearing an overcoat over a gray  

1089
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:39,200
suit. Shiny black shoes. He was looking 
out at the ocean through binoculars,  

1090
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:43,840
but I don't think he was watching the wildlife."

1091
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:46,480
"Could you describe him?" I asked.

1092
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:54,640
"Well, he was tall, six feet 
plus, with a big build. But,  

1093
01:59:54,640 --> 02:00:02,960
you see, Mr. Marley, I saw all this from a 
distance. As soon as I got closer, he left."

1094
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:07,200
Perhaps he was frightened 
by the sight of Edie Tilden.  

1095
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:15,360
What she had witnessed could be relevant or 
could have been entirely innocent. Fire Island  

1096
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:21,440
is the next narrow strip of land off the Long 
Island mainland, to the east of Jones Beach.  

1097
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:29,280
Anyway, I stored away the information, thanked 
her, and returned to our immediate concerns.

1098
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:37,680
Stella had made the necessary arrangements: a 
midday meeting at Cafe Paris in Brighton Beach.  

1099
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:45,120
A table had been booked, and Kamenev was 
on his way to pick us up. It would be a  

1100
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:50,080
pleasant change to travel to Brighton 
Beach by car instead of the subway.

1101
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:57,520
Things with Kamenev were now more relaxed, so 
we were able to get to know one another a little  

1102
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:05,440
better. Victor Kamenev's family, we learned, left 
Russia and settled in America many years ago.  

1103
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:11,600
Like many in the Russian-American 
community, Russian was his first language,  

1104
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:16,800
and he and his relatives had remained 
true to their cultural roots.

1105
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:22,320
The car was now leaving Manhattan, 
crossing the Brooklyn Bridge.  

1106
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:31,360
Below, the wind was whipping up the waters of 
the East River into white-tipped waves. Above us,  

1107
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:40,080
on the footbridge, people were walking into 
Manhattan, well wrapped-up against the cold. Soon  

1108
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:46,560
we were cruising along Flatbush Avenue, with the 
skyscrapers of Manhattan fading into the distance.

1109
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:56,400
The conversation turned to recent events. "Mr. 
Marley," Kamenev started, "I've been thinking  

1110
02:01:56,400 --> 02:02:02,640
a lot about our conversation yesterday. 
I'll ask whatever questions you want me to.  

1111
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:10,800
I can put pressure on people and ask for favors. 
There are people around Brighton Beach who owe  

1112
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:17,840
me money. The prospect of negotiating a 
debt should encourage someone to talk."

1113
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:25,360
The car was now rolling through the suburbs of 
Brooklyn. The rest of the journey passed sociably.  

1114
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:31,760
On arriving at the Cafe Paris, we 
met Mrs. Romanov, who was waiting in  

1115
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:37,760
the reception area. We were taken over to 
our table where I made the introductions.

1116
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:45,840
"Mrs. Romanov. You've already met 
Stella and this is Mr. Victor Kamenev.  

1117
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:49,840
Mr. Kamenev is as anxious as you are to get  

1118
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:55,520
justice for your husband. Mr. Kamenev sent 
the warning note to your late husband."

1119
02:02:57,120 --> 02:03:05,440
Not surprisingly, Mrs. Romanov looked extremely 
tense. After ordering, Mrs. Romanov questioned  

1120
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:14,080
Kamenev. A long conversation in Russian. To 
begin with, Mrs. Romanov's voice was sharp.  

1121
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:20,960
I held my breath and crossed my fingers, 
but soon she sounded much friendlier.  

1122
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:29,920
I breathed out. Then, they shook hands 
warmly. Mrs. Romanov addressed everybody.  

1123
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:40,320
"I'm sorry about that. I needed to be absolutely 
sure about Mr. Kamenev. Now, I feel I can trust  

1124
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:48,960
him. This is a very difficult time for me. It's 
little more than a week since poor Alexei was so  

1125
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:57,440
cruelly murdered. I want to thank you all 
very sincerely for coming here. Mr. Marley,  

1126
02:03:57,440 --> 02:04:06,240
I know you said your interest in this case was 
personal. Naturally, mine is too. I know you must  

1127
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:12,560
have other work you should be doing, and this 
investigation must be a considerable expense."

1128
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:16,560
"Well, not really, ma'am..." I began.

1129
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:21,040
"Mr. Marley, you're a very poor liar.  

1130
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:27,520
I'm hiring you to find my husband's 
murderer. Whatever the cost."

1131
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:35,920
I could certainly use the money. I hadn't done any 
other work since I'd heard the news about Jose.  

1132
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:40,960
And there was still the office 
rent, taxes, and salaries to pay.

1133
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:46,800
"Thank you, ma'am, I accept. 
Stella will draw up a contract."

1134
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:54,800
After a discussion over lunch, there seemed 
to be two clear avenues of investigation.  

1135
02:04:56,080 --> 02:05:02,800
One was the Odessa Steps. Having a member of 
the Russian community with us could help to  

1136
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:10,720
make some progress there. The other avenue was 
Alexei Romanov's computer files, particularly  

1137
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:18,800
those concerning the Immigrant Welfare Society. 
Computer skills were Stella's specialty, so she  

1138
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:25,120
left with Mrs. Romanov to examine the computer, 
while I paid a visit to the bar with Kamenev.

1139
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:33,120
When we arrived, the lunchtime crowd was 
building up. I took Victor over to the  

1140
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:39,040
display of sports souvenirs. I showed 
him the baseball bat Jose had grabbed.  

1141
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:47,600
The bat was now securely fixed to the wall 
with metal bands and strong screws. I gave  

1142
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:53,680
Kamenev all the background information he might 
need about Jose's night out in Brighton Beach.

1143
02:05:55,200 --> 02:06:02,000
I recognized the bartender I'd spoken with on 
my previous visit. He was laughing and joking  

1144
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:08,880
with the regular customers. His face dropped 
as soon as he saw me holding up Jose's picture.

1145
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:16,320
"Remember me?" I asked. "I was asking you 
about this guy who'd been drinking here  

1146
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:19,680
last Wednesday night. His name's Jose  

1147
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:26,000
and he's in a lot of trouble. I got the 
impression you were suffering from a little  

1148
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:33,680
memory loss. Or maybe you were just confused. 
I've brought a friend along to help you remember."

1149
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:40,560
The bartender stood there silently. 
Sweat started to form on his forehead.  

1150
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:45,520
He looked like a frightened 
animal, nervous and vulnerable.

1151
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:52,080
"I didn't see nothing. I swear I 
didn't see nothing," he repeated.

1152
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:59,920
Meanwhile, a smartly dressed guy, who I took 
to be the manager, joined the bartender.

1153
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:06,800
"What's going on here?" he asked. 
"I'll have no harassment of my staff."

1154
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:14,480
The moment he made eye contact with Kamenev, 
the manager froze and lowered his head.  

1155
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:24,000
Victor spoke to him in Russian. It sounded like a 
heated argument at first, but tempers soon cooled.  

1156
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:30,560
The manager waved to the bartender who 
poured drinks for Kamenev and myself.

1157
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:37,440
"Mikhail, the bar manager, has just 
remembered how much in debt he is to me.  

1158
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:43,840
I've offered to be flexible about the 
repayments, provided we get some information.  

1159
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:47,200
Shall we move into your office, Mikhail?"

1160
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:57,520
The bartender told us that Jose had woken up in 
the bar alone. He was sleepy and confused. He  

1161
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:06,240
stood up, reached out an arm, grabbed the baseball 
bat, fell over and just lay there. The regular  

1162
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:12,640
customers at the bar were very offended. 
Who was this guy damaging the sacred bat?  

1163
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:20,720
Before anyone could lay a hand on him, someone 
else had got involved and protected Jose from  

1164
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:27,760
the furious regulars. This guy had taken 
pity on him and said he'd help get him home.

1165
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:33,440
I was getting very interested indeed. There were  

1166
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:38,080
a whole lot of questions I needed 
to ask via Kamenev's interpreting.

1167
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:43,440
"The guy who helped Jose. Name?" I asked.

1168
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:49,840
The bartender paused and looked fearfully 
toward his boss, who nodded his permission.

1169
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:55,840
"He's called Nick Zernov. If 
you know what's good for you,  

1170
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:59,680
you'll stay clear of him. He's a real bad guy."

1171
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:06,400
That explained why he had the power 
to protect Jose from an angry crowd.  

1172
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:15,840
Zernov had seen the opportunity to use Jose as the 
fall guy to make Jose appear guilty for a murder.

1173
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:20,960
"Give me a full description 
of Zernov, will you," I asked.

1174
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:30,800
"Tall, over six feet, and muscular. 
Black hair cut really short. Thick black  

1175
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:39,360
eyebrows. His nose looks like someone broke it. 
Likes to wear expensive suits, shiny material."

1176
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:44,640
I experienced that thrill you get when you realize  

1177
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:48,720
some parts of the puzzle might 
at last be fitting together.  

1178
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:57,600
I recalled Edie Tilden's description of the guy 
she'd seen on Fire Island. I had to remind myself  

1179
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:05,440
not to get over-excited. We still had nothing 
concrete yet. I continued with the questioning.

1180
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:09,920
"How drunk was Jose? Could he stand up?"

1181
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:16,880
"He was a bit unsteady after Zernov 
picked him up, but otherwise OK.  

1182
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:25,680
He had a few more drinks and then Zernov took him 
outside. That's all I know," the bartender said.

1183
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:34,480
"You know this guy Jose is facing a murder 
charge. They think he killed Alexei Romanov.  

1184
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:41,840
Jose was just a harmless drunk. I don't 
believe he is the killer," I said.

1185
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:46,480
The name Romanov meant something to the bartender.  

1186
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:55,840
His face brightened. "Mr. Romanov helped 
me and my family. Such a good man."

1187
02:10:56,640 --> 02:11:03,120
I had a final question. "Would you be prepared 
to tell the police what you've just told us?"

1188
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:10,880
Another discussion in Russian between Kamenev 
and the bartender. The bartender frowned  

1189
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:16,400
and shook his head. Then he said 
something, almost in a whisper.  

1190
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:26,240
Before I got the translation, I knew it meant 
'No'. The bartender was clearly terrified.
 
 

1191
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:30,880
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1192
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:32,640
Progress

1193
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:41,680
It was time to see how Stella had been doing at 
the Romanov house with the computer files. As  

1194
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:49,760
Kamenev's car rolled along Shore Boulevard, I was 
thinking about the case. I told Kamenev my theory.

1195
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:56,080
"Victor, I think we have enough new 
information to encourage the police  

1196
02:11:56,080 --> 02:12:03,520
to follow a new line of investigation. We now 
know that Jose left the bar with a guy who has  

1197
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:09,680
local criminal connections. Zernov doesn't 
sound like the type of guy who'd rescue  

1198
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:14,960
someone from a beating purely out of warm, 
sympathetic feelings toward his fellow men.  

1199
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:22,400
So my theory is that Zernov saw an 
opportunity to use Jose as the fall guy."

1200
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:26,960
"But what about all the 
evidence against your client?  

1201
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:31,920
The forensics? And the murder 
weapon?" asked Kamenev.

1202
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:36,720
"It'd be quite easy for Zernov to kill Romanov,"  

1203
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:43,360
I explained. "Then, for him to wipe the 
gun clean, grip Jose's hand around it,  

1204
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:50,560
leaving his fingerprints on the gun. Even 
easier to do if Jose was already unconscious."

1205
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:58,640
Back at the house, Stella had found 
something. A file protected by a password.  

1206
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:05,760
Whatever she tried, family names or 
place names, she couldn't open the file.  

1207
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:11,760
I glanced around the room. There 
were a number of photographs of  

1208
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:18,080
old Russia. Opposite the desk was a 
picture of a wide avenue in a major city.

1209
02:13:19,680 --> 02:13:22,560
Mrs. Romanov noticed me studying the picture.  

1210
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:31,360
"Poor Alexei loved that street scene," 
she said. "It's the Nevsky Prospekt  

1211
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:40,320
in old St. Petersburg. That's an idea! Why 
don't you try typing in 'Nevsky Prospekt'."

1212
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,640
"Could you spell that out for me?" asked Stella.

1213
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:48,880
Again, the computer denied us access.  

1214
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:58,160
Stella keyed in the words individually, but still 
no success. Mrs. Romanov had another suggestion.

1215
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:07,040
"That street is named after the Russian 
national hero, Alexander Nevsky. Try his name,"  

1216
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:09,120
suggested Mrs. Romanov.

1217
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:15,920
Stella keyed in the words. This 
time the protected file opened.  

1218
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:22,640
There were lists of dates going back over 
the past two years at regular intervals.  

1219
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:29,200
Next to some of the dates were Russian 
names, sometimes with local addresses.  

1220
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:37,520
By some of the names there was a capital 'M' 
with a question mark. The most recent date  

1221
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:45,200
was last Friday. There were also a couple 
of future dates with an 'M?' next to them.  

1222
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:50,160
The first of these was Saturday March 16th.

1223
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:54,480
"What do you make of that?" asked Stella.

1224
02:14:55,680 --> 02:15:00,480
"Well, 'M' could stand for 
Mossolov," said Kamenev.

1225
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:09,840
"OK. If we assume that Zernov works for 
Mossolov," I said, "and if we can find out  

1226
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:16,240
what sort of operation Mossolov is running, 
then things should fall into place."

1227
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:25,120
Mrs. Romanov had been examining the names 
and dates in the computer file. "Mr. Marley,  

1228
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:32,240
I know some of these names. Some of them are 
people who Alexei helped through the Immigrant  

1229
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:43,040
Welfare Society. This one here, Boris Tchernov, 
I know he entered the country illegally. Could  

1230
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:50,400
Mossolov be smuggling in Russian immigrants? Could 
these be the dates when they were brought in?"

1231
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:59,680
"It's possible, but we'd still need more proof," 
I answered. "I'd like to talk to Tchernov, but it  

1232
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:06,080
would be helpful if you would accompany me, Mrs. 
Romanov, so there's someone he knows and trusts.  

1233
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:13,760
But that will have to wait until tomorrow. It's 
time I had another talk with Captain Oldenberg.  

1234
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:18,800
Stella, would you print me out a 
couple of hard copies of that file?"

1235
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:25,520
We said our goodbyes to Mrs. Romanov 
and left with Kamenev in his car.  

1236
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:31,920
Kamenev dropped us off at 
Police Plaza in Manhattan.

1237
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:34,480
A sergeant led us to Oldenberg's office.  

1238
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:41,680
Oldenberg was sitting with his feet up on the desk 
and didn't bother to remove them when we entered.

1239
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:47,439
"Please don't stand up just 
for us, Oldenberg," I said.

1240
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:55,520
"What made you think I would?" growled the 
captain. "I don't suppose you want some coffee."

1241
02:16:56,720 --> 02:17:02,400
"Thanks for the hospitality, but if 
it's NYPD coffee we'll do without it."

1242
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:08,400
"Sensible decision. Now what 
can I do for you, Marley?"  

1243
02:17:08,399 --> 02:17:12,000
he asked, at last removing his feet from the desk.

1244
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:20,160
There was the usual expression on the captain's 
face which seemed to say that life and work were  

1245
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:27,840
an annoyance, and I wasn't making things any 
better. It was time to get him interested.

1246
02:17:28,399 --> 02:17:31,839
"The Odessa Steps, Brighton Beach," I began.  

1247
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:38,960
"You remember I told you that Jose pulled 
that baseball bat off the wall and then got  

1248
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:45,439
out of that bar unharmed? Well, the 
reason was that he had a protector."

1249
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:51,440
"Go on, Marley. You're beginning 
to interest me," said Oldenberg.

1250
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:58,000
"I also got a witness, but I doubt whether 
he'd give a statement to the police.  

1251
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:04,479
A bartender saw Jose leave the bar 
with a big, smartly dressed guy.  

1252
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:10,880
We have a name - Nick Zernov. 
He's part of a local gang."

1253
02:18:12,319 --> 02:18:14,639
"How do you spell that?" asked the captain.

1254
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:22,479
There was a rare burst of energy from Oldenberg 
as he swung around in his chair to the computer  

1255
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:31,120
and typed in the name. A list of names came 
up on the screen, including a Nicholai Zernov.

1256
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:37,840
"He's known as Nick, so this Nicholai 
could be the guy," I suggested.

1257
02:18:39,439 --> 02:18:47,439
Oldenberg opened the file. The photo matched 
the bartender's description. Zernov had a long  

1258
02:18:47,439 --> 02:18:56,719
criminal record. Like the bartender in the Odessa 
Steps had said, he was a guy to avoid. He'd been  

1259
02:18:56,720 --> 02:19:03,520
charged with murder but found not guilty and had 
served a four-year prison sentence for robbery.

1260
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:09,760
"Oldenberg, I'm positive that's 
the guy who killed Romanov,"  

1261
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:14,080
I said. "Would you print me out a 
couple of copies of the picture?"

1262
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:18,960
"So if he is, where's your proof?"  

1263
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:23,760
demanded Oldenberg. "I don't have 
anything to charge him with."

1264
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:31,599
"Well, let's provide you with more new 
evidence," I continued. "You already know  

1265
02:19:31,600 --> 02:19:39,121
about the warning note which Mrs. Romanov found in 
her husband's jacket. I've found the guy who wrote  

1266
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:47,840
it - a Victor Kamenev, who owns Kamenev Finance. 
He has a lot of contacts in the Russian community.  

1267
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:55,281
He discovered that Romanov had been doing some 
personal investigation into what could be an  

1268
02:19:55,280 --> 02:20:02,080
illegal immigrant-smuggling operation. But his 
questions had really bothered someone by the  

1269
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:09,840
name of Mossolov. Kamenev knew Mossolov was 
angry, so he sent the warning note to Romanov."

1270
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:16,880
"OK, let's check to see if there's 
anything on this Mossolov," said Oldenberg.  

1271
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:24,640
He typed in the name, but the screen remained 
blank. He paused and thought for a moment.

1272
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:32,400
"If I'm going to charge Zernov, I need 
solid evidence. We have nothing on him  

1273
02:20:32,399 --> 02:20:36,240
except for the fact he left the 
Odessa Steps with De La Cruz.  

1274
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:42,240
It'll be easier to find evidence against 
Zernov if he's under the impression that  

1275
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:47,439
De La Cruz is charged with murder. You 
see where this is leading, Marley?"

1276
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:55,040
"You mean the official NYPD line is 
that Jose is the killer, case closed.  

1277
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:01,920
The unofficial line is that the investigation 
quietly continues," I suggested.

1278
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:06,880
"You got it," said Oldenberg. "I'll have a police  

1279
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:11,840
surveillance team watch Zernov's 
movements without being seen."

1280
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:18,080
Suddenly Stellas cell phone rang. She 
rushed out into the hallway to answer it.  

1281
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:24,000
There was a scream of joy followed 
by rapid Spanish conversation.  

1282
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:30,080
She rushed back in to the room with 
tears in her eyes and grinning broadly.

1283
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:39,840
"Nat! That was Mom. Jose's going to be all 
right. He regained consciousness this afternoon  

1284
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:46,160
and he's been talking to her. The doctors 
think the operation was a success."

1285
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:51,760
"That's great news, Stella. 
Now if you'll excuse us,  

1286
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:54,880
Oldenberg, we need to get over to the hospital."

1287
02:21:56,399 --> 02:22:02,240
"OK, Marley," said Oldenberg. "I'll call 
the guard and tell him to expect you."

1288
02:22:04,319 --> 02:22:07,840
The rush hour traffic was 
crawling through Manhattan.  

1289
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:16,240
To avoid the chaos on the streets, we took the 
subway uptown from City Hall to 103rd Street.  

1290
02:22:17,439 --> 02:22:21,839
From there it was only a few 
blocks walk to the hospital.  

1291
02:22:22,399 --> 02:22:30,479
Stella ran on ahead. I finally reached Jose's 
room, and through the window saw Stella sitting  

1292
02:22:30,479 --> 02:22:38,719
beside the bed smiling at Jose. I knocked softly 
on the door. Stella came out into the hall.

1293
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:49,359
"Nat," said Stella, "strict orders from the 
nurse. Don't get Jose over-excited. He can talk  

1294
02:22:49,359 --> 02:22:56,960
but it's all a big effort. He just needs plenty 
of rest. We've only been allowed ten minutes."

1295
02:22:58,399 --> 02:23:00,719
Jose recognized me as I walked in.  

1296
02:23:02,240 --> 02:23:09,920
"Nat, thanks for what you did on the roof. It's 
all a bit vague, but I'm told you saved my life."

1297
02:23:11,359 --> 02:23:15,200
"Don't worry," I replied. "Everything's OK now."

1298
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:23,520
"What do you mean 'OK'?" he asked, trying to 
sit up in bed. "I'm facing a murder charge!"

1299
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:32,400
"Come on, Jose. Just lie down and try to 
relax," said Stella. "You've got to rest."  

1300
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:36,480
She smiled at him and gently stroked his hand.

1301
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:46,400
As soon as Jose was calmer, I spoke to him again. 
"Jose, we've spent the last week investigating.  

1302
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:55,359
We're turning up new evidence all the time. Just 
trust us. We're doing everything possible to clear  

1303
02:23:55,359 --> 02:24:01,839
your name. I want you to concentrate 
on recovering. Be a good patient."

1304
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:11,359
"Nat, I can remember something," said Jose. 
"When I woke up in the bar, Miguel and Carlos  

1305
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:20,240
weren't around. I stood up but lost my balance. 
I reached out and grabbed the first thing I saw  

1306
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:29,519
to stop myself from falling. It came off in 
my hand. Then there I was, lying on the floor  

1307
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:35,920
with all these angry guys looking at me. I 
can't remember what happened after that."

1308
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:38,800
"Thanks, Jose," I said.

1309
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:49,280
It was time to leave Jose to rest. I succeeded in 
persuading Stella to go home. Before going back to  

1310
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:56,160
Queens, I thought I should stop by at East 43rd 
Street to check if there had been any messages.  

1311
02:24:57,520 --> 02:25:03,281
An email had arrived from Commander 
Lockhart of the U.S. Coast Guard. It read:
 
 

1312
02:25:04,319 --> 02:25:05,519
Dear Mr. Marley

1313
02:25:06,319 --> 02:25:13,599
Please contact me as soon as possible. We have 
some new evidence here that may be connected  

1314
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:20,720
with the wrecked lifeboat and fatalities at 
Jones Beach. It's a Russian fishing boat,  

1315
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:26,000
which was wrecked on Jones Beach last 
night. I'd like to show it to you.

1316
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:29,519
Best wishes Jim Lockhart

1317
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:33,280
Commander, U.S. Coast Guard Group Moriches
 
 

1318
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:42,399
I was very interested indeed. I called Lockhart 
immediately to confirm that I would be there  

1319
02:25:42,399 --> 02:25:52,240
in the morning. Enough investigating 
for one day. It was time to go home.
 
 

1320
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:53,120
CHAPTER TWELVE

1321
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,920
Wreck on Jones Beach

1322
02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:04,399
After the recent storms, the weather was now 
calmer, with the prospect of spring in the air.  

1323
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:12,320
I'd called Stella to tell her I was on my way 
to Jones Beach to inspect the fishing boat that  

1324
02:26:12,319 --> 02:26:19,920
Lockhart had told me about. Stella's instructions 
were for her to set up a meeting with Mrs. Romanov  

1325
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:27,520
that afternoon. Lockhart had arranged to meet me 
at Babylon Station on the Long Island Rail Road,  

1326
02:26:28,399 --> 02:26:34,399
then to take me across the bay to the eastern 
end of Jones Beach to the site of the wreck.

1327
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:43,600
It was an ancient-looking rusty boat. The force 
of the storm had driven it sideways onto the beach  

1328
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:51,040
above the normal high-tide mark. It lay there on 
the sand and stones, leaning at a slight angle.  

1329
02:26:52,319 --> 02:26:58,960
Barriers had been set up around the boat. A Coast 
Guard officer stood by a ladder leading up to  

1330
02:26:58,960 --> 02:27:07,680
the deck. On board, Lockhart gave me the full 
story of what had happened. The previous day,  

1331
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:14,000
in the early evening, the boat had been reported 
to the Coast Guard by a local fishing boat as  

1332
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:21,760
a potential danger to shipping. Its engine had 
failed and it was drifting helplessly off Jones  

1333
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:30,560
Beach. No emergency signals had been received. The 
crew of the local boat had tried to assist, but  

1334
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:38,640
the offer of help was rejected. "Have a good look 
around," said Lockhart. "Tell me what you think."

1335
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:45,439
I'm no sailor, but I wouldn't have felt 
confident out in the ocean in that boat.  

1336
02:27:46,479 --> 02:27:54,160
It had been some time since anybody had gone 
fishing in this floating wreck. I stuck my head  

1337
02:27:54,160 --> 02:28:02,160
into a cabin. On a table lay U.S. Navy charts for 
the south Long Island coast and New York Harbor.

1338
02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:07,919
"See those charts?" said Lockhart. 
"They're all up-to-date."

1339
02:28:09,359 --> 02:28:11,839
"What about the crew?" I asked.

1340
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:19,520
"All four crew members were captured. The boat 
was kept under observation by a helicopter from  

1341
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:25,840
the Cape Cod Air Station. As you know, 
there's easy road access to Jones Beach,  

1342
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:29,280
so we picked them up as soon 
as the boat was wrecked.  

1343
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:36,719
They were carrying Russian identification. They 
claim they don't understand a word of English,  

1344
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:43,679
so we've arranged for an interpreter. Whether 
we get anything out of them is another matter.  

1345
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:47,920
They've been taken to the Coast 
Guard First District headquarters."

1346
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:51,760
Lockhart led me down below deck.  

1347
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:58,000
There were a series of cabins fitted 
with beds with cheap nylon sleeping bags.  

1348
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:06,000
There were signs of recent occupation. The 
air smelled of stale tobacco. On the floor  

1349
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:13,439
lay Russian magazines, playing cards, smashed 
plates and cups, and the remains of a meal.

1350
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:19,359
"According to my calculations, 
there's accommodation down here  

1351
02:29:19,359 --> 02:29:22,960
for fifteen people plus crew," said Lockhart.  

1352
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:30,240
"This could be the boat that those poor Russian 
boys were in, but I can't prove anything."

1353
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:36,800
"Five bodies so far. So if 
they had been shipped here  

1354
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:41,520
on this boat there are potentially 
more fatalities?" I asked.

1355
02:29:42,479 --> 02:29:48,319
"Yes. It's unlikely there would have been any 
survivors from the lifeboat," said Lockhart.

1356
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:56,480
I accompanied Lockhart up to the bridge. 
Inside, it was full of sophisticated equipment.

1357
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:00,240
"The boat may look like a wreck,  

1358
02:30:00,240 --> 02:30:05,359
but they've installed the latest satellite 
navigation system," explained Lockhart.

1359
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:12,000
"Look at this little device. It gives 
you your exact position wherever you are.  

1360
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:20,640
My theory is the appearance of this boat 
is a deliberate disguise. From a distance,  

1361
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:27,201
it looks like any other fishing boat. A perfect 
cover for smuggling in illegal immigrants.  

1362
02:30:28,399 --> 02:30:33,040
No ship's log, though, so we have 
no record of the boat's movements.  

1363
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:38,240
If you come outside, there's 
one last thing to show you."

1364
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:46,241
Lockhart took me outside. "Look," 
he said. "The lifeboat's missing.  

1365
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:51,920
But I can't prove yet that the lifeboat 
wrecked on the beach came from this boat."

1366
02:30:53,439 --> 02:31:00,240
"So if you have this boat, does that mean it's 
the end of the smuggling operation?" I asked.

1367
02:31:01,439 --> 02:31:08,240
"We can't tell," he replied. "It wouldn't 
surprise me if they had several boats operating.  

1368
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:14,080
Also, we have no idea how 
many smuggling operations are  

1369
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:21,439
active at one time. We're going to double Coast 
Guard patrols off the south Long Island shore."

1370
02:31:23,359 --> 02:31:28,639
Back in Lockhart's car, I showed him the 
document from Romanov's computer file.

1371
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:34,560
"Take a look at these dates," I 
said. "Are there any connections  

1372
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:39,600
with incidents reported to the Coast Guard or 
that the Coast Guard has been involved with?"

1373
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:47,920
After examining the list of dates carefully, 
Lockhart said: "Yes, there's a definite  

1374
02:31:47,920 --> 02:31:55,840
pattern here. Some of these dates match 
up. Where did you get this information?"

1375
02:31:55,840 --> 02:32:02,480
"From the computer files of an Alexei Romanov, 
who was found brutally murdered last week.  

1376
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:09,041
I'm reasonably sure he was doing his own 
investigation of an immigrant smuggling  

1377
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:14,880
operation. He must have asked too many 
awkward questions and paid the price."

1378
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:20,880
Lockhart pointed to the final date 
on the list, which was the next day,  

1379
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:30,160
Saturday March 16th. "This could indicate another 
delivery of immigrants will arrive tomorrow."

1380
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:38,880
I told Lockhart about what Edie Tilden had seen 
at the Fire Island - the big smartly dressed  

1381
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:46,080
guy looking out to sea through binoculars. 
"Of course, it could be nothing," I said,  

1382
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:52,240
"but I suspect he was checking out Fire 
Island as a possible landing point."

1383
02:32:53,920 --> 02:33:01,040
Lockhart unfolded a map of the Long Island 
beaches. "Let's suppose that a boat is going to be  

1384
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:10,479
landed on Fire Island. There are lots of beaches 
but very limited road access across the bay. Any  

1385
02:33:10,479 --> 02:33:18,959
vehicle would have to return via Jones Beach from 
this point at the tip of Fire Island, and then  

1386
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:26,000
there are only three points of access back to Long 
Island. They'd be caught like rats in a trap."

1387
02:33:27,439 --> 02:33:33,839
"Maybe, but you still wouldn't catch whoever's 
in charge of the whole operation," I commented.

1388
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:42,000
Lockhart thought for a moment, then said, "I'll 
have to contact my superior officer and talk  

1389
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:50,319
this over. I think the immediate plan of action 
should be a joint Coast Guard and NYPD operation."

1390
02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:58,880
Lockhart dropped me off at Babylon Station. 
I phoned ahead to Stella and arranged to meet  

1391
02:33:58,880 --> 02:34:06,560
her at Cafe Paris on Brighton Beach Avenue. She 
had already set up a meeting with Mrs. Romanov  

1392
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:15,600
at her home. We had names and addresses of people 
from Alexei Romanov's computer file. To make  

1393
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:22,480
any progress we would need Mrs. Romanov with us 
because of her status in the Russian community.

1394
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:31,760
Stella was looking more bright and cheerful. The 
fact that Jose was at last on the road to recovery  

1395
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:39,760
must have been a huge relief. Just as we were 
about to leave the restaurant to see Mrs. Romanov,  

1396
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:43,840
there was a call from Kamenev. 
He'd been doing some research  

1397
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:53,281
and had discovered a company called 'Mossolov 
Import and Export.' In my experience, a business  

1398
02:34:53,280 --> 02:35:01,280
which describes its function as 'import and 
export' could mean anything. It was a conveniently  

1399
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:08,639
vague term that could apply to any number of 
activities. Was importing immigrants one of them?

1400
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:12,480
"I'll tell you another thing," said Kamenev.  

1401
02:35:13,359 --> 02:35:20,880
"I phoned several times but just got an answering 
machine each time. When someone finally answered  

1402
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:26,800
they just hung up without saying a word 
when I asked to speak to Mossolov."

1403
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:32,000
"Good work, Victor. Do you 
have an address?" I asked.

1404
02:35:33,439 --> 02:35:41,919
The business was located on Brighton Beach Avenue. 
It would be worth checking out. A guy like Zernov  

1405
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:50,399
wouldn't act on his own initiative. He wasn't 
paid to think. He would obey the boss's orders,  

1406
02:35:50,399 --> 02:35:58,479
and that boss could be the mysterious Mossolov. 
I passed on the information to Captain Oldenberg  

1407
02:35:59,040 --> 02:36:05,760
and also informed him about my meeting 
with Lockhart. More leads for the NYPD  

1408
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:14,000
to follow up. Oldenberg promised to put an NYPD 
surveillance unit in place to watch the office.

1409
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:21,120
At the Romanov house, I described the 
Russian fishing boat and its probable  

1410
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:28,160
function to Mrs. Romanov. She listened 
carefully, obviously upset by what she heard.  

1411
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:33,519
She turned away and held a 
handkerchief to her eyes for a moment.  

1412
02:36:34,720 --> 02:36:39,200
Then she turned back to me and 
told me what progress she had made.

1413
02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:47,840
Mrs. Romanov had already made contact with 
one of the people on the list, Boris Tchernov,  

1414
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:55,680
a young man her husband had helped personally. 
She had made an appointment with Tchernov,  

1415
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:57,201
who would come to her house.

1416
02:36:58,960 --> 02:37:05,200
Tchernov was in his late twenties. He was 
an immigrant who had been in the U.S.A. for  

1417
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:11,280
almost twelve months. His English was 
good enough to communicate effectively  

1418
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:18,479
without the need for an interpreter. He had 
met Alexei Romanov and was sincerely grateful  

1419
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:23,200
for all the assistance he had received 
from the Immigrant Welfare Society.

1420
02:37:24,720 --> 02:37:29,680
"Mr. Tchernov, does the name 'Mossolov' 
mean anything to you?" I asked.

1421
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:34,160
He shook his head. "I've never heard of it."

1422
02:37:35,359 --> 02:37:39,280
"What about 'Nick'? 'Nick Zernov'?" I asked.

1423
02:37:40,479 --> 02:37:46,879
I could see an anxious expression as I 
said the name. Tchernov knew all about him.

1424
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:54,559
"I can tell you all about Zernov. 
Three years ago, I was living in Minsk,  

1425
02:37:55,120 --> 02:38:01,439
back in the old country. It was 
a hard life. There were ten of us  

1426
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:08,160
living in a little apartment in one of the old 
Soviet buildings on the outskirts of the city.  

1427
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:16,719
I'd always dreamed of a new life in the U.S.A. 
But it was difficult to emigrate legally.  

1428
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:25,200
There's a limited number of visas available. I 
heard some gossip around that there were other  

1429
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:34,319
means of entering the country. What you needed 
was three thousand U.S. dollars. A man called  

1430
02:38:34,319 --> 02:38:41,840
Nick visited regularly, made all the arrangements, 
and promised that jobs would be waiting for us."

1431
02:38:43,439 --> 02:38:51,120
Tchernov continued with more details of the 
operation: "Provided you had the money, no  

1432
02:38:51,120 --> 02:39:00,479
questions were asked. I finally met him. Exactly 
as I had imagined - well-dressed, successful.  

1433
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:09,680
He told me stories about the U.S.A., the land 
of opportunity where any man could realize his  

1434
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:18,000
ambition - as long as you had the dollars. 
I worked every hour I could, I borrowed,  

1435
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:25,920
and, I'm ashamed to say, I stole. 
I didn't care how I got that cash."

1436
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:36,081
"There was no question of flying us in. We were 
taken to the Baltic Coast, near St. Petersburg,  

1437
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:45,440
to an isolated fishing port. I couldn't believe 
the boat they put us in. The conditions were  

1438
02:39:45,439 --> 02:39:56,479
awful - disgusting food, cold damp cabins, even 
rats. There must have been twenty of us on board.  

1439
02:39:57,600 --> 02:40:05,840
Crossing the Atlantic, one of the guys became 
seriously sick. He had terrible stomach pains.  

1440
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:13,920
We begged the captain to radio 
for help, but he refused. The guy  

1441
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:22,399
died after four days. They wrapped him up in an 
old sheet, tied a lump of concrete to his feet,  

1442
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:30,880
and dropped him overboard. I don't imagine 
his family ever got a refund from Nick."

1443
02:40:32,479 --> 02:40:40,559
"The Atlantic crossing took about ten days. Most 
of the time it was stormy, we were exhausted  

1444
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:47,840
and seasick. Finally we were all put into 
a small lifeboat in the middle of the night  

1445
02:40:48,479 --> 02:40:54,319
and dropped off on a deserted beach. 
Nick was waiting there with a truck.  

1446
02:40:55,439 --> 02:41:02,160
We were ordered to get in and lie on the floor 
and were taken to an empty factory building.  

1447
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:13,200
I remember there was some sort of railroad track 
on the floor. We waited there and eventually we  

1448
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:21,519
were taken in small groups to various addresses 
in the Brighton Beach and Coney Island area."

1449
02:41:23,359 --> 02:41:30,319
"Once we'd arrived, we learned 
the true reality of our situation.  

1450
02:41:30,319 --> 02:41:37,519
We were in the U.S.A. without entry visas 
and had none of the standard documentation.  

1451
02:41:38,800 --> 02:41:44,400
In effect, we were non-persons 
and totally in Nick's power.  

1452
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:54,080
If I was discovered by the authorities, I could be 
sent straight back to Belarus. He could exploit us  

1453
02:41:54,080 --> 02:42:01,519
any way he liked. We were given really 
miserable jobs in kitchens or workshops,  

1454
02:42:02,319 --> 02:42:09,519
working twelve hours a day or more for very 
little money - and me with a good education.  

1455
02:42:10,720 --> 02:42:18,241
My life was being dominated by him. I escaped 
but found myself living on the streets."

1456
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:28,160
"I was confused and didn't know how I would cope. 
Then, I contacted the Immigrant Welfare Society.  

1457
02:42:29,279 --> 02:42:40,160
Mr. Romanov was very kind to me and gave me money 
for food and rent. Such a good man. He was helping  

1458
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:45,920
me with my application for a Green Card 
so I could become a legal resident.  

1459
02:42:47,040 --> 02:42:54,080
I was so shocked when I heard that he'd been 
murdered. Who could have done such a thing?"

1460
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:58,480
Tchernov had come to the end of his story.  

1461
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:04,161
I took out Zernov's photograph which 
we had received from Oldenberg.

1462
02:43:05,439 --> 02:43:11,839
"This picture was taken some time ago. Does 
this guy look anything like Nick?" I asked.

1463
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:16,639
Boris examined the picture 
closely and handed it back.

1464
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:23,440
"He's put on weight and lost 
some hair, but that's him."
 
 

1465
02:43:26,960 --> 02:43:28,080
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1466
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:30,960
A message from Mossolov

1467
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:40,399
It was almost six o'clock by the time we got back 
to East 43rd Street. The light on the answering  

1468
02:43:40,399 --> 02:43:50,160
machine was flashing. Stella pressed the playback 
button. A brief but threatening anonymous message:

1469
02:43:50,160 --> 02:43:56,000
"If you know what's good for your 
health, keep out of our business."

1470
02:43:57,680 --> 02:44:04,960
Someone was trying to warn us off and was 
prepared to use violence. But I wasn't  

1471
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:12,720
intending to lose any sleep over it. We had done 
enough for one day and I told Stella to go home.  

1472
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:20,479
I stayed on at the office for a while, sorting 
through some old case papers and filing them away.  

1473
02:44:21,920 --> 02:44:29,040
The phone rang. I grabbed it and said: 
"Marley speaking." But there was just  

1474
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:36,479
silence. Exactly the same thing happened 
twice again, at fifteen-minute intervals.  

1475
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:45,840
Whoever was at the other end wasn't talkative. 
I was starting to get suspicious. We have one of  

1476
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:53,200
those phones that displays the caller's number. I 
tried calling the number, but there was no answer.  

1477
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:59,840
Maybe someone was keeping track of where I was.

1478
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:05,680
I put a call through to the Coast Guard 
to see if Lockhart had anything to report  

1479
02:45:05,680 --> 02:45:13,120
from their patrols off southern Long Island. 
Nothing as yet. It had been a long day,  

1480
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:20,720
and the ideal way to finish it off was an 
appointment with a cold beer at McFadden's Bar.

1481
02:45:22,399 --> 02:45:26,639
Outside, East 43rd Street 
was practically deserted.  

1482
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:34,320
Was it my imagination or was there someone 
watching me in the shadows of a service entrance  

1483
02:45:34,319 --> 02:45:43,679
across the street? I went over to investigate. 
Nobody there. Either my eyes were playing tricks  

1484
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:50,160
on me or I was turning into a nervous 
wreck. Definitely time for that beer.  

1485
02:45:51,359 --> 02:45:56,719
I would feel more comfortable where there 
was noise, bright lights and company.

1486
02:45:58,240 --> 02:46:05,359
I ordered a large beer and stayed by the bar for a 
while, chatting with some of the regular guys from  

1487
02:46:05,359 --> 02:46:14,880
the Daily News. The tiredness was beginning to hit 
me. Time to go home. But I'd forgotten something.  

1488
02:46:15,680 --> 02:46:21,760
I patted my pockets and realized I'd left 
the keys to my apartment in the office.

1489
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:29,600
Returning along East 43rd Street, I 
suddenly became aware of a large black  

1490
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:37,840
limo following me very slowly. I turned around and 
started walking rapidly in the other direction.  

1491
02:46:39,279 --> 02:46:46,800
As I was passing the car, it stopped and a 
door suddenly swung open, blocking my path.  

1492
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:54,960
I stepped aside to avoid the door, but a large, 
heavily built guy was already out of the car,  

1493
02:46:55,600 --> 02:47:03,201
standing directly in front of me. I immediately 
recognized the bushy eyebrows and broken nose:  

1494
02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:12,880
Nick Zernov. He was easily six inches taller 
than me. The street was completely deserted.  

1495
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:20,800
If I tried to run, I knew Zernov, being younger 
and in better shape, would easily catch me.  

1496
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:25,120
The only sensible thing to do was to talk.

1497
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:30,241
"Good evening. Lost your 
way or something?" I asked.

1498
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:37,520
Zernov's response was to lift me up 
effortlessly by my coat. His forehead  

1499
02:47:37,520 --> 02:47:44,241
was now level with my nose. That's what I 
call a serious invasion of personal space.  

1500
02:47:45,439 --> 02:47:49,120
I didn't like the idea of 
my nose being broken either.

1501
02:47:50,560 --> 02:48:00,880
"Marley, I have a message from Mossolov," said 
Zernov. "Stop asking questions. Don't stick your  

1502
02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:09,359
big nose in our business! Mossolov knows you've 
been watching us and wants you to call your people  

1503
02:48:09,359 --> 02:48:15,839
off. Otherwise, I'll have to break 
your legs. Is that clear, Marley?"

1504
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:22,319
"Couldn't be clearer," I replied. 
"Message received and understood."

1505
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:29,840
Zernov got back inside the car 
which sped off towards Park Avenue.

1506
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:36,560
I'd learned two things from the meeting. First, 
that Zernov was definitely working for Mossolov.  

1507
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:44,640
Second, Mossolov thought I had been watching them. 
They hadn't connected the surveillance operation  

1508
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:52,880
with the NYPD. This was a possible advantage. If 
they didn't think that the police were involved,  

1509
02:48:52,880 --> 02:49:00,400
they might still go ahead with another immigrant 
smuggling operation. I'd have to contact Oldenberg  

1510
02:49:00,399 --> 02:49:07,839
to tell him to make the police operation less 
obvious. Then they'd assume they'd scared me off.

1511
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:13,041
I went back to the office 
and called Captain Oldenberg.  

1512
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:19,520
Fortunately he was still at his desk. 
I explained what had just happened.

1513
02:49:20,720 --> 02:49:23,920
"Do you have anything new on Zernov?" I asked.

1514
02:49:24,800 --> 02:49:27,840
"We have some good photos," Oldenberg said.  

1515
02:49:28,880 --> 02:49:35,600
"Zernov was twice seen entering the Mossolov 
Import Export office on Brighton Beach Avenue.  

1516
02:49:36,160 --> 02:49:42,639
But we haven't had a sighting of the boss of 
the organization. Zernov's been seen with two  

1517
02:49:42,640 --> 02:49:48,400
men and a woman on a couple of occasions. 
I'll email some pictures through to you."

1518
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:54,960
One more call before I could go 
home. This time to Joe Blaney.

1519
02:49:56,080 --> 02:50:03,600
"Joe, I've had a serious threat made against 
me. I need protection. You'll need to be armed.  

1520
02:50:04,640 --> 02:50:10,960
And another thing, will you rent a car? 
Anything that's powerful but looks anonymous.  

1521
02:50:11,840 --> 02:50:13,040
Could you start this evening?"

1522
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:18,480
"Sure, boss. I'm not doing anything 
else at the moment," Joe replied.

1523
02:50:19,600 --> 02:50:25,760
"OK, then. Pack a suitcase and come 
to my apartment at 9:00 PM," I said.

1524
02:50:27,359 --> 02:50:33,040
On the subway home, I immediately 
fell fast asleep but knew,  

1525
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:39,120
as always, I'd wake up just before the 
train arrived at Main Street, Queens.  

1526
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:47,279
It's a technique I've developed over long years 
of commuting. On Main Street, I bought a bottle  

1527
02:50:47,279 --> 02:50:53,599
of chilled white wine at the local liquor 
store and got myself a Korean take-out meal.  

1528
02:50:54,720 --> 02:50:59,680
It was my intention finally to have 
the quiet evening I'd promised myself.

1529
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:07,760
When Joe arrived I knew I would sleep 
more soundly. It's reassuring to have an  

1530
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:16,240
ex-NYPD heavyweight boxing champion sharing 
the apartment. Since I left the NYPD,  

1531
02:51:16,240 --> 02:51:23,599
I've never carried a gun. Normally, my 
philosophy is that if a job involves using a gun,  

1532
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:29,760
it's a job not worth taking. That's on 
account of the potential health risks.  

1533
02:51:30,720 --> 02:51:36,640
I knew if Joe had to use a gun, he'd be 
more accurate than I could ever hope to be.

1534
02:51:38,240 --> 02:51:45,840
There would be no weekend break. I 
wanted to bring this case to a close.
 
 

1535
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:49,200
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1536
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:50,880
Memories

1537
02:51:53,040 --> 02:52:00,160
Saturday morning, the weather forecast promised 
clear, mild weather over the weekend. Perfect  

1538
02:52:00,160 --> 02:52:04,000
conditions for landing immigrants 
along the Long Island shore?  

1539
02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:13,041
Joe and I got an early start and had arrived at 
East 43rd Street by 8:00 AM. The light on the  

1540
02:52:13,040 --> 02:52:19,840
answering machine was flashing, a message from 
Mrs. Romanov asking me to call her urgently.

1541
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:23,519
"Mrs. Romanov? Marley here."

1542
02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:32,241
"I'm so glad you've called. I've had some 
dreadful news." said Mrs. Romanov. "You  

1543
02:52:32,240 --> 02:52:38,960
remember the bartender at the Odessa Steps 
who witnessed Zernov leaving with De La Cruz?  

1544
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:48,560
He's been badly beaten up. And not only him. 
The manager of the bar was also attacked."

1545
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:51,760
"I'm terribly sorry to hear that.  

1546
02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:58,720
This is probably Zernov's work. He's 
making sure they stay silent," I said.

1547
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:04,800
"Well, he's succeeded. 
They're absolutely terrified.  

1548
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:10,480
I heard about this through contacts 
at the Immigrant Welfare Society.  

1549
02:53:11,359 --> 02:53:17,200
It was a brutal attack. That man 
Zernov must not get away with it."

1550
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:22,960
I was just thinking about 
contacting Oldenberg and Lockhart  

1551
02:53:22,960 --> 02:53:28,240
when the phone rang. It was Stella, 
calling from Metropolitan Hospital.

1552
02:53:29,279 --> 02:53:37,840
"Nat, thank God I've caught you. I've been trying 
your apartment. It's Jose. His memory's returning,  

1553
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:42,560
and he wants to speak to you. Can 
you get over to the hospital now?"

1554
02:53:43,680 --> 02:53:45,600
"I'm on my way," I replied.

1555
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:52,319
Jose was looking much brighter. 
His head was heavily bandaged,  

1556
02:53:52,319 --> 02:53:58,160
but he was sitting up in bed. "Nat, 
it's all coming back," said Jose,  

1557
02:53:58,880 --> 02:54:05,840
"what happened on that night out. I can 
remember things now - places, people, faces."

1558
02:54:07,439 --> 02:54:12,879
Piece by piece, Jose put the story 
together. Everything matched what  

1559
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:19,920
I already knew until he reached the point 
where he'd made a grab for the baseball bat.

1560
02:54:19,920 --> 02:54:28,160
"OK, now Jose, take it slowly from this point," 
I said. "Tell me everything you saw or heard."

1561
02:54:29,359 --> 02:54:37,040
"I looked up and saw this crowd standing 
over me. Wow! They were mad as hell at me.  

1562
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:44,720
I couldn't understand what I'd done. Then I 
realized it was something to do with the bat.  

1563
02:54:45,760 --> 02:54:49,200
I heard someone shouting 
'What the hell are you doing?'  

1564
02:54:50,240 --> 02:54:57,599
I was lying there, scared, surrounded by a 
bunch of real angry guys. Then someone pushed  

1565
02:54:57,600 --> 02:55:03,040
through the crowd and said: 'Don't touch 
him. He's mine. I'll take care of him'."

1566
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:06,080
"What did he look like?" I asked.

1567
02:55:06,800 --> 02:55:14,000
"A big, tough guy, as tall as Joe here," 
said Jose. "He was wearing a shiny suit.  

1568
02:55:14,640 --> 02:55:21,920
Expensive-looking. He didn't look pretty. He had 
a face like a boxer who's lost too many fights."

1569
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:27,439
"Sounds exactly like our 
friend Zernov. Go on, Jose."

1570
02:55:28,479 --> 02:55:33,679
"He picked me up off the floor. This 
guy's name, you said it was Zernov?  

1571
02:55:34,399 --> 02:55:38,240
Well he was holding my arm 
behind my back with a tight grip.  

1572
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:45,200
Then he spoke again to the crowd, and repeated: 
'I'll take care of him. Got any objections?"'

1573
02:55:46,399 --> 02:55:48,479
"Then he bought you a drink?" I asked.

1574
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:57,279
"Yeah. He gave me drink after drink. I felt like 
I was going to be sick but I was too scared to  

1575
02:55:57,279 --> 02:56:05,359
refuse. He started asking me all these questions. 
He wanted to know where I was from and what I was  

1576
02:56:05,359 --> 02:56:12,319
doing in Brighton Beach. Then he said he'd 
give me a lift home and took me outside.  

1577
02:56:12,319 --> 02:56:19,679
I tried to escape, but he was too quick for 
me. My arm was pushed up so far behind my back  

1578
02:56:19,680 --> 02:56:26,560
that I thought it'd break. He took me down a side 
street, pushed me up against a wall, and said,  

1579
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:34,559
'You're coming with me.' He grabbed me by the neck 
until I couldn't breathe. And that's the point,  

1580
02:56:34,560 --> 02:56:41,520
Nat, where everything goes blank. The next 
thing I knew I was here in a hospital bed."

1581
02:56:42,640 --> 02:56:43,520
"Thanks, Jose.  

1582
02:56:44,399 --> 02:56:49,439
You'll need to make a full statement to the 
police. Do you feel well enough to do that?"

1583
02:56:50,399 --> 02:56:57,040
"No problem," replied Jose. "But I want to 
get out of here. It's been nearly two weeks."

1584
02:56:58,240 --> 02:57:04,639
"It's not going to be long now," I said. "But 
you have to stay here under police guard, so  

1585
02:57:04,640 --> 02:57:12,161
Zernov and company think they've gotten away with 
it. Just hang on. The police are going to spread  

1586
02:57:12,160 --> 02:57:20,399
some misinformation. So whatever you hear on the 
news, or read in the papers, ignore it. It'll just  

1587
02:57:20,399 --> 02:57:26,559
encourage Zernov and Mossolov to remain under the 
impression that the police think you're guilty."

1588
02:57:28,399 --> 02:57:34,399
Back at East 43rd Street, there was a 
message from Captain Oldenberg. A joint  

1589
02:57:34,399 --> 02:57:40,319
meeting between the NYPD and the Coast 
Guard had been arranged for two o'clock  

1590
02:57:40,319 --> 02:57:47,519
at police headquarters. Oldenberg had invited 
me to attend. I put a call through to him.

1591
02:57:48,479 --> 02:57:51,359
"What do you want, Marley?" growled the captain.

1592
02:57:52,399 --> 02:57:59,120
"You sound full of the joys of spring, Oldenberg," 
I said. "Couple of things you could do for me.  

1593
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:06,399
First, send an officer to Metropolitan Hospital 
to take a full statement from De La Cruz.  

1594
02:58:07,279 --> 02:58:14,399
His memory's returning, and it includes a positive 
I.D. of a guy matching Zernov's description."

1595
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:18,800
"Sure," said Oldenberg. "Anything else?"

1596
02:58:19,760 --> 02:58:26,000
"I'd like you to spread a rumor, in advance of 
this afternoon's meeting. Could you arrange to  

1597
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:32,000
issue a statement to the press to the effect that 
De La Cruz will be released from the hospital  

1598
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:38,880
today and taken to Rikers Island prison 
before his trial for the murder of Romanov.  

1599
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:44,399
I want this distributed to all 
the local radio and TV stations,  

1600
02:58:45,120 --> 02:58:47,760
and I also want it in the Sunday newspapers.  

1601
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:56,080
My theory is, the more misinformation you create, 
the more likely Mossolov is to make a move."

1602
02:58:57,279 --> 02:59:01,920
"You got it, Marley. I'll have the 
press office get on to it immediately.  

1603
02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:07,201
And those pictures of Zernov that I 
promised you. I'll email them now."

1604
02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:13,840
Oldenberg was true to his word. 
Within minutes the photos arrived.  

1605
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:20,720
The picture quality wasn't great but there 
was enough detail there to make out Zernov,  

1606
02:59:21,279 --> 02:59:26,639
looking huge and ugly, as normal. "What 
do you think of these?" I asked Joe.

1607
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:32,640
"Well, he's been getting around a lot 
lately and meeting a lot of people."  

1608
02:59:33,600 --> 02:59:38,560
He pointed to one of the pictures 
showing Zernov opening the limo door  

1609
02:59:38,560 --> 02:59:45,121
for a big man in an expensive suit and dark 
glasses. "Is that Mossolov do you think?"

1610
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:47,600
"Could be," I answered.

1611
02:59:48,800 --> 02:59:53,200
In the next photo, the same man 
was standing next to a woman  

1612
02:59:53,200 --> 03:00:00,960
with long dark hair. "And who's the woman? 
Another colleague? Mossolov's wife?" I said.

1613
03:00:02,240 --> 03:00:08,160
I looked out the window. As promised on the 
early weather forecast, it was clear and  

1614
03:00:08,160 --> 03:00:15,120
calm. These conditions would be exactly what 
Mossolov needed to bring in the next boatload.

1615
03:00:16,399 --> 03:00:22,160
A call came through from Lockhart to confirm 
that he would be present at the afternoon  

1616
03:00:22,160 --> 03:00:28,399
meeting. He also brought me up-to-date on the 
latest developments from the Coast Guard end.

1617
03:00:29,520 --> 03:00:36,161
"One of the captured crew members decided to 
talk. I'll email a copy of the statement in  

1618
03:00:36,160 --> 03:00:41,359
advance of the meeting. It makes for 
interesting reading. There's strong  

1619
03:00:41,359 --> 03:00:47,040
evidence that the casualties on Jones Beach and 
the wreck of the fishing boat are connected."

1620
03:00:48,720 --> 03:00:52,000
As soon as the email was printed out, I glanced  

1621
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:58,560
quickly through it until I came to the relevant 
section. Then I read slowly and carefully.
 
 

1622
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:06,480
We were carrying ten Russian immigrants. The 
captain stopped about a kilometer off shore,  

1623
03:01:07,120 --> 03:01:13,279
and the men were loaded onto the lifeboat. 
We had complained to the captain about the  

1624
03:01:13,279 --> 03:01:17,679
condition of the lifeboat. The 
captain ignored the complaints.

1625
03:01:19,040 --> 03:01:24,960
A signal was received from the shore. Then 
the lifeboat set off towards the light.  

1626
03:01:26,160 --> 03:01:34,160
When it had covered about half the distance, 
the weather changed rapidly. A storm blew up.

1627
03:01:34,160 --> 03:01:36,479
We could see that the boat was in trouble.  

1628
03:01:37,439 --> 03:01:42,080
They couldn't seem to control it. 
I guess the motor had broken down.

1629
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:52,319
Then we lost sight of it. I begged the captain 
to move in and pick up any survivors. Eventually  

1630
03:01:52,319 --> 03:01:57,679
he agreed, but by the time we reached 
the area, there was nothing to be seen.

1631
03:01:59,040 --> 03:02:03,600
We were now in danger of being 
driven onto the shore ourselves,  

1632
03:02:04,240 --> 03:02:06,719
so we had to leave and head out to sea.

1633
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:13,840
It was then that we started to have engine 
trouble. The captain tried to steer away  

1634
03:02:13,840 --> 03:02:18,480
from the Long Island shore, but the 
engine was gradually losing power.  

1635
03:02:19,760 --> 03:02:28,480
Day after day, we tried to fix the engine, but 
nothing worked. Eventually, a combination of wind  

1636
03:02:28,479 --> 03:02:36,639
and currents started to push the ship back towards 
the coast. When the next storm blew up, the motor  

1637
03:02:36,640 --> 03:02:45,201
finally failed completely. We were helpless. 
Also, we didn't have a life-boat to escape in.  

1638
03:02:46,240 --> 03:02:52,639
Our boat was finally wrecked on Jones Beach, and 
the crew members were arrested by the Coast Guard.

1639
03:02:54,319 --> 03:03:00,479
I continued reading through to the end. 
No mention of any names of the people who  

1640
03:03:00,479 --> 03:03:07,599
could be behind the operation. If there was 
no connection here to Zernov and Mossolov,  

1641
03:03:08,319 --> 03:03:13,840
maybe they would still go ahead with an 
attempt to land illegal immigrants.
 
 

1642
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:18,800
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1643
03:03:19,840 --> 03:03:21,040
Closing the net

1644
03:03:23,040 --> 03:03:30,000
As Joe drove me downtown on Second Avenue to 
police headquarters, I turned on the car radio  

1645
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:37,840
and checked the local radio stations to see if I 
could find any news. I caught a bulletin on WNYC.  

1646
03:03:39,279 --> 03:03:43,439
Oldenberg's press office had achieved 
everything I could have hoped for.  

1647
03:03:44,479 --> 03:03:50,399
Jose was named as having been arrested and 
charged with the murder of Alexei Romanov.

1648
03:03:51,680 --> 03:03:57,440
Perfect. The publicity would, 
hopefully, deceive Zernov and Mossolov.  

1649
03:03:58,560 --> 03:04:02,560
As long as they were acting 
under a false sense of security,  

1650
03:04:02,560 --> 03:04:07,920
they might proceed with bringing 
in the next shipment of immigrants.

1651
03:04:07,920 --> 03:04:12,560
At police headquarters, Oldenberg 
and Lockhart were reviewing the case.

1652
03:04:13,920 --> 03:04:21,760
After a while, I spoke up: "Let's assume that 
Romanov was murdered on Mossolov's orders because  

1653
03:04:21,760 --> 03:04:29,360
he knew too much about their operation. At least 
some of the dates we found on Romanov's computer  

1654
03:04:29,359 --> 03:04:36,399
are the same dates when the smuggling operations 
took place. We have a future date on that list.  

1655
03:04:37,600 --> 03:04:43,440
Now assuming the shipment will be landed 
on Fire Island, then it should be a simple  

1656
03:04:43,439 --> 03:04:52,080
surveillance operation to follow any vehicle to 
its destination. That's where we should strike. I  

1657
03:04:52,080 --> 03:04:57,359
doubt whether Mossolov is going to run the 
risk of hanging around exposed beaches."

1658
03:04:58,720 --> 03:05:01,920
"All seems logical enough to me," said Lockhart.

1659
03:05:03,040 --> 03:05:09,519
"Now we already know that Mossolov Import and 
Export is located on Brighton Beach Avenue.  

1660
03:05:10,479 --> 03:05:17,200
I don't believe the immigrants will be taken 
there. It'd be too obvious. I know from Boris  

1661
03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:22,399
Tchernov's statements that the immigrants 
were taken to some sort of factory building  

1662
03:05:22,399 --> 03:05:29,359
in the Coney Island area. I would suggest 
that any vehicle they use to move the people  

1663
03:05:29,359 --> 03:05:35,040
is followed at a very safe 
distance, maybe by NYPD helicopter.  

1664
03:05:36,160 --> 03:05:41,359
Then have police units standing by in the 
Coney Island and Brighton Beach area."

1665
03:05:42,800 --> 03:05:51,600
Oldenberg and Lockhart then proceeded to organize 
the combined NYPD/Coast Guard operation. The plan  

1666
03:05:51,600 --> 03:05:58,720
was to have a Coast Guard patrol boat out 
at sea observing any movements there. Also,  

1667
03:05:58,720 --> 03:06:03,360
a Coast Guard helicopter from Air 
Station Cape Cod would be on patrol  

1668
03:06:04,080 --> 03:06:09,439
and Coast Guard officers would be posted 
along Fire Island at regular intervals.  

1669
03:06:10,720 --> 03:06:16,560
The police part of the operation was to observe 
all road exit points from the beaches to the  

1670
03:06:16,560 --> 03:06:23,121
mainland and report to the NYPD helicopter, 
which would then follow the suspicious vehicle.  

1671
03:06:24,399 --> 03:06:30,160
Four unmarked NYPD cars would be placed 
along the length of Neptune Avenue,  

1672
03:06:30,720 --> 03:06:34,000
ready to pursue the vehicle 
to its final destination.

1673
03:06:35,359 --> 03:06:42,240
I had a special request to make. "Oldenberg, 
I'm not in the habit of asking favors from you,  

1674
03:06:42,800 --> 03:06:46,960
but I want to be in on this operation 
with my colleague Joe Blaney.  

1675
03:06:47,920 --> 03:06:54,399
You realize that I've provided the NYPD with 
most of the information in this case so far?"

1676
03:06:55,520 --> 03:06:57,360
"Yes," replied Oldenberg.

1677
03:06:58,399 --> 03:07:03,599
"And you know my personal interest 
in this case. I want to prove,  

1678
03:07:03,600 --> 03:07:11,840
without any doubt, that De La Cruz is innocent. 
And also, I want to find out who killed Romanov.  

1679
03:07:12,800 --> 03:07:17,840
I need a confession. That's why we 
have to be there at the finish."

1680
03:07:18,960 --> 03:07:25,840
"You're both ex-NYPD, so you're well aware 
of the risks," said Oldenberg bluntly.  

1681
03:07:26,800 --> 03:07:33,360
"You have my permission, but don't even think 
about playing the hero, Marley. Understood?  

1682
03:07:34,319 --> 03:07:41,200
We'll have all units in position by dusk, and I'll 
keep in regular contact with you by cell phone."

1683
03:07:42,800 --> 03:07:45,840
Joe and I had little else to do until nightfall.  

1684
03:07:46,800 --> 03:07:52,320
Before leaving for Coney Island, I put a 
call through to Stella to give her an update.

1685
03:07:53,200 --> 03:08:01,120
"Nat, those news bulletins!" exclaimed Stella. 
"They're just awful! What a relief they're not  

1686
03:08:01,120 --> 03:08:07,120
true! I've had calls from just about every 
relative in the family about the news.  

1687
03:08:08,080 --> 03:08:10,080
I just had to tell them not to worry."

1688
03:08:11,359 --> 03:08:15,120
"Well, if those bulletins 
have fooled all your family,  

1689
03:08:15,120 --> 03:08:19,840
let's hope they have the same effect 
on Zernov and Mossolov," I remarked.

1690
03:08:21,279 --> 03:08:26,639
Another call to Mrs. Romanov to inform 
her of the real purpose of the bulletins  

1691
03:08:27,200 --> 03:08:30,800
and to reassure her that we 
were making definite progress.

1692
03:08:32,080 --> 03:08:38,640
"I'm reasonably optimistic that your husband's 
killer will be behind bars by tomorrow," I said.

1693
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:44,479
"Take care, Mr. Marley and 
God be with you," she replied.

1694
03:08:45,840 --> 03:08:52,560
We headed off in the rental car towards the 
Brooklyn Bridge. Through the steel network I  

1695
03:08:52,560 --> 03:08:59,121
could see that the waters of the East River were 
smooth and calm, with the late afternoon sunshine  

1696
03:08:59,120 --> 03:09:04,800
reflecting off the surface. We passed 
rapidly through the suburbs of Brooklyn  

1697
03:09:04,800 --> 03:09:11,200
on Ocean Parkway, which eventually brought us 
onto Surf Avenue, parallel to the oceanfront.

1698
03:09:12,640 --> 03:09:20,240
We had some time to kill, so I asked Joe to 
continue west along Surf Avenue. The amusement  

1699
03:09:20,239 --> 03:09:28,080
parks, dominated by the huge roller coaster 
rides soon came into view. One of those rides  

1700
03:09:28,080 --> 03:09:33,760
which had terrified and delighted me as a 
child was still operating - the Cyclone.  

1701
03:09:34,800 --> 03:09:40,800
I still remember the way the train of little cars 
would climb up the track to the highest point,  

1702
03:09:41,520 --> 03:09:46,880
then dive and shake down what felt 
like a series of near-vertical drops.

1703
03:09:48,319 --> 03:09:55,359
There was another roller coaster ride standing 
behind locked gates. I examined the curves  

1704
03:09:55,359 --> 03:10:04,399
and slopes. Now I recognized it as the old 
Thunderbolt, another childhood favorite. Sadly,  

1705
03:10:04,399 --> 03:10:11,839
it was now in a state of total disrepair with 
peeling paintwork, rust, and fire damage.

1706
03:10:12,479 --> 03:10:19,040
The sun was now sinking low and the western 
sky was glowing with shades of orange and pink.  

1707
03:10:20,160 --> 03:10:22,160
It was going to be a long night.

1708
03:10:23,600 --> 03:10:30,000
It was completely dark when I received the 
first call from Oldenberg. The Coast Guard  

1709
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:37,760
had been following the movements of ships off the 
Long Island coast all day. As the light faded,  

1710
03:10:37,760 --> 03:10:44,000
a fishing boat had turned towards the shore and 
was now heading in the direction of Fire Island.

1711
03:10:45,359 --> 03:10:53,839
"It looks like it's all happening, Joe," 
I said. "Time to get in position."
 
 

1712
03:10:55,040 --> 03:10:56,160
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

1713
03:10:57,040 --> 03:10:58,560
Face to face

1714
03:11:00,720 --> 03:11:07,840
Time seemed to drag as Joe and I sat waiting in 
the car, in a parking lot off Neptune Avenue.  

1715
03:11:08,880 --> 03:11:15,120
Joe had brought a police radio with him so we 
could listen in on the action. I didn't want  

1716
03:11:15,120 --> 03:11:22,479
to feel we were missing any of the excitement. 
Soon after ten o'clock, we received a report of  

1717
03:11:22,479 --> 03:11:28,639
the first definite sighting from Oldenberg. 
Coast Guard observers had watched a small  

1718
03:11:28,640 --> 03:11:37,440
boat land a party of ten men and four packages 
at the eastern end of Fire Island. A white Ford  

1719
03:11:37,439 --> 03:11:44,160
truck had arrived, driven by a tall, heavily 
built guy who matched Zernov's description.  

1720
03:11:45,279 --> 03:11:51,040
The truck had picked up the men and the packages 
and had been spotted leaving Fire Island.  

1721
03:11:52,720 --> 03:11:58,560
Later, Oldenberg informed us that the 
truck was now on Long Island Highway 27,  

1722
03:11:59,200 --> 03:12:06,239
heading toward Freeport. The NYPD helicopter 
was following its movements at a safe distance.

1723
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:13,360
It was around eleven o'clock when we heard that 
the truck was approaching the Coney Island area.  

1724
03:12:14,160 --> 03:12:20,960
The helicopter pilot was having trouble following 
the vehicle. An ocean storm was brewing,  

1725
03:12:20,960 --> 03:12:27,200
and a lot of fog was rolling in. Not ideal 
conditions for surveillance from the air.

1726
03:12:28,560 --> 03:12:35,680
The pilot now reported that the truck was on the 
eastern side of JFK airport, on the Belt Parkway,  

1727
03:12:36,239 --> 03:12:42,559
which circles the coast around Jamaica 
Bay. Frequent banks of fog continued to  

1728
03:12:42,560 --> 03:12:49,440
make observation from the air a problem. Then 
we heard a panicky note in the pilot's voice.  

1729
03:12:50,479 --> 03:12:55,120
"Captain Oldenberg, we're losing 
him... No, there he is again..."

1730
03:12:55,840 --> 03:13:04,080
This is getting difficult. There's more fog 
ahead. Lost him. No, we've got him again. Captain,  

1731
03:13:04,080 --> 03:13:09,920
we may not be able to keep the suspect under 
surveillance. The truck's heading east on the  

1732
03:13:09,920 --> 03:13:17,440
Belt Parkway now. I suggest you move all units 
now to the Belt Parkway exits for Coney Island."

1733
03:13:18,880 --> 03:13:24,720
Finally we heard the pilot admit defeat. 
"Captain Oldenberg, we've lost him."

1734
03:13:25,920 --> 03:13:30,560
There was radio silence for a 
time. Then a sighting of the  

1735
03:13:30,560 --> 03:13:36,081
truck leaving the Belt Parkway at exit 
seven and heading towards Ocean Parkway.

1736
03:13:37,439 --> 03:13:43,839
A call from Oldenberg: "Marley, the 
truck's in Coney Island, on Ocean Parkway.  

1737
03:13:44,479 --> 03:13:50,959
I have one unit already following, and I'm 
ordering all units in. I'll keep you posted."

1738
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:59,200
We continued listening in on the police radio. 
At first everything went smoothly until the  

1739
03:13:59,200 --> 03:14:04,800
intersection at Brighton Beach Parkway. 
An officer was speaking to Oldenberg:  

1740
03:14:05,840 --> 03:14:12,400
"Captain, we have the suspect in sight. 
We're about fifty yards behind. Red light,  

1741
03:14:12,399 --> 03:14:16,960
coming to a stop. Hey! He's run 
right through the red light."

1742
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:20,399
"Try and follow," ordered Oldenberg.

1743
03:14:21,680 --> 03:14:26,000
Suddenly, over the radio, 
we heard the scream of tires  

1744
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:32,080
followed by two impacts of steel 
against steel. Then silence.

1745
03:14:33,680 --> 03:14:36,000
"Captain Oldenberg," said the officer.  

1746
03:14:36,720 --> 03:14:42,960
"We just ran into the side of a cab, and our 
other car is buried in the back of our car.  

1747
03:14:43,920 --> 03:14:49,920
Nobody hurt, just shaken up. Sorry, 
but both cars are out of action."

1748
03:14:51,120 --> 03:14:56,720
"Where's the third car?" shouted 
Oldenberg. "Get after the suspect!"

1749
03:14:57,920 --> 03:15:02,000
"Sorry Captain. The traffic's now 
at a standstill at the intersection.  

1750
03:15:02,640 --> 03:15:07,600
Nothing's moving. The third car 
can't get through. We've lost him."

1751
03:15:08,399 --> 03:15:10,239
"Hell!" swore Oldenberg.

1752
03:15:11,600 --> 03:15:18,000
A moment later, Oldenberg called me on the 
cell phone. "Marley. I hate to admit this..."

1753
03:15:18,800 --> 03:15:22,320
"But you've lost the suspect," I finished for him.  

1754
03:15:23,279 --> 03:15:29,759
"We know, Oldenberg. We've been listening in 
on the police radio. Joe and I are going to  

1755
03:15:29,760 --> 03:15:36,080
cruise around the neighborhood, just in case 
we spot something. I suggest you do the same."

1756
03:15:37,600 --> 03:15:44,640
I asked Joe to head towards Surf Avenue. 
Soon we were passing by the amusement parks,  

1757
03:15:44,640 --> 03:15:50,000
with the ghostly shapes of the big wheels 
and roller coasters appearing out of the fog.

1758
03:15:51,520 --> 03:15:57,121
As we made our way along the avenue, I started 
thinking about the surveillance photographs  

1759
03:15:57,120 --> 03:16:05,040
of Zernov. Suddenly, every piece in the puzzle 
joined together to give me a complete picture.  

1760
03:16:06,160 --> 03:16:12,880
That photograph of Zernov outside a set 
of gates. I thought back to our tour of  

1761
03:16:12,880 --> 03:16:20,239
the sights of Coney Island. The old Thunderbolt 
roller coaster. The gates with the peeling paint.  

1762
03:16:21,439 --> 03:16:25,519
Boris Tchernov's statement that 
they were taken to some sort of  

1763
03:16:25,520 --> 03:16:32,560
factory building with a railroad track on 
the floor. I knew then where they had to be.

1764
03:16:33,920 --> 03:16:38,160
"Joe, the old Thunderbolt 
roller coaster. And step on it."

1765
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:47,440
The car sped towards West 16th Street, off Surf 
Avenue. As we approached the roller coaster,  

1766
03:16:47,439 --> 03:16:51,519
the ruined structure gradually 
came into focus through the fog.  

1767
03:16:52,800 --> 03:17:00,960
I told Joe to kill the headlights as we neared the 
gates. All was quiet and the street was deserted.

1768
03:17:02,560 --> 03:17:08,800
Signs reading 'Dangerous structure - No 
admittance' were attached to the fence  

1769
03:17:08,800 --> 03:17:17,040
surrounding the old ride. The gates were at least 
ten feet high but with Joe's help I climbed over.  

1770
03:17:18,319 --> 03:17:25,840
On the other side, there was a lock and key with 
a thick steel chain. I tried the key in the lock.  

1771
03:17:26,800 --> 03:17:32,320
It turned without any effort. This 
entrance was obviously used regularly.  

1772
03:17:33,600 --> 03:17:35,920
I opened the gates to let Joe through.

1773
03:17:37,200 --> 03:17:43,359
We looked around us. Now, there was sufficient 
moonlight to provide better visibility.  

1774
03:17:44,720 --> 03:17:52,240
About seventy-five yards away, I spotted a 
white Ford truck and a limo parked alongside  

1775
03:17:52,239 --> 03:17:59,359
a one-story building in the shadows of the roller 
coaster structure. No lights could be seen.

1776
03:18:00,880 --> 03:18:08,640
A door opened. A sudden flash of light from 
the interior of the building, then darkness.

1777
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:17,520
"Get down!" I whispered to Joe. We dived for 
cover behind an ancient roller coaster car.  

1778
03:18:18,800 --> 03:18:27,279
I looked over the edge and watched. It was Zernov. 
He started to walk in the direction of the gates,  

1779
03:18:27,279 --> 03:18:34,719
shining a flashlight from side to side. We kept 
our heads low as the ray of light was directed  

1780
03:18:34,720 --> 03:18:43,440
towards us. Then he went back inside. My mouth 
was dry and my heart was beating like a drum.

1781
03:18:44,640 --> 03:18:49,040
"Joe, we need back-up. Zernov's in there,  

1782
03:18:49,040 --> 03:18:53,920
and presumably Mossolov. There 
could be more of the gang inside."

1783
03:18:55,279 --> 03:19:03,279
I called Oldenberg and gave him our location. 
"When you arrive, I want you to park so your car's  

1784
03:19:03,279 --> 03:19:12,559
blocking the gate, OK? Same for the other police 
car. Then we'll have the exit sealed. But hurry!"

1785
03:19:13,920 --> 03:19:18,000
Oldenberg made rapid time. Two minutes later we  

1786
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:24,160
heard the deep hum of the engine. Oldenberg 
and his sergeant slipped inside the gates.

1787
03:19:25,279 --> 03:19:31,840
"Over here," I whispered to Oldenberg. 
"Where's the other car?" I demanded.  

1788
03:19:32,640 --> 03:19:39,520
Oldenberg spoke urgently into his cell phone. His 
officers had gone to the wrong roller coaster.

1789
03:19:40,800 --> 03:19:48,320
Oldenberg considered the situation for a moment, 
then announced: "We're going in. All the evidence  

1790
03:19:48,319 --> 03:19:55,439
should be there. Any delay could mean we 
lose the key players. You with me, Marley?"

1791
03:19:56,399 --> 03:19:57,920
"All the way, Oldenberg."

1792
03:19:59,520 --> 03:20:06,960
We hurried over to the door of the building. From 
inside, we could hear conversation in Russian,  

1793
03:20:06,960 --> 03:20:13,840
and laughter. Although there were only the 
four of us, we had the element of surprise.

1794
03:20:14,479 --> 03:20:18,479
Oldenberg, the sergeant, and 
Joe had their weapons ready.  

1795
03:20:19,439 --> 03:20:25,839
Oldenberg nodded to his sergeant, who 
kicked the door wide open. We rushed inside.  

1796
03:20:26,640 --> 03:20:30,880
The sergeant shouted: "Police! 
Don't move! Hands in the air!"

1797
03:20:32,239 --> 03:20:39,760
For a second, the scene before us seemed to be 
frozen in time. The building was lit by oil lamps.  

1798
03:20:40,720 --> 03:20:46,960
Ten young men were sitting on benches around a 
table, drinking coffee and eating sandwiches.  

1799
03:20:48,080 --> 03:20:55,040
Zernov, who was sitting at another table, 
stared at us in disbelief. The big man from  

1800
03:20:55,040 --> 03:21:02,479
the photographs was there sitting next to Zernov. 
The woman with long dark hair was standing behind  

1801
03:21:02,479 --> 03:21:09,839
them. On the floor was the railroad track 
which Tchernov had mentioned. In a corner  

1802
03:21:09,840 --> 03:21:16,080
lay an old roller coaster car, on its side. 
The place must have been the repair workshop.

1803
03:21:17,600 --> 03:21:20,400
The woman didn't seem to be alarmed at all.  

1804
03:21:21,439 --> 03:21:27,120
Zernov looked towards her, with a confused 
expression, as if expecting instructions.  

1805
03:21:28,479 --> 03:21:33,679
Then she turned towards Zernov and screamed: 
"Don't just stand there. Do something!"

1806
03:21:35,040 --> 03:21:41,840
He suddenly got up and reached for his gun, 
but before he could aim it, two shots rang out.  

1807
03:21:42,960 --> 03:21:48,720
He spun around with the impact of the 
bullets. Then he crashed to the floor,  

1808
03:21:49,359 --> 03:21:55,759
firing his gun wildly. A bullet 
passed through one of the oil lamps,  

1809
03:21:55,760 --> 03:22:00,480
smashing the glass. A cloud 
of gunsmoke hung in the air.

1810
03:22:01,920 --> 03:22:09,840
The place now seemed unnaturally quiet. For 
a second everyone stood motionless. Then we  

1811
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:18,160
rushed forward. There were two bullet holes in 
Zernov's chest. Blood was dripping from his mouth  

1812
03:22:18,160 --> 03:22:26,160
and he was gasping for breath. He didn't 
look as if he had long to live. Meanwhile,  

1813
03:22:26,160 --> 03:22:32,399
the woman had thrown herself to the ground 
and had landed in a pool of rust-colored, oily  

1814
03:22:32,399 --> 03:22:39,599
water. As she raised herself, her face and hair 
and were dripping with the orange-black liquid.

1815
03:22:41,120 --> 03:22:45,920
I looked at the guy still sitting 
at the table. "Are you Mossolov?"

1816
03:22:47,040 --> 03:22:55,760
He stared at me, almost paralyzed with fear. "I'm 
just the driver," he stammered. "Don't shoot me."

1817
03:22:57,040 --> 03:23:00,000
The woman was now wiping the oil from her face.  

1818
03:23:00,800 --> 03:23:05,440
She looked down at her feet, not 
making eye contact with anybody.

1819
03:23:06,560 --> 03:23:14,000
Then, a slight movement from Zernov. With 
a painful effort, he slowly pointed a  

1820
03:23:14,000 --> 03:23:23,840
bloody finger towards the woman. Then the gasping 
stopped. His eyes open wide in a lifeless stare.

1821
03:23:25,520 --> 03:23:33,360
We looked at the woman in astonishment. Was 
she Mossolov? She remained standing there,  

1822
03:23:33,359 --> 03:23:38,799
looking down at the floor. The woman's 
handbag was lying on the table.  

1823
03:23:39,680 --> 03:23:45,120
I quickly found a driver's 
license: Katarina Mossolov.  

1824
03:23:46,479 --> 03:23:53,599
I showed the document to Oldenberg. "Let 
me introduce you to Mossolov," I said.

1825
03:23:54,800 --> 03:23:58,560
"Well, would you believe it!" exclaimed Oldenberg.

1826
03:24:00,080 --> 03:24:07,279
Everybody's attention was focused on Mossolov. But 
suddenly there was the sound of rapid footsteps.  

1827
03:24:08,080 --> 03:24:13,680
"Hey, where's the driver?" asked 
the sergeant urgently. From outside,  

1828
03:24:13,680 --> 03:24:21,280
we heard the sound of a motor. Then tires spinning 
and screaming as the limo raced to the gates.

1829
03:24:22,720 --> 03:24:25,840
"He won't get far," remarked Oldenberg.

1830
03:24:27,040 --> 03:24:34,960
Then came the crash of breaking wood and bending 
metal. Footsteps running down the street. A shout:  

1831
03:24:35,520 --> 03:24:40,960
"Police! Stop right there!" The 
other police car had finally arrived.

1832
03:24:42,080 --> 03:24:46,960
"They've got him," said Oldenberg. 
"From the sound of the crash,  

1833
03:24:46,960 --> 03:24:54,720
that's another NYPD car out of action. Still, 
cars are replaceable, good officers aren't."

1834
03:24:56,160 --> 03:24:58,639
I had one last favor to ask Oldenberg.  

1835
03:24:59,680 --> 03:25:05,040
"Before you charge Mossolov, I want 
a word with her. Just trust me, OK?"

1836
03:25:06,479 --> 03:25:11,040
She looked at me blankly. Oily liquid 
was still dripping from her hair.

1837
03:25:12,239 --> 03:25:20,479
"I don't enjoy being threatened," I said to her 
coldly. "The last time I met your man Zernov,  

1838
03:25:20,479 --> 03:25:28,319
he promised to break my legs if I 
didn't behave. Now look at him. The NYPD  

1839
03:25:28,319 --> 03:25:36,080
already has enough evidence against you to put 
you away for a very long time. The only choice  

1840
03:25:36,080 --> 03:25:42,880
you have is to cooperate. Unless you'd like 
my muscle man Joe to help persuade you."

1841
03:25:44,399 --> 03:25:50,000
I must have sounded convincing. I knew 
it was an empty threat, but she believed  

1842
03:25:50,000 --> 03:25:57,600
me. She looked around in alarm. Joe grinned 
unpleasantly at her to back up the message.

1843
03:25:58,960 --> 03:26:03,840
"So tell me. Did you have 
Romanov murdered?" I asked.

1844
03:26:04,560 --> 03:26:11,040
"All right. I admit it. I ordered 
Romanov's death," she said in a low,  

1845
03:26:11,040 --> 03:26:17,840
tired voice. "He knew too much and had been 
asking too many questions about my operation.  

1846
03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:26,640
Nick was carrying out my orders. But the fool 
made everything too complicated. I told him to  

1847
03:26:26,640 --> 03:26:35,201
make it look like a simple car-jacking. Nothing 
fancy. Then he found that stupid drunk in the  

1848
03:26:35,200 --> 03:26:43,760
Odessa Steps. I don't know who was more stupid, 
Nick or the drunk. Not that it matters any more."

1849
03:26:45,120 --> 03:26:53,279
I had the confession I wanted. Case closed. 
"Oldenberg, did you catch all that?" I asked.

1850
03:26:54,000 --> 03:27:00,560
"Everything, Marley. And I didn't hear you 
making any threats. May I congratulate you."

1851
03:27:01,840 --> 03:27:04,880
That was a compliment indeed, 
coming from the captain.

1852
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:12,399
"Thanks. She's all yours now. Will you 
arrange the immediate release of De La Cruz?  

1853
03:27:13,359 --> 03:27:18,399
He'll need a statement to the effect that 
he was wrongfully arrested and charged,  

1854
03:27:18,399 --> 03:27:21,920
and of course an official apology from the NYPD.  

1855
03:27:23,040 --> 03:27:27,840
His lawyer will also be asking for 
financial compensation for wrongful arrest."

1856
03:27:28,960 --> 03:27:31,040
"You got it," replied Oldenberg.

1857
03:27:32,560 --> 03:27:39,360
My hands started to tremble violently. I 
knew that old familiar reaction to shock.  

1858
03:27:40,319 --> 03:27:47,599
I felt a wave of exhaustion going through my body. 
But there were still two more things I had to do;  

1859
03:27:48,720 --> 03:27:51,360
first a call to Mrs. Romanov.

1860
03:27:52,560 --> 03:27:55,840
"Mrs. Romanov? I know who murdered your husband.  

1861
03:27:56,880 --> 03:28:04,000
Nick Zernov acting under the orders of a 
Katarina Mossolov, the woman behind the immigrant  

1862
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:12,399
smuggling. Zernov is now dead and Mossolov is 
under arrest. You'll get a full report on Monday."

1863
03:28:13,680 --> 03:28:19,120
"Thank God you're safe," said Mrs. 
Romanov. "I can't thank you enough."

1864
03:28:20,720 --> 03:28:23,840
And a call to Stella. "It's Nat.  

1865
03:28:24,479 --> 03:28:30,639
We have all the proof. Jose's going to 
be a free man. We've cleared his name."

1866
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:39,279
"Oh, Nat, I'm so relieved. I don't 
know what to say. It's like huge  

1867
03:28:39,279 --> 03:28:45,040
weight's been lifted from me. I'll have to 
phone around to all the family right now."

1868
03:28:46,160 --> 03:28:49,599
"You do that, Stella. I'll see you on Monday."

1869
03:28:51,200 --> 03:28:54,080
I took one last look around the repair shop.  

1870
03:28:55,040 --> 03:29:02,560
The glow of the oil lamps, Zernov lifeless on 
the floor, dead eyes staring into empty space,  

1871
03:29:03,760 --> 03:29:08,560
Mossolov now in handcuffs, with an 
expression of complete disbelief.  

1872
03:29:10,080 --> 03:29:15,600
The illegal immigrants were still sitting at 
the table, looking around in shocked silence.  

1873
03:29:16,960 --> 03:29:21,920
What an introduction to the 
U.S.A., the land of opportunity!  

1874
03:29:23,279 --> 03:29:29,679
Time to get back to some of that predictable, 
routine work like divorce, bad debts,  

1875
03:29:29,680 --> 03:29:37,520
and missing persons. It was safe and dull, paid 
the bills, and didn't involve being shot at.

1876
03:29:38,880 --> 03:29:47,840
"Come on, Joe. That's quite enough excitement 
for one night. Let's go home."
 
 
 
 

1877
03:30:09,399 --> 03:30:10,399
-  

1878
03:30:10,399 --> 03:30:10,746
THE END -
