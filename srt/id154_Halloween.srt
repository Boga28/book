CHAPTER ONE
A bad day at work

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,060
Angel looked at his watch.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,980
It was after nine o'clock.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,610
'Where are you, Buffy?' he thought.

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,240
The Bronze was busy tonight but Angel sat
alone.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,490
He looked at the young faces around him.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,380
People laughed and danced.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,020
'This is Buffy's world,' he thought.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,350
'Why am I here?'

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,079
But he already knew the answer.

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,059
He was there because he loved Buffy.

12
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:45,199
With his dark eyes, he watched the door.

13
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:46,199
* * *

14
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:48,280
Buffy was almost at the Bronze.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,320
It was the end of October, two nights before
Halloween.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,440
The evening was black and cold.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,010
Suddenly, something hit Buffy on the back
of her head.

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,080
She turned quickly.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,280
A vampire smiled at her - not a pretty smile.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,690
Buffy hit him hard.

21
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,600
He got up quickly and laughed.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,560
He hit back.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,250
'I haven't got time for this,' Buffy thought.

24
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,840
'Angel is waiting for me.'

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,920
She pulled a stake from her jacket.

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,100
Soon it was in the vampire's body.

27
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,780
No more vampire.

28
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,659
'Look at me!'

29
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,579
she thought.

30
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:43,719
'Tonight is my first date with Angel.

31
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,079
My clothes are dirty.

32
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,229
My hair is terrible.

33
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:51,220
This isn't a good start.'

34
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,220
* * *

35
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,280
'She isn't coming,' thought Angel.

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,000
He wasn't happy.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,689
'It's like, I know,' someone said to him.

38
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,909
'The Bronze just isn't cool.

39
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,890
Why do we come here?'

40
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,140
Angel looked up.

41
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,300
'Oh hi, Cordelia,' he said and looked back
at the door.

42
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,629
'I'm waiting for Buffy.'

43
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:19,849
'Great!'

44
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,040
she said, and sat down.

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,640
She smiled and talked.

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,920
She moved closer to Angel.

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,159
Angel didn't want her there.

48
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:38,450
But he was a nice vampire, so he smiled back
at her.

49
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,130
It was the wrong time for a smile.

50
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,310
Buffy came in and saw them together.

51
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,730
'This is stupid,' she thought.

52
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,870
'Look at Cordelia.

53
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,180
She always looks fantastic.

54
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,069
And I look... terrible.'

55
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:03,200
She turned to the door.

56
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,209
Angel saw Buffy across the room.

57
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:06,209
'Buffy?'

58
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,730
He ran to the club door.

59
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,970
'Oh... hi,' Buffy said.

60
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,340
'I'm...'

61
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,920
'... late,' Angel finished.

62
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,920
'Bad day at work,' Buffy said.

63
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
'Hmm.

64
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,370
I see,' said Angel.

65
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,500
He smiled.

66
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,220
'I love your hair, Buffy!'

67
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,900
Suddenly Cordelia was there.

68
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,560
'Very "street fashion".

69
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,020
How do you do it?'

70
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,020
She smiled at Buffy then walked back to the
table.

71
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:54,319
'Angel,' said Buffy, 'I'm going to... put
a bag over my head.

72
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,349
I can't stay here.'

73
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,959
'Don't listen to Cordelia.

74
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,770
You look great.'

75
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,959
'You're very kind,' she said.

76
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,960
But she didn't believe him.

77
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,180
'We have a date, you know,' laughed Angel.

78
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,360
'A date!'

79
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,739
She talked quietly and sadly.

80
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,509
'Other girls have dates.

81
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:24,130
Not me.

82
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,280
I never think about my hair and my shoes.

83
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,990
I don't have time.

84
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:36,610
I think about vampires and stakes and blood.'

85
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,800
She left the club.

86
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,199
Angel didn't follow her.

87
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,770
Cordelia came back and smiled.

88
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,210
'Coffee?'

89
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,139
she asked.

90
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:51,139
* * *

91
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:56,860
The next morning, Principal Snyder waited
for the students at Sunny dale High.

92
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,389
He had paper and pens.

93
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:03,310
A girl walked into school.

94
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,210
He grabbed her arm.

95
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,440
'Hey!'

96
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,960
she said.

97
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,600
'Put your name here,' he told her.

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,060
'What is it?'

99
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,370
she asked.

100
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,280
Tomorrow is Halloween, and the children of
Sunnydale are going trick-retreating.

101
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,910
They need some teenagers with them.

102
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,210
That's you.

103
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,290
Put your name here.'

104
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,560
'Can I say "no"?'

105
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,190
'No.'

106
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,930
The girl wrote her name angrily and went off.

107
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,139
'Did you see that?'

108
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:44,460
Bander asked Buffy and Willow.

109
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,460
'Yeah.

110
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,819
Let's walk faster,' said Buffy.

111
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:49,940
'Ah!

112
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,180
Miss Summers.'

113
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,889
There was a hand on her arm.

114
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,639
'Sunny dale's worst student.'

115
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,340
He smiled.

116
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,560
'Put your name here.'

117
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,150
'Oh, I love children, Principal Snyder, but...

118
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,759
I'm sorry...

119
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,880
there's something wrong with my... ermm...
hands.

120
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,660
My doctor says...'

121
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,009
Principal Snyder gave her a pen.

122
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:26,910
Then he gave two more pens to Willow and Xander.

123
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,910
'Write!

124
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,430
The trick-or-treaters leave here at four o'clock.

125
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,280
They must be home at six.

126
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,849
Don't forget your costumes.'

127
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:43,729
'I don't believe it!' said Xander.

128
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:47,520
'It's Halloween - party night.

129
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,470
And we're going to have lots of small children
with us.

130
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,740
And we're going to be in stupid costumes!'

131
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,640
'I wanted a night at home!' said Buffy.

132
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,440
'It's the only quiet night in the year for
me.'

133
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,190
'Halloween is quiet?!'

134
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,120
Xander was surprised.

135
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,780
'Isn't it party night for vampires?'

136
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,009
'No, they stay at home.

137
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,250
Giles told me.'

138
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,889
'I love those vampires,' said Xander.

139
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,070
'So usually I can stay in, too.

140
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:36,950
But now I can't.

141
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:50,300
Thanks, Snyder.'

142
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,960
CHAPTER TWO
A long, red dress

143
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,090
At morning break, Buffy and Willow got drinks.

144
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,090
'How was your date last night?' asked Willow.

145
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,300
'Bad,' said Buffy.

146
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,270
'I met a vampire on the way to the Bronze,
so I was late.

147
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,150
And I looked terrible.'

148
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,790
'Was Angel angry?'

149
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,400
'No, but only because of Cordelia.

150
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,069
She does dates, not me.'

151
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:28,409
'Cordelia?

152
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:29,919
Angel doesn't like Cordelia.'

153
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,740
'Willow, what does he like?

154
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,350
Who is he?

155
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:42,360
I met him a year ago, but I know almost nothing
about him.'

156
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:49,330
'Yeah, well, I don't have any answers,' said
Willow.

157
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,780
Then Buffy had an idea.

158
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,270
She grabbed Willow.

159
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,500
'The Watcher Diaries!'

160
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,480
'Yeah...' said Willow slowly.

161
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:08,970
'And they're Giles's books... in Giles's desk...
and Giles is a teacher.'

162
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,010
'You're right,' said Buffy with a smile.

163
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,980
'We mustn't take things from Giles's desk.

164
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,870
It's wrong.'

165
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,870
* * *

166
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,990
Buffy and Willow looked through the doors
of the library.

167
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,730
Giles wasn't there.

168
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:32,280
Willow stayed at the door and Buffy went in.

169
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,760
Buffy walked very quietly to Giles's desk.

170
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,010
'Buffy!' said Giles.

171
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,130
'Good.'

172
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,250
'Oh!'

173
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,440
She turned in surprise.

174
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,660
'Nothing!

175
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,890
Hi.'

176
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,120
'What?'

177
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,040
Giles looked at her.

178
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,680
Was she a bit strange today?

179
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,270
'Now, about tomorrow night.

180
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,400
Halloween is always quiet.

181
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,640
Maybe we can try some new kicks...'

182
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,520
'Giles,' Buffy stopped him.

183
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,960
'Don't you just have fun sometimes?'

184
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:17,660
'I have lots of fun hobbies,' said Giles,
and opened a book.

185
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,350
Buffy looked at the door, at Willow.

186
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,580
Her eyes said, 'Come in.

187
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,770
Get the Watcher Diaries.

188
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,080
Giles isn't looking.'

189
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,030
Willow's mouth said, 'No!'

190
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,270
Buffy's eyes said, 'Now!'

191
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,570
Willow walked across the room behind Giles.

192
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,560
'What hobbies?'

193
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,740
asked Buffy.

194
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:50,060
'Well,' Giles started, 'I, -er... sometimes
I clean my books.

195
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,380
I enjoy that.'

196
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,550
'One day, leave your books for an hour or
two, Giles.

197
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,630
There's a world out there.

198
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,110
There's this cool place.

199
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,390
You go in and sit down in the dark.

200
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,730
There are pictures on the wall.

201
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,450
They move.

202
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,500
They tell a story...'

203
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,160
'Very funny, ha ha,' said Giles.

204
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,290
Willow and the Watcher Diaries were back at
the door.

205
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,560
'OK, Giles, I gotta go.

206
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,680
Bye.'

207
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,320
She ran from the room.

208
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
* * *

209
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,470
Buffy and Willow sat in the girls' room.

210
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,870
They read the Watcher Diaries.

211
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,410
'Wow!' said Buffy.

212
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,330
'Look at her.'

213
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,730
There was a picture of a beautiful woman in
a long dress.

214
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,000
'Who is she?' asked Willow.

215
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,990
'It doesn't say.

216
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,980
But look!

217
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,950
It says 1775 here.

218
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,050
Angel was 18 then.'

219
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,960
'She looks very rich,' said Willow.

220
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,900
Buffy thought about Angel in 1775.

221
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,130
He was young then, and a man, not a vampire.

222
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,460
'She knew him in the best part of his life.

223
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,950
Lucky woman!'

224
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,360
she said.

225
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,650
'No!' said Willow.

226
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,840
'Life was terrible for women then.'

227
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,320
The girls' room door opened.

228
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,880
'Well, Buffy, you left poor Angel alone last
night.

229
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,680
' It was Cordelia.

230
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,380
'He's so nice.

231
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,460
But what's his story?

232
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,610
I never see him around.'

233
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,380
'Not during the day,' said Willow.

234
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,150
Cordelia looked at Willow.

235
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,800
'He's a vampire.

236
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,590
Didn't you know?'

237
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,390
'A nice vampire?!

238
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,200
I don't believe you.

239
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,950
You can't keep me away from Angel with stupid
stories like that.

240
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:13,130
Maybe you're the Vampire Slayer, Buffy, but
I'm the Man Slayer around here.'

241
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,130
* * *

242
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,540
'It's so busy in here.

243
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,350
You can't move!'

244
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,510
shouted Buffy to Willow.

245
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,050
They were in Ethan's Costume Shop.

246
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,540
Most of Sunnydale's children were there too.

247
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,270
'But it's better than Party Town!'

248
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,500
Willow shouted back.

249
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,590
Ethan's was new.

250
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,110
'I've got a ghost costume.'

251
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,810
'And I'm getting some soldier clothes and
a gun,' said Xander.

252
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,090
'Halloween isn't my...'

253
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,460
Buffy stopped.

254
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,510
'Hey!

255
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,190
Look at that.'

256
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,680
Willow and Xander followed Buffy to the back
of the shop.

257
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,710
There they saw a long, red dress.

258
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,920
'It's the dress in the Watcher Diaries,' said
Buffy.

259
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,190
'From eighteen-seventy-something.'

260
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,250
'1775,' said Willow.

261
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,460
She remembered these things.

262
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,760
'I want it,' said Buffy, quietly.

263
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,480
Suddenly there was a man next to them.

264
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,620
It was Ethan Rayne and this was his shop.

265
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,660
'Please,' he said to Buffy.

266
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,000
He took the dress and put it against her.

267
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,020
'Ah!

268
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,050
Beautiful.'

269
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:46,430
The dress changed Buffy from a pretty girl
into a very beautiful woman.

270
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,780
'Wow!'

271
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,470
thought Buffy.

272
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,230
'Wow!' said Willow arid Xander together.

273
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,000
Buffy woke up.

274
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,640
'I'm sorry,' she said.

275
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,070
'It's too expensive.'

276
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,350
'No, no,' said Ethan.

277
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,040
'Forget the money.

278
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,280
You must have it.

279
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,020
It's so right for you.'

280
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,020
'Great!

281
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,710
Thanks,' said Buffy.

282
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,820
Ethan Rayne smiled.

283
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,820
* * *

284
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,070
The old building was empty.

285
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,120
No one lived or worked there now.

286
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:32,270
It wasn't a nice part of town, so the vampires
liked it.

287
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,130
Spike walked up and down.

288
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,350
'Buffy,' he thought.

289
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,240
'Buffy must die.

290
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,190
Drusilla needs more blood, but that Slayer
makes it so difficult.'

291
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,270
'Spike,' someone said quietly.

292
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,440
He turned.

293
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,660
His angry face was suddenly kind.

294
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,060
It was Drusilla.

295
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,120
'Do you love me?'

296
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,130
she asked.

297
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:08,820
'Come here, my beautiful one,' he said.

298
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,120
He put his arms around her weak body.

299
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,150
'Buffy's going to die soon, my love,' he said.

300
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:22,080
'Then you can drink all the blood in Sunnydale.

301
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,140
And you can be strong again.'

302
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,330
'Something is going to happen.

303
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,800
I can see it.

304
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,220
Buffy is going to be weak.'

305
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,980
'What do you mean?

306
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,940
Are there pictures in your head?'

307
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,900
Drusilla closed her eyes.

308
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,860
'Come on, my love.

309
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,860
Talk to Spike,' he said.

310
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,470
'What's going to happen to the Slayer?

311
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,760
When?'

312
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,660
'Tomorrow,' answered Drusilla.

313
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,590
'But tomorrow is Halloween.

314
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,440
Nothing happens on Halloween.'

315
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,310
'This Halloween is different.

316
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:25,330
Someone new is in town.'

317
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,380
CHAPTER THREE
The fun starts

318
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,230
Ethan's Costume Shop closed for the night.

319
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,820
But Ethan stayed in the shop.

320
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,650
He was in the back room, in long, black clothes.

321
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:50,240
In front of him there was a statue with the
face of a beautiful woman.

322
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,400
He put his hands together.

323
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:00,000
Soon there was blood on them - lots of blood.

324
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,580
He said something to the statue in an old,
dead language.

325
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:13,030
'Janus,' he cried, 'I am your son.'

326
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,310
He walked around to the back of the statue.

327
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,530
Here it had another face.

328
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:26,610
But this one wasn't beautiful - it was evil.

329
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,610
* * *

330
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,180
School finished early on Halloween.

331
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,900
Soon Buffy was in her costume in her bedroom.

332
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,660
'I'm the woman in the Watcher Diaries,' she
thought.

333
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,180
'Where are you meeting Angel?'

334
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,880
shouted Willow.

335
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,200
She was in the bathroom.

336
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,640
'Here.

337
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,470
When the trick-or-treaters go home.

338
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,370
Mum's out this evening.'

339
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,390
'Does he know about your costume?'

340
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,350
'No, he doesn't.

341
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,890
It's going to be a big surprise!

342
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,120
Now.

343
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,710
come out, Willow.'

344
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,850
'OK.

345
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,260
But don't laugh.'

346
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,800
Buffy didn't laugh.

347
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:19,010
Willow looked fantastic in one of Buffy's
tops and a very short skirt.

348
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,340
'Wow!' said Buffy.

349
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,660
'Forget Cordelia.

350
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,470
Meet Willow, the new Man Slayer.'

351
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,550
'But this isn't me.'

352
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,400
Willow wasn't very happy.

353
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,960
'It's Halloween, Willow.

354
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,610
You can be a different person at Halloween
- a new you.

355
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,520
It's just for one night.'

356
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,250
Someone was at the door.

357
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,170
'Xander's here.

358
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,700
Are you ready?'

359
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,030
'Yeah.

360
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,920
OK,' said Willow.

361
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,930
Buffy ran down and opened the door.

362
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,400
Xander pointed his gun at her.

363
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,720
'Buffy!

364
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,230
You are so beautiful!'

365
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,370
'But look at Willow!' said Buffy, and they
turned.

366
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,190
'She's... oh...'

367
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:23,039
Willow was in her costume from Ethan's...
a ghost.

368
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,039
* * *

369
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:28,700
'Let's get our little monsters,' said Xander.

370
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,890
They were at Sunnydale High.

371
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,350
There were young children in costumes everywhere.

372
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,060
Principal Snyder saw them.

373
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,790
He came over to Buffy.

374
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:47,530
Five little people with green faces and black
teeth followed him.

375
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,160
'Here's your group, Summers,' he said.

376
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,520
He didn't smile.

377
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,240
'Just bring them all back here at six o'clock.'

378
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,730
* * *

379
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,620
Children ran from house to house on the streets
of Sunnydale.

380
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,180
They shouted and laughed.

381
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:12,000
People answered their doors and looked frightened.

382
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,220
Soon it was nearly six and Buffy's group were
tired.

383
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,230
Some of them didn't like the dark.

384
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:28,750
'ОК,' she said to them, 'one more house,
and then we're going back to school.'

385
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,280
The children ran to another house.

386
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,150
'I'm enjoying this,' she thought.

387
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,160
'It's fun.'

388
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
* * *

389
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:44,000
Back at the costume shop, Ethan was ready
for his Halloween fun.

390
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,660
'Janus,' he said to the statue, 'this night
is yours.'

391
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,940
Buffy was suddenly very cold.

392
00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:00,750
In the next road, Mrs Parker came to her front
door.

393
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,160
Willow's group waited.

394
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,750
'Trick-or-treat!'

395
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,120
they shouted.

396
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,500
'Oh!'

397
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,960
Mrs Parker put her hands up.

398
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,670
'I'm so frightened!'

399
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,380
Then she smiled.

400
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,430
'What lovely children!'

401
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,410
Ethan took the statue in his hands.

402
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,850
Buffy started to feel a cold wind around her.

403
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,040
A strange green light came from the statue.

404
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,370
Ethan smiled.

405
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:38,560
'Now the fun can start.'

406
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,460
Mrs Parker looked at the trick-or-treaters.

407
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:48,040
'Well, Mr Monster,' she said to the nearest
child.

408
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,520
'What can I...

409
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
AAAARRRGH!'

410
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,700
A green hand grabbed her neck.

411
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,020
The child-monster wasn't a child now.

412
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,090
It was a monster - strong and evil.

413
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,550
'What are you doing!?

414
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,210
Stop that,' cried Willow.

415
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,540
Mrs Parker pulled the monster's hand off her
neck.

416
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,120
She ran into the house and closed the door
quickly.

417
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,060
Willow suddenly didn't feel right.

418
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,300
Her eyes closed.

419
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,490
'I'm falling,' she thought.

420
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,490
Then her body was on the floor.

421
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,010
She was dead.

422
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,010
* * *

423
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,530
Xander wasn't far away.

424
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,350
He started to feel strange, too.

425
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,559
Then he was OK.

426
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,970
But he was different.

427
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:52,770
He wasn't Xander in a soldier costume - he
was a soldier.

428
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,050
He was tall and strong.

429
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,529
His eyes were cold, and he had a gun.

430
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:01,529
* * *

431
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:03,000
Willow sat up.

432
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,400
'What happened?'

433
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,410
She walked a little.

434
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,010
Then she turned.

435
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,730
'Oh, oh!'

436
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:17,220
Her body - in its ghost costume - was still
there.

437
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:24,980
She looked at her clothes - short skirt, short
top - Willow the Man Slayer...

438
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,120
'Oh no!

439
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,330
I'm a ghost.

440
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,550
I'm Willow's ghost.'

441
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,260
She looked down the street.

442
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:41,660
There were frightened children and little
monsters everywhere.

443
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,230
Then she heard a gun.

444
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,910
'Xander!'

445
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,470
She ran to him.

446
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,640
He turned, with his gun on her.

447
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,400
He looked like Xander, but something was different.

448
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,559
'It's me.

449
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,559
Willow.'

450
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:02,440
'I don't know a Willow.'

451
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,230
He grabbed her arm, but his hand went through
her body.

452
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,230
'Hey!

453
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,780
What are you?'

454
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,320
'Xander, listen to me.

455
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,100
We're friends.

456
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,320
Something terrible is happening.

457
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:23,110
I was in a ghost costume, and now I am a ghost.

458
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:29,800
You were in a soldier costume, and now you
are a soldier.'

459
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,590
'I don't believe you.'

460
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:36,850
A little vampire ran from a house.

461
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,990
Xander pointed his gun at it.

462
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,990
'No!'

463
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,100
cried Willow.

464
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,559
'There's a little child in there.

465
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:47,800
No guns, OK?'

466
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,580
And then she saw Buffy.

467
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,320
'Buffy, are you all right?'

468
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,240
The little vampire came back.

469
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,620
It had a big monster with it this time.

470
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,040
They moved nearer.

471
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:09,410
'Buffy, what do we do?' asked Willow.

472
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,080
Buffy looked at the monsters with frightened
eyes.

473
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:32,320
And then she started to fall.

474
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,860
CHAPTER FOUR
Who's Buffy?

475
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,190
Willow looked at Buffy's body on the floor.

476
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,590
She didn't believe her eyes.

477
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,740
'Buffy?

478
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,980
Are you OK?'

479
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,080
'What?

480
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,030
Who is Buffy?' said Buffy.

481
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,100
'She's not Buffy,' Willow said to Xander.

482
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,270
'Who's Buffy?' asked Xander.

483
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:07,860
'Oh, this is fun,' said Willow.

484
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:13,540
And then to Buffy, 'What year is this?'

485
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,070
Buffy thought.

486
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,690
'1775, I believe.

487
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,360
I don't understand.

488
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,430
Who are you?'

489
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,470
'We're friends.

490
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,250
Here, take my hand.'

491
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:36,490
'Your clothes... everything... is strange,'
said Buffy.

492
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,830
'How did I come here?'

493
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,010
Willow looked at Xander.

494
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,450
'What's going to happen to us without the
Slayer?'

495
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,450
she said.

496
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:54,179
'What's a Slayer?' asked Xander.

497
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:57,590
Suddenly a monster kicked Buffy from behind.

498
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:02,170
This new Buffy didn't kick back.

499
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,260
She just screamed.

500
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,130
Xander hit the monster with his gun and it
ran off.

501
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:14,430
'Let's go into a house,' said Xander.

502
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,430
'Monster!'

503
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,510
cried Buffy.

504
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,330
'A monster!'

505
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,970
Willow and Xander turned.

506
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,050
They were ready.

507
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,580
But there wasn't a monster.

508
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,580
There was only a car.

509
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,390
'It's a car,' said Willow.

510
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,580
'What does it want?' said Buffy.

511
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,510
'What's wrong with this woman?' asked Xander.

512
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,500
'She's from 1775.

513
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,240
They didn't have cars then,' said Willow.

514
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,190
'Let's go.

515
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,530
Buffy's house is near here.'

516
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,290
Buffy and Xander followed Willow.

517
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,940
They went into Buffy's kitchen through the
back door.

518
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,020
Xander closed the door and watched at the
window.

519
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,720
'We're OK... for now.'

520
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,490
BANG, BANG, BANG!

521
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,260
'The front door!

522
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,260
Quick!'

523
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,310
Xander and Willow ran through the house.

524
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,070
'Don't open it!' said Willow.

525
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,170
'There are vampires out there.'

526
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:24,730
The sound stopped.

527
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:29,770
Willow and Xander stopped too, and waited.

528
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:34,370
Buffy came into the room and looked at a photo
of a young woman.

529
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,660
'This is just like me,' she said.

530
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,470
'It is you,' said Willow.

531
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:45,510
'Buffy, can't you remember anything?'

532
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,220
'No...

533
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,940
no.

534
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,380
I don't understand.

535
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,320
I don't wear these...

536
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,320
these...

537
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,290
Are they clothes?

538
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:00,010
I don't like this place.

539
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,990
I don't like you.

540
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,970
Where is my home?'

541
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,000
Just then a green hand came through the window.

542
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,429
It grabbed Xander's arm but he hit it with
his gun.

543
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:17,790
The thing ran away.

544
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,510
Now there was a different scream.

545
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,580
It wasn't Buffy this time.

546
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,150
Xander opened the front door and ran out.

547
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,150
'Hey!

548
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,150
Stop!'

549
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,960
called Willow.

550
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,950
Xander came back.

551
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,140
He pulled a woman in a cat costume into the
house.

552
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,390
She was dirty and there was blood on her arms.

553
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,330
It was Cordelia.

554
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,350
'What's happening?'

555
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,380
she cried.

556
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,760
'Cordelia!' said Willow.

557
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,210
'OK, now listen.

558
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,580
Your name is Cordelia.

559
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,950
You're not a cat.

560
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:02,750
You're at high school, and we're your friends...,
well...'

561
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,180
'That's nice, Willow,' Cordelia said.

562
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,320
'But I'm not stupid.'

563
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,740
'Do you know us?

564
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,940
Oh, that's fantastic,' said Willow.

565
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,460
'Er... yeah,' said Cordelia.

566
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,170
'You're a bit strange today.

567
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,510
But look at my costume.

568
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,920
Party Town isn't going to like this.'

569
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,200
'OK,' said Willow.

570
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,410
'Cordelia, you stay here with Xander and Buffy.

571
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:41,620
I'm going to see Giles.'

572
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,620
***

573
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,130
Willow didn't see Spike in the street.

574
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:49,309
He was under a tree in his long, black coat.

575
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:52,880
His vampire face was evil.

576
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,299
He looked around him and smiled.

577
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:04,510
'Well,' he said, 'this is... great!'

578
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,060
Xander and Buffy watched the streets from
the front door.

579
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:14,080
They were OK... for now.

580
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,600
Cordelia watched from a bedroom window.

581
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,940
'Oh, good,' said someone behind them.

582
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,260
'You're all right.'

583
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,810
They turned.

584
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,970
It was Angel.

585
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,780
'It's evil out there.'

586
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,950
'Who are you?'

587
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,070
they asked.

588
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,070
* * *

589
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,030
'ОК,' said Angel, 'what's happening here?'

590
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,890
He looked at Buffy's dress.

591
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:50,440
He remembered something... someone... from
long ago...

592
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,870
'Do you live here?'

593
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,530
asked Xander.

594
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,710
'No!

595
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,230
You know that.

596
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,410
Buffy...?'

597
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:05,440
This was Buffy... but not Buffy.

598
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,500
'What's up with your hair, Buffy?

599
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,070
You look... different,' he said.

600
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,830
'They don't know you, Angel.'

601
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,410
It was Cordelia.

602
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:23,340
'And everyone in the street's a monster.'

603
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,490
Then she remembered her smile.

604
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:31,600
'So, Angel, how are you?'

605
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,020
Someone turned off the lights.

606
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,890
Buffy screamed and grabbed Cordelia.

607
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,040
'Hey!' said Cordelia.

608
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,000
'Keep your hands off me!'

609
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,179
Xander turned to Angel.

610
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:46,940
'Take the girl to the kitchen.

611
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,750
Watch the door.

612
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,640
Catwoman, stay here with me.'

613
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,920
In the kitchen, the back door was open.

614
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,600
'I closed that,' said Angel.

615
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,179
He moved quietly to the door.

616
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:07,810
Buffy stayed by the wall.

617
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,169
She didn't see the vampire.

618
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:11,770
'Be careful!'

619
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:14,020
cried Angel.

620
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,830
He grabbed the vampire and kicked it into
the dining room.

621
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,730
'Get a stake!'

622
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,940
Angel shouted to Buffy.

623
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,980
He turned to her.

624
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,940
She saw Angel's face and screamed.

625
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,190
It was his vampire face - angry and terrible.

626
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,050
She ran out of the house.

627
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,169
'Buffy, no!'

628
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:38,290
shouted Angel.

629
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:44,099
The other vampire hit Angel hard.

630
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:45,099
* * *

631
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:47,700
There were a lot of books in front of Giles
and Willow.

632
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,990
'This isn't helping,' Willow said.

633
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:54,270
'What are we looking for?'

634
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,110
'OK,' said Giles.

635
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,160
'Let's think.

636
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,030
At six o'clock, everyone changed.'

637
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,490
'Right.

638
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:13,460
So now Xander's a soldier, and Buffy's a girl
from 1775.'

639
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,950
Giles looked at Willow.

640
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,830
'And you are...?'

641
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:22,040
'I'm a ghost,' said Willow.

642
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,950
Giles smiled and looked at her short skirt
and top.

643
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,890
'A ghost of...?'

644
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,530
Willow went red.

645
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,000
'You didn't see Cordelia!

646
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,780
She has cat ears and...'

647
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,842
'So Cordelia is now a cat?!'

648
00:35:38,842 --> 00:35:41,080
Willow looked at Giles.

649
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:47,790
'Wait a minute,' she said slowly.

650
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:53,020
'Cordelia isn't a cat.

651
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:58,060
She's the same old Cordelia... in a cat costume.'

652
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,780
'She didn't change, then.'

653
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,840
'No.'

654
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,369
Willow thought for a minute.

655
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:08,230
'I know!

656
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,090
Party Town!

657
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,950
That's it.

658
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,440
Her costume came from Party Town.'

659
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,320
'And you, Buffy, Xander.

660
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
Where...

661
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
?'

662
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,850
'We went to this new place,' Willow said.

663
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,850
'Ethan's.'

664
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:35,920
'Come on!' said Giles.

665
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:43,670
'Quick!'

666
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:53,310
CHAPTER FIVE
'I'm home'

667
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:58,710
'Hello?' Giles called.

668
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,250
'Is anyone in?'

669
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,390
The shop was dark.

670
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:09,200
Willow saw an open door at the back.

671
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,350
There was a statue in the room.

672
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,240
It had an evil face with green eyes.

673
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,920
'What does it mean?'

674
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,170
she asked.

675
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,160
'It's Janus,' said Giles.

676
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,290
'From an old world.

677
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:32,330
Janus has two faces - man and woman, good
and evil...'

678
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,500
'Milk and dark...'

679
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,290
Ethan was just behind them.

680
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,640
Willow and Giles turned quickly.

681
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,580
'Oh no, sorry.

682
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,550
That's chocolate.'

683
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,970
Ethan smiled at Giles.

684
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,000
'Willow,' Giles said.

685
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,640
He didn't look at her.

686
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,150
'Go to Buffy.

687
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,350
Now.'

688
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,550
'But...'

689
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,950
'Now, Willow.'

690
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,480
She turned and ran.

691
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,520
'Hello, Ethan.'

692
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,540
'Hello, Rupert, my old friend,' Ethan answered.

693
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:14,119
'This is nice.'

694
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:15,570
Giles didn't smile.

695
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,390
'I was stupid.

696
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,820
I didn't think of you.

697
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:27,180
But of course this Halloween thing is your
idea.

698
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,440
It's just like all your other plans.'

699
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,369
'Yes,' Ethan said.

700
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:36,450
'All my plans are clever.'

701
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,930
'Not clever, Ethan - evil.'

702
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:46,880
'Well, Rupert, you know all about evil, of
course.'

703
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,300
He laughed.

704
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,100
'But maybe they don't know about you here.'

705
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,830
Giles changed.

706
00:38:55,830 --> 00:39:00,020
No one in Sunnydale knew this Giles.

707
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,100
'Stop your evil, Ethan.

708
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,300
Then leave this place.

709
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,560
Never come here again.'

710
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,860
'Oooooh.

711
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,470
I'm frightened...'

712
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,310
Giles hit him.

713
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:16,359
Ethan went down hard onto the floor.

714
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:20,089
There was blood on his mouth.

715
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:21,089
* * *

716
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:27,530
Angel's vampire face changed, and he looked
like a man again.

717
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:32,210
He found Xander and Cordelia and they ran
into the road.

718
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:36,170
'Buffy, Buffy, where are you?'

719
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,860
Angel called.

720
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,910
'Let's go this way,' said Xander.

721
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:44,830
'She needs help - now,' Angel said.

722
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,490
'I know it.'

723
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,890
'Buffy's always OK,' said Cordelia.

724
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,870
'But this isn't Buffy...'

725
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,870
* * *

726
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,300
Spike watched them.

727
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,030
He had two small vampires with him.

728
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,740
'Did you hear that, my friends?

729
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,570
Drusilla was right.

730
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,900
Tonight Buffy is weak.

731
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,420
Come on.

732
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,420
We must find her first.

733
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,700
Then we can drink that lovely blood.'

734
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,700
* * *

735
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,849
Buffy was alone on a dark street in the bad
part of town.

736
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:27,850
She was very frightened.

737
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:31,490
She ran into something... someone.

738
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,680
He was big and dirty, with bad teeth.

739
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,120
'Pretty... pretty,' he said, and grabbed Buffy.

740
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,440
'Mmm,' he said.

741
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,570
'Nice.'

742
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,710
'No!'

743
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,080
cried Buffy.

744
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,950
Xander suddenly arrived.

745
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:55,109
'Hey!' he shouted, and pulled the man off
Buffy.

746
00:40:55,109 --> 00:41:00,190
Buffy screamed and ran... right into Cordelia.

747
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,780
Then Buffy saw Angel.

748
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,810
She screamed again and grabbed Cordelia.

749
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,140
'What's up with you?'

750
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,140
Cordelia cried.

751
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,770
'That man!

752
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,480
Your friend!

753
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,900
He's... he's a vampire!'

754
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,280
she screamed.

755
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,650
Cordelia smiled at Angel.

756
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,850
'She thinks... oh, forget it.'

757
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,050
Then she turned to Buffy.

758
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,050
'It's OK.

759
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,510
Angel is... a friend.

760
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,090
He likes us.'

761
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,090
'Hey!'

762
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,270
They all turned.

763
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,280
It was Willow.

764
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,340
'We gotta get out of the road,' she said.

765
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,430
'This way.'

766
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,210
Angel ran to an old building.

767
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,800
The others followed him into the building
and closed the door.

768
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,240
But Spike was just behind them, with a lot
of little vampires.

769
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,920
They kicked the door and it opened.

770
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,530
Spike came into the building.

771
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:07,200
He smiled at his little helpers.

772
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,200
* * *

773
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,640
Ethan had lots of blood on his face, but he
smiled too.

774
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,740
'How do I stop this evil?'

775
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,380
Giles asked.

776
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,600
He cleaned the blood from his hands.

777
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,460
Ethan laughed.

778
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,470
'Say "please"' Giles kicked him.

779
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,810
'OK.

780
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,150
OK!

781
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,950
B-B-Break Janus, ' said Ethan.

782
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:37,970
'B-Break the statue.'

783
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:38,970
***

784
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,190
Vampires pulled Angel and Xander away.

785
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,340
Spike turned to Buffy.

786
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,810
'My little one,' he said.

787
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,050
'Frightened.

788
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,300
Alone.

789
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,250
No one can help you now.'

790
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,859
He smiled kindly.

791
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:57,720
Then he hit her across the face.

792
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,200
'I'm enjoying this, ' he laughed.

793
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
'Buffy!'

794
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,460
Angel cried.

795
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,270
But the vampires pulled him harder.

796
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,790
Spike grabbed Buffy's head with one hand.

797
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,260
He had her arm in the other.

798
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:31,650
His long white teeth came close to her beautiful
neck.

799
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:47,830
'Hi!'

800
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,580
she said to Spike.

801
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,700
'I'm home.'

802
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,090
Spike didn't look happy now.

803
00:43:55,090 --> 00:44:00,690
Buffy was the Vampire Slayer again, and she
was very angry.

804
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,050
She kicked him and hit him.

805
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,940
Then she kicked him again.

806
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,180
'Do you know something?'

807
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,260
she said.

808
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,150
'I'm enjoying this!'

809
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:15,380
Spike hit the floor hard and didn't move again.

810
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,270
'Hey, Buff!' said Xander.

811
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,770
'We're back!'

812
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:24,440
'Do you remember anything?' asked Cordelia.

813
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,050
'Yeah, ' said Xander.

814
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,750
'It was like, "I'm here.

815
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,510
I can hear you.

816
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,200
But I can't get out.

817
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,550
" It was strange.'

818
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,230
'Are you OK?'

819
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,110
Angel asked Buffy quietly.

820
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,030
Buffy looked into his dark eyes.

821
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,460
She loved those eyes.

822
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,430
'Yeah,' she smiled.

823
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:51,240
He took her arm and they went out.

824
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,920
'Hey!' said Xander.

825
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,080
'Where's Willow?'

826
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,080
* * *

827
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,590
'What happened?' asked Willow.

828
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:04,230
She was at Mrs Parker's house in her ghost
costume.

829
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:09,830
'Well, I'm in my own body again, ' she thought.

830
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:13,840
'That feels better.'

831
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,840
* * *

832
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,160
Buffy was in Buffy clothes with Buffy hair
again.

833
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,900
She was at home, with Angel.

834
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,130
She sat down next to him.

835
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,480
'I like this Buffy, ' he said.

836
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,320
'I hated the girls in the old days.'

837
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,180
'Did you?'

838
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,980
'They were boring.

839
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,780
I want someone...

840
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,780
exciting.'

841
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,710
He moved closer.

842
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,710
'Interesting.'

843
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,790
'Oh yeah?'

844
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,530
'Strong.'

845
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,970
Then he took her in his arms.

846
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,080
And Buffy smiled.

847
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,229
'This feels right, ' she thought.

848
00:45:53,229 --> 00:45:54,229
* * *

849
00:45:54,229 --> 00:46:00,930
The next day, Giles was in Ethan's empty shop.

850
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,340
He walked around slowly.

851
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,310
Suddenly he saw some paper.

852
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:09,080
There were words on it.

853
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,490
'See you soon,' he read.

854
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:14,640
Giles looked up.

855
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,200
His eyes were hard and cold.

856
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:17,800
- THE END -
