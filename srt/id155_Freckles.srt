CHAPTER ONE
My Big Teenage Problem

2
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:14,250
I hated my freckles when I was young.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,360
Every day I looked in the mirror and thought,
'Look at them!

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,800
They're getting bigger!

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,119
When I'm older they'll be one BIG freckle,
all over me!'

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,619
At school, the other little children in my
class laughed at me and my freckles.

7
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,080
'Hello, Freckle-face!'

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,550
they shouted.

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:41,879
But when I was a teenager, it all got worse.

10
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,010
My freckles were my Big Teenage Problem.

11
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,089
Why did I think that?

12
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:56,790
Because one lunchtime, I went to the school
library and started to look for a book.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,490
Suddenly, I heard a conversation between two
boys.

14
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,250
'So who do you think is pretty?'

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,100
one said.

16
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,640
'Donna Marshall?' said the other boy.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,389
My ears went - DING!

18
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:14,689
- Because Donna's my best friend.

19
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:18,619
'Yes!' said the first boy.

20
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:20,200
'Susie Carpenter?'

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,210
My ears went - DING!

22
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,130
- Again, because that's me.

23
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,979
'Great legs...' began the first boy.

24
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:36,360
I thought, 'That's a good start, but don't
talk about the freckles!

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,880
Please don't talk about the freckles.'

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,299
'... but I don't like the freckles.'

27
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,979
'Oh, no!'

28
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,670
I thought.

29
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,079
I wanted to run away and cry.

30
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,249
'Perhaps that will wash my freckles away,'
I thought.

31
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:55,600
Donna is pretty, of course.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:06,600
She has it all: pretty hair, blue eyes, nice
teeth - and no freckles!

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,259
Boys fall down at her feet when she walks
past them.

34
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:17,440
She can go out with any boy - and she goes
out with a lot of them!

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,800
When she gets bored with somebody, she says
goodbye to him.

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,560
Then she turns to the next boy.

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,470
That was Donna's life.

38
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,440
A lot of young men, and they happily did everything
for her.

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,330
I only had freckles!

40
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,570
I was very unhappy in those days.

41
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,350
But not now.

42
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,930
Now I'm quite happy with my freckles.

43
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,500
So what changed things?

44
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
I'll tell you...

45
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,021
It was lunchtime in the Dining Room, and I
was with Donna.

46
00:02:55,021 --> 00:03:01,370
Suddenly, Donna said, 'A boy over there is
looking at us.'

47
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,620
'Looking at you, you mean,' I said.

48
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,740
'What boy?'

49
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,020
'I don't know,' she said.

50
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,730
'I never saw him before now.'

51
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,570
I started to turn my head.

52
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,800
'Don't look!'

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,650
Donna said quickly.

54
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,500
'He'll see you!

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,540
Look at him when he's not looking.'

56
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,980
'Donna, I have to look at him,' I said.

57
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,290
'Or how will I know when he's not looking?

58
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,340
What's wrong?

59
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,550
Will he run away when he sees me?'

60
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,820
'OK, look at him,' said Donna.

61
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,700
'But be careful.

62
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,430
We don't want him to think, "So they're interested
in me!"

63
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,280
Go and get a glass of water.'

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,510
'I've got some water,' I said.

65
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,650
'Go and get another glass!'

66
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,260
she said.

67
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,860
'You can look at him on the way.

68
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,760
He's sitting alone, near the door.'

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,070
I went for some more water and looked at the
boy.

70
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,990
He smiled at me.

71
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:15,480
I smiled back and he blushed.

72
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,930
When I got back to the table, Donna nearly
pulled me down into my chair.

73
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,639
'Do you know him?'

74
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,639
she asked.

75
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,240
'His name's Jack,' I said.

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,770
'He came to the school at the beginning of
term.

77
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,830
We're in the same class for History.'

78
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,449
'He's got a nice face!' said Donna.

79
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:36,729
Her eyes were excited.

80
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:38,919
Did he?

81
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,330
Did Jack have a nice face?

82
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,660
I thought about it.

83
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,740
I said, 'But he's not handsome.

84
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,039
Is he?'

85
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,990
'No,' said Donna.

86
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:57,560
'But he isn't handsome in a really nice way.

87
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,020
Do you know him well?'

88
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,750
'Not very well,' I said.

89
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,669
'I say hello to him.'

90
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:08,240
'Who's he going out with?' asked Donna.

91
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
'Nobody!'

92
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,319
I said.

93
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,080
'He only came here at the beginning of term!'

94
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,720
Donna's brain started to work - fast.

95
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,800
'You've got History last lesson today,' she
said.

96
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,689
'Talk to him after the lesson.

97
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,249
Give me time, and I'll find you.'

98
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:31,810
I said, 'Wait a minute!

99
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,590
Excuse me?

100
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,889
Aren't you Donna Marshall?

101
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:38,800
Aren't you going out with Steve Bridges?'

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,699
'Not really,' said Donna.

103
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:48,300
I said, 'Last week you said, "Steve's wonderful,
Susie!'"

104
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,500
'That was last week,' said Donna.

105
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,699
'I like Steve, of course, but...'

106
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:04,719
I knew two things: Donna was bored with Steve
('Goodbye, Steve!').

107
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:10,639
And Jack was next, because... well...

108
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,610
Donna always got her man.

109
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,800
So after the history lesson, I put my books
in my bag slowly.

110
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,680
And when Jack went past my table on his way
out, I went after him.

111
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,259
I said, 'Jack?'

112
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:30,860
He turned and saw me.

113
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,409
He blushed again.

114
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:37,490
I thought, 'He's very shy.'

115
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,800
I said, 'Hi, I'm Susie!'

116
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,870
'I know you are,' said Jack.

117
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,490
'Did you want something?'

118
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,590
'Do you like it here?'

119
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,020
I asked, because I couldn't think of anything
more interesting.

120
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,949
'Is it difficult at a big school when you
don't know anybody?'

121
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:01,449
'It's OK,' he said.

122
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,050
'Everybody's friendly.

123
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,249
And it smells right.'

124
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:07,249
'What?'

125
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:08,659
I said.

126
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:12,479
Jack smiled - a nice smile!

127
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,490
He said, 'My last school was near a farm.

128
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,270
The smell was bad!

129
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,930
We had to shut the windows, summer and winter.'

130
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,469
'So you're a country boy?'

131
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:25,469
I said.

132
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:26,969
'No,' he said.

133
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:29,900
'My school was in Basingstoke.'

134
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,370
'Oh, Basingstoke!'

135
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,840
I said.

136
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,190
'You know it?' he said.

137
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,180
'No,' I said.

138
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,139
'Is it a nice place?'

139
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:43,729
'It's OK.'

140
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:48,659
He looked at me strangely, but I couldn't
stop now.

141
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,819
Where was Donna?

142
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,059
I said, 'Are there any cinemas in Basingstoke?'

143
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:57,050
'Er, yes,' he said.

144
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,680
'Did you see the film -?' I began.

145
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,189
Then I saw Donna.

146
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,169
She came to us and smiled.

147
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,169
She said, 'Hi, Susie!'

148
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:08,509
I said, 'Hi!

149
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,909
Donna, this is Jack.

150
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:13,319
Jack, this is Donna.'

151
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,659
Donna gave him a big smile.

152
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:20,259
Her smile usually makes men weak in the legs.

153
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:24,300
Jack put out his hand and said, 'Hello, Donna.

154
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,639
Nice to meet you.'

155
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,600
Usually makes men weak in the legs.

156
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,319
But not this time!

157
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,740
After a minute, Donna tried again.

158
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,039
She gave another smile and put her hand in
Jack's hand.

159
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,240
I thought, 'Why isn't he falling at her feet?'

160
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,970
I left them.

161
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,620
She could do the work now.

162
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,399
Donna phoned me at six o'clock.

163
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,940
She wasn't happy.

164
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,370
She said, 'That Jack - really!'

165
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,820
'What's wrong with him?'

166
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,820
I asked.

167
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,440
'I could only get about six words out of him!'

168
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
she said.

169
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,639
'He was all right when he talked to me,' I
said.

170
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,639
'Perhaps he was shy.'

171
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,620
'He's slow,' she said.

172
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,490
'I want to go out with him but he didn't ask
me.'

173
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:26,810
I thought, 'Donna was alone with a boy for
more than five minutes, and he didn't ask

174
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,529
her out!

175
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,880
What's wrong with her!'

176
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,940
I said, 'I think he's shy.

177
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,550
He blushes easily.'

178
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,959
'I'll try something different next time,'
said Donna.

179
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,061
'What does he like to do?

180
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:44,061
What doesn't he like?'

181
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:48,690
'I don't think he likes farms,' I said.

182
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,440
'Farms?' said Donna.

183
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,600
'Who wants to talk about farms?

184
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,120
Does he like dancing?

185
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,019
Does he like the cinema?

186
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:59,220
You'll have to ask him.'

187
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,622
'Why don't you ask him?'

188
00:10:01,622 --> 00:10:04,440
I said.

189
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,100
Donna did this big sigh down the phone.

190
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,220
She said, 'Oh, Susie!

191
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,000
You don't know anything about boys.'

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,339
She was right, I didn't.

193
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,880
And it was because of the freckles.

194
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,190
CHAPTER TWO
Cats and Poems

195
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,120
Next day, when we had lunch in the 'Dining
Room'.

196
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,040
Donna watched Jack all the time.

197
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,430
When he was ready to leave, Donna said, 'Now,
Susie!

198
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,019
Go after him, quickly!'

199
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:44,529
'But I'm having my lunch, ' I said.

200
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:45,660
'Forget lunch!'

201
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,790
she said.

202
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,449
'Food makes you fat.'

203
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,769
I said, 'OK, OK!

204
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:52,850
I'm going!'

205
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,269
Can you think of a better friend than me?

206
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:00,459
Do your friends go without their lunch for
you?

207
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,949
I found Jack near the tennis courts.

208
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:04,650
I said, 'Jack!

209
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,650
Hi!'

210
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:10,889
'Hi, Susie,' said Jack, and he blushed again.

211
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:16,330
I said, 'So what do you like, Jack?'

212
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,450
'Pardon?' he said.

213
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,740
'Do you like sports?

214
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,880
Tennis?'

215
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
I said.

216
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,620
Jack laughed - a nice laugh!

217
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,620
He said, 'No, I'm not very good at sports.

218
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,779
I like reading, or computer games.'

219
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:35,110
'Do you like dancing?'

220
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,790
I asked.

221
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,449
'Sometimes,' he answered.

222
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,829
'When I'm dancing with the right girl.'

223
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:45,889
We didn't speak for a minute.

224
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:47,220
Jack looked at me.

225
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,350
'His eyes aren't brown, they're green,' I
thought.

226
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,850
After a time, I said, 'What other things do
you like?'

227
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,190
'Cats,' said Jack.

228
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,530
'We've got three.

229
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,660
They're good for stress.'

230
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,660
I didn't understand.

231
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,769
I said, 'Cats give you stress?'

232
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,259
A nice laugh again.

233
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:13,870
Jack said, 'No.

234
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,079
They stop it.'

235
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,220
He smiled at me for a minute.

236
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,839
'And what does Susie like?'

237
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,149
I wasn't ready for this.

238
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:28,269
I had to ask Jack questions.

239
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:33,480
I said, 'Oh, you know.

240
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Reading, music.

241
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
I write poems -'

242
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,770
'You write poems?'

243
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,370
'Yes,' I said.

244
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:47,040
'When I was young, my school teacher told
me, "That's a good poem, Susie!".

245
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,879
After that, I never stopped writing them.'

246
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,009
Jack's eyes were open wide.

247
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:55,860
He said, 'That's strange!

248
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,399
I write poems too!'

249
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,050
'A lot of people do, Jack,' I said.

250
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:05,269
'The library's got a lot of books of poems
in it.'

251
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:08,210
Nice laugh Number Three.

252
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,860
Jack said, 'You'll have to show me yours one
day.'

253
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,990
Conversation with Jack was easy, so I talked.

254
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,310
And talked.

255
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,940
Then I saw the time and said, 'Sorry, are
you bored?'

256
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,120
'No, I'm not bored,' he said.

257
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,700
'I enjoyed listening.'

258
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,350
His face went red again.

259
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,940
He looked at the floor and said, 'Can we do
it again someday?'

260
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,100
I said, 'Yes, of course!

261
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,610
I'll see you.'

262
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,339
'See you,' he said.

263
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:45,810
I was nearly late for my class.

264
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,320
Donna wasn't happy.

265
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,570
She said, 'Where were you?'

266
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,709
'With Jack,' I said.

267
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,430
'All this time?'

268
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,500
'It was a long conversation,' I said.

269
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,899
'He's interesting.'

270
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,089
But Donna didn't want to know that.

271
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,189
She said, 'Tell me about him.

272
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:09,060
What does he like?'

273
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,360
'He doesn't like sports,' I said.

274
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,620
'He likes cats, he writes poems -'

275
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,160
'Poems?' said Donna.

276
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,990
'Yes,' I said.

277
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,509
'You know - poems - a lot of words...'

278
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:24,089
'OK, OK!

279
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:27,420
I know about poems!' said Donna.

280
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,350
'And he likes dancing,' I told her.

281
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,610
Donna smiled.

282
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,759
It wasn't a pretty smile.

283
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,459
Cats and poems weren't very useful to her,
but dancing...

284
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:42,420
'Does he?'

285
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,379
she said.

286
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:47,310
'Now that's interesting!'

287
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,370
Next day, Donna wanted to look for Jack.

288
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,640
She took me with her.

289
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,199
We found him outside the English classroom.

290
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:00,189
Donna said, 'Hello, Jack!'

291
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:03,170
Jack said, 'Hello... er...?'

292
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,149
'Donna,' said Donna.

293
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:08,040
'Sorry!' he said.

294
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,890
'I can never remember names!'

295
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,730
Strange - Jack didn't blush when Donna talked
to him.

296
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,160
Donna said, 'Susie tells me you like dancing.'

297
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,360
'Er... well..." said Jack.

298
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,270
'There's a disco at school on Friday night,'
said Donna.

299
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,160
'Are you going to it?'

300
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
'Er -'

301
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,660
'I'll be there,' said Donna.

302
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,660
'Will you?' said Jack.

303
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,640
'I love dancing,' said Donna.

304
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,589
'Oh?' said Jack.

305
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:46,830
This wasn't easy for Donna.

306
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,070
'Perhaps I'll dance with you.

307
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,320
Ask me nicely,' she said.

308
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,060
'That's very kind of you,' said Jack.

309
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:03,610
'But I think my parents are planning something
for Friday.'

310
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,579
Was Donna angry on the walk home?

311
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:08,160
She was!

312
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,190
She said, 'Is it Jack, or is it me?

313
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,529
Am I suddenly ugly?'

314
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:18,839
'No,' I answered.

315
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,690
'Donna, he's shy.'

316
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,899
'He's not shy with you!'

317
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:22,899
she said.

318
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,560
'I'm not the beautiful, famous Donna!'

319
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,879
I said.

320
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,160
'Listen, give him some time.'

321
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,749
'I can't,' she said.

322
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:34,990
'Why not?'

323
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,230
I asked.

324
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,350
'I finished with Steve last night.

325
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,110
Who am I going to go to the disco with?

326
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,600
I can't stay at home when my friends are having
a good time.

327
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,499
You have to help me.'

328
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:50,470
'I do?'

329
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,470
I said.

330
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,670
'Yes, you do,' she said.

331
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,600
'Tomorrow, Jack will have to ask me to the
disco.

332
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,800
Say that to him.

333
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,500
And you think I'll say yes.'

334
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:08,449
I said, 'Why don't you ask him?

335
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:09,980
It's easier.'

336
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,980
'No!'

337
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,270
cried Donna.

338
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,559
'That's no good.

339
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,839
Perhaps he'll say no!'

340
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,600
'So what's the problem?'

341
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,299
I asked.

342
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:26,569
'Well, then I'll be unhappy and 'he'll think,
"Oh, she likes me!'"

343
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,600
she said.

344
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,470
'But you do like him!'

345
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,929
I said.

346
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:37,210
'Yes, but I don't want him to know that,'
she said.

347
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,370
'Please, Susie!'

348
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,690
'All right,' I said.

349
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,710
You can't say no to Donna.

350
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,260
When you say no, she's angry and unhappy for
days!

351
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,159
It's easier to say yes, OK.

352
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:00,930
I said, 'You don't usually try as hard as
this, Donna.

353
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,630
Why this time?

354
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,330
Why with Jack?'

355
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:15,180
Donna sighed and said, 'I like to win.'

356
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,710
CHAPTER THREE
The Phone Call

357
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,559
When I got home, I went up to my room.

358
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,140
I started my homework.

359
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,590
After five minutes, I heard the phone.

360
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,240
I thought, 'Donna!

361
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,539
What is it now?

362
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,380
Doesn't she like Jack now?

363
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,380
Are the colour of his eyes wrong?'

364
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,710
But when I answered the phone, it wasn't Donna.

365
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,100
Somebody said, 'Can I talk to Susie, please?'

366
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,030
'You're talking to her,' I said.

367
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,710
'Oh, hi, Susie!

368
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,490
It's Jack.'

369
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,490
Really?

370
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:01,140
What did Jack want?

371
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,559
Jack said, 'I hope you aren't angry.

372
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,830
I found your number in the phone book.'

373
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,050
'That's fine,' I said.

374
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,840
'Do you want to talk to me about something?'

375
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,330
Then I thought, 'Of course he wants to talk
to me!

376
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,670
He's on the phone!

377
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,670
Why did I say that?'

378
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,320
Jack said, 'Yes.

379
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,940
Er, I'd like your advice.'

380
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,419
This was new.

381
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:36,110
People didn't usually ask for my advice.

382
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,400
I said, 'OK, what is it?'

383
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,320
He didn't speak for a minute.

384
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,870
Then he said, 'There's a girl at school.

385
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:54,260
I like her very much, but I can't tell her.

386
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,390
I talked to her two or three times.

387
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,480
I think she likes me.

388
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,190
But am I right?

389
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,980
How do I know?'

390
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,429
I thought, 'Donna!

391
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:10,480
It has to be Donna.

392
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,429
He does like her.'

393
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:18,760
I said, 'Do I know this person?'

394
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,030
'Er, yes,' said Jack.

395
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,140
I said, 'What's the problem?

396
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,929
Tell her.'

397
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:30,120
'I tried,' he said.

398
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,690
'I can't say the words.

399
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:39,030
I wrote some poems about her, but I didn't
give them to her.'

400
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,590
'Give Donna a poem and she'll put it on her
bedroom wall.

401
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:50,299
Then she'll laugh at it,' I thought.

402
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:51,530
I said, 'Jack, don't be shy.

403
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,090
The girl likes you very much.

404
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,380
I know it.

405
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,100
See her and tell her.'

406
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,750
'Can't I do it on the phone?' he said.

407
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,750
'No!'

408
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,970
I said.

409
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,870
'You have to see her and tell her.

410
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,870
Don't be afraid.'

411
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,049
'OK,' he said.

412
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:15,530
Jack wasn't happy about the idea.

413
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:20,980
I could hear that, so I tried to help.

414
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,250
I said, 'That disco - can't you go?'

415
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,610
Jack sighed.

416
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,500
'Yes, I can.

417
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,750
I said all that about my parents because -'

418
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,809
I said, 'Ask her to go with you.

419
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:37,809
Tomorrow.

420
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:38,809
She'll say yes.

421
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:39,809
I know she will.'

422
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:42,391
'Susie, I -'

423
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:46,330
'Sorry I have to go now,' I said.

424
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,059
'I'm really busy.

425
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,679
See you tomorrow, and don't be afraid.

426
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:51,679
OK?'

427
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,679
'OK,' he said.

428
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,690
'Thank you for your help.

429
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,690
Goodbye!'

430
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,690
'Goodbye!'

431
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,360
I said.

432
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,640
I put the phone down quickly, before I started
to cry.

433
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,740
'Oh, Jack!'

434
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,740
I thought.

435
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,290
'Why Donna?

436
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:13,340
Why is it always Donna?

437
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,630
Why does she always get the boys?'

438
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,640
I didn't phone Donna then.

439
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,860
I didn't tell her about Jack and the disco.

440
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,850
I didn't want to talk to her.

441
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,340
Suddenly, I understood something.

442
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,710
When I went out with Donna, boys didn't see
me.

443
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,290
They looked at Donna and they talked to Donna.

444
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,250
They smiled at Donna.

445
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,970
And me?

446
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,930
They didn't see me.

447
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,919
And Donna always wanted me to do things for
her.

448
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:50,710
Get this, Susie.

449
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,909
Get that.

450
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:54,429
Tell somebody this, Susie.

451
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:55,940
Tell somebody that.

452
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,270
Say sorry to him for me, Susie.

453
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,970
And I did it!

454
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:07,320
I did it because Donna was beautiful, and
I...

455
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,580
...And I had freckles.

456
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,980
It wasn't Donna, it was the freckles.

457
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:21,340
Nobody looked past my freckles and saw the
person under them.

458
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,530
I went back to my room and did my homework.

459
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:31,350
You don't have to think about anything when
you're doing homework.

460
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:36,929
CHAPTER FOUR
Freckles are Great!

461
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:40,990
Next morning I didn't tell Donna about Jack's
phone call.

462
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:46,950
I was quiet all morning, and I tried to stay
away from everybody.

463
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,720
I had History, but I left quickly after the
lesson.

464
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,399
I didn't want to talk to Jack.

465
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,840
At lunchtime, I went for a walk.

466
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,539
I was unhappy.

467
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,399
Why?

468
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:04,960
I didn't really know.

469
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,350
I bought some fruit from a shop.

470
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,919
Then I sat down and ate it.

471
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,279
When I finished it, I looked at my watch.

472
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,410
I had to go back.

473
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:23,600
'Donna will be happy now, because she's going
to the disco with Jack,' I thought.

474
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,519
'She'll tell me every little thing about it.

475
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:30,080
She'll be so happy, and she won't see my unhappy
face.'

476
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,419
I walked back to school slowly.

477
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,409
And I saw Jack!

478
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:43,100
He ran across the road and stopped in front
of me.

479
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,220
His face was red, and he was hot.

480
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,220
He said, 'Susie!

481
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,850
I couldn't find you!

482
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,850
I looked -'

483
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,980
'Well, I'm here now,' I said.

484
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,760
'Was everything all right?'

485
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,260
'What?' he said.

486
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,570
'With Donna,' I said.

487
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,110
Jack looked at me strangely.

488
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,090
'Donna?' he said.

489
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:10,360
'You asked her to the disco,' I said.

490
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,520
'And she said yes.

491
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
Right?'

492
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,210
Jack opened and closed his mouth.

493
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,570
Then he started laughing.

494
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,990
I said, 'What's funny?'

495
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:32,780
'You thought - I mean, when I spoke to you
on the phone yesterday, you - and I -' Jack

496
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,450
stopped, then started again.

497
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:44,419
He said, 'Susie, can I take you to the disco,
please?'

498
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:47,650
'Are my ears playing games with me?'

499
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,650
I thought.

500
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,640
'Did I hear him right?'

501
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
'Pardon?'

502
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
I said.

503
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,730
Jack spoke slowly.

504
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,870
'Will you come to the disco with me?'

505
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,870
'But...

506
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,940
Donna wants to go with you!'

507
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,470
I said.

508
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,230
'And I want to go with you,' he said.

509
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,230
'W-wait!'

510
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,130
I said.

511
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,019
'Is this right?

512
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:24,460
Donna wants to go to the disco with you, but
you want to go with me?'

513
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,740
'Yes,' he said.

514
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,740
'Why?'

515
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,269
I said.

516
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:34,720
And Jack said, 'Because I like you very much.

517
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,260
You're pretty... and funny.

518
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,570
And you don't think I'm strange.

519
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,570
You write poems too.

520
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:48,159
And - and I love your freckles!'

521
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,130
'You do?'

522
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,280
I said.

523
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,380
'Yes,' he said.

524
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,039
'They're lovely!'

525
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,620
'And you really want to go out with me?'

526
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,620
I said.

527
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,470
'I really do,' he said.

528
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,370
'Can I think about it?'

529
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,590
I asked.

530
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,809
'Of course!

531
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:09,200
How much time do you want?' he said.

532
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,179
'Half a minute.

533
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:12,179
Yes!'

534
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,650
I said.

535
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,810
He laughed, and I laughed with him.

536
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,090
Did I walk to the classroom?

537
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,400
Were my feet on the ground?

538
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,549
Perhaps they were.

539
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,770
Or did I fly?

540
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,179
I don't know.

541
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,399
I thought, 'He likes me!

542
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,470
He likes me!

543
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,299
I'm wonderful, I'm beautiful, I'm great!'

544
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:38,909
And then I saw Donna.

545
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:43,250
I thought, 'Oh, no!

546
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,049
What am I going to tell her?

547
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:47,620
How?

548
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,190
When?'

549
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,360
In the end, it was easy.

550
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:58,230
When we 'walked home after school, Donna said,
'It's strange.

551
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,230
Jack didn't ask me out.

552
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,590
Did you tell him?'

553
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,909
She was angry with me.

554
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:11,080
She didn't say, 'It was your job, and you
didn't do it'.

555
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,240
But she thought it.

556
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,500
And now I was angry.

557
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:22,100
I said, 'No, Donna, I didn't tell him.'

558
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,050
Donna made an ugly face.

559
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,030
'Right!' she said.

560
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,809
I'll never do anything for you!

561
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:30,620
So don't ask me!'

562
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:36,960
'I didn't ask him because he's taking a girl
to the disco,' I said.

563
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
'Who?'

564
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
she asked.

565
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,850
'Me,' I said.

566
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,350
Donna stopped.

567
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,261
She looked at me, and her mouth fell open.

568
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:45,261
'Pardon?'

569
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:48,710
And I enjoyed telling her.

570
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,950
'Yes,' I said.

571
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,789
'He liked me, but he didn't tell me.

572
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:53,789
He was too shy.'

573
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:55,030
I smiled.

574
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,940
'He likes freckles.'

575
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,860
Donna said, 'But-but-but-!'

576
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,409
Then she stopped and started again.

577
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:08,039
'There was something strange about that boy.

578
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,220
I knew it!'

579
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,470
she said.

580
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,510
'Why?'

581
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,510
I said.

582
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,770
'Because he wants to take me to the disco,
and not you?'

583
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,460
'Oh, that's not important to me!'

584
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
she said.

585
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,169
'I didn't really want to go with him.

586
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:24,080
It was only a game.

587
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,970
I like playing games with boys.'

588
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,970
'Wrong!'

589
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,970
I shouted.

590
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,380
'You wanted Jack!'

591
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,639
'No, I didn't!'

592
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:32,850
she shouted.

593
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,960
'Yes, you did!'

594
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,519
Donna made an ugly face again.

595
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,380
'Well, go out with Jack!'

596
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,380
she said.

597
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,679
'I hope you have a nice time.'

598
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,549
She said, 'nice time'.

599
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:51,539
But she meant, 'I hope you break your legs'.

600
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,470
I said, 'Tell me, Donna.

601
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,929
You're jealous!

602
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:56,929
Right?'

603
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,620
'No, I'm not jealous!'

604
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,190
she said.

605
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:03,409
But she turned and walked away.

606
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:06,360
'Donna wants me to feel bad,' I thought.

607
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,100
'But I won't!

608
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,430
Donna's not going to do that to me now.

609
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,260
She knows something important, and I know
it too.

610
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,740
A beautiful face isn't everything!

611
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:27,150
And I can't feel sorry for her because - because
it's funny!'

612
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,330
I started laughing.

613
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:33,710
And I laughed and laughed.

614
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:38,670
I did go to the disco with Jack, and we had
a wonderful time.

615
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,679
Now we're great friends.

616
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,290
And he doesn't blush when he looks at me!

617
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,549
And Donna?

618
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,070
Donna doesn't speak to me.

619
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:53,080
When I try to talk to her, she walks away.

620
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,860
But she'll talk to me again one day, because
we are good friends, really.

621
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,290
But things will be different then.

622
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,980
Oh, yes... and freckles are great!

623
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,309
- THE END -
