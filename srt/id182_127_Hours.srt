00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,040
PROLOGUE

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,280
You are going to die.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,880
I hear the voice in my head. 
I call it my first voice.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,200
It always comes after I've made some kind of 
mistake. Its words never help, they just make  

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:29,920
me feel bad. So I wait for the second voice. Its 
words are calm and sensible and nearly always help  

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:38,320
me. I wait, but tonight the second voice doesn't 
come. There is only silence, darkness and cold.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:47,360
In the first days, the second voice always came. 
It stopped me feeling sad, angry, or afraid.  

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,000
It gave me ideas. It showed me things.  

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,640
It brought me hope. I believed I could be free 
again. But, slowly, that voice disappeared.  

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,560
My belief disappeared with it. Now there 
is only the first voice. It says the same  

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,280
thing over and over again. Finally, I must 
accept the truth: I am going to die.

CHAPTER ONE

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,880
'The most beautiful place on Earth'

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,040
It is Saturday, April the 26th, 
2003. My name is Aron Ralston.  

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm biking and hiking in Canyonlands National 
Park in southeast Utah, USA. Edward Abbey,  

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,480
one of my favourite writers, described it 
as 'the most beautiful place on Earth'.  

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,920
Right now, with the sun on my back 
and the wind in my hair, I agree.

19
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,240
Today is the third day of an activity holiday.  

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,800
It started on Thursday when I went climbing 
and skiing on Mount Soplis with my friend,  

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:06,880
Brad. Yesterday, I biked the Slick Rock Trail, 
alone. It's not very long - only a little  

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,240
over nineteen kilometres - but it's one of 
the most difficult bike trails in the US.  

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,520
Today, my plan is to hike through Blue John and 
Horseshoe Canyons after biking to the trail.  

24
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,640
I'll leave my bike at the end of the 
trail and hike back to the carpark.  

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,880
I'll drive over in the truck 
and collect the bike later.

26
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,840
After that, I'll drive to Goblin Valley, 
about eighty kilometres north of here.  

27
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,800
My friends are having a party there. I 
hope I get some sleep because tomorrow  

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,200
I want to hike the most popular trail 
in southern Utah - Little White Horse.

29
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,040
I plan to spend the whole of Monday 
biking along the White Rim Trail.  

30
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,880
The trail forms a rough circle of 175 kilometres.  

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,040
It's not difficult and I should be able to finish 
in about eighteen hours. By Monday evening,  

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,240
I'll be back in Aspen, Colorado. Aspen is famous 
for its mountains and the countryside around it.  

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,080
It's a popular place for skiing. I live there and 
I work for Ute Mountaineer, a sports equipment  

34
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,200
shop. Leona, one of the people I live and work 
with, is having a goodbye party on Monday night.  

35
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,280
Now that winter is over, she's going 
to another town in Colorado to work  

36
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,480
as a gardener for the summer. Her party 
will be a cool way to end my trip.
 
 

37
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,360
00 hrs

38
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,440
8.45 am I arrive at the Horseshoe Canyon 
carpark early in the morning, pull my bike  

39
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,520
from the truck and lock the door. Then I check 
the time: eight forty-five in the morning.  

40
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,440
As I start cycling, I wonder how quickly 
I can get to the start of the trail.

41
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,080
I can now see the sign pointing 
to this end of the trail.

42
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:17,120
That means I've cycled thirteen kilometres 
in less than two hours. That's good. It will  

43
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,920
give me more time to finish my hike back to the 
truck. I lock my bike to a tree and start walking.

44
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,760
As I walk, I think about the history 
of the people who were here before me.  

45
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,760
One of them, Butch Cassidy, was very famous.  

46
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,920
He and his men stole horses and hid from the law 
during the last years of the nineteenth century.

47
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Since that time, the area has 
been called Robbers Roost country.

48
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,600
My climbing bag is heavy with the weight of my 
equipment. I think about my plan for the day.  

49
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,160
Blue John Canyon will be the 
most difficult part of the hike.

50
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,120
Three kilometres along the 
trail is the Big Drop Rappel.

51
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:12,720
Here, the canyon suddenly drops eighteen metres. 
The hardest part is 180 metres before this.  

52
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,760
The walls there are very narrow 
and the trail goes up and down,  

53
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,960
sharply. There are also a lot of 
very large rocks called boulders,  

54
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,880
stuck between the canyon walls. If these 
boulders move or fall, they can be dangerous.

55
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,800
But I'm not thinking of danger at the moment.  

56
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:42,560
I am excited. Today, I will finally see the Great 
Gallery. The Gallery is part of Horseshoe Canyon,  

57
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,200
and it's famous for the huge rock paintings which 
cover its walls. Some of them are more than five  

58
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:57,040
thousand years old. I should reach my truck by 
late afternoon. So far, things are going well.  

59
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:06,240
I arrived here earlier than I thought. This 
gives me a little more time to finish my trip.

60
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,280
I always get very excited when I'm about to leave 
on a trip. This means I sometimes forget things.  

61
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,720
Before starting this trip, I forgot to leave a 
message telling anyone exactly where I was going.  

62
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,320
This is one of the things my mother taught me. 
But this time, I just called a quick goodbye to  

63
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:37,920
my housemates - Brian, Joe, and Leona. Leona asked 
where I was going. I told her I was going to Utah  

64
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,200
and promised to be back for her party. 
Then I got in my truck and drove away.

65
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:52,400
I can't wait for adventure. It makes me feel 
happier than anything. It's part of who I am.

66
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,840
I'm on a high rock, looking down at the 
trail. I've stopped because I can hear voices.  

67
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:10,240
This surprises me. I had expected to be alone. 
Two young women suddenly appear below me. I feel  

68
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,600
pleased. I've spent the last eighteen hours alone. 
It will be good to have company for a while.

69
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,560
'Hi,' I call as I climb down the rock. 
The girls hadn't noticed me. They turn,  

70
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,760
looking a little nervous. I guess 
they are about twenty-five years old.

71
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,560
I smile and hold out my hand, 'My name's Aron.'

72
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,840
They smile back. 'I'm Megan,' says 
the darker girl, 'and this is Kristi.'

73
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,120
We shake hands and continue along the trail. 
As we go, we talk about our interests.  

74
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,880
We all love hiking, biking and adventures. 
For all of us, this is more important than  

75
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:06,400
earning a lot of money. They work in the same 
business, too. They work for Outward Bound,  

76
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:14,400
a sports equipment shop in Moab, Utah. Both Aspen 
and Moab are important tourist centres for hikers.

77
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,640
We are on the trail together for about five 
kilometres. At that point, there is a smaller  

78
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:30,000
canyon to the west. The west canyon goes back 
in a half-circle. The girls left their bikes  

79
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,320
at the end of it. We will say goodbye there and 
I'll continue on alone to the Big Drop Rappel.

80
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,680
We arrive just before 2.00 pm. I 
don't feel like saying goodbye.  

81
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,040
In the hour and a half we've been 
together, we've already become friends.

82
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,600
Megan feels the same. 'Why don't 
you come with us?' she asks.  

83
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,680
'We can finish the west canyon trail, go 
back to our truck and have a few beers.'

84
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,160
I like the idea, but following my plan is 
more important. I ask them to come with me.

85
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
'How far is it back to your truck?' Megan asks.

86
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
'Around thirteen kilometres.'

87
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,560
'That's too far. You won't get 
back before dark,' she says.

88
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,600
'Maybe not, but I really want 
to do the Big Drop Rappel.  

89
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,160
And I can't miss the paintings in the Great 
Gallery. I'll meet you after for a drink.'

90
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,200
We agree on a plan to meet 
and go to the party together.

91
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:50,160
Then I turn and wave goodbye. The movement is 
so easy I don't think about it. But there is  

92
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,240
something I don't know. It is the last time 
I will wave goodbye with my right hand.
 
 
 

93
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,480
CHAPTER TWO

94
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,400
The accident

95
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:08,080
The girls disappear into the west 
canyon. I am alone again. I continue  

96
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,720
walking towards the Big Drop Rappel. It seems 
strangely quiet without Kristi and Megan.  

97
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,320
I turn on my CD player and listen to a soft, 
slow song by Phish, one of my favourite bands.

98
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,400
The music is perfect for the way I feel: 
lucky, free and happy. The weather is perfect,  

99
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,440
too. It's warm and sunny with just 
a few white clouds in the sky.

100
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,760
Suddenly, my feet hit a pile of loose 
stones and I nearly fall to the ground.

101
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,160
Careful, Aron.

102
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:51,600
I listen to the voice in my head and look up 
the canyon. I can see that the trail ahead  

103
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,600
becomes more difficult. The Big Drop 
Rappel is now just under a kilometre away.

104
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,520
Twenty minutes later, I arrive at 
the most difficult part of the trail.  

105
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,840
Here, the canyon walls are a lot narrower. The 
trail rises and falls and is full of sharp rocks.  

106
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:19,280
I will have to be careful. I look up and see 
part of a tree stuck between the canyon walls.  

107
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,200
It was carried along the canyon after heavy rain.  

108
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,080
This is one of the dangers of hiking in 
canyon country. After a sudden storm,  

109
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:37,120
canyons can quickly fill with water. In seconds, 
the water can throw you against the canyon walls  

110
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,040
and kill you. That's why it's always very 
important to check the weather before canyoning.

111
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,640
Just below the tree is the first drop in 
the trail. It's only about three metres,  

112
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,080
so I won't need any equipment. There 
are plenty of holes in the rock  

113
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,120
for my hands and feet so I climb down easily.  

114
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,040
A metre from the bottom I let go and land on the 
ground. Soft sand covers the tops of my boots.  

115
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,440
From here, it would be difficult to climb back up. 
One thing is immediately clear: I can't go back.

116
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:24,320
The canyon walls become even narrower. Stuck 
between them, as far as I can see, are boulders  

117
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,760
of different sizes. It's an unusual sight. I 
stop and take a few pictures with my camera.

118
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,840
The Big Drop Rappel is now 
only about 160 metres away.  

119
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:47,200
Climbing down will be no problem. I have all 
the equipment I need in my backpack. For food,  

120
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,320
I have two burritos. I also have a full water 
bottle and an extra two litres in a CamelBak.

121
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,000
The boulders are both good and bad news. The 
good news is that I should be able to climb  

122
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,760
over many of them. This will be quicker than 
dropping on to the trail and climbing back up  

123
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,080
again. The bad news is that the boulders 
could move. I will have to be careful.

124
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,920
I manage the first few boulders without any 
problems and reach another drop. This one  

125
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,840
is about four metres down. About three metres 
from the edge of the drop is a boulder.  

126
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,520
It's about the same size as the wheel of a bus.  

127
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,200
If I climb onto it, the drop from there will be 
shorter. I chimney to the boulder quite easily.

128
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:48,000
As I stand on it, I feel something move. 
The movement stops almost immediately.  

129
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,160
It seems there's nothing to worry about. 
I lie down, put my hands in two holes on  

130
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,040
the far edge of the boulder and push my 
legs over the opposite side to jump down.

131
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,520
As most of my weight pushes on one side 
of the boulder, it makes a strange sound.  

132
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,880
Immediately I know this is trouble but 
it's too late to go back. From this point,  

133
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,280
everything seems to happen very slowly. I let 
go of the boulder and drop towards the ground.  

134
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,560
As I fall, I look up and see the 
boulder crashing towards my head.  

135
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,240
If I don't get out of the way, I'm dead. I try 
to push against the boulder with both hands.  

136
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,440
It hits my left hand hard against the canyon 
wall. I pull it back with a scream of pain.  

137
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,680
The boulder then hits my right arm and traps 
my hand against the right side of the canyon.
 
 

138
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,400
6 hrs

139
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:57,840
2.45 pm All this happens in a couple of seconds. 
I don't even notice landing on the canyon floor.  

140
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:05,600
I am so shocked I feel no pain. I just stand 
there, looking at my trapped hand in disbelief.

141
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:15,120
Stupid, Aron, stupid! When you first stood on 
the rock, it moved. That was a clear message to  

142
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,640
stay away! But you were in such a hurry to 
finish the hike you didn't stop and check.

143
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,640
The voice in my head doesn't 
help. It just makes things worse.

144
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:36,320
A terrible pain travels up my arm. I scream 
and pull hard to try and free myself. Nothing  

145
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:44,080
happens. I try again. This time I push against 
the boulder with my knees at the same time.

146
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,680
It's no good. The boulder 
is a lot heavier than I am.

147
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,840
I am stuck and there's no way out.
 
 
 

148
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,640
CHAPTER THREE

149
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,640
Three plans

150
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,200
Stop thinking about how bad the problem 
is, Aron. You need to be sensible.

151
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:12,160
The voice in my head is right. I must be 
sensible. This has to be my rule from now on.

152
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,560
The first thing I need is a 
drink. Without stopping to think,  

153
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,880
I take the water bottle from my bag and 
drink a third of it in five seconds.

154
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,480
I suddenly realise what I'm doing 
and pull the bottle out of my mouth.  

155
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,880
Already, I have broken my rule to be sensible.

156
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,960
I have no idea how long I will be here.  

157
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,760
This means that the most important 
thing of all is to save water.

158
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:50,160
Damn it, Aron! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
 
 

159
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,000
6 hrs 43 mins

160
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,160
3.28 pm It's almost forty-five 
minutes since my accident.  

161
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:06,320
I am calmer than before. For the last half hour, 
I've been thinking of my best chance of escape.  

162
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:13,760
I said I would meet Kristi and Megan after the 
hike. If I don't appear, will they go to my  

163
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,200
truck to find me? I won't be there. But will they 
realise that something is wrong and go for help?

164
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,840
The answer is probably 'no'. Kristi 
and Megan don't know me very well.  

165
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,840
They'll just think that I 
decided not to meet them.  

166
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:40,720
What about other hikers? Will they find me by 
chance? Again, the answer is probably 'no'.  

167
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,800
Very few people travel to the Great Gallery from 
this end of the trail. My friends won't worry,  

168
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:56,080
either. They weren't completely sure I was 
going to the party. Even on Monday evening,  

169
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,880
my housemates will just think I'm late getting 
back. No one will miss me until Tuesday morning.  

170
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,440
When I don't arrive for work, Brion After, 
my boss, will know that something is wrong.  

171
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,520
I am never late for work. He will 
probably call my family and they  

172
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:22,560
will tell the police that I am missing. But I 
didn't tell anyone exactly where I was going,  

173
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,600
so it will take the police days to find me. 
If I don't escape before then, I will die.

174
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,840
All of this means that I will have 
to get out of here alone. But how?

175
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,280
I can think of three possible plans. The 
first plan is to use the large knife on the  

176
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,360
multi-tool to chip at the boulder. This might 
take away enough of the rock to free my hand.  

177
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,280
The second plan is to try and lift the boulder 
using some of my equipment. The third plan is  

178
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:05,200
the worst. I could amputate my arm using the 
multi-tool. It's too soon to think of that idea.

179
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:16,160
I try plan one. I take the multi-tool from my 
climbing bag. It has two knives. One is longer  

180
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:24,560
than the other. I use the longest one, which is 
not so sharp. To free my hand, I must remove a  

181
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:31,200
piece of rock over fifteen centimetres wide and 
seven centimetres deep. That's a lot of rock.
 
 

182
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,480
10 hrs 15 mins

183
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:44,160
7.0 pm I've been chipping at the rock for almost 
three and a half hours. I stop for a drink of  

184
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,600
water. I lay the multi-tool on the boulder and 
reach for the water bottle. This time I am more  

185
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,080
careful and take only a sip. I wonder how long 
I'll be able to survive with the water I have  

186
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:06,400
left, only two-thirds of a litre. Until Monday 
night, maybe? Tuesday morning at the latest.
 
 
 

187
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,640
CHAPTER FOUR

188
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,720
Night and day

189
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,240
After Kristi and Megan left Aron, 
they got lost in the west canyon  

190
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,560
and arrived late at the 
meeting place. He wasn't there.

191
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,480
'He's probably left already,' said 
Megan, 'but he can't be far away.  

192
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,480
Let's drive around and see if we can find him.'

193
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,640
But there was no sign of Aron or his bike.  

194
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,640
'It doesn't really matter,' said 
Megan. 'We'll see him at the party.'

195
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,440
Again, she was wrong. By the 
time they reached Goblin Valley,  

196
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,960
the car park was full and there 
was nowhere to stay for the night.

197
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,640
The girls now felt very tired and decided 
not to go to the party. 'We'll drive to  

198
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,200
Little Wild Horse Canyon tomorrow morning,' 
said Megan. 'We'll probably find Aron there.'

199
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,480
Kristi agreed and they parked by 
the side of the road for the night.

200
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,480
The next morning, there was no sign 
of Aron at Little Wild Horse Canyon.  

201
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,400
All they found was a truck from Colorado 
with a bike inside and skis on the roof.

202
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,720
'That's probably Aron's truck,' said Megan.  

203
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,840
'He must be in the canyon 
already. We've missed him again.'

204
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,840
She wrote their email addresses on a piece 
of paper and left it on the truck window.

205
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,040
'Why didn't we just get his phone number?' 
Megan asked as they drove back to Moab.
 
 

206
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
15 hrs 15 mins

207
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,800
12.00 am My headlamp is on and I'm chipping at the 
boulder. I've managed to chip a space above and  

208
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:03,760
below an area of pink rock. Perhaps I can remove 
this large piece before I stop for the night.  

209
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:11,040
I will need to hit it hard. I don't want to 
break the knife, so I use a different part of  

210
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:18,080
the multi-tool. I hit the boulder as hard as I can 
and the piece of rock falls onto my trapped arm.  

211
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:26,000
I can now see some softer rock below. I chip at 
the rock for another hour and remove as much as  

212
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,400
the piece that came off before. More success, 
but my left arm hurts and I have to stop.

213
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:41,840
I take a sip of water. I have decided to do 
this every ninety minutes. I look up at the sky.  

214
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,200
It's a clear night and it's very cold.

215
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:54,640
Now that I've stopped chipping I feel cold. The 
wind is the worst. Every few minutes, it blows  

216
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,920
down the canyon and makes my body shake. I decide 
to use my climbing bag as a jacket to keep warm.  

217
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:11,120
I lay everything inside it on top of the boulder. 
Then I put the bag back on. I'm a little warmer  

218
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,600
but I need something soft to put my legs 
on. I take my rope, form it into a circle,  

219
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,760
and lay it on a rock below me. Now I can rest 
my knees instead of standing up all the time.

220
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,960
After a while, I begin to 
feel uncomfortable again.  

221
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,160
The problem is the weight on my legs. I 
decide to try and build some kind of seat.  

222
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,360
I put on my harness and rope. Then I 
tie carabiners to one end of the rope  

223
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,840
and make a kind of ball. The idea is to throw 
the rope over one of the boulders above my head.  

224
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,320
If I do it right, the ball will stick in the 
space between the boulder and the canyon wall.

225
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,600
It takes twenty-five throws before 
it lands in the right place.  

226
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:10,480
Now, will it hold my weight? I sit 
in the harness. It holds. Success!  

227
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:20,080
I feel very happy. But I'm not comfortable 
for long. I soon need to move again. I stand  

228
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,800
and chip for twenty minutes, then sit and rest 
for twenty minutes. This becomes my routine.

229
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:35,520
As morning comes, I'm not feeling too unhappy. 
This first night was not as bad as I thought.  

230
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,240
I've done quite well, but one thought still 
worries me: I haven't chipped much rock  

231
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:49,120
from the boulder. At this speed, it will 
take me 150 hours to free my trapped arm.

232
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,720
Chipping is not enough. I will 
have to think of something else.
 
 
 

233
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,720
CHAPTER FIVE

234
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,000
A sad message

235
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,920
23 hrs 30 mins

236
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:11,360
8.15 am I am feeling optimistic. The sun is 
shining into the canyon and a raven has just  

237
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,760
flown across the blue sky above my head. The 
sight and sound of the bird fills me with hope.

238
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,160
I hold my leg in the sunlight. 
It feels warm against my skin.  

239
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:33,600
But I need to do something. It's time for plan 
two. I will use my ropes, webbing and carabiners  

240
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:41,280
to try and lift the boulder and free my hand. I 
look up. There's a sharp piece of rock above my  

241
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,440
head. If I can throw the rope around this, it 
might hold everything in the right position.

242
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,840
After many tries, I finally succeed. I tie 
the other end of the rope around the boulder.  

243
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,560
But when I pull, nothing happens. Everything 
holds, but the boulder doesn't move.  

244
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,840
I put more weight on the rope, but it still 
doesn't work. The rope is not tight enough.
 
 

245
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
28 hrs 15 mins

246
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,840
1.00 pm I've spent four hours trying to 
lift the boulder, but nothing has worked.

247
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,000
Suddenly, I hear voices.

248
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,280
'Help! Help!' I shout.

249
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:35,680
I stop and listen. At first, there's 
nothing. But then I hear a sound from above  

250
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:43,440
and realise my mistake. It's just a small animal 
moving in the rock. I'd imagined it was people.

251
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,760
The sound of my voice shouting 
for help frightened me.

252
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,480
It made me feel lost and alone. I make 
a promise that I won't do it again.  

253
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,920
The optimistic feelings of earlier in the 
day have disappeared. No one is going to save  

254
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:08,960
me. That leaves only the third, and worst, 
plan: I will have to amputate my right arm.  

255
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,720
What will I need for the job? The knife, that's 
certain, but also a tourniquet to stop the blood.  

256
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,040
The plastic pipe from the 
CamelBak seems best for that.  

257
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,640
I take it off and use a carabiner to make it 
tight. It works well and I feel a bit better.

258
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,560
As soon as I put the knife against the 
skin of my arm, I feel ill. I can't do it.  

259
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,120
It would be like killing myself. I drop 
the knife and lay my head on the boulder.  

260
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:51,120
None of my plans have worked. I can't 
free my hand. I can't lift the boulder.  

261
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,960
I can't amputate my arm. My only hope is 
rescue, but I'll die before help arrives.

262
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,560
I feel angry with the boulder, but it's not the 
boulder's fault - it's mine. Everything about  

263
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:13,760
this stupid adventure was a mistake. I didn't 
tell anyone where I was going, I didn't go with  

264
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,480
Kristi and Megan to the west canyon, and I 
didn't get off the boulder when it moved.
 
 

265
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,800
30 hrs

266
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,720
2.45 pm It's exactly twenty-four 
hours since the accident.

267
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,000
I decide it's time to film a 
message for my family and friends.  

268
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,360
I place my camcorder on the boulder, 
turn it on and start speaking.

269
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:47,520
'My name is Aron Ralston. It's just after 
three o'clock on Sunday, April the 27th, 2003.  

270
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:55,440
I have been trapped in Blue John Canyon for the 
last twenty-four hours. My parents are Donna and  

271
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:03,600
Larry Ralston of Eaglewood, Colorado. If anyone 
finds this, please give it to them. Thank you.'

272
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:11,760
I describe all that has happened in the last 
two days. As I reach the end of my story,  

273
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,560
I feel very sad. I know this could be a final 
goodbye to my parents and sister, Sonja.

274
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,320
After telling them how much I love them, 
there is only one more thing to say.  

275
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,000
'Mum, Dad, Sonja - I'm sorry.'

276
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,640
I turn off the machine. All I can do 
now is wait for someone to find me.
 
 
 

277
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,880
CHAPTER SIX

278
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,560
Waiting

279
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
33 hrs 15 mins

280
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:52,720
6.00 pm My second night in the canyon is moving 
closer. Beyond that, I see no future. Escape has  

281
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,520
been impossible and I will die before anyone 
finds me. I feel strong enough to survive the  

282
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:08,320
fear of death, but not my body's need for water. 
This terrible, growing thirst will drive me crazy.

283
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,520
I now have only a quarter 
of a litre of water left.  

284
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:20,560
I have to make this last as long as possible. I 
drank at 3.15 pm, just after I finished filming.  

285
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,280
Then I missed the next drink and 
decided to save it for later.  

286
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,320
I'll drink at nine, midnight, three and six in 
the morning, but I'll take even smaller sips.

287
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,120
The mosquitoes have found me. There are 
several at my feet and some drinking the  

288
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,800
blood on the canyon wall. I kill five 
or six as they circle around my head.  

289
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,920
Can I eat them, I wonder? Even if I could, 
it wouldn't be enough to keep me alive.

290
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,160
I go back to waiting. It seems 
colder than the night before.  

291
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,000
I start chipping at the 
boulder just to keep warm.
 
 

292
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,200
36 hrs 15 mins

293
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,120
9.00 pm Night has fallen.  

294
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:16,160
The mosquitoes have gone. The sky above 
is beautiful: clear with bright stars.  

295
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,440
But clear skies mean lower temperatures. I 
must do something to cover more of my body.

296
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:32,160
I tie the camera bag around my left arm. Then 
I tie webbing around my right arm and put  

297
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:38,160
rope around each of my legs. I do the 
same for my right arm, using webbing.

298
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,840
I put rope round each leg. It looks 
funny and I can't help smiling.

299
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:53,200
I begin my routine of standing and sitting. 
Most of my body feels warmer, but I'm still  

300
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,840
shaking because my head and neck are cold. I 
decide to put the plastic rope bag over my head.  

301
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,000
I keep the far end open to let fresh air in.  

302
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,960
I lay my head against the boulder. I 
still can't sleep but at least I'm warmer.

303
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,920
The long, boring hours of 
the night pass slowly by.  

304
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:25,040
Finally, the sky grows lighter. Today, it's a 
dirty white colour. I wonder if this is cloud.  

305
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,120
Clouds at night are good because they trap the 
day's heat in the canyon, but clouds during  

306
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,280
the day are bad because the sun doesn't warm 
the air. There's also the chance of a storm.

307
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,840
Slowly the pale sky turns bright blue.  

308
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:48,960
It's going to be hot again. As always, the 
light and warm air make me want to do something.  

309
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,080
I try and lift the boulder again by 
pushing down on the rope with my feet.

310
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,520
This doesn't work either and 
I feel suddenly hopeless.  

311
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,680
What more can I do? No voice inside 
my head suggests anything useful. All  

312
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,320
I see in my mind are pictures of the food 
and drink left on the floor of my truck.

313
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,600
I think again about amputating my arm. 
I didn't try hard enough the last time.  

314
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,160
I need to be brave and try again.

315
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,640
I put on the tourniquet and make it tight.  

316
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,960
When everything is ready, I try to cut through 
the skin of my arm with the longer knife.  

317
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:41,200
I push hard but the skin doesn't break. 
Then, over the same area, I use the shorter,  

318
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:48,160
sharper knife. But even that doesn't work. 
It's still not sharp enough to do the job.

319
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,360
All I have for the time I've 
spent on this is a long red line  

320
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,720
across my right arm. I take off the 
tourniquet and go back to waiting.
 
 

321
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,760
47 hrs 30 mins

322
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:12,640
8.15 am The raven appears. I check my watch. It 
has arrived at exactly the same time as yesterday.

323
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,400
For the first time in two days,  

324
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:22,880
I need to urinate. I open my shorts and watch 
the yellow urine disappear into the sand.

325
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,360
I spend most of the day chipping, resting,  

326
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,320
and counting the minutes before 
my next drink of water.
 
 

327
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,840
54 hrs

328
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,040
2.45 pm It's the middle of the 
afternoon and time to film again.  

329
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:46,000
Filming has now become a part of my 
daily routine. I turn on the camcorder.

330
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:54,480
'Hi, everyone. It's Monday, April 
the 28th. I'm still trapped.  

331
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,440
I've been here for exactly forty-eight 
hours. That's two whole days with no  

332
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,960
sleep and very little water. I now have 
only about one-eighth of a litre left.'

333
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:16,080
I continue with a message to my sister, Sonja. 
She is getting married in the autumn. I tell  

334
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,080
her how proud I am of her and 
send her my love and best wishes.

335
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,720
I finish filming at 3.35 pm. It's strange 
but I feel the need to urinate again.  

336
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,840
This time, my second voice tells 
me not to urinate on the ground.

337
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,520
Save it, Aron. It will soon 
be all you have to drink.

338
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,720
It's good advice. I urinate into the CamelBak.  

339
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:53,600
The urine is now a dark orange colour. The 
other urine was clearer. Why didn't I save it?
 
 

340
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,840
57 hrs 15 mins

341
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,680
6.00 pm It's early evening. Sunlight shines 
off the bottom of thin clouds high above me.  

342
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,160
I hope they will stay and keep the 
heat in the canyon. But as time passes,  

343
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:20,720
it seems to grow colder. My water won't last much 
longer. Soon, I will have to start drinking urine.

344
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,920
Like the raven, the mosquitoes seem 
to arrive on time. I kill a few more.  

345
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,000
Mosquitoes mean there must be water quite 
close - probably at the Big Drop Rappel.

346
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,840
Forget it, Aron. You'll never see water again.

347
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,320
The first voice is back. I try not to listen.

348
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,560
CHAPTER SEVEN

349
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,560
'Where's Aron?'

350
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,960
Back in Aspen, Aron's housemates were preparing 
for the party. Elliot, another friend of his,  

351
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:04,480
was moving into the house after Leona had gone. 
At eight-thirty, he asked, 'Has anyone seen Aron?'

352
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,160
'No,' said Brian. 'He's 
probably still on his trip.'

353
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,800
'Does he know about the party?' Elliot asked.

354
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,240
'Of course,' said Leona. 'He 
said he'd be here for sure.

355
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,000
He'd better come. It's my goodbye party. 
I'll be upset if he doesn't come.'

356
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:36,240
The party ended at around two o'clock the next 
morning, but there was still no sign of Aron.

357
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,240
The first person to think something 
might be wrong was Aron's boss,  

358
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,680
Brion. Early Tuesday morning, he 
called the house and spoke to Leona.

359
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,640
'He didn't come to the party 
last night,' Leona told him.  

360
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,680
'I thought he'd driven straight to work.'

361
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,160
'No, he's not here, and Aron's never late.  

362
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,240
I think something might be wrong. Could 
you call me right away if he gets back?'

363
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,880
'Yes, sure,' said Leona, feeling a little worried.

364
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,640
She called Brion later that 
afternoon to ask if Aron had arrived.

365
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,840
'No,' said Brion. 'Did he say where he was going?'

366
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,880
'He didn't say much to any of us. Only 
that he was going climbing and biking.  

367
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:36,240
He also said he might hike in Utah. Somewhere 
in Canyonlands. He didn't say where, exactly.'

368
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:43,920
'Mmm, that's a big area,' said Brion. 'I'll 
wait until nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  

369
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,080
If he's not back by then, I'll call his parents.'

370
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:56,320
Aron's housemates decided not to wait any longer. 
At six-thirty that evening, they called the  

371
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:04,000
police. The officer on the desk asked for Aron's 
information: full name, age, height and weight.  

372
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,200
He also wanted to know the model of 
his truck and the license-plate number.  

373
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,880
But there was something the officer didn't 
tell them: a person has to be missing for  

374
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,280
at least forty-eight hours before the 
police will start a search and rescue  

375
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,640
operation. This meant that they wouldn't 
do anything until late the following day.
 
 

376
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,640
63 Mrs 15 mins

377
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,600
12.00 am It's my third night here and I've 
decided to take my first sip of urine.  

378
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,400
There's still half a cup of water 
left, but I want to save it.

379
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,600
The urine tastes bad, but not 
quite as bad as I thought.  

380
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:54,000
I decide not to drink any more until the water is 
finished. I've changed my drinking routine because  

381
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,040
the night is colder. I can now only sit for a 
few minutes so I take smaller sips every hour.
 
 

382
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,640
66 hrs 15 mins

383
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,840
3.00 am It's now sixty hours since my accident.  

384
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,960
That's sixty hours of pain, no 
sleep, and very little water.

385
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:23,120
Two hours later, it's time for my next sip of 
water. I put the bottle between my legs and  

386
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:31,520
turn the top. When it's open, I try and lift it 
towards my mouth. But it hits my harness and falls  

387
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:39,760
back onto my legs. I am too tired to catch it. 
Some of the valuable water falls onto my shorts.

388
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,240
'Damn! Damn! Damn!' I shout.

389
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,080
Now look what you've done! Says the first voice.

390
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:57,760
I know exactly what I've done. I've 
just lost half of the rest of my life.
 
 

391
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,000
70 hrs

392
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:10,320
6.45 am As morning arrives once more, I feel a 
little hope. At least I've survived another night.  

393
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,800
It's now Tuesday, April the 29th: 
my fourth day trapped in the canyon.

394
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,600
I decide to film earlier today. I 
put the camcorder on the boulder,  

395
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,120
then turn the screen the other way. I 
don't want to look at myself as I speak.

396
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,520
'Hi. It's Tuesday morning. I guess 
everyone missed me when I didn't arrive  

397
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,440
for Leona's party last night. Most people 
will probably think I'm still travelling.  

398
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,080
Except for Brion. When I don't arrive 
for work, he'll think something is wrong.  

399
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:57,600
He might call the police and report me missing. 
They'll wait forty-eight hours before searching.  

400
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,560
If I'm lucky, they'll start some time 
on Wednesday. If I'm very lucky, they  

401
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,440
might search the Robbers Roost area first. Even 
then, the earliest they'll reach me is Thursday.  

402
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,640
I'll try to stay alive as long as I can, but I 
can't imagine living longer than one more day.  

403
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:27,920
This means help will arrive too late. By Thursday, 
I'll be dead. And this video will be history.'
 
 
 

404
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,480
CHAPTER EIGHT

405
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,240
The raven

406
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,440
70 hrs 45 mins

407
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:44,640
7.30 am That last video recording was the 
most pessimistic so far. It's strange,  

408
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:51,360
but the feeling of hopelessness doesn't last. 
As the sky grows brighter, I think of the raven.  

409
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,840
The bird is a sign of hope. Just thinking 
about it makes me want to do something.

410
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:06,240
I try lifting the boulder once more. I make 
the rope even shorter, but when I step on it,  

411
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:13,760
nothing happens. I do everything I can to 
make it work. I push, jump and shout as I  

412
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,880
put all my weight onto the rope. It's still no 
good. The boulder doesn't move a millimetre.

413
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:30,400
I step down and lay my head on the boulder. I feel 
like crying but I can't. There's not enough water  

414
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:40,000
in my body to produce any tears. But there's still 
the knife. It's lying open on top of the boulder.

415
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,320
Suddenly, I know what I'm going to do.  

416
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,840
Quickly, I put the tourniquet around my arm 
and tighten it. Then I pick up the multi-tool,  

417
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:57,520
open the shorter knife and push it hard into my 
arm. This time, the knife goes all the way in.

418
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,040
I pull out the knife and look at the 
deep hole I've made in my right arm.  

419
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:11,680
I can't believe I've done this. It didn't even 
hurt and there's very little blood. I can see the  

420
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:18,320
bones in my arm through the hole. I will never be 
able to cut through them with only a small knife.

421
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,240
It's time for a drink. I pick up the bottle and 
feel the last of the water disappear down my  

422
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:34,480
throat. I check the time. It's exactly 8.00 
am and all I have to drink now is urine.
 
 

423
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,080
71 hrs 45 mins

424
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:45,520
8.30 am The raven appears. It's 
fifteen minutes late but I'm happy.  

425
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,640
I was beginning to think it wouldn't come. I feel 
happy and start thinking of all the wonderful  

426
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:59,920
times I've spent with friends and family. I 
remember a trip to Washington D.C. with my sister,  

427
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,600
and another to Gettysburg with my dad. 
I also think of all the adventures I've  

428
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:12,240
had with different friends. The time passes 
quickly Midday arrives without me realising.

429
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:20,240
I urinate into the CamelBak. Then I pour the 
clearer half of the urine into my water bottle.  

430
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:28,160
I throw the rest away. I have no idea how 
long anyone can survive on urine alone.  

431
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,320
At least drinking it wasn't as bad as I expected.

432
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,280
It is now the warmest part of the day. 
This is the time I am most comfortable.  

433
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,320
I have found the best way to sit 
and feel calmer in the warm air.  

434
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:51,680
Perhaps help will arrive in time. If 
so, I will soon be as free as the raven.

435
00:45:53,120 --> 00:46:00,000
Three hours later, I have reached the end of my 
third day trapped in the canyon. None of my plans  

436
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,480
of escape have worked. All I can do is stay 
strong for another night and hope for rescue.

437
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:16,400
I eat the last burrito. It is too dry to get down 
my throat so I take a mouthful of urine. The urine  

438
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,840
tastes better at night because it's colder, 
but it's still going to be a long, hard night.  

439
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,320
On Wednesday morning, Brion After was 
at work in the shop. At nine-fifteen,  

440
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:35,120
he called Leona to check if he had arrived, 
but he hadn't. Brion had waited long enough.

441
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:42,240
He picked up the phone. Aron's 
mother answered on the first ring.

442
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,120
'Mrs Ralston?'

443
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:44,720
'Yes?'

444
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,520
'This is Brion After - Aron's 
boss at Ute Mountaineer.  

445
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,800
I'm afraid I'm rather worried about him. He 
hasn't returned from a trip he took last week.  

446
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,520
Do you know where he went? No one here 
has seen him since last Wednesday.'

447
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,840
'Oh dear,' said Aron's mother. 
'I have no idea where he is.

448
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,960
I called him last week and left a 
message, but he didn't call back.  

449
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,040
Did he tell any of his 
housemates where he was going?'

450
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,480
'No, just that he might hike somewhere in the 
Canyonlands area of Utah,' explained Brion

451
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,760
'I think you should call the Aspen police.'

452
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,600
'Yes, I'll do that right now. 
I'll let you know what happens.'

453
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,400
'Thank you, Brion.'

454
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:47,600
Mrs Ralston's hand was shaking as she put down 
the phone. She suddenly had an idea. Perhaps  

455
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,840
Aron had sent an email to one of his 
friends saying where he was going?

456
00:47:53,280 --> 00:48:00,960
She went to the computer. Aron had an email 
address - but what was it? She found his name,  

457
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:07,760
but had to answer a secret question to read 
his emails. None of the answers she gave worked  

458
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:14,720
but she kept trying. In the end, she guessed the 
correct answer and sent the information to Brion.

459
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:22,640
After Brion had called the Aspen police, the 
head officer, Adam Crider, started the rescue  

460
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,320
operation. He called Mrs Ralston for the 
license-plate number of her son's truck.  

461
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,840
Mrs Ralston had written it down on a piece 
of paper. When she read it to Officer Crider,  

462
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:42,000
she didn't realise it was wrong. Aron had 
given it to her in a hurry and made a mistake.

463
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:49,280
Officer Crider called back and told Mrs Ralston 
there was no record of that license plate.  

464
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:56,000
This left her with another problem. How could 
she find the correct license-plate number?

465
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,760
Brion After was having better luck. He had 
found a list of email addresses for Aron's  

466
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,800
climbing friends. Perhaps they knew where 
he was. He wanted to check immediately,  

467
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,320
but he had to leave for Australia that 
day. He called Aron's housemate Elliot  

468
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:23,200
and asked him to manage the store and rescue 
operation until he returned. Elliot agreed.

469
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:30,960
When Elliot reached the store, he received 
a call from Mrs Ralston. She wanted to check  

470
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,920
the license-plate number she had 
given Brion. It was on his desk.  

471
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,120
Elliot checked as she read out the number.

472
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,360
'Wait. Did you say 886, Mrs Ralston?'

473
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:46,880
'Yes.'

474
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,120
'Brion made a mistake. He wrote down 888.  

475
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,840
I'll call Officer Crider and 
give him the correct number.'

476
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,840
By early afternoon, Elliot had 
received an email from Steve Pratchett,  

477
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:09,680
the most important of Aron's climbing 
friends. Steve had climbed for many years.  

478
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:18,800
He often led rescue operations to find climbers 
lost in the mountains. Another friend, Jason,  

479
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,920
had sent Steve a list of all the canyons 
Aron said he wanted to hike in Canyonlands.  

480
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,160
Steve called the Utah police for the 
area and spoke to one the main officers,  

481
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:37,280
Kyle Ekker. Officer Ekker was very helpful. 
Steve gave him the latest license-plate  

482
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,680
number for Aron's truck and Officer 
Ekker sent his men out to look for it.

483
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:50,960
They returned as night fell. There was no sign of 
the truck. Officer Ekker checked the number with  

484
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:58,880
the national license office. There was no vehicle 
on record. Once again, the number was wrong.

485
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,480
The bad news reached Aron's mother.  

486
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,120
Then she remembered that Aron was living in 
Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he bought the truck.  

487
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:16,800
The vehicle license office for the area was in 
Santa Fe. She called and an officer searched  

488
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:26,080
the records and found Aron's name. The records 
showed his license-plate number as NM 846-MMY.

489
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:33,520
Finally, they had the correct number. The 
information was given to Officer Ekker.  

490
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,480
It was too late to continue searching that 
night. It would have to wait until the morning.

491
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,000
'Wait for us, Aron,' Mrs Ralston said 
as she went to bed. 'We're coming.'
 
 

492
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,120
89 hrs 15 mins

493
00:51:52,640 --> 00:52:00,480
2.00 am The darkness seems unreal. In fact, I 
don't know what is real and what isn't anymore.  

494
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:07,840
I start to have visions. Friends suddenly 
appear in the canyon like silent ghosts  

495
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:14,320
and wave me towards them. I follow and find 
myself in some place I know from the past.  

496
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:22,640
They smile at me in a kind way, but they never 
speak. Because of their kindness, I am not afraid.  

497
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:30,240
I know they are protecting me. I am 
happy while the visions last. To me,  

498
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:37,200
they are real. It is only when they disappear and 
the cold and pain return that I know they are not.  

499
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:46,000
Then, shaking hard, I continue chipping at the 
boulder. After that, I sit again and it's not long  

500
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:53,280
before the visions return. During the second half 
of the night, I have visions of myself as a child.  

501
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,240
Sometimes I'm playing cards with my grandfather.  

502
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,440
Other times I am running across 
bright green fields with my friends.

503
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,920
Something about the visions tells me that I 
have not given the people I care about enough  

504
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:16,400
attention. I'm always thinking of the things I 
want to achieve and not noticing other people.  

505
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,800
Now I realise that my love for friends and 
family is the main reason I want to escape.  

506
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:29,280
The thought of seeing them again is 
keeping me alive. I promise myself that  

507
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,760
if I can escape from here back to the 
people, I will be kinder towards them.

508
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:42,080
The visions always include some kind of drink. 
It is usually something cold and sweet like apple  

509
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:50,800
juice or ice tea. Just as I am about to drink, the 
vision disappears and I wake up. Then I feel the  

510
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:58,080
cold and the pain of the rope against my legs. 
I stand up and begin my routine all over again.

511
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,600
However, the visions tell me 
something: I am not ready to die.  

512
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,840
As morning comes on the fifth day, I feel 
sure I can still last a few more days.  

513
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:18,240
I don't know if this is true, but I'm still 
alive when the sun rises. The raven appears on  

514
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:26,080
time. The sound of its wings and the light in the 
canyon are beautiful. I watch its smooth flight,  

515
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:32,320
following the line of the canyon. I take out my 
camera and film as it disappears from view.
 
 
 

516
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,560
CHAPTER NINE

517
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,480
'It's his truck'

518
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,920
97 hrs 45 mins

519
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:49,200
10.30 am I don't want to look at my watch. When 
I did this last night, the time seemed to pass  

520
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:58,800
more slowly. I have a new idea. It came to me, as 
I was looking at all the rocks around me. Why not  

521
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:06,240
find a hard rock and use it to break the boulder? 
There's one in a hole in the canyon wall above me.  

522
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:14,000
It is round and black. I reach up and pull it out. 
It's perfect - just the right size and weight.

523
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:21,360
I hit the rock hard against the boulder. 
Little bits of stone fly into the air.  

524
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,720
It's working. I continue, but soon have to 
stop because of the pain in my left hand.  

525
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,760
I decide to rest for a while.

526
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:40,240
Early afternoon is usually the warmest time 
of day. But today it's only thirteen degrees,  

527
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:46,000
the coldest day so far. It also means 
that tonight will be the coldest night.  

528
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,960
Realising this makes me want to do 
something while it's still light.

529
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,920
The problem with using the black rock 
was that it hurt my left hand. But what  

530
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:05,520
if I tie a sock around my hand to protect 
it? I do this and it works. By 6.00 pm,  

531
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:12,320
I have taken off more of the boulder in three 
hours than I did in four days. But it's still  

532
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:18,320
not enough. And even with the sock there is 
too much pain in my left hand to continue.

533
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:25,520
I put down the rock. I feel sure I won't 
survive another night in the canyon.  

534
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,920
I finally accept this. There is 
nothing else I can do to save myself.
 
 

535
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,760
110 hrs 15 mins

536
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:44,800
11.00 pm The canyon feels as cold as ice. 
I have been awake for over a hundred hours.  

537
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,400
Another night of the sitting - standing routine 
will kill me. I haven't had any clean water since  

538
00:56:52,400 --> 00:57:00,240
eight o'clock yesterday morning, only urine. How 
much longer can I survive? Death could come at  

539
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:06,880
any moment. I am so certain of this that I take 
the knife and write the dates of my life on the  

540
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:14,960
canyon wall. When I have finished I read them by 
the light of my headlamp: ARON OCT 75 - APR 03.

541
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:22,800
Around midnight, I have another vision. I 
am walking alone through the canyon wall.  

542
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,040
On the other side is a living room. 
I step inside and look around.  

543
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:36,000
A little boy in a red shirt comes into 
the room. I guess he must be about three.  

544
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:43,680
Suddenly, I know who he is. He is my future 
son and the room is in my future home.  

545
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:51,040
The little boy runs across the wooden floor, 
laughing. I pick him up with my left arm.  

546
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:58,480
My right arm has no hand. Then I put him 
onto my shoulder and he laughs even more.  

547
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,000
He holds my arms in his little hands 
and together we dance around the room.  

548
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,960
The sun is shining and I 
feel free, happy, and alive.

549
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:17,360
The vision disappears. I am back in the canyon 
again, but now I don't feel the same as before.  

550
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,480
Seeing the boy has changed everything. Now,  

551
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,520
even with the cold, pain, tiredness 
and thirst, I am sure I will survive.

552
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:34,480
On Thursday, May the 1st, Kyle Ekker 
was looking at a map of the Canyonlands  

553
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:42,400
area on his office wall. The clock above 
read 9.07 am. Already that morning,  

554
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,560
his men had searched the top and 
centre of the area and found nothing.

555
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,440
What about the Robbers Roost canyons 
in the south? The only roads down there  

556
00:58:53,440 --> 00:59:00,720
were made of rocks and sand. It might take 
longer to search. He called Glen Sherrill,  

557
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:07,200
the head officer for the area. When Glen 
answered the phone, Kyle described Aron's truck.

558
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:14,800
'It's a red Toyota. License number NM 846-MMY.'

559
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,200
'I think I've seen a truck 
like that,' Glen replied.  

560
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,360
'I'll radio one of my men and ask them to check.'

561
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,720
Kyle thanked him and put down the phone.

562
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:32,640
Twenty minutes later, Glen 
called back. 'Officer Kyle?'

563
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,400
'Speaking.'

564
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,920
'Glen Sherrill here. We've found 
the truck you're looking for.  

565
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,120
It's in the Horseshoe Canyon carpark.'

566
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:51,760
By 10.00 am, the good news had reached 
Elliot, Steve, and Mrs Ralston. Steve  

567
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,640
immediately arranged for a rescue team to 
join the police and help in the search.  

568
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:03,120
Half an hour later, they were on their 
way. Things were now moving fast.
 
 
 

569
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,680
CHAPTER TEN

570
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,360
Escape

571
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,320
120 hrs

572
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:20,640
8.45 am It's Thursday, May the 1st. 120 
hours without sleep. Two days without  

573
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:27,840
water. I can't believe I'm still alive. I 
didn't think I'd survive beyond Wednesday.  

574
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,560
Perhaps the vision of the little 
boy kept me alive last night.  

575
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:38,400
But now, with no sign of a rescue, 
my hopes are disappearing fast.

576
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,040
I am also upset because the raven hasn't appeared.  

577
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:50,480
It's never been this late before. I try and 
forget about the bird and pick up the camcorder.  

578
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:56,320
I am certain that this will be 
my last message to my family.

579
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:00,240
I am calm as I leave necessary 
instructions for my parents.

580
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,480
I tell them to give most of my things to Sonja.  

581
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:12,960
Then I tell them what to do with my dead body. The 
video ends with three simple words: 'I love you.'

582
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,760
I'm crying as I close the 
camcorder for the last time.  

583
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,240
But there are no tears - my 
body is too dry for tears.

584
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:31,120
Now I can only wait. I can't accept this. I've 
discovered that nothing I can do will help me  

585
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:38,240
escape. But it's better to be doing something than 
nothing. I pick up the black rock and hit it as  

586
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:44,640
hard as I can against the boulder. I continue, 
trying to forget the pain in my left hand.  

587
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:52,160
In the end, I can't. I try to drop the 
rock, but the fingers of my hand won't open.

588
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,280
What have you done now? asks the first voice.

589
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,320
Stay calm, says the second.

590
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,840
Slowly, my fingers loosen and 
the stone falls out of my hand.  

591
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,560
I look at my other arm. It's 
covered with bits of rock.

592
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:16,800
As I'm removing these with the knife 
I push too hard and the blade goes  

593
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:24,000
through the skin near my wrist. I don't feel 
anything. That part of my arm must be dead.  

594
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:32,000
My right hand died long ago. It's now 
a dark blue colour. I push the knife  

595
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,480
through the skin of my thumb. There's a sound 
as some gas escapes, followed by a bad smell.

596
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:46,400
The arm is poisoned and the poison will kill me. 
I don't want the arm to be a part of me anymore.  

597
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:54,160
I throw myself against the boulder. When I look 
at my arm, I see that it's in a strange position.

598
01:02:55,600 --> 01:03:02,720
That moment is like the sun coming out. 
I realise what it means. I can break my  

599
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:08,480
arm by using my own weight. That means I 
won't have to cut through bone anymore.  

600
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:16,880
I throw the whole weight of my body below the 
boulder. There is a loud noise. I keep going.  

601
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,720
There is a second loud noise. I've done 
it! I've broken both bones in my arm.

602
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,840
I tie the tourniquet, take 
the knife and begin cutting.

603
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,560
The only thing on my mind is 
escape, but the pain is terrible.

604
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,000
I scream as I push down with the knife.

605
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,840
For almost one hour the pain, 
screams, and cutting continue.
 
 

606
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,080
122 hrs 47 mins

607
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:55,520
11.32 am Finally, I feel the knife 
hit rock on the other side of my arm.  

608
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,680
I fall back with a single thought 
screaming through my head.

609
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:06,800
You've done it, Aron! You're FREE! FREE! FREE!

610
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:13,440
There's no time to lose. Blood is 
coming out of the end of my arm  

611
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,520
and it's a long walk back to my truck.

612
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,640
I tighten the tourniquet. Then I tie 
my climbing bag on my arm to hold it.  

613
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:29,600
I tighten it around my neck and put 
my things inside. Before I leave,  

614
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:36,160
I take two pictures of the part of my arm still 
trapped by the boulder. Now I am ready to go.

615
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:46,800
I can't walk straight. My body crashes from one 
side of the canyon wall to the other. I stop. My  

616
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:56,640
heart is going much too fast. I could still die at 
any moment. I make myself stay calm. What I need  

617
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:03,280
most of all is water. There might be some at the 
Big Drop Rappel, but first I need to get there.

618
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,440
It takes me twenty minutes. I 
stand at the edge and look down.  

619
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,680
It is just over eighteen 
metres to the canyon floor.

620
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:22,320
There are metal rings in the rock for climbers. 
I tie my rope to them and rappel down.  

621
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:29,360
With only one arm, this is not easy. For 
once, I am careful as I go down the rope.  

622
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:37,840
I reach the bottom and turn. On the ground in 
front of me is a pool of brown water. It's full  

623
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:44,800
of dead mosquitoes but I don't care. I fill my 
bottle and drink one litre in a few seconds.  

624
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:52,320
I drink another and don't want to move. I just 
want to stay there for the rest of my life.

625
01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:00,240
That won't be long if you don't start walking. 
There are still twelve kilometres to go.

626
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:09,600
The voice is right. I drink one more litre, 
slowly this time. Then I fill my bottle and  

627
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:15,280
the CamelBak and begin walking. Blood 
is coming out faster from my arm now.  

628
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,120
I wonder if I can get back to the truck in time.

629
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:28,880
Things start to go wrong. I get lost up a side 
canyon and have to turn round. Then I notice that  

630
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:36,720
water is coming out of my CamelBak. There's a hole 
in it. Quickly, I drink the rest of the water.  

631
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:44,240
Now I only have the water in the water bottle. 
This has to last all the way back to the truck  

632
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:50,800
and the temperature is rising. I am so weak 
and tired I can't imagine surviving that long.  

633
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:57,360
I take a sip and keep the water in my 
mouth as I walk. That seems to help.

634
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,840
I still wonder if I can get back to my truck.  

635
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:09,440
I can't walk straight, I can't think for more 
than a few seconds, and I'm losing blood, fast.
 
 

636
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,840
125 hrs 10 mins

637
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,880
1.55 pm I've arrived at the Great Gallery.  

638
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,520
The paintings are amazing but all I can 
think of is water. There is more here.

639
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,960
I stop to fill the water bottle. It has 
taken me two and a half hours to travel  

640
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:41,280
six kilometres. For someone close to death I have 
done well. But my problems are getting worse every  

641
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:48,240
minute. Blood is now coming from my arm really 
fast and I'm in terrible pain from the amputation.  

642
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,840
I want to stop and rest, 
but I can't. I must go on.

643
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:01,840
I walk as fast as I can. By two-thirty, 
I have covered nearly ten kilometres.  

644
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,680
Only three more kilometres to my truck, 
but I'm feeling weaker every minute.
 
 

645
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,160
125 hrs 45 mins

646
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:20,800
2.30 pm I've come to another huge canyon. 
The walls must be over thirty metres high.  

647
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:29,600
Ahead of me is a steep hill. This is bad news. 
I'll never be able to climb it - I'm too weak.  

648
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:38,080
Something makes me look again. I shake 
my head, unable to believe what I see.

649
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,400
About seventy metres ahead of me are 
a family of three people - a man,  

650
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,720
a woman and a young boy. They 
are walking away from me.

651
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:52,800
'HELP! HELP! PLEASE! I NEED HELP!'

652
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,400
They turn and come running towards me.

653
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:05,200
When they reach me, I begin telling my story: 
'My name is Aron Ralston. I was trapped by a  

654
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:12,160
boulder in the canyon for five days. This 
morning, I had to amputate my arm to escape.  

655
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:21,120
I need a doctor. I'm losing blood, fast...' 
Unable to continue, I fall to the ground.

656
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:28,720
The man gives me a bottle of water. 'The police 
at the carpark told us about you,' he says.

657
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:37,920
His name is Eric. His wife is Monique and his 
son is called Andy. They are tourists from the  

658
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:44,080
Netherlands. Eric gives me more water while 
Monique and Andy run back to get the police.  

659
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:50,160
After about ten minutes, Eric helps 
me up and we continue walking slowly.

660
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:58,000
The steep trail is ahead. Even with Eric's 
help, I know I won't be able to climb it.  

661
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,040
'How will I ever get out 
of here?' I ask myself.
 
 
 

662
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,040
CHAPTER ELEVEN

663
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,400
127 hours

664
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,640
126 hrs 18 mins

665
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:20,800
3.03 pm A noise somewhere above me 
answers the question. It's a helicopter!  

666
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:28,400
A helicopter to take me to hospital. I 
can't believe it! It doesn't seem real.  

667
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:34,080
I sit down and wait as a man jumps 
to the ground and walks towards me.

668
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,840
'Are you Aron Ralston?' he asks.

669
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:39,280
'Yes.'

670
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,000
A second man gets out of the 
helicopter and they help me  

671
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:50,720
inside. I ask one of the men to get 
my climbing bag. Eric gives it to him.

672
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:56,320
'Thank you, Eric,' I say. 'Thanks for everything.'  

673
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,880
I wave goodbye as the 
helicopter rises into the air.

674
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,240
I sit behind the pilot and watch 
blood pour slowly down my arm.

675
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,320
Be strong, Aron. You're almost safe.

676
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,360
'Keep him talking,' the pilot says to his partner.

677
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,000
'Where are we going?' I ask the second man.

678
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:25,920
'We're taking you to the 
hospital in Moab,' he replies.

679
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,200
'How long will that take?'

680
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,240
'It's about twelve minutes from here.'

681
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,920
He asks me what happened in the 
canyon and I begin telling my story.  

682
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:44,800
By the time I finish, we are circling around Moab. 
I look down and see an area of green grass below.

683
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:54,000
This gets bigger as we move down towards it. I 
realise we are landing in front of the hospital.  

684
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,400
A man who looks like a policeman is 
standing with two nurses in white  

685
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:04,640
coats on the hospital steps. The helicopter 
lands and the nurses carry me into the building.

686
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,440
They put me in an empty room. The 
man walks in and introduces himself.  

687
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,120
'Hi, Aron. I'm Steve, and I'm a Park Ranger.'

688
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:24,080
As the nurses take off my shoes, I ask 
Steve to let my mother know that I'm OK  

689
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,120
and to arrange for someone to collect all 
the things I left at Horseshoe Canyon.

690
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,680
'I'll do that when we've 
finished here,' Steve replies.

691
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:43,360
He wants to know what happened in the canyon. Once 
again, I tell my story. It's the third time I've  

692
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:50,640
done this in two hours. When I finish, I can see 
that Steve wants to ask me a lot of questions.

693
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:57,920
He doesn't get the chance. A doctor comes 
back into the room with a large needle.

694
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:04,320
'Wait!' I say as she goes to put it into my skin.  

695
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:11,760
'I have a problem with needles. I sometimes 
go into shock. I fell out of a chair once.'

696
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:17,840
The doctor looks surprised. 'You 
mean you're not in shock already?'

697
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,400
'I don't know,' I reply.

698
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,840
'Look, do you want this for the pain or not?'

699
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:32,800
'Damn it, yes!' I say. I continue talking 
to Steve as the needle goes into my arm.
 
 

700
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,160
127 hrs

701
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,840
3.45 pm I suddenly hear another man's voice.  

702
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:49,840
He sounds like a doctor. He pulls at the things 
over my right arm and asks Steve what they are.

703
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,800
'There are a couple of tourniquets 
under there,' Steve replies.

704
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:00,720
'No, just one,' I whisper. I 
look at the clock on the wall.

705
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:09,200
It's 3.45 pm on Thursday, May the 
1st. I realise that my nightmare  

706
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:17,840
has lasted for exactly 127 hours. It's my last 
thought before falling into a long, deep sleep.
 
 

707
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:19,520
EPILOGUE

708
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:27,680
My rescue was only the first part of a long, 
difficult fight back to health. In that first  

709
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:34,240
month, I had five operations. I was also 
taking eighteen different medicines a day.  

710
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:42,400
Most were for the pain and to fight the poison in 
my blood. While I was taking them, I couldn't do  

711
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:50,560
anything well. I couldn't sleep and my thoughts 
were unclear. After ten days in hospital, I went  

712
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:57,600
home. A week later, I was back in hospital in 
Denver for my fifth and most difficult operation.  

713
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:05,840
The time I woke up after the operation was the 
lowest point after my escape. I felt terrible.  

714
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,800
I couldn't eat, I couldn't 
sleep and I was still in pain.  

715
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:19,040
Later, I discovered that I nearly died. 
However by May the 25th, I was home to stay.

716
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:26,400
The following weeks were difficult for 
my family. I was like a child again,  

717
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:34,000
unable to do anything for myself. Slowly, 
however, things got better. I was soon eating  

718
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,360
normal food and by the end of the summer, I 
was the same weight as before the accident.

719
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:50,000
By this time, I had a prosthetic arm. I learnt 
to use it quite well. I felt pleased. It wouldn't  

720
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:56,720
be long before I would be able to go climbing 
again. Of course, I didn't tell my mother that.

721
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:05,040
On August the 31st, four months after the 
accident, I spoke at Sonja's wedding. Four  

722
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:09,920
days later, I climbed Mount Moran 
in Wyoming with eight of my friends.

723
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:16,720
On October the 25th - two days before 
my twenty-eighth birthday - I returned  

724
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:22,080
to Blue John Canyon. Some friends, 
including Kristi Moore, were with me.  

725
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,600
We filmed the place where the accident happened.  

726
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:32,400
Then, as the others made their way back to their 
vehicles, I stayed behind for a few minutes.  

727
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:38,160
Just before I left, I looked at the 
dates of my life on the canyon wall.  

728
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:48,080
I was wrong. My life didn't end in the canyon. 
Thoughts of the people I love had kept me alive.  

729
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:56,640
If I wanted to see them again, I had to survive. 
That's what I told myself. And that's what I did.

730
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:04,640
My accident changed my life. I know that 
even if I could travel back in time,  

731
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:11,200
I wouldn't change anything. I would still say 
goodbye to Megan and Kristi and continue alone.  

732
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:18,160
I've learned a lot from that choice. I believe 
we are on Earth to do the things we love,  

733
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:24,800
even if that means making a hard choice. 
Sometimes, that means cutting out something  

734
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:31,640
and leaving it in the past. Saying goodbye to 
things from our past is also a new beginning.
 
 
 
 

735
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,172
- THE END -
