00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,240
Beyond the Wall

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,160
I was born in the United States, but 
I lived in Hong Kong for many years.  

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,280
My business in Asia was successful and I became 
rich. After twenty years, I decided to visit  

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,960
my home in New York. On my way from Hong Kong 
to New York, I stayed one week in California.

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,160
I had a friend who lived in the city of San 
Francisco and I wanted to see him again.  

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,200
His name was Mohun Dampier and he 
had been my friend for many years.  

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:49,200
We had written many letters to each other. But 
recently, I had not received any news from him.

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,960
Dampier had never had a job. His father gave 
him a little money, so Dampier had never worked.

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,600
Dampier was a superstitious man. He 
believed that luck or magic could  

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,840
make things happen in his life. He spent 
most of his time reading books-strange  

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:26,240
books. Most of the books were about occult 
philosophy. I called them books about magic.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,520
As soon as I arrived in San Francisco, 
I sent a message to Dampier's house.  

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,840
The message said: I am staying in San 
Francisco for three days. May I visit you?

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,680
Dampier surprised me. An hour later, he 
sent a servant to my hotel with a reply.

15
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,440
Come to my house at once, my dear 
friend, he wrote. Come this evening.  

16
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:04,960
You'll remember the house-'I'm sure. It was my 
fathers' home. I live in a tower at one end of the  

17
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,800
house. You don't have to ring the bell or knock 
on the door. Il tell the servants to go to bed.  

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,640
And I'll leave the front door of the tower open.  

19
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,640
Come up the stairs immediately. I'll 
he waiting for you. Please come soon.

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,320
I rode in a cab to Dampier's house. 
That evening, the weather was stormy.  

21
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:43,040
A strong wind was blowing and cold rain was 
falling. I had forgotten that California is  

22
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,320
cold and wet in winter. I only remembered 
the sunshine, not the wind and the rain.

23
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,960
Dampier's house was near the Pacific Ocean.  

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,840
It was an ugly, two-story building that was 
made of bricks. There was a tower at one end.  

25
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,640
The house was surrounded by a garden of many 
trees and beautiful plants. But now it was winter  

26
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,840
and there were no leaves on the 
trees or flowers on the plants.

27
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:27,040
The driver stopped his cab near the tower. 
Although the front door was only five yards away,  

28
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,840
I became soaked with rain as 
soon as I stepped out of the cab.  

29
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,280
I ran to the door of the 
tower and turned the handle.

30
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,080
The door was unlocked and I opened it. 
One small lamp burned on the stairway  

31
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:54,640
and it did not give much light. The hall was 
full of shadows and I could not see clearly.  

32
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:04,080
I climbed the stairs slowly, touching the wall 
with my fingers. At the top of the stairs there  

33
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,640
was another door. I opened it and went into 
a room that was lit with another small lamp.

34
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,680
Dampier came forward, held my hand 
and shook it. He was wearing a long  

35
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,840
silk coat and soft leather slippers on his feet. 
His clothes were old-fashioned and strange.

36
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:38,400
We looked at each other and I was shocked. I 
had not seen Dampier for many years. My friend  

37
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:47,760
had changed a lot! He had been a handsome man but 
now his hair was gray and his face was very pale.  

38
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,720
There were many lines around his eyes and 
mouth. Dampier looked like a thin old man,  

39
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:05,360
but he was not older than fifty. His large and 
bright eyes shone strangely in the shadowy room.

40
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,400
"Welcome, my friend! Please sit down," he said.

41
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,440
Dampier offered me some wine and a cigar 
and we talked a little. But I am afraid  

42
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,960
that our conversation was not very interesting. 
Meeting friends after many years can be difficult  

43
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,640
and it can make you sad. Maybe 
Dampier guessed my thoughts.

44
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,440
"Non sum qualis  

45
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,240
eram-I'm not as I was," he said.

46
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,080
I tried to make a joke. "Your 
Latin hasn't improved," I replied.

47
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:03,120
My friend smiled. "Latin is a dead 
language and I'm a dead man," he said.  

48
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:11,040
Then his smile disappeared and 
he said, "I'll die very soon."

49
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:22,960
I did not know what to say. I smoked my cigar and 
drank my wine. We were both silent for several  

50
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:30,720
minutes. Outside, the wind had stopped 
blowing. I wanted to leave the house.

51
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:42,880
Suddenly I heard a strange noise. TAP. TAP. 
TAP. It was the sound of someone, or something,  

52
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:51,760
knocking. Was the sound coming from 
one wall of the tower? TAP. TAP. TAP.  

53
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:01,840
The sound was not quick or loud. It was not 
the sound of someone knocking loudly on a door.  

54
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,920
The soft tapping sounded like 
someone sending a signal-a message.

55
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Dampier had forgotten me. He was staring at the 
wall. There was a strange expression on his face.  

56
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,440
My friend looked excited and 
afraid. His eyes shone brightly.

57
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,320
I did not know what to do. 
Should I go or stay? I stood up.

58
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:45,920
"I-I see that you are very tired," I said. 
"I'll leave. May I visit you tomorrow?"

59
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,640
Dampier turned his head and looked at me.

60
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:59,120
"Please stay," he said. "There's 
no problem. Nobody is there."

61
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,920
He walked to a small window and opened 
it. I had not noticed' the window earlier.

62
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
"Look," he said.

63
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,080
I walked across the room and 
looked out of the window.

64
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,800
I could see nothing except 
the light of a street lamp  

65
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:29,600
and rain falling. No one was standing outside. 
There was no one near the wall of the tower.

66
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,040
"Please don't leave me," said Dampier.  

67
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:44,480
"I must tell you a story. You're the only man that 
I can tell it to. Will you listen to my story?"

68
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,080
I wanted to go back to my hotel. 
Dampier, his house and the strange noise  

69
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:02,480
made me feel uncomfortable. I think that I 
am a sensible and intelligent man. But I felt  

70
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:10,640
unhappy and frightened in that old tower room. 
However, I did not want to upset my old friend.

71
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,280
"Very well," I said. "I'll stay and listen."

72
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:27,360
Dampier poured me another drink and offered me 
another cigar. Then he began to tell his story.

73
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:39,840
"I didn't move into this house until my father 
died," Dampier said. "That was ten years ago, when  

74
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:49,840
I was about forty years old. When my father died, 
I got his business, his property and his money.

75
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,760
"Before his death, I lived in a large apartment 
building on Rincon Hill," said Dampier.  

76
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:07,120
"Maybe you know that area of San Francisco? Rincon 
Hill was a fashionable area fifty years ago,  

77
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:16,080
but now it is run-down and neglected. The owner 
of the apartment building rented out many of its  

78
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:24,000
small rooms. The walls of the rooms were thin. 
You could almost put your hand through them.

79
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,520
"I was lucky," Dampier went on. "The rent was 
cheap and I had a large room in the building.  

80
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,440
No one visited me. And no one disturbed 
me-I could study my books quietly.  

81
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,840
I lived happily on Rincon Hill.

82
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,400
"One morning, as I was leaving the apartment, 
I saw a young girl," Dampier continued.  

83
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,720
"It was a warm day in June. She was 
wearing a white dress and a straw hat.  

84
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,880
There were brightly-colored flowers 
and ribbons around the brim of the hat.  

85
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,760
Then I saw the girls face. It's 
difficult to find words to describe it.  

86
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:28,080
Her face was strange and beautiful. I had 
never seen such a beautiful face before.  

87
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:36,240
Without thinking, I lifted my hat and bowed. 
She looked at me with shining brown eyes,  

88
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:45,040
but she didn't speak. I knew that she was 
pleased to see me, but she didn't smile.  

89
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,440
She went into the house and shut the door. 
I stood and stared at the closed door.  

90
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Would I see her again? Should I 
speak to her? Would she speak to me?

91
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,160
"Maybe you think that these are the thoughts 
of a much younger man," said Dampier.  

92
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:19,440
"And maybe you're right. But these feelings 
were new to me. I'd never been in love before.  

93
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,400
I'd spent too many years with books 
and too little time with people.  

94
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,600
Now I believe that you're my only friend.  

95
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,640
Soon, none of this will matter. I 
don't feel foolish when I talk to you."

96
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,840
Dampier stopped speaking for a few 
moments, then he went on with his story.

97
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,200
"The next day, I waited in my apartment. 
For many hours, I stared out of the window.  

98
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,720
I watched the street, but the girl 
didn't come out of the building.  

99
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,640
I didn't know her name, so I 
couldn't ask anyone about her.  

100
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,520
That night I couldn't sleep. The next 
morning, I sat by the window again and waited.

101
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,800
"Then suddenly, she came out of the 
apartment building and I went out too.  

102
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,040
But when I reached the street, she had 
disappeared. I didn't see where she had gone,  

103
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:42,720
so I walked around the neighborhood. At last I saw 
her in a narrow street. We smiled at each other.  

104
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,400
She recognized me, I'm sure of that. From that 
time, I often went out when the girl went out.  

105
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,200
She always wore the straw hat with the 
brightly-colored flowers and ribbons on its brim.  

106
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,040
I didn't follow her. I simply walked around 
the neighborhood, and hoped to see her again.

107
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,080
"At last, I went to the landlady of the apartment.  

108
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:21,280
'Who is the girl with the pretty face and the 
straw hat?' I asked her. 'She's my niece, sir,'  

109
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,360
the landlady replied. 'She's 
a servant in this house.  

110
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:34,320
She lives here because her parents are dead. She 
works for me-she cooks and cleans the building.  

111
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,640
I also send her to buy our food. 
She lives at the top of the house.  

112
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,960
Her room is next to yours, but at 
the top of the other staircase.'

113
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:57,280
"Oh, my friend! I wish that I'd never heard 
that piece of information," Dampier said to  

114
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:08,480
me. "The girl's room was next to mine. She was 
on the other side of the thin wall. At night,

115
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,800
I put my hand on the wall and I thought 
of her. Was her bed by the wall?  

116
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,280
Was she sleeping only a few inches from my hand?

117
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,440
"I couldn't study because of the girl," 
said Dampier. "My mind wasn't clear.  

118
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,080
I only thought about the girl. I 
couldn't study my books about the occult.

119
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:44,080
"I'd never wanted to marry," Dampier went 
on. "I'd never wanted a wife and children.  

120
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:52,320
I was only interested in learning. And I could 
never marry a poor, uneducated servant girl.  

121
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,000
My father would never have given his permission.  

122
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:07,840
All my money came from my father. If he 
had stopped giving me money... well..."

123
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,720
"What happened next?" I asked.

124
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
My friend looked at me sadly.

125
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:26,000
"I stopped waiting for her and I stopped watching 
her. I only studied. I spent all my time reading  

126
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,840
my books. But one hot night I couldn't sleep. 
Thoughts were racing around and around in my mind.  

127
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:44,880
I thought again and again about the beautiful 
girl. I wanted to be with her. She was only on  

128
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:56,800
the other side of the wall! I tapped on the wall. 
I tapped very gently three times. TAP. TAP. TAP.  

129
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,840
I tapped again. TAP. TAP. TAP.  

130
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,600
Then I felt foolish. I was behaving like 
a boy who is in love for the first time.  

131
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,640
I got out of my bed and began to study my books.

132
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:29,280
"I was reading a strange book," Dampier said. "It 
was a book of occult philosophy by Necromantius.  

133
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,680
You would call it a book 
of magic and superstition.  

134
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,680
In his book, Necromantius describes 
how to be a fortune-teller.  

135
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,520
Necromantius also wrote about strange and 
terrible things that happen three times.  

136
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:57,440
When these things happened three times, 
death would come. Necromantius called this  

137
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:05,040
a 'fatal triad'. I believe that a 
fatal triad has happened to me."

138
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,920
"Why?" I asked. "What happened?"

139
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:20,800
"While I was alone, reading that strange book by 
Necromantius," said Dampier, "I heard a sound.  

140
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,840
It was a soft tapping sound. 
It came from beyond the wall.  

141
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,360
It was the answer to my own signal! TAP. TAP. TAP.  

142
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:44,400
I knew that the pretty servant girl was sending 
a message to me. She wanted me to come to her.  

143
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:58,320
I ran to the wall and tapped my signal again. 
TAP. TAP. TAP. But after that, there was silence.  

144
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,840
She didn't reply to any of my other signals. I 
listened for many hours, but I heard nothing more.

145
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,720
"For many days after this, I looked for the 
girl," Dampier said. "But I never saw her again.  

146
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:28,000
I tried to forget her. Then one evening, I 
went to bed early because I was very tired.  

147
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,360
In the middle of the night, I awoke 
suddenly. I had heard a soft sound.  

148
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:44,080
I opened my eyes and sat up. I heard a 
soft tapping on the wall beside the bed.  

149
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:55,280
In a few moments, it was repeated. TAP. TAP. 
TAP. I was going to reply to the signal,  

150
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:05,840
then I stopped. The girl hadn't replied to my 
last messages. I would not reply to her now!"

151
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,040
Dampier drank a little wine and then continued.

152
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:21,920
"I lay in the bed listening," he said. "But 
I didn't reply. At last, I must have slept.  

153
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,600
When I awoke, it was late and I felt tired.  

154
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:36,720
I needed some fresh air, so I went out of my 
apartment. The landlady was outside my door.  

155
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,560
'Oh, Mr Dampier,' she said. 'Have 
you heard the terrible news?'

156
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:55,760
"My heart began to beat quickly. My voice shook 
when I answered. 'W-what news?' I asked her.  

157
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,920
'My poor niece was sick for a week,' 
the landlady replied. 'Didn't you know?  

158
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,600
I've seen you watching her. 
Didn't you know that she was ill?'

159
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:21,520
"I was shocked," said Dampier. "I didn't know 
what to say. Yes. I had looked at the girl,  

160
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:30,800
but I'd never spoken to her. My mind was always 
full of thoughts of my books and thoughts of her.  

161
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:43,840
How much time had passed since I had seen the 
girl? A few days? A week? I couldn't remember.

162
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:53,520
"'And how is your niece now?' I asked the 
landlady. 'I'm sorry, sir,' the landlady replied.  

163
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:03,040
'She was very ill last night and I took care 
of her. The poor girl made only one request.  

164
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:13,280
She wanted her bed to be moved. She wanted her bed 
to be beside the wall-the wall next to your room.  

165
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,880
So we moved her bed. This made 
her feel happier, poor thing.  

166
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:29,680
Then she touched the wall and smiled. 
A few hours later, she died.'"  

167
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,760
The expression on Dampier's face was terrible.  

168
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,400
There were tears in his eyes 
as he continued his story.

169
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,680
"When I heard this news, I 
nearly died too," said my friend.  

170
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:01,600
"I didn't know what to say. What had I done? I had 
sent my thoughts to the girl and she had answered.  

171
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:11,600
I had not called out in words. I had used 
occult philosophy-magic-to send her a message."

172
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,800
Dampier was silent for a few 
minutes. Then he went on.

173
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:30,000
"A few days later, I heard of my father's death," 
said Dampier sadly. "I left the apartment on  

174
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:41,040
Rincon Hill and came to his house-this house. It's 
been my home since then. I've been waiting here,  

175
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:50,720
in this tower, for ten years. I've been waiting 
for a visitor. I wasn't expecting to see you,  

176
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,320
but your visit wasn't a surprise. Necromantius 
tells us how signs are repeated three times.  

177
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:11,360
You've heard my story. You must decide if my 
story has happened because of a fatal triad.  

178
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:21,760
I heard the tapping twice before. The first time, 
I tried to find the person who made the noise.  

179
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,640
The second time, many signals were 
sent to me but I didn't reply.  

180
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:40,640
Now you've heard the tapping too. That was 
the third time. The fatal triad is complete."

181
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:53,360
I stood up and shook Dampier's hand. My friend 
knew that I understood his sadness and pain. He  

182
00:24:53,360 --> 00:25:02,480
pressed my hand with his fingers and smiled. I 
said goodnight. There was nothing more to say.

183
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,360
The next morning, a servant 
came from Dampier's house.  

184
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:21,040
He brought a sad message for me. My friend, 
Mohun Dampier, had died in the night.
 
 
 
 

185
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,659
- THE END -
