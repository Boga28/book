CHAPTER ONE
Mr Murdstone

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,850
I disliked Mr Murdstone the first time I met
him.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,530
Perhaps I was just jealous or perhaps it was
more than that.

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:21,380
Certainly he was a handsome gentleman with
dark hair and dark whiskers but there was

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,150
something in his eyes that made me feel uneasy.

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:32,340
He began to call at our house and then my
mother started putting on her prettiest dresses

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,080
and going out in the evenings.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,100
One such evening my nurse, Peggotty, suggested
that I go with her to visit her brother in

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,410
Yarmouth for a fortnight.

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,070
I agreed immediately, happy at the thought
of an adventure.

11
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:55,420
I did not realize how different things would
be on my return.

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,809
The day of our departure soon arrived and
Peggotty and I climbed into the carrier's

13
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,670
cart that was to take us to Yarmouth.

14
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:10,030
My mother and I kissed each other and we both
cried.

15
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:16,110
When the cart started off she ran after it
to ask for another kiss.

16
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:23,900
As we rode away I saw Mr Murdstone speak to
her disapprovingly and she lowered her head

17
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,830
submissively.

18
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,860
I shall never forget that holiday.

19
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:36,009
Peggotty's nephew, Ham, was waiting for us
when the cart set us down.

20
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:41,990
He swung me on his broad shoulders and took
us to their home.

21
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:47,770
The Peggottys lived in a boat that had been
taken from the water and made into a small

22
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,250
cosy home.

23
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,970
For a young boy like me it was magical.

24
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:03,720
My nurse's brother, Mr Peggotty, greeted us
warmly and introduced Little Emily, his niece.

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,650
Both she and Ham were orphans.

26
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:15,900
She was about my age with blue eyes and curls
and I quickly became devoted to her.

27
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,130
When it was time for me to leave we were both
inconsolable.

28
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:28,040
As we approached home, however, I became excited
about seeing my mother again.

29
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,480
She was not at the gate to greet me and Peggotty
led me into the kitchen.

30
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,120
Now I was worried.

31
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,450
'Where is Mama, Peggotty?

32
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,239
What has happened?

33
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,470
She isn't dead, is she, like Papa?'

34
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,200
Tears filled my eyes.

35
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,780
'Good gracious, no, Master Davy!'

36
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,900
she replied shocked.

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,120
'But there is something I must tell you.

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,290
You have a new pa!

39
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,620
Come and see him.

40
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,459
And your mama.'

41
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,510
We went into the best parlour.

42
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,180
My mother was sitting on one side of the fireplace
and Mr Murdstone sat on the other side.

43
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,120
As soon as she saw me, my mother smiled and
hugged me timidly.

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,220
'Now, Clara, control yourself,' Mr Murdstone
said.

45
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,880
She kissed me avoiding looking at me under
Mr Murdstone's watchful eye.

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,060
As soon as I could, I went to my room.

47
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:51,220
Miserable, I thought of how different things
used to be, how loving and affectionate my

48
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,150
mother had been under Peggotty's indulgent
eye.

49
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:02,970
I knew that happy life was over and I cried
myself to sleep.

50
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:09,400
I was awoken by my mother and Peggotty who
had been looking for me.

51
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,459
'Davy, what is the matter?'

52
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:16,330
my mother asked.

53
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,530
She tried to put her arms around me but I
pushed her away.

54
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,080
'Oh, this is your fault, Peggotty!'

55
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
she cried.

56
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,180
'You have turned my boy against me!'

57
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,160
I heard other footsteps and Mr Murdstone entered.

58
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,780
'Clara, my dear, remember yourself!'

59
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,280
'Oh, it is too much!'

60
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,030
my mother exclaimed.

61
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,680
'Can I not have some peace and happiness?'

62
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,389
Mr Murdstone calmed her with a kiss and I
saw immediately that she would do whatever

63
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,730
he said.

64
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,120
'Go downstairs while David and I talk.

65
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,030
We'll join you shortly,' he said with a smile.

66
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:18,070
When we were alone he asked me, 'Do you know
what I do with a disobedient dog?

67
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,370
I beat it.'

68
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:27,340
He gave me a hard look and I understood all
too well.

69
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:35,740
'Now, come downstairs and do not displease
your mother or me again.'

70
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,700
After dinner that evening Mr Murdstone's sister
arrived.

71
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:47,680
She was dark like him, with the same stern
look, but had a large nose and thick eyebrows

72
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,930
which almost met in the middle.

73
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:58,550
She had come to help my mother, and started
the next morning by rearranging all our store

74
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,380
cupboards.

75
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,940
From then on she took control of everything.

76
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:10,750
On the one occasion that my mother asked to
be consulted occasionally Mr Murdstone accused

77
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,090
her of being ungrateful and expressed his
disappointment.

78
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,500
It was enough.

79
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,810
My mother never protested again.

80
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,690
I resumed my lessons with my mother but these
were no longer the happy times they had been

81
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,770
before.

82
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:35,760
Mr and Miss Murdstone were always present,
always ready to criticize my mother for her

83
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,241
lack of firmness with me and myself for every
mistake.

84
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:44,720
Mr Murdstone made me nervous and forgetful.

85
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,479
My mother in turn became anxious.

86
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:54,080
When she thought no-one was looking she tried
to help me but was immediately rebuked by

87
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,919
Miss Murdstone.

88
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:03,100
My poor mother suffered as much as I did,
if not more.

89
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:09,830
This continued for several months until one
morning I entered the parlour for my lessons

90
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,140
and saw my mother looking more nervous than
usual.

91
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,440
Mr Murdstone was holding a cane in his hand.

92
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:25,690
'Now, David, you must be very careful over
your lessons today,' he said.

93
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:36,270
The effect was, of course, that I became particularly
forgetful and things went from worse to worse.

94
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,310
Finally my mother burst into tears.

95
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:49,620
'David, you and I will go upstairs,' Mr Murdstone
said, taking my arm.

96
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,099
My mother ran after us but Miss Murdstone
stopped her.

97
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,639
My mother's crying accompanied me up the stairs.

98
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,790
When we got to my room Mr Murdstone suddenly
pinned my head under his arm and raised the

99
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,050
cane in his other hand.

100
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,030
'Please, sir!

101
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,030
Don't beat me!

102
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,300
I'll do better!'

103
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,610
'Really?' he replied and hit me hard.

104
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,199
The hand holding me was near my mouth and
I bit it.

105
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,540
He beat me then again and again with renewed
fury.

106
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:34,330
I heard my mother and Peggotty crying outside
the door and then it was over.

107
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,830
He left me and locked the door behind him.

108
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,720
I was kept in my room for five days.

109
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:51,010
The only person I saw was Miss Murdstone who
brought me food but never spoke to me.

110
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,220
On the fifth evening I heard whispering at
my door.

111
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,460
'Davy, my darling?'

112
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,180
It was Peggotty.

113
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,540
'Oh, Peggotty!'

114
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,630
I cried.

115
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:10,340
'Hush or they will hear us, my lovely.

116
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,340
Listen!

117
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:17,470
You are going away to school tomorrow.'

118
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,420
CHAPTER TWO
School

119
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:26,050
I left after breakfast the following morning.

120
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:32,830
My mother, her eyes red from crying, embraced
me and told me to be good.

121
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:37,770
Then Miss Murdstone took me to the awaiting
cart.

122
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:43,330
It was the same carrier that had taken Peggotty
and myself to Yarmouth.

123
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,290
I cried heartily as we drove away.

124
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:54,570
Then, about half a mile from the house, Peggotty
suddenly appeared from behind a hedge and

125
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,830
got into the cart.

126
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:03,160
She hugged me tightly, put some cakes into
my pockets, and got out again, all without

127
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,810
saying a word.

128
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:12,050
I felt a little happier after this and even
more so when I found two half-crowns wrapped

129
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,130
in paper, sent with my mother's love.

130
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:21,420
As the morning progressed, I shared my cakes
with the carrier and learnt that his name

131
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,800
was Mr Barkis.

132
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,329
He asked a few questions about Peggotty and
then asked me to give her a message when I

133
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,870
wrote to her.

134
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,410
'What message is that.

135
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,649
Mr Barkis?'

136
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,240
I asked.

137
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,640
'Tell her: Barkis is willing', he replied.

138
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,829
I thought it a strange message but kept the
thought to myself.

139
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:51,570
I very soon fell asleep.

140
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:58,240
Mr Barkis set me down at the inn in Yarmouth
where, after some dinner, I took the stagecoach

141
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,420
to London.

142
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,800
We travelled through the night and I sat pressed
in between two gentlemen.

143
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,740
Unlike the other passengers I was unable to
sleep.

144
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,710
We arrived in London the next morning.

145
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:22,120
Nobody was waiting for me at the inn so the
coachman left me in the booking office.

146
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,940
I began to think I might never be claimed
and that perhaps this was Mr Murdstone's revenge,

147
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,210
when a thin young man entered.

148
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:40,910
His name was Mr Mell and he was a schoolmaster
at my new school.

149
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:46,110
Salem House was an unwelcoming, square brick
building.

150
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,589
As we crossed the courtyard I remarked to
Mr Mell how quiet it was.

151
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:54,930
He seemed surprised.

152
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,730
'Copperfield, don't you know it is the school
holidays?

153
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,760
There are no boys here, except you.'

154
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,100
Mr Mell left me in the classroom for a while.

155
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:15,690
It was a soulless, dirty, long, room which
smelt stale and unhealthy.

156
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:22,480
I walked up and down the rows of desks, noticing
the scraps of paper on the floor and the ink

157
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,300
splashed liberally about.

158
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:32,190
At one end of the room I saw a beautifully
written sign lying on a desk.

159
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,200
It said: "Be careful.

160
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,550
He bites."

161
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:45,279
I imagined it was for a fierce dog and felt
rather alarmed.

162
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,190
So I quickly climbed up onto the neighbouring
desk and proceeded to peer under the other

163
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,490
desks in search of it.

164
00:12:53,490 --> 00:13:00,730
When Mr Mell returned he found me like this
and asked what I was doing.

165
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,170
'I'm looking for the dog, sir,' I replied.

166
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,430
He looked at me gravely.

167
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:14,029
'I'm sorry, Copperfield,' he said, 'it's for
you.

168
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:19,959
I've been instructed to make you wear it.'

169
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:28,860
He helped me down from the desk and put the
sign over my head so that it hung on my back.

170
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,560
How mortified I was!

171
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,040
How I suffered!

172
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,720
I was glad there was nobody there to see it.

173
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:48,139
As the days and weeks passed I began to dread
the end of the holidays but it was inevitable.

174
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:53,890
Preparations were made for the boys' return
and one morning it was announced that the

175
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,360
headmaster, Mr Creakle, would return that
evening.

176
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,050
After supper I was summoned before him.

177
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:10,770
Mr Creakle, who was almost completely bald,
had an angry face with small eyes and nose

178
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,770
and a large chin.

179
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:21,149
He never spoke above a whisper and, judging
by the veins protruding on his forehead, the

180
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:23,630
effort cost him dearly.

181
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:31,220
'I know your step-father, boy,' he said, as
I stood before him.

182
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:38,920
'And I know something about you: you bite.'

183
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:50,470
I lowered my head and he continued: 'Let me
tell you something about myself - I'm a Tartar

184
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,740
and very determined.

185
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,670
I do my duty and make sure what I want done
is done.

186
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,360
Nobody stands in my way.

187
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,300
Do I make myself clear?'

188
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:12,579
'Yes, sir,' I replied, trembling under his
fiery gaze.

189
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,579
'Good.

190
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:19,050
Now go,' he replied.

191
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,330
I hurried away as quickly as possible.

192
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,430
The first boy I met was Tommy Traddles.

193
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:34,050
He found the sign on my back so amusing that
he immediately introduced me to all the other

194
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,019
boys as they arrived back.

195
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:43,740
However, the most important introduction took
place in the playground and was to a boy some

196
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:52,490
six years older than myself, who was respected
and admired by all the boys in the school.

197
00:15:52,490 --> 00:16:00,259
Steerforth, for this was his name, asked me
why I had to wear the sign and, hearing my

198
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,889
story, declared it was a shame.

199
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:10,399
I became devoted to him immediately and he
took me under his wing.

200
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,750
School was a sorry business.

201
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:20,690
Mr Creakle was indeed a Tartar and took great
delight in using his cane.

202
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:28,320
He seemed to particularly enjoy caning the
chubbier boys and a day never passed without

203
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,270
poor Traddles receiving a beating.

204
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:40,370
The only exception was Steerforth who Mr Creakle
never raised his cane to.

205
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:46,300
The months passed and finally the holidays
came and I went home.

206
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,720
I was so excited to see my mother and Peggotty.

207
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,300
My mother was sitting in the parlour when
I arrived, with a baby in her arms.

208
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:04,050
She looked thinner and more fragile than before,
although still pretty.

209
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,720
On seeing me she got up to embrace me.

210
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,760
'Davy, my boy!

211
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,829
I'm so happy to see you!

212
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:17,280
This is your little brother,' she said showing
me the baby.

213
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,720
Peggotty came running in then and held me
to her.

214
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,500
'Oh, Master Davy!

215
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,939
Let me look at you!'

216
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:35,110
That evening was the best day of the holiday
Mr and Miss Murdstone were not at home and

217
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,520
we three all dined together.

218
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,850
I told them about Mr Creakle and Steerforth
and we talked and laughed.

219
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:52,080
I almost believed Mr Murdstone did not exist
until we heard the door open later on.

220
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,740
My mother suggested I went to bed quickly:
Mr Murdstone did not approve of going to bed

221
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,390
late.

222
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:05,330
I said goodnight and slipped out of the room.

223
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,620
The next morning Mr Murdstone was sitting
in the parlour.

224
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:15,190
I approached fearfully and apologised for
biting him.

225
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:20,039
He accepted my apology coldly but nothing
changed between us.

226
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:24,350
The rest of the holidays were quite miserable.

227
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,160
Whenever I entered the room in the middle
of a conversation, Mr Murdstone or his sister

228
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:35,410
stopped speaking and became serious while
my mother looked anxiously from one to the

229
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,430
other.

230
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:44,250
I, therefore, tried to remain out of the way
and sat silently through meals.

231
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:50,570
This behaviour drew criticism too and if my
mother attempted weakly to defend me, she

232
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,630
was also rebuked.

233
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,840
Finally, the day came to return to school.

234
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,830
My mother came to the gate to say goodbye.

235
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:07,320
When I was sitting in the cart, she held up
the baby for me to see and stood that way

236
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,160
as we drove away.

237
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,990
I did not know it but this would be my last
image of her.

238
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:22,870
Now I must relate the saddest time of my life.

239
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:28,500
My birthday was about two months after my
return to school.

240
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,850
After breakfast, I was told to go to the parlour.

241
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:38,169
I imagined that Peggotty or my mother had
sent something for me but was conscious of

242
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:41,860
something like pity in the schoolmaster's
eyes.

243
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:48,890
Mr Creakle was still at the breakfast table
when I arrived but he quickly left the room.

244
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:56,809
His wife sat me down beside her and, with
a sad look, took my hand.

245
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:02,530
'My poor boy sit beside me.

246
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:11,280
I'm afraid I have some very sad news: your
mother has died.'

247
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,600
I cried long and hard while Mrs Creakle held
me.

248
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:25,669
The news quickly spread through the school
and I had the bitter satisfaction of a new-found

249
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:29,789
status among the boys.

250
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:37,980
CHAPTER THREE
Everything changes

251
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,250
And so the worst period of my life began.

252
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:48,730
I was sent home the next day but any hope
I had of finding much comfort there was immediately

253
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,820
dashed.

254
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:57,900
Mr Murdstone ignored my presence entirely
and sat consumed by his own grief while his

255
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,970
sister busied herself with practical matters.

256
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:08,640
I saw little of Peggotty except at night when
she sat by my bed and offered me the only

257
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,810
comfort I found under that roof.

258
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:21,190
The time before the funeral is confused in
my memory but I remember the day itself clearly.

259
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:27,890
I can still see the best parlour readied for
mourners and later the coffin containing my

260
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:33,890
mother and baby brother as it was lowered
into the ground.

261
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,380
That evening Peggotty came to my room.

262
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:44,280
She held me close and told me that my mother
had died in her arms, her last thoughts of

263
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,230
me.

264
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,750
The baby had died the following day.

265
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:56,720
The first thing Miss Murdstone did after the
funeral was over, was to give Peggotty a month's

266
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,020
notice.

267
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,530
Poor Peggotty was as upset as I was at the
thought of our separation.

268
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:10,020
After her departure I was almost entirely
neglected.

269
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:16,299
I ate with the Murdstones when they were at
home, alone when they were not.

270
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:22,530
Mr Murdstone tried to see as little of me
as possible, my presence, perhaps, irritating

271
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:29,740
his conscience, and I spent many lonely hours,
weeks, months.

272
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:36,799
Peggotty, now married to Mr Barkis, came to
visit as often as she was allowed but it was

273
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,960
never often enough.

274
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:46,720
Then, one day, Mr Murdstone decided I should
be sent to work in his business in London.

275
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,920
I was ten years old.

276
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:57,830
Murdstone and Grinby's warehouse was in Blackftiars,
on the waterfront.

277
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,350
It was an old building, overrun with rats.

278
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:08,850
My job, along with four other boys was to
wash, label and pack the bottles of wine the

279
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,100
warehouse shipped overseas.

280
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,559
For this I received six shillings a week.

281
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:23,090
Lodgings were arranged for me with Mr Micawber,
who I was introduced to on my first day.

282
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,880
He was a rotund middle-aged man with a shiny
bald head.

283
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,140
His clothes were shabby yet he had an air
of kindness.

284
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:43,890
Mr Micawber lived with his wife and four children
in a house which was as shabby as he was worked

285
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:50,100
from morning to night and spent all my earnings
on my breakfast and supper, which was often

286
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,080
an inadequate affair.

287
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,750
I was quite miserable at work, feeling the
full shame of my situation and the divide

288
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,390
between myself and the other men and boys
there.

289
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:10,750
I had no friends, so I became attached to
the Micawber family.

290
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:17,860
Mrs Micawber freely confided all of her husband's
financial problems to me and enlisted my services

291
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,150
in selling household possessions.

292
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:31,200
Thus I bore not only my own misery but also
my worries for this kind family.

293
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,150
Finally Mr Micawber's problems reached a crisis.

294
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:43,460
Unable to repay his creditors, he was arrested
and taken to a debtors' prison.

295
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:49,620
Soon afterwards the family furniture was sold
and Mrs Micawber and the children moved into

296
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,919
his cell with him.

297
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:58,830
I did not want to be separated from the only
family I knew in London so lodgings were found

298
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,970
for me near the prison.

299
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:08,370
After several weeks Mr Micawber was released
from prison and we were all reunited.

300
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:16,700
However, he decided to leave London and wasted
very little time in preparations.

301
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:23,700
We spent their last evening together and Mr
Micawber offered me some fatherly advice.

302
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:31,270
'My dear Copperfield,' he said, 'learn from
my mistakes.

303
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:36,770
Never put off until tomorrow what you can
do today.'

304
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,590
I promised not to.

305
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,920
After my friends left I felt I could bear
it no longer at Murdstone and Grinby's and

306
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,140
a plan formed in my mind.

307
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,060
I would run away.

308
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:57,870
I remembered my mother telling me about my
father's aunt, Betsey Trotswood.

309
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:04,480
Disappointed that I was a boy and not a girl,
she had severed all ties with my mother at

310
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,660
my birth.

311
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:12,000
Despite this, I decided to find her and ask
for her help.

312
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,711
I shall not relate my journey: how I was robbed
almost immediately of my possessions, how

313
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:24,830
I walked all day and slept in fields at night,
selling my jacket and waistcoat in order to

314
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,309
buy food.

315
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:34,850
It is enough to say that six days after I
left London I arrived, exhausted, starving

316
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:41,799
and half-clothed in Dover and began to enquire
after my aunt.

317
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:48,520
I was lucky and after no more than half a
day I was following her maid along a cliff

318
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,700
road to the pretty cottage in which my aunt
lived.

319
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:59,429
There, aware of my terrible appearance, my
courage failed.

320
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:05,850
Having stood outside for a while I was intending
to leave when an elderly lady came out of

321
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,279
the cottage.

322
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:17,659
She was wearing gardening gloves and a handkerchief
over her bonnet and held a large knife in

323
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:18,659
her hand.

324
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:19,659
'Go away!

325
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:20,659
I'll have no boys here!'

326
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:24,820
she said angrily before turning away.

327
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:32,020
I approached and, timidly touching her, said,
'Please, ma'am.

328
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,419
I'm your nephew, David Copperfield.'

329
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,179
'Good gracious!'

330
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:41,390
she exclaimed, sitting down quickly.

331
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:46,880
A series of emotions passed across her face.

332
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:54,710
I hurriedly told her all my story and then
burst into tears.

333
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:01,399
Seeing this she took me by the collar, led
me into the cottage and lay me on the sofa.

334
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:08,210
She then instructed her maid, Janet, to ask
Mr Dick to come downstairs.

335
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,980
Soon afterwards a grey-haired gentleman appeared.

336
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:18,029
'Mr Dick, do you remember my nephew David
Copperfield?'

337
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,720
she asked him.

338
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,260
'Well, this is his son and he's run away.

339
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,970
What should we do?'

340
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:35,350
Mr Dick considered for a moment and then said
'Give him a bath.'

341
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:42,860
And so I was bathed, fed and, much restored,
put to bed.

342
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,290
The following morning I entered the parlour
feeling quite hopeful.

343
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,980
My aunt was an austere woman but not unkind.

344
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,270
Perhaps she would let me stay with her.

345
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,250
'Good morning, David,' she said.

346
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,860
'I have written to your step-father and told
him to come.'

347
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,610
'Oh, must I go back?'

348
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,809
I asked, my voice failing.

349
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:13,409
'I haven't decided.

350
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:16,710
We shall see,' she replied.

351
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,020
My hopes died.

352
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:26,649
On the morning Mr Murdstone came, we were
sitting in the parlour.

353
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:31,880
Aunt Betsey suddenly saw a lady on a donkey
approach the house.

354
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,380
My aunt never allowed donkeys on the grass
and angrily shook her fist at the rider from

355
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,130
the window.

356
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:45,570
Recognising Miss Murdstone, I quickly informed
my aunt of the rider's identity.

357
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,010
'I don't care!'

358
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:54,070
she cried and ran outside, shaking her fist
again.

359
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:58,600
Mr Murdstone was walking up behind his sister.

360
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,960
They both looked at my aunt in surprise.

361
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,990
She ignored them and chased away the boy leading
the donkey.

362
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:13,320
Then she marched back into the house and waited
for Janet to announce the visitors.

363
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:22,899
'Miss Trotswood,' said Mr Murdstone on entering,
'I have come to take this ungrateful boy back.'

364
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:25,360
'Really?

365
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,630
David, are you ready to leave?'

366
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,600
my aunt asked me.

367
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,750
'No!

368
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:38,880
They never liked me and made Mama unhappy
about me too!

369
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,299
Please don't send me back with them!

370
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,400
I was so miserable!'

371
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,710
I exclaimed.

372
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:51,880
'This is ridiculous!' said Miss Murdstone
indignantly.

373
00:30:51,880 --> 00:31:00,769
'I wonder, would you treat your own son like
this and send him to work?' my aunt asked

374
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:02,140
Mr Murdstone.

375
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,049
'I can do what I like with the boy.

376
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:15,780
I must warn you, Miss Trotswood, if you decide
to keep him I shall close my door to him forever,'

377
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,899
Mr Murdstone said sternly.

378
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:21,630
'So be it!

379
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,720
I shall take my chances with him.

380
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,940
Good day to you both,' my aunt replied coldly.

381
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,340
'Janet, show them out!'

382
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:41,210
Furious, the Murdstones marched out of the
house and out of my life.

383
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:47,919
CHAPTER FOUR
A new life

384
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,870
My life now took a happy turn.

385
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:57,210
I became good friends with Mr Dick and my
aunt, who called me Trot, grew very fond of

386
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,840
me.

387
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,650
She decided to seek the advice of a certain
Mr Wickfield, her lawyer, regarding a suitable

388
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,909
school for me in Canterbury.

389
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:10,100
I accompanied her to his house.

390
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:16,760
When we arrived a pale youth of about fifteen
opened the door to us.

391
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:24,730
He had extremely short red hair, no eyebrows
or eyelashes and was bony and ill-proportioned

392
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,000
with skeleton-like hands.

393
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,630
His name was Uriah Heep.

394
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:34,620
'Uriah, is Mr Wickfield at home?'

395
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,159
my aunt asked.

396
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,919
He showed us into the study.

397
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,630
Mr Wickfield soon arrived.

398
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:47,700
He was an affable gentleman with white hair
and a complexion which suggested a little

399
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,019
too much port.

400
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:56,350
He was able not only to recommend a school
but to offer me lodgings in his house.

401
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:01,200
Then he introduced me to his daughter, Agnes.

402
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:09,549
She was about my age with a gentle face and
such a calm spirit that I have never forgotten.

403
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:14,600
I knew immediately that we would be friends.

404
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,100
So time passed.

405
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,070
I attended Doctor Strong's school.

406
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:26,080
It would be impossible to find someone more
different from Mr Creakle: Doctor Strong was

407
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:34,090
one of the kindest, gentlest men I have ever
known and my schooldays there were happy ones.

408
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:40,659
I was also happy living in Mr Wickfield's
house and grew close to Agnes, coming to consider

409
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:42,810
her as a sister.

410
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:47,790
The only person I did not like there was Uriah
Heep.

411
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:53,789
I had disliked him instinctively on first
meeting him and the years did nothing to change

412
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:55,299
this.

413
00:33:55,299 --> 00:34:03,200
He continually referred to himself as 'a humble
person' and had snakelike movements and ingratiating

414
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,190
ways which repulsed me.

415
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:13,020
Finally, the time came for me to leave school
and take my place in the world.

416
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,740
I was seventeen.

417
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:21,190
At my aunt's suggestion, I took some time
to think about what I wanted to do next, and

418
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,879
decided to visit my dear old nurse, Peggotty.

419
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:32,250
I took the stagecoach to London, stopping
for the night at an inn there.

420
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:39,490
As I sat near the fire, a handsome, well-dressed,
young man entered the room.

421
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:42,390
It was Steerforth!

422
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,730
'Steerforth!

423
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,349
Don't you recognise me?'

424
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:50,770
I asked, approaching him, hand outstretched.

425
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:56,139
He looked at me hard and then I saw recognition
light up his face.

426
00:34:56,139 --> 00:35:01,670
'Why it is Copperfield!' he exclaimed, shaking
my hand heartily.

427
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,089
'I'm so glad to see you!'

428
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:09,349
I said, tears coming to my eyes.

429
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:11,290
We sat and talked.

430
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:18,079
He was on his way from Oxford University to
see his mother and suggested I went with him.

431
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,480
I agreed happily and we set off the next morning.

432
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:30,079
I spent a delightful week with them during
which Steerforth taught me to ride.

433
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,349
When I finally made up my mind to continue
my journey, Steerforth decided to accompany

434
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:36,790
me.

435
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:41,200
And so, we travelled to Yarmouth together.

436
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:48,760
When Peggotty recognised me, joy spread across
her face and we fell into each other's arms.

437
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:56,050
Steertorth charmed Peggotty with his easy
ways and affection for me.

438
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:01,420
That evening, we all went to Mr Peggotty's
little boat and knocked on the door.

439
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,870
We could hear the sound of laughing and celebrating
coming from inside.

440
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:10,660
'Look who is with me, brother?'

441
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,550
Peggotty said, indicating myself.

442
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,450
'Why, Master Copperfield!'

443
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,900
Mr Peggotty exclaimed, shaking my hand and
then Steerforth's.

444
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,800
'What are you celebrating, if I might ask?'

445
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,770
I enquired, looking round the room at everyone.

446
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,310
'Such good news!

447
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:36,410
My Emily is to marry Ham!'

448
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:42,000
Mr Peggotty said happily taking Emily's hand
in his.

449
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,700
She blushed prettily.

450
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,210
What a beauty she had become!

451
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,520
Ham stood grinning with pride.

452
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,980
'Well!

453
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,440
Congratulations!'

454
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,170
I said, shaking his hand and smiling at Emily.

455
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:03,060
We spent a happy evening.

456
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,460
Steerforth entertained everyone with stories
of the sea.

457
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:13,060
Emily sat in a corner but observed and listened
to everything.

458
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:18,450
When we left her blue eyes followed Steerforth.

459
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:23,940
We remained in Yarmouth for a fortnight although
not always together.

460
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:29,200
I enjoyed wandering on my own and went to
visit my childhood home.

461
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:36,130
Sadly, I found the windows closed up and the
garden overgrown.

462
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,450
Steerforth spent a great deal of time with
Mr Peggotty, sailing.

463
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:48,200
At last, a letter arrived from my aunt, reminding
me of my purpose and inviting me to join her

464
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,650
in London.

465
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:55,859
It was decided: I would become a proctor.

466
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:01,640
My aunt found me a position as a clerk with
'Spenlow and Jorkins' and we found lodgings

467
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,140
nearby.

468
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:12,460
Imagine my delight when I met Traddles again
in London, lodging with my old friend Mr Micawber!

469
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,930
After a trial period, I was articled.

470
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:21,430
Mr Spenlow invited me to his house, Norwood,
for the weekend.

471
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:26,090
When we arrived, he immediately called for
his daughter.

472
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:29,720
We entered a room and there she was.

473
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,200
Dora Spenlow!

474
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,770
I fell in love instantly.

475
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,330
Later, we walked in the garden together.

476
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:45,960
She wore a straw hat and, had such blue eyes
and curls!

477
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:52,119
A little black dog, Jip, was by her side.

478
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:56,740
We made idle conversation and walked together
to the greenhouse.

479
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:03,790
There, she stopped to admire the geraniums
and, laughing charmingly, held Jip in her

480
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,790
arms.

481
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:12,310
I followed her from flower to flower, her
slave.

482
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,680
Dora became my life.

483
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:20,120
I thought of her constantly and walked along
the road to Norwood so many times hoping to

484
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:25,050
see her that I soon became well- known there.

485
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:29,400
I saw Steerforth occasionally when he came
up to London.

486
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,340
On one such occasion he brought me news from
Yarmouth.

487
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,000
Mr Barkis, Peggotty's husband, was dying.

488
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,079
I resolved to go to Peggotty and obtained
permission from Mr Spenlow.

489
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:51,020
In the days following Mr Barkis's death, I
helped settle his affairs for Peggotty and

490
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,220
then stayed for the funeral.

491
00:39:54,220 --> 00:40:01,190
That evening we were all to meet at Mr Peggotty's
house but Ham and Emily did not arrive.

492
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:07,280
After a while, I went outside and saw Ham
there, his head in his hands.

493
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,950
'Ham, what is the matter?'

494
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,410
I asked.

495
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,380
He looked at me with dead eyes.

496
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,610
'How can I tell him, Master Davy?

497
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:25,319
How can I tell him that Emily has run away?'
he exclaimed.

498
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:26,740
'Run away?

499
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,160
Where to?

500
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,579
Who with?'

501
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,000
I asked.

502
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,980
I looked at Ham's face and knew.

503
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,270
Steerforth.

504
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:46,450
You may well imagine the misery that I witnessed
that evening and the feeling of loss greater

505
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,690
than death that fell upon the house.

506
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:56,610
Mr Peggotty resolved to find Emily and never
rest until he did.

507
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:02,530
My sadness at the Peggotty's troubles weighed
heavily upon me and was lightened only by

508
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:06,250
an invitation to Dora's birthday party.

509
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,270
It was a picnic in the countryside.

510
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:17,410
A young man with red whiskers claimed Dora's
attention and in a state of jealousy, I flirted

511
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,349
with the nearest girl I could find.

512
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:24,180
I was miserable all afternoon.

513
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:29,180
I was planning to leave when Dora approached
with a friend.

514
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:34,500
'Mr Copperfield you are unhappy.

515
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:40,430
Dora so are you,' the wise friend said.

516
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:45,220
'Stop this silliness now before it is too
late.'

517
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:50,740
Without thinking I took Dora's hand and kissed
it and she let me.

518
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,650
I offered her my arm and we walked together.

519
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,940
I do not know where.

520
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:59,540
What joy!

521
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:04,010
The next day I determined to declare myself.

522
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:11,150
Alone with Dora I told her how happy I had
been with her the day before.

523
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:17,190
When she doubted it, I took her in my arms
and told her that I worshipped her.

524
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:21,490
Jip barked and growled but I did not stop.

525
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:25,180
I told her I could not live without her.

526
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:29,490
She cried and I held her more tightly.

527
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:35,150
Soon we were engaged.

528
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:40,200
CHAPTER FIVE
Dora

529
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:47,609
Apart from Agnes, to whom I wrote immediately,
and Dora's wise friend, Miss Mills, who she

530
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:52,530
was staying with, we told no-one of our engagement.

531
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:57,200
We met when we could and exchanged letters
daily.

532
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,930
We were so happy and in love!

533
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:06,770
However, this carefree existence did not last
long.

534
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:11,200
A series of events tested our love.

535
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,270
The first was the discovery that my aunt was
ruined.

536
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:22,089
I found her, and Mr Dick, sitting outside
my rooms one day.

537
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:29,030
This news was a terrible shock and I confess
my thoughts were not only for my aunt.

538
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:36,109
I was poor now too and not the same man Dora
had given her heart to.

539
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:41,770
My aunt stayed with me and we found accommodation
for Mr Dick.

540
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:47,420
I immediately spoke to Mr Spenlow about my
circumstances but he was unwilling to release

541
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,400
me from my articles.

542
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,140
Consequently I determined to find additional
work to support myself.

543
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,250
I was lucky.

544
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:04,520
My old teacher, Mr Strong, needed a secretary
and we arranged that I should work for him

545
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:09,780
for a couple of hours in the mornings and
evenings.

546
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,599
The following Sunday I went to confess everything
to Dora.

547
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,640
'My darling, could you love a poor man?'

548
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,940
I asked, kissing her hand.

549
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:30,160
'Don't be so silly, Doady,' she replied, calling
me by her pet name for me.

550
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,250
'I shall make Jip bite you if you don't stop!'

551
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:40,240
When she realized I was serious she began
to cry.

552
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,990
I comforted her and promised to work hard
and make everything right.

553
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:52,010
'Don't talk about hard work,' she said.

554
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:57,390
She was terrified by the idea and more so
when I suggested she learn something of how

555
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,339
to keep house and cook.

556
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:03,730
She trembled and cried.

557
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:08,910
I resolved not to worry Dora again with such
matters.

558
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:13,540
The second and third events came together.

559
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:19,920
Mr Spenlow discovered our relationship and
threatened to change his will if I refused

560
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,230
to give Dora up.

561
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,820
He gave me a week to consider.

562
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:32,160
That same night he set out for home but died
on the way.

563
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,970
Dora was distraught at her father's death
and refused to see me.

564
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:44,609
In fact there was no will, but there were
debts and Dora was sent to live with two old

565
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:46,609
aunts.

566
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:53,450
I was very depressed by my separation from
Dora and, seeing me in this state, my aunt

567
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:58,840
sent me to Dover to check on her cottage and
its new tenant.

568
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:03,950
I stopped in Canterbury on the way back to
visit Agnes.

569
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:07,140
Mr Micawber was now working for Heep.

570
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,680
He opened the door to me.

571
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,079
We talked for a while before Agnes arrived.

572
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:21,180
I confided all my problems to her and felt
peace in doing so.

573
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,079
She was always so kind and tender.

574
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:30,859
She advised writing to Dora's aunts, telling
them everything and asking for permission

575
00:46:30,859 --> 00:46:34,310
to visit from time to time.

576
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:41,470
I immediately saw the wisdom of her words
and resolved to write that day.

577
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:47,730
Uriah and his mother now lived in the house
and so were present at dinner.

578
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:53,480
I was conscious of them both watching Agnes
and me throughout the evening.

579
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,900
They seemed like a pair of evil bats to me.

580
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:05,390
The mother was constantly present the next
day too until, unable to bear her presence

581
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:09,250
any longer, I went for a walk to escape.

582
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,270
I soon heard footsteps behind me.

583
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,369
It was Uriah.

584
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:21,340
'Why do you and your mother keep watching
Miss Wickfield and I?'

585
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,400
I asked him.

586
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:30,500
'You are a dangerous rival, Mr Copperfield,'
he replied.

587
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,620
'Rival?

588
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:36,140
Do you think I consider Miss Wickfield other
than a sister?'

589
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:45,319
'Perhaps, perhaps not,' he said, 'but you
must know, I hope to make her mine one day.'

590
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:53,900
'She is as far above you as the moon,' I said
with feeling.

591
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:58,930
He smiled slyly.

592
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:05,609
That evening after dinner Mr Wickfield, Uriah
and I were alone.

593
00:48:05,609 --> 00:48:12,190
Uriah encouraged Mr Wickfield to drink and
proposed a toast to Agnes.

594
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:18,430
'Ah, Mr Wickfield, to be her husband....'

595
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:22,720
I heard a terrible cry from Mr Wickfield.

596
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,140
'Oh, this is torture!' he exclaimed.

597
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:30,809
'Is it not enough that I have let him into
my business and my house?

598
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:34,470
That I have lost my good name and reputation?

599
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,970
No, he wants my daughter too!

600
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,660
It is too much.'

601
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,350
'Be careful what you say!

602
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:52,110
Remember I know things, Mr Wickfield,' Uriah
said menacingly.

603
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,230
Agnes arrived then.

604
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,780
'Papa, what is wrong?'

605
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,780
she asked.

606
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:05,280
'Come, let me help you to bed,' she said,
then looked at myself and Uriah.

607
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,770
I left Uriah there too and went upstairs.

608
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:14,400
I was greatly troubled by what I had seen.

609
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,930
Agnes came to me later.

610
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:22,260
Her eyes were red from crying but she smiled.

611
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:30,670
'Agnes, promise me you will not think of sacrificing
yourself to Uriah.'

612
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,569
She smiled sadly and left me.

613
00:49:34,569 --> 00:49:38,760
I left the next morning full of concern.

614
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:44,030
The letter I wrote to Dora's aunts on Agnes's
advice bore fruit.

615
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,960
I was invited to call.

616
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,550
The aunts had considered my letter carefully
and would allow me to visit every Sunday and

617
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:55,140
twice during the week.

618
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,500
I agreed immediately.

619
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:01,110
Dora came in then.

620
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:06,400
How happy I was to see her and how she cried!

621
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:12,740
Let me turn my recollections to a later date.

622
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:17,990
I am twenty-one and Dora and I are married.

623
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:23,960
Among my other occupations I have begun writing
and Dora is never happier than when she sits

624
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,600
next to me in the evenings, a supply of pens
in her hand.

625
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:34,900
She feels she is helping me and I indulge
her, loving to see her so happy.

626
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,050
I remember it all so well!

627
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:45,960
We had a little house in Highgate but Dora
proved incapable of mastering accounts or

628
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,080
cookery.

629
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:52,560
One evening after a disastrous dinner she
sat on my knee with her arms wrapped around

630
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,330
my neck.

631
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:58,040
'Doady, I'm so sorry.

632
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,160
Will you do something for me?

633
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,589
Will you think of me as your 'child-wife'?

634
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:13,740
Then, when I do something wrong, perhaps you
will forgive me more easily,' she said, earnestly.

635
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:19,760
'My child-wife,' I said, holding her close.

636
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,960
I was rewarded by her beautiful laugh.

637
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:30,329
I never forgot this heartfelt appeal and,
although I sometimes wished she were more

638
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:39,330
practical, I learned to accept her as she
was and always loved her dearly.

639
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:43,940
In our second year of marriage Dora fell ill.

640
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:49,880
We thought she would soon be her old self
again but it was not to be.

641
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:55,880
She spent more and more time resting on the
sofa during the day and I carried her tenderly

642
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,680
to bed in the evenings.

643
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,780
News came of Emily.

644
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,460
She had been found!

645
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:10,430
Mr Peggotty thought it would be best for her
to start a new life far away and decided to

646
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:14,050
emigrate with her to Australia.

647
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:21,030
He asked me to accompany him to Yarmouth to
tell everyone and, leaving Dora in my aunt's

648
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:23,640
care, I agreed.

649
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:31,059
I did not feel I should be present when he
told Ham so I left him to break the news.

650
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:36,420
Later I saw Ham standing alone looking out
to sea.

651
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:41,530
We talked briefly but never directly about
Emily.

652
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:46,450
Feeling he wanted to ask me something I went
to look for him the next day.

653
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:52,420
'May I ask you something, Master Copperfield?

654
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,390
Should I see her before she leaves?' he asked
me.

655
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,740
'No, I don't think so.

656
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:04,910
I think it would be too hard for her,' I replied.

657
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:12,349
'If you want to tell her something, I could
write a letter for you, Ham,' I offered.

658
00:53:12,349 --> 00:53:14,660
'Thank you.

659
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:19,460
You are a gentleman and so much better with
words than I am.

660
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:26,400
I don't think I can forgive her or forget
her but I don't want to weigh heavy on her

661
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,640
heart.

662
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,640
Tell her that I'm fine.

663
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:37,960
Not that I shall ever marry or anything, but
I'm fine,' he said.

664
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,079
Poor, honest Ham!

665
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,940
I promised to write for him.

666
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:51,670
Mr Peggotty emptied his little home the next
day and packed the few things he wanted to

667
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:58,820
take away and we travelled back to London
together.

668
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:05,569
CHAPTER SIX
Endings and beginnings

669
00:54:05,569 --> 00:54:13,490
I shall now relate how Uriah Heep was exposed
for the villain he was but, to do so, I must

670
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,980
first go back a little in time.

671
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:24,670
Shortly before Emily was found I received
a mysterious letter from Mr Micawber: he was

672
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:29,710
coming to London and wished to meet with me
and Traddles.

673
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:35,960
We waited for him at the appointed time and
found him to be quite agitated.

674
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:40,611
Wanting to get to the bottom of things, I
invited him to come to Highgate with me, where

675
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:43,300
I would introduce him to my aunt.

676
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,740
He accepted.

677
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,790
My aunt and Mr Dick welcomed him warmly.

678
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:55,960
He was moved by their hospitality but was
clearly upset about something.

679
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,430
'Mr Micawber, you are among friends here.

680
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,900
Won't you tell us what is wrong?'

681
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,390
I asked him.

682
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:07,109
'What is wrong?

683
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:09,290
Heep, that is what is wrong!

684
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,890
He is a villain!

685
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:20,790
When I think of poor Miss Wickfield, so good,
so loving and her poor father...'

686
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:23,780
Here he became extremely agitated.

687
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:28,359
'I shall not rest until I have exposed him.

688
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:34,829
You must all come to Canterbury - one week
from now.'

689
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:39,570
He left us then abruptly, too upset to continue.

690
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:45,830
The next day a letter arrived repeating his
request and giving us instructions.

691
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:52,510
When the time came, my aunt and I were reluctant
to leave Dora but she coaxed us prettily,

692
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,760
saying she was not so very ill.

693
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,619
Not wanting to alarm her with our concerns
for her health, we agreed to go.

694
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:10,059
So, as instructed, we went to Canterbury and
called at the agreed time to see Agnes.

695
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:15,819
Mr Micawber opened the door to us, pretending
to be surprised.

696
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:19,049
Uriah certainly was.

697
00:56:19,049 --> 00:56:21,839
Agnes soon arrived.

698
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:29,140
Uriah then instructed Mr Micawber to leave
on some business but my old friend refused.

699
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:36,090
Irritated, Uriah called him a scoundrel and
threatened to dismiss him but still Mr Micawber

700
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:37,530
stayed.

701
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:42,770
'The only scoundrel here is you, Heep!

702
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,270
' Micawber declared.

703
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:50,310
Uriah looked at us all, surprised and then
suspicious.

704
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:56,180
Ah, this is a conspiracy, is it?

705
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:01,980
Well, Copperfield you always were jealous
of my rise.

706
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:07,260
Miss Wickfield, if you love your father, do
not join in this plot.

707
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:16,160
Miss Trotwood too, if you know what is best
for you,' Uriah said, dropping all pretence

708
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,670
of humility.

709
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:21,619
The change in him was astonishing.

710
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:28,319
With his mask off, all his hatred and malice
were apparent.

711
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:34,630
He seemed to grow in height like an evil genie
and I readily imagined him towering over poor

712
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,450
Agnes and her father, frightening them into
submission.

713
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:44,750
Or, as he had threatened, turning his attention
to my aunt.

714
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:49,480
He was dangerous like a cornered wild animal.

715
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:55,290
Unafraid, Mr Micawber took a burnt pocket-
book from his pocket.

716
00:57:55,290 --> 00:58:01,120
'My wife found this in the fire when we moved
into your house, Heep.

717
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,579
Do you recognise it?'

718
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:09,210
Uriah tried to snatch it but Mr Micawber was
too quick.

719
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:16,599
Addressing us he explained, it contains proof
of fraud and treachery carried out over a

720
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:18,740
number of years.

721
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:24,430
You see, Heep falsely obtained Mr Wickfield's
signature on important documents and has held

722
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:28,040
him in his power ever since.

723
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,290
First he obliged him to make him a partner.

724
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:36,850
Then he systematically forged Mr Wickfield's
signature on accounts and documents.

725
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:43,250
Poor Mr Wickfield lost his reputation with
his clients and investors and just recently,

726
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:49,369
believing himself bankrupt, signed a document
giving all of the business to Heep.

727
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:53,609
I have it here.'

728
00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:56,500
Uriah did not speak.

729
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:03,050
Agnes cried quietly, thinking of how her poor
father had suffered.

730
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:07,400
My aunt's reaction was quite different.

731
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,320
'So, you are responsible for ruining me!'

732
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,589
she declared furiously, trying to take hold
of Uriah.

733
00:59:16,589 --> 00:59:21,010
'It is quite clear what must be done,' Traddles
said.

734
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:24,799
'We must destroy the document giving Heep
the business.

735
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:30,770
Then, Heep, you must repay every penny you
have stolen.

736
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:37,680
If you don't, we can arrange for you to spend
some time in prison.'

737
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:46,349
I still remember the look of defeat and hatred
on Uriah Heep's face.

738
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:49,980
My darling Dora grew worse.

739
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:56,559
She no longer left her bed and my aunt and
I spent many hours sitting with her.

740
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:04,089
Yet she was always so happy and loving, never
complaining.

741
01:00:04,089 --> 01:00:09,569
Time rolls back and I can see it all so clearly.

742
01:00:09,569 --> 01:00:16,790
It is night and I am sitting by her bed holding
her hand in mine.

743
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:25,109
'Doady, I think I was too young and inexperienced
to be a wife.'

744
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:31,619
'Don't say such things, my darling,' I say,
laying my face on her pillow.

745
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:35,250
'No, Doady, it is true.

746
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:43,700
We are happy now but I am sure as time goes
on you will want more from your companion,

747
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,569
more than a foolish child-wife.

748
01:00:45,569 --> 01:00:50,119
It is better this way.'

749
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:53,809
'Oh, Dora don't!'

750
01:00:53,809 --> 01:00:58,790
I cry and she comforts me.

751
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:04,079
'Hush my sweet boy,' she whispers.

752
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,230
'Doady, I would like to talk to Agnes.

753
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:13,270
Can you send her to me?'

754
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:20,610
I leave reluctantly to fetch Agnes, who is
downstairs with my aunt.

755
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:25,390
I sit by the fire while Agnes is with Dora.

756
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:29,819
Jip, old now, is near me.

757
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:37,770
My thoughts turn to Dora's words and I feel
full of remorse for ever wishing her different.

758
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:42,710
I sit like this for I do not know how long.

759
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:50,280
Then Jip looks towards the stairs, whines
once and dies.

760
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:55,380
Agnes comes down soon after, tears running
down her face.

761
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:00,099
My Dora is gone.

762
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:06,490
My grief was frozen for a time, waiting to
explode fully.

763
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:12,809
I do not know how but it was decided that
I should travel abroad for a period.

764
01:02:12,809 --> 01:02:15,000
Preparations were made.

765
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,240
The time was nearing for Mr Peggotty and Emily
to depart too.

766
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:25,869
Mr Peggotty showed me a letter from Emily
to Ham and I offered to take it to him before

767
01:02:25,869 --> 01:02:27,530
they left.

768
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:33,040
So, once again, I went to Yarmouth.

769
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,410
There was a terrible storm coming.

770
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:41,869
I could not find Ham and, worried, returned
to the inn.

771
01:02:41,869 --> 01:02:49,380
Later, I was woken by voices calling out that
a ship was going down so, along with others,

772
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,369
I hurried to the beach.

773
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:56,829
The broken ship was hit by wave after wave.

774
01:02:56,829 --> 01:03:01,789
We watched helplessly as men disappeared under
the sea.

775
01:03:01,789 --> 01:03:07,360
Then I saw Ham and I understood his intention
immediately.

776
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:12,940
I tried to stop him but he pushed me aside
gently saying,

777
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:17,329
'If it is my time then so be it, Master Copperfield.'

778
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:24,770
With ropes around his waist, he went into
the water.

779
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:29,450
Only one man remained on the ship now, clinging
to a mast.

780
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:35,740
He waved his red cap in a gesture I thought
familiar.

781
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:41,900
Ham almost reached him but an enormous wave
hit the ship then.

782
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:47,970
The seamen pulled on the ropes and brought
Ham back to shore.

783
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:49,670
He was dead.

784
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:53,430
Poor honest Ham!

785
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:59,089
I remained with him until a fisherman asked
me to follow him.

786
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:01,309
'Is there another body?'

787
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:03,869
I asked.

788
01:04:03,869 --> 01:04:08,440
He did not reply but walked to the shore.

789
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:17,220
There, lying as he used to at school, was
my old friend Steerforth.

790
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:25,270
We carried his body to the inn and, in a dream-like
state, I travelled to break the news to Mrs

791
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:30,390
Steerforth and then directly on to London.

792
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:35,789
I was determined to keep the news of Ham's
death from Mr Peggotty and let them leave

793
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,099
happy.

794
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:43,339
Consequently I assured him that Ham had received
the letter and his thoughts were with his

795
01:04:43,339 --> 01:04:45,819
uncle and Emily.

796
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:49,950
Mr Peggotty boarded the ship.

797
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:56,089
As he waved goodbye from the deck I saw Emily
appear next to him and, placing her head on

798
01:04:56,089 --> 01:05:01,369
his shoulder, she waved too.

799
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:09,780
I travelled abroad from place to place, the
burden of my grief growing heavier and heavier.

800
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:17,930
I mourned my pretty Dora, my old friend and
kind-hearted Ham.

801
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:23,380
At times I wanted only to die and end my sorrow.

802
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:27,400
Then a letter from Agnes arrived.

803
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:36,800
Her gentle confidence in me gave me heart
and I slowly started to mend and to write.

804
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:44,059
My feelings for Agnes began to change, or
rather, I understood them better.

805
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:50,720
I realized I loved her and had always done
so.

806
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:57,940
I returned to England three years later and
went to my aunt's house in Dover.

807
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,809
We had an emotional reunion.

808
01:06:00,809 --> 01:06:05,800
Talking, I asked her if Agnes had a lover.

809
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,700
My aunt thought there was someone.

810
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:15,520
I was not surprised and I resolved to hide
my true feelings from Agnes, and this I did

811
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,299
in all my visits.

812
01:06:17,299 --> 01:06:20,839
It was Christmas.

813
01:06:20,839 --> 01:06:26,780
I had understood from my aunt that Agnes would
soon marry.

814
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:33,960
'Agnes, my sister, do you not trust me with
your secret?'

815
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,500
I asked her.

816
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:41,790
'Do you think I cannot be happy for you in
your marriage?'

817
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:45,160
Agnes became upset and started to cry.

818
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,000
Her look gave me hope.

819
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,160
'If I thought you could ever love me as more
than a brother...

820
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,349
you must know I love you.'

821
01:06:57,349 --> 01:07:00,710
'Oh, Trotwood.

822
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:03,690
I have always loved you!'

823
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:07,250
she said through her tears.
