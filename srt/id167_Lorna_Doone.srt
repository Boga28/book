CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,570
The end of school days
I am John Ridd, a farmer of the village of

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,440
Oare in Somerset, and I have a story to tell
you.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,350
It is about some things that happened to me
in my younger days.

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:27,230
On the 29th November 1673, when I was twelve
years old, John Fry, a worker from our family's

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,320
farm, came to collect me from my school at
Tiverton.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,770
He rode his horse up to the gate, leading
my own little horse behind him.

8
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,860
He was two weeks early, so I knew something
was wrong.

9
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,020
'What are you doing here, John?'

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,469
I asked him.

11
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,990
'It's not the holidays yet.'

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,880
He would not look at me.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,190
'Oh, I know that, young Master Ridd.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,220
But your mother has saved the best apples,
and cooked some wonderful cakes - all for

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,220
you.'

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,670
'And Father?

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,670
How is Father?'

18
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,070
I said.

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,080
It was usually Father who came to collect
me, and it was strange that John Fry hadn't

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,090
said anything about him.

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,500
'Oh, he's very busy on the farm just now,'
he said.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,470
But John wasn't his usual self, and I knew
this was a lie.

23
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:23,820
When I had packed my bags and said goodbye
to my friends, I got on my horse and we started

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,740
the journey home.

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,090
It was a long journey from Tiverton to Oare,
and in places the road was very bad.

26
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,979
John Fry still would not tell me why he had
come to collect me, or answer my questions

27
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,450
about Father.

28
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:43,870
He looked unhappy about something, but I tried
to hope for the best, as boys always do.

29
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:50,490
On the hill at the end of Dulverton town,
we saw a big coach with six horses.

30
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,450
In the front seat of the coach sat a foreign-looking
woman, and next to her was a little dark-haired

31
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,470
girl.

32
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,750
I could see from the girl's soft skin that
she was from a rich family, and I felt too

33
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,680
shy to look at her more than once.

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,340
She didn't look at me at all.

35
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,109
Opposite them sat a very beautiful lady, in
fashionable clothes, and next to her was a

36
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:16,909
little boy, who was about two or three years
old.

37
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:21,260
The woman in the front, I thought, must be
the servant of the family.

38
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,999
I always remembered the family after wards,
because I had never seen people who were so

39
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,799
grand, and so rich.

40
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:34,069
After Dulverton, the road got worse and worse,
and soon we came into a very dangerous part

41
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,769
of the country.

42
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:43,120
This was Exmoor, a place of high, wild hills
and deep valleys, and on Exmoor lived a family

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,559
of robbers called the Doones.

44
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:47,999
Everyone was afraid of them.

45
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:53,029
They had robbed and murdered on Exmoor for
many years, and had grown very strong.

46
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:57,659
Now it was getting dark, and a fog was coming
down.

47
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:02,609
It was just the kind of night when the Doones
would be out - and we were coming near to

48
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:05,599
the path that they always used.

49
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,839
I wanted to ride fast, and cross the Doone
path as quickly as possible, but John Fry

50
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,049
knew better.

51
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:18,150
'Go slowly and quietly,' he said, 'if you
want to see your home again.'

52
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,180
But when we came to the valley where the Doone
path was, we heard the sound of horses.

53
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,839
'Hide!' said John, and we rode our horses
off the path, and hid.

54
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:34,469
But I wanted to look at the Doones, and went
up onto a hill above the path.

55
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:37,049
From there I saw a frightening sight.

56
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,540
Below me, moving quietly, were thirty horsemen.

57
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,650
They were heavy, strong men, like all the
Doones, and they were dressed for battle,

58
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,430
carrying guns.

59
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,219
Tied to their horses were all the things they
had stolen.

60
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:56,869
Some had sheep or other animals.

61
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:02,049
But one man had a child across his horse - a
little girl.

62
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:07,309
She had on a very expensive dress, and I thought
it was probably for this that the Doones had

63
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:09,290
stolen her.

64
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,549
I could not see whether she was alive or dead,
but the sight of that child made me sad, and

65
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:15,549
angry.

66
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:21,269
When we got home to the farm, my father did
not come out to meet us, not even when the

67
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,509
dogs ran up and made a lot of noise.

68
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:28,699
'Perhaps he has visitors,' I thought, 'and
is too busy to come out.'

69
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:31,669
But really I knew this was not true.

70
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:33,699
I went away and hid.

71
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:36,530
I didn't want anyone to tell me anything.

72
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,180
I heard my mother and sister crying when they
came out to find me, but I could not look

73
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,759
at them.

74
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,340
Later they told me everything: my father had
been killed.

75
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,340
He had been murdered by the Doones.

76
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,130
It happened on his way back from the market
at Porlock, on a Saturday evening.

77
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,490
He was riding with six other farmers, and
the Doones stopped them and asked them for

78
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,969
their money.

79
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:07,130
The other farmers passed their money over
at once, but my father was brave.

80
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,550
He rode at them, waving his long stick above
his head.

81
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,300
He managed to hit quite a few heads, but one
Doone was waiting at the side of the road

82
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,090
with a gun, and shot him.

83
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,639
Although we knew it was the Doones who had
killed my father, it was useless even to ask

84
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,979
the local judges or law officers to do anything
about it.

85
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:32,020
They were afraid of the robbers, too - or
were even helping them.

86
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,060
The Doones did almost anything they wanted
on Exmoor.

87
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,970
They were not local people.

88
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,250
They came from the north of England, where
their leader.

89
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,379
Sir Ensor Doone, had been a rich man, with
a lot of land.

90
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:52,139
But he argued with his cousin, the Earl of
Lorne, who had even more land, and because

91
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,370
of the trouble he caused, the King took away
nearly everything that Sir Ensor owned.

92
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,730
A proud, angry man.

93
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:05,710
Sir Ensor refused to make peace with his cousin,
and without his land and farms he became very

94
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,979
poor.

95
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:12,289
Then he found that people who had once been
happy to know him now turned away from him.

96
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:17,080
After this, Sir Ensor lived his life outside
the law.

97
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,939
With his wife and family and a few servants,
he looked all over the country for a place

98
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:26,900
to live, where no one would know him, and
he could start again.

99
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:33,940
He chose Exmoor, where few people live, and
found the perfect place to build a new home.

100
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,979
This was the place we now call Doone valley.

101
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:45,060
It is a green valley far from any town, surrounded
by steep, Rocky Mountains.

102
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,669
At first Sir Ensor lived peacefully, and the
local people were friendly, even bringing

103
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:53,389
him presents of food.

104
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:58,580
But as his sons grew older, they did not want
to work as farmers, and they began to take

105
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,479
whatever they needed from the local farms
and villages.

106
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,580
They carried off farmers' daughters to be
their wives and give them sons, and so over

107
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,000
the years the Doone family became bigger and
bigger.

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,569
They began as robbers, but robbery had quickly
led to violence and murder.

109
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:23,189
The people of Exmoor were too afraid to fight
back because the Doones were big, strong men

110
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:28,860
and excellent fighters, and now only soldiers
could hope to break into their valley and

111
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,509
defeat them.

112
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,979
So there was no punishment for my father's
murderer.

113
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:39,050
We buried him quietly, and my mother was left
without a husband, to manage our farm and

114
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,599
take care of her three children.

115
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,680
We were too young to be of much help to her
yet.

116
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:52,699
I was the oldest, then there was Annie, two
years younger than me, then little Lizzie.

117
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,139
For a while, I wanted revenge.

118
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,069
I was strong, and growing stronger every day.

119
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:02,669
But my mother always calmed me down when I
talked of revenge.

120
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:08,169
She did not want to lose me too, and I used
to worry about what would happen to her and

121
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,189
my sisters if I were killed.

122
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:16,370
We tried to get on with our lives, but we
missed my father terribly.

123
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,870
Sometimes my mother and Annie would remember
him and cry, and sometimes John Fry saw me

124
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,780
with tears in my eyes - which I said was because
of the cold wind.

125
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,180
Lizzie, though she was the cleverest of us
all, was too young to really understand what

126
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,160
had happened.

127
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,849
So the months passed.

128
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:44,730
I learnt how to shoot with my father's gun,
and I worked hard on the farm to help my mother.

129
00:08:44,730 --> 00:09:02,740
CHAPTER TWO
A boy and a girl

130
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:09,000
Saint Valentine's Day, 1675, was the day that
changed my life forever, though I did not

131
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,550
know it then.

132
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,130
I was fourteen.

133
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:17,089
My mother had been ill and was not eating
very well, so I went out to find something

134
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:22,550
that she liked - good, fresh fish, caught
from clear water.

135
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:29,010
I went first along the Lynn River that runs
through our valley, then I turned into Bag

136
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,620
worthy Water.

137
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,360
Though I knew that this river led to Doone
valley, I did not think about it.

138
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,199
I went on catching fish and moving up the
river, then suddenly found myself standing

139
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:46,040
at the bottom of the cliffs outside Doone
valley.

140
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,660
In front of me was a waterfall, a steep hill
of smooth, fast-moving water.

141
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:59,230
It was a wild, lonely place, surrounded by
tall trees, and it was already getting late.

142
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:05,670
I knew I should turn for home - but I also
wanted very much to see what was at the top

143
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,010
of that waterfall.

144
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:13,050
It looked a dangerous climb, but if I did
not climb it, I would always remember that

145
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,000
I was too frightened to do it.

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,540
So I climbed.

147
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,200
The water beat against my legs, once knocking
me down so that I nearly drowned, but I pulled

148
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,430
myself up and went on.

149
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,800
When I reached the top at last, my arms and
legs were aching and my feet were cut by the

150
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
rocks.

151
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,620
I fell in the grass, exhausted.

152
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,270
When I opened my eyes, for a few seconds I
didn't know where I was.

153
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:47,610
But, kneeling beside me, touching my face
with a leaf, was a very young girl.

154
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:53,320
'Oh, I'm so glad,' she whispered softly, as
I sat up and looked at her.

155
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,640
'Now you'll try to be better, won't you?'

156
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,329
I had never heard as sweet a sound as this
girl's voice, nor seen anything as beautiful

157
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:07,380
as the large dark eyes that watched me, full
of care and wonder.

158
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,360
I stared at her without speaking, noticing
her long, shining black hair.

159
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,380
'What is your name?'

160
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,100
she said, 'and how did you get here, and what
have you got in your bag?'

161
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,600
'They're fish for my mother,' I said.

162
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,510
'Very special fish.

163
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,899
But I'll give you some, if you like.'

164
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:30,709
'Dear me - you're so proud of them, when they're
only fish!

165
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,960
But look at your feet - they're bleeding.

166
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,759
Let me tie something round them for you.'

167
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,149
'Oh, I'm not worried about them,' I said bravely.

168
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:41,709
'My name's John Ridd.

169
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:43,110
What's your name?'

170
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,839
'Lorna Doone,' she answered, in a soft voice,
and looked down at the grass.

171
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,220
She seemed afraid of her own name.

172
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,410
'Lorna Doone.

173
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,759
Didn't you know?'

174
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:00,910
I stood up and touched her hand, and tried
to make her look at me, but she turned away.

175
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,639
I felt sorry for her - and even more sorry
when she started to cry.

176
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,380
'Don't cry,' I said.

177
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,329
'I'm sure you've never done any harm.

178
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,990
I'll give you all my fish, Lorna, and catch
some more for my mother.'

179
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,660
But she looked so sad, with the tears running
down her face, that my heart ached for her

180
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,050
and I gave her a kiss.

181
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:30,339
At once my face turned red - here was I, just
a simple farmer's boy, but she, though young,

182
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:33,949
was clearly a lady and far above me.

183
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:37,470
She turned her head away, and I felt I should
go.

184
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,050
But I couldn't.

185
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,700
She turned back to look at me.

186
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,250
'You must go,' she said.

187
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,769
'They will kill us if they find us together.

188
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:51,860
You have found a way up into the valley, which
they could never believe.

189
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,980
You must go now, but when your feet are better,
you can come and tell me how they are.'

190
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,500
She smiled at me, and I could see that she
liked me.

191
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,670
We talked for a while longer, but then a shout
came down the valley.

192
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,490
Lorna's face changed from playfulness to fear.

193
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,139
We whispered our goodbyes, then Lorna ran
away from me and lay in the grass, pretending

194
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:15,640
to be asleep.

195
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,930
I hid behind some rocks, and saw twelve cruel-looking
men come walking down the valley, looking

196
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,970
for Lorna.

197
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,880
One of them - the biggest of them all, a man
with a long black beard - found her.

198
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,110
'Here she is,' he said.

199
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,810
'Here's our little Queen.'

200
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,560
He picked her up and kissed her so hard that
I heard him.

201
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,120
Then he put her on his shoulders, and carried
her away.

202
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,310
But as she went up the valley on the back
of this frightening man, Lorna turned and

203
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,180
secretly held up her hand to me.

204
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,160
Now I had to find a way out of the valley
and get home.

205
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,920
I almost broke my neck several times, climbing
down the mountain, and I did not get home

206
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,209
until long after dark.

207
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:03,910
My mother was angry with me, but I would not
say where I had been.

208
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,680
After my adventure, I thought a lot about
the strange little girl I had met in Doone

209
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,220
valley.

210
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,380
But I never really imagined I would go back
to the valley again.

211
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:28,020
So after a while I thought less about her,
and got on with my work on the farm.

212
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:41,069
CHAPTER THREE
Back to Doone valley

213
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:47,440
The months and the years went by, and I grew
very tall and strong, as my father had been.

214
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,490
By the time I had finished growing, I was
bigger than any man on Exmoor, and could pick

215
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:59,009
up John Fry with one hand and hold him in
the air - until he begged me to put him down.

216
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:05,430
My sister Annie grew more and more beautiful
every year, with her wide blue eyes and soft

217
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,850
brown hair.

218
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:13,240
She was so kind and so gentle that everyone
loved to be with her, and it is easy to understand

219
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,790
why my mother's cousin, Tom Faggus, fell in
love with her.

220
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,000
Tom Faggus was someone that our family was
both proud and ashamed of.

221
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,100
For a time he was one of the most famous robbers
in England, and people still tell the stories

222
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,110
of his adventures all over the country.

223
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:38,259
He had been an honest farmer once, but a rich
man had used the law to steal his farm, and

224
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:44,220
after that Tom took his revenge on all rich
men he met on the roads.

225
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:50,040
Perhaps that was why he was so popular with
the people, as he stole only from the rich,

226
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,449
gave generously to the poor and the sick,
and never hurt anyone in his life.

227
00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:01,709
While I was still a boy, he came to our farm
one day, asking my mother for food and a bed

228
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,130
for the night.

229
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:09,089
At first my mother told him to go away, fearing
that we children would learn bad ways from

230
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:12,529
him, but in the end she agreed.

231
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:18,440
'You may be a bad man in some ways,' she said
to him, 'but there are far worse than you.

232
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,450
So come and sit by the fire, and eat whatever
we can give you.'

233
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:29,439
Tom always had a smile and a good word for
everybody, and was great fun to be with.

234
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:35,910
All the time he was with us, I saw Annie looking
at him very kindly, and over the years we

235
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,319
had many more visits from him.

236
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:42,420
As for Lizzie, I never thought anyone would
fall in love with her!

237
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:48,420
She was small and thin, and perhaps a little
too clever - you never knew what she was going

238
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,310
to say next.

239
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,019
But I should not talk in this way about my
own sister.

240
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:59,029
My mother didn't seem to grow any older, and
was still pretty, and as good-hearted as ever.

241
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:05,000
She had never forgotten my father, and as
the years went by, she still sometimes cried

242
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,830
for him.

243
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:12,140
In all this time, if I thought of Lorna Doone
at all, it was only as a kind of dream.

244
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,260
And the Doone men went on robbing and killing,
just as they pleased.

245
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,220
Then one Christmas, when I was twenty-one,
my Uncle Ben was robbed by the Doones on his

246
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,930
way across Exmoor.

247
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:29,520
He had been coming to visit us, and when he
didn't arrive, my mother sent me out to look

248
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
for him.

249
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:37,710
I found him on a high, lonely path, tied on
to his horse with his nose to its tail.

250
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,040
He was very angry, and wanted revenge on the
Doones.

251
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,710
He asked me to show him where they lived,
so that he could learn the best way to attack

252
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,330
them 'when the time was right'.

253
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:56,580
So a day or two later I took him up into the
mountains that looked down on the valley.

254
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:01,650
I had not been back this way since I was fourteen,
and on the way, I thought of the girl I had

255
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:10,860
met in this valley -of her lovely dark eyes,
her sweet smile, her sadness... and her loneliness.

256
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:17,100
At the top of a steep cliff, we looked down
into the long, green Doone valley.

257
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,780
At either end was a narrow gap in the mountain
walls.

258
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,960
At the further end was the waterfall which
I had climbed seven years before, and at the

259
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,450
other was what we called the Doone-gate.

260
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,910
This was two rocky cliffs facing each other,
with only a narrow path between them.

261
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:42,140
It was like the gate of a castle, and it seemed
impossible to break into the valley.

262
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,390
But Uncle Ben saw a way.

263
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,670
'Do you see how you could attack them?' he
said.

264
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:54,010
'If you put big guns along the cliffs on both
sides, and fired down into the valley, you

265
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:58,250
could defeat the Doones in half an hour.'

266
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,260
But I was not listening to him.

267
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,540
I was looking across to the waterfall end
of the valley, and a little figure in white

268
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,650
walking there, someone who walked with a very
light step.

269
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,860
My heart began to beat more quickly, and the
blood came to my face.

270
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:22,530
In seven years I had half-forgotten her, and
she would never remember me, I thought.

271
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,960
But at that moment, once and for all, I saw
my future in front of me:

272
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,560
Lorna Doone.

273
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:35,260
On the way home I was quiet, and Uncle Ben
asked me many times what was wrong with me.

274
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,340
But I could not tell him.

275
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,950
The truth was, I had decided to go back into
Doone valley.

276
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:49,260
I waited until Saint Valentine's Day - the
exact day when I had first entered the valley.

277
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,970
Again, I followed the river, and again I climbed
the waterfall.

278
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,140
Although I was seven years older, the climb
was not easy.

279
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,810
When I got to the top, I looked around me
carefully.

280
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,790
In the early spring sunshine, the valley was
beautiful.

281
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,640
As I looked at the stream and the fields of
grass on either side of it, I forgot about

282
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:18,670
any dangers - and then I heard someone singing,
in a beautiful voice.

283
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:24,850
At first I hid behind a rock, but when I looked
out, I saw the lovely sight of Lorna Doone

284
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,780
coming towards me, along by the side of the
stream.

285
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,030
Her beauty frightened me.

286
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,750
How could I - only a farmer - talk to her?

287
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:41,000
But something seemed to pull at me and I came
out from behind the rock.

288
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,560
At first, she turned to run away, not knowing
who I was, but then I said, 'Lorna Doone!'

289
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,670
and she seemed to remember me.

290
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,120
A smile broke out on her face.

291
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,130
'I'm John Ridd,' I said, 'the boy who gave
you those beautiful fish, seven years ago

292
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,200
today.'

293
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,860
'Oh, yes - the boy who was so frightened that
he hid behind those rocks.

294
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,870
I remember.'

295
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,860
'And do you remember how kind you were, and
how you wanted to help me?

296
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:19,090
And then you went away, riding on a big man's
shoulders, and pretending you had never seen

297
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,120
me.

298
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,370
But you looked back and waved at me.'

299
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,630
'Oh, yes.

300
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:29,760
I remember everything, because it isn't often
I see anybody, except - I mean...

301
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,410
Well, I just remember, that's all.

302
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,840
But don't you remember, sir, how dangerous
this place is?'

303
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,750
But I couldn't answer her.

304
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:46,000
She had kept her eyes on me all the time - large
eyes, of a softness and brightness and beauty

305
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,100
that took my breath away.

306
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:54,430
I felt love taking hold of me - a love too
deep and too strong for words.

307
00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:00,130
How could I explain feelings that I did not
really understand myself?

308
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,920
She turned her eyes away from me.

309
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:08,170
'I don't think you can possibly know, John
Ridd, the dangers of this place, or what its

310
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,410
people are like.'

311
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,730
I could see that she herself was very frightened.

312
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:20,970
She was trembling, from fear that someone
might see me while I was there, and hurt me.

313
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:26,600
To tell the truth, I also grew afraid, and
thought I had better go and say no more, until

314
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,330
the next time I came.

315
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,980
I touched her white hand softly.

316
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,960
'Don't be afraid,' I said.

317
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,430
'I'll go now, but I'll come again soon, and
bring you some fresh eggs from our farm.'

318
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,310
She reminded me again of the danger.

319
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:51,020
'But,' she went on, 'it seems that you still
remember your secret way in,' and she smiled

320
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:58,000
at me kindly.

321
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:12,300
CHAPTER FOUR
Lorna's story

322
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,460
I went home with my head in the clouds, and
my heart on fire with love.

323
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,200
All that week I could not stop thinking about
Lorna, and I did my work on the farm in a

324
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
dream.

325
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,320
Soon, I went to see her again.

326
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,950
This time when she saw me, she came quickly
towards me.

327
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,910
'Mr Ridd, are you mad?'

328
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,910
she said.

329
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,270
'There are men on guard all-round the valley.

330
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,840
We must hide at once.'

331
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,580
She took my hand and led me to her secret
place, which was a kind of room hidden in

332
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,950
the rock of the mountain.

333
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:54,570
It was a green, peaceful place, open to the
sky above, but the only way into it was through

334
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,240
a narrow entrance in a cave.

335
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,380
I gave her the eggs I had brought her as a
present, and at this she began to cry.

336
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,570
'What have I done?'

337
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,670
I asked.

338
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,850
'It's nothing you've done,' she said.

339
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:13,840
'It's just a sadness that I feel when I see
anything from the world outside-and you've

340
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,580
been very kind, and I'm not used to kindness.'

341
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:24,410
I wanted to put my arms around her, and kiss
her, but I knew this would be wrong.

342
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:30,410
So I sat and listened, and I think this made
her like me more, because she began to tell

343
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,750
me her life story.

344
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:39,480
She told me everything - everything except
what her feelings were towards John Ridd.

345
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,510
'Only two people ever listen to me, or try
to help me,' she began.

346
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,020
'One is my grandfather.

347
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:55,010
Sir Ensor Doone, and the other is my uncle,
a clever man, whom they call the Counsellor.

348
00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:01,150
My grandfather is a very old and very hard
man - except with me.

349
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:07,070
He seems to know what is right and wrong,
but not to want to think about it.

350
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:12,650
And the Counsellor smiles a lot and talks
about what is right and good - but he never

351
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,550
does a good thing himself.

352
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:20,900
'My Aunt Sabina used to take care of me, and
she taught me very carefully.

353
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:28,050
She was a good person, honest and kind, and
when she died, it was like losing a mother.

354
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:33,740
Now there is only one woman I can talk to
- Gwenny, my servant.

355
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,860
She is my closest friend.

356
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:41,520
'I don't remember my father, but they say
he was the eldest son of Sir Ensor Doone,

357
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,620
and the bravest and best of them all.

358
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,760
They say, because of that, that I am their
"Queen".

359
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:55,520
'I dream of a world outside this one, Mr.
Ridd - a world of peace.

360
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,340
This valley is green and beautiful, but all
around me is violence and robbery, and stupid

361
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,720
behaviour.

362
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,510
I can't come down to their level.

363
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:11,790
I can't forget myself and live like them;
And strange questions come to me, that they

364
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,740
can never answer.

365
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:20,790
When I try to think about the past, about
my early childhood, I can't remember anything.

366
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:26,230
I want to know what I am, and why I am in
this place.

367
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,290
I suppose you think that's strange.

368
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:34,610
Perhaps people who are happy and at peace
don't need to ask questions like those.'

369
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,330
Here, Lorna began to cry again.

370
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,470
I could think of nothing to say, but I dried
her eyes for her.

371
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:48,830
'Mr. Ridd, I am ashamed and angry at myself
for talking so much, like this.

372
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:54,960
But you, who have a mother who loves you,
and sisters, and a quiet home, can't tell

373
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,651
how lonely it is to live as I do.

374
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:04,300
'I have this secret place to come to, because
I begged them for it.

375
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:12,100
Only grandfather and the Counsellor come here
- and sometimes Carver, the Counsellor's son.

376
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,590
No one in the valley is as strong or brave
as him.

377
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,540
But he is not like his father.

378
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:23,950
He is rough and violent, always quick to be
angry, and will listen to no opinion except

379
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,610
his own.

380
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:32,740
There is talk of him wanting to marry me,
but I would rather die than marry Carver Doone.

381
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,850
'Now you see how unhappy I am here.

382
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:41,390
I would escape, and go anywhere, but I know
it would hurt my grandfather.'

383
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,690
This was too much for Lorna, and she couldn't
tell me anymore.

384
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,340
She broke down and cried.

385
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:54,200
I talked to her gently and kindly until she
began to worry again about the danger I was

386
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,770
in.

387
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:01,210
I said I would come back and see her again,
but she made me promise not to come back for

388
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,780
another month - so that I would not add to
her problems with fears about me.

389
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:13,270
During that time, we agreed that if she were
in any danger, she would put a dark coat over

390
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,920
a white rock, near her secret room.

391
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:30,550
I would be able to see this from a hill above
the valley, and then I would come.

392
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:42,740
CHAPTER FIVE
To London

393
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,420
But I was not able to see Lorna again as soon
as I had hoped.

394
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:52,870
Before the month had passed, I was called
away from home, in a very strange and unexpected

395
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,870
way.

396
00:28:53,870 --> 00:29:00,000
One afternoon, as I was outside the house
feeding the horses, a stranger rode up to

397
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,090
our gate and shouted at me.

398
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:09,810
He was a tough-looking, hard-faced man, about
forty years old, with small, quick eyes, and

399
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:15,250
he was dressed very differently from the way
we dress in Exmoor.

400
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:22,580
He said he was looking for Plover's Barrows
farm, and a man called John Ridd.

401
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:28,880
When I told him he had found them both, he
introduced himself as Jeremy Stickles, a servant

402
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,380
of the King, and he gave me a letter.

403
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,290
I looked at him in alarm, but he said there
was nothing in the letter to worry me.

404
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:41,730
At the top of the letter, my name was written
in large letters.

405
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,290
I read:

406
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,260
To JOHN RIDD:

407
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:50,570
This letter is to order you to appear before
the King's judges in London, and tell them

408
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:57,880
anything you know about some matters which
may be harmful to the King and the country.

409
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,320
Jeremy Stickles seemed very pleased by my
fear and surprise at the letter, but he said

410
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,620
again that no one was going to hurt me.

411
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,740
All I had to do was tell the truth.

412
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:14,950
When my mother read the letter, she became
very worried and began to cry.

413
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,480
She wondered how the King had heard of me,
and what he wanted to do with me.

414
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,290
But Mr. Stickles, who wasn't really as hard
as he seemed, explained everything carefully

415
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,100
to her.

416
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,760
He told her that the King only knew of me
because the stories of my great size and strength

417
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,920
had reached even London.

418
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,890
He had heard I was a good man, and thought
I could help him, that was all.

419
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,750
This made my mother feel better, but I was
very unhappy.

420
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,790
I was thinking of Lorna.

421
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,370
How could I tell her I was going away?

422
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:52,960
I had promised not to go back to the valley
for a month, and that was still a few days

423
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,970
away.

424
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:58,020
But how terrible it would be if she came to
look for me at the end of the month, and I

425
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,990
was not there!

426
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:04,990
I would have to break my promise and go before
the agreed time.

427
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:10,370
Mr. Stickles was happy to stay at the farm
for one or two days, to try our good Exmoor

428
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,860
food.

429
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,590
So I used the time to look for Lorna.

430
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:19,280
But I saw nothing of her in the valley, and
no signal that she needed me.

431
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,120
There was nothing else I could do.

432
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,440
Mr. Stickles wanted to go, and I had to leave
for London without seeing her.

433
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,571
A journey to London was both long and dangerous
in those days, because of all the robbers

434
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:33,350
on the roads.

435
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:38,150
As I said goodbye to my mother and sisters
and took my last look at the farmhouse, I

436
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,970
felt very miserable.

437
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,040
But Jeremy Stickles was a good companion.

438
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,110
As we rode, he told me many amusing stories
of London life, and we became the best of

439
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,110
friends.

440
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,130
I did not like London.

441
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:56,750
It was a crowded, dirty place, not at all
like Exmoor - and, even worse, I had to wait

442
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:01,990
more than two months before the King's judges
were ready to see me.

443
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,420
There was a lot of trouble in London at that
time, with arguments between the King and

444
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,600
the City of London.

445
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,370
Nobody had time to talk to John Ridd, but
I was not allowed to leave and go home.

446
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:18,330
At last, I was called to see Judge Jeffreys.

447
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,350
Jeremy Stickles had told me about Judge Jeffreys.

448
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:26,690
He was the King's chief judge, and there were
terrible stories about him.

449
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:31,720
He became very angry if anyone argued with
him, and he had sent many of the King's enemies

450
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,990
to their deaths.

451
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:38,810
In the room I walked into, there were three
men sitting on high seats, and they were dressed

452
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,400
in very rich clothes.

453
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,220
In front of each of them was a desk, with
pen and paper.

454
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,150
The man in the middle seemed to be the most
important.

455
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:55,230
He was a big, heavy man, with a square chin
and a kind of fire in his eyes.

456
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:59,250
He was a man that almost anyone would be afraid
of.

457
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,720
This was certainly Judge Jeffreys.

458
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,410
He gave me a terrible stare, and asked me
who I was and where I came from.

459
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,840
When I had told him, he said:

460
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,850
'Well done, John Ridd.

461
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:15,100
You have answered me without fear.

462
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,070
I remember this matter now.

463
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,220
I will ask you some questions.'

464
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,110
He looked at me more closely.

465
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,690
'In Exmoor,' he said, 'there is a family of
robbers.

466
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,520
Is that true?'

467
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,210
I told him it was.

468
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:31,810
'And why isn't your local judge doing anything
about them?'

469
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,530
'I suppose he's afraid, my Lord.

470
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:38,900
The robbers are very strong, and their valley
is hard to attack.'

471
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,440
'But they must still answer to the law!'

472
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,890
Judge Jeffreys said.

473
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,740
'What's the name of these people, and how
many of them are there?'

474
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,620
'They are the Doones, and we think there are
about forty men in the valley.'

475
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,650
'I will do something about these thieves,'
he said.

476
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,770
'Perhaps I will come down to the west myself.'

477
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:05,030
But then he stared hard at me again, and asked:
'Is there any sign, in Exmoor, of any dislike

478
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,260
of the King?'

479
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,840
'No, my Lord.

480
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,059
We don't know much about him.'

481
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:12,080
That's a good answer,' he laughed.

482
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,919
'But the King knows he has enemies in the
country.

483
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:18,530
I see you know nothing about them, though.

484
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,579
You're a good man, John Ridd.

485
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:21,789
Keep out of trouble.

486
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:26,919
Keep away from the King's enemies, and from
the Doones as well, and you will be safe.

487
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:31,250
I was going to use you as a spy, but I see
you're too honest.

488
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,269
I will send someone else.

489
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:36,840
But never tell anyone what I've said to you.'

490
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:43,369
Here he stared at me very angrily, but when
he saw he had frightened me enough, he smiled

491
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:44,429
again.

492
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,470
'Now go home, John.

493
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:50,379
I will remember you - and I don't think you
will forget me.'

494
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:55,349
I had no money left to hire a horse for the
journey back to Exmoor, so I had to walk the

495
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:56,919
whole way.

496
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:10,579
It took me seven days, and I was very glad
to get home again.

497
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:20,670
CHAPTER SIX

498
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,329
Lorna's new troubles

499
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:28,859
When I arrived at the farm, Mother held me
tightly and cried for half an hour.

500
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:34,450
I gave everyone all the presents I had bought
for them in London, but of course what I wanted

501
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:39,760
to do most of all was find Lorna, and see
how she was.

502
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,901
I wanted to tell Mother all about her, but
the thought of my father's murder by the Doones

503
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:47,019
stopped me.

504
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:51,579
There was little chance that Lorna would love
me, so why should I worry my mother about

505
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:54,059
it?

506
00:35:54,059 --> 00:36:01,710
As soon as I could, I went to Doone valley
- but, there, I could not believe my bad luck.

507
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:08,240
When I looked from the cliff top, I saw Lorna's
sign - her coat on a white rock!

508
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,869
She had needed me, and now perhaps I was too
late to help her.

509
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:19,329
I climbed round the outer cliffs to the waterfall,
and was soon looking down towards the green

510
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:21,930
fields of the valley.

511
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:30,299
I stood and waited - not caring, now, if anyone
saw me - and then at last a little figure

512
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:32,859
came towards me.

513
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:37,400
I could see she was frightened, so I went
towards her slowly.

514
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,329
'Miss Lorna, I saw your sign on the white
rock, that you needed me.'

515
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:51,809
'Oh, yes, but that was a long time ago - two
months or more, sir,' and she looked away.

516
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:57,289
She looked so sad that I thought everything
was over between us, and tried to turn away

517
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:59,279
and go.

518
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:04,539
But when she saw that I was hurt and ashamed,
she ran towards me and took my hands.

519
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:07,170
'Oh John, I'm sorry.

520
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,329
I didn't mean to hurt you,' she said.

521
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:14,579
How happy I was, to hear her call me 'John'!

522
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:20,349
Then she led me away to her secret room, through
the cave in the mountain.

523
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:26,099
Since it was partly open to the sky, plants
and flowers were able to grow there, and now,

524
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,940
in the late summer, it was beautiful.

525
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:34,289
She could not look at me at first, but when
she did, I could see that she had been crying.

526
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:37,900
'My grandfather is not well,' she said.

527
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:44,410
'And now Carver Doone and his evil father,
the Counsellor, have more control over the

528
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,410
Doones.

529
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,599
They want me to marry Carver.

530
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,000
Not immediately - I am only seventeen.

531
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,190
But they want me to give my promise, in front
of my grandfather, that I will marry Carver.

532
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,310
They say it's for the peace of the Doones.

533
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:03,640
That's why I left the signal out for you,
Mr. Ridd.

534
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,490
They wanted to force me, but my grandfather
would not let them.

535
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:12,970
They won't do it - at least while grandfather
is alive.

536
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:18,260
But they're watching me, and following me,
and I can't go where I want any more.

537
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,579
Gwenny is helping me.

538
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:23,869
If she wasn't, I couldn't even be here, talking
to you.

539
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:27,819
But perhaps even you don't care about me anymore.'

540
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:33,150
Her eyes filled with tears, and I quickly
explained about my journey to London.

541
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:39,069
I told her how much I had missed her and how
I had worried about her all this time.

542
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:44,099
Then I showed her the present I had brought
her from London -a ring with blue and white

543
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,099
stones.

544
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:51,460
At first she cried even more, and then came
and sat so close to me that I began to tremble.

545
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:57,640
Then I picked up her hand and, while I was
pretending to look at its beauty and softness,

546
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,170
put the ring on her finger.

547
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,829
'Oh, Mr Ridd!' she said, her face going red.

548
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:09,290
'I thought you were much too honest and simple
ever to do something like this!

549
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,150
No wonder you are good at catching fish.

550
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:18,100
But no, John, you have not caught me yet,
not completely, though I like you very much

551
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:25,089
- and if you will only keep away, out of danger,
I will like you even more.'

552
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:29,700
With tears still in her eyes, which seemed
to come partly from wanting to love me as

553
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,230
much as I loved her, she kissed my head.

554
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:38,460
Then she gently took my ring off her finger,
and, kissing it three times, gave it back

555
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,670
to me.

556
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,370
'John, I cannot take it now,' she said.

557
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,559
'It would not be right.

558
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,410
I will try to love you dearly - as dearly
as you could wish.

559
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,940
Keep the ring for me until then.

560
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,420
Something tells me I will earn it -very soon.'

561
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:03,769
This time, I promised Lorna that I would not
come back to see her for two months.

562
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:10,130
If Carver or the Counsellor became violent
towards her, she would signal me as before.

563
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:16,760
Two months was a long time to wait, but because
of what she had said to me, I was happy.

564
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,780
Very soon after that I told my sister Annie
about Lorna.

565
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:27,519
I knew she would keep my secret, and it was
good to be able to talk to her about my troubles.

566
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:30,220
Then she gave me a surprise.

567
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:35,009
Tom Faggus had asked her to marry him, and
she had agreed.

568
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:41,559
But although Mother liked Tom, we both knew
she would not like her daughter to marry him!

569
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:46,260
And how would she feel about me wanting to
marry Lorna Doone?

570
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,920
We promised to help each other, if we could.

571
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,849
On the very first day after the agreed two
months, I went to find Lorna.

572
00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:02,999
But this time when I got to the top of the
waterfall, she was not there.

573
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:06,410
I waited for hours, but she didn't come.

574
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:09,800
Then I saw something that made me afraid for
her.

575
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:16,140
While I was hiding behind a tree, a big man
appeared, walking lazily down the valley.

576
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:22,849
He wore a wide hat, a dark jacket and tall
boots, and he carried a gun over his shoulder.

577
00:41:22,849 --> 00:42:27,930
As he came closer, I could see his face clearly,
and there was something 

578
00:42:27,930 --> 00:43:10,470
in 

579
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:16,539
it the ground beside them.

580
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:22,410
Here, the cliffs widened out into broken,
rocky ground, with deep shadows between the

581
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,720
rocks.

582
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:29,140
The guards were clearly not expecting an attack,
and were drinking and talking.

583
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:35,369
I stood and watched, and while I was wondering
what to do, they began to argue, and then

584
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:37,170
to fight.

585
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,789
This gave me my chance.

586
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:45,230
I went slowly along the cliff wall, and then
moved quickly into the shadows of the open

587
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,280
rocky ground.

588
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,509
The guards were so busy with their fight that
they did not see or hear me, and I was soon

589
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:57,319
past them and going down the hillside into
Doone valley.

590
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:02,650
Lorna had told me that her grandfather's house
was the first one after the gate.

591
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:09,519
So, carefully and quietly, I went towards
it and stood below one of the windows.

592
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:15,349
I could not shout or call out because there
were other guards around the small village,

593
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:18,059
but luck was with me that night.

594
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:24,100
Lorna came to the window, opened it, and looked
out up at the night sky.

595
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,920
I whispered her name.

596
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,220
She jumped in alarm, but then looked down
and saw who I was.

597
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,310
'John!'

598
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,310
she said.

599
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,069
'Oh, John, you must be mad!'

600
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:39,329
'I was going mad, because I didn't know what
had happened to you.

601
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:40,970
But you knew I would come.'

602
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,599
'I hoped you would!

603
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:47,680
But do you see they have put these bars across
my window?'

604
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,690
She put her hand out through them, and I took
it and kissed it, and then held both her hands

605
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,690
in mine.

606
00:44:53,690 --> 00:45:00,299
'Oh, John, you'll make me cry,' she said,
though I could see she had already been crying.

607
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:02,740
'We can never be together.

608
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,599
Why should I make you unhappy?

609
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:06,130
Try to forget me.'

610
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,660
'Never,' I said.

611
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:13,589
'If we want to belong to one another, Lorna,
no one can stop us - only God, if he wishes

612
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:14,589
it.

613
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:18,220
Now tell me, why have you been kept in prison
here?'

614
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,650
'My grandfather is very ill now.

615
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,240
I am afraid he won't live long.

616
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,450
The Counsellor and his son are the masters
of the valley.

617
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:32,470
They want me here where they can see me, so
that I can't escape from Carver; and Gwenny

618
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:37,750
is not allowed to move about now, so I couldn't
send you a message, or signal you.

619
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,690
You must watch this house day and night, John,
if you wish to save me.

620
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:48,470
There is nothing they wouldn't do, if my poor
grandfather - Oh, I can't think only of myself,

621
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,619
when I should think of him.'

622
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:53,029
'How can I leave you even one more night here,
Lorna?'

623
00:45:53,029 --> 00:45:54,029
I said.

624
00:45:54,029 --> 00:45:55,860
'You must, John,' she said.

625
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,650
'You're so brave, but I love you too much
to let you stay any longer.

626
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,180
Yes, it's true!

627
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,869
But I cannot leave my grandfather while he
is dying.

628
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:06,950
So, if you love me, John, you must go.'

629
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,599
'I'll go for now.

630
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:13,091
But when I hear that your grandfather has
died, I will come and get you out of here.

631
00:46:13,091 --> 00:46:17,539
If I promise to take you safely away, will
you come with me?'

632
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:18,960
'Yes,' she said.

633
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,470
'Of course I will.'

634
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:25,700
So now I took her hand in mine again, and
put my ring on her finger.

635
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:30,160
I had kept it in my pocket since the day I
had first brought it to her.

636
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,380
This time she kept it, though she cried and
held my hand tightly.

637
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,980
'Oh, John.

638
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,160
This can never, never be!'

639
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:47,330
she said.

640
00:46:47,330 --> 00:47:00,109
CHAPTER SEVEN
Lorna leaves the valley

641
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:05,980
I left Doone valley by my own secret route
and went home to make plans for bringing Lorna

642
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,579
to the farm.

643
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:11,849
It was time to tell Mother all about Lorna
and the danger she was in.

644
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:16,650
At first Mother was very angry and unhappy
at my news.

645
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:21,950
She talked wildly about going away and leaving
the farm, but after a time she began to calm

646
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,030
down.

647
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:28,259
'When you see her, Mother,' I said, 'I'm sure
you will love her like a daughter.

648
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:34,269
And I know she will love you with all her
heart - she is so good and gentle.'

649
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:37,349
Mother was too kind-hearted to be angry for
long.

650
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:43,760
She cried a little more, then smiled and said,
'Well, God knows what is good for us.

651
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,619
You must bring her here, John, and I will
teach her how to be a farmer's wife.'

652
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:52,020
Lorna and I had agreed a new signal.

653
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:57,059
There was a tall tree near her grandfather's
house, which I could see from the cliff top

654
00:47:57,059 --> 00:47:58,690
above the valley.

655
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:04,410
In the top branches of the tree there were
seven large birds' nests from the last summer.

656
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:11,069
Gwenny could climb like a cat, and if one
morning I saw only six nests, then Lorna's

657
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:15,779
grandfather was dead and she was in great
danger.

658
00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:17,809
It was a bad winter that year.

659
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:24,600
We had more snow than anyone could remember,
and on Exmoor the snow was soon so deep that

660
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,339
no one could walk on it safely.

661
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:31,990
I had to find a way to cross this, but I had
an idea.

662
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:37,259
Lizzie had once shown me a book about the
icy countries of the far north, where people

663
00:48:37,259 --> 00:48:39,499
wore 'snow shoes'.

664
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:45,009
The book had pictures of these wide, flat
shoes which stopped travelers' feet going

665
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:46,779
down through the snow.

666
00:48:46,779 --> 00:48:53,079
For the first time I thanked my sister in
my heart for reading so many books!

667
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:59,109
I found some wood and animal skins, and soon
I had made some snow shoes, like the ones

668
00:48:59,109 --> 00:49:00,779
in Lizzie's book.

669
00:49:00,779 --> 00:49:05,789
We had a sled on the farm, which we used when
the ground was covered in ice.

670
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:11,670
A horse could not pull it in this weather
- but, with my snow shoes, I could!

671
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:15,420
I could use it to carry Lorna and her servant.

672
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:21,859
Some days later I saw only six birds' nests
in the tree, and that evening I tied myself

673
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:24,809
to the sled, and left for Doone valley.

674
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:30,349
I took the sled to the waterfall, which was
now a fall of ice, and tied it up there.

675
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:37,829
Then I continued on foot, going around the
south side of the valley towards the Doone-gate.

676
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:42,329
But when I looked down, I saw there was a
quicker way to reach Lorna.

677
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:48,180
The sides of the valley, like everything else,
were covered in deep snow, and here the snow

678
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,180
was smooth and icy.

679
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:55,819
I looked around to check that there were no
Doones in sight, then sat down on the icy

680
00:49:55,819 --> 00:49:59,020
snow and pushed myself off.

681
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:04,660
In seconds I had slid all the way down the
mountainside, and landed in a hill of soft

682
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,700
snow at the bottom.

683
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:12,279
At Sir Ensor's house, I whispered Lorna's
name below the window, as before.

684
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:16,799
This time, Gwenny let me in, when she was
sure who I was.

685
00:50:16,799 --> 00:50:19,660
But inside I saw a terrible sight.

686
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:24,660
Gwenny looked almost mad with hunger, and
Lorna lay back on a chair, as white as the

687
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,310
valley all around us.

688
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:27,510
'Good God!'

689
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,239
I said, and ran to her.

690
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:33,920
I took her in my arms but she was so weak
that she could not speak at first.

691
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,059
'We've been kept in here for days without
food,' said Gwenny.

692
00:50:38,059 --> 00:50:42,400
'And they were going to keep us here until
Lorna agreed to marry Carver.'

693
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,609
'We must leave at once,' I said.

694
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:46,390
'Will you come with me, Lorna?

695
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,910
I promise to take you safely through the snow.'

696
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:51,380
Lorna' gave me her lovely smile.

697
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,749
'Of course I will, dear,' she whispered.

698
00:50:53,749 --> 00:50:55,190
'Of course I will.'

699
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,869
'And you too, of course, Gwenny,' I said.

700
00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:01,410
'Be quick now, and help me to get your mistress
ready.'

701
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:04,680
From outside, I had heard the sounds of singing.

702
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,400
There were usually guards around the house,
Gwenny told me, but tonight the Doones were

703
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,740
drinking and dancing to welcome Carver as
their new leader.

704
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:19,059
This would give us our chance - with all this
happening, the robbers would never notice

705
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:20,579
us leaving.

706
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:21,980
We were soon ready.

707
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:26,269
I picked up my beautiful Lorna and carried
her through the snow and the darkness to the

708
00:51:26,269 --> 00:51:27,989
other end of the valley.

709
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:33,930
Gwenny was able to follow us, putting her
feet in the places where my snow shoes had

710
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:34,930
been.

711
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:39,359
I made Lorna comfortable in the sled, with
her little servant beside her, and I told

712
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,950
her to hold on to Lorna tightly.

713
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:47,720
The waterfall was now a path of ice - very
steep and dangerous, but I was able to take

714
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:53,309
the sled down it, using my stick, and all
my strength, to stop it going too fast on

715
00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:54,309
the ice.

716
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:59,359
When we were down the waterfall, I tied myself
to the sled and began to pull.

717
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,580
It was hard work for me - but the best work
I had ever done in my life!

718
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:10,049
There was no time to lose, with Lorna so weak
from hunger and cold, so I pulled fast, and

719
00:52:10,049 --> 00:52:12,619
an hour later we were home.

720
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:16,480
My mother and sisters came to the door, and
helped me to carry Lorna in.

721
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,109
We put her in a chair by the fire, and gave
her some soup.

722
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:25,079
Then she slept, while I watched over her.

723
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,619
After a time, she began to wake up.

724
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:32,049
She put her trembling hands into mine, and
looked at me with so much love in her eyes

725
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:35,470
that I could not find the words to speak to
her.

726
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:40,999
We sat like this for several minutes, and
then we heard a little sound behind us.

727
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:44,769
It was Mother, crying with happiness to see
us so loving.

728
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:47,720
At this, Lorna got up and went to her.

729
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:52,349
She knelt beside Mother's chair and looked
up into her face.

730
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:54,420
Mother put her hand on Lorna's hair.

731
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,859
'My sweet child,' she said softly.

732
00:52:57,859 --> 00:53:03,569
A few days later, when Lorna and I were sitting
together by the fire, she said to me:

733
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:08,940
'John, you gave me a beautiful ring, and now
I want to give you something.

734
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,809
It is only a very poor, old thing, but it's
all I have.

735
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:17,109
My grandfather gave it to me before he died.

736
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:19,200
I hope you will take it.'

737
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,730
Then she put on my finger the strangest ring
I had ever seen.

738
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:26,021
It was very old, and there was a picture on
it.

739
00:53:26,021 --> 00:53:32,359
It was hard to see what the picture was, but
it looked almost like a cat in a tree.

740
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:43,339
'I shall wear it, my love,' I said, 'until
the day I die.'

741
00:53:43,339 --> 00:53:58,720
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Attack

742
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:05,619
Soon everybody in our part of Exmoor knew
that Lorna Doone was at Plover's Barrows farm.

743
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:09,670
So I knew the Doones would come looking for
Lorna as soon as they could.

744
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:13,210
But, for now, the weather saved us.

745
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:18,589
They could not move in the snow, and when
the rains came in spring, they had even bigger

746
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,109
problems.

747
00:54:20,109 --> 00:54:26,450
The rains were heavy, and when the snow also
turned to water, the rivers became very high.

748
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:30,240
In Doone valley the robbers' homes were almost
under water.

749
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,390
They needed most of their men to take care
of their village.

750
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:40,259
If they attacked us, we knew it could not
be with as many men as they would like.

751
00:54:40,259 --> 00:54:42,999
Spring also brought a visitor for Annie.

752
00:54:42,999 --> 00:54:49,119
The snows had kept Tom Faggus away from the
farm all winter, but now he came to see her,

753
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,930
and he had something to tell her.

754
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:55,359
'Before the snows came,' he said, 'I went
to London.

755
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,270
And I have something to show for it.'

756
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:00,499
Then out of his pocket, he took a letter.

757
00:55:00,499 --> 00:55:03,760
It looked very important, and had the King's
sign on it.

758
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,950
'What do you think it is?'

759
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:11,640
"We all looked at it, but it was full of long
lawyers' words and no one could understand

760
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,660
what it meant.

761
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:16,049
'I'll tell you what it means,' laughed Tom.

762
00:55:16,049 --> 00:55:18,930
'It means that I am not a criminal any more.

763
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:24,819
This letter says that the King is ready to
forget all my years as a robber, and I am

764
00:55:24,819 --> 00:55:26,779
a free man.'

765
00:55:26,779 --> 00:55:30,720
We all wondered how this could be, but then
Tom explained.

766
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,979
'I spoke to Judge Jeffreys.

767
00:55:32,979 --> 00:55:34,400
He knows me.

768
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,859
He said, '"If you promise never to rob again,
you can go free.

769
00:55:39,859 --> 00:55:45,180
There's enough for the King to worry about
in this country already, with all his enemies.

770
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:50,099
So if we can forget about you, that's good
enough for us."'

771
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:51,970
Everyone felt proud of Tom.

772
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:55,979
We thought it had been very brave of him to
go to Judge Jeffreys.

773
00:55:55,979 --> 00:55:59,140
But now he had something even better to tell
us.

774
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,950
With the money he still had, Tom had bought
some land.

775
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:07,410
He was going to live an honest life, and be
a farmer again.

776
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:12,970
So we were not surprised when Tom asked Mother
if he could marry Annie.

777
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:16,499
Mother was not very sure of the new 'farmer
Faggus'.

778
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:21,680
She was afraid that he would get bored with
farming and go back to being a robber.

779
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,760
But she could see that he loved Annie very
much, and between us, Annie and I managed

780
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,519
to persuade her.

781
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:31,630
Now we began to prepare for the Doones' attack.

782
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:37,200
Though the rivers were still high, people
had begun to see a few of the robbers out

783
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:42,640
on the roads, and we knew it would not be
long before we would have to fight them.

784
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,930
As we were preparing, we received another
visitor: my old friend Jeremy Stickles.

785
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:52,859
This time, though, he had not been sent to
find me.

786
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:59,400
To our surprise, he told us that he had been
spying in Exmoor for many months.

787
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,729
He had been sent down this way again by Judge
Jeffreys and the King.

788
00:57:03,729 --> 00:57:07,319
'You must not tell anyone what I'm doing,'
he said.

789
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:10,549
'But I have been sent to do important work.

790
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:15,640
The King has many enemies, and now I have
been given some soldiers -though only a few

791
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,489
- to help me look for them.

792
00:57:18,489 --> 00:57:23,619
But I have to ask you: can my soldiers and
I stay here for a while?'

793
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:25,579
I agreed immediately.

794
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:31,180
When the Doones attacked, it would be a great
help to have soldiers staying in the house.

795
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:37,270
I told Jeremy all about Lorna, and he promised
to help defend our farmhouse against any Doone

796
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,499
attack.

797
00:57:38,499 --> 00:57:40,989
The next day Stickles came with his men.

798
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:46,299
There were only six of them, but even to have
these was a help.

799
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:52,430
All we could do now was wait, and be ready
each night for an attack.

800
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:58,630
One day I came home late from the fields,
and found all the women trembling with fear.

801
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:02,180
Lorna had seen Carver Doone!

802
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,989
She had gone out in the evening to look at
some flowers by our stream.

803
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:12,859
There were thick bushes on the other side,
and when Lorna looked up, she saw two cruel

804
00:58:12,859 --> 00:58:15,519
black eyes staring at her.

805
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:18,359
She was too frightened to move.

806
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:23,200
Carver could not cross the stream because
the water was too high, but he lifted his

807
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,820
gun and fired at the ground by Lorna's feet.

808
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:34,460
'Unless you come back tomorrow, he said, and
tell me how to destroy that farmer, Ridd,

809
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:41,729
who will soon be a dead man because of you,
this will be the place of your death.'

810
00:58:41,729 --> 00:58:44,420
Lorna told us this, trembling.

811
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:51,290
We knew that Carver would not wait until tomorrow,
and we got ready for an attack that night.

812
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:56,380
When the Doones attacked a farm, they always
started fires in the hay ricks first - to

813
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,049
frighten everyone and show what they could
do.

814
00:59:00,049 --> 00:59:05,779
So when darkness came, I went with my best
gun and a heavy stick to one of the hay ricks,

815
00:59:05,779 --> 00:59:07,690
and waited beside it.

816
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:12,410
I had made sure that Lorna stayed in the house,
but little Gwenny climbed a tree near the

817
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:13,410
river.

818
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:19,460
From there she could see up the river to the
only place where it was possible to cross.

819
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:24,130
Soon the moon came up, and before very long,
Gwenny came running towards me.

820
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:27,680
'Ten of them, coming across the river,' she
said.

821
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,920
'They'll be here in a minute.'

822
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,160
'Go into the house and tell Mr. Stickles and
his men.

823
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,299
I'll stay here and watch,' I said.

824
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:40,019
The robbers broke down our gate, and rode
towards the house.

825
00:59:40,019 --> 00:59:46,119
I could see the soldiers hiding in the shadows,
waiting for the order to fire, but the Doones

826
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,550
then turned towards the hay ricks.

827
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:57,170
'Kill every man and every child, and burn
the farm,' came the deep voice of Carver Doone.

828
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,039
'Start over there.'

829
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:03,690
He was pointing to the hay rick where I was,
though he could not see me.

830
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:10,500
'But remember, Lorna is mine, and I will kill
any man who touches her.'

831
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:15,489
As Carver spoke, I pointed my gun at him,
but - will you believe me?

832
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:17,099
- I didn't shoot.

833
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:21,150
I had never killed a man, nor even badly hurt
one.

834
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,200
I did not think it was an easy thing to do.

835
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,529
Now, I can say that I wish I had killed him.

836
01:00:28,529 --> 01:00:34,499
But I put my gun down, and picked up my stick
- a more honest weapon than a gun, I thought.

837
01:00:34,499 --> 01:00:39,069
Two young Doones came towards me, with burning
sticks.

838
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:44,830
The first put his stick to the hay rick I
was standing near, and it started to burn.

839
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:51,749
I hit him on the arm, and heard his bone break
as he fell over with a shout of pain.

840
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:57,589
The other man ran to see what had happened,
and I took his fire stick and broke it.

841
01:00:57,589 --> 01:01:04,609
Then he jumped at me, but I caught him, broke
his arm, and threw him on top of his friend.

842
01:01:04,609 --> 01:01:09,660
I could still see Carver and wanted to jump
at him - but I knew he would simply shoot

843
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,250
me.

844
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:15,979
While I was thinking about it, there came
a loud noise and six tongues of flame from

845
01:01:15,979 --> 01:01:18,529
near the farmhouse.

846
01:01:18,529 --> 01:01:23,369
Stickles had ordered his men to fire at the
Doones as they came towards the house.

847
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:26,630
Two fell and the others ran back.

848
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:32,060
They had something to think about now; no
one had ever fought the Doones as we were

849
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,039
doing that night.

850
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:35,759
Now my moment had come.

851
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:38,720
I came out from my place near the burning
rick.

852
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:44,809
I knew Carver Doone by his size even in the
shadowy moonlight, and I took hold of him

853
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:45,869
by the beard.

854
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,740
'Do you call yourself a man?'

855
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,190
I said.

856
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:53,239
For a second he was too surprised to do anything.

857
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:56,549
No one had ever looked at him the way I did
now.

858
01:01:56,549 --> 01:02:01,809
He lifted his gun, but I was too quick for
him and knocked it out of his hand.

859
01:02:01,809 --> 01:02:05,530
'Now, Carver Doone, take warning,' I said.

860
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:12,430
'You think you are so much better than everyone
else, but you are no more than an evil robber.

861
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:14,890
Lie low in the dirt from which you came.'

862
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:19,309
Then I kicked his feet from under him and
knocked him down.

863
01:02:19,309 --> 01:02:24,980
When they saw that he was down, the other
Doones ran, but Carver simply got up and walked

864
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,170
away, shouting at me and everyone.

865
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:32,680
We wondered whether to chase the Doones, but
Mr. Stickles said it would be too dangerous

866
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,999
on the moor in the dark.

867
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:40,229
One thing was certain: the robbers had known
defeat that night on our farm - something

868
01:02:40,229 --> 01:02:44,500
they had never experienced since the day they
came to Exmoor.

869
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,609
And they went home without four of their men.

870
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:53,259
Two were dead, shot by the soldiers, and the
other two were the men whose arms I had broken

871
01:02:53,259 --> 01:02:55,430
by the hay ricks.

872
01:02:55,430 --> 01:03:00,480
We buried the dead men in the fields, and
Jeremy Stickles sent the two wounded men to

873
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:10,930
the prison in Taunton.

874
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:24,579
CHAPTER NINE
Lorna's true story

875
01:03:24,579 --> 01:03:27,329
The Doones' attack had been defeated.

876
01:03:27,329 --> 01:03:32,579
We knew that they would come again, as soon
as they could, in larger numbers.

877
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:37,160
But for now, Jeremy Stickles gave me something
else to think about.

878
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:43,380
My dearest wish was to marry Lorna as soon
as I could, but after Jeremy's story I began

879
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:47,059
to wonder if it would ever be possible.

880
01:03:47,059 --> 01:03:52,680
A few days after our battle with the Doones,
Jeremy said he had something to say to me.

881
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:57,239
'John, I didn't think the time was right to
tell you this before.

882
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:00,819
But now you must hear what I have to say.

883
01:04:00,819 --> 01:04:06,650
As you know, I've been riding around Exmoor
for many months, looking for information that

884
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:08,609
might be useful to the King.

885
01:04:08,609 --> 01:04:14,019
I remembered all that you told me about Lorna,
and I think I have discovered something about

886
01:04:14,019 --> 01:04:15,569
her.

887
01:04:15,569 --> 01:04:18,190
It may not be easy for you to hear, John.

888
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:19,349
Are you ready?'

889
01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:22,130
'I will do my best,' I said.

890
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:24,510
So he began his story.

891
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:30,930
'Six or seven months ago, before the snows
began, I stopped at an inn on my way from

892
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:33,640
Dulverton to Watchet.

893
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:39,749
The inn was all by itself, right by the sea,
and was very quiet.

894
01:04:39,749 --> 01:04:44,760
I was the only person staying there, and the
woman who owned the inn sat down and talked

895
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,099
to me during my meal.

896
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:51,390
She was dark and foreign-looking, and intelligent.

897
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:57,150
I was very interested to know how an unusual
woman like her had come to live in this lonely

898
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:00,329
inn, and she told me her story.

899
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:05,400
'She said that she was from Italy, and her
name was Benita.

900
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:11,170
Many years ago, while she was working in Rome,
she had met an English family.

901
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:16,400
They were travelling in Italy because they'd
had a terrible argument in England with another

902
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,579
family.

903
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:23,950
Benita did not know much about the argument,
except that it had been about land.

904
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:26,190
'Benita liked this English family.

905
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:29,779
They were very rich, but they were also kind.

906
01:05:29,779 --> 01:05:35,279
So when they asked her to travel with them
and take care of their children, she agreed.

907
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:40,710
She loved the children - a little girl and
boy - so she was very happy in her work.

908
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:43,079
'At first everything went well.

909
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:49,049
Together, Benita and the family travelled
up through northern Italy and into France.

910
01:05:49,049 --> 01:05:54,140
But on the French side of the Pyrenees, the
husband of the family had a riding accident

911
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:55,599
and was killed.

912
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:00,940
'His wife was deeply unhappy, and would not
move from the place where he had died for

913
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,839
many months.

914
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:09,400
But finally she decided to go home to England
and try to start life again.

915
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,660
Benita stayed with her, and they took a ship
to the Devon coast.

916
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:19,599
They stayed at Exeter, and then left in a
coach for Watchet, in the north of Somerset.

917
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,400
The lady had a house there, where she planned
to live.

918
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:28,880
'They were warned, at Dulverton, about robbers
on the roads, but the lady would not listen.

919
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:34,950
She even travelled at night, which, as we
know, is a very dangerous thing to do.

920
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:37,739
So of course they were attacked by robbers.

921
01:06:37,739 --> 01:06:40,040
It happened near the sea.

922
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:45,349
The coachmen drove onto the sand, and the
robbers followed on their horses.

923
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:50,979
The coach's wheels began to go down in the
soft sand, and as the robbers came nearer,

924
01:06:50,979 --> 01:06:56,089
the lady pointed to one of them and said:
"I know that man!

925
01:06:56,089 --> 01:06:58,589
He is our family's old enemy."

926
01:06:58,589 --> 01:07:04,579
'Then a great wave crashed against the coach
and turned it over.

927
01:07:04,579 --> 01:07:09,180
Benita hit her head on the door and could
not remember what happened.

928
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:15,089
The next thing she knew was that she was lying
on the sand and the robbers had gone.

929
01:07:15,089 --> 01:07:19,950
She looked around for her mistress and saw
her sitting on a rock, with her dead son in

930
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,839
her arms.

931
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,829
The little girl had disappeared.

932
01:07:24,829 --> 01:07:31,589
Benita and the two coachmen took the lady
into the town, but later that night, she died.

933
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:34,440
This is a sad story!' said Jeremy.

934
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,920
'Give me a drink, boy!'

935
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:40,220
I saw that there were tears in the brave man's
eyes.

936
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:42,650
'What was the lady's name?'

937
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,650
I asked.

938
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:45,440
'And what happened to the little girl?

939
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,739
And why did Benita stay there?'

940
01:07:48,739 --> 01:07:52,249
'I will answer the last question first,' said
Jeremy.

941
01:07:52,249 --> 01:07:54,710
'That's the easiest.

942
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:59,869
Benita stayed in that place because the Doones
- if that's who they were - stole everything

943
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:03,019
from the coach, and she had no money.

944
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:05,369
She could not go back to Italy.

945
01:08:05,369 --> 01:08:11,530
She married a man who lived near the place
because he was kind and could give her a home.'

946
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:12,940
'But the little girl, Jeremy.

947
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:15,140
What happened to her?'

948
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,540
'John - can't you see it?

949
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:20,330
You are more likely to know than anyone in
the world!

950
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:26,440
As certain as I sit here, that little girl
is Lorna Doone!'

951
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:31,940
The truth was, I had guessed this, almost
from the beginning of Jeremy's story.

952
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:37,040
But it was almost too painful to believe,
and I wanted Jeremy to say it.

953
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:42,310
When he described the coach leaving Dulverton,
the picture was very clear to me - because

954
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:47,900
I remembered that coach, with the foreign-looking
woman, the beautiful lady, the little boy,

955
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,940
and the young dark-haired girl.

956
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:57,480
I had seen them - on the day John Fry came
to collect me from school, on the day I learnt

957
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,290
my father had died.

958
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:05,339
I also remembered the frightening sight I
saw later that night: of the Doones riding

959
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:10,550
with the things they had stolen, and the one
with a little girl across his horse in front

960
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:11,560
of him.

961
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,210
I also remembered my anger.

962
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:20,660
Now I saw how the very same day had been the
blackest and unhappiest of both my and Lorna's

963
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:27,500
childhood days, and how from the very start,
our lives had been joined together.

964
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:30,290
But there was still one question to answer.

965
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:32,740
'What was the family's name?'

966
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,900
I said.

967
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:39,670
'The father was Lord Dugal - he came from
a very grand family.

968
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:41,350
But there is more to this.

969
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:45,190
Look at your ring, John - the one that Lorna
gave you.

970
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:49,340
Look at that strange sign, of a cat in a tree.

971
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:53,500
I saw that same sign above the inn door!

972
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,470
That is the sign of the House of Lorne.

973
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:59,490
It is the family that Lorna's mother came
from.

974
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:14,050
John, your Lorna belongs to one of the richest
and most famous families in England!'

975
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:25,400
CHAPTER TEN
Gone

976
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,260
Now I had to tell Lorna.

977
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:34,160
So, a day or two later, with an aching heart,
I went to tell her what Jeremy had said.

978
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:40,890
I'm afraid that some of my sadness was for
me, because now, more than ever, it was certain:

979
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:44,160
Lorna was far, far above me.

980
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:48,820
How could she possibly marry a simple farmer
now?

981
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:53,660
We sat in the garden, and she held my hand
while she listened without a word to what

982
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,320
I said.

983
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:00,480
But by the look in her beautiful eyes, and
by her trembling hand, I could tell how she

984
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,510
was feeling.

985
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:06,810
At the end, she turned away and cried for
her poor parents.

986
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:12,200
But she spoke not even one word of anger about
what had happened to them.

987
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:18,640
Then, to my surprise, she turned to me and
caught me in her arms and kissed me as she

988
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,840
had never done before.

989
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,060
'John, I have you.

990
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,860
You, and only you.

991
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:26,700
And I want no one else.

992
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:31,140
It does not matter how rich or important my
family is.'

993
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:36,540
It was impossible to doubt those clear deep
eyes, and bright trembling lips.

994
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:39,570
But I was afraid of what the future would
bring.

995
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:46,780
To me, she was Lorna Doone, but to the world,
she was Lady Lorna Dugal - young, beautiful,

996
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:47,990
and rich.

997
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:53,640
And if the world learnt about her, it would
want to take her away from me.

998
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:58,410
Now the date of Tom and Annie's wedding was
decided, and I went to Dulverton to buy a

999
01:11:58,410 --> 01:11:59,610
present for them.

1000
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:05,350
As I was riding, I had time to think more
about what Jeremy had told me.

1001
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:10,540
It was clear from his story that Lorna's mother's
family, the Lorne's, were the family with

1002
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:16,620
whom Sir Ensor Doone had argued about land,
before he came to Exmoor.

1003
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:21,930
This explained why Lorna's mother had called
him her 'old enemy', when she saw him that

1004
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:23,870
terrible night.

1005
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:28,890
And this must be why the Doones had carried
Lorna away and kept her, and never told her

1006
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:31,140
who she really was.

1007
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:36,160
If they could marry her to a Doone before
she learnt the truth, perhaps they hoped in

1008
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,810
this way to get the Lorne family's land.

1009
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:46,020
They would be rich and important again - and
at the same time have revenge on the Lorne's.

1010
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:52,040
But it would have to be a lawful marriage,
so Sir Ensor had taken good care of Lorna

1011
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,830
and kept her safe from the wild Doone men.

1012
01:12:54,830 --> 01:13:01,740
And Carver, seeing how beautiful Lorna had
become, had decided to marry her himself.

1013
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:06,410
In Dulverton I stayed with Uncle Ben, and
his granddaughter, Ruth.

1014
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:11,220
She was a beautiful and intelligent girl,
and had often been very kind to me.

1015
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:15,010
I did not spend too much money on a present
in Dulverton.

1016
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:17,660
I was saving for my own wedding to Lorna.

1017
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:23,430
I had told her that if her family's great
riches ever came to her, I would not touch

1018
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:24,800
any of her money.

1019
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,770
In fact, we had both agreed that we would
give nearly everything to the poor, and live

1020
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:31,160
simply.

1021
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:35,500
Three days later, dreaming hopefully of the
future, I walked into the kitchen at home

1022
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,960
- and saw immediately that something was wrong.

1023
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,120
Then Mother and Annie told me that Lorna had
gone.

1024
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,050
Two men had come from London.

1025
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:49,750
They were lawyers and had been sent by the
King's judges to take Lorna away.

1026
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:55,310
The judges had heard that she was still alive,
and they and her uncle had ordered her to

1027
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:57,010
come to London.

1028
01:13:57,010 --> 01:14:03,840
Her uncle was Earl Brandir - the last living
person in her family - and Lorna now had to

1029
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,300
live with him.

1030
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,080
She could not refuse.

1031
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:12,520
She was not yet twenty-one, so she had to
do what this uncle and the judges said.

1032
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,920
Of course, she had begged the lawyers not
to take her.

1033
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:20,780
But they said they had their orders, and they
could not wait for her to say goodbye to me.

1034
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:24,720
'Upstairs, by my bed, Lorna had left me a
letter.

1035
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,040
I ran up to read it.

1036
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:32,700
She said she loved me, and she said 'Goodbye',
and the letter finished like this:

1037
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:37,860
John, we have been through so many troubles
and dangers, but there is no doubt that we

1038
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,050
belong together.

1039
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:40,510
You must believe me.

1040
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:43,560
Whatever happens, I am yours.

1041
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,290
But I could not stop myself from thinking:
'It is over.

1042
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:53,580
Later, I wondered how the judges and Lorna's
uncle had heard that Lorna was still alive.

1043
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:58,510
Perhaps Jeremy Stickles had mentioned her
in his spying reports to the King and Judge

1044
01:14:58,510 --> 01:14:59,800
Jeffreys.

1045
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:04,700
Perhaps the Doones themselves had sent the
news to London - in order to get their revenge

1046
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,530
on me.

1047
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:11,350
The daughter of so famous a family would not
be allowed to marry a simple farmer and live

1048
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:13,960
quietly in Devon.

1049
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:18,580
Jeremy was away on one of his spying trips
now, so I could not ask him about it.

1050
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:22,340
But, anyway, there was nothing he could do.

1051
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:28,040
The weeks and months passed, and life on the
farm seemed lonely and empty.

1052
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:33,560
After Annie married Tom, and went to live
with him, I felt even more alone.

1053
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:38,000
Sometimes I used to go over and see her in
her new home, but it was not the same as having

1054
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:48,290
her by my side, the friend and companion from
my childhood days.

1055
01:15:48,290 --> 01:16:03,070
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Tom Faggus in danger

1056
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:08,010
We still lived in fear of another attack from
the Doones, and now that the soldiers had

1057
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:11,190
gone we had no one to help us.

1058
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:16,200
The main reason for their first attack - Lorna
- was gone, but I was sure that Carver now

1059
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:20,810
hated me with all his heart, and would destroy
us all if he could.

1060
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:25,170
However, Jeremy Stickles brought us some good
news one day.

1061
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:30,020
The King had at last agreed that the robbers
should be punished, and that Jeremy should

1062
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:32,940
do whatever was necessary to catch them.

1063
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:38,120
So perhaps the Doones were saving their strength,
preparing for a much bigger fight than their

1064
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,610
argument with me.

1065
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:43,740
Then something happened which made everyone
afraid for the future.

1066
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:47,030
Suddenly, King Charles the Second died.

1067
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:51,400
There was terrible trouble in England, as
everyone argued over who should be the new

1068
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,540
King, and soon fighting began.

1069
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:58,680
I wondered if all this would bring any danger
for Lorna.

1070
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,040
But the truth was, I knew very little about
her now.

1071
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:07,170
She had not written to me since the day she
had left, or even sent a message.

1072
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:10,710
I only knew what I had heard from travellers
in the town.

1073
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:15,720
They said that young Lady Lorna Dugal was
much talked about in London, as one of the

1074
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,120
most beautiful women in the city.

1075
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:23,250
I became more and more certain that she had
forgotten all about John Ridd, among the brighter

1076
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:24,720
stars of London.

1077
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,640
In June, the fighting became more serious.

1078
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:33,940
There was now a new King - James, the son
of Charles the Second -but many people in

1079
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:39,750
Dorset and Somerset were against him, and
had joined an army of rebels.

1080
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:44,960
There was no chance now that Jeremy Stickles
and his soldiers would fight the Doones.

1081
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,730
King James needed all his men to fight the
rebels.

1082
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:51,390
At first we were very worried.

1083
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:53,440
Surely the Doones would attack us now.

1084
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:57,650
But the Doones had seen a new hope for their
future.

1085
01:17:57,650 --> 01:18:03,360
They had joined the King's enemies, hoping
to win back their old land in the fighting.

1086
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:08,250
So they had sent most of their men to join
the rebels, and were too busy again to worry

1087
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:11,720
about the Ridds - at least for a while.

1088
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:18,500
As for me, I had decided that this battle
between the King and his enemies was not my

1089
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,790
fight.

1090
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:24,140
Most people in the towns and villages around
Oare were on the King's side and we gave no

1091
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:28,690
help to his enemies, but sensible people stayed
at home.

1092
01:18:28,690 --> 01:18:34,390
Too many men would die in the fighting anyway,
without our joining them.

1093
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:40,230
However, I did get involved in the troubles,
because one rainy day Annie came to see us,

1094
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:42,530
with some bad news.

1095
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:45,660
She ran into the kitchen, her face wet with
tears.

1096
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,250
'Oh, John!'

1097
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,250
she cried.

1098
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:49,740
'You must help me!'

1099
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:52,130
'Whatever is the matter, Annie dear?'

1100
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:53,130
I said.

1101
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:55,520
'It's Tom,' Annie cried.

1102
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:02,780
'He's gone to join the rebels, and you must,
oh, you must go after him and bring him back.'

1103
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,780
We had been afraid of this.

1104
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:10,280
Tom could not forget the excitement of his
old life and had become bored with farming.

1105
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:16,820
Mother was very unhappy and did not want me
to go, but I had to help my unhappy sister.

1106
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:22,080
And although I knew it would be dangerous,
I was quite glad of the chance of adventure.

1107
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,400
Perhaps - who knows?

1108
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:27,080
- I would learn some news of Lorna on my travels.

1109
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:31,910
So I promised to fetch Annie's husband home,
and early the next morning I rode away on

1110
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:33,780
our fastest horse.

1111
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:39,150
I went from town to town, asking for news
of the fighting, but it was four days before

1112
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:42,710
I finally found the two armies at Bridgwater.

1113
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:48,370
There had been a great battle the night before,
which the rebels had lost, and many of them

1114
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:51,920
now lay dead or dying on the battlefield.

1115
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,890
I shall never forget that terrible sight.

1116
01:19:54,890 --> 01:20:01,360
I thought Tom must be dead, and I walked all
over the battlefield, looking for his body.

1117
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:07,220
Several times I stopped in my search, to give
some poor dying man a last drink from my water

1118
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:08,650
bottle.

1119
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:14,610
After a time I found myself near an old farm
building, and I suddenly saw that the rider

1120
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:19,770
less horse standing in the doorway was without
doubt Tom Faggus's horse.

1121
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:26,580
I hurried into the building, and found Tom
lying on the ground, badly wounded.

1122
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:30,230
He could still speak, but only in a whisper,
because of the pain.

1123
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:36,910
'Put me on my horse, John,' he said, 'and
she'll take me home.

1124
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:40,520
No one can catch her - she's the fastest horse
alive.

1125
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:43,690
It's my best chance of escaping.'

1126
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:44,940
He was right.

1127
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:50,660
The King's soldiers were still riding around
the battlefield, looking for rebels to kill.

1128
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:56,120
So I tied up Tom's wound as best I could,
put him on his horse, and turned the horse's

1129
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,520
head for home.

1130
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,260
'Thank you, John.

1131
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:02,620
I am safe now,' he whispered.

1132
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:06,660
He lay along his horse's neck, to close the
wound in his side.

1133
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:09,520
'But look out for yourself, John Ridd.'

1134
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:16,980
I watched Tom's horse disappear into the distance,
and only a minute later I turned and saw soldiers

1135
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,720
coming towards me.

1136
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,830
'Stop,' they said, 'in the name of the King.'

1137
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:24,210
'I'm not a rebel,' I said.

1138
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:26,140
'I'm on the King's side and -'

1139
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:27,940
But they would not listen to me.

1140
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:34,130
'You are an enemy of the King,' they said,
'and the punishment is death.'

1141
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:39,060
I tried to argue with them, and as they laid
their hands on me, I knocked one soldier to

1142
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,530
the ground.

1143
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:46,530
This made them even angrier, and the captain
ordered his men to tie me to a tree and shoot

1144
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:48,480
me at once.

1145
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:53,440
There was nothing I could do against twenty
men, so I closed my eyes and tried to think

1146
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,000
about Lorna and my mother.

1147
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,330
The captain gave the order to fire, but at
the same moment I heard a horse coming towards

1148
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:05,100
us, and another voice shouting, 'Stop!'

1149
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,060
It was Jeremy Stickles!

1150
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:12,020
He rode his horse between me and the guns,
and started to argue with the captain.

1151
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:16,190
His voice was the sweetest sound I had heard
for a long time!

1152
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:17,940
The argument was soon over.

1153
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:23,370
I heard Jeremy mention Judge Jeffreys once
or twice, and before long he had persuaded

1154
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,390
the captain not to shoot me.

1155
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:31,100
'This man, John Ridd, is my prisoner,' said
Jeremy, 'and I shall take him to London for

1156
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,650
trial there.'

1157
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:39,270
As we rode away together, I thanked Jeremy
with all my heart for saving my life.

1158
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:41,830
'You're not safe yet, John,' he said.

1159
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:46,890
'I know you're not an enemy of the King, but
many people will not believe you.

1160
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:51,600
If you want to stay a free man and keep your
farm and land, there's only one thing you

1161
01:22:51,600 --> 01:23:05,980
can do - you must come to London with me and
tell your story to Judge Jeffreys.'

1162
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:17,390
CHAPTER TWELVE
Love and revenge

1163
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:24,370
London, of course, was where Lorna was, but
it was five weeks before I saw her.

1164
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:29,600
Because I was a kind of prisoner, I was not
allowed to move freely around the city and

1165
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,960
I had to report every day to the judges' rooms.

1166
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,810
However, I came before Judge Jeffreys at last.

1167
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:42,470
He remembered me, believed my story, and gave
me papers which said I was a free man and

1168
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:44,990
an honest servant of the King.

1169
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:50,800
I was now free to go and see Lorna but, to
tell the truth, I was a little afraid.

1170
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:56,120
It had been a year since she left Exmoor - a
year without one word or letter from her.

1171
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:59,890
Did she remember the old days in our farmhouse?

1172
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:05,310
Did she still love her poor, simple farmer,
a man without great riches or a famous family

1173
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:06,410
name?

1174
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:11,480
It was true that the Ridds had held their
own land on Exmoor for hundreds of years,

1175
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:16,720
but Lorna came from a family that had Scottish
kings in its history.

1176
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,850
Everybody in London knew Lady Lorna Dugal.

1177
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:24,890
They spoke of her great beauty, and told me
how rich she was, and that the Queen was very

1178
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:26,710
friendly with her.

1179
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:31,760
But if Lorna still loved me, then neither
riches nor a proud family would keep me away

1180
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,050
from her.

1181
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:39,060
So, with fear and hope in my heart, I went
to Earl Brandir's house.

1182
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:40,870
It was a very grand place.

1183
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:44,660
I was taken upstairs to a little sitting-room,
and told to wait.

1184
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:50,020
Then, suddenly, the door opened and Lorna
was standing before me, in a simple white

1185
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:54,020
dress, with her long black hair falling down
her back.

1186
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:56,560
She was more beautiful than ever.

1187
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,370
She came towards me, holding out her hand.

1188
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:03,980
Gently, I took her hand in mine, then bent
and kissed it.

1189
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:05,750
'Is that all?'

1190
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:06,950
she whispered.

1191
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:12,570
I saw the shine of tears in her eyes, and
in another second she was crying in my arms.

1192
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:16,600
'Darling Lorna,' I cried, holding her close
to me.

1193
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:20,710
'I love you dearly, but surely, you don't
care for me now.'

1194
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:22,480
'Yes, I do, John.

1195
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,810
Yes, I do.

1196
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:26,640
Oh, why have you behaved so unkindly?'

1197
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:31,330
'I am behaving,' I replied, 'as well as I
can.

1198
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:34,391
No other man in the world could hold you like
this, without kissing you.'

1199
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:41,210
'Then why don't you do it, John?' asked Lorna,
looking up at me, with a laugh in her bright

1200
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:43,040
eyes.

1201
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:47,710
After that, of course, there was no more talking,
for about five minutes.

1202
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:51,540
Then my darling pulled away from me, and began
to question me.

1203
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:56,480
'John Ridd, you must tell me the truth, the
whole truth.

1204
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:01,330
Why have you never, for more than a year,
taken any notice of your old friend, Lorna

1205
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:02,330
Doone?'

1206
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:08,690
'Because,' I answered, 'my old friend, and
true love, sent me not one word or letter

1207
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:09,860
in all that time.'

1208
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:11,640
'What!'

1209
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,640
cried Lorna.

1210
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,180
'Oh no, my poor John!

1211
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:19,710
I have often suspected something like this,
but she always said -' With these words, she

1212
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:25,510
rang a bell very violently, and a few seconds
later her servant, little Gwenny, came in.

1213
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:30,380
'Gwenny,' said Lorna, 'what have you done
with all the letters I gave you to send to

1214
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,860
Mr. Ridd?

1215
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,790
No more lies, now.'

1216
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:36,260
Gwenny gave me a very black look.

1217
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:39,560
'I didn't send them,' she said.

1218
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:42,040
'You're a grand lady now, mistress.

1219
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:46,800
You should marry some grand lord, not a poor
farmer from Exmoor.

1220
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,540
I was only thinking of you.'

1221
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:55,070
'Gwenny, you may go,' said Lorna, her voice
full of quiet anger.

1222
01:26:55,070 --> 01:27:01,290
'I don't want to see you or speak to you for
at least three days.'

1223
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:07,260
At this, Gwenny ran out of the room, crying
noisily, and Lorna turned to me.

1224
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:10,770
'Oh John, try not to be too angry with her.

1225
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:15,800
She loves me very much, and I'm afraid that
if you take me, you'll still have to take

1226
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,220
Gwenny too.'

1227
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:20,510
'I'll take fifty Gwennies,' I said, 'if you
want me to.'

1228
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:23,330
After this, we spoke of ourselves.

1229
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:29,200
I tried to tell Lorna that, when she was free
to decide her own future, she must think very

1230
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,210
carefully.

1231
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:34,620
The world would say she was mad if she chose
to become a farmer's wife.

1232
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:40,270
Of course, at Plover's Barrows farm she would
have a comfortable home, plenty of good food,

1233
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:42,930
and all the love and care I could give her.

1234
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:48,230
But it was not the same as being a grand lady,
who owned half of Scotland and who could marry

1235
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:50,570
any lord she wanted.

1236
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:52,270
Lorna could not wait for me to finish.

1237
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:59,380
'I decided long ago, dear John,' she said,
very seriously, 'that you must be my husband.

1238
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:03,990
I think it was the day you climbed up the
waterfall, with your shoes off, and a bag

1239
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:05,530
of fish for your mother.

1240
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:11,440
So, after all these years of loving, shall
little things like money and a family name

1241
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,740
separate us?

1242
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:14,570
They mean nothing.

1243
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:17,850
I have not been here a year, John, without
learning something.

1244
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:19,690
Oh, how I hate it!

1245
01:28:19,690 --> 01:28:22,740
Only my uncle and Gwenny really care for me.

1246
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:25,730
All the rest are only interested in my land
and money.

1247
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:30,320
Oh John, you must never leave me - it would
break my heart.'

1248
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:36,380
Of course, I gave in at once, and said, 'Darling,
you must do exactly what you please.'

1249
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:41,360
For that she gave me the sweetest of kisses;
and as I left, I went grandly down the great

1250
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:46,480
stairs of Earl Brandir's house, thinking of
nothing else except that.

1251
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:52,400
For the rest of my time in London I went to
see Lorna every day, forgetting all about

1252
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:56,400
my poor mother and the work that needed doing
on the farm.

1253
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:00,830
Then one day I received a letter from Lizzie,
and I realized that I must get home as quickly

1254
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:02,560
as possible.

1255
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:08,360
My darling Lorna cried and held me close,
but she understood why I had to go.

1256
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:13,150
Lizzie's news was this: Jeremy Stickles and
his soldiers had finally made their attack

1257
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:18,440
on Doone valley - but it had failed, and Jeremy
had been injured.

1258
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:21,490
This was the worst possible thing for Exmoor.

1259
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:26,630
Now the Doones would make more trouble than
ever before - and of course they would attack

1260
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:28,280
our farm.

1261
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:32,060
When I got home, I learnt that the Doones
were robbing everyone around them, and the

1262
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:34,380
whole of Exmoor was living in fear of them.

1263
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:38,550
Then a few weeks later something even more
terrible happened.

1264
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:43,820
The Doones came one evening to the farmhouse
of Kit Badcock, a neighbour of ours, while

1265
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:45,760
he was out working in his fields.

1266
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,240
They broke down the door and stole his young
wife Margery.

1267
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:54,760
Two of them carried her, screaming and fighting,
to their horses, and then rode away.

1268
01:29:54,760 --> 01:30:00,220
Meanwhile, the other Doones were searching
the house for food and drink to steal, and

1269
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:04,180
one of them found the Badcocks' little son
crying in the kitchen.

1270
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:09,420
He picked the baby up, threw him into the
air, and let him fall on to the hard stone

1271
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:10,420
floor.

1272
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:15,110
The child's neck was broken, and he died at
once.

1273
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:21,310
It made me sick just to think of the cruelty
of this man, and when people heard this terrible

1274
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:23,060
story, they were very angry.

1275
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:28,530
They said it was time for the people of Exmoor
to take their own revenge.

1276
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:32,430
Men from all the farms and villages of Exmoor
came to see me.

1277
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:37,690
'We cannot expect any more help from the King
against the Doones,' they told me.

1278
01:30:37,690 --> 01:30:43,490
'Because Jeremy Stickles's attack failed,
the King has refused to send any more soldiers.

1279
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:45,760
But we've had enough of the Doones.

1280
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:50,400
We want to attack them ourselves, and we want
you to lead us, John.'

1281
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,730
I said I was no leader, but they would not
listen to this.

1282
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:58,620
'Try to lead us,' they said, 'and we will
try to follow.'

1283
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:01,370
In the end I agreed to do as they asked.

1284
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:05,710
I thought we had a chance against the Doones,
if enough of us decided to fight.

1285
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:10,900
There were fewer of them now - some had been
killed in the rebel fighting, and some during

1286
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:12,750
Jeremy's attack.

1287
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:15,700
We arranged to meet again and make a plan.

1288
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:21,630
Tom Faggus, now quite well, rode over to join
us - and he soon had a very clever idea.

1289
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:26,830
'We're not soldiers,' he said, 'and we'll
never defeat the Doones if we try to fight

1290
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:28,850
all of them in their valley.

1291
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,800
So we must lay a trap.

1292
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,370
You know the caves on Exmoor where gold was
once found?

1293
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:40,170
Well, we'll tell a story around Exmoor that
men have been digging secretly and have found

1294
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:44,100
a new cave, with rocks full of gold.

1295
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:50,000
We'll say that the gold will be taken away
on a certain night, at a certain time.

1296
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,700
The Doones will naturally plan to attack and
steal this gold, but some of us will make

1297
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:57,910
a trap for them in the caves.

1298
01:31:57,910 --> 01:32:03,200
Meanwhile, the rest of us will attack the
valley, as soon as we know that some of the

1299
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,740
robbers have left.'

1300
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:10,920
The second part of our plan was this: Tom
would take some of our men and pretend to

1301
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:16,400
attack the Doone-gate, while our main attack
would really come from the waterfall end of

1302
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:21,110
the valley - the route I had discovered so
long ago.

1303
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:22,520
The plan went well.

1304
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:27,250
The story about the gold was whispered in
the right ears, and on the agreed night our

1305
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:33,190
spies watched a large group of robbers leave
Doone valley on their way to the caves.

1306
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:38,710
Meanwhile, as the moon rose above the hills,
I was leading my twenty men to the bottom

1307
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:40,860
of the waterfall.

1308
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:46,420
John Fry, our old farm-worker, was in the
mountains which looked down into the valley.

1309
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:53,010
When he saw the fighting start at the Doone-gate,
he would fire his gun as a signal to us.

1310
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:58,150
Soon the sound of John's gun rang around the
mountains, and I and my men climbed up the

1311
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:01,010
waterfall and into the valley.

1312
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:05,990
Tom's men were making as much noise as possible
at the Doone-gate, and all the Doones had

1313
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:08,490
run to join the fight there.

1314
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:13,710
We went quietly along the valley, keeping
to the shadows under the trees, until we came

1315
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:15,690
to the Doone-town.

1316
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:22,400
Then we got to work with our fire sticks,
and before long every Doone house was on fire.

1317
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:28,760
We took good care, however, to burn no women
or children, and we made sure that they were

1318
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:31,980
all out of the houses first.

1319
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:36,800
When they saw the flames and smoke rising
from their houses, the Doone men came running

1320
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,590
back from the gate.

1321
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:43,750
By the time they reached us, the whole valley
was burning - houses, trees, everything, right

1322
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:46,390
up to the sides of the mountains.

1323
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:50,750
As the men came towards us, we saw that there
were only twelve of them.

1324
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:56,150
In the bright firelight, they could not see
us, but we had them right in front of our

1325
01:33:56,150 --> 01:33:57,150
guns.

1326
01:33:57,150 --> 01:34:00,810
There were so few of them that I thought we
could take them as prisoners.

1327
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:06,170
But my men did not wait for a word from me
- they saw the chance of revenge on the men

1328
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:11,130
who had burnt their homes and stolen their
women for so many years.

1329
01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:14,300
They fired, and five Doones fell dead.

1330
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:19,520
The robbers fired back wildly, but they could
not see us clearly in the shadows.

1331
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:24,940
Soon all the guns were empty, and the battle
became hand-to-hand fighting, with knives

1332
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:26,220
and sticks.

1333
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:30,580
I stood to one side - the only Doone I wanted
to meet was Carver.

1334
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:36,670
But as I started to look for him, I saw something
white in the grass, moving close to the ground.

1335
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:41,050
I ran to see what it was, and found the Counsellor.

1336
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:46,950
I recognized him from Lorna's descriptions,
and here he was, on his hands and knees, trying

1337
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:48,810
to escape from the fighting.

1338
01:34:48,810 --> 01:34:53,520
The white thing I had seen was his long white
hair.

1339
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,960
When he saw me, he got to his feet.

1340
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:58,170
He knew at once who I was.

1341
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:00,490
'John Ridd!' he said.

1342
01:35:00,490 --> 01:35:03,450
'Won't you be kind to an old man?

1343
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:06,760
Let me get away from this violence, John.'

1344
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:11,690
'I will let you go free, sir,' I said, 'but
on one condition.

1345
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:15,410
Tell me honestly, which Doone killed my father?'

1346
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:21,400
'I will tell you honestly,' he said, 'though
it hurts me to say it.

1347
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:24,210
It was my son, Carver.'

1348
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:26,880
'I thought it was him,' I said.

1349
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:30,340
'But you were not there, so I don't blame
you.'

1350
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:37,200
'I've always been against violence,' the Counsellor
said, shaking his head sadly.

1351
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:41,170
'And now, John, let me go.'

1352
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:45,610
He was an evil, lying old man, but I let him
go.

1353
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:49,810
I don't know what happened to him, but he
was never seen again on Exmoor.

1354
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:54,180
Then I went to look for Carver, but did not
find him.

1355
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:59,820
Afterwards, I heard that he had led the Doones
who had gone to the gold caves.

1356
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:06,170
Our trap was successful, and all the Doones
had been killed - all except Carver, who had

1357
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:09,910
ridden his horse through the attackers and
escaped.

1358
01:36:09,910 --> 01:36:12,340
The Doones were totally defeated, though.

1359
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:16,590
When the sun came up above their valley the
next day, all their houses were nothing but

1360
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:18,290
blackened wood.

1361
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:24,670
We had lost sixteen men in the fighting, but
out of nearly forty Doone men, only Carver

1362
01:36:24,670 --> 01:36:27,670
and the Counsellor were left alive.

1363
01:36:27,670 --> 01:36:32,840
But the thought that Carver, that cruel and
violent man, was still living somewhere on

1364
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:42,140
the moors, did not give me much peace.

1365
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:56,880
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The last battle

1366
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:03,210
The next thing that happened was the return
of Lorna -my Lorna, my own darling.

1367
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:08,440
She stepped out of her coach and ran into
the house, as happy as a bird to get home

1368
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:09,440
again.

1369
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:15,430
All the house was full of brightness and sunshine
as she ran here and there, laughing and talking.

1370
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:21,460
Oh, how she loved this old chair, and she
must see the kitchen fire, and where was her

1371
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:23,530
old friend the cat?

1372
01:37:23,530 --> 01:37:29,670
As for me, I threw my best hat over the hay
ricks and shouted for happiness.

1373
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:33,110
Lorna was now free to make her own decisions,
she told us.

1374
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:35,420
Earl Brandir had died.

1375
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:40,400
She had grown to love this fine old gentleman,
and was very sad at his death.

1376
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:45,400
But now she could do what she wanted - even
marry that good servant of the King, John

1377
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,400
Ridd.

1378
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:51,360
At last, the waiting and the worrying was
over, and happiness was ours.

1379
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:57,360
But in her softest moments, when she was alone
with me, Lorna could not quite hide the fear

1380
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,420
that still lay deep in her heart.

1381
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:06,860
I felt it too - a fear that something evil,
something terrible, could still happen.

1382
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:12,110
There was great excitement all over Exmoor
when people heard of our wedding.

1383
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:16,520
Everyone had heard of the defeat of the Doones,
and the strength of John Ridd, and the beauty

1384
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:18,150
of Lorna.

1385
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:20,760
People came from more than thirty miles around.

1386
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:26,920
Mother, Annie, and Lizzie arranged everything,
with the help of Uncle Ben's granddaughter,

1387
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:30,010
Ruth, who had also come for the wedding.

1388
01:38:30,010 --> 01:38:35,100
When the day came, and Lorna stepped up to
my side in Oare church and took my hand, I

1389
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:37,150
was afraid to look at her.

1390
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:42,530
She was so beautiful, so fresh and lovely
in her simple white dress.

1391
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:47,740
But when we had each said 'I will', and my
ring was on her finger, we turned to each

1392
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:49,210
other.

1393
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:54,510
Her laughing eyes were serious now, and full
of so much love that my heart nearly stopped

1394
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:56,510
beating.

1395
01:38:56,510 --> 01:39:03,930
Darling eyes, the loveliest, the most loving
eyes - then the sound of a shot rang through

1396
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:10,020
the church, and those eyes were clouded with
death.

1397
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:15,160
Lorna fell at my feet, and her bright red
blood ran over the wooden floor.

1398
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:22,700
I lifted her up, whispering soft words of
love, but as she leant her head on my chest,

1399
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:28,380
her eyes closed and she breathed her last
goodbye to life.

1400
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:35,340
Then I laid my wife in my mother's arms - and
went out for my revenge.

1401
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:37,540
Of course, I knew who had done it.

1402
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:41,730
There was only one man in the world who could
do a thing like this.

1403
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:45,360
I jumped on my horse and rode away fast.

1404
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,480
I don't remember who showed me the way.

1405
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:49,510
I only know that I took it.

1406
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:52,880
And the men fell back before me.

1407
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,970
Soon the shouts of some men told me that I
was getting close.

1408
01:39:55,970 --> 01:40:03,020
And there, ahead of me, rode a man on a great
black horse; and I knew that the man was Carver

1409
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:04,020
Doone.

1410
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:08,900
'His life, or mine,' I said to myself; 'whatever
God decides.

1411
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:13,290
But the two of us cannot live in this world
one more hour together.'

1412
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:19,400
I had no weapons, and I knew he had a gun,
but I also knew, as surely as night follows

1413
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,850
day, that I would kill this man.

1414
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:25,800
He rode up onto the moors, and I followed.

1415
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:30,080
His horse was fast, but he did not know this
part of Exmoor.

1416
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:35,830
He rode straight into a little valley from
which I knew there was no escape - because

1417
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:41,830
at the end of it there was only a black, bottomless
bog.

1418
01:40:41,830 --> 01:40:47,070
As I rode after him, I reached up to a tree
that was growing in the rocks above me, and

1419
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:49,520
broke off a great branch.

1420
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:54,520
Then Carver turned a corner and saw what he
was riding towards.

1421
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:59,260
He pulled back from the bog in fear, and turning
his horse, he fired, and rode straight at

1422
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:00,570
me.

1423
01:41:00,570 --> 01:41:03,520
The bullet hit me somewhere, but I took no
notice.

1424
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:09,090
I put my horse across his path, lifted the
branch above my head and brought it down hard

1425
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:11,150
on his horse's head.

1426
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:15,170
Both horse and man crashed to the ground.

1427
01:41:15,170 --> 01:41:17,260
Before Carver could move, I jumped down.

1428
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:21,950
He got up with a black look on his face and
started to speak.

1429
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:25,380
For an answer I hit him on the side of the
face.

1430
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:29,240
I would not dirty my mouth by speaking to
this man now.

1431
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:32,920
Then he ran at me and put his hands around
my neck.

1432
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:37,820
I had never met strength like this, and felt
my neck would break.

1433
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:41,850
But I took hold of his arm, and almost pulled
it from his shoulder.

1434
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:45,940
Then I took him by the neck, as he had done
to me.

1435
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:50,280
His eyes burned with anger, and he threw himself
against me.

1436
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:53,030
But God gave me great strength that day.

1437
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:56,610
In two minutes he was lying on the ground,
half dead.

1438
01:41:56,610 --> 01:42:01,470
'I will not hurt you anymore,' I said, when
I could breathe again.

1439
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:05,100
'Carver Doone, you are beaten.

1440
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:11,810
Go on your way, thank God you are alive - and
never come near me again.'

1441
01:42:11,810 --> 01:42:12,910
But it was too late.

1442
01:42:12,910 --> 01:42:16,360
The black bog had him by the feet.

1443
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:22,180
As he lay like a mad dog in front of me, the
ground itself began to pull him in.

1444
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:25,720
In our murderous battle, we had not noticed
where we were going.

1445
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:31,820
I only just managed to jump, with my last
strength, from the terrible blackness.

1446
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:34,270
But I could do nothing for Carver.

1447
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:40,660
While his mad eyes stared, and his arms waved
wildly above his head, the black bog pulled

1448
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:45,150
him down and he disappeared from sight.

1449
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:47,400
I don't know how I got home.

1450
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:49,910
I had lost a lot of blood.

1451
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:54,200
By the time I got to the farm, I was riding
in a dream.

1452
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:58,120
John Fry took my horse away and Mother led
me indoors.

1453
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:04,050
'I have killed him,' I said, 'as he killed
Lorna.

1454
01:43:04,050 --> 01:43:06,730
Now let me see my wife.

1455
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:09,380
She belongs to me, though she is dead.'

1456
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:14,090
'You cannot see her now, John,' said Ruth,
coming forward.

1457
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:16,190
'Annie is with her now.'

1458
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:17,920
What does that matter?

1459
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,990
Let me see my dead one, and then die.

1460
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:25,050
All the women moved away from me, crying.

1461
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:28,810
Only Ruth stood by me, and put her little
hand in mine.

1462
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:32,180
'John, she is not your dead one.

1463
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:35,380
She may still be your living one, and your
wife.

1464
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:38,130
But you must not see her now.

1465
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:42,030
The sight of you like this will certainly
kill her.'

1466
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:47,550
I could not understand what she was saying,
but I let them lead me upstairs to my bed.

1467
01:43:47,550 --> 01:43:51,530
The bullet had broken a bone in my chest,
and I was soon in a fever.

1468
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:57,860
It was only much later that I learnt how Ruth
had saved Lorna's life.

1469
01:43:57,860 --> 01:44:01,670
When I had run out of the church, Ruth had
taken control.

1470
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:05,870
She made John Fry and the other men carry
Lorna home immediately.

1471
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:11,440
There, she cut off the wedding dress, pulled
the bullet from Lorna's wound, and stopped

1472
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,050
the bleeding with cold water.

1473
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:20,760
All this time, Lorna lay still and white,
and everyone was sure that she would die.

1474
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:25,980
But Ruth covered the wound with a cloth, kept
her warm, and made her drink a little wine

1475
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:27,750
from a spoon.

1476
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:32,500
And after a while everyone could see that
Lorna was still breathing.

1477
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:38,120
She lay close to death for many days, but
with Ruth's loving care, she slowly began

1478
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:39,420
to get better.

1479
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:46,110
Meanwhile, I lay in my bed, only half-conscious,
and in my fever I did not believe them when

1480
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:49,340
they told me Lorna was still alive.

1481
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:54,800
I knew in my heart that she was dead, and
I had no interest in life - a life without

1482
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:58,640
Lorna was worthless, without meaning.

1483
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:05,830
Mother cried, and thought that I would die,
but after six weeks the fever left me.

1484
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:08,890
I was so weak that I could not leave my room.

1485
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:15,320
Outside, the sun shone on the spring flowers,
but in my misery I cared nothing for the beauty

1486
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:16,540
of the world.

1487
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:20,210
Then, the next morning, Ruth came to see me.

1488
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:21,290
'John!'

1489
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:24,880
she said, 'are you well enough to see your
wife?

1490
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:28,420
I was afraid to bring her before, while you
were so ill.'

1491
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:33,510
'I don't understand,' I said, staring at her.

1492
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:38,030
She went away, then came back, and behind
her was Lorna.

1493
01:45:38,030 --> 01:45:43,820
Ruth closed the door, and ran away; and Lorna
stood before me.

1494
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:45,860
But she did not stand for long.

1495
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:52,210
She ran to me and managed to get into my arms,
although they were too weak to hold her.

1496
01:45:52,210 --> 01:45:57,520
She put her warm young face against mine,
and would not look at me, preferring kissing

1497
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:59,480
to looking.

1498
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:01,660
I felt my life come back to me.

1499
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:04,970
I felt the happiness of living, and of loving.

1500
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:10,790
I felt the sweetness and the sadness of my
Lorna's tears, and the softness of her loving

1501
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:11,790
lips.

1502
01:46:11,790 --> 01:46:16,040
And the world, suddenly, was a good place
again.

1503
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:17,400
I have not much more to tell.

1504
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:23,710
Over the days that followed, Lorna sat beside
me, and we watched each other getting better.

1505
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:26,460
We have never tired of watching each other
since.

1506
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:29,000
Now, we live peacefully on the farm.

1507
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:35,460
Though Lorna still has great riches, we never
use the money, except for some poor neighbour.

1508
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:40,560
I sometimes buy her beautiful clothes, but
she soon gives them away, or keeps them for

1509
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,120
the children.

1510
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:43,780
Tom and Annie are happy.

1511
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:48,980
Except for a few small adventures, Tom remains
on the right side of the law, and they have

1512
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:49,980
honest children.

1513
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,490
Lizzie married the captain of Jeremy Stickles's
soldiers, who had stayed with us when we fought

1514
01:46:54,490 --> 01:46:56,530
the Doones.

1515
01:46:56,530 --> 01:47:01,470
Ruth is not married yet, but there is a man
who loves her, as much as I love Lorna, and

1516
01:47:01,470 --> 01:47:04,310
I'm sure he will win her soon.

1517
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:08,960
But of Lorna herself, my darling wife, I won't
say much.

1518
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:12,340
A man should not talk too much about the best
thing in his life.

1519
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:19,680
Year by year, her beauty and her loving kindness
grow greater; and after all this time, and

1520
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:27,690
all that has happened to us, she is still
my Lorna Doone.

1521
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:37,219
- THE END -
