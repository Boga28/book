1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,760
Mr Hiram B. Otis was a rich 
American from New York.  

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,040
He had come to live and work in England, 
but he did not want to live in London.  

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,160
He did not want to live in the city. He wanted 
to live in the countryside outside London.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,280
Canterville Chase was a large 
and very old house near London.  

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,320
Lord Canterville, the owner, wanted to sell it. 
So Mr Hiram B. Otis visited Lord Canterville.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,320
'I do not live in Canterville Chase,' Lord 
Canterville said to Mr Otis. 'I do not want  

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,040
to live there. The house has a 
ghost - The Canterville Ghost.'

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,680
'I come from America,' said Mr 
Otis. 'America is a modern country.  

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,840
I don't believe in ghosts. Have 
you seen this Canterville Ghost?'

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,960
'No,' said Lord Canterville, 
'but I have heard it at night.'

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,080
'I don't believe in ghosts,' Mr Otis 
said again. 'No one has found a ghost.  

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,040
No one has put a ghost in a museum. And 
you haven't seen this ghost either.'

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,040
'But several members of my family have seen it,' 
said Lord Canterville. 'My aunt saw the ghost.  

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,520
She was so frightened that she 
was ill for the rest of her life.  

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,200
Also, the servants have seen it so they 
will not stay in the house at night.  

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,440
Only the housekeeper, Mrs Umney, lives in 
Canterville Chase. Mrs Umney lives there alone.'

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,760
'I want to buy the house,' said Mr Otis.  

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,640
'I'll buy the ghost as well. Will you sell 
Canterville Chase? Will you sell the ghost?'

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,920
'Yes, I will,' said Lord 
Canterville. 'But, please remember,  

20
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:07,840
I told you about the ghost 
before you bought the house.'

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Mr Hiram B. Otis bought Canterville Chase. 
Then his family came to England from America.  

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,840
He had a wife called Lucretia, 
three sons and a daughter.

23
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,040
The eldest son, Washington, was almost twenty 
years old. He was good-looking and had fair  

24
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,320
hair. His two young brothers were twins. They 
were twelve years old. The daughter, Virginia,  

25
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,360
was fifteen years old. She had 
large blue eyes and a lovely face.

26
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,760
Mr Otis took his family to 
live at Canterville Chase.  

27
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,560
The old house was in the countryside west of 
London. Mr Otis and his family travelled from  

28
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,080
London by train. Then they rode to the 
house in a wagon pulled by two horses.

29
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,720
Canterville Chase was big and old. Trees grew 
all around the house. The Otis family wanted to  

30
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,800
stop and look at the outside of the house, but 
the sky darkened. A thunderstorm was coming.  

31
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,840
Rain started to fall, so the family 
went inside the house quickly.

32
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,680
Mrs Umney, the housekeeper, was waiting for them 
by the front door. She was an old woman and wore  

33
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,840
a black dress and white apron. She lived at 
Canterville Chase and looked after the house.

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,520
'Welcome to Canterville Chase,' said 
Mrs Umney. 'Would you like some tea?'

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,560
'Yes, please,' said Mrs Otis.

36
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,200
The Otis family followed Mrs Umney into the 
library. There was a big table in the centre of  

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,600
the room and many chairs. Mrs Umney put teacups 
on the table, then she brought a pot of tea.

38
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,360
The Otises sat in the library and drank their tea. 
They looked out of a large window at the rain.  

39
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,720
The rain was falling heavily and the sky was 
black. They heard thunder and they saw lightning.

40
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,840
Mrs Otis looked around the room. There were many 
books on bookshelves. There were paintings on  

41
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,480
the walls. There was also a red stain on the 
floor. The red stain was by the fireplace.

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,320
'What is this red stain?' 
Mrs Otis asked Mrs Umney.

43
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,720
'It is blood,' answered the old 
housekeeper in a quiet voice.

44
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
'I don't want a blood-stain in my library,'  

45
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,720
said Mrs Otis. 'Please remove the stain. 
Please clean the floor immediately.'

46
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,120
The old woman smiled. 'It is the 
blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville.  

47
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:55,280
She was murdered by her husband, Sir 
Simon de Canterville, in 1575. The  

48
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,960
blood-stain has been here for over three 
hundred years. It cannot be removed.'

49
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,600
'Nonsense,' said Washington Otis. 'I have 
some Pinkerton's Stain Remover from America.  

50
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,840
It can remove any stain. Watch.'

51
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,520
Washington Otis took the stain remover 
from a bag. Pinkerton's Stain Remover  

52
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,920
looked like a small black stick. He rubbed 
the stick on the blood-stain. A minute later  

53
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,400
the floor was clean. The stick had 
removed the stain quickly and easily.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,160
Mrs Umney looked at the floor. She was 
frightened. No one had removed the blood-stain  

55
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,640
for three hundred years. Mrs 
Umney was very frightened.

56
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,400
'Pinkerton's can remove anything,' said 
Washington Otis. 'The blood-stain has gone.'

57
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,880
Lightning flashed and lit the library. Thunder 
crashed over the house. Mrs Umney fainted.

58
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,440
Mr and Mrs Otis ran across the library. They 
helped the old housekeeper who lay on the floor.  

59
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,760
Mrs Umney's eyes were closed 
and her face was pale.

60
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,200
'Mrs Umney! Mrs Umney!' cried 
Mrs Otis. 'Can you speak?'

61
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,840
Mrs Umney opened her eyes.  

62
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:24,880
'Trouble will come to this house,' she said. 'I 
have seen the ghost. The ghost will come to you.'

63
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,400
All the Otises helped Mrs Umney to stand 
up. 'The ghost will come,' she said again.  

64
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,320
'You must not remove the blood-stain. You must not 
clean the library floor. The ghost will be angry.'

65
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,920
Then Mrs Umney went upstairs to her room.

66
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,120
'Let's look for the ghost,' said the 
Otis boys. 'Let's look round the house.'

67
00:06:50,320 --> 00:07:01,840
The Otises looked round the house together. 
But they did not see the Canterville Ghost.

68
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,200
That night the family went to bed early. 
The storm continued all night. Next  

69
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,080
morning they went into the library. The 
blood-stain had reappeared on the floor.

70
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,640
'I'll remove this blood-stain 
once more,' said Washington Otis.  

71
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,240
'Mother doesn't want a blood-stain in 
the library. I'll clean the floor again.'

72
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,200
He removed the blood-stain 
with Pinkerton's Stain Remover.  

73
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,040
The library floor was clean. But the next 
morning the stain had come back again.

74
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,160
'This is very strange,' said Mr Otis. 
'I'll lock the library door at night.  

75
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,000
No one can come into the library. No 
one can put a stain on the floor.'

76
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,960
'I don't think Pinkerton's Stain Remover is bad,' 
said Washington Otis. 'I think there really is a  

77
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,320
ghost. The ghost is making the blood-stain. The 
ghost puts the stain on the floor at night.'

78
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:11,440
'We must find this ghost,' said Mr Hiram 
B. Otis. 'It must stop making these stains.  

79
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,760
Your mother does not like 
blood on the library floor.'

80
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,880
That day the family went out. They walked 
around the countryside near Canterville Chase.  

81
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,880
They went to the nearby village. They looked 
at the old village houses. Then they walked  

82
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,160
back to Canterville Chase through the woods. It 
was a summer evening and the weather was fine.

83
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,640
It was late when they got back to the house. 
The Otises were hungry and tired. After eating  

84
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,880
supper they went to bed. The bedrooms were 
upstairs. There was a long corridor upstairs.  

85
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,000
The bedroom doors were along this corridor.

86
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,680
Mr Otis woke up after midnight. There 
was a strange noise outside his room.  

87
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,440
The sound was like metal chains. 
The chains were nabbing together.

88
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,760
Mr Otis got out of bed and opened the 
bedroom door. He-looked into the corridor.

89
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:20,640
He saw the Canterville Ghost in the corridor. 
The ghost was an old man with burning red eyes.  

90
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:28,240
He had long grey hair and wore very old-fashioned 
clothes. There were chains on his hands and feet.  

91
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,160
He was rubbing the chains 
together so they made a noise.

92
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,560
'My dear sir, your chains make a terrible noise,'  

93
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,360
Mr Otis said to the ghost. 'You 
must put some oil on those chains.  

94
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,520
Here is some Tammany Rising Sun Oil from the 
United States. Please put the oil on your chains.'

95
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,160
Mr Otis put a bottle of oil 
on a table in the corridor.  

96
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,840
Then he closed his bedroom 
door and went back to bed.

97
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,920
The Canterville Ghost was very surprised. 
He had lived in Canterville Chase for  

98
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,080
three hundred years. Everyone was frightened 
of him, because everyone was afraid of ghosts.  

99
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
But this American gentleman was not afraid.

100
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,960
The Canterville Ghost decided to 
work harder. He wanted to frighten  

101
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:25,040
the American. He made a terrible noise and 
shone a horrible green light in the corridor.

102
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,400
Another door opened at the end of 
the corridor. Mr Otis's youngest  

103
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,240
sons came out of their bedroom. The two young boys 
had the pillows from their beds in their hands.  

104
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,960
They threw the pillows at the 
ghost. They laughed at the ghost.

105
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,600
The ghost was amazed and upset. No one 
had laughed at him before. He was a ghost.  

106
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,720
Everyone is frightened of ghosts. No one had 
ever laughed at the Canterville Ghost before.

107
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,560
The Canterville Ghost did not know what to do.  

108
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,480
He disappeared through the wall 
and the house became quiet.

109
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,000
The ghost went to the secret room where he lived.  

110
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,240
He sat down on a chair. He 
thought about what had happened.

111
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,440
He had frightened people for three hundred years. 
He had looked through windows and frightened the  

112
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,720
servants. He had knocked on bedroom doors. 
He had frightened people in their beds.  

113
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,200
He had blown out candles in the night. He had 
turned green and made noises with his chains.  

114
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,640
Everyone had always been frightened. No one had 
given him Rising Sun Oil to put on his chains.  

115
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:56,320
No one had thrown pillows at 
him. He was a very unhappy ghost.

116
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,480
Washington Otis removed the blood-stain in 
the library every day. Every morning the  

117
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,040
stain had reappeared. But the stain 
was no longer the color of blood.  

118
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,600
One morning it was brown. Another morning 
it was purple. Then it became bright green.

119
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,520
The Otises laughed at the blood-stain. They 
looked for it every morning before breakfast.

120
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,920
'What color is it today?' asked Washington Otis.

121
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,760
'It's green!' shouted the 
twins. 'It's green blood today.'

122
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,920
They laughed at the green 
blood-stain on the library floor.

123
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,840
Virginia Otis did not laugh. The 
young girl was silent at breakfast.  

124
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,920
The blood-stain made her feel sad and she almost 
cried when she saw the bright green stain.  

125
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,520
She was sure that the ghost put the stain 
on the floor. She felt sorry for the ghost.

126
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,720
'The stain has been here for three hundred years,' 
said Virginia. 'We have been here for three weeks.  

127
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,920
The poor ghost puts the stain on the floor 
every night. Can't you leave the stain there?'

128
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,840
But the others did not listen to Virginia.

129
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,760
The second appearance of the ghost was on 
a Sunday night. The Otises had all gone  

130
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:33,840
to bed. Suddenly they were woken up. They 
heard a terrible crashing noise downstairs.

131
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,720
The whole family ran out of their bedrooms. They 
ran downstairs. It was dark but Mr Otis and his  

132
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,880
eldest son carried candles. They heard another 
crashing noise in the hallway near the front door.

133
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,840
There was a suit of armor in the hallway. This  

134
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,680
suit of armor was more than three hundred years 
old. It had fallen over and made a loud noise.  

135
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,080
The Canterville Ghost was sitting 
on the floor next to the armor.

136
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,120
The ghost had tried to put on the suit of armor. 
He wanted to walk around the house and frighten  

137
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,680
the Otis family. But the metal suit was too heavy. 
The suit of armor had fallen onto the floor.

138
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,680
The Canterville Ghost was 
sitting beside the armor.  

139
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,080
He was rubbing his knee. He had hurt himself.

140
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,280
Mr Hiram B. Otis pointed a gun at the ghost.  

141
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Washington Otis held his candle high in 
the air. The Otis twins laughed loudly.  

142
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,320
Virginia was afraid and stood beside her mother. 
They all looked at the Canterville Ghost.

143
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,760
The ghost was very angry. He stood up and gave a 
loud shout. He blew out the candle in Washington  

144
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,440
Otis's hand. There was no light in the hall. 
Then the ghost ran up the stairs in the darkness.

145
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,360
He stopped at the top of the stairs and 
laughed. He had a frightening laugh.  

146
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,920
Men's hair had turned grey when they heard 
him laugh. But the Otises were not afraid.

147
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,640
'Are you in pain?' asked Mrs Otis. 'I 
have a bottle of Dr Dobell's medicine.  

148
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,400
It is good for stomach-aches and 
headaches. Please take the medicine.'

149
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,880
The ghost looked at Mrs Otis angrily. 
Then he disappeared in a green cloud  

150
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:38,000
and went back to his secret room. He was very 
unhappy. He had tried to put on the suit of armor,  

151
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:53,840
but it was too heavy. The armor had fallen 
over and the ghost had hurt his leg.

152
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,480
The ghost stayed in his room during 
the day. He came out at night  

153
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,880
to visit the library. He repainted the 
blood-stain every night. And every morning,  

154
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,360
Washington Otis removed the blood-stain 
with Pinkerton's Stain Remover.

155
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,120
But the ghost had a problem. He had quickly 
finished all his red paint. Now his brown and  

156
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,000
purple paints were finished as well. So, sometimes 
he painted the blood-stain green, sometimes blue.

157
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,680
The ghost made plans. He wanted to frighten 
the Otis twins. He planned to visit the  

158
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:41,040
twins in the night. He planned to turn himself 
green and make a horrible noise. He planned to  

159
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,880
visit the twins in their bedroom. He planned to 
touch them with his ice-cold hands in the dark.

160
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,840
He left his secret room at 
midnight. The house was dark.

161
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,280
He climbed the stairs and walked along 
the corridor. The twins' bedroom was  

162
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,840
at the end of the corridor round a corner. 
He turned the corner. Suddenly he stopped.

163
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,440
In front of him was a round face with 
a terrible mouth and burning eyes. Fire  

164
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,720
shone out of the mouth and eyes of this 
horrible face. It was the face of a ghost!

165
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,480
The Canterville Ghost gave a shout and ran back to  

166
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,440
his secret room. He had never seen a 
ghost before and felt very frightened.

167
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Before daylight came, the 
Canterville Ghost felt better.  

168
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,240
Were there two ghosts in the house? He must 
find out. He must meet the second ghost.

169
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,600
He went back upstairs and walked along 
the corridor towards the twins' room.  

170
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,720
The second ghost was still there, 
but its eyes were no longer burning.  

171
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,280
He went up to it. He touched it. The head 
of the second ghost fell onto the floor.  

172
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,800
It was not a ghost at all. It was a head made 
from a large round vegetable called a pumpkin.  

173
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,760
The twins had put a candle inside 
it. There was a card on the floor.

174
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,840
THE OTIS GHOST THE ONLY TRUE CANTERVILLE GHOST

175
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,720
The twins had put the head in the corridor to 
frighten him. This made the Canterville Ghost very  

176
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:27,840
angry. What could he do? He could think of nothing 
at that moment, so he went back to his room.

177
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,000
The ghost felt very weak and tired. 
He stayed in his room for five days.  

178
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,080
He did not repaint the blood-stain in 
the library. There had been a blood-stain  

179
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,840
on the library floor for three hundred 
years. Now the library floor was clean.

180
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,760
After a week the ghost felt better. He decided 
to try once more to frighten the Otis twins.  

181
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,320
He planned to make his face look as horrible as 
possible. He waited until the middle of the night.

182
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,880
Slowly and silently he walked to the 
twins' bedroom. It was one o'clock  

183
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,720
in the morning. The house was quiet. The 
door of the twins' room was slightly open.

184
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,280
The ghost took off his head 
and carried it under his arm.  

185
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,720
It is terrifying to see a headless 
ghost. He wanted to terrify the twins.

186
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,000
He pushed open the door of the twins' 
bedroom. The door banged against the wall.

187
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,520
He had planned to shout and 
hold his head in his hinds.  

188
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,440
But a heavy jug of water fell 
from the top of the door.

189
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:55,280
The twins had played a trick on him. He was 
soaked with water. The twins shouted and laughed.

190
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,160
The ghost ran back down the corridor. He could not  

191
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,080
frighten the twins. He could not 
frighten anyone in the Otis family.

192
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,640
Washington Otis came out of his bedroom.  

193
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,040
The ghost stopped running. Behind 
him, the twins ran down the corridor.  

194
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,840
They shouted - 'Boo!' - in his ears and waved 
their arms. Washington Otis laughed at him.

195
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,160
The ghost did not know what to do. He 
ran through the nearest door, went back  

196
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:34,320
to the secret room and lay down. He could not 
frighten anyone. He was a very unhappy ghost.

197
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,640
The Otises did not see the 
Canterville ghost at night again.  

198
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,480
The twins waited for him when it was 
dark. They put a rope across the corridor.  

199
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,160
They tied metal tins to the rope. But 
the ghost did not walk into the tins.  

200
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,280
Only Mr Otis came along the corridor. He 
fell over the rope and was very angry.

201
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:16,240
Virginia Otis was also angry with the twins. 
'Can't you leave the poor ghost alone?' she said.  

202
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,080
'Why do you want to hurt him? Why 
do you want to play tricks on him?  

203
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,560
He has lived here for a very 
long time. Leave him alone.'

204
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:32,160
The twins did not listen, but the ghost heard 
Virginia's words. The words gave him hope.

205
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,000
One afternoon, Virginia went to the library.  

206
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:43,920
The library door was slightly open. She pushed the 
door wide open and quietly walked into the room.

207
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,160
There was somebody sitting by the 
window. It was the Canterville Ghost!

208
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,280
He was looking at the library window  

209
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,920
which was made of colored glass. 
There were words painted on the glass.

210
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,960
He was wearing his best clothes 
and had combed his long grey hair.

211
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,400
'I feel very sorry for 
you,' said Virginia quietly.  

212
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,560
'I'm sorry that my brothers were not very kind 
to you. But you did try to frighten them.'

213
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:22,960
'Yes I did,' said the ghost. 'It is my job to 
frighten everyone who comes to Canterville Chase.'

214
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,360
'You are very wicked, I know,' said Virginia,  

215
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,520
'Mrs Umney, the housekeeper, told 
us that you killed your wife.'

216
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,760
'Yes I did,' replied the ghost.  

217
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,200
'But she wasn't very kind. And it wasn't very 
kind of her brothers to starve me to death.'

218
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,680
'Starve you to death?' said Virginia. 'Oh, poor 
ghost, are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?'

219
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,840
'No thank you,' he replied. 'I never 
eat anything. But you are very kind.  

220
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:08,320
You are much kinder than the rest of your 
family. They are rude, nasty and unkind.'

221
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,720
'Stop!' cried Virginia. 'You 
are nasty and unkind too.  

222
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,040
You stole my paint box. You used my paints 
to make the blood-stain in the library.  

223
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,840
I never told anyone about it. But 
now I'm going to fetch my father.'

224
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,520
She turned to go, but the ghost spoke again.

225
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:35,360
'Please do not go, Miss Virginia,' 
said the ghost. 'I am so lonely  

226
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:43,680
and so unhappy. I do not know what to 
do. I want to go to sleep and I cannot.'

227
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,840
'It's easy to sleep,' said Virginia. 
'You go to bed and close your eyes.'

228
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,560
'I have not slept for three hundred years,'  

229
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,960
said the ghost. 'I have not slept since 
I was murdered by my wife's brothers.'

230
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,880
Virginia walked across the library and looked 
at the old face of the ghost. It was a sad face.

231
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,320
'Poor ghost,' said Virginia, 
'how can I help you to sleep?'

232
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,880
'Far away in the woods,' said the 
ghost, 'there is a little garden.  

233
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:30,800
In the little garden the grass grows long 
and thick. There are many flowers and trees.  

234
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:39,040
A nightingale sings all night long. 
The bird's sweet song is beautiful  

235
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:49,040
and sad. The white stars and the pale moon look 
down on this little garden. It is very peaceful.'

236
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,960
Virginia's eyes were full of tears. 
She put her hands over her face.

237
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,800
'You mean it is the Garden 
of Death,' she said quietly.

238
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,800
'Yes, the Garden of Sleep,' said the ghost.  

239
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:14,000
'It is very beautiful. There is peace 
and silence. There is no yesterday  

240
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:23,280
and no tomorrow. But only Love can open the door 
to the garden. For Love is stronger than Death.'

241
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,760
Virginia did not know what to say. 
She listened as the ghost spoke again.

242
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,640
'Have you read the writing on the library window?'

243
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,840
'Yes,' said Virginia, 'but 
I do not understand it.'

244
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,600
'Look,' said the ghost. 'Read 
the lines on the window.'

245
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,400
Virginia looked at the window 
and read the lines of poetry:
 
 

246
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,920
When a golden girl shall weep

247
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,720
For the ghost that cannot sleep,

248
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,160
Then the dead at last shall die

249
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,280
And in restful earth may lie.
 
 

250
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,640
'The words mean you must weep for me,'  

251
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,640
said the unhappy ghost. 'Then the 
Angel of Death will let me rest.

252
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,320
Will you help?'

253
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,000
'What do I have to do?' asked Virginia.

254
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:28,560
'You must come with me into the darkness. 
You will see strange things. You will hear  

255
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:38,160
strange voices, but nothing will hurt you. You 
are good and kind. The dark cannot hurt you.'

256
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,520
Virginia did not answer and the ghost waited. 
He had waited for three hundred years.  

257
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,520
This was the longest minute of all that time.

258
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,160
'I am not afraid,' said Virginia at last. 
'I will come with you into the dark.'

259
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,400
The ghost kissed her hand. His lips were 
cold like ice, but they burned like fire.  

260
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,280
The ghost held her hand and they 
walked to the wall of the library.  

261
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,560
The wall opened. There was 
darkness beyond the wall  

262
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:25,920
and a cold wind. Voices spoke out of the wind. 'Go 
back, Virginia. Go back before it is too late.'

263
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,480
Virginia walked into the darkness with the ghost.  

264
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,200
Virginia and the ghost disappeared 
through the library wall.

265
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,200
Virginia did not come downstairs for supper. 
Mr Otis sent one of the servants to her room.  

266
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,400
The servant could not find Virginia so everybody 
searched the house. They looked everywhere  

267
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,880
but they could not find her. Mr 
and Mrs Otis were very worried.

268
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,520
It was a summer evening and the sun had 
not set, so the family and the servants  

269
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:16,720
searched the gardens before it was dark. In the 
garden there were many trees and a deep pond.  

270
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,760
They looked in the pond. They looked in the trees. 
Then they asked people at the railway station. But  

271
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:30,720
no one had seen Virginia. Mr Otis went to tell the 
village policeman that Virginia had disappeared.  

272
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,480
But, by that time, it was dark and no 
one could search any more that night.

273
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:45,360
None of the family wanted to eat or sleep. 
They sat in the library and waited. They hoped  

274
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,280
Virginia would return safely. They planned 
to search for Virginia again in the morning.

275
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,840
It was midnight when the family decided to 
go to bed. They left the library and started  

276
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,720
to walk up the stairs together. Suddenly all 
the clocks in the house struck twelve and they  

277
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:17,040
heard a terrible noise. Thunder crashed outside 
the house and the Otises heard a dreadful cry.  

278
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,360
Strange music sounded inside the house and 
a door opened at the top of the stairs.

279
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,880
Virginia stood in the doorway. She 
looked down the stairs at them.  

280
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,400
Her face was very pale and she 
carried a small box in her hand.

281
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,920
'Where have you been?' Mr Otis asked 
angrily. 'Your mother has been very worried.  

282
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,840
You have frightened us all. You must 
never play a trick like this again.'

283
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,840
'Except on the ghost,' said the twins. 
'You can play tricks on the ghost!'

284
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:06,240
'Father,' Virginia said quietly, 'I 
have been with the ghost. He is dead  

285
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,680
and now he can rest. He gave me this 
box of beautiful jewels before he died.'

286
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,640
She showed her father the small box. 
Inside was a necklace made of red stones.

287
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,000
'Where did you get this?' asked 
her father. 'Where have you been?'

288
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,640
Mr Otis forgot to be angry. He was so 
pleased to see that Virginia was safe.

289
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,480
'Come. I'll show you,' said Virginia.

290
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,920
She turned back to the door 
at the top of the stairs.  

291
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,600
All of the family followed her. 
Washington Otis carried a lighted candle.

292
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:54,000
Virginia led them along a secret corridor. They 
came to an old wooden door which was open. Beyond  

293
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,880
the door was a little room with a low ceiling. 
There was an iron ring in the wall and two chains.  

294
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,640
At the end of the chains was a body. 
Only bones remained. It was a skeleton.

295
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:17,840
'This is the body of Sir Simon de Canterville,' 
said Virginia. 'He murdered his wife in 1575.  

296
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,360
Then his wife's brothers shut him in this 
room. He was given no food. Sir Simon  

297
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:33,120
starved to death. His ghost was in this house for 
three hundred years. But now he has found peace.'

298
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,960
The Otis family looked around the little room  

299
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:45,840
and did not know what to say. Virginia knelt on 
the floor beside the skeleton and began to pray.

300
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,160
There was a funeral four nights later. The Otises  

301
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,560
buried the body of Sir Simon de 
Canterville in a grave among the trees.

302
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:14,160
The Otises, Mrs Umney the housekeeper, and all 
the servants from Canterville Chase stood near  

303
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:21,280
the grave. Behind them were people from the nearby 
village. Many people had come to the funeral.

304
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,240
Virginia carried white flowers. She 
looked up at the stars and the pale moon  

305
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,000
and the dark trees. She remembered what the 
ghost had said about the Garden of Death.  

306
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:43,680
A nightingale began to sing. The bird's 
sweet song was beautiful and sad.

307
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:52,000
Virginia smiled. 'God has forgiven 
him for murdering his wife,' she said.

308
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,042
Hughie thanked him and looked at the envelope. 
These words were written on the envelope:  

309
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:59,267
A wedding present to Hugh Erskine 
and Laura Merton, from an old beggar.

310
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:01,493
Inside was a check for ten thousand pounds.
 
 
 
 

311
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:02,000
- THE END -
