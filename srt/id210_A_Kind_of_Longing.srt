1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,630
Riding a motorbike is a great way to travel.

2
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,860
Who cares if the bike is an old Norton or
a shiny new Suzuki?

3
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:27,090
It's the speed, the noise of the wind in your
ears, the engine roaring under you, burning

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,590
up the miles.

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,540
Bikers are free, alone, they go where they
want...

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:41,780
Free, alone - sometimes lonely.

7
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,640
And danger waits at every bend in the road.

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:01:02,239
But for Roy, riding home to Auckland as night
falls, it's still a great feeling...

9
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:15,369
Coming up from the river towards the road,
Roy looked at his watch.

10
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:19,670
It was half past four.

11
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:28,130
It was cooler now; he could do an hour or
two of the journey before dark.'

12
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,299
He started off down the road, feeling the
heavy fish in the bag against his leg as he

13
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,729
walked.

14
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:43,969
He played the fish again in his mind, feeling
it pull on the line, fighting him all the

15
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,039
way.

16
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:49,180
He walked happily through the afternoon stillness.

17
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:57,759
A car was parked off the road by the bridge,
with three men standing beside it.

18
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,609
They watched him coming.

19
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:06,829
They stood drinking from metal cups, looking
pleased with themselves, pleased with the

20
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:10,390
wild boar they had shot.

21
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:16,260
It was tied to the roof of their old American
car.

22
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,720
They looked at Roy and his fish as he came
by.

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,400
'Good fishing, then,' one of them said.

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,570
'Sure,' Roy said.

25
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:33,270
'It looks like everybody's got what they came
for.'

26
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:41,310
He stepped into the long grass, found his
old Norton, and pushed it up to the road.

27
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,170
He felt the men watching him.

28
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,330
'Have a beer,' one of them offered.

29
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,840
'Well, thanks,' Roy said.

30
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,580
He took a cup from one of the bags on his
bike and went over to the car.

31
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:09,560
'That's a nice fish,' the man said, filling
his cup with beer.

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,210
'Not bad,' Roy said.

33
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:20,810
'He nearly took the fly last night, and I
went back to get him today.'

34
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,210
He drank his beer.

35
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:28,980
'He must have a poor memory then,' the man
said.

36
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:37,020
'He just loves Black Gnats,' Roy said, touching
the fishing fly pinned to his shirt.

37
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,490
They all looked.

38
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,970
You could tell that they were not fishermen.

39
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,580
Roy looked at the dead boar with its long
dangerous teeth.

40
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:57,370
'Big one,' he said, and finished the beer.

41
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,500
The guy offered the bottle.

42
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,110
'No, thanks.

43
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:05,180
I've got to get going.'

44
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,430
He walked back to the bike and went on packing.

45
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,430
The men stood around with their beer, watching
him.

46
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:21,829
Roy picked up the fish and held it up to show
them how big it was, and they smiled.

47
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,680
He packed it away in one of the bags.

48
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,580
He sat down on the grass and pulled on his
boots, thinking that it hadn't been a bad

49
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,020
weekend.

50
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,639
He felt the men watching him.

51
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,499
They were friendly, but there was something
about it, a kind of feeling he wasn't sure

52
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:45,860
about.

53
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,550
He put on his crash helmet and his gloves.

54
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,850
Then he started the bike and waved goodbye.

55
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:59,389
The men smiled, and one of them lifted his
beer for good luck.

56
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:04,120
'I'm on my own,' Roy thought.

57
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,460
'That's what it is.

58
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:14,810
They're three friends out together in the
afternoon, and I'm on my own, with two hundred

59
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,240
miles to go.

60
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,580
It's a small thing, but that's what it is,
all right.'

61
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:30,419
He turned away and rode the Norton down the
road.

62
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:36,330
The road stayed near the river for the next
eight or ten miles.

63
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,740
Sometimes the rocky walls of the valley hid
the river, and sometimes you could see it

64
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,370
far below you.

65
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:52,509
In places, road and river went side by side,
and you could see the wet rocks shining in

66
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:59,330
the late afternoon sun, and the deep black
water at the bends.

67
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,860
It was always good to be close to a river,
Roy thought.

68
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,139
Next time he would fish down river from the
bridge.

69
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:19,240
The road turned away from the river at last,
and joined the highway.

70
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,000
Roy let the bike go faster.

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,389
He felt the old feeling coming as the miles
went by.

72
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:34,469
All the things that hurt disappeared, all
the things that didn't matter.

73
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:42,020
He didn't need to think, not about being alone,
not about anything.

74
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:48,169
He did sixty-five miles in the first hour.

75
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:53,199
He felt calm and easy.

76
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,800
Sometimes it worried him, riding fast, but
this afternoon was fine.

77
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,029
When it was dark, he would slow down.

78
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:09,669
He rode on past the rich farmland.

79
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:17,539
He thought about the farmers, finishing work,
perhaps having their tea.

80
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:21,349
That made him feel a little hungry.

81
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:28,620
Maybe about halfway he would stop for a cup
of coffee and something to eat.

82
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:35,620
He came round a bend and saw a car just disappearing
round the next bend.

83
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,810
He slowed down a little, waiting for a place
to pass it.

84
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:48,900
It was a big, old car, and as he came up behind
it, the driver speeded up and went fast into

85
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,240
the next bend.

86
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,449
Roy stayed behind him, waiting for a straight
piece of road.

87
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:01,169
Maybe the guy just didn't like bikes.

88
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:08,699
The place came at last, half a mile of straight
empty road, going up a small hill.

89
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,710
He checked his mirror, and passed the car.

90
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:21,039
He went up the hill, leaving the car behind,
and he was alone again on a straight road.

91
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,559
And then the world exploded underneath him!

92
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:33,250
It came with a sudden crash, like a shot from
a gun behind him.

93
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:40,880
A moment later, he realized what it was - he
was riding a flying machine on a back tyre

94
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,130
in pieces, fighting wildly to stay on and
to slow the Norton down from sixty-five to

95
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,660
zero.

96
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:57,220
The big bike flew from one side of the road
to the other, but as it went up the hill,

97
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,430
it began to go slower.

98
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:09,839
Then a car was coming and he was off the road,
and at last, the bike ran hard against a bank

99
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,279
and stopped.

100
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,770
Roy turned off the engine and sat back.

101
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,889
Then the car he had passed came up and stopped
beside him.

102
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:27,380
An unpleasant face stared at him from the
front passenger seat.

103
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,760
'Bad luck!'

104
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,070
The voice sounded pleased.

105
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,089
Somebody laughed.

106
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:41,470
Then the old car roared away and disappeared
over the hill.

107
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,769
Roy got off the bike.

108
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:47,190
He was shaking just a little.

109
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,880
He decided not to think about the guys in
the car for a while.

110
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,320
He wanted to calm down first.

111
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:04,290
He looked down the road, half a mile of it,
straight with no ditch, and he felt how lucky

112
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:12,180
he had been: A long straight road and no ditch,
man.

113
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,500
He turned and looked up the road.

114
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,490
There was a house near the top of the hill.

115
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,880
He half walked, half rode the bike to the
farm gate.

116
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,540
They would let him leave his bike there, surely.

117
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,829
He stopped by the back door and turned off
the engine.

118
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:42,550
A big man in jeans, with only socks on his
feet, came to the door.

119
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:50,620
Roy felt the farmer looking at him, deciding
about him while he explained.

120
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,150
'On your own?'

121
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,230
'Yes.'

122
00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:02,110
Just a minute, the farmer said, and got his
boots.

123
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:08,990
They put the bike in one of the farm buildings,
and Roy felt better about it.

124
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,230
'Lucky it happened there,' the farmer said.

125
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,519
That's true, said Roy.

126
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,850
'And lucky it was the back wheel.'

127
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:22,889
'I used to have one of these things,' the
farmer said, and he reached over to hold the

128
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,940
bike.

129
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,740
He seemed to be looking back in time.

130
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,870
'It'll be safe here,' he said.

131
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,970
Roy took out the fish and gave it to him.

132
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,990
Well, he's a big one!' said farmer.

133
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,829
'We'll keep him for you.'

134
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,240
No, Roy said.

135
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,240
'Give him to the cook.

136
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,540
Do you think I'll get a ride this time of
day?'

137
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,399
Easy, the farmer said.

138
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:26,850
'One of those cattle trucks is what you need
- take you all the way to Westfield.'

139
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:35,139
The first two or three cars did not matter.

140
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:40,560
But then he knew he had a long walk in front
of him.

141
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,290
Most people did not even slow down before
they decided not to take him.

142
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:53,870
He was halfway up the second long hill, and
it was quite dark, when he heard the first

143
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,170
cattle truck.

144
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,790
He waited as the big truck came closer.

145
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:08,980
Then he saw the driver's face looking at him,
and he remembered it when the truck had gone.

146
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:17,190
It wasn't unfriendly, he thought - the guy
just didn't care.

147
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,610
He watched the truck go slowly up the hill.

148
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,820
He started to walk again.

149
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,959
He felt a kind of loneliness walking in the
dark.

150
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:34,879
It was the way the truck driver had looked
at him.

151
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,100
The guy just didn't care.

152
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:44,200
Or maybe he didn't want a stranger with him
all that way.

153
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,079
Maybe he just didn't want to talk.

154
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:54,480
More cars passed, but he didn't even try asking
for a ride any more.

155
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:04,779
He walked on, not caring, knowing how alone
in the world he was.

156
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:11,310
He had walked perhaps another five miles when
he heard his favourite sound.

157
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:18,000
A bike came up fast behind him, and went round
the next corner.

158
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,060
Roy heard it slow down, turn and come back.

159
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,690
The rider stopped and waited for Roy.

160
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:35,149
It was a big modern bike, Japanese, he guessed.

161
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:41,250
The rider sat looking back at him, crash helmet
shining.

162
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:49,560
Roy was next to the bike before he realized
that the rider was a girl - a tall, leggy

163
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:57,870
girl in jeans and boots, and perhaps there
was fair hair under the helmet.

164
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,930
Roy stared as they spoke.

165
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,410
'Which way you going, mister?'

166
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,410
'Auckland.'

167
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,509
'That makes two of us.

168
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:11,110
You have a crash?'

169
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,550
'Tyre went.'

170
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,990
'No fun.'

171
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,829
Roy felt her eyes watching him as she spoke.

172
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:25,389
'Well,' said, talking about it won't get us
home.'

173
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:28,920
Sure, said Roy.

174
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,529
His ears were getting hot under his crash
helmet.

175
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:37,420
He climbed up behind her and they were off.

176
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,999
She rode fast from the beginning.

177
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:44,850
This was a real bike and a real rider.

178
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:51,410
Roy felt good about it - good to be on wheels
again, good that somebody cared enough to

179
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,920
stop.

180
00:15:52,920 --> 00:16:02,080
Close to his face the girl asked, 'What kind
of bike, mister?'

181
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,100
'Norton.

182
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,130
500cc.'

183
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,839
'Front wheel or back?'

184
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:07,850
'Back.'

185
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,880
Not so bad, she said.

186
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,319
'Better bade than front, any day.'

187
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:16,680
'Sure,' Roy said.

188
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:23,709
He wanted to talk to this girl, but he could
not get the words out.

189
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,649
They rode on in silence in the dark.

190
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:29,959
She knew about bikes all right.

191
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,550
'With a guy it's easy,' Roy thought.

192
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:41,120
'You have a crash, you get a ride, you climb
on the bike.

193
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,959
You don't even notice that he can ride it
well.

194
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:53,290
But this is a girl and she knows what she
is doing.

195
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:58,930
That doesn't mean you can't talk to her,'
he told himself.

196
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,230
'You've seen girls before, man.'

197
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:08,459
Her voice came back to him: 'Where have you
come from, mister?'

198
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,620
'Pukatea Valley.'

199
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,699
'Yes?

200
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,949
How was the fishing?'

201
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:21,380
Not bad, Roy said, before he had time to wonder
at her question.

202
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,980
'Nice water by the old bridge.

203
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,449
What were they taking?'

204
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:33,330
Black Gnat, he said, and there was more than
wonder.

205
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,590
He felt that hot pain behind his eyes.

206
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,850
'Wet or dry?'

207
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:47,520
'Wet,' said Roy, and his voice shook a little
with the wonder of it.

208
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,570
And in his heart he felt an ache that came
from a kind of longing.

209
00:17:54,570 --> 00:18:03,130
This was the girl he had been longing for
all his life - a tall, leggy girl who rode

210
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:11,190
a 750cc Suzuki and knew about fly-fishing.

211
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,630
For a while, they rode and did not speak.

212
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:22,970
Then, back on straight road, the girl said,
close to his face, 'My brother caught a six-pound

213
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,779
fish under that bridge one year.'

214
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:29,240
'Really!'

215
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,300
Roy was beginning to understand.

216
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,460
'How long ago was that?'

217
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,720
'Maybe five years ago.

218
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,529
Ross played him for half an hour before he
pulled him in.'

219
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:48,710
'Sounds like he's a good fisherman, your brother,'
Roy said.

220
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:55,070
'He was,' she said, and that was all.

221
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:01,460
And Roy, guessing what she meant, knew it
was not the kind of thing you could shout

222
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,799
about above the noise of the wind and the
engine.

223
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:14,700
After a few miles the girl said, 'My name's
Kay, mister.'

224
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,480
Roy said his own name.

225
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,200
It sounded strange to him.

226
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:27,180
'Well, Roy, you going to buy me a cup of coffee
when we get to the next town?'

227
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,320
'Sure,' Roy said.

228
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,450
'Sure thing, Kay.'

229
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,520
They dropped their speed and rode into the
town.

230
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,260
It was quiet on a Sunday evening.

231
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,660
They found the place they wanted, and got
off the bike.

232
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:51,510
Her hair was long and fair and blown about
by the wind.

233
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:58,500
In the coffee shop he saw her face for the
first time, and he felt that kind of longing

234
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:05,500
from way back, and he sat down beside her,
knowing what it was.

235
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,150
'How long were you walking back there?'

236
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:16,740
Her voice was soft and pleasant after the
shouted conversation on the road.

237
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,559
'Perhaps five or six miles,' Roy said.

238
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,399
'Nobody was interested.'

239
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:26,659
'They never are.'

240
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:32,770
'It's not the kind of thing you worry about,'
he said.

241
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,050
'No.'

242
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:42,770
They sat drinking their coffee, watching and
listening, getting the idea of each other.

243
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,830
'You go fishing a lot?'

244
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,270
she said.

245
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,540
'Sure.

246
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,809
Fishing.

247
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:49,809
Moving around.'

248
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:54,010
'Always travel alone?'

249
00:20:54,010 --> 00:21:00,900
'My friend got killed,' Roy said.

250
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,529
It came out like that.

251
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:09,660
There was not much else that he could say.

252
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:15,860
He felt a kind of softness in her eyes that
took him by the heart.

253
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,880
'What about you?' he said.

254
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,710
'What about me?'

255
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:29,919
'I mean, you can tell me about your brother.'

256
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:40,870
He saw her eyes - their softness, the quiet
hurt as his words hit her.

257
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,760
'Ross got killed in the army,' she said.

258
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:51,230
'It was his first week - just a stupid accident.

259
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,580
He was only twenty.

260
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,820
He fell off the back of a truck and hit his
head.

261
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:05,620
He used to do wild, crazy things all the time
- but then what killed him was just a stupid

262
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,679
accident...'

263
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:11,870
He played with his spoon in the coffee.

264
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,789
'What about your friend?'

265
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:19,480
she asked after a while.

266
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,010
'Plane,' Roy said.

267
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,330
'Another thing that just couldn't happen.'

268
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:33,940
He saw it in his mind - the broken plane,
that moment he could never forget for the

269
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,390
rest of his life.

270
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:46,490
This was something they both knew, he and
this girl: a death that you couldn't believe.

271
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:55,250
And that feeling was always with you, everywhere,
like a voice that whispers in your ear, 'There

272
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:03,799
will never be enough road any more, enough
water, enough air...'

273
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:10,790
But beyond the feelings of hurt, old and new,
he knew that they were telling each other

274
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:17,120
the truth about themselves, not hiding things.

275
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,919
Was he choosing the right words?

276
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,800
It didn't matter.

277
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:31,330
Now he asked, 'Where've you been today then,
on your big bike?'

278
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,890
'Tauranga.'

279
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,919
'Stay the weekend?'

280
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:38,110
'Down this morning.

281
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,320
It's only two hundred and sixty miles there
and back,' she said.

282
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,840
'My father's in a kind of hospital down there.

283
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,950
I don't stay because one visit each time is
all I can do.'

284
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,620
'I'm sorry,' Roy said.

285
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,810
It was all in her eyes.

286
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:11,880
In his mind, Roy saw a strong man broken - the
father who would never get old, never die.

287
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,179
How could you believe it, live with it?

288
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:22,770
Maybe he taught them to fish, Roy thought,
this girl and her brother, dead at twenty

289
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,659
from his accident.

290
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:33,710
Maybe he taught them all those good things
and they all had fun together, and then suddenly

291
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:41,140
she looked around and she was the only one
left.

292
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,750
Maybe that's why she rides the big bike.

293
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,019
The time was starting to get heavy now.

294
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,159
'What do you say we get on the road?'

295
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,240
Kay said.

296
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,080
'Sure.'

297
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,169
They went out and Roy felt the heaviness going.

298
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:07,789
It was all right if you knew when to get up
and go.

299
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:14,049
They put on their crash helmets and the tall
leggy girl started her bike.

300
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:21,230
Roy climbed on behind her, and they went away
laughing.

301
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:27,490
They rode gently out of the sleepy town; then
they reached the highway and the bike roared

302
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,220
away into the night.

303
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,059
Roy felt all right about riding on the back.

304
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:42,019
Sometimes, if you weren't sure about the rider,
you weren't happy when he went fast, but this

305
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,840
girl was okay.

306
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:53,659
They rode, not talking, enjoying the night
ride on their big fast machine.

307
00:25:53,659 --> 00:26:00,059
Roy thought about the things they were passing
- the cattle in the fields, the night sounds

308
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,340
of the farms.

309
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:11,960
Lights appeared and cars sped past, and he
thought about all the people going places.

310
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:19,080
He felt Kay close to him, with her long friendly
shoulders and her fair hair flying back from

311
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,370
under her helmet.

312
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:27,340
He could go on and on.

313
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:33,179
He didn't care about the people who hated
you before they saw you, or enjoyed watching

314
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:41,130
you in trouble on the road, or let you walk
because they didn't want to think about you.

315
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:50,490
He felt that none of it could touch him now,
or ever, that all the hurt had gone, and the

316
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:58,780
shock from the deaths of friends and the bad
feelings that came from people's unkind words.

317
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:08,070
A notice warned of bends in the road, and
Kay cut their speed, and they rode the big

318
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,350
bike down into the first bend.

319
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,890
Cars came up from down below, their lights
showing the narrow road and the banks on each

320
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,190
side.

321
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:25,480
Most of the cars seemed to be in too much
of a hurry, Roy thought.

322
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,340
They reached the bottom of the narrow valley,
where he knew the river ran close to the road.

323
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:36,610
He thought about that clear mountain water
among the trees.

324
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,940
Then they started to climb.

325
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,860
They rode up the hill and into the first bend.

326
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:53,080
And death came down to meet them on the wrong
side of the road.

327
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,690
The lights of the car were right in front
of them.

328
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:01,630
They had nowhere to go, and not enough time
to hate the guy who was killing them.

329
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,600
Roy put his arms round Kay.

330
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,850
He felt his face against her shoulder, their
helmets close together.

331
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:16,139
Then they were off the road and into the ditch
as the car went past, moving too late to its

332
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:17,570
own side of the road.

333
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:24,389
They went on and on, fighting the ditch, crashing
into the bank, and then they were over the

334
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:30,580
bank and sailing, a moment's space before
the hurt that was coming.

335
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:38,860
They crashed down the bank, and Roy held tight
to Kay, and they were off the bike and dying

336
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,210
together, and the ground came up to knock
the life out of his body, and he reached for

337
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,090
Kay as he fell.

338
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:57,980
Impossibly, he was still alive, but as he
fell, crashed, broke, he didn't care - he

339
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:04,970
only reached for Kay, longed for her.

340
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:14,000
He came to rest; there was a taste of blood
and a whisper of pain through the shock, and

341
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,850
he felt cold water around him.

342
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:24,700
He lay in the icy water of the ditch, and
knew he was still alive.

343
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:30,190
Then he was moving along the ditch on hands
and knees, searching for Kay through the pain

344
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,740
and shock.

345
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,870
He pulled himself along the ditch until he
found her.

346
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:41,160
She was lying face down.

347
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:48,380
He touched her, and turned her over as gently
as he could.

348
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,779
Time had stopped.

349
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:58,220
It was like a bad dream, made of all the deaths
that had gone before.

350
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:05,980
He said her name, and it came thick and strange
through his painful lips.

351
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:13,830
She looked at him and he waited for an impossible
moment, and then she began to cry as the shock

352
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:19,820
hit her, and that was all the hope he needed.

353
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:25,580
He took off her helmet, and gently pushed
her hair back, and somewhere above them, he

354
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,490
heard voices and a crashing sound as help
came.

355
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,529
The pain in his legs began to come alive.

356
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:41,160
He put his arm around Kay, loving the life
that returned as she cried life and pain coming

357
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,510
together.

358
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,460
And that was all the hope he needed.

359
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,370
He guessed it must be all the hope in the
world.

360
00:30:51,370 --> 00:31:06,570
Because, for all the time that it lasted,
they would have it together.

361
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:25,009
- THE END -
