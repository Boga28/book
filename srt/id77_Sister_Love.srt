1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:12,340
Marcia met Howard Collins at church. Marcia
was thirty-five years old, Howard was forty-one.

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:24,260
Howard lived with his mother in a small house
on the south side of the town. Marcia lived

3
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,740
with her sister and father in an apartment,
three streets away.

4
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:42,440
Marcia did not work. Her father, George Grant,
was ill and never left the apartment. He stayed

5
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:53,149
in bed most of the time and always needed
somebody with him. So Marcia stayed at home

6
00:00:53,149 --> 00:01:03,240
with her father, and only went out when her
sister Karin was in the house.

7
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:14,520
The two sisters were very different. Marcia
was short with a small round face and short

8
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:29,570
black hair. Karin was ten years younger. She
was tall, had long brown hair, and good legs,

9
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:38,640
and a suntan all through the summer. People
often said to Marcia, 'Your sister is very

10
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:49,080
beautiful.' There were always lots of men
ready to take Karin out to dinner or to the

11
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,310
cinema. But Marcia stayed at home.

12
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:04,701
Karin worked in a shop in the town. When she
was at home, she liked to sit up on the roof

13
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:08,259
garden of their apartment building.

14
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:19,590
It was one Sunday in May when Marcia came
home with Howard the first time. She took

15
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:32,700
him to see her father. George Grant was in
bed. He had grey hair and a grey face. Sometimes

16
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:40,860
he read a book, but mostly he just sat in
bed and watched television.

17
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:54,180
'This is Howard, father,' Marcia said. 'He
works at the hospital, and we met at church.

18
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,120
I told you about him last week. Do you remember?'

19
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:14,209
'No,' her father said. And he turned his face
away, back to his television. He was not interested

20
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:19,470
in new people or his daughters' friends.

21
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:30,170
Just then, Karin came into the room. She wore
a white bikini and white shoes. She smiled

22
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,620
at Howard.

23
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:42,849
'So you're Howard,' she said. 'My big sister
has got a boyfriend at last!'

24
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:48,080
Howard's face went red and he looked down
at his feet.

25
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:57,939
Karin laughed. 'Come on up to the roof garden
and have some wine. The sun is wonderful this

26
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,480
morning.'

27
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,159
'Oh, I...' Howard began.

28
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:16,739
Marcia looked angrily at her sister. But then
she said, 'Yes, I must get father a drink.

29
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:23,190
See you in a minute, Howard. Go up to the
roof and talk to Karin.'

30
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:35,449
The sun was hot on the roof and Howard took
off his coat. He looked around. There were

31
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:43,850
three chairs, a sun umbrella, a sunbed, and
a table with three glasses and a bottle of

32
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:52,140
wine on it. There were tiles on the floor,
and next to the little wall around the edge

33
00:04:52,140 --> 00:05:00,120
of the roof, there were some flowers in boxes.
This was the 'garden'.

34
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,110
'Very nice,' said Howard.

35
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,790
Karin smiled at him.

36
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:18,190
'We don't see many good-looking men up here,'
she said. 'Sit down and have a drink.'

37
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:29,900
Howard's face went red again. He gave a shy
little laugh. 'Oh, er... thank you,' he said.

38
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:37,389
He tried not to look at Karin's long suntanned
legs, but it was not easy.

39
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:49,759
'I come up here all the time when it's sunny,'
Karin said. She began to put suntan oil on

40
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,389
her arms and legs.

41
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:56,590
Howard watched.

42
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:05,240
Then Marcia arrived, and the three of them
sat in the sun and drank wine. Marcia looked

43
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:13,840
at Howard with love in her eyes. She did not
look at Karin.

44
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:24,310
Karin watched them. Her eyes went from her
sister, to Howard, and back again to her sister.

45
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,310
She smiled.

46
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:32,069
It was not a nice smile.

47
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:41,870
Every Sunday morning after that, Marcia brought
Howard home for a glass of wine after church.

48
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:50,080
Howard stopped his car in the street outside
the apartment building, and Marcia said, 'Sound

49
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:58,410
the horn, Howard. Tell Karin we're here, then
she can get the wine ready.'

50
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:08,729
So Howard gave three little toots on his car
horn. On sunny days, Karin always came to

51
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:15,789
the wall at the edge of the roof, and looked
over to wave at them. Then she went to get

52
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:17,360
the wine.

53
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:28,910
She always wore her bikini or a very short
skirt. Marcia never wore short skirts or a

54
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,400
bikini.

55
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:42,360
'My legs are too fat for bikinis,' she told
Howard. 'Your legs are... very nice,' he said

56
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,780
shyly.

57
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:56,639
One day in June Karin asked Howard, 'What
time do you finish work, Howard?'

58
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,009
'About six o'clock,' he said.

59
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:09,930
'Could you bring me home after work?' Karin
said. 'My shop's very near the hospital - you

60
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:16,289
drive right past it. And you only live three
streets away from us.'

61
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:28,270
'There's a very good bus,' said Marcia quickly.
'It stops outside our building.'

62
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:37,140
'But the bus is so slow!' Karin said. 'Please,
Howard!'

63
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:46,321
Howard looked from one sister to the other.
'Oh, well... er, yes, all right then,' he

64
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:47,530
said.

65
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:55,990
'Thank you!' Karin said, and gave him a quick
kiss.

66
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:06,450
So every evening Howard drove Karin home.
On the first Friday, they were an hour late.

67
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:14,090
When they arrived, Marcia was at the door
of the apartment building.

68
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:22,070
'What happened?' she asked. 'Why are you so
late?'

69
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:33,010
'There was an accident,' Karin said. 'Three
cars, all across the road - on that hill by

70
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:44,120
the cinema, you know. We couldn't get past,
we couldn't go back. There were so many cars!

71
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,670
Nobody could move!'

72
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,600
Howard said nothing.

73
00:09:50,600 --> 00:10:02,810
It was a long, hot summer that year. Marcia
went to church every Sunday morning, and Karin

74
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:11,580
stayed at home with their father. When it
was sunny - and it often was - Karin went

75
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,640
up to her sunbed on the roof.

76
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:23,920
When Marcia went up to the roof garden, she
always sat under the umbrella. But Karin put

77
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,279
on lots of suntan oil and sat in the sun in
her bikini.

78
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:40,510
'The hot sun's not good for your body,' Marcia
said. Karin laughed. 'Howard likes my body.'

79
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:45,240
'No, he doesn't!' Marcia said angrily.

80
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:55,750
'Oh, he does!' Karin said. 'He's very shy
with women, but he always looks at my body

81
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:03,920
very carefully. He does it all the time. Perhaps
he wants me to take off-'

82
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:17,330
'Stop it, Karin!' Marcia said. 'Don't say
those things!' Karin laughed. 'What's the

83
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:24,149
matter, big sister? Are you afraid I'm going
to take him from you?'

84
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:29,230
Marcia did not answer.

85
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:35,540
The next Sunday, Howard phoned Marcia early
in the morning.

86
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:44,820
'I - I don't feel very well,' he said. 'I'm
not going to church today.'

87
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:54,089
'My love, I'm sorry,' Marcia said. 'Can I
phone you when I get home?'

88
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,160
'Yes, of course,' he said.

89
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:07,550
'I can't phone before one o'clock,' Marcia
said. 'I'm going to be late back because there's

90
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:13,240
a meeting after church. Something about Africa,
I think.'

91
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,550
'Oh yes, I remember,' Howard said.

92
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:29,180
But Marcia was wrong. There was no meeting
after church that morning. It was the next

93
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:37,820
Sunday. So she left church at the usual time
and arrived home at a quarter to twelve.

94
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:49,810
First, she went in to see her father, but
he was asleep. Then she phoned Howard, but

95
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,740
there was no answer.

96
00:12:51,740 --> 00:13:01,770
'Perhaps he's sleeping,' she thought. 'And
his mother doesn't want to answer the phone.'

97
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:12,579
She went to her room and put on a long summer
skirt. Then she went up to the roof garden.

98
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:24,180
She put her hand on the door to the roof...
and stopped. The door was half open and she

99
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:30,240
could hear voices. There was someone with
Karin.

100
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:40,910
A man. Howard. Howard? Marcia listened.

101
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:52,500
'I feel bad about this,' Howard said. 'We
must tell Marcia soon, Karin.'

102
00:13:52,500 --> 00:14:03,420
'No!' Karin said quickly. She gave a little
laugh. 'It's our secret, Howard. Only for

103
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,470
a little longer. All right?'

104
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,959
'I - I don't like...' he began.

105
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:26,740
'But you do love me, Howard,' Karin said.
'Not Marcia? Say you love me. Please!'

106
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,550
Marcia suddenly felt cold.

107
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:39,350
'You... you know I do,' Howard answered. 'But-'

108
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:50,269
Karin kissed him. 'It's our little secret.
Oh, is your car outside, my love? We don't

109
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:52,680
want Marcia to see it.'

110
00:14:52,680 --> 00:15:01,410
'I didn't bring my car,' Howard said. 'I walked
here.'

111
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:12,070
'Good,' Karin said. 'But it's getting late.
You must go, before she comes home.'

112
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,600
They kissed again.

113
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:23,880
'See you tomorrow, usual time, usual place,'
said Karin. 'Now, go!'

114
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:32,650
Marcia moved quickly and quietly away from
the roof door, and ran to her bedroom. She

115
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:38,149
did not want Howard or Karin to see her.

116
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:47,230
She heard their voices. Then the front door
of the apartment opened and closed. Howard

117
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,410
was gone.

118
00:15:49,410 --> 00:16:04,970
Marcia sat on her bed for an hour. 'Why, why,
why?' she thought. 'Why does she do it? I

119
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:15,079
stay at home with an old man all the time.
I can't go out to work, I can't make new friends,

120
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:26,570
I can't meet new people. I go shopping once
a week and I go to church once a week. That's

121
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:41,380
all. And then I met Howard. When he said "I
love you", I was so happy. And now...?'

122
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:53,139
Karin had everything. Good looks, a job, friends.
She was young, she was beautiful, she could

123
00:16:53,139 --> 00:17:02,089
have any man. So why Howard? Why, why, why?

124
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:11,559
'It's not because she wants him,' Marcia thought.
'It's because I love him. It's because she

125
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,919
doesn't want me to be happy.'

126
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:22,650
But you do love me, Howard. Not Marcia?

127
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,010
You know I do.

128
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:37,380
Was it true? Did Howard love Karin and not
her? No! He saw only the beautiful, suntanned

129
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,580
body. He didn't know her.

130
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,180
'She's not going to have him...' Marcia thought.

131
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:57,190
Every evening that week, Howard drove Karin
home after work. And every evening they got

132
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,230
later and later.

133
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:07,530
The next Sunday, Marcia didn't go to church.

134
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:16,810
'I've got a bad head,' she told Karin. 'I
just phoned Howard and told him, and he's

135
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:26,559
coming here after church as usual. I'm going
back to sleep for an hour or two.' And she

136
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,220
went into her bedroom and shut the door.

137
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:40,910
Later in the morning, when Karin was with
their father, Marcia went up to the roof garden.

138
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:49,620
Karin's bottle of suntan oil was on the table,
and Marcia smiled.

139
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:59,000
When Karin came up to the roof, Marcia was
in her chair under the umbrella with a book

140
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,510
in her hand.

141
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,890
'Oh, is your head better?' Karin asked.

142
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,020
'Yes, thanks,' Marcia said.

143
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:21,650
Karin wore her bikini, a new yellow one. She
opened her bottle of suntan oil.

144
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:34,110
'Oh, there's not much here,' she said. 'I
must get some more.' She began to put some

145
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,480
oil on her legs.

146
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:46,460
Twenty minutes later, Howard stopped his car
in the street below. Up on the roof, Karin

147
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:53,910
and Marcia heard the usual three little toots
on his car horn.

148
00:19:53,910 --> 00:20:03,330
'He's here,' Karin said excitedly. 'Your man's
here, big sister!' And she laughed.

149
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:10,470
Yes, Marcia thought. My man, not yours, Karin.

150
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:20,490
Karin jumped up from her sunbed. She ran to
the wall at the edge of the roof to look down

151
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:29,570
and wave to Howard. She had no shoes on, and
at the wall, her feet suddenly slipped away

152
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,840
from under her.

153
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,320
'Aaagh!' she cried.

154
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:44,059
She fell forward, and put out her hands to
grab the wall. But the top of the wall was

155
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:55,520
slippery too. Her hands could not hold it,
and slipped away, off the wall, over the edge.

156
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:03,450
And her body went on too, over the edge of
the wall, and down...

157
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:09,480
Down... down... down...

158
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,340
Before she hit the ground, she knew.

159
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,490
Slippery... suntan oil... Marcia...

160
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,850
- THE END -
