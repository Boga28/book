00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,730
CHAPTER ONE
A Bad Start

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,720
I'm here, in Norwich!

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,709
Goodbye to my job in Jack's Cafe in London
for six days!

4
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:15,440
I feel very, very happy.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,930
I want to laugh and shout, and tell everyone
about it.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,340
I'm going to be in a film with Fabio Facelli!

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,170
Yes, me, Sophia Reynolds, with Fabio Facelli!

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,850
I love Fabio's films.

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,410
And now I'm going to be in a film with him!

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,199
OK, it isn't just Fabio and me in the film.

11
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:42,379
There are going to be lots of people.

12
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:44,899
And I'm an 'extra'.

13
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:48,769
I'm not going to speak, but I'm going to be
in the film.

14
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:50,769
With Fabio Facelli!

15
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:52,780
It's eight o'clock.

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,469
I must be at Chapelfield Park at ten o'clock.

17
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,070
I have two hours.

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,539
First I can take my bag to my hotel.

19
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,670
I start to walk, but a woman stops me.

20
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,729
'Excuse me.

21
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,900
Can you tell me how to get to Bank Street?'

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,680
she asks.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,780
I smile at the woman.

24
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,000
'I don't know Norwich, but I've got a map,'
I tell her.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,799
'Thank you,' says the woman.

26
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,960
The map is big and it's a windy day.

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,440
My hair is over my face and I can't see.

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,390
I try to find Bank Street.

29
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,430
But the wind takes the map from my hands.

30
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,760
'Oh!'

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,840
I start to laugh.

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,109
The woman tries to help, but the wind is taking
my map away.

33
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:48,359
'Come back here!'

34
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,250
I shout and I run down the street after the
map.

35
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,729
The map goes under a bus.

36
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:58,640
I wait for the bus to stop.

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,249
Then I go and get the map.

38
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:04,920
I walk back up the street, but I can't see
the woman.

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,820
I look for her up and down the street.

40
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,950
'That's funny,' I think.

41
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,200
I put the map back in my bag.

42
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,569
Then I see that something's wrong.

43
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,930
'These aren't my things!'

44
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,420
I say.

45
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,400
'This isn't my bag!

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,840
Oh no, she's got my bag!'

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,709
I look up and down the street again, but the
woman isn't there.

48
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,629
I don't know what to do.

49
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:35,840
Everything's going wrong.

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,190
First the map, now my bag.

51
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,640
Then I see something - a police station.

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,171
I take the woman's bag and start to run.

53
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:50,670
I run to the police station, and I go in.

54
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,760
'My bag!'

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,840
I shout at a policeman behind the desk.

56
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
'She's got my bag.

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,060
You must help me.

58
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,610
Please!'

59
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,650
CHAPTER TWO
Beautiful Eyes

60
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,439
The policeman doesn't look up at me.

61
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,500
He's writing something.

62
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,989
'Sit down please, Miss,' he says.

63
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:17,640
I don't want to sit down.

64
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,819
I want him to run into the street with me.

65
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,549
I want him to help me.

66
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,799
'You don't understand!'

67
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,299
I say.

68
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,720
'That bag's got all my things in it!'

69
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
The policeman looks up at me.

70
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,230
I see he has beautiful, dark eyes.

71
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,680
Not like Fabio's eyes, of course.

72
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,930
But they are beautiful.

73
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,299
What?

74
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,909
Why am I thinking about this man's eyes?

75
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:50,319
That woman's got my bag!

76
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,989
'All these people are waiting, Miss,' the
policeman tells me.

77
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,760
'Please sit down.'

78
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,200
I look behind me.

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,599
There are three or four people waiting.

80
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,810
They all want to speak to the policeman too.

81
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,950
'But I must be at work by ten o'clock!'

82
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,160
I try again, but the policeman just looks
at me.

83
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,440
'Please, Miss,' he says.

84
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,859
'I know,' I say.

85
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,410
'Sit down.'

86
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,120
I go and sit down.

87
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,770
And I wait.

88
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,110
And wait.

89
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,830
After thirty minutes, the policeman asks me
to go over.

90
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,310
'Sit down, please,' he tells me.

91
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,010
I sit.

92
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,070
'Name?' he asks.

93
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,860
'Sophia Reynolds.'

94
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,330
He writes it down.

95
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,180
'And how can we help you?'

96
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,130
I tell him about the woman and our bags.

97
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,400
'Now she's got my bag and I've got hers!'

98
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,180
I say, and I give him the woman's bag.

99
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,729
He takes the bag from me and opens it.

100
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:05,080
'There's no name in here,' he says.

101
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,380
'We don't know how to find the woman.'

102
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,330
'What can we do?'

103
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,120
I ask.

104
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,270
The policeman puts the bag down.

105
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,509
'You must leave it here,' he says.

106
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:22,320
'Now, tell me what's in your bag,' he says.

107
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,229
I tell him and he writes it all down.

108
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,039
'OK, Miss Reynolds,' he says.

109
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,979
'We must wait for the woman to come in.

110
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,290
Come back this afternoon.

111
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,030
Or phone us.'

112
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,650
He writes the phone number down and gives
it to me.

113
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,620
'Give me your number too,' he says.

114
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,139
I give him my number and get up.

115
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,740
'Thank you,' I say.

116
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,740
'Goodbye.'

117
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,980
'Goodbye, Miss Reynolds,' he says, and then
he looks away from me.

118
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,190
'Next please!' he calls.

119
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,910
A man comes over.

120
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,280
'Sit down, please,' the policeman says.

121
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,319
'Mr Sit Down,' I think.

122
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,919
'That's a good name for you!'

123
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,621
CHAPTER THREE
Mr Sit Down

124
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:19,910
Out in the street I look for Chapelfield Park
on my map.

125
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,930
Good - it's not far.

126
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,520
I can get there by ten o'clock.

127
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,250
I start to walk.

128
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,530
Then I hear something and look down.

129
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,860
A small boy is next to me.

130
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,900
He looks about three or four.

131
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,360
And he's crying.

132
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,830
'Hello,' I say.

133
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,300
'Where's your mother?'

134
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,950
The boy doesn't answer.

135
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,950
He just cries.

136
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,050
I take his hand.

137
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,120
'Don't cry,' I say.

138
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,360
I look up and down the street, but I can't
see the boy's mother.

139
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,660
I know what to do.

140
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,780
I smile at the boy.

141
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,320
'Come on,' I say.

142
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,120
'Come and see Mr Sit Down with me.

143
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,449
He's a policeman.'

144
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:13,699
The boy walks with me down the street.

145
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,000
He doesn't stop crying.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,680
We go into the police station and everyone
looks at us.

147
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,990
The boy is crying loudly.

148
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,210
My policeman is speaking to a woman at his
desk.

149
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,030
I take the boy over to the desk and the policeman
looks up.

150
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,150
'Miss Reynolds,' the policeman says.

151
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,780
I speak fast.

152
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,910
'This boy can't find his mother,' I tell him.

153
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:47,500
'Excuse me,' the policeman says to the woman
at his desk.

154
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,110
He gets up and comes over to the boy.

155
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,870
His face is kind.

156
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,979
'What's your name?' he asks the boy.

157
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:59,199
The boy stops crying.

158
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,940
'Peter,' he says.

159
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,480
Then he looks at the policeman.

160
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,090
'Are you Mr Sit Down?' he asks.

161
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,090
'Oh help!'

162
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,090
I think.

163
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,740
The policeman looks at me.

164
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,030
His eyes are smiling.

165
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,500
I want to die.

166
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,919
'I'm PC George Cooper,' he tells the boy.

167
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,290
'George,' I think.

168
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,990
'His name's George.'

169
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,500
Then a woman runs into the police station.

170
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
'Peter!'

171
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,990
she shouts.

172
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,410
'Peter!'

173
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,530
She runs over to the boy.

174
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,990
Peter starts crying again.

175
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,710
'Mummy!' he says.

176
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,490
George gets up.

177
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,610
He smiles at me.

178
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,420
I smile too.

179
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,620
Everyone is happy.

180
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,901
'Thank you for your help, Miss Reynolds,'
George says.

181
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:57,830
'Excuse me,' says the woman at George's desk.

182
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,420
'I must be at work in ten minutes.'

183
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,820
Work!

184
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,530
The film!

185
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,600
I'm going to be late!

186
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,540
'Goodbye,' I say to George.

187
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,540
'See you this afternoon.'

188
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,160
And I run out of the police station.

189
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,460
CHAPTER FOUR
Two angry men

190
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:24,030
I wait to go across the street.

191
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,790
There are lots of cars.

192
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,790
I start to think about Fabio Facelli.

193
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,260
Is he in Chapelfield Park now?

194
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,180
There's a red car coming very fast.

195
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:43,020
The car in front of it stops, and the fast
red car drives into it.

196
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,020
Crash!

197
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,470
I run over to the front car.

198
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,860
The window is open.

199
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,901
'Are you OK?'

200
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:54,920
I ask the man in the car.

201
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,940
'My new car!'

202
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,880
the man says.

203
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
He gets out.

204
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,430
He looks at his car.

205
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,700
Then he goes over to the red car behind.

206
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,570
He starts to shout at the man in the red car.

207
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,370
'Look at my car!'

208
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,420
The man in the red car gets out.

209
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,910
He looks angry too.

210
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,980
'Look at my car!' he says.

211
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,580
I look at them.

212
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,040
Oh no!

213
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,100
I don't want to go into the police station
again!

214
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,030
I can't go in there again!

215
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,850
But the men are shouting now.

216
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,320
People are stopping and looking.

217
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,110
Why don't they go into the police station
for help?

218
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,520
But they don't.

219
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,700
So I go.

220
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,970
George is at his desk.

221
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,860
'Miss Reynolds!' he says.

222
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,460
'Please come,' I say.

223
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,950
'There's going to be a fight!'

224
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,580
George gets up quickly and comes with me.

225
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,660
There's a lot of noise out in the street.

226
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,890
The two men are fighting now.

227
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,920
I don't like it.

228
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,540
They're big men and they're very angry.

229
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,570
George runs over.

230
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,580
I watch George at work.

231
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:22,980
I don't know why, but I think about Fabio
Facelli in his film 'Bad Men Die'.

232
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,100
Fabio Facelli!

233
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,100
The film!

234
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,520
I must get to Chapelfield Park now!

235
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,640
I leave George with the angry men and run
up the street.

236
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,020
CHAPTER FIVE
Shouting for Fabio

237
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,521
I get to Chapelfield Park at 9.59.

238
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:46,410
I'm not late, but I don't look good.

239
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,740
Because of the wind, my hair is everywhere.

240
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,330
It is a bad hair day.

241
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,800
But by 10.30 I don't look like Sophia Reynolds.

242
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:05,100
'Beautiful Young Things' is a 1960s film,
and all the extras have 1960s hair.

243
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,260
'From bad hair day to big hair day!'

244
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,360
I think.

245
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,480
In the film Fabio Facelli is a famous singer,
Ricky Burns.

246
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,240
All the extras are going to watch him sing.

247
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,880
I can't believe it - in a minute I'm going
to see Fabio Facelli!

248
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,690
'OK,' says the film director.

249
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,330
'You're all here to see the famous Ricky Burns.

250
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,340
You love Ricky Burns!

251
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,680
And any minute he's going to be here!

252
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,810
I want you all to shout for Ricky.

253
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,340
OK!'

254
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,140
Everyone starts to shout.

255
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,190
'Ricky!

256
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,240
Ricky!'

257
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,400
Then a man comes over.

258
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,700
He's tall with dark hair and beautiful eyes.

259
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,720
'Fabio!'

260
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,790
I start to shout.

261
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,810
'Fabio!'

262
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,460
'Stop!' says the film director.

263
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,800
'Shout out for Ricky, not Fabio, please!'

264
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
the director says.

265
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,060
'Oh no!'

266
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,910
I think.

267
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:18,780
'Sorry, Fabio,' the film director says to
the tall man with dark hair.

268
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,690
Fabio Facelli's eyes look cold.

269
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,420
'That's funny,' I think, 'they never look
cold in his films.'

270
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,390
He walks away again.

271
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:34,090
'OK!' says the film director and we start
to shout again.

272
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,740
This time I shout out, 'Ricky!'

273
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,250
We shout and shout and shout.

274
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,730
After thirty minutes I can't talk because
of all the shouting.

275
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,370
'OK,' says the film director to us.

276
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,310
'We're going to stop for ten minutes and have
a drink.'

277
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,690
I have a drink and then I go to find my phone.

278
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,500
I want to phone George about my bag.

279
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,624
But I've got a text from him.

280
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:05,624
He's got my bag!

281
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:06,770
'OK, everyone!'

282
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,100
I hear the director shout.

283
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,050
I put my phone away and run out.

284
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,540
Crash!

285
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,070
I run into a man.

286
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,890
It's Fabio Facelli!

287
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,140
'Why don't you look where you're going?'

288
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,400
Fabio shouts at me.

289
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,480
'Look at my trousers!'

290
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,820
'Sorry,' I start to say.

291
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,940
But Fabio doesn't stop to listen.

292
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,560
I watch him go.

293
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,660
'You have beautiful eyes,' I think, 'but you're
not a beautiful man.'

294
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,910
Then I think about another man's eyes.

295
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,410
Dark eyes.

296
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,970
PC George Cooper's eyes.

297
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,451
CHAPTER SIX
A George Cooper film

298
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:57,331
We stop work at five o'clock.

299
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:58,740
What a day!

300
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,080
I feel very tired.

301
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,360
I walk slowly to the police station to get
my bag.

302
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,070
Next to the police station, a man speaks to
me.

303
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,520
'Miss Reynolds?

304
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,700
Is that you?'

305
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,740
I look up and see a man on a big motorbike.

306
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,110
It's George!

307
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,730
I smile and go up to him.

308
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,650
'Thank you for your text,' I say.

309
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,860
He smiles at me.

310
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,380
He looks very good in black on his motorbike.

311
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,980
'I'm just doing my job, Miss Reynolds.'

312
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,780
He's looking at my hair.

313
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,830
Is that why he's smiling like that?

314
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,740
Or does he like me?

315
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,010
'Please call me Sophia,' I tell him.

316
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,450
'Well, thank you for your help today, Sophia,'
he says.

317
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,150
He looks at my hair again.

318
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:59,110
'Your hair is very... big this evening,' he
says.

319
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,170
I laugh.

320
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,080
'Yes,' I say.

321
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,720
'I'm having a big hair day.

322
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,160
They're making a film in Chapelfield Park.

323
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,600
I'm an extra in it.'

324
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,411
'You're going to be famous then?' he asks.

325
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:20,910
I think about Fabio Facelli and his cold eyes.

326
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,740
But George is smiling at me and I don't feel
sad.

327
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,880
'No,' I say, 'I'm not going to be famous.'

328
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,250
George looks at me.

329
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,870
'Are you going to get your bag?' he asks.

330
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,940
'Yes,' I say, but I don't want to walk away
from him.

331
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,180
I don't want him to go.

332
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,810
Does he know what I'm thinking?

333
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,360
'Do you want to go for a drink?' he asks.

334
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,260
'Get your bag first.

335
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,830
I can wait for you.'

336
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,580
I smile a very big smile.

337
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,700
'Yes,' I say.

338
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,720
'Yes, please!'

339
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,930
'Good,' he says.

340
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,310
We don't just have a drink.

341
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,721
We talk and we laugh a lot.

342
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:10,329
And he kisses me.

343
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:15,660
It feels like a film, when the boy gets the
girl.

344
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,390
Only this isn't a Fabio Facelli film, it's
a George Cooper film.

345
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:30,430
George Cooper films are very good!

346
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:35,430
- THE END -
