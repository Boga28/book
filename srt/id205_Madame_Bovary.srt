CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,360
Failure and Success

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,440
The older Monsieur Bovary, Monsieur 
Charles Denis Bartholome Bovary,  

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,560
had been a good-looking man when younger, 
with a big moustache and rings on his fingers.  

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,760
He was not, however, an impressive man, 
and although he wore expensive clothes,  

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,320
he always looked like an uncomfortable mixture 
of a military man and a cheap shopkeeper. His  

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,400
good looks and ability to sell himself did, 
nevertheless, win him a wife with a good income.  

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,840
After he was safely married, he lived for two or 
three years on her money. He ate and drank well,  

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,840
and spent his days lying in bed till midday,  

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,320
smoking his pipe and never coming home 
till the theatres and cafes closed.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,360
When his father-in-law died, the old man 
left very little money to his daughter.  

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,520
Disappointed, Monsieur Bovary tried to start a 
textile business, but lost a lot of money and  

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,520
finally retired into the country with the idea 
of showing the people there how to run a farm.  

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,920
However, he knew as little about agriculture as he 
did about textiles. He rode his horses instead of  

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,560
making them work, ate the fattest chickens instead 
of selling them, and cleaned his shooting-boots  

16
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,760
with his own best bacon-fat. He soon discovered 
that he had little chance of making a fortune.

17
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,080
Around this time he found a place on the 
borders of Caux and Picardy, half farm,  

18
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,960
half private house, which he could rent for two 
hundred francs a year. He took it and there,  

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,240
an angry, disappointed man, at war with the rest 
of the world, he shut himself up at the age of  

20
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:07,840
forty-five. He said that he was disgusted with 
other people and wanted only to live by himself.

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,280
At the beginning, his wife had 
loved him above all others,  

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,920
but this only seemed to add to his dislike of 
the world and he never had a kind word for her.  

23
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,080
She had been cheerful, kind-hearted 
and friendly, but as she grew older,  

24
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,080
in the same way that good wine turns into 
vinegar, she became bad-tempered and bad company.  

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,760
She was a hard worker, though, unlike her 
husband. She was always on her feet, always busy,  

26
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,920
hurrying to see the lawyers, knowing exactly 
when the next bills had to be paid. Indoors  

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,320
she was always working: sewing, washing, keeping 
an eye on the men and paying them their wages.  

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,240
Her lord and master, paying no attention to what 
was going on around him, sat smoking by the fire.

29
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,640
When the first Madame Bovary had a 
child, it became the centre of her  

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,400
world. The child's father, however, would 
have been happy to let him go without shoes.  

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,520
He said that it would be more natural not to 
give him clothes and to let him run around  

32
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,840
like a young animal. In contrast to his wife's 
ideas, he thought a boy would grow up to be a  

33
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,000
better man if he undressed in the cold, learned to 
drink alcohol and laughed at the village priest.  

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,400
The child, a gentle little thing, made 
little progress in this kind of education.  

35
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,720
His mother always kept him close to her; she 
cut out pictures for him from the newspaper  

36
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,400
and made up countless stories. In loving her son, 
she was looking for something to make up for the  

37
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,600
loneliness of her life. She dreamed he would be 
famous. She could see him as a tall, handsome,  

38
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:00,480
clever man, high up in the government service. 
She taught him to read, and to sing - while she  

39
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,600
played on her old piano. Monsieur Bovary said this 
was all a waste of time. How were they ever going  

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:15,040
to afford to educate him for a government job, or 
help him start in business? Madame Bovary bit her  

41
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,200
lip and did not argue with her husband, and the 
child was allowed to run wild in the village.

42
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,920
He went around with the farm workers, scared 
the birds by throwing stones at them, looked  

43
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:34,240
for wild fruit, helped in the fields, wandered 
through the woods and played with other children.  

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,480
On Saints' days, he helped 
ring the bells in the church,  

45
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,600
and he loved to hang on to the big rope and 
feel himself carried up as it rose in the air.  

46
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,360
And he grew as strong as a young oak 
tree, with big hands and red cheeks.

47
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,000
When he reached the age of twelve, his 
mother managed to arrange for him to begin  

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,480
his studies with the priest, but the lessons were 
so short and badly organized that they did not do  

49
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:09,920
him much good. Sometimes it would be hot and the 
child would grow tired, and before long the old  

50
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:16,560
man would be sleeping with his mouth wide open. At 
other times the priest would see Charles playing  

51
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,640
with his friends and would call him over to test 
his Latin verbs. But then, perhaps, it would begin  

52
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,680
to rain, or someone they knew would come along, 
and lessons would be over for that day. The priest  

53
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,640
always had a good word for his pupil, though, and 
said that the young man had a very good memory.

54
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,760
By the time young Charles was thirteen, even 
his father saw that something must be done,  

55
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,160
and Charles left his unhappy home to spend 
three unhappy years in the College at Rouen.  

56
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,480
He wrote to his mother every 
week; he did his homework.  

57
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,080
He never did very well in his studies, but he 
never failed altogether. At the end of three  

58
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,840
years, his mother took him away from the College, 
with the plan that he should study medicine.

59
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,560
She got him a room on the fourth floor of a house 
overlooking a little river. She made arrangements  

60
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,800
for his meals, found some bits of furniture - a 
table and a couple of chairs and an old bed - and  

61
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,840
made sure there was plenty of firewood to keep 
her poor boy warm. After a week of preparations  

62
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:34,160
she went back home, asking him over and over 
again to look after himself and to study hard.

63
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,800
The list of lectures which he read at the 
beginning of the term made his head spin.  

64
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,480
There were lectures on subjects he had never 
heard of, with names he could not even pronounce.  

65
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,640
He listened as hard as he could, but he could not 
understand what the lecturers were talking about.  

66
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,000
However, he attended every lecture 
and filled notebook after notebook.  

67
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,920
He got through his work like a horse that is 
used to turn a mill-wheel, going round and round  

68
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,920
in the same place with his eyes covered, never 
knowing what he was doing or where he was going.

69
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,040
Charles failed his medical examinations the 
first time - the course was too difficult for  

70
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,720
him. But his mother still believed in him, 
and made his father pay for one more year.  

71
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,800
This time Charles managed to pass 
and his mother began to plan again.  

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,360
First he must have somewhere to 
work, and then he must have a wife.

73
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,440
The first problem was solved when the old 
doctor in Tostes, a small town near Rouen, died.  

74
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:49,760
Charles became the next doctor. Then his 
mother found a 45-year-old widow in Dieppe,  

75
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,320
with an income of twelve hundred francs a year.  

76
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,000
Though she was ugly and bad-tempered (and 
twenty-five years older than Charles),  

77
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,680
her income made her attractive and Charles 
thought the marriage would make his life better.  

78
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:12,720
He thought he would now have freedom and money 
to spend. He was wrong. His wife was in charge.  

79
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,960
She told him what to say, and what not to say. 
She opened his letters, watched his movements  

80
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,760
and, when women patients were in the 
surgery, she listened from the next room.  

81
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,520
At night, when Charles came to bed, she put her 
long bony arms round his neck and told him all her  

82
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:39,120
troubles. He did not love her, he loved someone 
else. Yes, she knew she would always be unhappy.  

83
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,120
And she always ended by asking him for some 
medicine - and for a little more love.
 
 
 

84
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,200
CHAPTER TWO

85
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,320
Mademoiselle Emma

86
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,800
One night, Charles received a letter asking him 
to come at once to a farm at Les Bertaux where the  

87
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,840
farmer had broken his leg. The night was dark 
and the farm was twenty-five kilometres away,  

88
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,080
but the farmer was a rich man and Charles was 
still building up his business. So at four o'clock  

89
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:22,240
in the morning, Dr Bovary set out. A child was 
waiting at an open gate as he approached the farm.

90
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
'Are you the doctor?' he asked.

91
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,320
As Charles rode along, he learned from 
the boy that Monsieur Rouault had broken  

92
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,720
his leg the night before. He also learned 
that he had lost his wife two years ago,  

93
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,360
and had no one with him now except for his 
daughter, who looked after the house for him.

94
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,760
Mademoiselle Emma, the farmer's daughter, came 
to the door and showed him into the kitchen.  

95
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,600
A fire was burning and the men's dinner 
was cooking in big polished pans.  

96
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,920
Charles went upstairs to see the farmer. 
The broken leg was a simple problem  

97
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,840
and Charles asked the servant and the 
young woman to help with the patient.  

98
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,400
As they tied up the farmer's leg, Charles was 
surprised to see how white her nails were.  

99
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,520
Her hands, however, were not beautiful 
- perhaps a little too red. She herself  

100
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:24,240
was too tall, and she did not have the kind 
of soft figure Charles liked. Her good point  

101
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,840
was her eyes. They were dark, almost black, 
and she looked at you honestly and fearlessly.

102
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,560
As soon as he had finished looking after 
his patient, the doctor was invited by  

103
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:45,440
Monsieur Rouault to eat before he left. Charles 
went down into the room below, where two places  

104
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,520
had been laid with shining silver on a small 
table and Mademoiselle Emma was waiting for him.  

105
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,720
A smell of flowers and clean 
clothes came from a cupboard  

106
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,080
opposite the window and on the floor, in 
the corner, stood a few bags of wheat.  

107
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,720
Someone had hung a drawing of a Greek 
god in the middle of one of the walls.  

108
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,840
It was in an attractive frame, and written at 
the bottom were the words 'To my dear Father'.

109
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,080
They began by talking about Monsieur 
Rouault, and went on to discuss the  

110
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,080
weather and the cold winter. Mademoiselle 
Emma did not like the country very much,  

111
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,760
especially now she had almost all the 
responsibility of the farm on her shoulders.

112
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,560
When Charles, who had been upstairs to say goodbye 
to the farmer, came back into the dining room,  

113
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,400
he found her standing by the window looking 
out into the garden. She turned round.

114
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,040
'Are you looking for something?' she asked.

115
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,840
'Yes, I'm trying to find my 
riding-whip,' he replied,  

116
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,680
and he began to look behind 
the doors and under the chairs.

117
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,520
Mademoiselle Emma found it between the bags of 
wheat and the wall, and Charles went over to help.  

118
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,760
As he bent down, he felt the young woman's 
back rubbing against his chest. She stood up,  

119
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,320
blushing, and, looking at him over 
her shoulder, handed him his whip.

120
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,480
Instead of going back to Les Bertaux three days 
later, as he said he would, he returned the next  

121
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:34,960
day, and he then went to the farm twice a week. 
After forty-six days, Monsieur Rouault could move  

122
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,320
around without help, and people began to say 
what an excellent doctor Monsieur Bovary was.  

123
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,600
Pere Rouault said the very best doctors in Yvetot 
or Rouen itself could not have treated him better.

124
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,040
Charles did not ask himself why 
he liked going to Les Bertaux.  

125
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,720
If he had thought about it he would have 
said to himself that it was a serious case,  

126
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,440
or he expected to earn a good fee. But was that 
really the reason why these visits to the farm  

127
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,240
were so pleasant? On days when he was visiting, 
he got up early and rode to the farm as quickly  

128
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,160
as he could, only stopping to clean his boots and 
to put on his black gloves before going into the  

129
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,640
house. He liked to ride into the yard, and see 
the farm boys as they came forward to meet him.  

130
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,360
He liked the house, and Monsieur Rouault, who 
held his hand and said he had saved his life;  

131
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,200
he liked the sound of Mademoiselle Emma's wooden 
shoes on the clean stone floor of the kitchen.

132
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,200
When he left, she always came 
with him to the top of the steps,  

133
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,680
and would wait with him until 
the boys brought his horse.  

134
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,760
One day, at the end of the winter, it 
started to rain as he was leaving the house.  

135
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,920
She went back inside for an umbrella and put it 
up. It was a silk one, and it caught the sunlight,  

136
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,160
reflecting little coloured patches of 
light on to the whiteness of her skin.  

137
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,240
She smiled at him, and you could hear 
the sound of the rain drops as they fell,  

138
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
one by one, on to the tight surface of the silk.

139
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,360
When Charles first began his visits to Les 
Bertaux, his wife always asked about his patient.  

140
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,040
But when she learned that the farmer's daughter 
had been to school and had learned dancing,  

141
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,080
geography and drawing, and could play the piano, 
her interest changed to anger and dislike.  

142
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,880
At first she made unfriendly remarks about 
Mademoiselle Rouault, but Charles ignored them  

143
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,840
because he did not want an argument. So at last 
she told him to his face what she thought of him,  

144
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,960
and he did not know what to reply. 
Why did he keep going to Les Bertaux?  

145
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,400
Monsieur Rouault was well again 
now and he had not paid his bill.  

146
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,960
Ah, she knew all about it! There was someone 
else there, someone who was a good talker,  

147
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,040
someone who was well educated and clever. 
That was what he liked - young, pretty ladies!

148
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,760
So Charles agreed to stop his visits to 
Les Bertaux, but now that he could not see  

149
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:24,160
Mademoiselle Emma he decided he could love her. 
His wife was so unattractive, just skin and bone.  

150
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,000
She wore the same black clothes and gray 
stockings, the same ugly shoes all year round.  

151
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,160
So if he could not see the farmer's 
daughter any more, he would dream of her!

152
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,200
This unhappy situation lasted for several 
months until, one fine day in the early spring,  

153
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,960
the lawyer who had looked after Madame Bovary's 
affairs left town with all his clients' money.  

154
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,320
She still had a share in a ship 
that was worth six thousand francs,  

155
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,840
and her house in Dieppe, but there was nothing 
left of that fortune she had been so proud of.

156
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,480
And when her financial affairs 
were looked into more carefully,  

157
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:14,080
Charles's father found out that the house in 
Dieppe was mortgaged and her share in the vessel  

158
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:22,480
was not worth more than two hundred francs. She 
had lied, the good lady! Monsieur Bovary senior  

159
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,880
was so angry that he took up a chair 
and smashed it on the stone floor,  

160
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,240
and he told his wife she had ruined her son 
by making him marry an old woman like that.  

161
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,440
They came to Tostes to tell Charles's 
rich wife what they thought of her.  

162
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,760
There was a terrible argument. Heloise begged 
her husband to defend her against his parents,  

163
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,840
and Charles did his best, but the old people 
were still angry when they left the house.

164
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,360
The damage had been done. A week later, as 
she was hanging out the washing in the yard,  

165
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,920
Heloise Bovary found that she was spitting blood. 
The next day, while Charles had his back to her,  

166
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:13,200
opening the curtains, she cried out, 'Oh God!' 
and fell to the floor. She was dead! How amazing!

167
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,920
When the funeral was over, 
Charles returned to the house.  

168
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:26,240
He went up into the bedroom and saw her 
dress hanging up at the foot of the bed. He  

169
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:34,880
stayed there until it was dark, lost in sorrowful 
thought. After all, perhaps she had loved him.
 
 
 

170
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,280
CHAPTER THREE

171
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,360
A New Wife

172
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,360
One morning Pere Rouault came to pay Charles 
for his treatment, and to say how sorry he was  

173
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,960
to hear about his wife's death. Seeing how unhappy 
Charles looked, he said, 'You must make an effort,  

174
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:05,280
Monsieur Bovary; you will be happy again one day. 
Come and see us. My daughter asks about you and  

175
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,600
says that you are forgetting her. Spring will 
soon be here. Come and shoot a rabbit or two!'

176
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,360
Charles took his advice. He 
went back to Les Bertaux,  

177
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,360
and found everything there just the same as 
before. The apple trees were already in flower,  

178
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:29,760
and Pere Rouault did his best to make the doctor 
feel comfortable. He even told him a few stories,  

179
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,600
and Charles was surprised to find himself 
laughing. When he remembered his wife  

180
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:42,320
he became serious again, but then the coffee 
came in and he thought no more about her.

181
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,880
Back home, he also thought of her less 
and less as he got used to living alone.  

182
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,800
He was free now to have his meals when he liked,  

183
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,480
he could go out and come in without having to 
give explanations, and when he was very tired  

184
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,720
he could stretch out his arms and legs in bed as 
far as he liked. He gave himself little treats,  

185
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,880
let himself feel self-pity and let people be 
nice to him. Moreover, his wife's death had been  

186
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,240
rather good for him professionally because, 
for a whole month, people had been saying,  

187
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,840
'Poor young man! What bad luck!' So his name 
had been heard and his practice had increased  

188
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:32,720
and he could go to Les Bertaux whenever he wanted 
to. He was strangely happy and, looking at himself  

189
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,840
in the mirror as he brushed his moustache, 
he thought he had become better-looking.

190
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,080
He arrived at the farm one day at about three 
o'clock when everyone was out in the fields.  

191
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:52,080
He went into the kitchen, but did not see Emma at 
first. The sunlight shone on the kitchen floor in  

192
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,960
long narrow bars, reflecting on the ceiling. Flies 
on the table crawled up the glasses that had not  

193
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,840
been washed, or drowned in the cider in the bottom 
of a jug. Between the window and the fireplace  

194
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,280
Emma sat sewing. She had no scarf around her neck, 
and he could see the fine hairs on her shoulders.

195
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:23,280
Like all country people, she offered him a drink. 
He said no at first, but at last, with a laugh,  

196
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,880
she persuaded him to have a glass with her. She 
went to the cupboard and brought out the bottle,  

197
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:36,640
took down two small glasses, filled one, poured 
two or three drops into the other and, tapping it  

198
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:44,240
against the doctor's, put it to her lips. As it 
was nearly empty, she leaned back to drink and,  

199
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:51,200
with her head back, she began to laugh because 
she could not taste anything. At the same time,  

200
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,760
she tried to catch some of the drops from the 
bottom of the glass with the tip of her tongue.

201
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,440
Then she sat down and took up her work again 
- a white cotton sock which she was repairing.  

202
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:11,680
She worked with her head bent forward. She did 
not talk, nor did Charles. As he watched her,  

203
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,200
the only sound he could hear was the excitement 
of a hen that had laid an egg in the yard outside.

204
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,240
After some time, Emma started to talk to him. 
She had been complaining ever since the spring  

205
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,680
about feeling dizzy; she wondered whether 
bathing in the sea would do her any good.  

206
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,440
She began to talk about her convent 
school, and Charles about his college days.  

207
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,920
They went upstairs to her room, where she showed 
him her old music books and the prizes she had  

208
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:49,360
won. And she went on to speak of her mother, 
and even pointed out the bed in the garden  

209
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,720
where she gathered flowers on the first Friday 
in every month, to lay on her mothers grave.  

210
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,800
She said she would like to live in town in 
the winter, although perhaps the long days  

211
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,840
made the country even more boring in the 
summer; and according to what she was saying,  

212
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:12,320
her voice was clear and strong, musical or almost 
a whisper, as if she were speaking to herself.

213
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,120
That night, as he was riding home, Charles 
thought about the different things she had said,  

214
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,880
trying to remember them exactly 
to discover what they meant,  

215
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,760
so that he might understand how her 
life had been before he met her.  

216
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Then he began to wonder how she would become 
if she married - and whom she would marry.  

217
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:46,240
Unfortunately, old Rouault was apparently 
very wealthy, and she herself... so beautiful!  

218
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:54,320
But the thought kept coming to him: 'The doctor 
wants a wife. Yes, the doctor wants a wife.'

219
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:03,440
That night he could not sleep. He got up, took a 
drink from the water-jug and opened his window.  

220
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:11,520
The sky was filled with stars, a warm 
breeze was blowing and, a long way off,  

221
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:18,720
some dogs were barking. He turned his head 
towards Les Bertaux. Thinking that, after all,  

222
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,840
he had nothing to lose by it, Charles made up his 
mind to ask her to marry him. But every time he  

223
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,840
was alone with her, the fear of being unable to 
find the right words left him unable to speak.

224
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,520
In fact Pere Rouault would have been 
happy to see his daughter married,  

225
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,840
especially as she was very little use in the 
house. He made excuses for her, telling himself  

226
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,680
that she had too much intelligence for the farming 
life. When, therefore, he noticed that Charles  

227
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,960
blushed each time he was near his daughter, and 
that the young man was clearly interested in her,  

228
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,720
he gave the matter some thought. Although 
Charles was not the sort of man he would have  

229
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,640
chosen for a son-in-law, he was well educated 
and a hard worker, and would not ask him for  

230
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,800
too much money to take his daughter off his 
hands. This mattered, as Monsieur Rouault had  

231
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,840
debts with most of his suppliers and had 
just had to sell a large amount of land.

232
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,280
'If he asks me,' he said to 
himself, 'he can have her.'

233
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:32,800
A little later, Charles came to spend three 
days at Les Bertaux. The time went quickly,  

234
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,360
and he never seemed to find 
the right moment to speak.  

235
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,720
As he was leaving, Monsieur Rouault 
came out to see him on his way.  

236
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,600
They had reached a bend in the road and were 
preparing to say goodbye. It was now or never.  

237
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,280
Charles gave himself until the corner of the 
field and at last, when they had passed it,  

238
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:59,840
he said, almost in a whisper, 'Monsieur Rouault, 
there is something I want to say to you.'

239
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,920
They stopped. Charles could not speak.

240
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,120
'Come on then, out with it! Do you 
think I don't know what it's all about?'  

241
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,840
said the farmer, laughing quietly.

242
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,080
'Pere Rouault... Pere Rouault...'

243
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,840
'Well,' the farmer went on,  

244
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,280
'there's nothing I would like better. But, 
though I am sure my little girl will agree,  

245
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:37,200
we must put the question to her. You go on; I'll 
go back to the farm. If it's yes, there'll be no  

246
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,840
need for you to come back... She'll need some time 
to get used to the idea! But so you can be sure,  

247
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,200
I'll open the window in the front bedroom. 
You'll be able to see it from the back here.'

248
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,200
And with these words he returned to the house.

249
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,760
Charles tied his horse to a tree. He hurried 
back to take up his position, and waited.  

250
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,960
Half an hour went by, then nineteen more 
minutes, which he timed by his watch. Suddenly  

251
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,880
something banged against the wall. The 
window was open. She had accepted him!

252
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,160
Next day, by nine o'clock, he was at the farm.  

253
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,880
Emma blushed when he came in, 
but tried to laugh a little, too.  

254
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,880
Pere Rouault took his son-in-law in his arms. Then 
they began to talk about the arrangements. They  

255
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,160
had plenty of time before them, since the wedding 
could not take place until at least twelve months  

256
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,200
after the death of Charles's first wife, and 
that meant the spring of the following year.

257
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:54,640
The wedding dinner was a grand affair. Forty-three 
people sat down at the table and remained there  

258
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:02,000
for sixteen hours, and the party which followed 
went on for several days. For most of the guests  

259
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,080
it was a wedding to remember. The only 
person who did not enter the spirit of things  

260
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,240
seemed to be Madame Bovary senior, who sat through 
the whole event with a sour look on her face.  

261
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,720
No one had asked her about the bride's dress, or 
the arrangements for the party. She went to bed  

262
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,920
early. Her husband, however, did not follow 
her, but sent into Saint-Victor for cigars.  

263
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,480
He sat with the men and smoked until the morning, 
drinking and laughing until the sun rose.

264
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,880
On the day of the wedding, Charles had not been a 
great success; he was neither a confident speaker  

265
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:53,200
nor a great teller of jokes. Next day, however, 
he seemed a different man. While Emma did not  

266
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:00,240
give the smallest idea of what she thought about 
it all, Charles was completely changed. He called  

267
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,040
her his wife, his dear, kept asking where she 
was, looked for her everywhere and frequently  

268
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,240
took her out into the yard, where he was seen 
among the trees with his arm round her waist.

269
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,000
Two days after the wedding, 
the newly married couple left.  

270
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,840
Charles could not be away 
from his practice any longer.  

271
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:28,080
Monsieur Rouault sent them home in his carriage, 
and went with them himself as far as Vassonville.  

272
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:36,320
There he kissed his daughter goodbye, and started 
for home again on foot. When he had gone about  

273
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,040
a hundred metres he stopped and looked back 
at the carriage disappearing down the road.  

274
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,680
Then he thought of his own wedding. Like 
Charles, he, too, had been happy when he  

275
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:54,240
took his wife from her father's house, back to his 
own. She had ridden behind him through the snow;  

276
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:01,040
it was near Christmas and the country all white. 
One of her arms held on to him, and over the other  

277
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:08,080
she carried her basket. When he turned his head 
he saw close by him, just above his shoulder, her  

278
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:15,520
little smiling face. To warm her fingers she had 
pushed them, from time to time, inside his jacket.  

279
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,600
How far away it seemed now. He looked back again,  

280
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:28,480
and there was nothing to be seen along the 
road. He felt as sad as an empty house.

281
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,840
Monsieur and Madame Charles arrived 
at Tostes at about six o'clock.  

282
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,480
The neighbours came to their windows to 
take a look at the doctor's new wife.  

283
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,400
The old servant came to meet them and made 
excuses for the dinner not being ready,  

284
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:53,840
and suggested that, for the moment, Madame 
should come in and look around the house.
 
 
 

285
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,440
CHAPTER FOUR

286
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,280
Two Worlds

287
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,480
The front of the house looked straight on to 
the street. Hanging up behind the front door  

288
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,880
were the doctor's coat, a belt, a black leather 
cap and, on the floor in the corner, a pair of  

289
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,280
boots covered with dried mud. To the right was 
the sitting room, where meals were also eaten.  

290
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,520
White cotton curtains with a red 
border were hung along the windows,  

291
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:30,080
and above the fireplace there was a splendid clock 
and a head of Hippocrates. On the other side of  

292
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,320
the passage was Charles's consulting room, a 
little box of a place about two metres wide  

293
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,000
with a table, three ordinary chairs 
and one armchair. A set of books,  

294
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,640
the Dictionary of Medical Science, took up 
almost all the six shelves of the bookcase;  

295
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,920
they had been owned by many earlier doctors in 
Tostes, but never read. The smell of cooking  

296
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,720
would come in through the thin wall during 
consultations, and anyone in the kitchen could  

297
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,840
hear the patients coughing and talking to the 
doctor as clearly as if they were in the room.

298
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,960
The long, narrow garden ran down to the fields.  

299
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:16,320
Fruit trees grew along the stone walls and four 
flower beds, planted with weak-looking roses,  

300
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,000
were set around a square area which was 
used for vegetables. At the far end,  

301
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,360
under some low trees, there was a small white 
statue of a priest reading a prayer book.

302
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,080
Emma went up to see the bedrooms. There was 
no furniture in the first one but the second,  

303
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:43,840
their bedroom, contained their new bed with its 
red curtains. There was a box made of seashells on  

304
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:51,200
a chest of drawers and on the desk, by the window, 
stood a glass bottle with a bunch of dried flowers  

305
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,480
tied with white ribbon. They were the 
flowers from his first wife's wedding.  

306
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,160
Charles saw her looking at them, and took them 
out of the room. Sitting in an armchair, while her  

307
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:10,000
maid unpacked her things, Emma thought about her 
own wedding flowers, lying in one of the boxes,  

308
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,840
and she wondered what would 
happen to them if she died young.

309
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,360
Charles was a happy man now. In bed in the 
morning, with her head on the pillow beside him,  

310
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,840
he would look at the sunlight on her cheek 
and at her beautiful eyes when she woke.  

311
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,640
He could lose himself in those eyes, looking 
into them until he saw a tiny picture of himself,  

312
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:41,520
his nightcap on his head and the collar of his 
shirt open. As soon as he was up and dressed, she  

313
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,520
would go to the window to see him start his day. 
Down in the street below, Charles would prepare to  

314
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:54,160
get on to his horse while she went on talking to 
him from above. Sometimes she might find a feather  

315
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,520
and send it floating through the air to be caught 
in the long hair on his old white horse's neck.  

316
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,120
As he rode off, Charles would blow her 
a kiss and she would wave back to him.

317
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,800
It was the first time in his life 
that he had tasted such happiness.  

318
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,920
He had been lonely and friendless at 
school and when he was studying medicine.  

319
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,800
And then he had had fourteen months 
of married life with the widow,  

320
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:27,840
whose feet, in bed, were like lumps of ice. 
But now this lovely woman was his for life!

321
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,840
Before she married, Emma too had thought she was 
in love, but the happiness that should have come  

322
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:43,600
from love was somehow missing. It seemed to 
her that she must have made a mistake, must  

323
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,840
have misunderstood things in one way or another. 
And as she stood by her bedroom window, morning  

324
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:57,040
after morning, Emma tried hard to understand 
what, exactly, the words joy, love, desire  

325
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:05,840
meant. They had always seemed so beautiful to her 
in books, but what did they mean in real life?

326
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,560
Novels had always seemed more real 
to her than the life she had to live.  

327
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,560
When she was at her convent school, a teacher 
sometimes secretly lent such books to the  

328
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:23,520
older girls. They were all about love, lovers, 
beautiful girls, ladies in danger, horses ridden  

329
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,080
till they dropped dead, dark forests, tears 
and kisses, and gentlemen as brave as lions.  

330
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,880
When she was fifteen, Emma read the works of 
Walter Scott for the first time and found she  

331
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:43,920
was happier in this imagined past than her rather 
boring present; the characters she read about in  

332
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,280
these books were much more interesting than 
the teachers and students she saw around her.

333
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,600
She had felt a thrill each time she blew back 
the thin paper which protected the pictures.  

334
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:03,120
She saw young men holding young women in white 
dresses in their arms, or English ladies with  

335
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:09,920
golden hair, who looked at you with big, bright 
eyes. In her reading she was able to listen to the  

336
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:17,600
sound of heavenly music and of falling leaves. 
Later, after her mother died, she even fell in  

337
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,880
love with the church and thought of staying in 
the convent, of never going out into the world.  

338
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,160
But in her last year of school, she 
began to lose her interest in religion.  

339
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,120
When her father took her away, her 
teachers were not sorry to see her go.  

340
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
She had, they thought, stopped showing 
any respect for their community.

341
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,280
On her return home, Emma tried to find an 
interest in managing her father's house,  

342
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,320
but she soon grew tired of the country 
and wished herself back in her convent.  

343
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,440
When Charles came to Les 
Bertaux for the first time,  

344
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,440
she thought of herself as a disappointed woman, 
one for whom life had nothing new to offer,  

345
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:09,040
either in knowledge or experience. Maybe her wish 
for a change - possibly, too, the unrest caused by  

346
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,640
the presence of an unknown man - had been enough 
to make her believe that she was at last in love.  

347
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:22,000
But now she could not believe that her present 
state was the happiness she had dreamed about.

348
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,400
Nevertheless, she sometimes thought that these 
were, in fact, the happiest days of her life.  

349
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,560
Of course, it would have been so much better if 
they could have gone far away to lands whose names  

350
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,880
fall like music on the ear, where the weddings of 
lovers are followed by mornings of soft delight  

351
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,120
and where, when the sun goes down, you breathe, 
sitting beside the sea, the sweet perfume of  

352
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:55,920
the lemon trees. Why did her bedroom window not 
look out on to the Swiss or Scottish mountains?  

353
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,280
Why did her husband not stand 
beside her in a black silk jacket,  

354
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,520
the wind blowing his long hair 
back from his pale, white forehead?

355
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:13,440
But Charles could not read these thoughts, and 
was not able to share her dreams, and as their  

356
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,600
lives became closer Emma, in fact, began to have 
a secret feeling of distance from her husband.  

357
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,200
Charles's conversation was uninteresting to her. 
He told her that when he lived in Rouen he never  

358
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:34,080
had the smallest desire to go to the theatre. He 
could not swim, he had no idea of how to use a  

359
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:41,760
sword, he could not fire a gun. He knew nothing, 
and he wanted nothing. He thought she was happy,  

360
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,560
and his heavy, comfortable 
happiness had begun to annoy her.

361
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,400
A few weeks after they came to Tostes, one of 
Charles's patients presented Madame with a little  

362
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,560
Italian hunting dog. She took it with her for 
walks, because she used to go out sometimes just  

363
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,840
to get a few moments to herself and to enjoy 
a change from the garden and the dusty road.

364
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,640
She would go as far as the woods near Banneville, 
along by the empty summer house at the end of the  

365
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:20,400
wall, towards the open country. There, at the side 
of the lake, the plants grew higher than a man and  

366
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:27,280
had leaves as sharp as knives. Sitting at the edge 
of the wood among the pink and blue wild flowers,  

367
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,920
her thoughts would wander here and there, 
like her dog, which ran from one place to the  

368
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,840
next chasing the birds and insects. But in the 
same way that her dog always came back to her,  

369
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:45,840
she always came back to the same 
question: 'My God, why did I marry him?'

370
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:54,000
She would then call Djali (the name she had given 
her dog) to come to her and, stroking her long,  

371
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,480
graceful head, would say, 'Come, kiss your 
mistress; you have no worries, have you?'

372
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,440
Then she would look into the 
creature's beautiful, sad eyes,  

373
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,400
and a feeling of tenderness would come over her.  

374
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:15,440
Pretending the animal was herself, she would talk 
to her aloud as if she were comforting someone.

375
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,000
Towards the end of September, however, an 
extraordinary event happened in her life:  

376
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:29,840
she was invited to La Vaubyessard, the home of 
the Marquis d'Andervilliers. The Marquis, who  

377
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,360
had been a Minister in the national government, 
wanted to get back into politics, and he was now  

378
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:41,760
doing his best to make himself popular. During the 
winter months he had given firewood to the poor,  

379
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,680
and he was always the first to demand new roads 
for his district. During the summer, he had had  

380
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,200
a painful mouth infection, which Charles had 
managed to cure before it became really serious.  

381
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,520
The servant who was sent to Tostes to pay for 
the treatment told his master, when he got back,  

382
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,960
that he had seen some splendid cherries in 
the doctor's little garden. Cherries did not  

383
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,040
grow well at La Vaubyessard, and the Marquis 
asked Bovary to let him have a few baskets.  

384
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,240
He then decided to come in person to thank 
the doctor, saw Emma, and noted that she  

385
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,920
had a pretty figure and good manners. After 
this, the Marquis decided that he would not  

386
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,200
harm his chances in the coming vote if he sent 
the young people an invitation to his house.

387
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:36,720
And so, one Wednesday at three o'clock, Monsieur 
and Madame Bovary set off in their carriage to  

388
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:44,800
La Vaubyessard, with a big travelling bag tied on 
behind, and a hatbox fixed in front. They arrived  

389
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,600
when it was getting dark, just as the lamps were 
being lit in the park to guide the carriages.  

390
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,960
The Chateau la Vaubyessard, a large building in 
sixteenth-century style, stood in the centre of  

391
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:04,000
parkland. A stream flowed between tall trees 
and beneath a bridge, and through the evening  

392
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,520
mist they could see cottages and farm buildings. 
Charles stopped the carriage at the foot of the  

393
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,600
steps leading up to the front door, and two 
servants came down to take their bags. Then  

394
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:21,440
the Marquis came forward and, offering his arm to 
the doctor's lady, walked with her into the hall.

395
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:30,080
Under the high ceiling, their voices and footsteps 
sounded as if they were in a church. As she passed  

396
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,600
through on her way to the main room, Emma saw 
large, dark paintings of the Marquis's relatives,  

397
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,360
some in the clothes of the royal court, others 
in the uniforms of army or navy officers.  

398
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,800
When the Marquis opened the door 
for them, one of the ladies rose  

399
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,120
(it was the Marquise herself) and came forward 
to welcome Emma. She made her sit down beside  

400
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,240
her on a low chair, and began to chat with 
her, as if she had known her for a long time.

401
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:05,440
At seven o'clock dinner was served. The men 
were seated at the first table, in the hall,  

402
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,000
the ladies at the second, in the dining 
room, with the Marquis and the Marquise.  

403
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,760
At the long dining tables, the glasses were filled 
with iced champagne. Emma felt a thrill go through  

404
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,920
her as she tasted the coldness of it in her mouth. 
She had never seen some of the fruit that they had  

405
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,840
on the table, and even the sugar seemed whiter 
here, and more finely powdered, than elsewhere.

406
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:37,520
After dinner, there was dancing. More guests 
were arriving and the room filled with people.  

407
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,760
Emma sat down near the door and watched the 
men talking and smoking cigars in small groups  

408
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,880
in their black and white evening dress, as the 
servants moved among them carrying drinks and  

409
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,680
more small, delicate things to eat. All along 
the rows of seated women she could see smiles  

410
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,680
half-hidden, half-revealed, by the flowers 
the ladies held; everywhere there was silk,  

411
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,760
the flash of jewels and gold, white arms, 
and hair piled high on elegant heads.

412
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,720
Emma's heart beat faster when, her partner holding 
her by the tips of her fingers, she took her  

413
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:21,360
place in line and stood waiting for the dance to 
begin. But her nervousness soon disappeared and,  

414
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:28,720
moving to the music, she flew on as light as a 
bird. The memories of her past life, which until  

415
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,160
then had always been so clear, disappeared 
so completely in the magic of the moment  

416
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:41,360
that she could hardly persuade herself they were 
not a dream. There she was. No doubt about that!

417
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:48,720
During a break in the dancing supper was 
served, and again the wine flowed freely,  

418
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,160
accompanied by sea-food soup, sweet 
puddings and all kinds of cold meats.  

419
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,040
Now people with longer journeys 
began to get into their carriages  

420
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,160
and drive off one after another. Charles was 
half-asleep with his back against a door.  

421
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,000
But not everyone was ready to leave, and it was 
at three in the morning when the last dance began.

422
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,040
Only the guests who were staying the 
night at the chateau were still there.  

423
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:22,480
One of these, a Viscount whose evening dress 
fitted him like a glove, came a second time to  

424
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,720
invite Madame Bovary to dance. They began 
slowly, and then increased their speed.  

425
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,400
They turned, and everything around them turned 
- the lamps, the furniture and the floor.  

426
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,840
As they swung past the doors, Emma's dress blew 
up in the air. The Viscount looked down at her,  

427
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:48,800
she raised her eyes to his; for a moment she lost 
her breath and stopped. Then off they went again,  

428
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,480
quicker than ever, racing down to the high windows 
at the far end of the room, where she nearly fell  

429
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,880
and, for a moment, rested her head on his chest. 
And then, still turning, but more gently now,  

430
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,360
he took her to her seat. She leaned back against 
the wall and covered her eyes with her hands.  

431
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,080
Then there was a little more conversation and,  

432
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:18,000
after saying goodnight (or good 
morning), the guests went off to bed.

433
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,120
Charles dragged himself upstairs on 
heavy legs. But Emma did not want to  

434
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:29,360
sleep. She opened the window and sat with 
her head in her hand. The night was dark.  

435
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,960
A few drops of rain were falling. She breathed in 
the damp wind that blew cool against her eyelids.  

436
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,880
The dance music was still playing in her ears,  

437
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,840
and she tried to keep awake in order to keep 
the dream alive for as long as she could.  

438
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,680
As she stood there, the sun began to rise 
beyond the trees and she shivered with cold.  

439
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,520
She undressed and got down between the 
sheets, close up to Charles, who was asleep.

440
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:04,000
There were twelve or fifteen of them at 
breakfast, which, to Charles's surprise,  

441
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,400
was all over in ten minutes. After that, a small 
group went with Mademoiselle d'Andervilliers for  

442
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:16,880
a walk through the park, and then, to amuse the 
lady, the Marquis took Emma to see his stables,  

443
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,400
while Charles went to ask one of the 
men to bring his horse and carriage.

444
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,040
When Emma returned, the Bovarys said 
their goodbyes to the Marquis and Marquise  

445
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:34,320
and turned their horse's head towards Tostes 
and home. Emma sat in silence. Their bags  

446
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,000
banged against the back of the carriage as 
they made their way down the rough road.  

447
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,160
They had reached the high ground at 
Thibourville when suddenly a group of gentlemen,  

448
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:50,720
laughing and smoking cigars, rode past them. Emma 
thought she recognized the Viscount who had danced  

449
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,400
with her last night. She turned round to have 
another look, but they were already too far away.

450
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,120
A little later, they had to stop to 
make a small repair to the carriage.  

451
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:08,080
When he had finished, Charles noticed something 
lying on the ground between his horse's legs. He  

452
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:14,400
bent down and picked up a beautifully-made green 
silk cigar-case with two cigars still inside it.

453
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,000
'They'll be good this evening after dinner.'

454
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,200
He put the case in his 
pocket and started the horse.

455
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,320
When they got home,  

456
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:31,600
the evening meal was not ready. Madame became 
angry and the maid, Nastasie, replied rudely.

457
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,920
'You can leave,' said Emma. 
'You are finished here!'

458
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,480
So all they had for dinner was onion soup with 
a small piece of meat and some vegetables.

459
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,800
'How nice it is to be back 
home again!' said Charles,  

460
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,000
cheerfully rubbing his hands 
as he sat down opposite Emma.

461
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:57,200
They could hear Nastasie weeping as they ate. 
Charles was rather fond of the poor girl,  

462
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,200
who had kept him company after his first 
wife died, when he had nothing to do.  

463
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,960
She had been his first patient, the first 
person he ever got to know in Tostes.

464
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,520
'Have you really told her 
to leave?' he said at last.

465
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,280
'Yes. Why not?' she replied.

466
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,000
After supper, they went into the 
kitchen to warm themselves while  

467
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,240
the bedroom was being prepared. Charles 
began to smoke. He pushed out his lips,  

468
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,040
spat repeatedly, and pulled his head back every 
time he breathed in the smoke from the cigar.

469
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,840
'You'll make yourself ill!' she said.

470
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,880
He put the cigar down, and went 
to get himself a drink of water.  

471
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,160
Quick as lightning, Emma picked up the cigar-case 
and threw it into the back of the cupboard.

472
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:52,560
Time went so slowly the next day! Emma 
walked around her little garden, up and down,  

473
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,960
up and down, stopping to look at 
the flower-beds, at the fruit trees;  

474
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,800
looking at all these familiar things, things that 
she knew so well but which now seemed so strange.  

475
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:11,600
How far away the chateau seemed already! Her 
journey to La Vaubyessard had changed her life,  

476
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,800
but left it feeling empty. 
However, she accepted her fate.  

477
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,720
She folded up her beautiful dress and laid 
it carefully away in the chest of drawers,  

478
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:29,840
with her dancing shoes. She had now known wealth 
and luxury, and life would never be the same.

479
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:37,920
The memory of this visit to the chateau became 
part of her life. Each Wednesday she would sigh as  

480
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:47,760
she awoke and say to herself, 'A week ago today... 
a fortnight ago... three weeks ago, I was there!'  

481
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:55,440
But little by little the faces of the people 
became faint in her memory, and she forgot the  

482
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:02,000
tunes she had danced to. The servants' clothes, 
the look of the rooms came back less clearly to  

483
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:11,840
her vision. Some of the details faded away, 
but the empty space in her heart remained.
 
 
 

484
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,440
CHAPTER FIVE

485
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:14,960
Moving Home

486
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,000
Often, when Charles was out of the house, 
Emma would go to the cupboard and take  

487
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,920
out the green silk cigar-case she had hidden 
there. It must have belonged to the Viscount.  

488
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,000
Perhaps it was a present from a lady friend in 
Paris, made with love and care in every stitch.  

489
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:42,720
Paris! What sort of a place was it? 'Paris!' - 
she said the name under her breath, because she  

490
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,400
loved the sound of it. It was like the great 
bell in an old church; the word seemed to add  

491
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,320
a golden light to everything around it - even to 
the labels of her little pots of cheap make-up.

492
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,400
She bought a guidebook to Paris and, with 
her fingertip on the map, she would make  

493
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:07,120
little imaginary journeys around the capital. She 
pretended she was walking along the wide streets,  

494
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:14,400
looking in wonder at the great houses. At last, 
growing tired, she would let her eyes close,  

495
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,480
and then in the darkness she dreamed 
she saw the flame of the street lamps,  

496
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,400
and the steps of the carriages being 
let down at the entrance to the theatre.

497
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,360
She buried herself in women's magazines,  

498
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,440
reading every word about opera and 
fashion and the life of the rich.  

499
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,360
She read the latest novels - even bringing 
her book with her to the table and turning  

500
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:44,320
the pages while Charles ate and talked. And as she 
read, the memory of the Viscount came back to her  

501
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,720
and her dreams became more important, more real 
to her than her life as a country doctor's wife.

502
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,680
But she tried to improve things in her house. 
She taught her maid to hand a glass of water  

503
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:05,840
held in a white cloth, to knock before entering a 
room, to dress her mistress. In the daytime, Emma  

504
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:12,640
wore a long dress with a silk belt and little red 
silk shoes. She had bought herself a writing-case,  

505
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:19,760
a pen-holder and some envelopes, although she had 
no one to write to. She thought she would like to  

506
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:27,520
travel, or to go back to her school. She wanted 
to die - and she wanted to go and live in Paris.

507
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:36,160
And Charles rode from farm to farm on his old 
horse. He ate breakfast in farmhouse kitchens,  

508
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,520
visited sick people in their dirty 
beds, got blood on his hands and face  

509
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:48,880
and listened to the last words of the dying. But 
every night he came home to a fire, a good dinner,  

510
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:54,080
a comfortable chair, and a pretty wife who 
had so many little ways of giving pleasure.  

511
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:01,440
It might be paper shades for the candles, a new 
ribbon for her dress or an extraordinary name  

512
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,400
for a very ordinary dish, which Charles 
ate happily, enjoying every bit of it.  

513
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,680
Everything Emma did added something to the 
pleasure of his senses and of his home.  

514
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,560
It was like finding gold-dust in the 
middle of the narrow pathway of his life.

515
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,560
He felt well, and looked well. People liked 
him. He talked to their children, did not drink,  

516
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:30,720
could be trusted and was especially good with the 
chest complaints that were so common among country  

517
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:37,120
people. A major reason for Charles's success was 
that he was so afraid of killing his patients  

518
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:42,960
that he never gave them anything more than simple 
medicines - but he was not frightened of surgery,  

519
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,880
and had a strong wrist when he pulled teeth. The 
people of the region were happy with their doctor.

520
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:56,880
Charles did have some ambitions. He tried to 
read a professional journal after dinner, but  

521
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,840
the warmth of the room and the good meal he had 
eaten would send him to sleep after five minutes.  

522
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:10,240
And there he sat, his head resting on his two 
hands and his long hair hanging over his face.  

523
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,720
Emma looked at him and asked herself 
why she had not got one of those strong,  

524
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:20,000
silent men for a husband, men who sit up at 
night with their books, and become famous,  

525
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,240
if not rich. She would have liked the name 
of Bovary, which was hers now, to be famous,  

526
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,600
to be seen in the bookshops, 
talked about in the papers,  

527
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:36,160
known all over France. But Charles did not have 
that kind of ambition, and sometimes she felt  

528
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:44,800
like hitting him. 'What a man! What a poor kind 
of man!' she said to herself, biting her lips.

529
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,960
So as time went on, Emma felt herself less 
and less able to put up with her husband.  

530
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:00,000
He was growing more unpleasant as he got older. He 
sucked his teeth after eating, and made a horrible  

531
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,920
noise at every mouthful of soup he swallowed. 
As he was beginning to put on weight, his eyes,  

532
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:12,160
which were already small, looked as if they would 
start to disappear into his increasingly fat face.

533
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,120
Deep down in her heart, she was waiting 
for something to happen. She did not know  

534
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:25,120
what it would be, what the wind would blow 
to her. But every morning when she awoke,  

535
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:31,360
she hoped it would come that day. She listened 
to every sound, watched every new face in the  

536
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:37,920
street outside her house for a sign, and could 
not understand why nothing happened. And then  

537
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,920
at sunset, sadder than ever, she 
would long for the next day to come.

538
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:54,080
The spring came again. With the first touch of 
heat, when the apple trees were in flower, she  

539
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:01,040
began to have attacks of dizziness. And when July 
came, she counted on her fingers how many weeks  

540
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:06,160
it would be to October, thinking that perhaps 
the Marquis d'Andervilliers would be giving  

541
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:13,520
another dance at La Vaubyessard. But September 
came and went, and no one called or wrote.

542
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:21,040
After this disappointment there was the same 
emptiness in her heart, and the empty days began  

543
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:28,160
again as before. The future was like a corridor 
in which there was no light, and at the end of it  

544
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:36,080
only a closed door. She gave up her music. What 
was the use of playing? Who was there to hear?  

545
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:43,840
She stopped her drawing. What was the good, what 
was the good of it all? Even sewing bored her.

546
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,840
'There's nothing left to read,' she 
said to herself. And there she sat,  

547
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,520
staring at the falling rain.

548
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:59,840
Was this hopeless life going to last for ever? Was 
there no escape? She knew she was just as good as  

549
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:06,320
the luckier ones. At La Vaubyessard she had seen 
great ladies who were not as pretty or intelligent  

550
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:14,160
as her; why was she so unlucky? She would lean 
her head against the wall and weep, wanting so  

551
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:20,080
much for a life of excitement, pleasures, all the 
delights which must be out there in the world,  

552
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:27,280
but which were not hers. There were days when she 
would talk and talk; then the excitement would die  

553
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:34,240
away, and she would fall back into a kind of dream 
world and sit without moving or saying a word.

554
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:42,160
As she was always saying how she hated Tostes, 
Charles thought her illness must be caused by  

555
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:49,360
the place itself. The idea grew on him, and he 
began seriously to think of going elsewhere.  

556
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,840
Then she started drinking vinegar 
to make herself lose weight,  

557
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,160
coughed a little dry cough 
and could not touch her food.

558
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:05,600
It was hard for Charles to leave Tostes. He had 
been there for four years and was building a  

559
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:13,840
good practice. However, what must be must be. 
He took her to Rouen to see another doctor.  

560
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:20,560
The doctor said it was a case of nerves. What she 
needed was a change. So Charles looked around all  

561
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:26,640
over the place, and at last heard of a busy little 
market town called Yonville-l'Abbaye, somewhere in  

562
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:32,240
the Neufchatel area, where the doctor had recently 
left town and no replacement had been found.  

563
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:39,440
He wrote to the local pharmacist asking him to let 
him know how many people there were in the place,  

564
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,920
what sort of competition there was, and 
how much a year the other man used to make.  

565
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,840
The answers were satisfactory, and Charles 
decided he would make a move in the spring  

566
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,240
if Emma's health had not improved.

567
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,320
One day, when she was emptying a 
drawer in preparation for the move,  

568
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:05,520
Emma felt something sharp against her finger. It 
was the piece of wire around her wedding flowers,  

569
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:11,760
faded and dusty now, and the ribbon eaten 
by insects. She threw them on the fire,  

570
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,840
where they burned like a handful of dry grass 
and then lay like a red bush in the fireplace.  

571
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:24,800
As she watched them burn, the paper berries 
burst, the wire bent and twisted, and the  

572
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:31,840
paper flowers were held in the hot air like black 
insects until, at last, they flew up the chimney.

573
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,760
In March, when they left Tostes, 
Madame Bovary was pregnant.
 
 
 

574
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,160
CHAPTER SIX

575
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,760
Yonville

576
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,400
Yonville-l'Abbaye is a market town 
about twenty-six kilometres from Rouen,  

577
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,720
between the Abbeville and Beauvais roads.  

578
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,120
It is on the borders of Normandy, Picardy and 
the Ile-de-France, the sort of place where the  

579
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:05,360
language has no accent and the landscape no 
character. Here they make the worst cheese in  

580
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:11,440
the whole district, and farming is expensive 
because the sandy, stony soil is so poor.

581
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:19,520
Until 1835 there was no good road to Yonville, 
and although a new one has been built, nothing has  

582
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:26,240
really changed there for a hundred years. Walking 
into the town you still pass small farmhouses set  

583
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:31,200
in their own gardens, and see that the fields 
stretch almost into the centre of the town.  

584
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,000
The market, with its red roof supported by twenty 
or more wooden posts, takes up half of the town  

585
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,560
square. The Town Hall is a large, important 
looking building, but what really catches  

586
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:50,640
the eye is the pharmacy of Monsieur Homais just 
opposite the town's one hotel, the Lion d'Or.

587
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:57,520
The pharmacy is especially attractive at night 
when the lamps are lit and the big red and green  

588
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:02,800
glass bottles in the window send long beams 
of coloured light far out along the ground.  

589
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:09,120
From top to bottom, the building is covered with 
advertisements for medicines and mineral water,  

590
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:15,760
and the shop-sign which goes right across the 
front carries in golden letters the words 'Homais,  

591
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:22,560
Pharmacist'. At the far end of the shop, the word 
'Laboratory' appears over a glass door on which,  

592
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:27,360
halfway up, the name 'Homais' is 
repeated in more gold letters on black.

593
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,680
And that is all there is worth seeing in Yonville.  

594
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:37,840
The one and only street, with a shop or two on 
either side of it, stops at the bend in the road.  

595
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,680
If you turn to your right and follow the path at 
the foot of the hill, you come to the cemetery.

596
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,320
The night the Bovarys arrived in Yonville, 
Madame Lefrancois, who ran the inn,  

597
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:55,200
was so busy that the sweat ran down her face 
as she rushed around among her pots and pans.  

598
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,480
Tomorrow was market day and she still 
had the meat to cook, the soup to make  

599
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,280
and the coffee to get ready. Then there 
was the meal for her regular customers,  

600
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:10,560
as well as for the new doctor and his wife and 
maid - whose coach was now half an hour late.

601
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,280
Shouts of laughter came from the bar, where 
three workmen were calling for more wine  

602
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:24,000
and the wood fire was burning. A man in soft 
green leather shoes, a smoking cap on his head,  

603
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,240
was standing warming his back by the fire. He had 
a look of complete self-satisfaction on his face,  

604
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:36,720
and he appeared to be as carefree as the small 
bird in the cage which hung from the ceiling. It  

605
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,440
was the pharmacist, waiting for the evening 
meal which he regularly ate at the hotel.

606
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:47,760
He did not have to wait too long. 
Soon, Madame Lefrancois heard the  

607
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,240
sound of wheels and the metal shoes 
of a tired horse on the road outside.

608
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:59,600
As soon as the coach stopped, other villagers 
came to the inn, and all began to speak at once,  

609
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,360
asking for news, explanations and 
packages they had been waiting for.  

610
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:08,960
As he gave out his parcels, Hivert, 
the coachman, told them they had been  

611
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,920
delayed because Madame Bovary's little 
dog had run away and had not been found.

612
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:21,120
Emma had, in fact, been crying for the 
last hour. She said it was Charles's fault.  

613
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,960
Monsieur Lheureux, who was travelling inside the 
coach and who had the fabric shop in the village,  

614
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,200
had done his best to make her happier 
by telling her of several cases in which  

615
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,640
dogs had come back to their masters after 
years of separation. There was a story,  

616
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:41,360
he said, of a dog that found its way back 
to Paris all the way from Constantinople!

617
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:50,400
Dog or no dog, they had arrived at their new home, 
and had to leave the coach. Emma got out first,  

618
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:57,280
then Felicite, her maid, and then Monsieur 
Lheureux. They had to wake Charles up;  

619
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,400
he had fallen asleep in his 
corner as soon as it grew dark.

620
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:07,200
Homais introduced himself, offered his services 
to Madame and his respects to Monsieur,  

621
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,480
told them he was charmed to have 
been able to do them a service,  

622
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,960
adding with a smile that he had invited himself 
to dinner as his wife was away from home.

623
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,560
As soon as she was in the kitchen, 
Madame Bovary went over to the fire.  

624
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:26,160
With the tips of two fingers she took hold of 
her dress at the knee and, raising it above  

625
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:34,160
her ankles, stretched out a foot to the flames - a 
little foot in a black boot. The fire lit her from  

626
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:40,240
top to toe, its red light making her dress shine 
and showing the perfect white skin of her face.  

627
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:47,200
On the other side of the fireplace, a 
fair-haired young man watched her in silence.

628
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:55,760
Monsieur Leon Dupuis, clerk to the town's only 
lawyer, also ate regularly at the Lion d'Or.  

629
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,560
As he found life in Yonville 
almost impossibly boring,  

630
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:04,400
he would often delay his meal in the hope 
that a traveller would arrive at the inn  

631
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,680
with whom he could enjoy a conversation 
in the evening. It was therefore with some  

632
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,920
pleasure that he accepted the suggestion 
that he should sit down with the Bovarys.

633
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:21,840
At the table, Homais asked permission to 
keep on his cap, for fear of catching cold.

634
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:27,520
'Madame must be a little tired,' he said, turning 
to Emma. 'It is not a comfortable journey.'

635
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:36,080
'Very true,' she answered, 'but I love 
moving around. I hate staying in one place.'

636
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:40,400
'Oh, I agree. Staying in one place 
is horrible!' said the clerk.

637
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,840
'But if you were like me,' said Charles, 
'and always had to be on your horse...'

638
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:52,800
And so the meal continued. Charles spent most 
of his time discussing medical matters with  

639
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:58,000
Monsieur Homais, while Leon told Madame Bovary 
about the attractions of the neighbourhood.  

640
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:04,160
They quickly discovered that they 
shared the same romantic tastes.

641
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:10,320
'I think there's nothing so beautiful as a sunset, 
especially by the sea!' said Madame Bovary.

642
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,880
'Oh, I love the sea!' Monsieur Leon replied.

643
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,480
'And doesn't it seem to you, 
somehow, that you think more freely,  

644
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,720
and that it raises your soul and makes you 
think of the endless nature of things?'

645
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,360
'It's just the same where there 
are mountains,' Leon went on.

646
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:37,200
So they continued talking of Switzerland and 
Italy, which they had never visited, and music,  

647
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,720
which neither of them could play,  

648
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,760
and reading - the one thing that 
both of them did enthusiastically.

649
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:49,120
'What can be better than sitting by 
the fire in the evening with a book,  

650
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:53,280
when the lamp is lit and the wind 
beats against the window?' said Leon.

651
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,840
'That's just what I think,' she replied, 
looking at him with her big, dark eyes.

652
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:08,400
'You forget everything,' he went on. 'The 
hours slip by. Sitting still in your armchair,  

653
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,160
you can wander in strange places and 
imagine they are there before your eyes.'

654
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,240
'Oh yes, that's true!' she said.

655
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,280
They had been at the table for 
two and a half hours by now,  

656
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:25,840
since Artemise, the servant, did not hurry as 
she brought the dishes in from the kitchen.  

657
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:32,000
Quite unconsciously, Leon had put his foot 
up on one of the bars of the chair on which  

658
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,720
Madame Bovary was sitting, moving closer 
so he could catch everything she said.  

659
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:43,360
And so, while Charles and the pharmacist went on 
with their discussion, Emma and Leon sat close  

660
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:48,720
to one another, and entered into a conversation in 
which they talked about the interests they shared:  

661
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:56,000
the Paris theatres, names of novels, the latest 
dances, the world of fashion, which neither of  

662
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,760
them knew anything about, Tostes, where she 
had lived, and Yonville, where they were now.  

663
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,520
They discussed anything and everything, 
and talked all through dinner.

664
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:14,240
When the coffee was brought in, Felicite 
went to arrange the bedroom in the new house,  

665
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,920
and the group around the dinner 
table soon afterwards rose to go.  

666
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,240
Madame Lefrancois had fallen 
asleep by the dying fire,  

667
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:28,320
while the manservant, lamp in hand, was waiting 
to show Monsieur and Madame Bovary to their house.

668
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:36,640
The house felt damp and cold after the warmth of 
the inn. The walls were new and the wooden stairs  

669
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:43,200
had no carpet. Upstairs in the bedroom, a pale 
light came in through the curtainless windows.  

670
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:49,280
The tops of some trees could just be seen, 
and beyond them, the fields in the moonlight.

671
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:56,080
This would be the fourth time Emma had slept in 
a new bedroom. The first was when she went to the  

672
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:02,480
convent, the second when she came to Tostes, 
the third at La Vaubyessard, and now this was  

673
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:07,920
the fourth. And every time, it had seemed as 
if she were entering a new stage in her life.  

674
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:14,480
She could not believe that things would look 
and be the same in different places. The most  

675
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:19,840
recent period of her life had been bad, so 
the next part would have to be better.
 
 
 

676
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,480
CHAPTER SEVEN

677
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,400
In Love

678
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:36,000
Next morning, when she awoke, Emma saw the 
clerk walking across the square. She was in her  

679
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:42,880
dressing-gown. He looked up and took off his hat. 
She gave a little nod and quickly shut the window.

680
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:50,480
All day long, Leon waited for six o'clock to 
arrive. But when he went round to the inn,  

681
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:55,440
the only person there was Monsieur Binet, the 
tax collector, already seated at the table.  

682
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:01,840
The dinner of the night before had been an 
important event for Leon. It was the first time in  

683
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:08,720
his life that he had talked to a woman for a whole 
evening. How did he manage to tell her, and in  

684
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:15,680
such brilliant language, so many things he could 
not have expressed so well before? Unfortunately,  

685
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:19,680
it did not look as if he would have the chance 
to repeat his performance for the moment.

686
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:26,480
Monsieur Homais, the pharmacist, however, was 
able to visit Madame Bovary and show what a  

687
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:32,800
good neighbour he was. He told her all about the 
shopkeepers, where to get her butter cheaply,  

688
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,240
and he helped her find a gardener. It has to 
be said, however, that he was not doing this  

689
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:44,480
out of pure kindness. Monsieur Homais had, 
a year earlier, broken the law which forbade  

690
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:50,560
the practice of medicine by all unqualified 
persons. Someone had told the authorities,  

691
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,360
and Monsieur Homais had been given a very 
severe warning by the magistrate in Rouen.  

692
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:01,040
The problem was that he still liked to give 
quick, innocent consultations in his shop,  

693
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:08,720
but the Mayor did not like him, others were 
jealous, and he was playing a dangerous game. So  

694
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:13,520
Monsieur Homais thought to himself that if he did 
things for Monsieur and Madame Bovary, Monsieur  

695
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:19,560
Bovary would be grateful, and a grateful man does 
not make complaints to the authorities in Rouen.

696
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:26,640
Every morning, Homais would come across with 
the newspaper and often, during the afternoon,  

697
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,920
he would leave his shop for a minute 
or two to chat with the new doctor.  

698
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:38,400
Charles was not a happy man; patients did not 
come. He sat for hour after hour in silence,  

699
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:44,320
or he went to sleep in his surgery or watched 
his wife sew. He even started doing some small  

700
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:48,480
jobs at home, trying to paint the bedroom 
with some paint the men had left behind.  

701
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:55,040
Money was his great worry. He had spent 
such a lot on repairs at Tostes, on his  

702
01:11:55,040 --> 01:12:01,600
wife's clothes and on moving, and most of his 
savings and Emma's money had gone in two years.

703
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,880
But Charles also had something 
pleasant to think about,  

704
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,600
as his wife was expecting a child, 
and the closer they got to the time,  

705
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:18,080
the more loving he became. It was another link 
between them, real evidence of their marriage.  

706
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:25,120
When he watched her heavier walk, when she sat 
opposite him at the table, or when she was in her  

707
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:31,040
armchair after dinner, he could not stop himself 
getting up, kissing her, stroking her face,  

708
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:39,040
calling her 'little mother'. The idea of being a 
father pleased him very much. He lacked nothing.

709
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:47,680
At first Emma was surprised by his attention; then 
all she wanted was to have the baby as soon as  

710
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:54,560
possible, so that she would know how it felt to 
be a mother. Their shortage of money meant that  

711
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:59,680
she could not buy all the things she wanted for 
the new arrival, so perhaps she did not feel as  

712
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:05,520
much love for the child she carried as she wanted 
to give. But she thought about it all the time.

713
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:12,000
She hoped it would be a boy. He should be 
strong and dark, and they would call him  

714
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,240
George. And the thought of having 
a boy somehow made her feel better.  

715
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:22,400
A man would be free, while a woman 
is always limited. She is weaker and  

716
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:27,440
economically dependent, and the habits of 
society do not permit her the same freedom.

717
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:35,840
Emma's baby was born on a Sunday morning 
at about six, just as the sun was rising.

718
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,680
'It's a girl,' said Charles.

719
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,680
She turned away her head and fainted.

720
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:50,720
Madame Homais came to the house as soon as the 
news was given to congratulate her, and so did  

721
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:57,280
Madame Lefrancois of the Lion d'Or. The pharmacist 
offered his congratulations through the half-open  

722
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:03,120
door. He then asked to see the baby and declared 
it was the most well formed he had ever seen.

723
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,960
As the doctor felt that his wife was not 
strong enough to feed the baby herself,  

724
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:15,760
the little girl was sent to a wet nurse. With 
nothing else to do in the days after the birth,  

725
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:21,840
Emma tried to think of a name for her daughter. 
First she went through names with Italian endings,  

726
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:31,040
like Clara, Louisa, Amanda. She rather liked 
old names like Galsuinde, or Yseult or Leocadie.  

727
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:36,400
Charles wanted the child to be called 
after her mother. Emma said no.

728
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,640
At last Emma remembered that at 
the Chateau de la Vaubyessard  

729
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:49,040
she had heard the Marquise call a young woman 
by the name of Berthe. That decision was made.

730
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:55,840
Four or five weeks after the birth, Emma 
felt a sudden need to see her little girl,  

731
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,880
so she set out in the direction of the wet 
nurse's house at the far end of the village.  

732
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:08,720
It was midday and the sun beat down from 
a cloudless sky. A hot wind was blowing  

733
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:13,200
and when she had gone some way, Emma began 
to feel weak from the effort of walking.  

734
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:18,240
She started to think she should return 
home or go in somewhere and sit down.

735
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:24,640
Just then, Monsieur Leon came out from 
a house close by, with some papers under  

736
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:31,840
his arm. He came up and spoke, and took her into 
the shade outside Lheureux's shop. Madame Bovary  

737
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,000
said she was on her way to see her baby, 
but that she was beginning to feel tired.

738
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:42,000
'If...' began Leon, but he 
stopped, not daring to continue.

739
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,760
'Are you very busy?' she asked.

740
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:51,840
And when the clerk said that he was 
not, she begged him to walk with her.

741
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:57,120
To reach the nurse's house they had to go along 
to the end of the street and then turn, as if  

742
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:03,120
they were going to the cemetery. They set off side 
by side, and recognized the house by an old tree  

743
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:09,920
that shaded it. It was a low, badly maintained 
house with a brown roof and small, untidy garden.

744
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:17,360
Hearing the gate open, the woman came out, 
carrying a baby at her breast. With her other hand  

745
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:22,560
she was dragging along a poor, miserable-looking 
two-year-old with spots all over his face.

746
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,920
'Come in,' she said. 'Your 
little one is in there asleep.'

747
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:35,760
She went into the dark bedroom, and showed 
Emma where the little girl was sleeping. Emma  

748
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:42,080
took the baby in her arms, wrapped up in a dirty 
blanket, and began to sing gently as she held her.

749
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:49,040
Leon walked up and down the room. It seemed 
strange to him to see this beautiful, elegantly  

750
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:55,440
dressed woman in such poor surroundings. Madame 
Bovary saw him looking and blushed bright red.  

751
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,000
He turned away, thinking he 
had perhaps seemed too curious,  

752
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,880
as she gave the baby back to the nurse. 
It had just been sick all over her collar.

753
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:11,280
Having lost enthusiasm for her baby, 
Emma again took Monsieur Leon's arm,  

754
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,840
and they left the nurse holding the child 
and waving as they went down the path.  

755
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:24,000
Emma walked quickly for some distance, 
then slowed down. As she looked around her,  

756
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:30,160
her eyes rested on the young man's shoulder and 
on his well-cut coat with its smart black collar.  

757
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:35,520
She noticed how his golden brown hair was 
smooth and carefully brushed, and that his  

758
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:40,640
fingernails were longer and much more carefully 
cared for than most fingernails in Yonville.

759
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:48,160
They went back to the village on the path beside 
the river. The stream flowed on noiselessly,  

760
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:54,640
deep and cool; dark plants moved in the water 
like long green hair, and insects walked over  

761
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:59,920
its smooth surface or waited with shining 
wings on the tall grass at the water's edge.  

762
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:07,920
All around, as far as the eye could see, the 
fields had emptied of people. It was dinner-time  

763
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:13,120
in the farms, and the only sounds that fell on 
the ears of the young woman and her companion  

764
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:19,840
were their footsteps on the path, the words they 
spoke and Emma's dress brushing against the grass.  

765
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:26,560
The garden walls were hot in the sun, and the 
wild plants that were growing between the stones  

766
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:32,720
had died. As she passed, Madame Bovary 
touched some of their dry flowers,  

767
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,720
which made them fall into yellow dust.

768
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:42,040
They were talking about some Spanish dancers who 
were going to perform at the theatre in Rouen.

769
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,560
'Will you go?' she asked.

770
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,040
'If I can,' he replied.

771
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:53,520
Was this all they had to say to one 
another? They tried to speak of ordinary,  

772
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,080
everyday things, but all the time they 
felt a deep change coming over them.  

773
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:05,840
It was like a whisper from the soul, deep down, 
stronger than the spoken word. Lost in wonder  

774
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:11,120
at this strange sweetness, they did not speak 
of it or try to explain what was happening.  

775
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,920
But both felt that there could be 
future pleasures waiting for them.

776
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:22,080
When they came to her garden, Madame 
Bovary pushed open the little gate  

777
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,800
and, running up the steps, disappeared from view.

778
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:33,520
Leon went back to his office. His boss was out. 
He looked quickly at some papers, prepared a  

779
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:40,320
pen for writing, but then put on his hat and 
went out. He went up to the edge of the woods,  

780
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:45,680
threw himself down on the ground under the 
trees and looked at the sky through his fingers.

781
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:51,760
'Oh!' he sighed. 'I am so bored!'

782
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:02,320
As soon as the weather began to turn cold, Emma 
spent her days in the sitting room. It was a long  

783
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:08,000
room with a low ceiling, and above the fireplace 
there was a picture of the sea and a large mirror.  

784
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:12,480
She pulled her chair close to the window 
so that she could watch the villagers  

785
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,080
as they went by on the pavement.

786
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,280
Twice a day, Leon passed from 
his work to the Lion d'Or.  

787
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:25,760
Emma could recognize his steps from a long 
way away. She leaned forward and listened,  

788
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:32,000
and the young man walked past, always dressed the 
same and always looking straight in front of him.  

789
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,480
In the evening, when she had dropped her piece 
of unfinished sewing on her lap and was sitting  

790
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:42,240
with her chin resting on her left hand, she would 
again notice his figure moving past the window,  

791
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,320
and then she would get up and tell 
the girl to lay the table for dinner.

792
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:54,160
Monsieur Homais would often come in while they 
were eating. Smoking cap in hand, he would come in  

793
01:20:54,160 --> 01:21:00,720
quietly, not wanting to disturb anyone, and always 
saying the same thing: 'Good evening, everybody.'  

794
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,960
Having taken his usual place at the table, 
between husband and wife, he asked the doctor  

795
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,840
about his patients, and the doctor consulted 
him about the sort of fees he ought to charge.  

796
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:18,640
Then they began to discuss the news in the paper. 
At eight o'clock the pharmacist's assistant,  

797
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,240
Justin, would come for him to 
go over and shut up the shop.

798
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:29,280
On Sundays, the Bovarys would return these 
visits and spend the evening at the pharmacist's.  

799
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:36,480
They would begin with cards - Monsieur Homais 
usually being Emma's partner. Leon would stand  

800
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:43,280
behind her and tell her what to play. Every time 
she threw a card on the table, the movement would  

801
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:49,520
pull up her dress on the right side, and her hair 
would move across her neck like soft brown silk.

802
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,320
When they had finished the cards, the pharmacist 
and the doctor would settle down to discuss  

803
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:01,920
the news of the day and drink their wine and 
Emma, changing her place, would sit with her  

804
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:09,520
elbow on the table, turning over the pages of an 
illustrated magazine. Leon sat down beside her,  

805
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,840
and they looked at the pictures together, 
waiting for each other at the bottom of the page.  

806
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:21,360
Sometimes she would ask him to read some poetry. 
And so a kind of friendship began between them.

807
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:28,320
The problem for Leon, however, was to know 
what sort of friend Madame Bovary might be.  

808
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:34,240
They gave each other small presents, 
they were happy in each other's company,  

809
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:39,040
but would there be more? He thought 
and thought about this in his lonely  

810
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:44,880
room. Should he tell her what he was 
feeling? Did he love her, or didn't he?  

811
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,160
He was torn between fear of hurting her 
and shame at his own lack of courage.  

812
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:57,280
Sometimes he would make up his mind to act, and to 
act quickly. He wrote letters - and tore them up;  

813
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:04,080
decided on a day to speak to her - and put it off. 
Sometimes he walked out of the lawyer's office  

814
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:10,720
with his mind made up. But all his courage melted 
when he found himself face to face with Emma;  

815
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:15,360
and when Charles came home and invited him 
to come with him to see a patient at a farm  

816
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:22,240
a few kilometres away, he at once accepted and, 
with a bow to Madame, left with her husband.

817
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,160
But Emma did not ask herself if she was in love.  

818
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:32,800
Love, she thought, was something that must come 
suddenly, like a great thunderstorm, blowing away  

819
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:39,280
your old life and carrying your heart and soul 
away, to heaven or to hell. She never thought  

820
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:45,360
about the way a river can rise slowly, getting 
higher day by day, until after a night of rain it  

821
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:53,680
breaks its banks and floods the land around it. In 
fact, she had no idea of the danger she was in.
 
 
 

822
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,080
CHAPTER EIGHT

823
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,840
A Dream Ends

824
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:10,000
One snowy Sunday afternoon in February, Monsieur 
and Madame Bovary, Homais and Monsieur Leon  

825
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,760
went to look at a new mill that 
was being built outside Yonville.  

826
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:21,120
Homais had brought his children, to give them a 
little exercise. The place did not interest Emma,  

827
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:26,960
and she stood away from the group, leaning on 
Leon's arm, while Homais and her husband talked  

828
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:33,200
about the technical wonders - the thick walls, 
the great machinery - they saw all around them.

829
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:40,240
Turning from the pale sunlight coming through 
the mist, she saw Charles, his cap pulled down  

830
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:48,240
over his ears, his thick lips and his stupid face. 
Even his back was annoying, a stupid back covered  

831
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:56,320
in a stupid, boring winter coat. Leon moved 
forward a step. The cold air had made him pale,  

832
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:01,120
even more beautiful than normal. The 
collar of his shirt was open a little,  

833
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:05,600
showing his white skin; the tip of his 
ear was visible under his long hair,  

834
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:11,840
and his big blue eyes, raised upwards to 
the clouds, seemed to Emma to be clearer,  

835
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:16,640
more beautiful than those mountain 
lakes in which the skies are mirrored.

836
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:24,080
Madame Bovary did not go over to her neighbours' 
that evening, and when Charles had left and she  

837
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:30,000
felt she was all alone, she lay down on the carpet 
in front of the fire and thought about Leon once  

838
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:38,000
more. She thought he was charming. She could not 
put him out of her thoughts. She remembered how he  

839
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:45,920
had stood, the things he had said, all about him. 
And she said over and over again, 'Oh, charming!  

840
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:56,160
Charming!... And in love?' she asked herself. 
'But with whom?... But it must be with me!'

841
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:02,080
The evidence was suddenly clear to 
her and her heart gave a great leap.  

842
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,840
The firelight became brighter, and she turned 
on her back and stretched out her arms.

843
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,000
After the first excitement, she then 
thought, as so many people have before,  

844
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:22,320
'Ah, why did this happen when it was too 
late? Why not before? What prevented it?'

845
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,480
It was midnight when Charles got back.  

846
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,920
She pretended she had just woken up 
and, as he made a noise undressing,  

847
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:37,280
she complained of having a headache. Then she 
asked what sort of an evening it had been.

848
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:42,720
'Monsieur Leon,' he said, 'went to bed early.'

849
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:50,080
She could not help smiling. When 
she turned over to go to sleep,  

850
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,560
her heart was filled with a new happiness.

851
01:26:54,720 --> 01:27:00,560
Next day, however, she could not settle to her 
work in the house; she was happy, but still could  

852
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:06,560
not take pleasure in the things she usually liked 
to do. So when Monsieur Lheureux, the draper,  

853
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:13,600
visited and showed her a beautiful scarf, even 
offering to let her pay later, she refused. And  

854
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:18,960
when Leon visited her in the afternoon, all 
she could do was to talk about her husband!

855
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:26,320
The same sort of thing went on for days. Her 
manner and conversation changed completely.  

856
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:30,720
She became interested in housekeeping, 
started going to church again regularly,  

857
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:37,440
and stopped the cook stealing the sugar. She even 
took her little daughter Berthe away from the wet  

858
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:44,400
nurse and showed her to all her visitors. She told 
everyone she loved children. They were such a joy  

859
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:50,560
and comfort, she said, as she kissed the child 
and held her close to her. When Charles got home,  

860
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:56,080
he would find his chair ready by the fire. His 
clothes were brushed and cleaned, the buttons  

861
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:00,960
were always on his shirts, and his shirts were 
folded carefully after they had been ironed.  

862
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,160
When Leon saw him at the fireside after 
dinner, with his hands on his stomach,  

863
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:11,440
his cheeks red from the meat and wine, 
the child crawling around on the carpet,  

864
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:15,440
and this elegant woman who would lean over 
and kiss him over the back of the chair,  

865
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:22,400
he would say to himself, 'What a fool I am 
to imagine I could make her care for me!'

866
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:32,560
And as each day passed, Emma became thinner and 
paler. She was so sad and so calm, so gentle  

867
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:38,240
and, at the same time, so distant, that you 
felt a sort of icy charm when you were with her.  

868
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,320
This charm changed the 
attitudes of her neighbours;  

869
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:46,320
they no longer saw her as the outsider 
who did not know how to behave properly.

870
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:53,280
'She's a wonderful woman,' said the pharmacist, 
and the married women of Yonville admired her for  

871
01:28:53,280 --> 01:29:00,320
her good management, the patients for her pleasant 
manners, the poor for her charity. But beneath her  

872
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:08,400
calm, Emma was in a state of desire and anger and 
hatred. Her plain, simple dress hid a heart that  

873
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:15,840
was breaking, and she could tell no one, no one! 
She was in love with Leon, but she did not want to  

874
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:21,120
see him. Her heart beat faster when she heard 
him coming, and then, when he was there, the  

875
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:27,280
excitement went away and was replaced by a feeling 
of fear and sadness. She did not know what to do.

876
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:33,520
What made it harder to bear was that Charles had 
no understanding of what she was going through,  

877
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,840
and she began to hate him for his lack of feeling.  

878
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:40,640
She would have liked Charles to beat her so 
that she could have a reason for hating him.  

879
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:46,080
She was torn between a love she could not 
admit to, and a hatred she could not show.  

880
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:54,640
And there she sat at the end of another empty 
day, broken, motionless, her face wet with tears.

881
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:01,200
'Why don't you tell the doctor about it?' said 
her maid when she came in and found her like this.

882
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:08,640
'It's only nerves,' answered Emma. 'Don't 
mention it to him. He would only worry.'

883
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:15,840
If Emma was unhappy, Leon was also 
less than pleased with his life,  

884
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:22,080
feeling he had nothing to look forward to. He 
was so tired of Yonville and its inhabitants  

885
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,440
that the sight of certain people 
and certain houses made him angry.  

886
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:32,800
And when Monsieur Homais, the pharmacist, tried to 
amuse him, he found himself disliking him too. The  

887
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,240
problem was, however, that the thought of changing 
things alarmed him as much as it excited him.

888
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,640
And the more he thought about it 
all, the more impatient he became.  

889
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:49,040
'Paris' was the word he kept saying to 
himself. Since he had to go there for his final  

890
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:55,600
examinations, why not go now? What was stopping 
him? And he began to plan a new life for himself.  

891
01:30:56,160 --> 01:31:01,600
He would live like an artist. He would take 
guitar lessons. He would wear a red coat  

892
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,560
and a blue hat; he would go to the opera 
every night and drink wine with actresses!  

893
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:12,560
The great difficulty would be to persuade 
his mother to agree - but, in fact,  

894
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:17,920
it was quite easy. His own employer had been 
telling him to take up work in another office  

895
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:22,880
and widen his experience, and his mother 
wanted Leon to qualify as soon as possible.  

896
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:29,840
Two days after he had sent his letter, she 
wrote back to him giving her permission!

897
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:36,240
When he knew he could leave, however, he 
did not hurry. Every day, for a whole month,  

898
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:41,760
boxes and parcels were delivered to his 
rooms in Yonville; and although Leon had  

899
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:46,400
soon made enough preparations - and more 
than enough - for a voyage round the world,  

900
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,600
he kept putting things off from week to week.

901
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:57,680
However, at last the time came to leave, and he 
hardly had time to say goodbye to Monsieur Bovary.  

902
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:02,960
He ran up the stairs to the sitting room, 
and as he went in Madame Bovary rose quickly.

903
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,240
'Here I am again!' said Leon.

904
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,720
'I knew you would come!'

905
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:15,200
She bit her lip hard, and could feel herself 
blush from the roots of her hair to the edge  

906
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:19,440
of her collar. She remained standing, 
leaning her shoulder against the wall.

907
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,880
'Is the doctor in?' he said.

908
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,640
'No, he's gone out.' And she 
repeated, 'He's gone out.'

909
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:30,880
Then there was silence.

910
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,640
'I would like to kiss Berthe goodbye,' he said.

911
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,840
Emma went down a few stairs and called Felicite.

912
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:44,160
He gave a long look round - 
at the walls, the shelves,  

913
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:47,600
the fireplace - as if to carry 
the memory of it away with him.

914
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:54,800
Emma returned, and the servant came in with 
Berthe. Leon kissed her several times on the neck.

915
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:59,680
'Goodbye, my poor little thing; 
goodbye, my darling, goodbye.'  

916
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:02,080
And he gave her back to her mother.

917
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,280
'Take her away,' she said.

918
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:07,840
And now they were alone.

919
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:13,840
Madame Bovary had her back to him, her 
face against the glass of the window.  

920
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,800
Leon was holding his cap in his hand 
and beating it gently against his thigh.

921
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,560
'It's going to rain,' said Emma.

922
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,760
'I've got a coat,' he answered.

923
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:28,160
'Ah!'

924
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,520
She turned away again, her face down.  

925
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,840
No one could have said what Emma 
was looking at through the glass.

926
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,120
'Well, this is goodbye!' he sighed.

927
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,400
She raised her head with a sudden movement.

928
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:50,320
'Yes, goodbye... Oh, go!'

929
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:54,880
They advanced towards each other. 
He held out his hand. She hesitated.  

930
01:33:56,080 --> 01:34:01,600
'In the English style, then!' she said, 
putting hers in his, forcing herself to laugh.

931
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:08,480
Leon felt her hand between his fingers, and 
it seemed that his whole life flowed into it.

932
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:17,840
Then he released her hand, their eyes 
met for a moment, and he was gone.
 
 
 

933
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,080
CHAPTER NINE

934
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:21,760
Starting Again

935
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:32,000
The next day, for Emma, was like a funeral. 
She felt the same grey unhappiness she had  

936
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:38,000
known when she came back from La Vaubyessard with 
the dance tunes playing in her head and her boring  

937
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:45,920
husband sitting opposite her. In her imagination, 
Leon came back to her, taller, more beautiful than  

938
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:52,560
ever; though he was separated from her, he had 
not left her. He was there, and the walls of the  

939
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:59,520
house seemed to hold his shadow. She asked herself 
again and again why she had not taken the chance  

940
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:05,440
when it was offered to her. Why hadn't she held 
him back with both hands, begged and prayed to  

941
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:11,040
him on her knees, when he tried to leave? She 
cursed herself for not giving her love to Leon;  

942
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:17,680
she was thirsty for his lips. She wanted to fly 
after him and join him, to throw herself into his  

943
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:25,040
arms and say, 'I have come, I am yours!' But Emma 
was afraid of all the difficulties in the way;  

944
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:31,360
she wanted Leon and dared not give herself, 
and her desire seemed to grow day by day.

945
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:39,840
And so the memory of Leon became the centre 
of her sorrow. It shone in the darkness,  

946
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,120
and she hurried towards it to 
warm herself by the dying flames.  

947
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:50,000
But the fires died down and, little 
by little, the flame of love cooled.  

948
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:56,800
Then the unhappy days of Tostes began all 
over again, but she felt herself much more  

949
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:04,000
unfortunate now; she had experience of grief, and 
she knew with certainty that it would never end.

950
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:11,440
A woman who has given up as much as she 
had, had the right to a few luxuries.  

951
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:17,200
In a single month, she bought fourteen 
francs' worth of lemons to clean her nails.  

952
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:23,360
She wrote to Rouen and ordered a blue silk 
dress, and from Lheureux she bought the  

953
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:29,520
finest scarf he had in his shop. She tied it 
round her waist, outside her dressing-gown,  

954
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:34,800
and would lie by the hour on the sofa with 
the curtains closed and a book in her hand.

955
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:42,960
But despite her little comforts, Emma did not 
become happy. She had that tight look at the  

956
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:49,360
corners of her mouth which you see in people who 
have failed in their lives. She was pale, white  

957
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:56,080
as a sheet, and she had an uncertain, hunted look 
in her eyes. And because she had discovered three  

958
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:03,520
grey hairs, she talked about being an old woman. 
Also, she had frequent attacks of dizziness.  

959
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:12,000
One day she spat blood and, as Charles rushed 
over to her, obviously very anxious, all she  

960
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:20,000
said was, 'Bah! What does it matter?' Charles 
went and shut himself in the surgery and wept.

961
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:27,280
Although the Bovary household had 
become a place of unhappiness again,  

962
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:33,360
life in Yonville continued as usual. 
People went to the church on Sundays,  

963
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:38,560
and on Wednesdays the market was held in 
the town square. From early morning the  

964
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,800
square filled up with farmers and people 
with goods to sell from as far as Rouen.

965
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:50,400
On Wednesdays the pharmacy never emptied. Some 
came to buy medicine, others to get advice.  

966
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:56,240
Monsieur Homais was a well-known man in all the 
villages near Yonville, and they thought he knew  

967
01:37:56,240 --> 01:38:01,840
more about doctoring than all the doctors 
put together. Emma was seated at her window  

968
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:07,280
and was amusing herself by looking at the crowd 
of country people, when she noticed a gentleman  

969
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:13,520
in a green coat. He was wearing yellow gloves 
and heavy, highly polished brown leather boots,  

970
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:18,560
and was making his way towards the 
doctor's house, followed by a farm worker.

971
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,400
'Can I see the doctor?' he asked the maid.  

972
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:27,040
'Tell him Monsieur Rodolphe 
Boulanger of La Huchette is here.'

973
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:34,720
Charles came into the room, and Monsieur Boulanger 
presented his man, who said he wanted to be bled  

974
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:40,640
to cure his dizziness. So Bovary told 
them to bring him a bandage and a basin,  

975
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,320
and asked the maid to hold it.

976
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:48,080
'Don't be afraid,' he said, turning to the 
farm worker, who had gone as white as a sheet.

977
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:54,480
'Not me, sir!' he replied. And he stuck 
out a great arm for Charles to cut,  

978
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:55,840
and out shot the blood.

979
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,640
'Hold the bowl nearer!' cried Charles.

980
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:03,840
'Look!' said the worker. 'You'd 
think it was a little fountain.  

981
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:08,000
My blood's red enough! You'd say that 
was a good sign now, wouldn't you?'

982
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:15,040
'Sometimes they feel nothing to start with. 
Then faintness begins, especially with big,  

983
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:19,040
strong people like this man here,' 
said Charles to Monsieur Boulanger.

984
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:24,560
Hearing this, the man gave a sudden 
movement and fell back into the chair.

985
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:28,880
'I knew it!' said Bovary, 
putting his finger on the vein.  

986
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:34,720
But now the bowl of blood was beginning to shake 
in the maid's hands, and she also turned pale.

987
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:40,320
'Emma! Quick! I want you!' shouted Charles.

988
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,600
She ran down the stairs.

989
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:46,320
'Get me some vinegar,' he said. 
'Good Lord, two of them at once!'

990
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:50,880
'It's nothing at all,' said 
Monsieur Boulanger calmly,  

991
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:54,320
as he took the maid in his arms 
and leaned her against the wall.

992
01:39:56,160 --> 01:40:01,200
Madame Bovary took hold of the basin. 
She bent down to put it under the table,  

993
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:05,440
and as she did so her long yellow dress 
spread out all around her on the floor.  

994
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:12,160
Then, as she stretched out her arm, she 
swayed a little and the cloth moved with her,  

995
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:18,960
following the shape of the body beneath it. After 
a moment she went to fetch a jug of water, and she  

996
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:23,200
was putting some pieces of sugar in it when the 
pharmacist arrived to see what was happening.

997
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:28,720
When things had become calmer, they 
began to talk about fainting attacks.  

998
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,160
Madame Bovary said she had never had one herself.

999
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:39,120
'That's unusual for a woman,' commented Monsieur 
Boulanger. 'But there are some sensitive people  

1000
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:44,160
around. I have seen soldiers faint at the 
sound of the big guns being prepared.'  

1001
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:50,960
Emma listened to him with admiration in 
her eyes. 'Anyway, my man's fainting has  

1002
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,600
given me the pleasure of meeting Madame,' 
he added, looking at Emma as he spoke.

1003
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:00,720
He put down three francs on 
the corner of the table, bowed  

1004
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:07,280
and departed. He was soon on the other side of the 
river, on the road back to La Huchette, and from  

1005
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:13,280
the bedroom window Emma could see him slowing down 
from time to time, like someone lost in thought.

1006
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:22,640
'Pretty little woman, this doctor's wife - very 
pretty indeed! Lovely teeth, dark eyes, neat foot.  

1007
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:29,680
She could be a Parisian. Where does she come from, 
and where did our fat country doctor pick her up?'  

1008
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:37,120
Monsieur Rodolphe Boulanger was a man of 
thirty-four, hard-hearted but clever. He  

1009
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:43,280
had plenty of experience with women, and knew how 
to get on with them. This latest one had attracted  

1010
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:50,400
his attention. 'The doctor looks a dull dog to me. 
I expect she's sick of him. He's got dirty nails  

1011
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:56,480
and three days' beard. While he's out seeing 
his patients, she sits at home mending socks.  

1012
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:02,720
And she's sick to death of it, wants to live in 
town and go to a dance every night. Poor little  

1013
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:08,640
woman! She's dying for love. A word or two about 
hearts and flowers and she'd be at your feet.  

1014
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:14,240
But getting rid of her afterwards, 
that's where the trouble would come in.'

1015
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:17,760
There was no one around, and 
the only sounds Rodolphe heard  

1016
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:22,160
were the grass brushing against his boots 
and the cry of the insects in the fields.  

1017
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:29,440
Once more he imagined Emma, dressed as he had seen 
her, and he started to undress her in his mind.

1018
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:35,600
'Oh, I'll have her!' he cried, striking 
out at the earth with his stick.

1019
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:43,680
Two weeks later it was the day of the 
famous Yonville Agricultural Show,  

1020
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:49,600
the most important event of the year. On the 
morning of the great day, the inhabitants were  

1021
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:54,480
all out on their doorsteps discussing the 
arrangements. The front of the Town Hall  

1022
01:42:54,480 --> 01:43:00,480
had been decorated, a tent had been put up for the 
lunch, and the whole town was alive with activity.

1023
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,960
The crowd poured into the High 
Street from both ends of the village.  

1024
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:12,880
What caused the greatest admiration were two tall 
poles covered with tiny lamps, standing beside the  

1025
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:19,040
platform where the most important guests would 
sit. Madame Lefrancois, the landlady of the Lion  

1026
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:24,800
d'Or, and Monsieur Homais, the pharmacist, stood 
on the steps of the hotel watching the growing  

1027
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:30,480
crowd and the men going in and out of the Cafe de 
France - the main competition to the Lion d'Or.

1028
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:37,840
'Well, that won't last much longer,' she said. 
'One more week and that will be the end of it.'

1029
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:43,200
Homais looked at her in surpise. 
She walked down her three steps.

1030
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:51,600
'What!' she said, speaking into his ear. 'Didn't 
you know? They're going to have to close down  

1031
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:56,880
and move this week. It's Lheureux that's making 
them do it, he's got them so deep into debt!'  

1032
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:02,800
And Madame Lefrancois began to tell Monsieur 
Homais how the draper had lent the owners of the  

1033
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:08,560
Cafe de France more money than they could ever pay 
back, and now they were having to sell everything.

1034
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,440
'Look!' she said. 'There he 
is, Lheureux - over there,  

1035
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:16,960
in the market. Look! He's bowing to Madame Bovary.  

1036
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:22,640
Do look! She's got a green hat on. Do you see 
her? She's leaning on Monsieur Boulanger's arm.'

1037
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:27,440
'Madame Bovary!' said Homais. 'Oh,  

1038
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:32,320
I must go over and say how do you do to her! 
She might like to have a seat on the platform.'

1039
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:36,800
Rodolphe saw him coming and 
walked more quickly but then,  

1040
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:40,240
as Madame Bovary was getting 
out of breath, he slowed down.

1041
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:47,840
'I wanted to avoid that fool - you know, that 
chemist fellow,' he said to her with a laugh.

1042
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:49,840
Emma smiled at him.

1043
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:56,240
'What does that smile mean?' he 
wondered. 'Is she making fun of  

1044
01:44:56,240 --> 01:45:01,840
me?' And he looked at her out of the corner 
of his eye as they walked on more quickly.

1045
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:07,200
When they reached the corner, Rodolphe, 
instead of going right into the square,  

1046
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:10,240
suddenly turned down a side-path, 
dragging Emma with him.

1047
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:16,240
'Good evening, Monsieur Lheureux,' 
he called out. 'See you later.'

1048
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:19,360
'You did that very well!' said Emma, laughing.

1049
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:23,520
'Why should I let these people 
bother me? And today of all days,  

1050
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,600
when I have the luck to be with you...'

1051
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:33,840
Emma blushed. He did not finish his sentence. 
Then he remarked on the fine weather,  

1052
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:38,960
and said how nice it was to walk on the grass 
where small yellow flowers had sprung up.

1053
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:45,440
'Look,' he said, 'young girls in love 
use these to see if they are loved.  

1054
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:50,080
Suppose I picked one of these. What 
do you think it would tell me?'

1055
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,960
'Are you in love?' she said, with a little cough.

1056
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:59,440
'Ah! Who knows?' answered Rodolphe.

1057
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:06,880
The market square and the fields around continued 
to fill up with people. The judging was now going  

1058
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:12,880
on and the farmers, lined up one after another, 
were all crowding into a ring. There were the  

1059
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:19,360
farm animals in a long, irregular line. Among the 
sleepy pigs and cows, bare-armed men were holding  

1060
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:24,480
on to great male horses which pulled with all 
their strength in the direction of the females.  

1061
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:30,560
These stood quite still, holding their heads 
down, while their young rested in their shadows.

1062
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:37,760
By now, Emma and Monsieur Boulanger 
had come round to the field.  

1063
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:42,560
They discussed the people they saw, how 
Paris was so much more interesting than  

1064
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,880
a place like Yonville, and they laughed 
at the fashions of the farmers' wives.

1065
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:52,960
'But anyway,' he said, 'when 
you live in the country -'

1066
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:54,560
'What's the point of looking good?'

1067
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:59,120
'I agree,' answered Rodolphe. 'Not one of these  

1068
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:01,680
people knows when a coat is 
well cut and when it isn't.'

1069
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:08,080
And they agreed that life away 
from town was hardly worth living.

1070
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:11,840
'Which is why,' said Rodolphe, 
'I am so sad at times.'

1071
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:18,080
'You!' she broke in with amazement. 'I 
thought you had nothing to worry about!'

1072
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:24,400
'Ah, yes, it seems so, but we cannot 
always show the world who we really are,  

1073
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:29,600
our true selves. Whenever I 
look at a cemetery by moonlight,  

1074
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:33,760
I ask myself if I wouldn't be happier 
lying there asleep with the rest of them.'

1075
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:38,480
'But what about your friends? 
You don't think of them.'

1076
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,480
'My friends? What friends? What friends 
have I got? Who cares about me?'

1077
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:50,720
So they walked on arm in arm, ignoring 
the arrival of the guests of honour,  

1078
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:54,640
Emma leaning against this strong 
man with such pain in his heart.  

1079
01:47:55,760 --> 01:48:01,040
As the crowd gathered to hear the speeches, 
Rodolphe, accompanied by Madame Bovary,  

1080
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:05,760
went up on to the first floor of the Town 
Hall into the empty council meeting room.  

1081
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,840
He fetched two chairs and, bringing them close 
up to the window, they sat down side by side.

1082
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,680
As soon as the speeches began, 
people quietened down a little,  

1083
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:19,760
and Emma leaned forward to see better.

1084
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,000
'I'd better get a bit 
farther back,' said Rodolphe.

1085
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,640
'Why?' asked Emma.

1086
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,120
'They might see me from down below.  

1087
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:34,000
And then I would have to give explanations for 
at least a fortnight, and with my reputation...'

1088
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:38,960
'Oh, you're making yourself sound 
much worse than you are,' said Emma.

1089
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,920
'No, no; it's horrible, I tell you!'

1090
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:47,040
The voice of the next speaker went on 
like an angry insect in the hot sun.

1091
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:52,320
'But,' added Rodolphe, 'the world may be right.'

1092
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,680
'What do you mean?' she asked.

1093
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:01,280
'Well,' he said, 'don't you know that there 
are some people who are never at peace;  

1094
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:08,240
people who desire dreams and action, the wildest 
pleasures - but after passion comes regret!'

1095
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:14,720
She looked at him as if he were a traveller who 
has journeyed through strange and far-off lands.

1096
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:21,600
'We poor women, we never have such 
good reasons for regret,' she said.

1097
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:28,320
'Ah, but to behave as badly as I 
have does not make you any happier!'

1098
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,920
'But does one ever find happiness?'

1099
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:36,000
'Yes, one day,' he replied.

1100
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:43,760
The speaker continued to praise the farmers, 
their animals and their rich fields. Some  

1101
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:48,960
listened and some began to sleep in their 
seats, heads falling forward in the summer heat.

1102
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:56,640
'Yes,' said Rodolphe, 'you don't have to 
think about it; one day you meet someone,  

1103
01:49:56,640 --> 01:50:02,320
and the horizon opens up in front of you. There 
are no more questions. It's as if you have already  

1104
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:09,120
met one another in your dreams.' (Here he looked 
at Emma.) 'There in front of you is the jewel  

1105
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:15,520
you have been looking for; there before your 
eyes. Nevertheless, you dare not believe it;  

1106
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:20,320
you cannot see clearly, it is as if you had just 
stepped out of the darkness into the light.'

1107
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:28,400
And as he said this, Rodolphe passed his hand 
over his face, then he let it fall on Emma's,  

1108
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:35,120
who took hers away. Still the speaker read on, 
praising those who did their duty on the land.

1109
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:43,360
'Ah, there he goes again!' said Rodolphe. 'Duty, 
duty - always duty! I'm sick to death of the word!  

1110
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,800
We must follow our hearts 
- that is our true duty!'

1111
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:55,280
'Yes, but - but -' said Madame Bovary, 'don't you 
also think we must follow the laws of society?'

1112
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:03,920
'Ah! But there are two laws,' he replied. 
'There is the little, unimportant man-made law,  

1113
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:11,680
always changing, made by fools like that one down 
there. And there is the other, which never changes  

1114
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:16,640
and is all around us, like the countryside 
and the blue heavens that give us light.'

1115
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,680
The whole square was now crowded with people.  

1116
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:25,760
They could be seen leaning on 
their elbows at every window,  

1117
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:31,760
others standing at their doors. In spite of the 
silence, the speaker's voice was lost in the  

1118
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:37,920
air. It rose in broken phrases, interrupted here 
and there by the sound of chairs on the stones.

1119
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:43,680
Rodolphe had moved nearer to Emma, 
and said to her in a low voice,  

1120
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:50,000
speaking rapidly, 'Don't society's 
demands disgust you? The best feelings,  

1121
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:56,560
the purest thoughts are attacked, controlled, and 
if at last two souls do meet, they cannot unite.  

1122
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:02,160
They will try, they will call out to each 
other. But sooner or later - in six months,  

1123
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:08,960
ten years - they will come together, they 
will love; they are born for each other.'

1124
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:13,920
Lifting his face towards Emma, 
he looked closely at her.  

1125
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:18,960
She noticed in his eyes small golden 
lines coming from the dark centre,  

1126
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:24,160
she smelt the perfume on his hair, and 
she half closed her eyes to breathe it in.  

1127
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:30,480
She took off her gloves, she wiped her hands, 
then tried to cool her face with her handkerchief.  

1128
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:36,080
Through the sound of her blood beating in 
her ears, she heard the sound of the crowd  

1129
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:40,560
and the voice of the speaker telling 
them to work harder, to be good citizens.

1130
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:47,600
Now Rodolphe took her hand and she did not 
take it away. As the names of the prize  

1131
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:53,280
winners in the show were read out below, he 
told her he had never loved anyone before her,  

1132
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:58,320
and he would love her for the rest of his 
life. He pressed her hand, and felt its  

1133
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:04,960
warmth and life - like a bird held for a moment, 
perhaps trying to escape, perhaps responding.

1134
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:10,960
'Oh, thank you, thank you!' he 
cried. 'You do not reject me.  

1135
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:16,080
How sweet you are! You know that I am yours.'

1136
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,800
Suddenly the wind rose, shaking the curtains  

1137
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:24,960
and causing the peasant women in the square 
to hold on to the wings of their white hats.  

1138
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:29,280
The speaker began to speak more 
quickly, more enthusiastically,  

1139
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:34,800
but neither Rodolphe nor Emma were listening. 
They sat and looked into each other's eyes.  

1140
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:43,680
Their lips were dry, their bodies full of desire, 
and Emma no longer felt a need to resist. Down  

1141
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:49,680
in the square the speakers continued, the prizes 
were given. The celebrations would be over soon.

1142
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:57,440
Madame Bovary took Rodolphe's arm, and he walked 
with her back to her house. They said goodbye at  

1143
01:53:57,440 --> 01:54:01,520
her front door, after which he went and 
walked in the fields near the river.
 
 
 

1144
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:05,280
CHAPTER TEN

1145
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:07,840
Presents for a Lover

1146
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:12,880
Six weeks went by, and 
Rodolphe did not contact Emma.  

1147
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:18,640
'I must not go back too soon,' he had 
said to himself. 'It would be a mistake.'

1148
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:23,040
The week after the show, he went off shooting.  

1149
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:29,120
When the hunting was over he wondered if he had 
left it too long, but then he thought to himself,  

1150
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:36,240
'If she loved me from the first day, by now she 
will love me even more. I will let her wait.'

1151
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:43,520
When he saw how pale she became when he entered 
the room, he knew he had made the right decision.

1152
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,120
She was alone and it was getting dark.  

1153
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:53,520
Rodolphe remained standing, and Emma was 
barely able to answer his first greeting.

1154
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:57,600
'I've been busy,' he said. 'I haven't been well.'

1155
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:01,120
'Nothing serious?' she asked quickly.

1156
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:08,000
'Oh, well, no,' said Rodolphe, sitting 
down. 'I didn't want to come here again.'

1157
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:09,680
'Why?'

1158
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:12,400
'Can't you guess?'

1159
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:19,520
He looked at her again, but with such a look 
of love that she lowered her eyes with a blush.

1160
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:22,880
'Emma!' he began again.

1161
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,960
'Sir!' she cried, moving back a little.

1162
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:35,280
'Ah! You see perfectly well now that I 
was right not to return,' he said sadly,  

1163
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:41,120
'but I have been thinking of you; thinking 
and thinking till I've become almost mad.  

1164
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:49,600
Ah, forgive me! I'll go away - far away - and 
you will never hear of me again. But today,  

1165
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:53,600
somehow, it seemed that 
something, I don't know what,  

1166
01:55:53,600 --> 01:56:00,960
made me come to you. Who can help falling in love 
with someone who is so beautiful, so charming?'

1167
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:06,880
It was the first time in her 
life Emma had heard such words.  

1168
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,240
She turned towards him with tears in her eyes.

1169
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:15,840
'Oh, how kind you are!' she said.

1170
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:27,040
'No,' he said, 'I love you, that's all. You know 
I do, don't you? Tell me you know it - just one  

1171
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:34,080
word, one little word!' And Rodolphe began to 
go down on his knees. But there was a noise of  

1172
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:38,640
someone moving around in the kitchen, and 
he noticed that the door was not closed.

1173
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,960
'It would be so kind of you,' he said, getting up,  

1174
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,560
'if you could let me see your 
house. It's such a charming place.'

1175
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:50,800
Madame Bovary said she would be happy to do this,  

1176
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,280
and they were just getting 
up when Charles came in.

1177
01:56:54,880 --> 01:57:01,520
'Good morning, Doctor,' said Rodolphe. 'Madame,' 
he continued, 'was talking to me about her health.  

1178
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:05,840
I was saying that a little horse 
riding might be a good thing.'

1179
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,720
'An excellent idea... You 
should do that, darling.'

1180
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:18,800
When she replied that she had no horse, Monsieur 
Rodolphe offered to lend her one. She refused,  

1181
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:23,840
and he did not insist. And 
that was the end of the visit.

1182
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:29,200
'Why didn't you accept Monsieur Boulanger's 
offer? It was very good of him,'  

1183
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,720
said Charles when they were alone.

1184
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,720
She said that perhaps people 
would think it rather odd.

1185
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:38,400
'Well, who cares about that?' said Charles.  

1186
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:42,000
'Health, that's the main 
thing. It was silly of you.'

1187
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:47,200
'And how do you expect me to go riding 
when I haven't got the right clothes?'

1188
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:52,240
'We will get you some,' he replied.

1189
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:55,920
The promise of new clothes was 
enough to make Emma change her mind.

1190
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:03,200
When Emma's riding clothes were ready, 
Charles wrote to Monsieur Boulanger  

1191
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:08,080
saying that his wife could go any time, and 
that they were grateful for his kind offer.

1192
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:16,560
Next day, Rodolphe appeared at Charles's 
door with two horses. He had put on a pair  

1193
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:22,000
of new riding-boots, telling himself that she had 
certainly never seen anything like them before,  

1194
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:25,680
and Emma was charmed with the way he looked.

1195
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:32,480
As soon as he felt the grass under him, 
Emma's horse started to move more quickly,  

1196
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:37,920
and Rodolphe came along beside her. Every 
now and then they exchanged a word or two.  

1197
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:43,760
She rode with her head a little forward, her 
hand well up and her right arm stretched out,  

1198
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:49,120
and she let herself follow the movements 
of the horse. They rode on like this for  

1199
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:54,240
fifteen or twenty minutes until, at the 
top of a small hill, the horses stopped.

1200
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:03,360
It was early in October, and a thin mist was 
spread over the land. Sometimes the sun would  

1201
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:07,760
shine through a break in the clouds and 
light up the distant roofs of Yonville,  

1202
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:14,560
with the gardens near the water, the yards, the 
walls and the church. Emma half closed her eyes  

1203
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:21,040
to see her house, and never had this poor 
village in which she lived seemed so small.

1204
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:27,840
After a moment, Rodolphe and Emma turned 
off and rode along the edge of the wood.  

1205
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:32,800
She turned away her head every 
now and again to avoid his eyes,  

1206
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:38,320
and saw only the trunks of the trees. Just 
as they entered the wood, the sun came out.

1207
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,840
'God is with us!' said Rodolphe.

1208
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:45,360
'You think so?' she answered.

1209
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:49,440
'Come on! Come on!' was his reply.

1210
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:56,960
The path narrowed as they went into the wood, 
and sometimes, to keep away the branches,  

1211
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:03,920
he rode close up to her and Emma felt his knee 
rubbing against her leg. The sky was blue now, and  

1212
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:10,000
not a leaf moved. They got down from their horses 
and Emma walked a little further down the path.  

1213
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:15,280
Rodolphe came up behind her, stretched 
out his arm and put it round her waist.  

1214
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:19,680
She made an effort to break away, 
but he continued to hold her,  

1215
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:22,800
so she turned and walked back 
towards where they had stopped.

1216
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:28,320
'Oh, stay!' said Rodolphe. 
'We must not go yet! Stay!'

1217
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:34,720
And he took her to a little pool, whose surface 
was covered with small green water plants.

1218
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:41,280
'It is wrong of me! Wrong, wrong!' she 
cried. 'I am mad to listen to you.'

1219
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:45,200
'Why? Emma! Emma!'

1220
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:50,400
'Oh, Rodolphe!' she cried, dropping 
her head against his shoulder.

1221
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:57,120
With a deep sigh she threw back her head, 
giving her white neck to his kisses and,  

1222
02:00:57,120 --> 02:01:03,360
almost fainting, in tears, her whole body shaking 
with emotion, hiding her face in her hands,  

1223
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:07,840
she surrendered herself to him.

1224
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:14,160
When evening began to fall the sun, shining 
through the branches, was bright in her eyes.  

1225
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:20,960
Everywhere was silence. She could feel 
her heart as it began to beat again,  

1226
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:25,280
she could feel the blood moving 
through her body like a stream of milk.  

1227
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:32,880
And then, far, far away, beyond the wood, on 
the hills across the valley, she heard a cry,  

1228
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:40,400
strange and distant, a voice that hung in the 
air, and she listened to it in silence. Rodolphe  

1229
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:45,520
was standing with a cigar between his teeth, 
cleaning his fingernails with a small knife.

1230
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:52,880
They returned to Yonville by the way they 
had come. They saw the tracks of their horses  

1231
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:58,480
in the soil, side by side, and there were the 
same bushes and the same stones in the grass.  

1232
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:04,240
Nothing about them had changed, 
but for her something had happened,  

1233
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:08,080
something more surprising than if the 
mountains had fallen into the sea.

1234
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:15,840
When she was alone in her room after dinner, she 
looked at herself in the mirror and was amazed at  

1235
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:25,200
her own face. Never had her eyes looked so big, 
so dark, so deep. It was as if she had become  

1236
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:33,840
another woman. And she kept saying to herself 
over and over again, 'I have a lover, a lover.'

1237
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:44,000
From that first day they wrote to each other 
every night. Emma took her letter to the end of  

1238
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:49,600
the garden near the river and put it in a gap 
in the wall. Rodolphe would come and take it  

1239
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:54,480
and put another in its place, and always she 
complained that his letters were too short.

1240
02:02:55,600 --> 02:03:00,960
The time she had with him was too short too, 
so whenever Charles was called out early,  

1241
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:05,600
Emma got up, threw on some clothes and ran 
through the fields to Rodolphe's house.  

1242
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:11,520
At this early hour Rodolphe would still 
be asleep, and Emma seemed like a spring  

1243
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:17,280
morning coming into his room. Laughing, he would 
pull her towards him and down on to his breast,  

1244
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:24,800
and afterwards it would take them a quarter of an 
hour to say goodbye. Emma would burst out crying;  

1245
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:27,840
she would have liked to stay with Rodolphe 
always and never leave him any more.  

1246
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:35,040
But one day, when she came in unexpectedly, 
a look of annoyance passed over his face.

1247
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:41,840
'What's the matter?' she said. 
'Don't you feel well? Tell me!'

1248
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:47,280
At first he said nothing, but then, 
looking very serious about it,  

1249
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:50,240
he told her that he was worried 
about these early morning visits.  

1250
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:55,840
People would start talking about her. 
They needed another meeting place.

1251
02:03:56,640 --> 02:04:01,120
Rodolphe said he would look out for a house 
outside Yonville where they could be together,  

1252
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:07,120
but all through the winter, three or four times a 
week, and when it was quite dark, the only place  

1253
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:13,200
they could find was Emma's garden. They would come 
together there after Charles had gone to sleep.  

1254
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:18,960
The cold made them hold each other tighter; 
their eyes, though they could hardly see them  

1255
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:24,800
in the growing darkness, seemed bigger. On wet 
nights they would take shelter in the surgery.  

1256
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:29,680
She would light one of the kitchen candles 
and Rodolphe made himself quite at home.  

1257
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:35,280
The sight of the bookcase and the desk - 
everything in the room, in fact - seemed to amuse  

1258
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:40,960
him, and he could not stop himself from making 
all sorts of little jokes about Charles. This  

1259
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:46,720
did not please Emma. She would have liked him to 
be a little more serious, a little more dramatic.

1260
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:54,000
But Rodolphe felt no need to change his ways and 
was, in fact, becoming a little bored with Emma's  

1261
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:00,400
delicate emotions and sensitivities. She even 
talked about wanting a ring - a proper wedding  

1262
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:07,440
ring - as a symbol of their union. He never spoke 
to her now as he used to, saying the sweet, tender  

1263
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:12,880
things that had made her cry with happiness. He 
never kissed her and held her in the old way.  

1264
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:20,160
No! That great love of theirs, on 
whose waves she had been carried away,  

1265
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:25,440
seemed to be growing shallower beneath her, 
like the waters of a river in a dry summer,  

1266
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:28,880
and now she could see the mud that lay beneath it!

1267
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:35,280
As Emma grew to understand that this 
great love affair might not be for ever,  

1268
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:42,800
Rodolphe found her becoming more and more distant, 
even cooler towards him. For a few weeks she even  

1269
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:48,800
spent more time with Charles, trying to see if 
she could love him better. But it was no use,  

1270
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:55,200
and Rodolphe thought to himself, 'She'll get 
over it. It's just one of her little ways.'

1271
02:05:56,640 --> 02:06:01,440
He was right. All he had to do was 
to keep away, to miss their meeting  

1272
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:06,560
for three or four nights, and once again 
her complaints stopped and she was his!

1273
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:13,920
So love began for them again. 
Often, in the middle of the day,  

1274
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:20,320
Emma would take up a pen and write to him. And 
she did not only send letters, but also presents,  

1275
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:25,920
small expensive things that she could not afford, 
and which she could not ask her husband to buy.

1276
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:31,280
It was Monsieur Lheureux, the draper, 
who was able to help her here.  

1277
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:37,200
As soon as he heard that Madame Bovary was 
buying gifts for someone, he made sure he  

1278
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:42,640
met her as often as he could. He told her 
all about the latest deliveries from Paris,  

1279
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:50,320
was very helpful and never asked for his money. 
Emma found this a very easy way to satisfy her  

1280
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:56,720
wish to please her lover, and she took full 
advantage of it. For example, she wanted to  

1281
02:06:56,720 --> 02:07:01,040
buy Rodolphe a very handsome riding whip that 
was on show at an umbrella shop in Rouen.  

1282
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,160
And next week, there was Monsieur Lheureux 
putting it on her dining room table.

1283
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:14,320
But the day after that, he came along with a bill 
for two hundred and seventy francs! Emma did not  

1284
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:21,040
know what to do. All the drawers in the desk had 
been emptied out. She owed wages to the servants,  

1285
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:25,360
and Bovary was anxiously waiting for 
a payment from Monsieur Derozerays,  

1286
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:29,680
who, in previous years, had always paid 
his doctor's bill some time in July.

1287
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:37,600
At first she managed to get rid of Lheureux, but 
in the end he lost patience. He had to pay his  

1288
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:43,680
bills, other people were asking him for the money! 
He would be forced to ask her to return the goods.

1289
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,680
'Very well, take them,' said Emma.

1290
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:54,880
'Oh, I was only joking!' he replied. 'The 
only thing that worries me is the riding whip.  

1291
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:58,960
I know! I'll ask the doctor 
to let me have it back.'

1292
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:02,160
'No, don't!' she cried out.

1293
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:10,800
'Aha, I've got you!' thought Lheureux to 
himself. And, sure of being on the right track,  

1294
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:18,160
he went out, saying under his breath, 
'Right! We shall see, we shall see!'

1295
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:25,120
She was wondering how she was going to get out 
of this difficulty when the maid came in and  

1296
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:32,000
put a little packet on the table, 'From Monsieur 
Derozerays.' Emma took the envelope and tore it  

1297
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:38,960
open. It was enough money to pay her debts! 
She heard Charles coming up the stairs and,  

1298
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:43,840
without thinking, she threw the money to the back 
of the drawer, locked it, and took out the key.

1299
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:50,080
Three days later Lheureux reappeared.

1300
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:56,240
'I want to suggest an arrangement,' he said. 
'If, instead of the sum agreed, you would...'

1301
02:08:56,240 --> 02:09:00,240
'There you are,' said she, putting 
the four hundred francs in his hand.  

1302
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:06,880
She was safe for the moment, but what would 
happen next time? What could she do to escape?

1303
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:11,040
Her dream now was to go away with Rodolphe.  

1304
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:16,560
One night when they met in the garden, and 
she was at her saddest and most beautiful,  

1305
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:21,520
he asked her what he could do to help 
her, to bring back the smile to her face.

1306
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:25,360
'What must we do? What do you want?'

1307
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:32,080
'Take me away!' she cried. 'Take 
me from here... Oh, I beg you!'

1308
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:35,360
'But...' Rodolphe began.

1309
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:36,960
'Yes?'

1310
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:39,920
'What about your little girl?'

1311
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:43,680
She thought a minute or two and then answered,  

1312
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:47,680
'We'll take her with us. 
It's the only thing to do.'

1313
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:55,600
'What a woman!' he said to himself, as he 
saw her disappear. Someone was calling.

1314
02:09:57,200 --> 02:10:02,240
But now Emma believed that she would be able 
to escape, and this became her only topic  

1315
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:06,960
of conversation with Rodolphe. She would 
lean her head on his shoulder and whisper,  

1316
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:13,760
'Ah, when we are in the coach! Can you 
imagine it? Is it possible? It seems  

1317
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:18,720
to me that the moment I feel it moving, it 
will be as if we were going up in a balloon,  

1318
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:25,040
as if we were going to the clouds. Do you 
know, I'm counting the days! Aren't you?'

1319
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:33,360
Never had Madame Bovary looked so beautiful as 
now. Charles thought her as delicious as on the  

1320
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:39,280
day she became his bride. When he came home 
late at night, he did not dare to wake her.  

1321
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:44,800
The night-lamp threw a ring of light on the 
ceiling as she lay sleeping beside her daughter.  

1322
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:49,280
Charles would stand and look at 
them, dreaming of the future,  

1323
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:57,360
of his beautiful wife and his growing child. But 
he was not in Emma's dreams; she was heading for  

1324
02:10:57,360 --> 02:11:03,200
a new land in a coach pulled by four white 
horses and with her lover by her side.

1325
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:09,920
She was so certain she would be leaving that 
she sent for Monsieur Lheureux and ordered a  

1326
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:15,920
heavy travelling coat and a travelling case. She 
told him to keep the things at the shop when they  

1327
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:21,680
arrived, and she would collect them in a week 
or two. It was, in fact, the following month  

1328
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:26,800
that they were going to run away. She would leave 
Yonville as if she were going shopping in Rouen.  

1329
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:32,480
Rodolphe would have booked the seats, arranged 
the passports, and written to Paris in order  

1330
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:38,000
to have the mail coach all to themselves 
as far as Marseilles. There they would buy  

1331
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:44,800
a carriage and go right through to Genoa. In 
all this planning the child was never mentioned,  

1332
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:51,840
and Rodolphe avoided any reference to her; 
perhaps Emma had given up the idea of taking her.

1333
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:58,480
However, Rodolphe then found he needed a 
fortnight to complete certain business matters;  

1334
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:05,840
then, after a week, he needed another fortnight. 
Then he found he was not feeling very well so  

1335
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:12,720
there was another delay, and then he went away 
on a journey. The whole of August went by and  

1336
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:19,840
finally, after all these delays, the date of their 
departure was fixed for 4 September, a Monday.

1337
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:26,800
On the evening of their last Saturday in Yonville, 
Rodolphe came to see her earlier than usual.

1338
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:30,160
'Is everything ready?' she asked.

1339
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:31,360
'Yes.'

1340
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:34,640
'You're sad,' said Emma.

1341
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:36,960
'No. Why?'

1342
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:43,040
'Is it because you are going away?' she 
went on. 'Leaving the things you love,  

1343
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:49,280
the things that have been your 
life? Ah, I understand! But I,  

1344
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:56,160
I have nothing in the world! You are everything 
to me. And so I shall be everything to you.'

1345
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:01,840
'Oh, what a lovely night!' said Rodolphe.

1346
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:07,280
'We shall have many more nights together,' she 
answered. And then, as if speaking to herself,  

1347
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:13,120
she went on, 'Yes, it will be good 
to travel. But why is my heart so  

1348
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:18,000
sad? Is it fear of the unknown... or 
the break with all I have been used to?  

1349
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:26,880
Or else...? No, it is because I am too happy 
in my happiness! How weak I am! Forgive me!'

1350
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:33,200
'There is still time,' he exclaimed. 
'Think! You may regret it later.'

1351
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:35,840
'Never!' she cried.

1352
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:38,480
The clock struck twelve.

1353
02:13:39,680 --> 02:13:45,040
'Midnight!' she said. 'Tomorrow is already 
here! We have just one more day to wait!'

1354
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:47,040
He rose to go.

1355
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:49,440
'You've got the passports?'

1356
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:50,480
'Yes.'

1357
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:52,880
'You haven't forgotten anything?'

1358
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:54,080
'No.'

1359
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:56,160
'You're sure?'

1360
02:13:57,440 --> 02:13:58,240
'Quite sure.'

1361
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:03,520
'You'll be waiting for me at the Hotel de 
Provence, won't you? At twelve o'clock?'

1362
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:05,120
He nodded.

1363
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:12,080
'Tomorrow, then!' said Emma, 
and she watched him go.

1364
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:13,360
He did not look back.

1365
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:22,560
After a few minutes Rodolphe stopped, and when he 
saw her white figure disappear into the shadows  

1366
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:28,480
his heart began to beat so wildly that he had to 
lean against a tree to keep himself from falling.

1367
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:41,040
'What a fool I am! But, never mind, she was a fine 
little woman!' And as he said it, Emma's beauty,  

1368
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:47,120
the thought of all the times they had had 
together, came back into his mind. For a moment  

1369
02:14:47,120 --> 02:14:51,680
tears came to his eyes, but then he 
felt a wave of anger against her.  

1370
02:14:53,360 --> 02:14:58,880
'After all,' he cried, 'I couldn't just go and 
bury myself alive like that - and have to look  

1371
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:07,840
after the child too! And think of the worry, the 
expense! Ah, no, it would have been too silly!'
 
 
 

1372
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:10,880
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1373
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:12,560
Goodbye

1374
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:18,080
The letter Rodolphe wrote that 
evening ended with the words:

1375
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:23,040
... I shall be far away when 
you read these sad lines.  

1376
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:30,640
I have made up my mind to go at once, so that 
I cannot see you again! I shall come back,  

1377
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:35,840
no doubt, and perhaps one day we shall talk 
together of the time when we were lovers.

1378
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:37,120
Your Friend.

1379
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:47,040
As she read these words the next morning, 
Emma's first thought was to kill herself. Life  

1380
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:52,560
no longer had meaning; how could she eat another 
meal, sit in the same room as her husband?  

1381
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:59,760
Rodolphe! How could she live without him? The room 
started to spin around her, nothing was still,  

1382
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:02,480
she could not see, and everything went black.

1383
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:07,200
Then Charles was shouting for 
help, Berthe was screaming,  

1384
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:12,000
and Felicite, the maid, with shaking hands, 
was loosening her mistress's clothing.  

1385
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:17,680
Emma herself lay stretched out on 
the floor, shaking from head to foot.

1386
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:23,520
'Speak! speak!' Charles kept on saying. 
'Emma! It's me, your own Charles,  

1387
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:28,400
who loves you. Don't you know me? Here! 
Here's your little one. Kiss her, Emma!'

1388
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:33,360
The child stretched out her arms to 
her mother, to put them round her neck.  

1389
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:38,479
But Emma turned away her head 
and cried, 'No, no... No one!'

1390
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:45,440
She fainted away again. They carried her 
up to bed. She lay there, her mouth open,  

1391
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:52,240
her eyes shut, her hands open, quite still. 
The tears ran from her eyes on to the pillow.

1392
02:16:54,560 --> 02:17:01,201
For forty-three days Charles never left Emma's 
side. His patients had to take care of themselves.  

1393
02:17:02,640 --> 02:17:09,840
He called in Monsieur Canivet, in consultation. 
He sent to Rouen for Dr Lariviere, his old master;  

1394
02:17:10,399 --> 02:17:17,359
he was desperate. What scared him most was 
Emma's depressed condition. She did not speak,  

1395
02:17:17,359 --> 02:17:21,519
took no notice of anything, and did 
not even seem to suffer - as if her  

1396
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:25,520
soul and body were both resting after 
the shock through which they had passed.

1397
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:33,920
About halfway through October she was able to 
sit up in bed, supported by pillows. Charles  

1398
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:40,480
cried when he saw her eating her first piece of 
bread and jam. She began to recover her strength  

1399
02:17:40,479 --> 02:17:45,839
and got up for an hour or two in the afternoons, 
and one day, when she was feeling much better,  

1400
02:17:46,399 --> 02:17:50,080
he persuaded her to walk a little 
in the garden, leaning on his arm.  

1401
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:59,280
So they went, arm in arm, to the bottom of the 
garden and its low wall. Slowly she looked up  

1402
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:06,480
and, shading her eyes with her hand, she 
looked away, far, far away, into the distance.  

1403
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:12,720
But there was nothing on the skyline except 
the smoke of burning grass on the hills.

1404
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:18,640
She turned back to look into the 
garden, and remembered Rodolphe,  

1405
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:24,720
remembered their nights of love in this place, 
and fell back into Charles's arms, seeing nothing.  

1406
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:30,800
That night she was as ill as before, though 
this time her condition was more complicated.  

1407
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:36,080
First it was her heart that troubled 
her. Then her chest, or her head.  

1408
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:40,800
Then she had attacks of vomiting, which Charles 
thought might be the early signs of cancer.  

1409
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:45,840
And on top of all this trouble, the 
poor man was worried about money.

1410
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:51,920
First, he did not know how he was going to pay 
Monsieur Homais for all the medicines he had had  

1411
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:59,200
from him. And the bills kept pouring in. Monsieur 
Lheureux, the draper, was especially difficult.  

1412
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:05,520
In fact, when Emma's illness was at its worst, 
Lheureux, taking advantage of the situation,  

1413
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:11,760
had rushed over with the coat, the travelling 
bag, two travelling boxes instead of one, and  

1414
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:18,000
other unordered items as well! Charles, of course, 
said he had no use for them, but it was no good;  

1415
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,000
the goods had been ordered, and the 
draper was not going to take them back.  

1416
02:19:23,439 --> 02:19:29,200
In the end, Bovary found himself signing a 
document promising to pay in six months - and  

1417
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:34,960
then borrowing another thousand francs! So 
Charles's problems worsened, while Lheureux  

1418
02:19:34,960 --> 02:19:41,200
was delighted to have both husband and wife 
in his debt. He saw it as a good investment.

1419
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:46,720
Charles often wondered how he was going 
to pay all this money back next year.  

1420
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:51,520
He thought and thought; maybe he 
should ask his father for help,  

1421
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:58,960
or sell something. But his father would not 
listen, and he - well, he had nothing to sell.  

1422
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:05,200
And then the whole situation began to look so 
black that he hurriedly pushed it out of his mind.

1423
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:13,680
The winter was a hard one, and Emma took longer 
to recover this time. When the weather was fine,  

1424
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:17,520
they pushed her chair up to the window, 
so that she could look out on the square.  

1425
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:24,720
She had now taken a violent dislike to the garden, 
and the curtains on that side were always closed.  

1426
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:31,360
Now she passed her time reading religious texts 
which the priest brought for her, and Rodolphe  

1427
02:20:31,359 --> 02:20:38,160
was pushed back into a hidden place in her heart. 
And although her recovery continued, she was so  

1428
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:43,840
much changed that she even enjoyed the company 
of the respectable married women of Yonville.

1429
02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:49,120
When the spring came, she had the 
whole garden torn up from end to end.  

1430
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:55,519
Her old energy had begun to return as her health 
improved, and although Monsieur Bournisien,  

1431
02:20:55,520 --> 02:21:00,480
the priest, still continued to visit her 
every day, she went to church less often.  

1432
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:06,639
She began to enjoy time spent out of doors, 
looking over the new garden, even sitting  

1433
02:21:06,640 --> 02:21:13,040
outside with Charles and Monsieur Homais in the 
warmer evenings. It was on one of these evenings,  

1434
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:17,040
as Monsieur Homais talked about the pleasures 
one could gain from literature and music,  

1435
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:24,320
that the idea of going to see Lucia di Lammermoor 
at the theatre in Rouen was raised. Emma was  

1436
02:21:24,319 --> 02:21:30,160
against the idea at first, but Charles felt that 
the change would do her good, and he wanted to  

1437
02:21:30,160 --> 02:21:37,359
give her a little pleasure, despite his debts and 
their other worries. So Monsieur and Madame Bovary  

1438
02:21:37,359 --> 02:21:43,200
drove in to Rouen on the Friday coach and got 
down at the Hotel de la Croix Rouge, in the place  

1439
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:54,000
Beauvoisine. Leaving Emma at the hotel, Charles at 
once went out to buy tickets for the theatre.
 
 
 

1440
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:54,960
CHAPTER TWELVE

1441
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:57,040
A Visit to the Theatre

1442
02:21:59,439 --> 02:22:04,000
Emma was pleased that her husband had bought 
good seats, and when she sat down she could  

1443
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:08,720
not resist a little smile of pride as she 
looked at the ordinary people down below.  

1444
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:15,439
Soon the candles were being lit, the musicians 
were taking their places and the opera was  

1445
02:22:15,439 --> 02:22:22,319
starting. When they began to play, she lost 
herself in the music, her eyes almost blinded  

1446
02:22:22,319 --> 02:22:29,359
by the richness of the colours, the beauty of 
the singers. And their voices, their beautiful  

1447
02:22:29,359 --> 02:22:36,160
bodies dressed in the finest clothes you could 
imagine, their noble emotions - it was too much!

1448
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:40,800
Poor Charles, however, 
could understand none of it.

1449
02:22:42,080 --> 02:22:45,519
'Why is he so unkind to her?' he whispered.

1450
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:50,880
'But he isn't,' she answered. 'He's her lover.'

1451
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:55,760
Emma tried to explain as well as she 
could, but he confessed that he could  

1452
02:22:55,760 --> 02:23:00,000
not follow the story because all this 
music stopped him from hearing the words.

1453
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:04,399
'What does it matter?' said Emma. 'Be quiet!'

1454
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,520
'Well, you see,' he answered, 
leaning over on her shoulder,  

1455
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:13,760
'I like to understand things; 
you know I always do.'

1456
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:17,840
'Oh, please be quiet!' she cried impatiently.

1457
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:24,160
So Charles sat in silence while Emma 
became more and more involved in the story  

1458
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:28,639
of the tragic heroine, a story which 
made her think about her own life.  

1459
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:33,840
As the singer came to the front of 
the stage, supported by her women,  

1460
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:39,680
white flowers in her hair, and as pale as 
death, Emma began dreaming of her own marriage.  

1461
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:45,120
She saw herself back again on the little 
footpath, when she and her father were  

1462
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:51,680
making their way to the church. Why had she not 
fought against her father, as Lucia had done?  

1463
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:59,840
Instead, she had been happy and light-hearted, 
never realizing how she was throwing herself away!

1464
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:05,920
The curtain fell at the end of the first 
act. Emma wanted to go out; the corridors  

1465
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:10,880
were crowded with people, and she sank back in 
her seat feeling as if she could not breathe.  

1466
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:16,640
Charles thought she was going to faint, and 
rushed off to the bar to get her a glass of water.  

1467
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:22,560
When he returned with the water, he also 
brought the news that he had seen Monsieur Leon.

1468
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:24,399
'Leon?'

1469
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:28,640
'The man himself! He's coming 
round in a minute to see you!'

1470
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:35,600
And before these words were out of his mouth, the 
ex-clerk from Yonville came and sat beside her.  

1471
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:42,560
He put out his hand, and Madame Bovary gave him 
hers, mechanically, as if obeying some force of  

1472
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:48,480
attraction she could not resist. She had not 
felt this hand since that spring evening when  

1473
02:24:48,479 --> 02:24:54,000
the rain was falling on the green leaves and 
they said goodbye standing beside the window.

1474
02:24:55,280 --> 02:25:00,080
'Oh, how do you do? Imagine it! You here?'

1475
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:07,200
They could not talk now, as the opera had begun 
again, but from that moment she stopped listening.  

1476
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:13,519
Everything seemed to be taking place far away, 
like the sound of music from a distant room.

1477
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:20,560
As soon as the opera had finished, all 
three of them went and sat in the open air,  

1478
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:27,440
outside a cafe. They began by talking about her 
illness, Emma interrupting Charles every now and  

1479
02:25:27,439 --> 02:25:34,000
then for fear, she said, of boring Monsieur Leon. 
Then Leon told them how he was going to spend  

1480
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:39,680
two years in a lawyer's office here in Rouen. 
He said that he needed the experience as the  

1481
02:25:39,680 --> 02:25:44,320
work in Normandy was very different from the 
kind of thing he had been doing in Paris.

1482
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:51,359
People coming away from the theatre passed along 
in front of them on the pavement, some still  

1483
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:57,200
singing the tunes from the opera. Although Leon 
had not been impressed by the leading male singer,  

1484
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:01,520
Charles (who had begun to understand 
things better towards the end of the show)  

1485
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:05,840
had appreciated his voice and said 
he would love to hear him again.

1486
02:26:07,359 --> 02:26:11,280
'Oh, well,' said Leon, 'he'll be 
giving another performance soon.'

1487
02:26:12,319 --> 02:26:14,960
But Charles replied that they 
were going home in the morning.  

1488
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:21,040
'Unless you'd like to stay a little longer 
by yourself,' he added, turning to his wife.

1489
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:28,480
When Leon saw that there was a chance Emma might 
be able to stay, he began to praise the singer,  

1490
02:26:28,479 --> 02:26:32,799
and Charles became even more certain that 
she must stay in Rouen for an extra night.

1491
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:37,360
'You can come back on Sunday. 
It's silly of you not to stay,  

1492
02:26:37,359 --> 02:26:40,160
if you feel it's doing you even 
the slightest bit of good.'

1493
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:45,760
And so it was arranged that Charles 
would return to Yonville in the morning,  

1494
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:49,920
and Leon would go to the opera with 
Madame Bovary on the following evening.

1495
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:57,359
Since leaving Yonville, 
Leon had not forgotten Emma.  

1496
02:26:58,479 --> 02:27:03,200
In Paris, he had worked at his studies and 
had not had the wild time he had imagined.  

1497
02:27:04,319 --> 02:27:09,759
It had been a happy but unexciting period, 
and he had sometimes dreamed of the love that  

1498
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:14,640
might have been between them. Seeing 
her again, after three long years,  

1499
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:21,679
all his hopes returned. This time he thought he 
really would have to bring things to a conclusion.  

1500
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:29,360
He was less shy now, more sure of himself, and 
after his time in Paris he felt quite confident  

1501
02:27:29,359 --> 02:27:34,880
that he could have his way with this country 
doctor's wife. He would not have been brave  

1502
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:39,760
enough to make the attempt in Paris, but 
away from the capital he had the courage.

1503
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:46,241
When they met the following afternoon, he did 
his best to make himself interesting to her.  

1504
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:51,120
He talked, therefore, about how unhappy 
he had been since he left Yonville,  

1505
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:53,280
and how his dreams had been disappointed.

1506
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:59,120
'If you only knew,' she said, 
'the dreams that I have dreamed.'  

1507
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:04,719
And tears shone in her beautiful eyes 
as she raised them to the ceiling.

1508
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:12,240
'And I, too!' cried Leon. 'I often 
went out, trying to lose myself in  

1509
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:16,240
the noise of the crowd, but I was never 
able to get you out of my thoughts.'

1510
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:23,120
Madame Bovary turned away her head so that he 
should not see the smile she felt on her lips.  

1511
02:28:24,319 --> 02:28:29,200
She let him speak, saying nothing, waiting 
for him to say what she wanted to hear.  

1512
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:32,080
She did not have to wait long.

1513
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:37,920
'And,' he went on, 'I wrote you so 
many letters that I never sent.'

1514
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:40,880
'But why?' she asked.

1515
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:48,240
'Why?' And he hesitated a 
moment. 'Because I loved you!'

1516
02:28:50,479 --> 02:28:55,599
Congratulating himself for having said the words, 
Leon watched her out of the corner of his eye.

1517
02:28:57,439 --> 02:29:01,120
It was like looking at the sky after 
the sun has chased away the clouds.  

1518
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:04,240
Her whole face was lit up with joy.

1519
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:11,920
He waited, and at last she said, 
'I always thought you did.'

1520
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:17,600
Then they talked about all the things that 
had happened when he lived in Yonville.  

1521
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:21,760
They spoke of the flowers in her 
garden, the dresses she used to wear,  

1522
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:25,600
the furniture in her bedroom, and of 
all the things in and around the house.  

1523
02:29:26,319 --> 02:29:31,280
They talked and talked, and before they realized 
how time had passed, it was eight o'clock.

1524
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:35,840
She rose to light the candles; 
then she came and sat down again.

1525
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,840
'Well?' said Leon, and he 
reached out and touched her hand.  

1526
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:45,920
'What could stop us from 
beginning all over again now?'

1527
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:54,160
'No, my friend,' she replied. 'I am too old... 
you are too young... Forget all about me.  

1528
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:57,600
Others will love you... and you will love them.'

1529
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:01,759
'Not as I love you,' he cried.

1530
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:07,679
'What a child you are! We have 
to be sensible! I mean it!'

1531
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:14,480
And she did mean it - she intended to keep her 
distance, to be responsible. She had suffered too  

1532
02:30:14,479 --> 02:30:22,959
much to want to open those wounds again. However, 
she was not prepared for Leon's shyness. If he had  

1533
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:27,520
been another Rodolphe, it would have been easy; 
she could have pushed him away without an effort.  

1534
02:30:28,319 --> 02:30:36,319
But Leon was so beautiful, so full of desire 
for her - she could see it in his eyes - but so  

1535
02:30:36,319 --> 02:30:42,479
gentle, she did not know what to do. When he 
took her face in his hands and kissed her,  

1536
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:47,840
she could not resist, because he did 
it without force, with such care.  

1537
02:30:49,439 --> 02:30:51,519
But still, she could not let this happen!

1538
02:30:52,479 --> 02:30:55,120
So she looked at the clock 
above the fireplace and said,  

1539
02:30:55,840 --> 02:31:00,319
'Heavens, look at the time! We have forgotten 
all about the theatre! And I must go back to  

1540
02:31:00,319 --> 02:31:04,000
my poor husband tomorrow, so 
there is my last chance gone!'

1541
02:31:05,359 --> 02:31:07,920
'Are you really going back?' said Leon.

1542
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:09,520
'I am.'

1543
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:14,400
'But I must see you again,' he said. 'I 
had something I wanted to tell you...'

1544
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:16,240
'What is it?'

1545
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:22,000
'Something... Oh, something 
very serious, very important!  

1546
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:26,639
Ah, but no! You won't go back. 
You can't. If you only knew...  

1547
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:32,000
Listen, you mustn't go like this! Let me 
see you again, I beg you. Once, just once!'

1548
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:43,440
'Well...' And she stopped. And then, as if on 
second thoughts, she said, 'Oh, no. Not here!'

1549
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:46,240
'Wherever you like.'

1550
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:50,800
'Will you...?' She seemed to be thinking.  

1551
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:55,839
Then suddenly she said, 'Tomorrow, 
at eleven, in the cathedral.'

1552
02:31:57,200 --> 02:32:00,160
'I shall be there,' he 
cried, taking both her hands.

1553
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:07,680
But that night Emma wrote a long, long 
letter, excusing herself from meeting him.  

1554
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:13,280
It was all over now, and, for their own sakes, 
it would be better for them not to meet.  

1555
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:18,800
But when the letter was sealed up, she 
realized she did not know Leon's address.

1556
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:23,840
'I will give it to him myself,' 
she said. 'He is sure to come.'

1557
02:32:26,479 --> 02:32:31,599
Leon arrived early at the cathedral, and had to 
wait in the cool shadows for what seemed like  

1558
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:37,600
hours. Suddenly, at around eleven o'clock, 
there was the sound of silk upon the stones,  

1559
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:44,080
the shadow of a hat on the wall... It 
was Emma! Leon rose and went to meet her.

1560
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:48,319
Emma was pale, and she was walking quickly.

1561
02:32:50,479 --> 02:32:55,040
'Read this!' she said, holding out a paper. 
But then, seeming to change her mind,  

1562
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:59,200
she cried out, 'Oh no! Never mind!'

1563
02:33:00,080 --> 02:33:05,680
And she quickly tore away her hand, and went out 
into the sunshine again. She did not know what  

1564
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:12,560
to do, how to go on. She wanted to be here, to be 
with him, and at the same time to fly, fly away.

1565
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:18,241
Leon followed, feeling that his love was 
in danger of disappearing like smoke.  

1566
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:24,161
Wanting to take back control of the situation 
(which he felt was slipping through his fingers),  

1567
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:29,680
he decided to hire one of the carriages 
which were waiting. They could drive away,  

1568
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:36,000
be together in this private, dark space. 
They could not go to his room, nor to hers,  

1569
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,600
so a carriage, hired for the 
day, would be their shelter.

1570
02:33:41,439 --> 02:33:45,280
'Leon, really... I don't know whether I ought.  

1571
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:48,400
It's not the proper thing 
to do. You know it isn't!'

1572
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:53,281
'Why not?' answered the 
clerk. 'It's done in Paris.'

1573
02:33:54,560 --> 02:33:56,400
Emma had no reply to this.

1574
02:33:58,080 --> 02:34:00,080
'Where to, sir?' said the driver.

1575
02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:04,960
'Wherever you like,' said 
Leon, pushing Emma inside;  

1576
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:09,680
and so they set off, first going 
down to the bridge over the river,  

1577
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:14,000
then across the main square, past the 
town hall and stopping beside a statue.

1578
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:17,280
'Keep going,' said a voice from inside.

1579
02:34:18,479 --> 02:34:24,240
The carriage started again and, following the 
downhill road after leaving the centre of town,  

1580
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:28,240
it drove at full speed into the square 
in front of the railway station.

1581
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:31,840
'No, no, straight on!' shouted the voice again.

1582
02:34:33,760 --> 02:34:37,760
The driver took them out of town through 
the big gates, down to the waterside.  

1583
02:34:38,399 --> 02:34:42,319
Along by the river the vehicle went, 
towards the little town of Oyssel.

1584
02:34:42,319 --> 02:34:47,840
And on and on went the carriage, with 
its sweating driver and tired horse.  

1585
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:52,640
Each time they stopped, the man's 
voice cried out, 'Drive on, drive on!'  

1586
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:59,920
until, at about six in the evening, the carriage 
stopped in a side street and a woman got out. She  

1587
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:04,480
walked away with her face hidden, looking 
neither to the right nor to the left.
 
 
 

1588
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:09,760
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1589
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:11,840
Love Once More

1590
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:21,680
When she got back to her hotel, Emma was shocked 
not to find the Yonville coach. The driver had  

1591
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:27,840
waited fifty-three minutes, and had at last 
set off without her. Although there was no  

1592
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:32,720
strong reason why she should go home, she had 
promised that she would be back that evening,  

1593
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:38,560
and she knew Charles would be expecting her. 
In her heart she was also feeling guilty for  

1594
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:45,040
her afternoon of love with Leon. Going home this 
evening was an easy way of making herself feel  

1595
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:51,040
better about what she had just done. So she 
threw her things into her bag, paid her bill,  

1596
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:56,319
hired a small carriage from the hotel and, 
telling the driver to drive like the wind,  

1597
02:35:56,319 --> 02:36:00,160
managed to catch up with the coach just 
as it was driving into Quincampoix.

1598
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:05,360
She had hardly sunk into her 
corner when she closed her eyes,  

1599
02:36:05,359 --> 02:36:10,479
and did not open them again till they were 
at the bottom of the hill. Some way off,  

1600
02:36:10,479 --> 02:36:15,120
she recognized her maid, Felicite, who was 
waiting for her at the entrance to the village.

1601
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:20,320
The driver pulled in to the side, and 
the maid called up to her mistress,  

1602
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:25,040
'Madame, you must go at once to 
Monsieur Homais. Something very urgent!'

1603
02:36:26,319 --> 02:36:31,040
The village was as quiet as usual, but 
when she went into Monsieur Homais' house  

1604
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:36,000
she found the pharmacist waiting for her 
with a serious expression on his face.

1605
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:41,520
'Madame, I fear I have bad news for 
you. Your father-in-law is dead!'

1606
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:46,720
In fact, Monsieur Bovary senior 
had died the previous evening  

1607
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:51,440
quite suddenly just after getting up 
from dinner. As Charles was anxious  

1608
02:36:51,439 --> 02:36:55,679
that Emma should not be upset, he had asked 
Monsieur Homais to break the news to her.  

1609
02:36:56,399 --> 02:37:02,080
He had thought it might be less of a shock if it 
came from someone outside the family. Although  

1610
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:08,559
Charles's thought was kind, Emma was not, in fact, 
greatly upset, and went immediately to her house.

1611
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:14,160
When he heard Emma knock, Charles came 
forward to greet her with open arms and said,  

1612
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:18,480
with tears in his voice, 'Ah! My dear...'

1613
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:25,760
He bent down to kiss her, but at the touch of his 
lips, the memory of her lover took hold of her  

1614
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:29,840
and she passed her hand over her 
face to hide her look of disgust.  

1615
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:37,040
Nevertheless, she managed to 
say, 'Yes, I know... I know...'

1616
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:42,080
He showed her the letter in which 
his mother told him the news.  

1617
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:49,840
Emma gave the letter back, and at dinner, out of 
politeness, pretended to have no appetite. But  

1618
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:55,440
as he encouraged her, she forced herself to eat, 
while Charles sat facing her in motionless sorrow.  

1619
02:37:56,640 --> 02:37:59,840
Every now and then he would raise 
his head and look at her sadly.  

1620
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:07,920
Once he said, 'I wish I could have seen him 
one more time!' She made no answer. Then,  

1621
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:13,840
realizing that some sort of comment was required 
of her, she asked, 'How old was your father?'

1622
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:15,360
'Fifty-eight.'

1623
02:38:16,240 --> 02:38:16,479
'Oh!'

1624
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:18,800
And that was all.

1625
02:38:20,960 --> 02:38:28,319
A quarter of an hour afterwards he added, 
'Poor mother! What will happen to her now?'

1626
02:38:28,319 --> 02:38:31,439
Emma had no idea, and made a silent gesture.

1627
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:36,479
Feeling that her silence was the 
result of sorrow at the news,  

1628
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:39,200
Charles made an effort to be more cheerful.

1629
02:38:40,399 --> 02:38:41,839
'Did you have a good time yesterday?'

1630
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:44,319
'Yes,' she replied.

1631
02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:50,240
When the table was cleared, 
neither Bovary nor Emma moved.  

1632
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:58,080
As she continued to look at him, she found that 
she could not pity him. He seemed a weak thing,  

1633
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:04,880
a poor man in every way. How could she get 
rid of him? The evening would be endless!

1634
02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:12,560
Next day Charles's mother arrived, 
and the weeping started again.  

1635
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:17,520
Emma said she had a lot of 
things to organize and went out.  

1636
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:23,680
Charles thought of his father, and he was 
surprised at feeling so affectionate towards him.  

1637
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:30,720
He had never thought he loved his father. Madame 
Bovary senior also thought of her husband. It was  

1638
02:39:30,720 --> 02:39:35,200
all over now, and even the worst of her 
days with him were pleasant memories.

1639
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:42,640
While the son thought about his lost father, Emma 
thought that only forty-eight hours earlier she  

1640
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:48,960
and Leon were together, with the world shut out, 
drowning in love, amazed by each other's beauty.  

1641
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:54,160
She tried to recover the details of 
that lost day of happiness and pleasure.  

1642
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:59,599
She would have liked to hear and see nothing 
new in order not to lose a moment of remembered  

1643
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:05,840
delight, but she found that her husbands noisy 
sorrow was driving it all from her memory.

1644
02:40:07,359 --> 02:40:11,759
The next afternoon, when all three of them 
were sitting in the garden, they saw Monsieur  

1645
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:16,720
Lheureux coming through the gate. He had heard 
of the sad event, and had come to visit them.  

1646
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:22,000
After he had expressed his sorrow 
at their loss, he said to Charles,  

1647
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:29,279
'Could I have a word in private with your 
wife? It's about that matter, er... you know!'

1648
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:33,840
Charles blushed to the roots 
of his hair as he answered,  

1649
02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:38,960
'Ah, yes... of course. Darling, do you think...?'

1650
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:42,720
She seemed to understand, and got up.

1651
02:40:44,560 --> 02:40:48,880
'It's nothing!' said Charles to his 
mother. 'Only a little household matter.'

1652
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:55,359
As soon as they were alone, Monsieur 
Lheureux began to congratulate Emma  

1653
02:40:55,359 --> 02:40:59,759
on the money she and her husband would have 
now that Monsieur Bovary's father had died.

1654
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:07,359
'And as you are well again,' he continued, 'I was 
coming to make proposals for another arrangement.'

1655
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:14,960
What he in fact proposed was that Emma should 
take over the responsibility for all the debts 'to  

1656
02:41:14,960 --> 02:41:21,359
stop her husband worrying'. Then she and Monsieur 
Lheureux would be able to settle all the details.

1657
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:25,920
She did not understand, so she said nothing.  

1658
02:41:26,880 --> 02:41:30,720
Lheureux quickly added that there were some 
things that Madame could not possibly do  

1659
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:36,720
without. For example, he would send her across a 
dozen metres of beautiful black silk for a dress.

1660
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:40,800
'The one you have on is good enough for the house,  

1661
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:45,600
but you need another one for visiting. I 
saw that straight away, when I came in.'

1662
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:54,241
He did not send the fabric; he brought it. Then 
he came back for the measurements. He kept coming  

1663
02:41:54,240 --> 02:42:01,439
back, doing everything he could to be of use, 
to make himself liked. And every time he came,  

1664
02:42:01,439 --> 02:42:05,120
he reminded her that she should be 
the one who managed the couple's legal  

1665
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:11,120
and financial affairs. He never mentioned 
the old bills, and she never let them enter  

1666
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:16,160
her head. Charles certainly had said something 
about them when she was beginning to get better,  

1667
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:21,120
but she had so many things to worry her at 
the time that she thought no more about them.

1668
02:42:22,880 --> 02:42:28,000
Moreover, she avoided starting any discussion 
about money while her mother-in-law was there.  

1669
02:42:28,960 --> 02:42:35,680
But, as soon as she had left, Emma began to amaze 
her husband with her practical good sense. They  

1670
02:42:35,680 --> 02:42:41,440
really did have to manage things better. She used 
a number of technical terms, spoke impressively  

1671
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:47,519
about planning for the future, and never missed a 
chance of exaggerating how complicated it would be  

1672
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:54,880
to make the right arrangements. Finally, she put 
in front of him one day a form which gave her  

1673
02:42:54,880 --> 02:43:01,279
the power to manage all his financial affairs. 
She had profited well from Lheureux's lessons.

1674
02:43:03,120 --> 02:43:10,080
Charles - good, simple man - asked her where 
the form came from. She told him it had  

1675
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:14,240
been written by Monsieur Guillaumin, 
the Yonville lawyer, and then added,  

1676
02:43:15,040 --> 02:43:19,120
'But I wouldn't trust him further than I 
could see him. These lawyers are nearly as  

1677
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:24,640
bad as the criminals they work with. Perhaps 
we ought to consult... No, there's no one!'

1678
02:43:26,800 --> 02:43:29,840
'What about Leon?' said Charles, thinking hard.

1679
02:43:31,279 --> 02:43:34,399
He had said exactly the 
name Emma wanted him to say.  

1680
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:40,560
Now she could suggest that it was difficult to 
explain matters by letter, and she offered to go  

1681
02:43:40,560 --> 02:43:46,960
over to Rouen and speak to him directly. Charles 
would not hear of troubling her. She insisted.  

1682
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:54,320
It was a battle of kindness. Finally, she cried, 
'Now, not another word, please! I am going!'

1683
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:59,360
'How kind you are!' he said, 
kissing her on the forehead.

1684
02:44:00,960 --> 02:44:03,840
The next morning she was 
off to Rouen in the coach,  

1685
02:44:04,479 --> 02:44:09,040
to consult Monsieur Leon. 
She stayed for three days.

1686
02:44:13,279 --> 02:44:20,559
They were three wonderful days. They stayed 
down near the harbour at the Hotel de Boulogne,  

1687
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:24,400
and there they lived, with the 
curtains closed, the doors locked,  

1688
02:44:24,399 --> 02:44:28,639
the floor covered with flowers, and 
iced drinks brought up every morning.  

1689
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:34,080
Towards evening they would take a boat and 
go and have dinner on one of the islands.  

1690
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:40,559
As they left the town, smoke rose up among 
the trees, and the red sun, reflected on the  

1691
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:47,440
oily water of the harbour, looked like blood on 
polished metal. They went down between the rows  

1692
02:44:47,439 --> 02:44:54,399
of boats, and the noises of the town grew fainter 
and fainter. When, finally, they arrived at their  

1693
02:44:54,399 --> 02:44:59,839
favourite restaurant, she untied her hat and 
they stepped out of the boat on to their island.

1694
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:07,279
They went into a small cafe with dark fishing-nets 
hung up at the door, and sat themselves down  

1695
02:45:07,279 --> 02:45:13,840
in the low-ceilinged room. They ate small 
fried fish, followed by cherries and cream,  

1696
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:19,840
and then went and sat on the grass. They kissed 
and held one another under the trees, out of view;  

1697
02:45:20,479 --> 02:45:24,879
they would have liked to live for ever in that 
little spot which, in their present happiness,  

1698
02:45:25,439 --> 02:45:32,080
they thought the most beautiful place on earth. 
They had both seen trees before, and blue sky,  

1699
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:37,040
and grass. It was not the first time they had 
heard the sound of water and the music of the wind  

1700
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:44,560
in the trees, but they had never really admired 
these things till now. It was as if nature had not  

1701
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:51,520
really existed before, or had only begun to show 
its beauty after they had satisfied their desires.

1702
02:45:54,080 --> 02:45:59,200
When it was dark, they started for home 
again. The boat kept close to the shores  

1703
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:05,200
of the little islands. They did not speak, but 
sat silently in the back of the boat, listening  

1704
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:12,800
to the water. Emma looked across at Leon. Her 
head was raised, her hands were held together,  

1705
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:20,640
her eyes raised to the sky. She was beautiful 
tonight. Then Leon put his hand on a piece  

1706
02:46:20,640 --> 02:46:25,360
of red ribbon lying in the bottom of the 
boat. The boatman took it and examined it.

1707
02:46:26,960 --> 02:46:33,760
'Ah,' he said at last, 'maybe it belongs to 
one of the people I took out a few days ago.  

1708
02:46:34,479 --> 02:46:38,319
They were having fun I can tell 
you - ladies and gentlemen,  

1709
02:46:38,319 --> 02:46:45,279
with cakes, and bottles of wine. I remember one of 
them in particular. A fine, handsome man he was,  

1710
02:46:45,279 --> 02:46:50,880
with a little moustache. Lord, he was 
funny, though! They kept on saying,  

1711
02:46:50,880 --> 02:46:57,200
"Come on, tell us another... Adolphe... 
Rodolphe..." Yes, Rodolphe, that was his name.'

1712
02:46:58,960 --> 02:47:00,800
Emma shook from head to foot.

1713
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:05,840
'What's the matter?' said Leon, moving closer.

1714
02:47:06,720 --> 02:47:10,400
'Oh, it's nothing! The 
night air is a little cool.'

1715
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:16,640
'The sort of gentleman who has plenty 
of lady friends,' added the old boatman.

1716
02:47:18,880 --> 02:47:24,640
The morning after this last dinner on the island, 
Emma had to return to Yonville, and Leon had to  

1717
02:47:24,640 --> 02:47:31,201
get back to his normal life in Rouen. However, he 
found this difficult and he started ignoring his  

1718
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:37,519
friends and not looking after his business. Every 
day he waited for her letters; he read them again  

1719
02:47:37,520 --> 02:47:42,880
and again, and he wrote back to her immediately, 
remembering every detail of their time together.  

1720
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:50,640
And unlike most memories, these did not seem 
to fade, but grew stronger. The need to see her  

1721
02:47:50,640 --> 02:47:55,840
became so great that one Saturday morning he ran 
out of his office and took the coach to Yonville.

1722
02:48:01,359 --> 02:48:05,920
When he came to the top of the hill above the 
village and, looking down over the valley,  

1723
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:11,279
saw the church tower, he felt like a man 
who has gone abroad and made his fortune  

1724
02:48:11,279 --> 02:48:13,759
and now returns to visit his native village.  

1725
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:20,640
He walked down to her house and saw that 
there was a light in the kitchen. He watched  

1726
02:48:20,640 --> 02:48:25,520
to see if he could catch sight of her shadow 
behind the curtain. But nothing could be seen.

1727
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:32,880
Madame Lefrancois met him, and could not believe 
her eyes. He had dinner in the little dining room,  

1728
02:48:32,880 --> 02:48:38,720
as in the old days, but alone. He then 
went and knocked at the doctor's door.  

1729
02:48:39,359 --> 02:48:43,839
Madame was upstairs in her bedroom, and 
did not come down for a quarter of an hour.  

1730
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:50,160
The doctor appeared delighted to see him 
and, to their regret, stayed at home all  

1731
02:48:50,160 --> 02:48:55,519
that day and the next. The only chance to 
see her alone came very late in the evening,  

1732
02:48:56,080 --> 02:49:00,880
in the lane at the end of the garden - the 
lane where she used to meet 'the other one'.  

1733
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:06,960
There was a thunderstorm and they talked under an 
umbrella, with lightning flashing all around them.

1734
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:11,840
Their separation was becoming impossible to bear.  

1735
02:49:12,880 --> 02:49:17,600
'I would rather be dead,' she said, 
holding him, with tears in her eyes.

1736
02:49:18,479 --> 02:49:22,719
'Goodbye! Goodbye! When shall I see you again?'

1737
02:49:24,319 --> 02:49:29,759
They turned back for one last kiss, and she 
promised to find some way of seeing him regularly,  

1738
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:34,960
at least once a week. She was full of hope. 
She would soon have some money to play with.

1739
02:49:36,640 --> 02:49:39,840
In fact, she was soon behaving as if 
she had all the money in the world.  

1740
02:49:41,040 --> 02:49:44,880
She bought a pair of yellow curtains for her 
bedroom, which Monsieur Lheureux had told  

1741
02:49:44,880 --> 02:49:51,440
her were a bargain. She had dreams of a carpet 
and Lheureux, saying that to want a carpet was  

1742
02:49:51,439 --> 02:49:57,359
not like wishing for the moon, helped her to 
get one. She had begun to depend on Lheureux.  

1743
02:49:58,240 --> 02:50:02,080
She sent for him twenty times a day, 
and he immediately stopped what he  

1744
02:50:02,080 --> 02:50:07,840
was doing and came to see Madame. It 
was a dangerous friendship for Emma.

1745
02:50:08,640 --> 02:50:13,280
It was about this time - around the beginning 
of winter - that she suddenly appeared to  

1746
02:50:13,279 --> 02:50:20,000
develop a tremendous enthusiasm for music. 
One night, while Charles was listening to her,  

1747
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:25,680
she began the same piece over again, stopping 
four times, finding fault with herself each time.  

1748
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:33,760
He, never noticing any difference, cried, 'Oh well 
done! Splendid! What did you stop for? Go on!'

1749
02:50:34,800 --> 02:50:39,600
'Oh, no! It's too bad! My fingers 
feel as if they were stiff with rust!'

1750
02:50:40,960 --> 02:50:43,200
Next day he begged her to play him something more.

1751
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:46,320
'Oh, well, if you want me to.'

1752
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:52,720
Charles confessed he had heard her play 
better. She kept hitting the wrong notes,  

1753
02:50:52,720 --> 02:50:54,720
and finally came to a sudden stop.

1754
02:50:56,240 --> 02:50:59,279
'Ah, it's no good! I ought 
to have some lessons, but...'  

1755
02:51:00,160 --> 02:51:05,439
She bit her lip and added, 'Twenty 
francs a time. It's too expensive!'

1756
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:12,720
'Well, yes... it is...' said Charles. 'But 
perhaps it could be managed a bit cheaper.  

1757
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:18,560
Sometimes a less well-known artist can be 
better than a teacher with a big reputation.'

1758
02:51:20,479 --> 02:51:26,479
'They are not easy to find,' said Emma, and did 
not open the piano again - although whenever she  

1759
02:51:26,479 --> 02:51:34,559
went near it (if Charles was in the room) 
she would say sadly, 'Ah, my poor piano!'

1760
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:40,800
And when she had visitors, she never failed 
to tell them she had given up her music  

1761
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:43,920
and could not now start again 
because of their lack of money.  

1762
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:51,201
And they would say what a pity it was, since 
she had such a gift. They even spoke to Charles  

1763
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:55,920
about it, especially the pharmacist, 
saying it was really too bad of him.

1764
02:51:57,359 --> 02:52:04,000
'You're making a mistake. You should never let 
a natural gift lie unused. Besides, my friend,  

1765
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:09,439
you should remember that by encouraging your wife 
to study now, you will be saving on your child's  

1766
02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:15,279
musical education later. In my opinion, children 
ought always to be taught by their own mother.'

1767
02:52:16,479 --> 02:52:19,439
So Charles again came back to this piano question.  

1768
02:52:20,640 --> 02:52:26,400
Emma replied bitterly that they might as well 
sell it, for all the good it was. But to sell  

1769
02:52:26,399 --> 02:52:31,759
this piano, something she had been so proud 
of, was an idea that Bovary could not accept.

1770
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:39,760
'Well,' he said, 'if you want a lesson 
now and again, it might be possible.'

1771
02:52:41,200 --> 02:52:46,080
'Yes,' she replied, 'but it's no good having 
lessons unless you take them regularly.'

1772
02:52:48,319 --> 02:52:53,599
That was how she managed to get permission from 
her husband to go to Rouen once a week to see  

1773
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:59,600
her lover. At the end of a month, everyone 
said that she had made a lot of progress.
 
 
 

1774
02:53:02,640 --> 02:53:03,520
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1775
02:53:04,720 --> 02:53:05,120
Debts

1776
02:53:07,279 --> 02:53:13,759
Thursday was the day. She got up and dressed 
very quietly, in order not to disturb Charles,  

1777
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:18,800
and took the early coach to Rouen, arriving 
just as the city was beginning to wake up.  

1778
02:53:20,080 --> 02:53:26,080
For fear of being seen, she usually avoided the 
main streets, going instead down narrow lanes and  

1779
02:53:26,080 --> 02:53:33,200
alleys until she reached the rue Nationale, and 
turned down a side street, and yes, there he was.

1780
02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:41,359
Leon made no sign, but continued on his way. 
She followed him until they came to the hotel.  

1781
02:53:42,319 --> 02:53:49,439
In he went and up the stairs, opened the door of 
their room and entered; and then how they kissed,  

1782
02:53:49,439 --> 02:53:54,479
and then how they talked! They spoke of all 
the worries they had had during the week,  

1783
02:53:54,479 --> 02:53:58,399
all the things they had done. 
But that was all over now,  

1784
02:53:58,399 --> 02:54:03,359
and they looked at each other with little sounds 
of delight, and words of tenderness and love.

1785
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:09,600
The bed was large, with red curtains, 
and there was nothing so beautiful in  

1786
02:54:09,600 --> 02:54:13,920
the world as her dark head and 
white skin against the dark red  

1787
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:19,840
when, with a shy little gesture, she put her 
arms together and hid her face in her hands.  

1788
02:54:21,200 --> 02:54:26,639
How they loved this room. They had their 
lunch by the fire on a little side-table.  

1789
02:54:27,920 --> 02:54:33,120
They were so completely involved in each other 
that it seemed like being in their own home,  

1790
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:38,399
and they dreamed they would continue to live 
there always. They talked about 'our room',  

1791
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:45,120
and for the first time in his life Leon tasted 
the sweetness of female company, a woman's life.

1792
02:54:47,359 --> 02:54:52,319
He knelt on the ground in front of her and, 
with his two elbows on her knees, looked  

1793
02:54:52,319 --> 02:54:58,000
at her with a smile, leaning his face towards 
her. And she leaned down to him, and whispered,  

1794
02:54:59,120 --> 02:55:06,800
'Oh, don't move! Don't speak! Look at me! There 
is something in your eyes so sweet - it does me  

1795
02:55:06,800 --> 02:55:11,680
so much good.' And she called 
him 'child': 'Do you love me,  

1796
02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:17,440
child?' And she hardly heard his reply, so 
wildly did he press his lips to her mouth.

1797
02:55:18,960 --> 02:55:24,960
At the end of their day she would say, 
'Goodbye till Thursday! Thursday!'

1798
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:29,600
Then suddenly she would seize 
his head in both her hands,  

1799
02:55:29,600 --> 02:55:34,960
kiss him quickly on the forehead and, 
crying 'Goodbye', run down the stairs.

1800
02:55:36,720 --> 02:55:41,440
Charles would be at home and waiting 
for her and, at last, Madame arrived.  

1801
02:55:42,720 --> 02:55:47,200
She hardly looked at her child and, if 
dinner was late, did not criticize the  

1802
02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:53,519
cook. Often her husband, seeing how pale 
she was, asked her if she was feeling ill.

1803
02:55:54,880 --> 02:55:56,160
'No,' said Emma.

1804
02:55:57,520 --> 02:56:00,880
'But,' he answered, 'you seem so strange tonight.'

1805
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,720
'Oh, no! It's nothing. I'm all right.'

1806
02:56:06,560 --> 02:56:10,960
But her whole life had become a 
lie, in which her love for Leon  

1807
02:56:10,960 --> 02:56:17,600
lay hidden from the world. Lying became a 
necessary part of her day, almost a hobby.

1808
02:56:21,920 --> 02:56:26,000
One day, however, Monsieur Lheureux 
met her in Rouen as she was coming  

1809
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:30,800
out of the Hotel de Boulogne with Leon; 
it gave her a shock, and she thought he  

1810
02:56:30,800 --> 02:56:38,720
would tell everyone. He was not such a fool. 
But three days later he came into her room,  

1811
02:56:38,720 --> 02:56:43,200
shut the door behind him and said, 
'I need some money, and soon.'

1812
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:47,120
She told him she could not let him have any.  

1813
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:51,279
Lheureux reminded her how 
helpful he had always been  

1814
02:56:51,279 --> 02:56:57,040
and pulled out of his pocket an account of goods 
not paid for - more than two thousand francs.

1815
02:56:58,240 --> 02:56:59,200
She lowered her head.

1816
02:57:00,560 --> 02:57:06,081
'But if you haven't got cash, you've got 
property,' and he mentioned a farm near Aumale  

1817
02:57:06,080 --> 02:57:09,359
that Charles had inherited 
from his father. Lheureux  

1818
02:57:09,359 --> 02:57:13,359
knew everything - how big the farm 
was, how much rent it was worth.

1819
02:57:14,960 --> 02:57:21,840
'If I were you,' he said, 'I would pay my debts, 
and there would still be some money left over.'

1820
02:57:22,560 --> 02:57:27,201
He came back the following week, saying that 
after a lot of trouble he had found a buyer  

1821
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:32,960
willing to pay four thousand francs for the farm. 
Emma was happier than she had been for months.  

1822
02:57:34,080 --> 02:57:39,120
But Lheureux shook his head and told her how much 
richer she would be if she let him manage these  

1823
02:57:39,120 --> 02:57:45,519
affairs. Finally he persuaded her to borrow 
even more money from him and to sign a series  

1824
02:57:45,520 --> 02:57:51,440
of documents which she did not understand. 
He told her this would give her more cash  

1825
02:57:51,439 --> 02:57:56,719
now - cash she could use to pay her other debts 
and buy some of the little things she wanted.  

1826
02:57:57,760 --> 02:58:01,680
Emma, with her mind full of thoughts of 
Leon and what they could do together,  

1827
02:58:02,399 --> 02:58:08,719
did not even read the papers, but simply signed 
her name where Lheureux placed his dirty finger.  

1828
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:14,000
With this money in her hands, she 
felt she might begin to be free.

1829
02:58:16,160 --> 02:58:21,840
Freedom, however, was a disappointment. 
Despite her hopes, she now found Leon  

1830
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:28,240
less pleased to meet her than before, less in 
love. Because she had more money in her pocket  

1831
02:58:28,240 --> 02:58:33,040
she made more demands on him, but his 
employer was worried about his work,  

1832
02:58:33,040 --> 02:58:38,560
and his friends asked him why they could no 
longer see him. And the more Emma demanded,  

1833
02:58:38,560 --> 02:58:44,400
the less Leon wanted to give, and while 
her love, her need continued to grow,  

1834
02:58:44,399 --> 02:58:52,399
so did her anger. In the end, she brought roses 
for him from Yonville and threw them in his face.

1835
02:58:55,120 --> 02:59:02,160
So Emma was not happy. Why was there this 
emptiness in her life? Why did whatever she  

1836
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:10,639
want turn into dust? Everything was a lie, every 
smile hid a bored yawn; every promise hid a curse.

1837
02:59:12,880 --> 02:59:18,160
To make matters worse, one day a small, 
red-faced man came to the house explaining  

1838
02:59:18,160 --> 02:59:23,519
that he came from a Monsieur Vincart of 
Rouen. He politely handed her a paper.  

1839
02:59:24,399 --> 02:59:28,160
It was a bill for seven 
hundred francs, signed by her.  

1840
02:59:29,200 --> 02:59:35,920
Lheureux had sold her bills to a money-lender! 
She sent the servant to fetch him. He was busy  

1841
02:59:35,920 --> 02:59:41,840
and could not come, and the stranger asked 
what reply he should take to Monsieur Vincart.

1842
02:59:42,399 --> 02:59:46,080
'Well,' said Emma, 'tell him I haven't got it...  

1843
02:59:46,080 --> 02:59:51,279
It will have to be next week. Ask him 
to wait... Yes, next week, tell him.'

1844
02:59:52,560 --> 02:59:55,840
The man left without another word.

1845
02:59:56,479 --> 03:00:00,959
Next day, at twelve o'clock, a 
legal document was handed to her,  

1846
03:00:00,960 --> 03:00:04,080
and the sight of the piece of paper 
with the government stamp on it,  

1847
03:00:04,080 --> 03:00:11,040
and the name 'Maitre Hareng, Bailiff at Buchy,' 
written on it in big letters, scared her so much  

1848
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:14,479
that she ran without a moment's 
delay to Monsieur Lheureux's shop.

1849
03:00:15,840 --> 03:00:18,319
She found him there, tying up a big parcel.

1850
03:00:19,120 --> 03:00:24,880
'What can we do for Madame today?' he asked, and 
he showed Madame upstairs to his little office.

1851
03:00:26,560 --> 03:00:31,121
'What's the matter?' said Lheureux, 
seating himself in his big armchair.

1852
03:00:33,040 --> 03:00:35,600
'Look at that.' And she showed him the paper.

1853
03:00:37,520 --> 03:00:38,720
'Well, what can I do?'

1854
03:00:40,319 --> 03:00:44,960
This made her more angry than frightened. 
Hadn't he promised not to sell her bills?  

1855
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:51,840
He agreed that he had but added, 'I had 
no choice. I had a knife at my throat.'

1856
03:00:53,120 --> 03:00:54,319
'What's going to happen now?'

1857
03:00:55,520 --> 03:01:00,081
'Oh, I'll tell you what will happen; 
that's easy. You go before the judge,  

1858
03:01:00,080 --> 03:01:04,080
you pay or they sell your 
things. It's quite simple.'

1859
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:07,600
Though Emma wanted to hit him,  

1860
03:01:07,600 --> 03:01:12,241
she asked him sweetly if there was anything 
she could do to keep this Vincart quiet.

1861
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:18,240
'Oh, no! Keep Vincart quiet! You don't 
know much about him, that's clear.  

1862
03:01:18,960 --> 03:01:21,200
He's more bloodthirsty than a tiger!'

1863
03:01:22,399 --> 03:01:25,759
Emma cried out that Monsieur Lheureux 
really would have to do something.

1864
03:01:27,279 --> 03:01:31,439
'I think I've been pretty good 
to you! Look at this,' he said,  

1865
03:01:31,439 --> 03:01:38,559
opening a record book and running his finger up 
the page. 'Here... and again, here... 3 August,  

1866
03:01:38,560 --> 03:01:47,840
two hundred francs... 17 June, a hundred and 
fifty... 23 March, forty-six. In April...'  

1867
03:01:49,120 --> 03:01:54,720
He stopped. 'Anyway, I've had enough 
of these delays, and that's that!'

1868
03:01:55,920 --> 03:02:01,840
Emma said no more. What could she do?

1869
03:02:02,560 --> 03:02:05,440
When she went to Rouen, Leon 
gave her little comfort.  

1870
03:02:06,640 --> 03:02:10,960
He had just heard that he was going to be 
promoted to chief clerk in his law firm.  

1871
03:02:10,960 --> 03:02:17,359
It was time for him to think about his future. 
No more love-making! Besides, it rather bored  

1872
03:02:17,359 --> 03:02:22,399
him now when Emma began weeping on his chest, 
and he had grown tired of so much emotion.  

1873
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:27,680
Feeling him withdraw from her, she now began 
to wonder how she could get rid of him!  

1874
03:02:28,319 --> 03:02:32,719
She even began to wish that something terrible 
would happen which would force them to separate.  

1875
03:02:33,760 --> 03:02:39,600
She stopped her excuse of music lessons, and 
her visits to Rouen. She stayed in her room, too  

1876
03:02:39,600 --> 03:02:45,840
depressed to pay attention when more legal demands 
for money came to the house, too depressed to talk  

1877
03:02:45,840 --> 03:02:52,800
to her husband or her child. She would have liked 
to stop living or else to go on sleeping for ever.

1878
03:02:54,640 --> 03:02:59,440
However, she could not stop the world coming 
to her, and one morning, two weeks after  

1879
03:02:59,439 --> 03:03:04,639
the first visit by Vincart's man, Felicite 
brought her a piece of grey-coloured paper.  

1880
03:03:05,760 --> 03:03:11,200
She took it and read the complicated legal 
language which told her the simple truth  

1881
03:03:11,200 --> 03:03:17,040
that within twenty-four hours she had to pay 
the total amount of eight thousand francs.  

1882
03:03:18,319 --> 03:03:21,759
Lower down, she read the words which 
told her that if she did not do this,  

1883
03:03:22,479 --> 03:03:31,200
all her household goods would be sold! What could 
she do? Twenty-four hours! That meant tomorrow.  

1884
03:03:31,840 --> 03:03:35,760
Maybe Lheureux was just trying to frighten 
her, that's what it was! She went to see him.

1885
03:03:36,560 --> 03:03:39,840
'Do you know what's happening?' 
she said. 'I suppose it's a joke.'

1886
03:03:41,120 --> 03:03:41,680
'It isn't.'

1887
03:03:42,399 --> 03:03:43,040
'What do you mean?'

1888
03:03:44,880 --> 03:03:52,080
He turned to her slowly and then, folding his 
arms, said, 'Did you think, my little lady, that  

1889
03:03:52,080 --> 03:03:58,559
I would keep on supplying you with goods and money 
for ever, simply for the love of it? Be fair!  

1890
03:03:59,200 --> 03:04:06,080
I must recover my money one way or the 
other. Anyway, it's not me, it's Vincart.'

1891
03:04:07,760 --> 03:04:09,120
'Couldn't you possibly...?'

1892
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:11,600
'I can't do anything.'

1893
03:04:12,720 --> 03:04:15,200
'But... just look at it like this...'  

1894
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:21,920
And she began to say she had not 
known... it had taken her by surprise...

1895
03:04:21,920 --> 03:04:26,640
She begged and prayed, she even put 
her white hand on Lheureux's knee.

1896
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:33,120
'That's enough of that!' he shouted. 'Anyone 
would think you were trying to make love to me.'

1897
03:04:34,080 --> 03:04:35,840
'You horrible man!'

1898
03:04:36,479 --> 03:04:40,719
'Well, who's got a temper?' he said, with a laugh.

1899
03:04:41,680 --> 03:04:44,960
'I'll tell everyone what you've 
done. I'll tell my husband...'

1900
03:04:46,080 --> 03:04:50,080
'All right, but I don't think 
your husband will be very pleased  

1901
03:04:50,080 --> 03:04:52,800
when he understands what you've been doing!'

1902
03:04:54,160 --> 03:04:57,120
She fell back, as if someone 
had hit her in the face.

1903
03:04:58,399 --> 03:05:05,920
And then he went close up to her, saying sweetly, 
'It's not very pleasant, I know. But, after all,  

1904
03:05:05,920 --> 03:05:12,319
it never killed anybody, and it seems that it's 
the only way to make you pay me back my money...'

1905
03:05:13,680 --> 03:05:15,920
'But where can I get it?' said Emma.

1906
03:05:16,800 --> 03:05:19,200
'What about all those friends of yours?'

1907
03:05:20,319 --> 03:05:26,080
And he gave her a look so searching and 
so terrible that she shook with fear.

1908
03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:32,960
'I promise you,' she said. 'I'll sign any...'

1909
03:05:33,520 --> 03:05:35,920
'I've had enough of you and your signatures!'

1910
03:05:37,120 --> 03:05:38,559
'And I can still sell...'

1911
03:05:39,120 --> 03:05:43,599
'Don't be a fool,' he said. 
'You've got nothing left to sell!'

1912
03:05:44,720 --> 03:05:48,960
'But if I brought you three thousand francs, 
a quarter, a third, nearly all of it?'

1913
03:05:49,680 --> 03:05:51,600
'No, it's no good.'

1914
03:05:52,800 --> 03:05:54,800
He pushed her gently towards the stairs.

1915
03:05:56,000 --> 03:06:01,120
'I beg you, Monsieur Lheureux, give me a 
few days longer!' and she burst into tears.

1916
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,479
'Oh look, more tears!'

1917
03:06:05,279 --> 03:06:06,240
'But I'm desperate!'

1918
03:06:07,359 --> 03:06:13,839
'I don't care,' he whispered in her ear, 
so close she could smell his sour breath,  

1919
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:16,080
and then he shut the door.
 
 
 

1920
03:06:20,399 --> 03:06:21,359
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1921
03:06:22,880 --> 03:06:23,440
A Death

1922
03:06:26,720 --> 03:06:33,120
She was brave next day, when Maitre Hareng, the 
bailiff, accompanied by two witnesses, came to  

1923
03:06:33,120 --> 03:06:39,519
make a list of the goods to be sold. They began 
with Charles's consulting room, then went into the  

1924
03:06:39,520 --> 03:06:45,760
kitchen and bedroom. They examined her dresses, 
they searched through her dressing room - and her  

1925
03:06:45,760 --> 03:06:52,080
whole way of life, with all its little secrets, 
was laid bare, like a body on an operating table.

1926
03:06:53,760 --> 03:06:59,200
Maitre Hareng, with his black coat buttoned up 
to the neck, his white tie and polished boots,  

1927
03:06:59,200 --> 03:07:06,160
would say from time to time, 'Pardon me, 
Madame; will you allow me?' And he frequently  

1928
03:07:06,160 --> 03:07:13,200
made little comments, such as, 'Charming! Very 
pretty!' Then he would make some more notes.

1929
03:07:14,960 --> 03:07:18,240
When they had gone through the rooms, 
they went up to the room under the roof.  

1930
03:07:18,880 --> 03:07:23,840
She had a desk up there in which she kept 
Rodolphe's letters. That had to be opened.

1931
03:07:25,600 --> 03:07:29,920
'Ah, letters!' said Maitre 
Hareng, smiling politely.  

1932
03:07:30,880 --> 03:07:35,200
'But allow me. I must make sure 
the box contains nothing else.'

1933
03:07:36,479 --> 03:07:39,120
At last they went and Felicite returned.  

1934
03:07:39,760 --> 03:07:42,880
Emma had sent her to look out 
for Charles and keep him away.

1935
03:07:45,200 --> 03:07:50,479
Charles that evening seemed rather worried. 
She looked at him, then at the curtains,  

1936
03:07:50,479 --> 03:07:55,839
the chairs, all the things which had made her a 
little happier, but which would now ruin them.

1937
03:07:58,160 --> 03:08:01,920
The next day, Emma went to Rouen 
to see if she could find a way out.  

1938
03:08:02,720 --> 03:08:07,120
She visited every banker she knew the name 
of. Some of them laughed in her face when  

1939
03:08:07,120 --> 03:08:13,920
they heard her story. All of them refused. 
At two o'clock, she ran to Leon's office.  

1940
03:08:13,920 --> 03:08:20,319
She knocked at the door, but no one 
came. At last Leon himself appeared.

1941
03:08:20,319 --> 03:08:24,000
'I've something I must say to 
you,' she said. She was very pale.  

1942
03:08:25,279 --> 03:08:30,399
'Leon,' she said, 'I want you to do 
something for me.' Then, taking him  

1943
03:08:30,399 --> 03:08:36,559
with her two hands and giving him a shake, she 
said, 'Listen, I want eight thousand francs.'

1944
03:08:37,760 --> 03:08:39,760
'What? You're mad!'

1945
03:08:41,040 --> 03:08:41,760
'Not yet.'

1946
03:08:42,720 --> 03:08:44,640
And she told the story of what had happened,  

1947
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:51,519
how she had let Lheureux lead her into disaster. 
And Charles knew nothing. She must have the money.

1948
03:08:52,880 --> 03:08:53,920
'How do you expect me...?'

1949
03:08:54,960 --> 03:09:01,840
And her lover would do nothing to 
help her. She had nowhere to turn to.

1950
03:09:01,840 --> 03:09:05,040
'What must be must be!' she said to herself.

1951
03:09:10,720 --> 03:09:15,600
She was woken at nine the next morning by 
voices in the square. There was a crowd  

1952
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:20,720
of people outside, all trying to read a big 
piece of paper stuck to the wall of her house.

1953
03:09:20,720 --> 03:09:26,560
'Madame! Madame!' cried Felicite, 
rushing in. 'It's a terrible shame!'

1954
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:32,479
And the poor girl held out a yellow paper 
which she had just torn off the front door.  

1955
03:09:33,520 --> 03:09:36,640
Emma read that all her furniture was to be sold.  

1956
03:09:37,600 --> 03:09:43,840
They looked at each other in silence. Servant 
and mistress had no secrets from one another.

1957
03:09:46,239 --> 03:09:51,920
'If I were you, Madame,' sighed Felicite at 
last, 'I would go and see Monsieur Guillaumin.'

1958
03:09:52,960 --> 03:09:53,520
'You would?'

1959
03:09:54,640 --> 03:09:57,840
'Yes, you go. That's the right thing to do.'

1960
03:09:59,680 --> 03:10:02,480
She dressed and, in order not to be seen  

1961
03:10:03,120 --> 03:10:07,439
(there were always a lot of people in the 
square), she took the path by the river.

1962
03:10:10,080 --> 03:10:13,439
'Monsieur,' she said, after she was 
let into the lawyer's dining room,  

1963
03:10:14,319 --> 03:10:17,840
'I want to ask you...' And 
she told him her situation.

1964
03:10:20,160 --> 03:10:26,080
Maitre Guillaumin knew all about it. In fact, 
he was a secret friend of Lheureux's, and knew  

1965
03:10:26,080 --> 03:10:32,160
the story better than she did herself. As 
he listened, he smiled a strange smile.  

1966
03:10:33,600 --> 03:10:38,080
When she asked him for help with the money 
that was being demanded, he said how sad  

1967
03:10:38,080 --> 03:10:44,399
he was that she had never come to him before. 
Then he put out his hand and took hold of hers,  

1968
03:10:44,960 --> 03:10:50,800
and kissed it greedily, playing with her fingers 
and looking in her face with his colourless eyes.  

1969
03:10:52,239 --> 03:10:55,359
She felt his breath on her 
cheek and could not bear it.

1970
03:10:56,960 --> 03:11:01,279
She jumped to her feet. 'Monsieur,' 
she said, 'I am waiting.'

1971
03:11:02,319 --> 03:11:05,840
'What for?' said the lawyer, 
suddenly going as white as a sheet.

1972
03:11:06,720 --> 03:11:07,840
'This money.'

1973
03:11:08,560 --> 03:11:08,800
'But...'

1974
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:12,880
Then, giving in to a desire 
he could not resist, he said,  

1975
03:11:14,560 --> 03:11:16,800
'Very well, yes! You can have your money!'

1976
03:11:17,439 --> 03:11:23,599
And he dragged himself along on his knees towards 
her, shouting, 'For God's sake, stay! I love you!'

1977
03:11:24,479 --> 03:11:29,919
He took her by the waist. Madame Bovary fell back 
with a terrible expression on her face, crying,  

1978
03:11:30,479 --> 03:11:36,719
'I know I have fallen, Monsieur, but I am not to 
be sold.' And she turned and ran from the house.

1979
03:11:38,720 --> 03:11:40,960
Felicite was waiting for her on the doorstep.

1980
03:11:42,319 --> 03:11:43,679
'Well?' she asked.

1981
03:11:44,960 --> 03:11:46,480
'No!' said Emma.

1982
03:11:47,520 --> 03:11:51,760
And for the next quarter of an hour they went 
together through the names of all the people in  

1983
03:11:51,760 --> 03:11:57,920
Yonville who might perhaps help her. But every 
time Felicite mentioned a name Emma answered,  

1984
03:11:58,800 --> 03:12:03,840
'Do you really think so? Oh, 
no, I'm sure they wouldn't.'

1985
03:12:03,840 --> 03:12:05,920
'And the Doctor will be here in a minute or two.'

1986
03:12:06,800 --> 03:12:09,279
'Yes, I know that... Leave me alone.'

1987
03:12:11,600 --> 03:12:17,600
Rodolphe! She had to see Rodolphe. He 
would help her, but what should she say,  

1988
03:12:17,600 --> 03:12:23,840
how should she begin? Emma entered the park 
by the side gate, and walked to the house.  

1989
03:12:24,720 --> 03:12:26,800
She climbed the stairs and went to his room.  

1990
03:12:27,760 --> 03:12:32,480
He was sitting in front of the fire, with his 
feet up on the fireplace, just lighting a pipe.

1991
03:12:34,080 --> 03:12:37,760
'Hello! Is that you?' he said, getting up quickly.

1992
03:12:39,359 --> 03:12:42,719
'Yes, it's me. Rodolphe, I 
want to ask your advice.'

1993
03:12:43,920 --> 03:12:46,960
'You haven't changed, you 
are as charming as ever.'

1994
03:12:48,479 --> 03:12:54,239
'Ah,' she answered bitterly, 'sad charms. 
You said goodbye to them easily enough!  

1995
03:12:55,040 --> 03:12:59,840
Oh, Rodolphe!' she sighed. 'If 
you only knew... I loved you so!'

1996
03:13:01,439 --> 03:13:04,479
'You've been crying!' he said. 'Why is that?'

1997
03:13:05,600 --> 03:13:07,920
Now she began to weep uncontrollably.  

1998
03:13:09,359 --> 03:13:14,399
'I am ruined, Rodolphe! I want you 
to lend me three thousand francs.'

1999
03:13:15,439 --> 03:13:16,639
'But... but...'

2000
03:13:18,479 --> 03:13:25,200
Hurrying over her words, she told him her story, 
to which he listened carefully. When she had  

2001
03:13:25,200 --> 03:13:32,800
finished, he looked sadly at her and replied, 
very calmly, 'I haven't got it, dear lady.'

2002
03:13:34,399 --> 03:13:38,799
It was no lie. If he had had it, 
he would have given it to her.  

2003
03:13:40,160 --> 03:13:42,160
She stood for a few minutes looking at him.

2004
03:13:43,760 --> 03:13:46,960
'You haven't got it? Haven't got it?'

2005
03:13:48,560 --> 03:13:51,760
She repeated it several times, then she went out.

2006
03:13:55,439 --> 03:13:59,679
The walls seemed to be shaking, and she 
felt that the ceiling would fall on her.  

2007
03:14:00,720 --> 03:14:04,720
When she was outside, she felt a 
little better, but all her memories,  

2008
03:14:04,720 --> 03:14:10,720
all her ideas seemed to fill her head and burst 
in a single flash. She felt she was going mad.

2009
03:14:12,800 --> 03:14:20,239
Night was falling, and dark birds were flying into 
the trees. The sky seemed full of balls of fire,  

2010
03:14:20,239 --> 03:14:28,080
falling slowly to earth, turning and turning. 
What could she do? How could she face the world?  

2011
03:14:29,600 --> 03:14:36,000
She went running down the hill, through the market 
place and into the pharmacist's shop. The door was  

2012
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:41,680
open and no one was there, though she could hear 
Justin, the assistant, talking to Monsieur Homais.

2013
03:14:43,040 --> 03:14:50,080
She entered the passage where the laboratory door 
was. On the wall hung a key labelled 'Room 6'.  

2014
03:14:50,960 --> 03:14:55,600
It turned in the lock, and she went straight 
over and reached up to the third shelf,  

2015
03:14:56,239 --> 03:14:58,719
knocking over a small bowl 
which had stood beside it.

2016
03:15:00,720 --> 03:15:02,800
'Is anyone there? Who is that?'

2017
03:15:04,160 --> 03:15:06,399
She could hear Justin walking down the corridor.  

2018
03:15:07,279 --> 03:15:12,800
She must be quicker. She read the labels, her eyes 
desperately searching for one particular bottle,  

2019
03:15:12,800 --> 03:15:16,480
a bottle which might give her a way 
out of this impossible situation.

2020
03:15:17,600 --> 03:15:19,840
'Is there anyone there?'

2021
03:15:20,560 --> 03:15:26,081
She took down a blue jar with a small, 
hand-written label on it, pulled off the lid,  

2022
03:15:26,080 --> 03:15:29,920
and pushed her hand inside. She took it out full  

2023
03:15:29,920 --> 03:15:33,840
of a white powder which she 
began to eat then and there.

2024
03:15:34,720 --> 03:15:36,560
Justin ran into the room.

2025
03:15:36,560 --> 03:15:40,000
'Stop!' cried the boy, terrified, 
throwing himself on her.

2026
03:15:40,560 --> 03:15:45,280
'Be quiet, they'll come! They will blame 
your master for not locking his room.'

2027
03:15:46,640 --> 03:15:53,040
Then she left. They could do nothing to her 
now, and she felt a great peace in her heart.

2028
03:15:55,040 --> 03:15:58,720
Charles had come back to the house just 
after Emma left it to find Rodolphe.  

2029
03:15:59,760 --> 03:16:05,840
He did not know what to do. He sent Felicite 
to the Homais', the Tuvaches', Lheureux's,  

2030
03:16:05,840 --> 03:16:11,120
the Lion d'Or, everywhere. Whenever 
anxiety for his wife lifted for a moment,  

2031
03:16:11,120 --> 03:16:21,279
he saw his own life ruined, his money gone, 
Berthe's future destroyed. How? Why? Not a word.  

2032
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:28,800
He waited until six o'clock in the evening. 
Then, unable to stand it any longer, he went  

2033
03:16:28,800 --> 03:16:34,960
out along the road for a couple of kilometres, 
saw no one, waited, and then came back again.

2034
03:16:36,479 --> 03:16:37,359
She had come home.

2035
03:16:39,200 --> 03:16:43,840
'What was the matter? Why? Tell me all about it.'

2036
03:16:46,160 --> 03:16:52,880
She sat down at her desk and wrote a letter, which 
she slowly closed, adding the date and the hour.  

2037
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:57,840
Then she said, 'You will read that tomorrow.  

2038
03:16:58,800 --> 03:17:05,440
Until then, I beg you, do not ask me 
a single question... No, not one!'

2039
03:17:06,800 --> 03:17:07,120
'But...'

2040
03:17:08,080 --> 03:17:09,600
'Oh, leave me!'

2041
03:17:10,399 --> 03:17:16,559
And she lay down on her bed and seemed to fall 
asleep. She felt a bitter taste in her mouth,  

2042
03:17:16,560 --> 03:17:24,081
and it woke her up. She caught sight of Charles, 
and shut her eyes again. She tried to keep awake,  

2043
03:17:24,080 --> 03:17:31,040
wondering whether she had any pain. But 
no, nothing yet. She could hear the clock,  

2044
03:17:31,040 --> 03:17:36,960
the sound of the fire. Charles was standing by 
the bed, and she heard the sound of his breathing.

2045
03:17:39,040 --> 03:17:46,880
'Ah, it's nothing very much - dying!' 
she thought. 'I shall just fall asleep,  

2046
03:17:46,880 --> 03:17:48,160
and it will all be over.'

2047
03:17:50,160 --> 03:17:54,319
She drank some water and 
turned her face to the wall.

2048
03:17:54,319 --> 03:17:57,759
But there was still that horrible 
taste of ink in her mouth.

2049
03:17:59,279 --> 03:18:04,239
'I'm thirsty... oh, I'm so thirsty!' she sighed.

2050
03:18:05,200 --> 03:18:09,200
'What can it be?' said Charles, 
bringing her a glass of water.

2051
03:18:10,960 --> 03:18:15,279
'It's nothing... Open the 
window... I can't breathe.'

2052
03:18:16,800 --> 03:18:18,880
And she began to vomit so suddenly  

2053
03:18:18,880 --> 03:18:21,840
that she hardly had time to take her 
handkerchief from under her pillow.

2054
03:18:23,439 --> 03:18:29,279
He questioned her. She did not answer. She kept 
perfectly still, for fear the slightest movement  

2055
03:18:29,279 --> 03:18:36,080
would make her vomit again. And she began to feel 
an icy coldness rising from her feet to her heart.

2056
03:18:37,560 --> 03:18:41,040
'Ah, it's beginning now!' she whispered.

2057
03:18:42,319 --> 03:18:43,200
'What did you say?'

2058
03:18:45,200 --> 03:18:50,080
She kept moving her head gently from side 
to side, opening and shutting her jaws,  

2059
03:18:50,720 --> 03:18:57,680
as if she had something very heavy on her tongue. 
At eight o'clock the vomiting began again.

2060
03:18:59,279 --> 03:19:03,840
Charles, examining the basin, noticed 
something white at the bottom.

2061
03:19:05,200 --> 03:19:09,359
'That's extraordinary, most unusual!' he said.

2062
03:19:11,200 --> 03:19:15,040
'No, no, you're wrong,' she 
replied in a strong voice.

2063
03:19:16,239 --> 03:19:20,000
Then, very lightly, he passed 
his hand over her stomach.  

2064
03:19:20,880 --> 03:19:24,640
She gave a horrible scream. 
He stepped back, terrified.

2065
03:19:25,760 --> 03:19:30,000
Then she began to shake and became paler 
than the sheet that she was holding.  

2066
03:19:30,720 --> 03:19:34,560
Her heartbeat was irregular. There 
were drops of sweat on her face.  

2067
03:19:35,120 --> 03:19:41,279
Her eyes stared without seeing, and she answered 
every question with a shake of her head. She even  

2068
03:19:41,279 --> 03:19:47,519
smiled two or three times. Gradually her breathing 
became noisier. Then she started to scream.

2069
03:19:48,479 --> 03:19:49,759
'Oh, God, it's terrible!'

2070
03:19:50,960 --> 03:19:53,279
He threw himself on his knees at her bedside.

2071
03:19:54,479 --> 03:19:57,519
'Tell me! What have you 
eaten? For God's sake, speak!'  

2072
03:19:58,479 --> 03:20:02,399
And he looked at her with a tenderness in 
his eyes that she had never seen before.

2073
03:20:04,080 --> 03:20:08,800
'All right - over there... 
there!' she said weakly.

2074
03:20:10,080 --> 03:20:13,840
He ran to the writing-table, tore 
open the letter, and read aloud:  

2075
03:20:14,960 --> 03:20:20,880
'Let no one be blamed...' He stopped, passed 
his hand across his eyes and then read on.

2076
03:20:22,319 --> 03:20:32,160
'What!... Help! Help me!' And all he could 
say was the word, 'Poisoned, poisoned!'

2077
03:20:36,800 --> 03:20:41,840
Felicite ran to Monsieur Homais' shop and he came 
back as soon as he heard what was the matter.

2078
03:20:42,800 --> 03:20:46,160
'Be calm,' said the pharmacist. 
'What is the poison?'

2079
03:20:47,520 --> 03:20:51,840
Charles showed him the letter and the 
pharmacist realized there was little to be done.

2080
03:20:53,680 --> 03:20:56,080
Emma saw the two of them and looked at Charles.

2081
03:20:57,840 --> 03:21:03,120
'Don't cry,' she said, 'I will not 
be here to worry you much longer.'

2082
03:21:04,560 --> 03:21:07,680
'Why did you do it? Who made you do it?'

2083
03:21:09,520 --> 03:21:14,240
And she replied, 'It had to be, my dear.'

2084
03:21:16,399 --> 03:21:21,120
'Weren't you happy? Was it my 
fault? I did everything I could.'

2085
03:21:22,560 --> 03:21:27,360
'Yes, you did... You are kind, so kind.'

2086
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:31,200
And she passed her fingers 
slowly through his hair.

2087
03:21:32,960 --> 03:21:37,840
'Bring the little one to me,' she 
said, raising herself on her elbow.

2088
03:21:39,840 --> 03:21:43,040
'The pain isn't getting any 
worse, is it?' asked Charles.

2089
03:21:44,800 --> 03:21:45,040
'No!'

2090
03:21:46,960 --> 03:21:53,200
The child came in, in her long nightdress. 
She looked thoughtful and not yet fully  

2091
03:21:53,200 --> 03:21:59,279
awake. She opened big, wondering eyes when 
she saw the room, and the bright candles.

2092
03:22:00,800 --> 03:22:08,880
'Oh, Mummy, how big your eyes are! How 
pale you are! And your face is all sweaty!'

2093
03:22:10,560 --> 03:22:12,240
Her mother was staring at her.

2094
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:16,560
'I'm frightened,' cried the little one.

2095
03:22:17,920 --> 03:22:22,239
Emma took her hand and tried to kiss 
it; she struggled to free herself.

2096
03:22:23,520 --> 03:22:26,800
'That's enough! Take her away!' cried Charles.

2097
03:22:28,960 --> 03:22:35,439
After that Emma seemed a little better, but then 
she began to vomit blood, her limbs became stiff,  

2098
03:22:35,439 --> 03:22:42,399
her body was covered with brown patches, and her 
heartbeat raced. Then she began to scream again.  

2099
03:22:42,399 --> 03:22:46,000
She cursed the poison, she begged 
it to hurry up and finish its work.  

2100
03:22:46,560 --> 03:22:49,280
She pushed away everything that 
Charles tried to make her drink.  

2101
03:22:49,840 --> 03:22:55,440
He was standing stiffly by the bed, his whole 
body shaking from head to foot. Felicite ran  

2102
03:22:55,439 --> 03:23:01,839
from one end of the room to the other. There was 
nothing to be done except to call the priest.

2103
03:23:03,279 --> 03:23:07,040
When he came, Emma was lying 
with her chin sunk on her breast;  

2104
03:23:07,840 --> 03:23:11,600
her eyes were staring and her 
poor hands picked at the sheets.  

2105
03:23:12,880 --> 03:23:19,680
Pale as death, with eyes like burning coals, 
Charles - not crying now - was standing facing  

2106
03:23:19,680 --> 03:23:25,440
her at the foot of the bed, while the priest, 
resting on one knee, was whispering his prayers.  

2107
03:23:27,520 --> 03:23:32,640
Slowly she turned her head and suddenly, 
as she saw the priest kneeling beside her,  

2108
03:23:32,640 --> 03:23:38,320
a look of joy came over her face. The priest 
rose from his knees to show her the cross,  

2109
03:23:38,960 --> 03:23:45,600
and she leant forward and pressed her lips to the 
body of the Man-God. It was as if she kissed the  

2110
03:23:45,600 --> 03:23:50,640
figure on the cross with more love than she 
had ever given any person during her life.

2111
03:23:52,319 --> 03:23:59,840
She then fell back on to the bed, and they 
hurried to her side. Her life had ended.
 
 
 

2112
03:24:03,760 --> 03:24:04,880
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

2113
03:24:06,160 --> 03:24:06,800
Endings

2114
03:24:09,840 --> 03:24:13,680
Death always comes as a shock, 
however much it has been expected.  

2115
03:24:14,880 --> 03:24:20,480
So when, at last, Charles saw her lying there 
so still, he threw himself on her, weeping.

2116
03:24:22,080 --> 03:24:28,160
'That's right,' said the pharmacist. 'Let 
nature have her way. You'll feel much better!'

2117
03:24:30,239 --> 03:24:36,160
Later, funeral arrangements had to be made. 
Charles thought carefully about these and wrote:

2118
03:24:37,520 --> 03:24:43,041
I want her to be buried in her wedding 
dress, with white shoes and white flowers,  

2119
03:24:43,040 --> 03:24:48,720
and her hair loose over her shoulders. She should 
be covered with a large piece of green silk.  

2120
03:24:49,520 --> 03:24:53,840
These are my wishes. Make sure 
that they are carried out.

2121
03:24:56,399 --> 03:25:01,200
The gentlemen were surprised at Charles's 
ideas, and Monsieur Homais spoke to him.

2122
03:25:02,479 --> 03:25:06,879
'It seems to us,' he said, 'that 
silk is a little expensive...'

2123
03:25:07,760 --> 03:25:10,560
'That's none of your business!' shouted Charles.  

2124
03:25:11,359 --> 03:25:15,439
'Leave me alone! You didn't love 
her, so just get out of my sight!'

2125
03:25:17,840 --> 03:25:24,000
That night, Charles, Homais and the priest sat 
beside Emma's body. She was lying with her head  

2126
03:25:24,000 --> 03:25:29,680
leaning over her right shoulder. The corner 
of her mouth, which was open, looked like a  

2127
03:25:29,680 --> 03:25:34,720
black hole at the bottom of her face; her 
two thumbs were held tightly in her hands.  

2128
03:25:35,760 --> 03:25:40,960
The sheet that covered her lay quite flat from 
her breasts down to her knees, rising up again  

2129
03:25:40,960 --> 03:25:46,640
at the tips of her toes, and it seemed to Charles 
as if an enormous weight was pressing down on her.

2130
03:25:48,880 --> 03:25:52,080
Early in the morning, Madame 
Bovary senior arrived.  

2131
03:25:53,040 --> 03:25:58,319
Charles, as he kissed her, again broke 
down and cried. Like the pharmacist,  

2132
03:25:58,319 --> 03:26:03,840
she criticized him about the funeral expenses, 
but he became so angry that she grew quiet.

2133
03:26:05,200 --> 03:26:10,399
Charles stayed by himself all afternoon. 
Berthe had been taken over to Madame Homais.  

2134
03:26:11,520 --> 03:26:15,680
In the evening, various people came in 
to see him and to express their regrets.  

2135
03:26:16,800 --> 03:26:20,320
He stood up and shook hands, 
but he could not say anything,  

2136
03:26:20,960 --> 03:26:25,680
and each newcomer sat down with the rest of 
the group, in a big circle round the fireplace.  

2137
03:26:27,439 --> 03:26:30,639
They all looked at the floor with 
serious expressions on their faces,  

2138
03:26:31,439 --> 03:26:34,719
and although everyone was 
bored, no one got up to go.

2139
03:26:36,640 --> 03:26:40,880
Upstairs Felicite, Madame 
Lefrancois and Madame Bovary senior  

2140
03:26:40,880 --> 03:26:45,840
were standing around Emma, busily 
finishing their task of dressing her.

2141
03:26:46,720 --> 03:26:52,720
'Oh, my poor mistress!' wept 
Felicite. 'My poor, poor mistress!'

2142
03:26:54,560 --> 03:27:01,360
'Just look at her!' said the landlady of the 
Lion d'Or. 'How pretty she looks even now!'

2143
03:27:03,520 --> 03:27:08,800
Then they all bent over to put the flowers on 
her hair. They had to lift her head a little,  

2144
03:27:09,359 --> 03:27:14,319
and as they did so, a stream of 
black liquid poured from her mouth.

2145
03:27:14,319 --> 03:27:18,799
'Oh, my God! The dress! Take 
care!' cried Madame Lefrancois.

2146
03:27:20,720 --> 03:27:25,360
Charles had to listen to the sound of hammers on 
wood as she was put into her last little home.  

2147
03:27:26,560 --> 03:27:30,081
Four men carried her to the 
door, the house was thrown open,  

2148
03:27:30,640 --> 03:27:37,600
and all the people of Yonville crowded near. 
Emma's father, Farmer Rouault, arrived as they  

2149
03:27:37,600 --> 03:27:42,800
were bringing her out, and fell unconscious in 
the market place when he saw the funeral carriage.

2150
03:27:44,960 --> 03:27:51,040
At the church Charles tried to think about the few 
times when they had been happy together - or when,  

2151
03:27:51,040 --> 03:27:56,640
at least, he had been happy with her. But 
remembering that she was there, underneath  

2152
03:27:56,640 --> 03:28:02,560
that green cloth, his heart was filled with 
black anger against God and against the world.

2153
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:07,600
They sang, they went down on 
their knees, they got up again;  

2154
03:28:07,600 --> 03:28:12,880
there seemed to be no end to it all. He 
remembered how once, in the early days,  

2155
03:28:12,880 --> 03:28:18,640
they had gone to church together. They had sat on 
the other side, on the right, against the wall.

2156
03:28:20,720 --> 03:28:25,280
Outside the church Charles walked in 
front, holding himself very upright.  

2157
03:28:26,640 --> 03:28:31,440
Six men carried Emma's body, and the priest 
followed saying the prayers for the dead.  

2158
03:28:32,640 --> 03:28:40,000
His voice was carried over the fields, rising and 
falling on the wind. Sometimes a sudden turn in  

2159
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:46,080
the path hid them from sight, but always the 
great silver cross rose high among the trees.  

2160
03:28:47,520 --> 03:28:53,201
The women followed, dressed in black, and each 
in her hand carried a tall lighted candle.  

2161
03:28:54,560 --> 03:29:00,880
Charles recognized every garden as he passed, and 
remembered how often, on mornings like this one,  

2162
03:29:00,880 --> 03:29:04,640
he had come away from one of them 
and set out for home and Emma.

2163
03:29:05,760 --> 03:29:08,560
Now they had arrived at the place 
where her grave had been dug.  

2164
03:29:10,080 --> 03:29:15,200
The people stood around, and all the time the 
priest was speaking, the red earth that had  

2165
03:29:15,200 --> 03:29:22,399
been piled beside the grave ran noiselessly 
down the slope into the dark hole. Then,  

2166
03:29:22,399 --> 03:29:27,599
when the four ropes were in position, they 
lowered her into the grave. Charles watched  

2167
03:29:27,600 --> 03:29:33,840
the wooden box go down until, at last, it arrived 
at the bottom and the ropes were pulled up again.  

2168
03:29:35,439 --> 03:29:40,799
The priest took the spade held out to him by his 
assistant and pushed the earth into the grave,  

2169
03:29:41,439 --> 03:29:46,319
then Charles sank down on his knees, 
throwing in handfuls of earth as he cried,  

2170
03:29:47,120 --> 03:29:55,200
'Goodbye!' He sent her kisses, and dragged himself 
to the edge of the grave, wanting to lie with her.

2171
03:29:58,160 --> 03:30:04,080
They led him away, and he soon grew calm 
again, perhaps feeling, like all the others,  

2172
03:30:04,080 --> 03:30:10,399
a sense of relief that it was now all over. 
As the crowd walked back to the village,  

2173
03:30:10,399 --> 03:30:14,879
they talked about her death and 
what a terrible thing it was -  

2174
03:30:14,880 --> 03:30:18,239
especially Lheureux, who had 
made an effort to be there.

2175
03:30:20,239 --> 03:30:24,000
'Poor little lady! What a 
terrible thing for her husband!'

2176
03:30:25,840 --> 03:30:29,520
Emma's father insisted on going 
straight back to Les Bertaux,  

2177
03:30:29,520 --> 03:30:33,920
saying that he could not sleep in that house. 
He would not even see his little grandchild.

2178
03:30:35,439 --> 03:30:38,160
'No, no! I couldn't bear the pain of it.  

2179
03:30:39,600 --> 03:30:47,201
Goodbye, then. You're a good man,' and, pointing 
at his thigh, 'I shan't forget that leg,  

2180
03:30:47,200 --> 03:30:53,599
not as long as I live. You'll always get a 
bird from me at Christmas, don't you worry.'

2181
03:30:55,680 --> 03:31:01,440
When he reached the top of the hill he turned 
again, just as, years ago, he had turned and  

2182
03:31:01,439 --> 03:31:05,839
looked back along the Saint-Victor road when 
she had left him to go with her husband.  

2183
03:31:07,439 --> 03:31:12,399
The windows in the village were all on fire 
in the light of the evening sun. He put up  

2184
03:31:12,399 --> 03:31:18,639
his hand to shade his eyes and far away, on 
the horizon, he saw the place where she lay,  

2185
03:31:19,200 --> 03:31:26,239
with the trees, here and there, dark among 
the white stones. Then he went on his way.

2186
03:31:30,479 --> 03:31:36,160
Next day, Charles had Berthe brought home 
from the nurse. She asked for her mummy  

2187
03:31:36,160 --> 03:31:40,160
and they told her that she had gone away, 
that she would bring her back some toys.  

2188
03:31:41,279 --> 03:31:45,679
Berthe spoke of her again many 
times, but as the days went by  

2189
03:31:45,680 --> 03:31:50,240
she stopped thinking about her and Charles 
could not bear the child's happy laugh.

2190
03:31:52,399 --> 03:31:55,839
Life continued around Charles, 
but it had lost its meaning.  

2191
03:31:56,960 --> 03:32:01,040
When Madame Dupuis wrote to him to 
tell him of the 'marriage of her son,  

2192
03:32:01,040 --> 03:32:07,200
Monsieur Leon Dupuis, a lawyer in Yvetot, to 
Mademoiselle Leocadie Leboeuf, of Bondeville',  

2193
03:32:07,920 --> 03:32:14,080
Charles wrote: 'How delighted my poor wife 
would have been!', but he did not really care.

2194
03:32:15,760 --> 03:32:22,800
Besides, before long, his money troubles began 
again. Monsieur Lheureux's Vincart returned once  

2195
03:32:22,800 --> 03:32:27,600
again with his demands. Now everyone 
tried to profit from Charles's loss.  

2196
03:32:28,640 --> 03:32:33,840
A music teacher in Rouen sent in a bill for six 
lessons, although Emma had never been to her once;  

2197
03:32:34,640 --> 03:32:38,161
a Madame Rollet demanded payment 
for delivering letters to Rouen.  

2198
03:32:39,600 --> 03:32:45,040
And day by day Charles had to sell the silver, 
piece by piece; then he got rid of the best  

2199
03:32:45,040 --> 03:32:52,479
furniture. All the rooms were robbed of their 
contents - except for one. Her room, her bedroom,  

2200
03:32:52,479 --> 03:32:59,120
was left as it had always been. When he had had 
his dinner, Charles went up there. He pulled the  

2201
03:32:59,120 --> 03:33:04,479
round table in front of the fire, moved her 
chair nearer, and then sat down facing it.  

2202
03:33:05,279 --> 03:33:10,080
A candle would be burning, and Berthe would be 
sitting near him, busy with her painting book.

2203
03:33:11,920 --> 03:33:17,760
Despite these efforts to keep Emma's memory 
alive, Bovary realized with sorrow that her face  

2204
03:33:17,760 --> 03:33:23,920
was fading from his memory. But every night he 
dreamed of her and it was always the same dream.  

2205
03:33:24,720 --> 03:33:31,840
He moved close to touch her, but just as he 
was taking her in his arms, she fell to dust.

2206
03:33:32,960 --> 03:33:38,720
And he was still in debt. Lheureux refused to 
wait any longer and Charles did not know what to  

2207
03:33:38,720 --> 03:33:45,840
do. At last, he decided he had to look in Emma's 
desk. There, instead of an answer to his problems,  

2208
03:33:46,560 --> 03:33:53,520
he found Leon's letters. He read them all, 
to the last line, then searched through  

2209
03:33:53,520 --> 03:33:59,680
every other piece of furniture, opening 
every drawer, emptying every box. In this  

2210
03:33:59,680 --> 03:34:05,760
way he also discovered a picture of Rodolphe - 
staring at him from a mountain of love letters.

2211
03:34:08,399 --> 03:34:11,040
Now people were shocked to see him so depressed.  

2212
03:34:12,080 --> 03:34:18,239
He never went out or had visitors; he even refused 
to go and see his patients. The only times he went  

2213
03:34:18,239 --> 03:34:23,200
out now were when he took his little girl by the 
hand, and they went together to the cemetery.

2214
03:34:25,359 --> 03:34:29,839
One day, when he had gone to the market 
at Argueil to sell his horse - his last  

2215
03:34:29,840 --> 03:34:38,239
possession - he met Rodolphe. They both 
turned pale. Rodolphe, who, when Emma died,  

2216
03:34:38,239 --> 03:34:42,239
had only sent his card, tried 
to give a few apologies.  

2217
03:34:43,680 --> 03:34:49,280
Then he grew braver, and invited Charles to have 
a bottle of beer with him at the inn. As they  

2218
03:34:49,279 --> 03:34:55,840
walked on, he talked about farming, the price of 
land, trying to avoid any uncomfortable subjects.  

2219
03:34:56,960 --> 03:35:02,239
Charles was not listening, Rodolphe noticed, 
and he anxiously watched his companion's face.

2220
03:35:03,920 --> 03:35:09,840
At last Charles said, 'I'm not angry with you.'

2221
03:35:10,479 --> 03:35:14,319
Rodolphe remained silent and 
Charles, with his head in his hands,  

2222
03:35:14,319 --> 03:35:24,239
repeated in a flat voice, a voice full of 
endless sorrow, 'No, I'm not angry with you now.'  

2223
03:35:24,239 --> 03:35:30,319
Then he said a great thing, the only great 
thing he had ever said: 'Fate is to blame!'

2224
03:35:32,319 --> 03:35:36,239
Rodolphe, who had controlled the direction 
of this particular fate for some time,  

2225
03:35:36,880 --> 03:35:41,840
thought this was rather a weak, even ridiculous 
response from a man in Bovary's position.

2226
03:35:44,160 --> 03:35:47,840
Next day, Charles went out and sat 
down on the seat in the garden.  

2227
03:35:48,880 --> 03:35:53,600
The sunlight came through the leaves, 
making shadows on the path, the perfume  

2228
03:35:53,600 --> 03:36:00,240
of the roses filled the air, the sky was blue, 
and bees flew from one open flower to the next.  

2229
03:36:01,520 --> 03:36:05,840
Charles felt disturbed, like a 
young man with an aching heart.

2230
03:36:08,000 --> 03:36:12,000
At seven o'clock little Berthe, who 
had not seen him that afternoon,  

2231
03:36:12,560 --> 03:36:17,280
came to fetch him in to dinner. His 
head was leaning back against the wall,  

2232
03:36:18,000 --> 03:36:25,200
his eyes were shut, his mouth was open, and 
his right hand was holding some long dark hair.

2233
03:36:27,359 --> 03:36:29,279
'Come on, daddy!' she said.

2234
03:36:30,640 --> 03:36:39,840
And, thinking he was only playing, she gave him a 
little push. He fell to the ground. He was dead.

2235
03:36:42,479 --> 03:36:49,279
When everything had been sold, just twelve francs 
remained, enough to pay for Mademoiselle Bovary's  

2236
03:36:49,279 --> 03:36:56,719
journey to her grandmother's house. That lady 
died the same year. As Farmer Rouault was by  

2237
