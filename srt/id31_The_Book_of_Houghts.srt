1
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:15,270
Chester was feeling more tired than usual
after a hard day at the office.

2
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,150
He had joined the company only two years before.

3
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:25,480
He had come straight from university then,
but now he was a junior manager in one of

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,480
the biggest companies in Singapore.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,300
It was an important position to have and meant
lots of extra work.

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,080
He could understand the jealousy that some
of the other workers might feel against the

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,620
'new boy', as they still called him.

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,570
He had risen quickly in the company.

9
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:51,400
Many of them, however, had been there for
years doing the same jobs.

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,430
He could understand how bad feeling towards
him might lie hidden behind their smiles.

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,850
But it didn't make life any easier.

12
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,720
He needed people whose advice he could trust
when he had to make difficult decisions.

13
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,790
He had to be sure that the bad feelings of
the other workers didn't get in the way of

14
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,750
the important business decisions he had to
make.

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:23,729
He knew he would never become a manager unless
he could be sure of people.

16
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,180
Then there was Dorothy.

17
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,940
Chester was fairly sure of his own good looks.

18
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,100
He was dark and slim and dressed smartly,
but with an eye to fashion.

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:45,659
He was a confident speaker and believed himself
to be a sociable and effective junior manager.

20
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,460
But when it came to Dorothy his judgement
disappeared.

21
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:57,170
Dorothy was a bright girl who had just joined
the company, straight from university.

22
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:05,960
He was attracted at once by her intelligent
eyes, her shy, pretty face and her soft, round

23
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
figure.

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,289
Ah, Dorothy!

25
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,230
Take today, for example.

26
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,820
He had been given some new figures to check
and he had asked Dorothy to read some of the

27
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,880
details to him while he took notes.

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,169
It was not until she had left that he realised
that he had not written notes at all.

29
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:31,680
Instead he had written Dorothy's name several
times.

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,480
He was too embarrassed to ask Dorothy for
the details again, so he had to look them

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,480
up in the office of old Mr Shaw.

32
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:47,420
Mr Shaw was known for always being in a bad
mood and he was no different this time.

33
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,650
He didn't like having to stay late to check
figures for some junior manager.

34
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,420
He didn't like it at all.

35
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,950
Chester hated it when he made mistakes.

36
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,850
It didn't look good.

37
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,250
But it didn't happen often.

38
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,470
He decided he would walk home instead of taking
the train.

39
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:12,489
It was late in the evening but he felt he
needed the walk to clear his thoughts after

40
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,040
a busy day.

41
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,520
Anyway, it would be a little punishment for
being so stupid earlier on.

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,700
He decided that he would eat at the shopping
centre near his home.

43
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,150
He liked the Chinese food there.

44
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:32,390
As he walked towards his favourite Chinese
restaurant, he saw that the lights were still

45
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,450
on in an old antique shop.

46
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,940
He had often thought of looking into this
shop because he liked shops that sold old

47
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,540
things.

48
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,139
He stopped and looked.

49
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,431
There were boxes full of old books piled outside
the shop.

50
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:51,500
On the shop window was a notice.

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,000
It read: Sorry, shop closed today.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,690
Open again tomorrow.

53
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,120
He bent down to look at the books.

54
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,579
He saw all the usual old books: school books,
cookery books and other books with dirty,

55
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:11,350
yellowing pages that were of no value to him.

56
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:17,780
There was one small, old book, however, that
he noticed at once.

57
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,509
It looked much older than the rest of the
books.

58
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,370
He picked it up.

59
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,590
'Take it!' said a voice behind him.

60
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,620
Chester turned to see a man of about eighty
years old.

61
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:38,150
The man had opened the shop door anekwas carrying
another box full of old books.

62
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,160
'These have all been around for years.

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:49,000
My nephew is taking over the business and
I don't want to leave him with all this rubbish.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,530
Nobody wants to buy any of it, so take what
you want - go on, help yourself!'

65
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:01,730
'Thanks,' said Chester as he put the old book
into his jacket pocket and went on to the

66
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:06,460
Chinese restaurant.

67
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,370
Chester sat at his table drinking a beer.

68
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,050
He had been looking forward to his chicken
and rice.

69
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,420
When it arrived, he found that the chicken
had not been cooked properly.

70
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,440
It was pink inside.

71
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,070
He decided to complain and called the waiter.

72
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,350
'Sir?' asked the waiter.

73
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,030
Chester noticed that the waiter was new to
the place.

74
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,100
'I'm not eating this,' Chester told him.

75
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,340
'The chicken is pink inside - it hasn't been
cooked properly.'

76
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,370
'It's rare chicken, sir,' the waiter said.

77
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,400
'Many of our customers prefer its finer taste.'

78
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Chester looked straight at the waiter.

79
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,170
He thought the waiter was not showing him
enough respect.

80
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,170
'Really?'

81
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,170
answered Chester.

82
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,720
'It's very popular, sir,' said the waiter.

83
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,590
'And I suppose the illness they caught from
eating undercooked chicken was popular with

84
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,180
them too, eh?' said Chester.

85
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,591
Other people in the restaurant could hear.

86
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:15,930
He was annoyed.

87
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,640
The waiter said nothing but his face turned
red.

88
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:28,440
'Please take this chicken back,' Chester told
the waiter, 'and give me a piece that has

89
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,870
been cooked all the way through.'

90
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:38,350
'Certainly, sir,' said the waiter as he took
the food and went back to the kitchen.

91
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:44,630
While Chester was waiting for his meal to
return he remembered the little book in his

92
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,540
pocket.

93
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,700
He thought he would have a look at it while
he was waiting.

94
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,900
He took it out of his pocket and examined
it.

95
00:06:52,900 --> 00:07:01,419
It was small enough to fit easily into his
pocket and was covered with old, fine leather.

96
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:06,470
He had to clean off some of the dirt in order
to read the title on the cover.

97
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:13,930
At first the title seemed to be in another
language with strange letters and shapes,

98
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,750
but as he looked they seemed to change into
English.

99
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:22,590
He closed his eyes tightly and opened them
again.

100
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,030
He was mistaken, of course.

101
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,650
He must have been.

102
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,190
When he looked again the title of the book
was there.

103
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,860
It was still dirty but it was clearly written
in English.

104
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,030
It read: The Book of Thoughts.

105
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,910
It didn't say who wrote the book.

106
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:49,520
Chester thought it must be one of those old
books which offered advice about life.

107
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,960
He felt disappointed.

108
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,030
He tried to open the book but it had an old
metal lock which stopped him.

109
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,820
Then suddenly the book seemed to open quite
naturally at the middle pages.

110
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,699
It was almost as if it wanted him to read
it.

111
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:12,139
What he saw when he looked surprised him.

112
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:18,240
The pages had nothing written on them and
they were clean and white, not at all like

113
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,330
the yellowed pages one would expect to find
in a book this old.

114
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,480
Did all the pages have no writing on them?

115
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,190
Just then the waiter returned with Chester's
chicken and rice and placed it before him.

116
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,419
'Thank you,' said^lhester.

117
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,260
'My pleasure, sir,' answered the waiter with
a smile.

118
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,960
Chester happened to look at the opened book.

119
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,770
It now had writing on the pages which only
a moment before had been clean and white.

120
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,110
The writing said:

121
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,150
He wouldn 't look so pleased with himself
if he knew what I had put on to his chicken

122
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,880
while I was in the kitchen.

123
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,260
That will teach him to make me look silly.

124
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,830
'Chester couldn't believe what he saw.

125
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,910
Was this what the waiter was thinking?

126
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,530
'Anything else, sir?' asked the waiter politely.

127
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,530
'Er...

128
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,830
no, thank you,' said Chester.

129
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,700
As the waiter walked off the writing disappeared.

130
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,440
Chester looked at his meal.

131
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,839
He didn't feel hungry anymore.

132
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,590
And he could hardly complain to the manager
about the waiter.

133
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,240
Not without telling them about the book.

134
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
Who would believe him?

135
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,410
Chester left the chicken and rice alone, paid
his bill and went.

136
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,220
He did not leave the waiter a tip.

137
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,220
***

138
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,080
When Chester got home he felt exhausted.

139
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,380
He took out the book and looked inside it
once more.

140
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,640
The pages were now all white and clear again.

141
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,760
Perhaps it had all been a result of his tiredness.

142
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,850
He had been thinking too much about work - and
about Dorothy.

143
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,779
That must be it.

144
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:21,360
There was no other possible explanation: he
was simply too tired to think straight.

145
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,050
He went to bed and slept almost at once.

146
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,050
***

147
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,010
The train was less crowded than usual the
following morning.

148
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,580
He was lucky enough to find a seat for his
short journey.

149
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:43,240
He liked to watch people as they all sat or
stood with faces that gave no sign of what

150
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,720
they were thinking.

151
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,790
Everybody avoided looking at another person
in the eye -that might cause trouble.

152
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,110
Chester relaxed in his seat.

153
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,450
He had decided that the experience of the
night before was best forgotten.

154
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,080
Who ever heard of a book that read thoughts?

155
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,870
The whole idea was crazy!

156
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,400
Then he remembered that he still had the book
in his pocket.

157
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,060
He ought to throw it away in the next rubbish
bin.

158
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,420
Yes, that's what he would do.

159
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,790
Get rid of the stupid thing.

160
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:26,180
He noticed that the woman who sat opposite
was an attractive, smartly dressed middle-aged

161
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,180
lady.

162
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,780
Her eyes looked down and her face showed nothing
of her thoughts.

163
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,740
Chester wondered what she was thinking.

164
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,899
Should he look at the book?

165
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:40,040
Perhaps just a little look would be fun.

166
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,089
Where was the harm in it?

167
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:45,330
He reached for the book in his pocket.

168
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,089
He took it out.

169
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:51,970
'Go on,' he said to himself, 'you might as
well try out the book.

170
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,430
Just for a laugh.

171
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,100
Do it!'

172
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:04,360
He opened the book and almost at once words
in clear black letters appeared on the white

173
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
pages.

174
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
The words read:

175
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,070
I've given the best years of my life to him.

176
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,290
Bank managers have married their secretaries
before now.

177
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:25,490
He must decide today - leave that awful wife
and marry me or I'll shoot him and myself

178
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,730
dead.

179
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:33,290
Chester saw that the woman's soft handbag
had something in it that looked hard.

180
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,290
Could it be a gun?

181
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,880
He quickly shut the book and looked away.

182
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:46,760
Next he saw a tough-looking man wearing a
T-shirt, showing his powerful arms, what was

183
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,690
he thinking?

184
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,870
Chester opened the book.

185
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,330
It read:

186
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,460
I like chicken better than pork.

187
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,320
Fried chicken is the best.

188
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,220
Followed by chocolate ice cream - my favourite.

189
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,050
Mum's a great cook - I love you, Mum.

190
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,640
Chester couldn't help smiling at the man.

191
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,899
The man saw him and gave him a dangerous look.

192
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:21,810
Just then the train reached Chester's station.

193
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,110
Time to get off the train.

194
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,120
He closed die book and put it back into his
pocket.

195
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:35,459
As he walked the short distance to his office
his mind turned from the book to Dorothy.

196
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,730
He had been thinking of asking her out to
dinner.

197
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,480
'I'll do it today,' he thought.

198
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,290
'But what if she hasn't thought about me in
that way?

199
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,690
Maybe she isn't as attracted to me as I am
to her?'

200
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,970
For a moment his heart felt heavy.

201
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:59,170
'Hey, come on, Chester - she's not blind.

202
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:09,780
She's sure to be interested - after all, you're
a good-looking guy and you are a junior manager.'

203
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,680
Chester walked into his office.

204
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,350
His secretary was already busy typing.

205
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,230
'Any messages, Miss Han?' he asked her.

206
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,709
'Yes, sir,' said Miss Han, 'from the Manager.

207
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,839
He says he can't go to the meeting today about
the Eastern business.

208
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,850
He wants you to take over right away.'

209
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,019
Yes!

210
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,190
This was the kind of opportunity he'd been
waiting for.

211
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,990
yHe would show them all just how good he was.

212
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,940
This was an important piece of business.

213
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,500
If he could make sure that everything went
well he would get noticed.

214
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,970
He would be an obvious choice for the next
manager's job.

215
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:03,310
If he became a manager he would be the youngest
manager in the business!

216
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,040
And Dorothy would like that, wouldn't she?

217
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,250
What woman wouldn't?

218
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,400
He thought of her soft figure in his arms.

219
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,440
Her voice was whispering his name softly,
Oh, Chester...

220
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,770
Chester...

221
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,410
Ah, Dorothy!

222
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,360
'No problem,' he told Miss Han.

223
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:34,160
'Tell the others I'll be there to prepare
for the meeting in half an hour.'

224
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,380
When he met the others Chester was confident
and did his job well.

225
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,500
He made sure that everybody knew what to do.

226
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,329
The meeting that afternoon was sure to be
a success.

227
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,470
If, of course, the figures he had were all
correct.

228
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:57,120
Just then he noticed a little smile on the
face of Mr Shaw.

229
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,190
'What's the old man got to smile about?'

230
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,190
thought Chester.

231
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:07,250
'He never smiles - why is he smiling now?'

232
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,980
Then he remembered his little book.

233
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,620
He took it out of his pocket and hid it behind
some papers.

234
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,810
He pretended to be looking at his notes and
thought of Mr Shaw.

235
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,580
The words appeared immediately:

236
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,280
I'll teach that young fool a lesson.

237
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,579
I've got some figures he doesn't know about
hidden in my office.

238
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,950
I've been working on this longer than he has.

239
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:41,610
When he can't come up with the right figures
he'll look stupid.

240
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,070
Then I'll produce them and save the day.

241
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,540
He'll look like a boy trying to do a man's
job.

242
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,850
He needs to learn some respect for experienced
professionals tike me.

243
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,980
Chester felt a cold sweat on the back of his
neck.

244
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,919
'So the old man really does dislike me, after
all!'

245
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,100
Chester wondered what all the others thought
about him but had no time to consult his book.

246
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,739
'Thanks everybody - see you all this afternoon,'
Chester told them all.

247
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:20,839
'Enjoy your lunch.'

248
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,279
While Mr Shaw was eating his sandwiches in
the park, as he always did, Chester spent

249
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:32,119
his lunch hour looking for the missing figures
in Mr Shaw's office.

250
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:39,730
Shaw was old-fashioned and preferred to use
paper rather than recording things on a computer.

251
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:45,600
It was a simple matter to copy the figures
then leave Shaw's copies where he had found

252
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,320
them -in a box in a cupboard.

253
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,820
Chester felt almost disappointed.

254
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,409
This was too easy!

255
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:57,350
Chester had missed his lunch but it had been
worth it.

256
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:03,769
His little book was turning out to be most
useful.

257
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:06,990
The meeting that afternoon was a great success.

258
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,590
He had all the figures he needed.

259
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,779
The Eastern company people were happy and
the papers were signed.

260
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:17,549
Chester's future looked good.

261
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:20,100
And as for Shaw...

262
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,809
well, Chester could tell from his red face
that he was angry because his little plan

263
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:27,789
had gone wrong.

264
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:34,759
Chester made himself a promise: he would make
sure that Shaw's future would not be good.

265
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,409
Not if he could help it.

266
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,129
Chester did not like to lose.

267
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:46,090
After the meeting there would be just enough
time to call in on Dorothy.

268
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,370
Perhaps she would like to congratulate him
over a drink.

269
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,899
When he got to her desk he found that she
was away on a training course.

270
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:56,840
She would be back the next day.

271
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,549
Just my bad luck, thought Chester.

272
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:09,679
Ah, well; for the time being he could find
somebody else to share this happy time with.

273
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,789
But how and who with?

274
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:12,789
Squash!

275
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:16,399
It was his favourite game.

276
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:20,210
Why not arrange agame with Kim, his younger
brother?

277
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,009
Kim was a salesman.

278
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:28,780
He had not gone to college but he had, like
Chester, moved to the city.

279
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,690
Chester always beat Kim at squash.

280
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,940
He liked playing with Kim.

281
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,740
He would telephone him as soon as he got home
and see if a game could be arranged for that

282
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,769
very night.

283
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:43,789
'Yeah... mmm...

284
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:46,809
I see.'

285
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:51,879
Chester was in his apartment speaking on his
mobile telephone.

286
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:56,259
As he spoke he held the telephone more tightly
than usual.

287
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:58,340
He was listening to Kim.

288
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,080
Kim was telling him that he had already promised
to take his girlfriend to the cinema.

289
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,799
As he spoke, Chester tried out the book to
see if it would work over the telephone.

290
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,539
It did.

291
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:13,269
It read:

292
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:20,090
I hate it when Chester and I play squash - he
always wants to beat me.

293
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:27,779
But he's always wanted to be a winner, at
home, at school - it never stops, even when

294
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:30,559
he has a career of his own.

295
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,470
He never thinks of me, but then he never was
much of a brother.

296
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,330
He can do without his game this time.

297
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,679
I'm staying home to watch television.

298
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,159
'OK, Kim,' said Chester.

299
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:47,840
'Enjoy the film.

300
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,840
Yes... goodbye.'

301
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,090
Chester had never realised that his brother
felt like that towards him.

302
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,499
It came as a shock.

303
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:03,250
He spent the evening watching television and
drieking wine with a takeaway meal.

304
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:10,479
At least, he thought, he would see Dorothy
tomorrow.

305
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:15,110
The next morning Chester was sitting on his
train to work.

306
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,710
He was wondering whether he should look at
The Book of Thoughts again when he noticed

307
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:25,700
a photograph of the attractive middle-aged
woman he had seen the day before.

308
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:32,369
It appeared on the front page of a newspaper
held open by the person sitting opposite him.

309
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:37,279
Her picture was next to that of an older man.

310
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,039
The headline read: TWO DIE IN LOVERS' SHOOTING.

311
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:44,269
He didn't have to read anymore.

312
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:50,289
It was obvious that the book had correctly
read the woman's mind the day before and that

313
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:51,760
she had carried out her plan.

314
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,320
But it was too late to do anything now.

315
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Anyway, it was none of his business.

316
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,789
Chester didn't feel like looking at the book
for the rest of the journey.

317
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:09,419
However, he did start to think more about
the book.

318
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:16,309
Why, he wondered, had he not told anyone else
about it?

319
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:20,490
The truth was that he could hardly believe
in it himself.

320
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:29,080
If he started telling others about an amazing
book that could read thoughts they would think

321
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,539
he was crazy.

322
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,850
And what harm might it do to his career?

323
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,320
In any case, he did not know whether it would
work for other people.

324
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,279
Perhaps the book only worked for him.

325
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:47,499
'Best leave the book alone for now,' thought
Chester.

326
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,309
'Yes, that would be best.'

327
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:58,529
But the book still sat in his pocket as he
walked off the train.

328
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:01,559
The first part of the morning was brilliant.

329
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:07,289
The Manager was very happy indeed with the
way Chester had arranged the meeting with

330
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:08,389
the Eastern company.

331
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:12,659
It had been a great success.

332
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,409
He received congratulations from all the people
at the office.

333
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:23,109
Many fine words were said to him about his
bright future.

334
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:26,429
Chester felt very pleased with himself.

335
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:30,190
Then he thought of his book.

336
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,419
"What were they all really thinking about
him?

337
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:38,960
He wanted to know who he could trust and who
he couldn't.

338
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,239
He couldn't trust Shaw, he knew that.

339
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:45,679
But, surely, there were not many like him.

340
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:54,769
'After all,' thought Chester, 'I am young,
good-looking, cheerful, successful - and I'm

341
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:57,799
one of the rising stars of the company.

342
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,120
I must be one of the most popular guys here!'

343
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,940
But he wasn't.

344
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:10,809
In fact, the book told him so every time he
looked at it.

345
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:16,989
At first he thought it was only the older
people who were jealous of his success.

346
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,519
But it was the young ones, too.

347
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,989
All of them.

348
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:29,080
They thought he was clever but believed himself
better than they were: good-looking but without

349
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,139
any feelings.

350
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:34,950
Some even thought he might be dishonest.

351
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,379
Y They hated him.

352
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:43,119
Chester had a lonely lunch at a cafe near
the park.

353
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:50,470
As he sat at his table, drinking strong coffee,
he took out the book and looked at its cover.

354
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:54,980
He read it: The Book of Thoughts.

355
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,049
He opened it.

356
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:58,730
There was nothing there.

357
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,750
Not a word.

358
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,849
He wondered why it didn't show his own thoughts.

359
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:08,679
Maybe it was because he already knew them.

360
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:10,480
Maybe.

361
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,200
But what if he asked it to show him his deepest
thoughts, the ones he didn't realise he was

362
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
thinking?

363
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,450
Would it do that?

364
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,450
Should he ask it?

365
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,429
The idea frightened him.

366
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:29,200
If thoughts were hidden, perhaps there was
a good reason for it.

367
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,109
Yet he still wanted to look.

368
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:35,440
It was almost too much for him.

369
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,710
'I won't do it!' he told himself.

370
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:45,619
'The last time I looked in the book it told
me things I wish I hadn't found out.

371
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:49,460
No, I won't do it!...

372
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,989
Not yet.'

373
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:57,700
The cafe was becoming crowded so Chester walked
back to the office.

374
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,090
Back to Dorothy.

375
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:03,119
She would be back from her training course
by now.

376
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,640
He would see her and ask her to dinner.

377
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,239
He was certain that she would not be like
the other people in the office.

378
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:16,139
His darling Dorothy.

379
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:20,429
When Chester got back to the office he saw
Dorothy.

380
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:23,499
She was talking to old Shaw.

381
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,220
But Dorothy was nice to everybody.

382
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,529
She was that kind of person.

383
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:32,200
He called her over and she smiled to him.

384
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,929
Even Shaw smiled.

385
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:40,760
Chester took her to a quieter part of the
office and asked.

386
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,700
Dorothy said yes, she would love to go to
dinner with him.

387
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,359
Her intelligent eyes were shining in her lovely
face.

388
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,440
Chester watched as her soft, round figure
walked back to her desk.

389
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,519
Dorothy, at least, liked him.

390
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,279
He could be sure of her.

391
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,070
Darling Dorothy!

392
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:11,309
But he would have just one quick look in the
book to make sure.

393
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:13,779
He reached into his pocket.

394
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:16,309
The book was not there.

395
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:18,559
He felt alarmed.

396
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,190
He quickly went back to his office.

397
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:28,320
He searched all his pockets and his briefcase,
even his desk drawers, though he knew he hadn't

398
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,950
put the book in any of them.

399
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,739
It was no use.

400
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:36,179
The Book of Thoughts was gone.

401
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,440
Chester remembered the crowds as he left the
cafe.

402
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,330
Had somebody taken the book out of his pocket?

403
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:47,440
Things don't just disappear by themselves.

404
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,259
Do they?

405
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:53,289
All kinds of thoughts crowded through his
mind.

406
00:27:53,289 --> 00:28:00,019
But the least expected and perhaps the most
welcome thought was the feeling that a heavy

407
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:03,859
weight had been taken away from him.

408
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:07,820
He went back to try and see Dorothy again.

409
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,149
She was talking to old Shaw - again.

410
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,600
She saw Chester and waved to him.

411
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,919
At least, he thought, he still had Dorothy.

412
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,369
He had his career and he had Dorothy.

413
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,719
None of the other people mattered.

414
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:30,029
He could trust Dorothy.

415
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:32,609
Of course he could.

416
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:34,389
He was almost sure of it.

417
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:34,639
- THE END -
