1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:10,270
Life is not much fun if you work as a typist
in an office, and you earn so little that

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,719
you can't even buy yourself a nice pair of
shoes.

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,140
A girl needs shoes.

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:29,020
A girl needs a boyfriend with a nice fast
car, and a nice fat wallet.

5
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,899
So Mercy finds a boyfriend who suits her needs.

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:49,060
The trouble is, her big sister - sensible,
married Connie - won't like it at all...

7
00:00:49,060 --> 00:01:04,939
As Mercy puts the cover on her typewriter,
the thought of the bus ride home goes through

8
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,280
her like a pain.

9
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,420
It is her luck, she thinks.

10
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,100
Everything is just her luck.

11
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,860
If she had one of those university boys for
a boyfriend, wouldn't he come and take her

12
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,440
home every evening?

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:31,340
Certainly, Joe would love to do exactly that
- with his taxi.

14
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:38,979
And he is as handsome as anything, and a good
man, but you know...

15
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:42,380
A taxi is a taxi.

16
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:50,560
The possibility of the other man actually
coming to fetch her - oh well.

17
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,350
She knows it will take some time before she'll
be brave enough to ask for things like that

18
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,530
from him.

19
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,270
But it's hard not to think about it.

20
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,950
Would it really be so dangerous?

21
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:14,360
Doesn't one government car look like another
- the hugeness of it, the dark glass, the

22
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,719
driver in uniform?

23
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:24,419
She can already see herself stepping out of
the car to greet the other girls, who look

24
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,719
at her with eyes like knives.

25
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,310
To begin with, she will be a little more careful.

26
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,909
The driver can drop her under the neem trees
in the morning and pick her up from there

27
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:48,140
in the evening... anyway, she will have to
wait a little while for that and it is just

28
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,290
her bad luck.

29
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:58,699
So for the meantime it is going to be the
local bus with its dirty seats, unpleasant

30
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:02,680
passengers, and rude conductors...

31
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Jesus!

32
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,209
She doesn't wish herself dead or anything
as stupidly final as that.

33
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:11,779
Oh no.

34
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:20,309
She just wishes she could sleep deep and only
wake up on the day of her first car ride to

35
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:21,439
work.

36
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:28,469
The new pair of black shoes are more sensible
than their owner, though.

37
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:35,950
As she walks out of the office, they sing:
Count, count, count your blessings.

38
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:43,540
Count, Mercy, count your blessings Count,
Mercy, count your blessings Count, count,

39
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,170
count your blessings.

40
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:52,779
They sing out of the office, along the road,
and into the bus.

41
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:59,409
And they start singing again along the path
as she opens the front gate and walks to the

42
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:00,760
door.

43
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,110
'Sissie!'

44
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,810
Mercy called.

45
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,510
'Hei Mercy.'

46
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:16,500
And the door opened to show the face of Connie,
her big sister, six years older, and now heavy

47
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,980
with her second child.

48
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,180
Mercy dropped into the nearest chair.

49
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,580
'Welcome home.

50
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,670
How was the office today?'

51
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,870
'Sister, don't ask.

52
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,130
Look at my hands.

53
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,710
My fingers are dead with typing.

54
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,070
Oh God, I don't know what to do.'

55
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,530
'Why, what is wrong?' asked Connie.

56
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,400
'You tell me what is right.

57
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,020
Why should I be a typist?'

58
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,240
'What else would you be?'

59
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,760
'What a strange question.

60
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,980
Is typing the only job there is in this world?

61
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,550
You are a teacher, are you not?' said Mercy.

62
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,880
'But... but...'

63
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,210
'But what?

64
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,920
It's my fault - is that what you're saying?

65
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,660
I didn't do well enough in the exams, so I
can't be a teacher.

66
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,230
Or even a secretary.'

67
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,590
'Mercy, what is the matter?' said Connie.

68
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,750
'What have I done?

69
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,740
Why have you come home so angry?'

70
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,880
Mercy broke into tears.

71
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,900
'Oh, I'm sorry, Sissie.

72
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,740
It's just that I am sick of everything.

73
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,620
The office, living with you and your husband.

74
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,820
I want a husband of my own, children.

75
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,970
I want...

76
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,970
I want...'

77
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,740
'But you are young and beautiful.

78
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,770
And marriage - well, it's you who are delaying
it.

79
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,540
Look at all these people who are running after
you,' said Connie.

80
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,160
'Sissie, I don't like what you are doing.

81
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,170
So stop it.'

82
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,180
'Okay, okay, okay.'

83
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,720
And there was a silence.

84
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,560
'Which of them could I marry?' said Mercy.

85
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:24,930
'Joe is - mm, fine - but, but I just don't
like him.'

86
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,670
'Little sister, you and I can be truthful
with one another.

87
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:36,740
I am not that old or wise, but I can advise
you a little.

88
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,780
Joe drives someone else's car now.

89
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,370
Well, you never know.

90
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:49,190
Lots of taxi drivers own their taxis in the
end, sometimes more than one.'

91
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,110
'Of course.

92
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,790
But what a pity that you are married already.

93
00:06:53,790 --> 00:07:00,120
Or I could make a date for you - with Joe!'

94
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,030
And they both burst out laughing.

95
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:10,810
It was when Mercy got up to go to the bedroom
that Connie noticed the new shoes.

96
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,260
'Ei, those are beautiful shoes.

97
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,620
Are they new?'

98
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:25,460
From the other room, Mercy's voice came and
went as she undressed and then dressed again.

99
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,230
But that was not the reason for the uncertainty
in her voice.

100
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,700
'Oh, I forgot to tell you about them.

101
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,560
In fact, I was going to show them to you.

102
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,480
I think it was on Tuesday I bought them.

103
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,040
Or was it Wednesday?

104
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,410
When I came home from the office, you and
James had taken Akosua out.

105
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,070
And later I forgot all about them.'

106
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,070
'I see.

107
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,610
But they are very pretty.

108
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,690
Were they expensive?'

109
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,770
'No, not really.'

110
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,740
Mercy's answer came too quickly.

111
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:10,230
And she said only last week that she didn't
have a penny on her, thought Connie.

112
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:16,750
And I believed her because I know what they
pay her is just not enough to live on.

113
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,590
I've been thinking she manages very well.

114
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,940
But these shoes...

115
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,990
And she is not the type who would borrow money
just to buy a pair of shoes; she would just

116
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,260
wear her old pairs till things got better.

117
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,019
Oh, I wish I knew what to do.

118
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,200
I mean, I'm not her mother.

119
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,759
And I wonder how James will see these problems.

120
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,550
'Sissie, you look worried,' said Mercy.

121
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,430
'Hmm, when don't I?

122
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:57,029
With the baby coming in a couple of months
and the government's new controls on pay.

123
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:04,699
On top of everything, I have dependable information
that James is running after a new girl.'

124
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:06,420
Mercy laughed.

125
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,139
'Oh, Sissie.

126
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:11,870
You always get dependable information on these
things.

127
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,889
But men are like that.'

128
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,699
'They are selfish.'

129
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:23,629
'No, it's just that women allow them to behave
the way they do instead of taking some freedom

130
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,189
themselves.'

131
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:33,320
'Well, if I had the chance to behave the same
way,' said Connie, 'I wouldn't make use of

132
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
it.'

133
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,170
'But why not?'

134
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,029
'Because I love James.

135
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:45,420
I love James and I am not interested in any
other man.'

136
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,020
Her voice was full of tears.

137
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,499
But Mercy was amused.

138
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:51,999
'Oh God.

139
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:54,410
Now listen to that.

140
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,930
It's women like you who keep all of us down.'

141
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,300
'Well, I'm sorry but it's how the good God
made me.'

142
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
'Mm.

143
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,600
I'm sure I can love several men at the same
time.'

144
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,110
'Mercy!'

145
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,869
They burst out laughing again.

146
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:17,399
And yet they are sad.

147
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,230
But laughter is always best.

148
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:27,230
Mercy complained that she was hungry and so
they went to the kitchen to heat up some food

149
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,730
and eat.

150
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,730
The two sisters alone.

151
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,970
It is no use waiting for James.

152
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,119
'Sissie, I am going to see a film.'

153
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,720
This from Mercy.

154
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
'Where?'

155
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,360
'The Globe.'

156
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,370
'Are you going with Joe?'

157
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,370
'No.'

158
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,470
'Are you going alone?'

159
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,720
'No.'

160
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,220
Careful, Connie.

161
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,240
'Who are you going with?'

162
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,939
Careful, Connie, please.

163
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:03,759
Your little sister's eyes are looking angry.

164
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,850
Look at the sudden lines around her mouth.

165
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,980
Connie, a sister is a good thing.

166
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,250
Even a younger sister.

167
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,339
Particularly when you have no mother or father.

168
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:20,160
'Mercy, who are you going out with?'

169
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,201
'Well, I had food in my mouth.

170
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:28,029
And I had to finish it before I could answer
you, no?'

171
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:31,019
'I am sorry.'

172
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,430
Connie's voice is soft.

173
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,600
'And anyway, do I have to tell you everything?'

174
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,880
'Oh no.

175
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,600
It's just that I didn't think it was a question
I was not allowed to ask.'

176
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,920
There was more silence.

177
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,800
Connie cleared her throat and waited, afraid.

178
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,589
'I am going out with Mensar-Arthur,' Mercy
said.

179
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:05,690
As Connie asked the next question, she wondered
if the words were leaving her lips.

180
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,690
'Mensar-Arthur?'

181
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,690
'Yes.'

182
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,690
'Which one?'

183
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,690
'How many do you know?'

184
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,949
Something jumped in Connie's chest and she
wondered what it was.

185
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:17,800
Perhaps it was the baby.

186
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,119
'Do you mean that politician?'

187
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,519
she said.

188
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,689
'Yes.'

189
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:26,029
'But, Mercy...'

190
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:31,660
Little sister only sits and chews her food.

191
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,470
'But, Mercy...'

192
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,190
Chew, chew, chew.

193
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,009
'But, Mercy...'

194
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,730
'What?' said Mercy.

195
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,360
'He is so old.'

196
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,079
Chew, chew, chew.

197
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:52,970
'Perhaps, I mean, perhaps that really doesn't
matter, does it?

198
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,529
But they say he has so many wives and girlfriends.'

199
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,529
Please, little sister.

200
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:06,610
Your private life is not my business, but
you just said yourself that you wanted a man

201
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,100
of your own.

202
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,360
That man belongs to so many women already...

203
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,139
That silence again.

204
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:22,600
Then there was only Mercy's footsteps as she
went to wash her plate, and then left the

205
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
kitchen.

206
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,499
Tears ran down Connie's face.

207
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:33,089
She heard Mercy having a bath, then getting
ready to leave the house.

208
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:34,529
The shoes.

209
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:38,190
Then she was gone.

210
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,680
Connie hadn't meant to start an argument.

211
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,910
What use is a sister, if you can't have a
talk with her?

212
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,489
And what would their parents say if they were
alive?

213
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:52,379
They were good church-goers.

214
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,509
They feared God.

215
00:13:55,509 --> 00:14:01,189
Running around with an old and evil politician
would horrify them.

216
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:10,769
A big car arrived outside the house, a huge
machine from the white man's land.

217
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:18,179
The sound of its super-smooth engine was soft
and gentle, unlike the hard banging of the

218
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,639
girl's high-heeled shoes.

219
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:29,629
When Mensar-Arthur saw Mercy, he reached across
and opened the door to the passenger seat.

220
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:39,620
She sat down and the door closed with a smooth
little sound as the car slid away.

221
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,730
After they had gone a mile or so from the
house, the man started a conversation.

222
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,199
'And how is my darling today?'

223
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:53,369
'I am well.'

224
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:56,889
But everything about her said bad news.

225
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:01,879
'You look serious today, why?'

226
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:04,709
She remained silent and still.

227
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:09,830
'My dear, what is the matter?'

228
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,610
'Nothing.'

229
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,390
'Oh.'

230
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,130
He cleared his throat.

231
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,189
'Eh, and how were the shoes?'

232
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:20,209
'Very nice.

233
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:24,009
In fact, I am wearing them now.

234
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:29,529
They feel a little small, but then all new
shoes are like that.'

235
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,160
'And the handbag?'

236
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,360
he asked.

237
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,299
'I like it very much, too...

238
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:38,920
My sister noticed them.

239
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,549
I mean the shoes.'

240
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:44,399
Now the bad news was out.

241
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,759
'Did she ask you where you got them from?'

242
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,759
'No.'

243
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,759
He cleared his throat again.

244
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,440
'Where did we agree to go tonight?'

245
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,790
'The Globe, but I don't want to see a film.'

246
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,480
'Is that so?

247
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,179
Mm, I am glad because people always notice
things.'

248
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:10,699
'But they won't be too surprised.'

249
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:15,470
'What are you saying, my dear?'

250
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,470
'Nothing.'

251
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:21,040
'Okay, so what shall we do?

252
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,199
Shall I drive to the Seaway?'

253
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,120
'Oh yes.'

254
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:33,179
He drove to the Seaway, to a part of the beach
they knew very well.

255
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:39,680
She loves it here, with the wide sandy beach
and the old sea.

256
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,350
She has often wished to drive very near to
the end of the sands until the tyres of the

257
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,189
car touched the water.

258
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:57,269
A very foolish idea, as he said sharply to
her the first time she mentioned it.

259
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:02,070
It was in his 'I-am-old-enough-to-be-your-father'
voice.

260
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,250
There are always disadvantages.

261
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,490
Things could be different.

262
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,180
If she had a younger lover...

263
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:20,560
Handsome, maybe not rich like this man here,
but with enough money to afford a fast car.

264
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:28,230
A car like the ones she has seen in films,
with tyres that can do everything...

265
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:34,950
and they would drive to exactly where the
sea and the sand meet.

266
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,060
'We are here,' he said.

267
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,770
'Don't let's get out.

268
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,260
Let's just sit inside and talk.'

269
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,480
'Okay.

270
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,120
But what is it, my darling?'

271
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,580
'I have told my sister about you,' said Mercy.

272
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,040
'Good God.

273
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Why?'

274
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,640
'I couldn't keep it to myself any longer.'

275
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,880
'Childish.

276
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,410
It was not necessary at all.

277
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,010
She is not your mother,' he said.

278
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,010
'No.

279
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,860
But she is all I have.

280
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,340
And she has been very good to me.'

281
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,940
'Well, it's her duty.

282
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,940
A sister's duty.'

283
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,590
'Then it's my duty, a sister's duty, to tell
her about something like this.

284
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,510
I may get into trouble.'

285
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,030
'Don't be silly,' he said.

286
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,440
'I normally take good care of my girlfriends.'

287
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:44,320
'I see,' she said, and for the first time
in the one month since she agreed to be this

288
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:53,170
man's lover, the tears which suddenly rose
into her eyes came there naturally.

289
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,170
'And you promised you wouldn't tell her.'

290
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,690
It was Father's voice now.

291
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,850
'Don't be angry.

292
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,990
After all, she was sure to hear it one day.'

293
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,970
'My darling, you are too wise.

294
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,460
What did she say?'

295
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,410
'She wasn't happy.'

296
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,790
'Don't worry.

297
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:21,150
Find out something she wants very much but
cannot get in this country.'

298
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:27,900
'I know for sure she wants an electric motor
for her sewing machine.'

299
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,900
'Mm.

300
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:36,650
I am going to London next week on government
business, so if you bring me the details of

301
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,510
the machine, I shall get her the motor.'

302
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,030
'Thank you.'

303
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:48,390
'Oh, and let me know as soon as you want to
leave your sister's place.

304
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,460
I have got you one of the government houses.'

305
00:19:52,460 --> 00:20:02,330
'Oh... oh,' she said, pleased for the first
time since this awful day had begun.

306
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:08,170
Down on the beach, the old Sea slides up and
down the sands.

307
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,920
He takes no notice of humans.

308
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,860
He has seen things happen along these beaches.

309
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,180
Different things.

310
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,910
The same things.

311
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,800
He never does anything about them.

312
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,650
Why should he?

313
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,210
People are unimportant.

314
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:31,940
Here is a fifty-year-old 'big man' who thinks
he is somebody.

315
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:39,200
And a twenty-three-year-old child who chooses
a silly way to fight life's problems.

316
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,390
As they play with each other's bodies on the
back seat of the car, the old Sea shuts his

317
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,410
eyes, bored.

318
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:56,111
He moves further up the sands, but the car
is parked safely away from the sea, and the

319
00:20:56,111 --> 00:21:02,560
rising water cannot reach its tyres.

320
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,790
James has come home late.

321
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:11,000
But then he has been coming back late for
the past few weeks.

322
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,440
Connie is crying and he knows it as soon as
he enters the bedroom.

323
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:24,430
He hates tears, because, like many men, he
knows they are one of the strongest weapons

324
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,930
that women have.

325
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,310
'James.'

326
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:33,120
'Oh, are you still awake?'

327
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,760
He quickly sits beside her.

328
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,460
'Connie, what's the matter?

329
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,310
You've been crying again.'

330
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,020
'James, where were you?'

331
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,610
'Connie, I have warned you about this.

332
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:55,150
I won't let you question me like a prisoner
every time I am a little late.'

333
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,180
She sat up.

334
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,120
'A little late!

335
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,980
It is nearly two o'clock.'

336
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:06,740
'Anyway, you won't believe me if I tell you
the truth.'

337
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:14,480
She lies down again and turns her face to
the wall, and James throws himself down beside

338
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
her.

339
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,070
'James, there is something much more serious.'

340
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,540
'You have heard about my newest affair?'

341
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:29,090
'Yes, but that is not what I am talking about.'

342
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:36,370
'Jesus, is it possible that there is anything
more important than that?'

343
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:41,410
And as they laugh, they know that something
has happened.

344
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:48,860
One of those things which, with luck, will
keep them together for some time to come.

345
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,640
'But James, what shall I do?'

346
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,230
'About what?'

347
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,230
'Mercy.

348
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,830
She is having an affair with Mensar-Arthur.'

349
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,030
'Wonderful.'

350
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,540
'James, we must do something about it.

351
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,320
It's very serious.'

352
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,110
'Why shouldn't she?'

353
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,260
'But it is wrong.

354
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,210
And she is ruining herself.'

355
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:20,590
'Since every other girl she knows has ruined
herself and made money out of it, why shouldn't

356
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,590
she?

357
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:28,080
Her friends don't earn any more than she does,
but every day they wear new dresses, shoes,

358
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,270
and so on, to work.

359
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,060
What do you expect her to do?'

360
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,790
'The fact that other girls do it doesn't mean
that Mercy should do it too.'

361
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,680
'You're being very silly.

362
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,710
If I were Mercy, I am sure that's exactly
what I would do.

363
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,650
And you know I mean it, too.'

364
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,460
James is cruel.

365
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,950
Terrible.

366
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,440
Mean.

367
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,510
Connie breaks into fresh tears, and James
puts his arm around her.

368
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,560
There is one thing he must make her understand,
though.

369
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,540
'In fact, tell her to stay with him.

370
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:16,280
He may be able to speak to someone in your
government office so that after the baby is

371
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,180
born you can keep your job there.'

372
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,790
'James, you want me to use my sister!'

373
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,650
'She is using herself, remember.'

374
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,750
'James, you are terrible.'

375
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:36,020
'And maybe he would even agree to get us a
new car from abroad.

376
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:43,290
I shall pay for everything, but that would
be better than that old car I was thinking

377
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,290
about.

378
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,060
Think of that.'

379
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:51,700
'You will ride in it alone.'

380
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,490
'Well...'

381
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,920
That was a few months before the coup.

382
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:03,820
Mensar-Arthur did go to London and bought
something for all his wives and girlfriends.

383
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,170
He even remembered the motor for Connie's
machine.

384
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:12,820
When Mercy took it to her, she was quite confused.

385
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:18,460
She had wanted this thing for a long time,
and yet one side of her said that accepting

386
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,330
it was wrong.

387
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:27,730
She could not discuss the whole business with
Mercy, and James always took Mercy's side.

388
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:34,420
She took the motor with thanks; the price
she paid was her silence about Mercy.

389
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:43,690
In a short while, Mercy left the house to
go and live in the government house that Mensar-Arthur

390
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,600
had managed to get for her.

391
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,170
Then, a couple of weeks later, the coup.

392
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:56,310
Mercy left her new place before anybody could
throw her out.

393
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,100
James never got his car.

394
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,780
Connie's new baby was born.

395
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,270
Of the three, Connie was happiest with these
changes.

396
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:15,200
In her eyes, Mensar-Arthur and everything
that went with him meant trouble for her sister

397
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,980
and for her own feelings too.

398
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,340
Now things could return to normal.

399
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:29,060
Mercy would move back to the house, perhaps
find a man who was more - ordinary, let's

400
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,060
say.

401
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:36,660
Then she would get married and these terrible
times would be forgotten.

402
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:43,980
God is good, he brought the coup before her
sister's affair became widely known and ruined

403
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,840
her name...

404
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:53,980
The arrival of the new baby has ended all
the difficulties between James and Connie.

405
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:59,510
He is that kind of man, and she that kind
of woman.

406
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:03,440
Mercy has not been seen for many days.

407
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,230
Connie is beginning to get worried...

408
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:14,060
James heard the baby's loud cries the moment
he opened the front gate.

409
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,800
He ran in, holding the few things he had bought
on his way home.

410
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,240
'We are in here,' called Connie.

411
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,110
'I certainly could hear you.

412
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:31,870
If there is anything people in this country
have, it is a big mouth.'

413
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,590
'Don't I agree?

414
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,310
But we're well.

415
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,380
He's eating normally and everything.

416
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,440
You?'

417
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,540
'Nothing new.

418
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,230
More stories about the ex-politicians.'

419
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,330
'What do you mean, nothing new?' said Connie.

420
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:56,010
'Look at the excellent job the soldiers have
done, cleaning up the country of all that

421
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,010
dirt.

422
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:03,000
I feel free already and I can't wait to get
out and enjoy it.'

423
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,090
James laughed bitterly.

424
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:09,710
'All I know is that Mensar-Arthur is in prison.

425
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,230
No use.

426
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,470
And I'm not getting my car.'

427
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,610
'I never took you seriously on that car business.'

428
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:25,260
'Honestly, Connie, don't you want me, your
husband, to be successful and get rich?'

429
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,340
'Not out of my sister's ruin.'

430
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,480
'Ruin, ruin, ruin!

431
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Christ!

432
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,880
See, Connie, the funny thing is that I am
sure you are the only person who thought it

433
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:44,610
was a disaster to have a sister who was the
girlfriend of a big man.'

434
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:50,210
'Okay; now all is over, and don't let's argue
about it.'

435
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:55,240
'Was it you who arranged the coup, I wonder?

436
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,010
Just because of your sister?

437
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,020
It wouldn't surprise me.'

438
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:06,060
And Connie wondered why he said that with
so much bitterness.

439
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,540
She wondered if...

440
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,650
'Has Mercy been here?'

441
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,210
asked James.

442
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,320
'Not yet, later, maybe.

443
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Mm.

444
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,370
I had hoped she would move back here and start
all over again.'

445
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,960
'I am not surprised she hasn't.

446
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,940
In fact, if I were her, I wouldn't come back
here either.

447
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,280
Not to listen to endless good advice from
big sister, no thank you.'

448
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,090
'Mercy is my only sister.

449
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:40,750
I can't sit and see her life going wrong without
feeling it.

450
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,850
I'm grateful that something put a stop to
that.

451
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,410
What worries me now is that she won't tell
me where she's living.

452
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:54,650
She talks about a girlfriend but I'm not sure
that I know her.'

453
00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:02,470
'If I were you, I would stop worrying because
it seems Mercy can take care of herself quite

454
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,830
well,' said James.

455
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:11,260
Then there was the sound of a car stopping
outside the house.

456
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,930
Ah, but the footsteps were unmistakably Mercy's.

457
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:22,460
Are those shoes the old pair which were new
a couple of months ago?

458
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,460
Or are they the newest pair?

459
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,700
And here she is herself, the pretty one.

460
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,650
A happy, smiling Mercy.

461
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,370
'Hello, hello, my people!'

462
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,590
And she goes straight to the baby.

463
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,590
'Dow-dah-dee-day!

464
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,440
How's my dear young man today?

465
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,910
Grow up fast and come to take care of Auntie
Mercy.'

466
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:51,310
Both Connie and James cannot take their eyes
off her.

467
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:56,880
Connie says, 'He says to Auntie Mercy he is
fine.'

468
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,830
Still they watch her, horrified, and wondering
what it's all about.

469
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,890
Because they both know it is about something.

470
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:11,010
'Listen, people, I brought a friend to meet
you.

471
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,610
A man.'

472
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,630
'Where is he?' from James.

473
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,550
'Bring him in,' from Connie.

474
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,360
'You know, Sissie, you are a new mother.

475
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,720
I thought I'd come and ask you if it's all
right.'

476
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:34,720
'Of course,' say James and Connie, and for
some reason they are both afraid of what is

477
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
coming.

478
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,810
'He is Captain Ashley.'

479
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,120
'Which one?'

480
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,400
'How many do you know?'

481
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,200
James still thinks it is impossible.

482
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:53,400
'Eh... do you mean the army officer who has
just been given the job of... of...'

483
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
'Yes.'

484
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:02,100
'Wasn't there a picture in The Crystal over
the weekend of his daughter's wedding?

485
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:10,230
And another one of him with his wife and children
and grandchildren?' said James.

486
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,840
'Yes,' said Mercy.

487
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:20,320
Connie just sits there with her mouth open
that wide...

488
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,120
- THE END -
