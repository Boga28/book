CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,640
As a child I had been 
impressed by the Boerum House.  

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,320
It was fairly new then, and shiny with new 
paint - a huge Victorian building. Standing  

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,240
in front of it this early Christmas Eve, however, 
I could find no echo of that youthful impression.  

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,040
It was all a depressing gray now, and the 
curtains behind the windows were drawn completely  

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,360
so that the house seemed to present 
blindly staring eyes to the passerby.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,520
When I knocked my stick sharply on the door, 
Celia opened it. 'There is a doorbell,' she said.

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,240
She was still wearing the long unfashionable 
and badly wrinkled black dress which must have  

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:55,120
been her mother's, and she looked more than ever 
like old Katrin had in her later years: the thin  

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,480
bony body, the tight thin line of her lips,  

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,680
the colorless hair pulled back hard enough 
to remove every wrinkle from her forehead.  

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,840
She reminded me of a steel trap ready to shut 
down on anyone who touched her incautiously.

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,640
I said, 'I am aware that the 
doorbell is not connected, Celia,'  

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:26,080
and walked past her into the hall. She banged the 
door shut, and instantly we were in half-darkness.

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,760
I put out my hand for the light 
switch, but Celia said sharply,  

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,920
'This is no time for lights! There's been 
a death in this house, you know that.'

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,080
'I have good reason to know,' I said, 
'but your manner now does not impress me.'

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,920
'She was my brother's wife, and very dear to me.'

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,640
I moved towards her and rested 
my stick on her shoulder.  

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,120
'Celia,' I said, 'as your family's lawyer, let me 
give you a word of advice. The inquest is over,  

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:08,320
and you've been cleared. But nobody believed 
you then, and nobody ever will. Remember that.'

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,440
She pulled away. 'Is that 
what you came to tell me?'

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,960
'I came because I knew your 
brother would want to see me today.  

24
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
I suggest you keep away while I talk to him.'

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,600
'Keep away from him yourself!' she cried. 'He 
was at the inquest and saw them clear my name.  

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,360
In a little while he'll forget the 
terrible things he thinks about me.  

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,840
Keep away from him so that he can forget.'

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,440
I started walking cautiously up the dark 
stairs, but she followed me. 'I prayed,'  

29
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:51,440
she said, 'and was told that life is too short for 
hatred. So when he comes to me, I'll forgive him.'

30
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,280
I reached the top of the stairs 
and almost fell over something.  

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,240
I swore, then said, 'If you're not going to use 
lights, you should at least keep the way clear.  

32
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,880
Why don't you get these things out of here?'

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,440
'They are poor Jessie's things,' she said. 
'Ready for throwing out. It hurts Charlie  

34
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,360
to see anything of hers. I knew it 
would be best to throw them out.'  

35
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,320
Alarm came into her voice. 'But 
you won't tell him, will you?'

36
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,000
I went into Charlie's room 
and closed the door behind me.  

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,080
The curtains were drawn, but the ceiling light 
showed me that he was lying on his bed with an  

38
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,120
arm over his eyes. Slowly, 
he stood up and looked at me.

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,160
'Well,' he said at last, nodding towards the door,  

40
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,320
she didn't give you any light 
on the way up, did she?'

41
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,720
'No,' I said, 'but I know the way.'

42
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,640
'She gets around better in the dark than I do in 
the light. She'd rather have it that way, too.  

43
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,600
Otherwise she might look into a 
mirror and be frightened of what she  

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:15,840
saw.' He gave a short laugh. 'All you 
hear from her now is how she loved Jessie,  

45
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:23,200
and how sorry she is. Maybe she thinks if she 
says if often enough, people will believe it.'

46
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,040
I dropped my hat and stick on the 
bed and put my overcoat beside them.  

47
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,400
Then I took out a cigarette and waited 
until he found a match to light it for me.  

48
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,840
His hand shook violently. Charlie 
was five years younger than Celia,  

49
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,120
but seeing him then I thought he looked ten years 
older. His hair was so fair that it was difficult  

50
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,840
to see whether or not he was going gray. He had 
not shaved for several days, and there were huge  

51
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,200
blue-black bags under his eyes. He stared 
at me, pulling uncertainly at his mustache.

52
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,840
'You know why I wanted to see you,' he said.

53
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,840
'I can imagine,' I said, 
'but I'd rather you told me.'

54
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,840
'It's Celia,' he said. 'I want 
her to get what she deserves.  

55
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,400
Not prison. I want the law to take her and 
kill her, and I want to be there to watch it.'

56
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,760
'You were at the inquest, Charlie,' I said. 
'You saw what happened. Celia's cleared and,  

57
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,680
unless more evidence can be 
produced, she stays cleared.'

58
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,840
'What more evidence does anyone need? They were 
arguing violently at the top of the stairs.  

59
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,440
Celia threw Jessie down to the bottom 
and killed her. That's murder, isn't it?'

60
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:07,040
I was tired, and sat down in the old leather 
armchair. 'There were no witnesses,' I said.

61
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,920
'I heard Jessie scream and I heard her fall,' he 
said, 'and when I ran out and found her there,  

62
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,640
I heard Celia bang her door 
shut. She pushed Jessie!'

63
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,200
'But you didn't see anything. 
And Celia says she wasn't there.  

64
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,840
As you weren't an eyewitness, you can't make a 
murder out of what might have been an accident.'

65
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,800
He slowly shook his head. 'You 
don't really believe that,' he said.  

66
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,000
'Because if you do, you can get out 
now and never come near me again.'

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,200
'It doesn't matter what I believe. I'm telling 
you the legal position. What about motive? What  

68
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:02,240
did Celia have to gain from Jessie's death? 
There's no money or property involved.'

69
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Charlie sat down on the edge of his bed. 'No,' he 
whispered, 'there's no money or property in it.  

70
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,800
It's me. First, it was the old lady with 
her heart trouble whenever I tried to do  

71
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,880
anything for myself. Then when she died 
and I thought I was free, it was Celia.  

72
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,840
She never had a husband or 
a baby - but she had me!'

73
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,480
'She's your sister, Charlie. She loves you.'

74
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,720
He laughed unpleasantly. 'And she can't let me go.  

75
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:49,040
When I think back now, I still can't understand 
how she did it. She would look at me in a certain  

76
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,480
way and all the strength would go out of me. 
And it was like that until I met Jessie ...  

77
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:04,320
I remember the day I brought Jessie home, and 
told Celia we were married. There was a look  

78
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,840
in her eye - the same look that must have been 
there when she pushed Jessie down those stairs.'

79
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,840
I said, 'But you admitted at the inquest  

80
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,120
that you never saw her threaten 
or do anything to hurt Jessie.'

81
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,000
'Of course I never saw! But Jessie would go around 
sick to her heart every day without saying a Word,  

82
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,120
and would cry in bed every 
night and not tell me why.  

83
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:40,080
I knew what was going on. I talked to her and I 
talked to Celia, and both of them just shook their  

84
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,440
heads. But when I saw Jessie lying 
there, it didn't surprise me at all.'

85
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:54,240
'I don't think it surprised anyone who knows 
Celia,' I said, 'but that isn't evidence.'

86
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,760
He beat his hand against his knee. 'What 
can I do? That's what I need you to tell me.  

87
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,800
All my life I've never done anything because 
of her. And that's what she expects now - that  

88
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,120
I won't do anything, and that she'll get away 
with it.' He stood up and stared at the door,  

89
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,280
then at me. 'But I can do something,' 
he whispered. 'Do you know what?'

90
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,720
I stood up facing him and shook my head. 'Whatever 
you're thinking, put it out of your mind,' I said.

91
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,880
'Don't confuse me,' he said. 'You know you can 
get away with murder if you're as clever as Celia.  

92
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,240
Don't you think I'm as clever as Celia?'

93
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,440
I held his shoulders. 'Don't 
talk like that, Charlie!'

94
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,160
He pulled away. His eyes were bright 
and his teeth showed behind his lips.  

95
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,440
'What should I do?' he cried. 'Forget 
everything now Jessie is dead and buried?  

96
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,480
Sit here until Celia gets tired of 
being afraid of me and kills me too?'

97
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,960
'You haven't been out of this house since the 
inquest,' I said. 'It's about time you went out.'

98
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,440
'And have everybody laugh at me!' he said.

99
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,960
'Al Sharp said that some of your 
friends would be at his bar tonight,  

100
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,560
and he'd like to see you there,' I said. 
'That's my advice - for whatever it's worth.'

101
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,920
'It's not worth anything,' said Celia. 
The door had opened and she stood there,  

102
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,560
her eyes narrowed against the light in 
the room. Charlie turned towards her.

103
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,480
'I told you never to come 
into this room!' he said.

104
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,840
Her face remained calm. 'I'm not in it. I 
came to tell you that your dinner is ready.'

105
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,240
He took a threatening step towards 
her. 'Did you have your ear at the door  

106
00:10:52,240 --> 00:11:00,000
long enough to hear everything I said?' 
he asked. 'Or shall I repeat it for you?'

107
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,880
'I heard an invitation to go drinking 
while this house is still in mourning,'  

108
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,520
she said, 'and I object to that.'

109
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:18,800
He looked at her, amazed. 'Celia, tell me you 
don't mean that! Only the blackest hypocrite alive  

110
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,240
or someone mad could say what 
you've just said, and mean it.'

111
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,680
'Mad!' she cried. 'You dare use 
that word? Locked in your room,  

112
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,600
talking to yourself.' She turned to me suddenly. 
'You've talked to him. Is it possible-?'

113
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,320
'He's as sane as you, Celia,' I said.

114
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,800
'Then he knows he shouldn't drink in bars at a 
time like this. How could you ask him to do this?'

115
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,440
'If you weren't preparing to throw out 
Jessie's things, Celia,' I said, 'I would  

116
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,840
take that question seriously.' It was a dangerous 
thing to say, and I immediately regretted it.  

117
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,680
Before I could move, Charlie was past 
me and was holding Celia's arms tightly.

118
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,480
'Did you dare go into her room?' he shouted, 
shaking her. And getting an immediate answer  

119
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,720
from her face, he dropped her arms as if they 
were red hot, and stood there with his head down.  

120
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,080
'Where are her things?'

121
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,800
'By the stairs, Charlie. Everything is there.'

122
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,240
He walked out of the room, and 
Celia turned to look at me.  

123
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,840
There was such terrible hatred in her face that 
I desperately wanted to get out of that house.  

124
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,840
I took my things from the bed, but 
she stood in front of the door.

125
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,880
'Do you see what you've done?' she said in 
a rough whisper. 'Now I will have to pack  

126
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:56,080
them all again - just because of you. You old 
fool! It should have been you with her when I-'

127
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,680
I dropped my stick sharply on her shoulder. 
'As your lawyer, Celia,' I said, 'I advise  

128
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,320
you to speak only during your sleep, when you 
can't be made responsible for what you say.'

129
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,120
She said no more, but I made sure 
she stayed safely in front of me  

130
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,800
until I was out in the street again.

131
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,200
It was only a few minutes walk to Al 
Sharp's bar, and I was grateful for  

132
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,200
the clear winter air in my face. Al was 
alone behind the bar, polishing glasses.

133
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,840
'Merry Christmas,' he said, and put a 
comfortable-looking bottle and two glasses  

134
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:44,160
on the bar. 'I was expecting you.' Al poured two 
drinks. We drank, and he leaned across the bar.  

135
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,840
'Just come from there?'

136
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,440
'Yes,' I said.

137
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,240
'See Charlie?'

138
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,360
'And Celia,' I said.

139
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,960
'I've seen her too when she goes by 
to do some shopping,' he said. 'Runs  

140
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,400
along with her head down, as if she's being 
chased by something. And I guess she is.'

141
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
'I guess she is, too,' I said.

142
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,840
'Did you tell Charlie I'd 
like to see him some time?'

143
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,280
'Yes,' I said. 'I told him!'

144
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,360
'What did he say?'

145
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:30,240
'Nothing. Celia said it was wrong for him 
to come here while he was in mourning.'

146
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,240
Al whistled softly, and moved a finger in 
circles at his forehead in a silent, 'crazy!'.

147
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:45,360
'Tell me,' he said, 'do you think it's safe for 
them to be alone together? The way things are,  

148
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,560
the way Charlie feels, there 
could be more trouble there.'

149
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,720
'It looked like that for a while tonight,' 
I said. 'But then it calmed down.'

150
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,880
'Until the next time,' said Al.

151
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,440
'I'll be there,' I said.

152
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,960
Al looked at me and shook his head.  

153
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,800
'Nothing changes in that house,' he said. 
'That's how you can work out all the answers.  

154
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,160
That's how I knew you'd be standing 
here now talking to me about it.'

155
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,240
I could still smell the dampness of the house,  

156
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,840
and I knew it would take days 
to get it out of my clothes.

157
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,680
'This is one day I'd like to take 
out of the year permanently,' I said.

158
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,480
'And leave them alone with 
their problems,' agreed Al.

159
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,240
'They're not alone,' I said. 'Jessie is with them.  

160
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,160
Jessie will always be with them until 
that house and everything in it is gone.'

161
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,960
Al frowned.

162
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,120
'It's the strangest thing that ever 
happened in this town. The house  

163
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,800
all black, her running through the streets 
like something hunted, him lying there in  

164
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,960
that room with only the walls to look at, for 
-how long? When was it Jessie had that fall?'

165
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,560
By moving my eyes a little I could see my face 
in the mirror behind Al: red, deeply lined,  

166
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:32,320
a little amazed. 'Twenty years,' I heard myself 
saying. 'Just twenty years ago tonight.'
 
 

167
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,856
- THE END -
