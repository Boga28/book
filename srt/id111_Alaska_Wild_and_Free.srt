00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,510
CHAPTER ONE
Welcome to Alaska

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,250
WHERE IS ALASKA?

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,710
HOW BIG IS IT?

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,390
WHO LIVES THERE?

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,490
Eskimos first lived in Alaska more than 7,000
years ago.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,550
Today, about 16% of all Alaskans are Eskimos.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,999
These people are really three groups: the
Inupiaq, the Yupik, and the Alutiiq.

8
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:31,670
These groups are not very different, but they
speak different languages.

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,540
Alaska was a part of Russia for a long time.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,890
Then in 1867, the United States bought it
from Russia for $7.2 million.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,329
Many people thought this was too much money.

12
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:48,120
But in the late 1840s, the Americans found
gold in Alaska.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,230
Then in 1901, they found some oil there.

14
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,500
Later, in the 1950s, they found lots of oil.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,359
Alaska is a very big place.

16
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,839
It's the biggest state - more than twice as
big as Texas, the next biggest state.

17
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:05,440
But not many people live there.

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,150
Over 8 million people live in New York City,
but only 730,000 live in all of Alaska.

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,180
And about half of them live in the city of
Anchorage.

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,320
Alaska has many mountains and glaciers.

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,410
A glacier is like a river of ice.

22
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,750
The Matanuska glacier is one of the most beautiful.

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,310
The winters are freezing with a lot of snow
storms.

24
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,820
In winter, it is also very dark because there
is no sun in the far northern part of the

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:40,320
state, and in other areas, it comes out for
only two to seven hours every day.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,150
CHAPTER TWO
Visit Kodiak Island

27
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,530
There is a lot of outdoor fun on Kodiak island.

28
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,860
Kodiak Island is in the southern part of Alaska.

29
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,250
It is the second largest island in the United
States, but it has less than 160 kilometers

30
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,880
of roads.

31
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,100
There are lots of high mountains, green forests,
rivers, and lakes.

32
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,090
About 30,000 visitors come to Kodiak every
year.

33
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:14,410
They come to climb mountains, catch fish,
watch whales jump in the sea, and go camping.

34
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,450
Bear watching is also very popular.

35
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,160
The island gets its name from the big Kodiak
bear.

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,380
There are over 3,500 of these wonderful animals
living in the forests.

37
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,320
But you must be very quiet if you want to
see one!

38
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,080
About 13,000 people live on Kodiak Island
all year, and half of them live in Kodiak

39
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,330
City.

40
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,870
The others live in small villages by the sea.

41
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,140
The Alutiiq people were the first to live
on the island.

42
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,740
They came 7,500 years ago and they stayed.

43
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,980
Today, about 17 percent of all the people
on Kodiak Island are Alutiiqs.

44
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,590
They speak English and Alutiiq.

45
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,750
In 2010, only 50 people spoke the Alutiiq
language!

46
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,280
But now schools are teaching the language
because they don't want it to die.

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,410
The most important businesses here are fishing
and tourism.

48
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:15,630
There are seven hotels, 17 places to eat,
and many shops in Kodiak City.

49
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,880
The shops sell things made on the island.

50
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,010
CHAPTER THREE
Enjoy Outside Sports

51
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,540
DO YOU LOVE DOING SPORTS OUTSIDE?

52
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,770
THEN ALASKA IS THE PLACE FOR YOU.

53
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:35,160
Many tourists come to Alaska to enjoy walking
outside in the clean, cold air.

54
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,130
And they come to do extreme sports - sports
that are exciting but also dangerous.

55
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,210
Some people come to Alaska to climb Mount
McKinley in Denali National Park.

56
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:53,020
This mountain is 6,194 meters high, the highest
in North America.

57
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,300
It isn't easy to climb to the top of Mount
McKinley.

58
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,490
It takes about three weeks!

59
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,830
It's really cold when you get to the top,
so most people stay there for only a short

60
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,160
time.

61
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,410
You need very warm clothes.

62
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,130
And you must be careful.

63
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,660
Between 1932 and 2012, 120 climbers died on
the mountain.

64
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,910
In June 2012, four Japanese climbers died
in an avalanche.

65
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,859
Whitewater rafting is also a popular sport.

66
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:28,050
The Nenana River, also in Denali National
Park, is very fast in some places.

67
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,610
Mount Alyeska is a good place to go paragliding.

68
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,689
Don't worry if you don't know how to paraglide.

69
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:38,080
A teacher goes on the paraglider with you
so you can enjoy the beautiful mountain and

70
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,750
forests below you.

71
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,270
Skiing is popular in Alaska.

72
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,270
There is a lot of snow and there are many
good places to ski.

73
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,650
Eagle Crest, only 20 kilometers from the state
capital, Juneau, is an excellent mountain

74
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,229
for skiing.

75
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,940
There are many other interesting things to
do in Alaska.

76
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,469
Some of these are less exciting than paragliding
or whitewater rafting, but they are great

77
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,770
fun:

78
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,900
-look for gold in the rivers in the Kenai
Peninsula

79
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,270
-fly over the glaciers in a plane or a helicopter

80
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,830
-visit the Sea Life Center in Seward.

81
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,219
You can see wonderful sea animals only a meter
from where you are standing.

82
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:22,930
Some people enjoy traveling across Alaska
as well.

83
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:33,069
In 2010, Andrew Skurka traveled 7,600 kilometers
across Alaska and the Yukon in 176 days.

84
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:36,210
That's 43 kilometers a day!

85
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,120
Most of the time he walked.

86
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,439
He used six pairs of boots!

87
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,419
But he also went on rivers on a raft, and
he skied, too.

88
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,409
He slept in a tent.

89
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:51,960
When Andrew skied in Denali Park, he was very
worried about avalanches and snowstorms.

90
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,969
He didn't see any avalanches, but one night,
there was a really bad storm and his tent

91
00:05:56,969 --> 00:05:58,460
blew away!

92
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,339
Andrew has traveled 48,000 kilometers in his
life, and he doesn't want to stop.

93
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:10,520
When he isn't working, he writes books about
his travels.

94
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,159
CHAPTER FOUR
The Iditarod

95
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:18,729
IN THE PAST, ALASKANS NEEDED TO USE DOGS AND
SLEDS TO TRAVEL.

96
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:19,869
NOW THEY DON'T.

97
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:25,490
BUT IN 1973, A DOGSLED RACE BEGAN, THE IDITAROD.

98
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,449
The Iditarod is a really hard race.

99
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:34,740
The dogsled teams have to travel about 1,600
kilometers, from Anchorage to Nome.

100
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:42,150
And the weather can be very bad, with freezing
temperatures of -20C and dangerous snow storms.

101
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,960
Each team has one person, called a musher,
and 12 to 20 dogs.

102
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,099
The mushers have to think about many things.

103
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:55,060
When is the best time to travel, at night
or in the day?

104
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,169
What clothes are best to wear?

105
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:59,729
What food is best for the dogs?

106
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:02,919
When is the best time to put the boots on
the dogs?

107
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,610
If the dogs don't wear boots, the ice can
cut their feet.

108
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,639
It usually takes 10 to 15 days to finish the
Iditarod.

109
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,289
The team that gets to Nome first wins!

110
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:20,909
John Baker did the Iditarod in the fastest
time in 2011 - 8 days and 19 hours.

111
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:27,610
Carl Huntington did the slowest time in 1974
- 20 days and 15 hours.

112
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,039
The Iditarod is very popular.

113
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:32,659
It's an important part of Alaskan life.

114
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:36,339
Before the race starts, there's a big party
in Anchorage.

115
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:39,800
Then, thousands of people watch the race.

116
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,580
Many more people follow it for days on TV,
the Internet, or in newspapers.

117
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,479
In the first Iditarod, there were 34 teams.

118
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,770
Now every year in March about 55 teams do
the race.

119
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,870
Why is it so popular?

120
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:02,499
Maybe because the winner gets a lot of money
- about $50,000!

121
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:07,429
CHAPTER FIVE
Green Tourism in Alaska

122
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:09,789
TOURISTS CAN BE VERY GOOD FOR COUNTRIES.

123
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,429
BUT TOURISTS CAN ALSO BRING PROBLEMS.

124
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:14,589
Tourists spend a lot of money.

125
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:20,270
They stay at hotels, eat in restaurants, and
buy things in shops.

126
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,479
This is good for Alaska and its people.

127
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,249
But a lot of people in one place can make
a lot of noise.

128
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:30,529
And that can be difficult for Alaska's animals.

129
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:35,590
And tourists leave trash in the forests and
rivers, and in the sea.

130
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,880
Animals and fish can eat this trash and get
sick.

131
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,669
The people at the Alaskan tourist office want
the state to stay clean.

132
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,649
They want the animals to be safe and to live
their normal lives.

133
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:51,850
This is why they want people to do "green
tourism."

134
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,490
Green tourism doesn't hurt the forests, the
rivers, the sea, or the animals that live

135
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,880
in them.

136
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,480
Green tourists don't travel in big groups.

137
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,200
They go around in small groups, so they don't
disturb the animals.

138
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,019
And the tourist office asks people to take
their trash with them when they leave.

139
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,550
Many tourists in Alaska take boat trips to
see life in the sea.

140
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,759
Whales are their favorite animal.

141
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:21,630
The tourists go out on small boats and travel
slowly and quietly.

142
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,699
This way, they do not disturb the whales and
the fish.

143
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,810
CHAPTER SIX
The City of Anchorage

144
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,430
ANCHORAGE BEGAN AS A CITY OF TENTS IN 1915.

145
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:42,060
From 1915 to 1923, people went to live in
Alaska to help build the railroad.

146
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,680
At that time, about 2,000 people lived in
Anchorage.

147
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,639
They all lived in tents, but only one tent
had a bath in it!

148
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:56,370
By 1940, Anchorage had about 4,000 people,
and in 2012, Anchorage was the biggest city

149
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,130
in Alaska with 300,000 people.

150
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,220
Anchorage is small, quiet, and pretty.

151
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,209
Normally it's a safe place, too.

152
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,209
But it wasn't on March 27, 1964.

153
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,550
That was a bad day in Anchorage.

154
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,829
The ground under everyone's feet started to
move.

155
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,850
It didn't stop moving for four minutes.

156
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,199
Houses fell and 115 people died.

157
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:28,190
It was an earthquake, a big earthquake, the
second biggest earthquake in the world.

158
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,149
Today, Anchorage is an interesting city.

159
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,960
During the day, you can visit the Anchorage
Museum.

160
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,910
You can learn about the Eskimo people and
life in the town many years ago.

161
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,500
There are also many places to look at different
kinds of art.

162
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,980
The H2Oasis Waterpark is a fun place to take
