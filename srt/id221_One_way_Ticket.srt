00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,241
The Girl with Green Eyes

2
00:00:02,241 --> 00:00:12,240
'Of course,' the man in the brown hat said,
'there are good policemen and there are bad

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,290
policemen, you know.'

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:24,150
'You're right,' the young man said. 'Yes.
That's very true. Isn't it, Julie?' He looked

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,609
at the young woman next to him.

6
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:33,990
Julie didn't answer and looked bored. She
closed her eyes.

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:40,940
'Julie's my wife,' the young man told the
man in the brown hat. 'She doesn't like trains.

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,210
She always feels ill on trains.'

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:55,150
'Oh yes?' the man in the brown hat said. 'Now
my wife - she doesn't like buses. She nearly

10
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:03,960
had an accident on a bus once. It was last
year... No, no, it wasn't. It was two years

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:13,670
ago. I remember now. It was in Manchester.'
He told a long, boring story about his wife

12
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,090
and a bus in Manchester.

13
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:25,119
It was a hot day and the train was slow. There
were seven people in the carriage. There was

14
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:33,579
the man in the brown hat; the young man and
his wife, Julie; a mother and two children;

15
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:38,600
and a tall dark man in an expensive suit.

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:48,039
The young man's name was Bill. He had short
brown hair and a happy smile. His wife, Julie,

17
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:56,229
had long red hair and very green eyes - the
colour of sea water. They were very beautiful

18
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,399
eyes.

19
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:06,990
The man in the brown hat talked and talked.
He had a big red face and a loud voice. He

20
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:14,370
talked to Bill because Bill liked to talk
too. The man in the brown hat laughed a lot,

21
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:23,060
and when he laughed, Bill laughed too. Bill
liked talking and laughing with people.

22
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:30,190
The two children were hot and bored. They
didn't want to sit down. They wanted to be

23
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,220
noisy and run up and down the train.

24
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:43,360
'Now sit down and be quiet,' their mother
said. She was a small woman with a tired face

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,580
and a tired voice.

26
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:54,340
'I don't want to sit down,' the little boy
said. 'I'm thirsty.'

27
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:02,290
'Here. Have an orange,' his mother said. She
took an orange out of her bag and gave it

28
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,950
to him.

29
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:09,340
'I want an orange too, the little girl said
loudly.

30
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:18,090
'All right. Here you are,' said her mother.
'Eat it nicely, now.'

31
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,170
The children ate their oranges and were quiet
for a minute.

32
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:31,970
Then the little boy said, 'I want a drink.
I'm thirsty.'

33
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:41,290
The tall dark man took out his newspaper and
began to read. Julie opened her eyes and looked

34
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:48,480
at the back page of his newspaper. She read
about the weather in Budapest and about the

35
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:56,220
football in Liverpool. She wasn't interested
in Budapest and she didn't like football,

36
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:04,700
but she didn't want to listen to Bill and
the man in the brown hat. 'Talk, talk, talk,'

37
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,950
she thought. 'Bill never stops talking.'

38
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:18,509
Then suddenly she saw the tall man's eyes
over the top of his newspaper. She could not

39
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:27,499
see his mouth, but there was a smile in his
eyes. Quickly, she looked down at the newspaper

40
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:32,250
and read about the weather in Budapest again.

41
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:42,249
The train stopped at Dawlish station and people
got on and got off. There was a lot of noise.

42
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:49,409
'Is this our station?' the little girl asked.
She went to the window and looked out.

43
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:56,150
'No, it isn't. Now sit down,' her mother said.

44
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:03,819
'We're going to Penzance,' the little girl
told Bill. 'For our holidays.'

45
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:14,189
'Yes,' her mother said. 'My sister's got a
little hotel by the sea. We're staying there.

46
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,379
It's cheap, you see.'

47
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:26,380
'Yes,' the man in the brown hat said. 'It's
a nice town. I know a man there. He's got

48
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:34,440
a restaurant in King Street. A lot of holiday
people go there. He makes a lot of money in

49
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:43,050
the summer.' He laughed loudly. 'Yes,' he
said again. 'You can have a nice holiday in

50
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,060
Penzance.'

51
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:55,220
'We're going to St Austell,' Bill. said. 'Me
and Julie. It's our first holiday. Julie wanted

52
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:05,059
to go to Spain, but I like St Austell. I always
go there for my holidays. It's nice in August.

53
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:09,680
You can have a good time there too.'

54
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:19,539
Julie looked out of the window. 'Where is
Budapest?' she thought. 'I want to go there.

55
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:29,300
I want to go to Vienna, to Paris, to Rome,
to Athens.' Her green eyes were bored and

56
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:37,509
angry. Through the window she watched the
little villages and hills of England.

57
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:45,070
The man in the brown hat looked at Julie.
'You're right,' he said to Bill. 'You can

58
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:53,550
have a good time on holiday in England. We
always go to Brighton, me and the wife. But

59
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:03,630
the weather! We went one year, and it rained
every day. Morning, afternoon, and night.

60
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:12,240
It's true. It never stopped raining.' He laughed
loudly. 'We nearly went home after the first

61
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
week.'

62
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:21,309
Bill laughed too. 'What did you do all day,
then?' he asked.

63
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:28,680
Julie read about the weather in Budapest for
the third time. Then she looked at the tall

64
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:39,319
man's hands. They were long, brown hands,
very clean. 'Nice hands,' she thought. He

65
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:49,790
wore a very expensive Japanese watch. 'Japan,'
she thought. 'I'd like to go to Japan.' She

66
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:57,300
looked up and saw the man's eyes again over
the top of his newspaper. This time she did

67
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:07,139
not look away. Green eyes looked into dark
brown eyes for a long, slow minute.

68
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:16,629
After Newton Abbot station the guard came
into the carriage to look at their tickets.

69
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:23,389
'Now then,' he said, 'where are we all going?'

70
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:31,969
'This train's late,' the man in the brown
hat said. 'Twenty minutes late, by my watch.'

71
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:42,060
'Ten minutes,' the guard said. 'That's all.'
He smiled at Julie.

72
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:50,260
The tall dark man put his newspaper down,
found his ticket, and gave it to the guard.

73
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,120
The guard looked at it.

74
00:08:52,120 --> 00:09:01,100
'You're all right, sir,' he said. 'The boat
doesn't leave Plymouth before six o'clock.

75
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,990
You've got lots of time.'

76
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:12,810
The tall man smiled, put his ticket back in
his pocket and opened his newspaper again.

77
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:21,860
Julie didn't look at him. 'A boat,' she thought.
'He's taking a boat from Plymouth. Where's

78
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:29,130
he going?' She looked at him again with her
long green eyes.

79
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:37,660
He read his newspaper and didn't look at her.
But his eyes smiled.

80
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,950
The train stopped at Totnes station and more
people got on and off.

81
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:54,100
'Everybody's going on holiday,' Bill said.
He laughed. 'It's going to be wonderful. No

82
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:02,750
work for two weeks. It's a nice, quiet town,
St Austell. We can stay in bed in the mornings,

83
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:10,290
and sit and talk in the afternoons, and have
a drink or two in the evenings. Eh, Julie?'

84
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:16,209
He looked at his wife. 'Are you all right,
Julie?'

85
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:25,680
'Yes, Bill,' she said quietly. 'I'm OK.' She
looked out of the window again. The train

86
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,560
went more quickly now, and it began to rain.
Bill and the man in the brown hat talked and

87
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:41,860
talked. Bill told a long story about two men
and a dog, and the man in the brown hat laughed

88
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,420
very loudly.

89
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:54,209
'That's a good story,' he said. 'I like that.
You tell it very well. Do you know the story

90
00:10:54,209 --> 00:11:00,149
about...' And he told Bill a story about a
Frenchman and a bicycle.

91
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:09,600
'Why do people laugh at these stories?' Julie
thought. 'They're so boring!'

92
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:18,240
But Bill liked it. Then he told a story about
an old woman and a cat, and the man in the

93
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:30,410
brown hat laughed again. 'That's good, too.
I don't know. How do you remember them all?'

94
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,980
'Because', Julie thought, 'he tells them every
day.'

95
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:45,750
'I don't understand,' the little girl said
suddenly. She looked at Bill. 'Why did the

96
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,590
cat die?'

97
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:55,629
'Shhh. Be quiet,' her mother said. 'Come and
eat your sandwiches now.'

98
00:11:55,629 --> 00:12:02,589
That's all right,' Bill said. 'I like children.'

99
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:13,060
The man in the brown hat looked at the children's
sandwiches. 'Mmm, I'm hungry, too,' he said.

100
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:20,280
'You can get sandwiches in the restaurant
on this train.' He looked at Bill 'Let's go

101
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,899
down to the restaurant, eh? I need a drink
too.'

102
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:33,769
Bill laughed. 'You're right. It's thirsty
work, telling stories.'

103
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:37,950
The two men stood up and left the carriage.

104
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:46,480
The little girl ate her sandwich and looked
at Julie. 'But why did the cat die?' she asked.

105
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,940
'I don't know,' Julie said. 'Perhaps it wanted
to die.'

106
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:02,839
The little girl came and sat next to Julie.
'I like your hair,' she said. 'It's beautiful.'

107
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,250
Julie looked down at her and smiled.

108
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:15,959
For some minutes it was quiet in the carriage.
Then the tall dark man opened his bag and

109
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:24,970
took out a book. He put it on the seat next
to him, and looked at Julie with a smile.

110
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:33,259
Julie looked back at him, and then down at
the book. Famous towns of Italy, she read.

111
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:43,779
Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples. She looked
away again, out of the window at the rain.

112
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:52,639
Two weeks in St Austell,' she thought. 'With
Bill - In the rain.'

113
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,060
After half an hour the two men came back to
the carriage. 'There are a lot of people on

114
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,870
this train,' Bill said. 'Do you want a sandwich,
Julie?'

115
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:11,779
'No,' she said. 'I'm not hungry. You eat them.'

116
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:20,339
The train was nearly at Plymouth. Doors opened
and people began to move. 'A lot of people

117
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,800
get on here,' the man in the brown hat said.

118
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:33,269
The tall dark man stood up and put his book
and his newspaper in his bag. Then he picked

119
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:41,510
up his bag and left the carriage. The train
stopped at the station. A lot of people got

120
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:48,290
on the train, and two women and an old man
came into the carriage. They had a lot of

121
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:57,720
bags with them. Bill and the man in the brown
hat stood up and helped them. One of the women

122
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:05,880
had a big bag of apples. The bag broke and
the apples went all over the carriage.

123
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,110
'Oh damn!' she said.

124
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:17,980
Everybody laughed, and helped her to find
the apples. The train moved away from Plymouth

125
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:26,800
station. After a minute or two everybody sat
down and the woman gave some apples to the

126
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,580
children.

127
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:37,389
'Where's Julie?' Bill said suddenly. 'She's
not here.'

128
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:42,360
'Perhaps she went to the restaurant,' the
man in the brown hat said.

129
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:49,490
'But she wasn't hungry,' Bill said. 'She told
me.'

130
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:57,600
The little girl looked at Bill. 'She got off
the train at Plymouth,' she said. 'With the

131
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,149
tall dark man. I saw them.'

132
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:08,779
'Of course she didn't!' Bill said. 'She's
on this train. She didn't get off.'

133
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:17,830
'Yes, she did,' the children's mother said
suddenly. 'I saw her too. The tall man waited

134
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,180
for her on the platform.'

135
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:30,620
'He waited for her?' Bill's mouth was open.
'But... But he read his newspaper all the

136
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:41,139
time. He didn't talk to Julie. And she never
talked to him. They didn't say a word.'

137
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:47,839
'People don't always need words, young man,'
the children's mother said.

138
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:58,449
'But she's my wife!' Bill's face was red and
angry. 'She can't do that!' he said loudly.

139
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:06,490
He stood up. 'I'm going to stop the train,'
Everybody looked at him and the two children

140
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,209
laughed.

141
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:17,350
'No,' the man in the brown hat said, 'no,
you don't want to do that. Sit down and eat

142
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,730
your sandwiches, my friend.'

143
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:33,600
'But I don't understand. Why did she go? What
am I going to do?' Bill's face was very unhappy.

144
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:43,450
After a second or two he sat down again. 'What
am I going to do?' he said again.

145
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:52,870
'Nothing,' the man in the brown hat said.
He ate his sandwich slowly. 'Go and have your

146
00:17:52,870 --> 00:18:01,251
holiday in St Austell. You can have a good
time there. Forget about Julie. Those green

147
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:10,740
eyes, now.' He took out a second sandwich
and began to eat it. 'I knew a woman once

148
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:29,360
with green eyes. She gave me a very bad time.
No, you want to forget about Julie.'

149
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
South for the Winter

150
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:43,150
I never stay in one country for a long time.
It gets boring. I like to move on, see new

151
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:52,799
places, meet different people. It's a good
life, most of the time. When I need money,

152
00:18:52,799 --> 00:19:02,610
I get a job. I can do most things - hotel
and restaurant work, building work, picking

153
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:11,669
fruit. In Europe you can pick fruit most of
the year. You need to be in the right country

154
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:19,490
at the right time, of course. It's not easy
work, but the money's not bad.

155
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:28,760
I like to go south in the winter. Life is
easier in the sun, and northern Europe can

156
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:40,821
get very cold in the winter. Last year, 1989
it was, I was in Venice for October. I did

157
00:19:40,821 --> 00:19:49,860
some work in a hotel for three weeks, then
I began slowly to move south. I always go

158
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:59,380
by train when I can. I like trains. You can
walk about on a train, and you meet a lot

159
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,679
of people.

160
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:11,260
I left Venice and went on to Trieste. There
I got a cheap ticket for the slow train to

161
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:20,080
Sofia, in Bulgaria. This train goes all down
through Yugoslavia, and takes a long time

162
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,909
- a day and a half. But that didn't matter
to me.

163
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:33,750
The train left Trieste at nine o'clock on
a Thursday morning. There weren't many people

164
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:43,000
on it at first, but at Zagreb more people
got on. Two girls went along the corridor,

165
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,980
past my carriage. They looked through the
door, but they didn't come in. Then an old

166
00:20:50,980 --> 00:21:00,309
woman came in, sat down and went to sleep.
The two girls came back along the corridor

167
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:08,210
and looked into the carriage again. The train
left Zagreb and I looked out of the window

168
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:14,690
for about ten minutes, then I went to sleep
too.

169
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:22,110
When I opened my eyes again, the two girls
were in the carriage. They looked friendly,

170
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,080
so I said, 'Hullo.'

171
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,880
'Hi!' they said.

172
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,190
'You're American,' I said. 'Or Canadian. Right?'

173
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:42,480
'American,' the taller girl said. She smiled.
'And you're twenty-three, your name's Tom

174
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:52,100
Walsh, you've got blue eyes, and your mum
lives in Burnham-on-Sea, UK. Right?'

175
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,580
'How did you know all that?' I asked.

176
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:03,649
The second girl laughed. 'She looked at your
passport. It's in your coat pocket.'

177
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:14,390
'Oh. Right.' My coat was on the seat next
to me. I took my passport out of my pocket

178
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:20,840
and put it back in my bag. 'Who are you, then?'
I asked.

179
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:31,610
They told me. Melanie and Carol from Los Angeles,
USA. They liked Europe, they said. They knew

180
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:44,919
a lot of places - Britain, Holland, Denmark,
Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Yugoslavia,

181
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:46,830
Bulgaria, Greece...

182
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:56,840
'I'm going to Bulgaria now,' I said. For about
a month. Then I'm going south for the winter,

183
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,080
Cyprus, or perhaps North Africa.'

184
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:08,149
'Oh yes?' they said. 'We love Bulgaria. Sofia's
a great town. Wonderful.'

185
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:13,340
'What do you do about money?' I asked,

186
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:23,149
'Well, you know,' Carol smiled. 'Sometimes
we get a little job. This and that. But what

187
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:24,789
about you?'

188
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:34,220
'Yeah, come on,' Melanie said. 'Tell us about
you - Tom Walsh with the blue eyes and the

189
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:40,700
mum in Burnham-on-Sea. What are you doing
with your life, hey?'

190
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:48,320
So I told them. They were nice girls. They
were older than me, perhaps twenty-seven or

191
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:56,350
twenty-eight, but I liked them. We talked
and laughed for hours. I told them a lot of

192
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:05,270
stories about my life. Some of the stories
were true, some weren't. But the girls laughed,

193
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:13,659
and said I was a great guy. I asked them about
Bulgaria, because I didn't know the country.

194
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:17,279
They knew Sofia well, they said.

195
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:25,840
'Hey, Carol,' Melanie said. 'We're staying
in Bela Palanka for a day or two. But let's

196
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:33,740
go over to Sofia this weekend and meet Tom
there. We can meet him on Saturday night at

197
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,430
the Hotel Marmara.'

198
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:45,650
'Yeah! It's a good hotel,' Carol told me.
'Cheap, but good. What do you think, Tom?'

199
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,230
'Great!' I said. 'Let's do that.'

200
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:58,429
The train was very slow. We got to Belgrade
at six o'clock in the evening, and a lot of

201
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:06,440
people got off. There were only me and the
girls in the carriage then. The guard came

202
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,630
and looked at our tickets, and went away again.

203
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:21,930
Carol looked at Melanie. 'Hey, Mel,' she said.
'Why don't you and Tom go along to the restaurant?

204
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:27,750
I'm not hungry, and I want to sleep for an
hour.'

205
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:36,220
'Er... Food's very expensive on the train,'
I said. 'I haven't got much money just now.

206
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,919
I'm going to get a job in Sofia.'

207
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:49,210
'Oh Tom!' Melanie said. 'Why didn't you tell
us? Look, you're a nice guy, right? We're

208
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,090
OK for money this week. We can buy you a meal.'

209
00:25:53,090 --> 00:26:02,820
'Of course we can,' Carol said. 'And look,
in Sofia, we can take you to the best restaurant

210
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,840
in town. It's a great place. We love it.'

211
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:17,320
What could I say? I was hungry. They had money,
I didn't. So Melanie and I went to the restaurant

212
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:25,899
and had a meal. When we came back, Carol was
still alone in the carriage. Melanie put her

213
00:26:25,899 --> 00:26:28,940
feet on the seat and went to sleep.

214
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:38,179
At Nis some more people got on the train,
and two old men came into our carriage. They

215
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:45,580
looked at Melanie's feet on the seat, and
talked in loud voices. Carol laughed, and

216
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,909
Melanie opened her eyes and sat up.

217
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:56,220
'Are we nearly there?' she asked Carol, and
looked out of the window.

218
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,120
'Yeah. About half an hour, I think.'

219
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:08,429
'Why are you getting off at Bela Palanka?'
I asked. 'What are you going to do there?'

220
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:17,570
Melanie smiled. 'Find a cheap hotel, meet
people, take a look at the town... you know.'

221
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,929
'Just for a day or two,' Carol said.

222
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:22,750
'But there's nothing there!'

223
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:32,430
'Oh well, you never know,' Melanie laughed.
'See you in Sofia, right? On Saturday night.'

224
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:40,820
'The Hotel Marmara, OK? Eight o'clock,' Carol
said. 'Don't forget now!'

225
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,580
'OK. Great,' I said. 'See you there.'

226
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:54,960
The train came into Bela Palanka and stopped.
The two girls got off and stood on the platform.

227
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,720
They smiled at me through the window. 'Saturday.
Eight o'clock,' Melanie shouted.

228
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:11,350
'OK,' I called. They couldn't hear me because
of the noise in the station. They smiled again,

229
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:21,230
picked up their bags and walked away. Nice
girls. I'm going to have a great time in Sofia,

230
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,750
I thought.

231
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:31,429
The train left Yugoslavia and crossed into
Bulgaria at two o'clock in the morning. Then

232
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:38,539
the train stopped at some village - I don't
remember the name. I ate an apple and looked

233
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:39,830
out of the window.

234
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:48,039
Suddenly there were a lot of policemen on
the train. Everybody in the carriage sat up

235
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,610
and began to talk.

236
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:55,640
'What's happening?' I said in Italian to the
old man next to me.

237
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:05,851
'I don't know,' he said in bad Italian. 'Perhaps
they're looking for somebody. Look. The police

238
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:10,519
are taking some people off the train.'

239
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:18,970
Then two policemen came into our carriage,
a tall thin one and a short fat one. They

240
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:24,809
looked at everybody carefully... and then
they looked at me again.

241
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:31,269
'Come with us, please,' the fat policeman
said in English.

242
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:37,740
'What? Me?' I said. 'Why? What's the matter?'

243
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,960
'And bring your bag with you,' the tall policeman
said.

244
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:52,149
I began to ask a question, but policemen never
like questions from young men with long hair.

245
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:59,210
So I stayed quiet, picked up my bag, and went
with them.

246
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:05,350
In the station building there were a lot more
policemen, and some people from the train.

247
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:15,360
They were all young people, I saw. Some were
afraid, some were bored. The police looked

248
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,950
in everybody's bags, and then the people went
back to the train.

249
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:30,519
My two policemen took me to a table. 'Your
passport, please,' the fat policeman said,

250
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:33,500
'and open your bag.'

251
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:41,200
They looked at my passport and I opened my
bag. There was a young policewoman with red

252
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:50,510
hair at the next table. She had a nice face,
so I smiled at her and she smiled back.

253
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:58,990
'Aaah!' the tall policeman said suddenly.
All my dirty shirts and clothes were out on

254
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:08,160
the table. The policeman picked up my bag
and turned it over. On to the table, out of

255
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:20,909
my bag, fell packet after packet of US American
dollars. Nice, new dollars. Fifty-dollar notes

256
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:26,509
in big packets. A lot of money.

257
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:36,679
My mouth opened, and stayed open. I couldn't
find my voice. I was suddenly a very interesting

258
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:43,980
person, and a lot of police ran up to our
table and stood behind me.

259
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:58,600
'50,000... 100,000... 150,000... There's 200,000
dollars here,' the tall policeman said. 'What

260
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,190
an interesting bag, Mr Tom Walsh!'

261
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:12,409
I found my voice again quickly. 'But it's
not my bag!' I shouted.

262
00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:21,200
There was a big, happy smile on that policeman's
face. 'Well,' he said, 'it's got your name

263
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,169
on it. Look!'

264
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:34,429
So I looked, and of course there was my name,
and yes of course, it was my bag. So how did

265
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:40,460
200,000 US dollars get into my bag?

266
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:49,090
'You cannot bring US dollars into this country,'
the fat policeman said. He had very short

267
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:54,980
grey hair and little black eyes. He didn't
smile once.

268
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:03,520
'But I didn't bring them,' I said quickly.
'They're not my dollars. I never saw them

269
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,340
before in my life, and-'

270
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:14,409
There was a lot of noise in the station. I
looked out of the window and saw my train.

271
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,440
Slowly, it began to move.

272
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,399
'Hey! I shouted. 'That's my train-'

273
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:31,679
The tall policeman laughed. It was a great
day for him. 'Oh no,' he said. 'You're not

274
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:41,480
getting back on that train. You're staying
here with us, in our beautiful country.' He

275
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,809
smiled, happily.

276
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:54,040
So I never got to Sofia on Saturday. I was
very unhappy about that. I wanted to have

277
00:33:54,040 --> 00:34:02,029
a little talk with Melanie and Carol, ask
them one or two questions, you know. You're

278
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:11,590
a nice guy, Tom. See you in Sofia, OK? Take
you to the best restaurant in town. Yeah.

279
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,590
Great.

280
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:23,520
And I never got down to Cyprus or North Africa
that winter. Oh well, I live and learn. It's

281
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:32,760
not an easy life, in prison. But it's warm
in winter, and the food's not bad. And I'm

282
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:42,440
meeting some interesting people. There's a
man from Georgia, USSR - Boris, his name is.

283
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:49,679
He comes from a place by the Black Sea. He's
a great guy. When we get out of here, he and

284
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:59,400
I are going down to Australia... Brisbane
perhaps, or Sydney. Get a job on a ship, start

285
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:13,869
a new life. Yeah, next year's going to be
OK.

286
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:18,540
Mr Harris and the Night Train

287
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:26,480
Mr Harris liked trains. He was afraid of aeroplanes,
and didn't like buses. But trains - they were

288
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:34,569
big and noisy and exciting. When he was a
boy often, he liked trains. Now he was a man

289
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:38,790
of fifty, and he still liked trains.

290
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:44,590
So he was a happy man on the night of the
14th of September. He was on the night train

291
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:51,150
from Helsinki to Oulu in Finland, and he had
ten hours in front of him.

292
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:58,869
'I've got a book and my newspaper,' he thought.
'And there's a good restaurant on the train.

293
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:04,700
And then I've got two weeks' holiday with
my Finnish friends in Oulu.'

294
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:10,700
There weren't many people on the train, and
nobody came into Mr Harris's carriage. He

295
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:17,180
was happy about that. Most people on the train
slept through the night, but Mr Harris liked

296
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,270
to look out of the window, and to read and
think.

297
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:28,089
After dinner in the restaurant Mr Harris came
back to his carriage, and sat in his seat

298
00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:34,670
next to the window. For an hour or two he
watched the trees and lakes of Finland out

299
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:41,829
of the window. Then it began to get dark,
so he opened his book and began to read.

300
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:48,990
At midnight the train stopped at the small
station of Otava. Mr Harris looked out of

301
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:56,190
the window, but he saw nobody. The train moved
away from the station, into the black night

302
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:04,391
again. Then the door of Mr Harris's carriage
opened, and two people came in. A young man

303
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:06,670
and a young woman.

304
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:14,500
The young woman was angry. She closed the
door and shouted at the man: 'Carl! You can't

305
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:21,300
do this to me!' The young man laughed loudly
and sat down.

306
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:29,359
Mr Harris was a small, quiet man. He wore
quiet clothes, and he had a quiet voice. He

307
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:37,750
did not like noisy people and loud voices.
So he was not pleased. 'Young people are always

308
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:43,730
noisy,' he thought. 'Why can't they talk quietly?'

309
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:49,670
He put his book down and closed his eyes.
But he could not sleep because the two young

310
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,960
people didn't stop talking.

311
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:00,510
The young woman sat down and said in a quieter
voice: 'Carl, you're my brother and I love

312
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:09,310
you, but please listen to me. You can't take
my diamond necklace. Give it back to me now.

313
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,310
Please!'

314
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:19,650
Carl smiled. 'No, Elena,' he said. 'I'm going
back to Russia soon, and I'm taking your diamonds

315
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:28,240
with me.' He took off his hat and put it on
the seat. 'Elena, listen. You have a rich

316
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:37,520
husband, but I - I have no money. I have nothing!
How can I live without money? You can't give

317
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,339
me money, so I need your diamonds, little
sister.'

318
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:49,171
Mr Harris looked at the young woman. She was
small, with black hair and dark eyes. Her

319
00:38:49,171 --> 00:38:56,990
face was white and afraid. Mr Harris began
to feel sorry for Elena. She and her brother

320
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:02,420
didn't look at him once. 'Can't they see me?'
he thought.

321
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:12,089
'Carl,' Elena said. Her voice was very quiet
now, and Mr Harris listened carefully. 'You

322
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:19,190
came to dinner at our house tonight, and you
went to my room and took my diamond necklace.

323
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:25,770
How could you do that to me? My husband gave
the diamonds to me. They were his mother's

324
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:33,390
diamonds before that. He's going to be very,
very angry - and I'm afraid of him.'

325
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:39,569
Her brother laughed. He put his hand in his
pocket, then took it out again and opened

326
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:48,090
it slowly. The diamond necklace in his hand
was very beautiful. Mr Harris stared at it.

327
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:53,680
For a minute or two nobody moved and it was
quiet in the carriage. There was only the

328
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:00,390
noise of the train, and it went quickly on
through the dark cold night.

329
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:06,319
Mr Harris opened his book again, but he didn't
read it. He watched Carl's face, with its

330
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,750
hungry eyes and its cold smile.

331
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:18,170
'What beautiful, beautiful diamonds!' Carl
said. 'I can get a lot of money for these.'

332
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:25,140
'Give them back to me, Carl,' Elena whispered,
'My husband's going to kill me. You're my

333
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:30,089
brother... Please help me. Please!'

334
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:38,359
Carl laughed again, and Mr Harris wanted to
hit him. 'Go home, little sister,' Carl said.

335
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:45,220
'I'm not going to give the diamonds back to
you. Go home to your angry husband.'

336
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:52,460
Suddenly there was a knife in the young woman's
hand. A long, bright knife. Mr Harris watched

337
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,410
with his mouth open. He couldn't speak or
move.

338
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:03,680
'Give the diamonds back to me!' Elena cried.
'Or I'm going to kill you!' Her hand on the

339
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,059
knife was white.

340
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:15,609
Carl laughed and laughed. 'What a sister!'
he said. 'What a kind, sweet sister! No, they're

341
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:21,950
my diamonds now. Put your knife away, little
sister.'

342
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:27,700
But the knife in the white hand moved quickly:
up, then down. There was a long, terrible

343
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:34,819
cry, and Carl's body fell slowly on to the
seat. The colour of the seat began to change

344
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:40,329
to red, and the diamond necklace fell from
Carl's hand on to the floor.

345
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:51,579
Elena's face was white. 'Oh no!' she whispered.
'Carl! Come back... come back! I didn't want

346
00:41:51,579 --> 00:42:00,050
to kill you!' But Carl didn't answer, and
the red blood ran slowly over the floor. Elena

347
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:06,069
put her head in her hands, and again in the
carriage there was a long, terrible cry.

348
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:12,800
Mr Harris's face was white too. He opened
his mouth, but he couldn't speak. He stood

349
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:20,319
up, and carefully moved to the door. The young
woman was quiet now. She didn't move or look

350
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,790
up at Mr Harris.

351
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:28,690
In the corridor, Mr Harris ran. The guard
was at the hack of the train and Mr Harris

352
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,330
got there in half a minute.

353
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:39,640
'Quickly!' Mr Harris said. 'Come quickly!
An accident... a young woman... oh dear! Her

354
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,380
brother is... is dead!'

355
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:51,589
The guard ran with Mr Harris back to the carriage.
Mr Harris opened the door and they went inside.

356
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:59,550
There was no dead body of a young man. There
was no young woman... no blood, no knife,

357
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:05,950
no diamond necklace. Only Mr Harris's bags
and his hat and coat.

358
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:10,859
The guard looked at Mr Harris, and Mr Harris
looked at him.

359
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:20,441
'But...' Mr Harris began. 'But they were here!
I saw them! She... the young woman... She

360
00:43:20,441 --> 00:43:25,030
had a knife and she... she killed her brother.'

361
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:29,140
'A knife, you say?' the guard asked.

362
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:37,080
'Yes,' Mr Harris said quickly. 'A long knife,
and her brother took her diamonds, so she-'

363
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:45,500
'Ah! Diamonds! the guard said. 'Was the young
woman's name Elena?' he asked.

364
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:55,540
'Yes, it was!' Mr Harris said. 'How do you
know that? Do you... Do you know her?'

365
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:05,750
'Yes - and no,' the guard said slowly. He
thought for a minute, then looked at Mr Harris.

366
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:15,711
'Elena di Saronelli,' he said. 'She had dark
eyes and black hair. Very beautiful. She was

367
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:23,109
half-Italian, half-Finnish. Her brother was
a half- brother. They had the same father,

368
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:27,599
but his mother was Russian, I think.'

369
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:38,040
'Was? Had?' Mr Harris stared at the guard.
'But she... Elena... she's alive! And where

370
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,220
is she?'

371
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:47,890
'Oh no,' said the guard. 'Elena di Saronelli
died about eighty years ago. After she killed

372
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:54,890
her brother with a knife, she jumped off the
train, and died at once. It was near here,

373
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:59,619
I think.' He looked out of the window, into
the night.

374
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:08,369
Mr Harris's face was very white again. 'Eighty
years ago!' he whispered. 'What are you saying?

375
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:13,540
Were she and her brother... But I saw them!'

376
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:22,660
'Yes, that's right,' the guard said. 'You
saw them, but they're not alive. They're ghosts.

377
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:30,359
They often come on the night train at this
time in September. I never see them, but somebody

378
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:38,210
saw them last year. A man and his wife. They
were very unhappy about it. But what can I

379
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:44,390
do? I can't stop Elena and Carl coming on
the train.'

380
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:51,250
The guard looked at Mr Harris's white face.
'You need a drink,' he said. 'Come and have

381
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,130
a vodka with me.'

382
00:45:54,130 --> 00:46:01,190
Mr Harris didn't usually drink vodka, but
he felt afraid. When he closed his eyes, he

383
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:08,099
could see again Elena's long knife and could
hear her terrible cry. So he went with the

384
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,309
guard to the back of the train.

385
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:18,300
After the vodka, Mr Harris felt better. He
didn't want to sleep, and the guard was happy

386
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:25,000
to talk. So Mr Harris stayed with the guard
and didn't go back to his carriage.

387
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:33,940
'Yes,' the guard said, 'it's a famous story.
I don't remember it all. It happened a long

388
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:43,579
time ago, of course. Elena's father was a
famous man here in Finland. He was very rich

389
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:50,340
once, but he had three or four wives and about
eight children. And he liked the good things

390
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:58,390
of life. So there wasn't much money for the
children. Carl, the oldest son, was a bad

391
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:06,680
man, people say. He wanted an easy life, and
money in his hand all the time.'

392
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:13,819
The train hurried on to Oulu through the black
night, and the guard drank some more vodka.

393
00:47:13,819 --> 00:47:21,369
'Now, Elena,' he said. 'She didn't have an
easy life with those three difficult men - her

394
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:29,980
father, her brother, her husband. One year
she visited her mother's family in Italy,

395
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:38,160
and there she met her husband, di Saronelli.
He was rich, but he wasn't a kind man. They

396
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:45,119
came back to Finland, and Carl often visited
their house. He wanted money from his sister's

397
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:53,120
rich husband. Elena loved her brother, and
gave him some money. But di Saronelli didn't

398
00:47:53,120 --> 00:48:02,600
like Carl and was angry with Elena. He stopped
giving her money, and after that... well,

399
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,839
you know the story now.'

400
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:13,160
'Yes,' Mr Harris said. 'Poor, unhappy Elena.'

401
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:19,680
Mr Harris stayed with his friends in Oulu
for two weeks. They were quiet weeks, and

402
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:28,140
Mr Harris had a good holiday. But he took
the bus back to Helsinki. The bus was slow,

403
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:34,130
and there were a lot of people on it, but
Mr Harris was very happy. He didn't want to

404
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:37,099
take the night train across Finland again.
