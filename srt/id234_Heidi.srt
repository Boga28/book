CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,480
A Mountain Home

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,920
It was a hot morning in June in the Alps. 
Heidi walked behind her aunt named Dete.  

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,040
They were walking through the 
village and up the mountain.  

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,420
Heidi was very hot because she 
was wearing all her clothes.  

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,700
She had to carry them to her new 
home. She was only six years old.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:32,640
As Heidi and her aunt hurried out of 
the village, a villager stopped to talk.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,420
"Dete, is this the orphan your sister left 
when she died? Where are you taking her?"

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,060
"Yes, this is Heidi. I'm taking 
her to live with her grandfather.  

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,980
I'm starting a job in the city. So 
I can't take care of her any more."

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,300
"Poor Heidi," said the villager. "No one 
else will talk to that grumpy old man.

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,500
While Dete was talking with the villager, 
Heidi met a boy named Peter. He was the  

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,660
village goat herder. Every morning, Peter 
came to the village to get the goats.

14
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,340
He was going to take them up the mountain. Heidi 
followed him up the mountain. She couldn't keep  

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,400
up with him because of her heavy clothes. So 
she took off all of them except her underwear.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,780
Then she danced behind Peter. He thought she 
was funny. The two children began laughing.

17
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,360
Dete caught up with them.

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,440
"Where are your clothes?" she asked.

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,680
"I don't need them!" Heidi said.

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,500
"I want to run free like the goats!"

21
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,940
Aunt Dete scolded Heidi and sent Peter to get 
her clothes. They walked for another hour.

22
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:57,180
Near the mountaintop was Grandfather's hut. 
The old man was sitting in front of the house.

23
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,020
Heidi ran up to him and held out her hand.

24
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,260
"Hello, Grandfather," she said. He 
held her hand and stared at her.

25
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,020
"Good morning, Uncle," said Dete. 
Heidi must stay with you now."  

26
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,580
She explained why she couldn't 
take care of the child any more.

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,040
The old man was angry. "You 
can just get out of here!"  

28
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,060
he yelled at Dete. Aunt Dete said 
goodbye to Heidi very quickly and left.

29
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,580
Heidi looked around her new home.

30
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,240
"Where can I sleep?" asked Heidi.

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,560
"Anywhere you want," answered Grandfather.

32
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,560
Heidi saw a ladder behind the bed. 
She climbed the ladder up to the loft.  

33
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,620
The loft was filled with fresh hay.

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,000
''I'll sleep up here," said Heidi happily.

35
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,180
Heidi followed Grandfather everywhere. She 
watched as he made a new chair for her.  

36
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,180
When the sun was setting, Heidi heard a whistle.  

37
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,380
It was Peter bringing the goats home. Grandfather  

38
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,740
had two goats. Their names were Daisy 
and Dusky. Heidi liked them at once.

39
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,660
The next morning, Peter's whistle woke Heidi. 
She got ready to go with Peter. She was excited.  

40
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,240
The mountain was very beautiful. 
Heidi picked flowers and chased  

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,480
the goats. Peter told her all of the goats' names.

42
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,460
Heidi was sad when she heard that 
a little goat had lost its mother.  

43
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,300
She promised to take special care of that goat.

44
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,060
By now, the sun was setting.

45
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,080
It spread a golden glow across 
the tops of the mountains.

46
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,000
"Peter!" cried Heidi. "The mountains are on fire!"

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:04,560
"Don't worry," replied Peter. "That happens 
every day. It means it's time to go home."

48
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,880
Heidi went up the mountain with 
Peter every day during the summer.

49
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,720
She grew to be healthy and strong. She was 
as free as a bird. But when the fall came,  

50
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,320
Grandfather made her stay at home. He was afraid 
the strong winds would blow her off the mountain.  

51
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,860
She spent the days helping him make cheese.

52
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,460
Then came the winter and lots of snow.

53
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,980
Peter went to school in the winter.

54
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,700
One day, he came to the hut. He told Heidi 
that his grandmother would like to meet her.  

55
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,860
She wanted to go.

56
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,100
But Grandfather said the snow was too deep.

57
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,380
A few days later, the snow 
finally stopped. The sun came out,  

58
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,040
and Grandfather said she could go out.

59
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,080
He put Heidi on his sled. The sled 
raced down the mountain very fast.  

60
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,480
Grandfather stopped the sled 
in front of Peter's small hut.

61
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,740
Heidi met an old woman that was sewing.

62
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,220
"Hello, Grannie," said Heidi.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,680
Grannie smiled and felt Heidi's 
hand. Grannie was blind.

64
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,420
"Why can't you see?" asked Heidi.

65
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:30,480
"I can't see," Grannie said 
kindly, "but I can hear."

66
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Heidi spent the rest of the winter with Grannie.  

67
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,680
Sometimes Grandfather came and fixed 
the windows and chairs in Grannie's hut.

68
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,320
CHAPTER TWO

69
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,720
Heidi Goes to Frankfurt

70
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,220
It was near the end of Heidi's 
second happy winter with Grandfather.

71
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,060
One day, the village pastor came to the hut.  

72
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,040
He was angry at Grandfather 
because Heidi wasn't in school.

73
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,900
"Heidi doesn't need school," argued Grandfather.  

74
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,260
"She'll grow up here with the goats and the 
birds. They won't teach her any bad ideas!"

75
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,200
"She must learn to read and 
write!" the pastor argued back.

76
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,900
But he couldn't change Grandfather's mind.

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,620
The next day, Aunt Dete came to the hut.

78
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,580
"I have a wonderful opportunity for 
Heidi," she said. "Heidi is going  

79
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,460
to live with a wealthy family in Frankfurt. 
She'll be a companion to their little girl."

80
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:43,320
"Heidi is happy here!" Grandfather said 
rudely. "She doesn't need to go to Frankfurt!"

81
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,020
Aunt Dete said, "This is a chance for 
Heidi to go to school and church."

82
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,100
"Fine!" yelled Grandfather. "Then 
take her, and don't ever come back!"

83
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,720
Heidi didn't want to leave Grandfather 
to go to Frankfurt. But Aunt Dete lied  

84
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,300
to her that they would be back in a day or two.

85
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,740
"You can even bring fresh bread for Grannie,"  

86
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:18,360
said Aunt Dete. This idea pleased Heidi. 
Grannie had trouble eating black, hard bread.

87
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,220
They left so quickly that Heidi 
couldn't even say goodbye to Peter.

88
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:33,240
Dete took Heidi to a large house in Frankfurt. A 
rich man named Mr Sesemann owned the house. His  

89
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,880
daughter Klara had to stay in a wheelchair. 
Her mother had died a long time ago.  

90
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,240
Now Ms Rottenmeier was looking 
after her. Ms Rottenmeier took  

91
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,020
a look at Heidi. She did not 
like her old clothes and hat.

92
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,380
She didn't even like Heidi's name.

93
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,060
"Is 'Heidi' a real name?" Ms Rottenmeier asked.

94
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,980
"Her mother named her 
Adelheid," Aunt Dete explained.

95
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,140
"Then we shall call her 
Adelheid," said Ms Rottenmeier.

96
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,280
Later, when Ms Rottenmeier was away, Klara 
said, "I'll call you Heidi if you want."

97
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,820
"It doesn't matter," said Heidi. "I'll be 
going home tomorrow with some fresh bread."

98
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,460
"No," said Klara. "You came 
here to keep me company."

99
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,640
At the dinner table, Heidi was happy 
to find fresh bread on her plate.  

100
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,480
She put it in her pocket. A servant, 
Sebastian, brought a dish of food for Heidi.  

101
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,520
She didn't know what to do with it. 
She had never eaten this way before.

102
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,420
Then Ms Rottenmeier told Heidi how she 
should behave at the table for a long time.

103
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,080
But while she was talking, Heidi fell asleep.

104
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,040
When Heidi awoke, she didn't know where she was.  

105
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,840
She remembered that she was 
in Frankfurt. She was afraid.

106
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,300
A few days later, Heidi went for 
a walk while Klara was resting.  

107
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,860
Sebastian told her to look at the 
whole city from the church tower.

108
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,440
When she climbed up to the top of the 
tower, all she could see was buildings.  

109
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,800
There were no mountains and trees. The church 
keeper could see that she was disappointed.

110
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,560
So he showed her a basket of kittens.

111
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:35,160
"You can have them," he said. 
"I'll deliver them to your house."

112
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,360
"Oh yes," said Heidi. "But 
can I have two of them now?"

113
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,280
The keeper gave Heidi two kittens.

114
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,480
When she got home, everyone was waiting 
for her. Ms Rottenmeier was angry.

115
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,620
"Who said you could leave the house?" she asked.

116
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:07,140
"Meow," a sound came from Heidi's pocket. Ms 
Rottenmeier screamed. She was afraid of cats.

117
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,620
The next morning, there was a knock at the 
door. Sebastian came back with a big basket.  

118
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:21,420
Klara opened it, and kittens ran everywhere. 
One kitten climbed up Ms Rottenmeier's skirt.

119
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,060
"Sebastian!" she screamed. "Get 
rid of these little monsters!"

120
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,700
That evening, Ms Rottenmeier 
decided to punish Heidi.  

121
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,200
She said, "I'm going to lock 
you in the cold basement."

122
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:44,880
But Klara said, "Please, wait until 
my father gets home. Let him decide  

123
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,660
what to do."

124
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,180
Ms Rottenmeier agreed.

125
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:56,220
For the next few days, Heidi didn't get into 
any trouble. But she was becoming very homesick.

126
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,960
CHAPTER THREE

127
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,760
Homesick

128
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:07,800
Mr Sesemann came home from his business trip 
with many gifts. He was happy to see Klara.  

129
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,100
He was also happy to meet Heidi. He could 
see that Heidi and Klara liked each other.

130
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,800
But Ms Rottenmeier said terrible 
things about Heidi to Klara's father.

131
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,960
"I think that little girl is crazy," she said. 
"You should see the trouble she's caused here."

132
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,100
Mr Sesemann asked Klara about Heidi.

133
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,020
"What happened while I was away?"

134
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,200
Klara told him about the kittens and 
other things. Mr Sesemann laughed.

135
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,780
He went to Ms Rottenmeier and said,

136
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,020
"Heidi will stay. She is good for Klara."

137
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,780
A few days later, Mr  

138
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,680
Sesemann left on another business travel. But 
his mother, Grandmamma Sesemann, came to visit.  

139
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,980
Her face seemed very kind to Heidi. 
Heidi liked Grandmamma very much.

140
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,000
One day, Grandmamma showed Heidi a book. 
She wanted to help Heidi with her reading.

141
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,320
In the book there was a picture 
of a boy with goats on a mountain.  

142
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:22,500
The picture reminded Heidi of Peter, so she began 
to cry. She was very homesick. Grandmamma told  

143
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:29,580
Heidi she could have the book when she learned to 
read. From then on, Heidi tried very hard to read.

144
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,440
That night, she prayed to God 
to help her read and go home.

145
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:42,300
After a week, Grandmamma heard Heidi reading to 
Klara. She gladly gave Heidi the picture book.  

146
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,780
It was time for Grandmamma to leave the house.

147
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,580
After she left, something strange 
started happening at night.  

148
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,780
Every morning, the front door was wide open. 
Sebastian locked the door tight every evening.  

149
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,460
But in the morning, it was open. It was a mystery.

150
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,800
One night, Sebastian and another 
servant stayed up to watch the door.  

151
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Then the wind blew the candle out. The house 
was totally dark, and the door was open.  

152
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,160
Sebastian saw a small person 
in white run up the stairs.

153
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,920
He thought it was a ghost. He told 
everyone there was a ghost in the house.

154
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:34,860
Two days later, Mr Sesemann came home. He and his 
friend, Dr. Classen, stayed up to watch the door.

155
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,160
Late that night, they heard the door opening. 
There was a small person in white clothes.  

156
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,900
It was Heidi.

157
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,860
"What are you doing? asked Mr Sesemann.

158
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
Heidi looked confused.

159
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,980
''I don't know," she answered. "Every 
night I dream I'm back with Grandfather."

160
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,600
"She's been sleepwalking," said Dr. Classen.  

161
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,820
"She must be very homesick. The 
only cure is to send her home."

162
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:14,100
The next day, Mr Sesemann prepared to send Heidi 
home. Klara was very upset when she learned Heidi  

163
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,800
was leaving. But her father promised her she 
could visit Heidi with Grandmamma very soon.

164
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,960
CHAPTER FOUR

165
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,640
Heidi Returns

166
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:30,300
Sebastian and Heidi traveled to her village. All 
of the villagers were surprised that Heidi came  

167
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,880
back to live with her grandfather. The first 
place Heidi ran to was Peter and Grannie's  

168
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:42,480
hut. Heidi cried and sat on Grannie's lap. 
She gave Grannie a basket of fresh bread.

169
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,140
Then she climbed the mountain 
to see her grandfather.  

170
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,120
He was sitting outside the hut, just 
like the first time she saw him.

171
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,240
"Grandfather!" Heidi cried.

172
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,260
She threw her arms around him. Grandfather 
cried for the first time in many years.

173
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,900
"So you've come back," he said.

174
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,860
That night, Heidi slept in 
her old bed in the loft.  

175
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,060
It was the best night of sleep 
she'd had in a long time.

176
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,300
The next day, Grandfather woke Heidi.

177
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,800
"Put your best clothes on," he 
said. "We're going to church."

178
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,660
They went to church in the village. 
Grandfather spoke to the pastor.

179
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,940
"I've decided to move to the village for 
the winter. Heidi will go to school."

180
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,880
The villagers were surprised to see Grandfather 
and the pastor talking like friends.

181
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,960
On the way home, Grandfather told Heidi,  

182
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:47,100
"I never thought I would be this happy again. 
It was a good day when God sent you to me.'

183
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:53,640
That fall, Peter often asked Heidi to herd 
the goats with him. But she told him she was  

184
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,940
too busy. She was cleaning the hut. She was also 
waiting for her friends from Frankfurt to visit.

185
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,320
One day, she looked down the mountain and saw  

186
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,900
somebody coming. It was Dr. Classen. 
Grandfather and Heidi greeted him.

187
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,880
"Where are Grandmamma and Klara?" Heidi asked.

188
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,280
"I'm alone," he said.  

189
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,520
"Klara has been sick. She can't travel until 
springtime, when the weather is warmer."

190
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,840
Heidi was sad, but she was 
glad to see Dr. Classen.

191
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,440
Grandfather gave Dr. Classen a mug of 
fresh goat's milk and some golden cheese.

192
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,360
"This will be a good place for 
Klara to get well," said the doctor.

193
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:46,380
That winter, Heidi and Grandfather moved down to 
the village. Grandfather rented a small hut there.

194
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,000
Heidi missed the mountains. But 
she was very happy to go to school.  

195
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,280
She studied her lessons very hard. 
But Peter rarely went to school.

196
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,620
One day, Heidi asked him, "Why 
weren't you at school again today?"

197
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,080
"I couldn't stop the sled," lied 
Peter. "It went straight through  

198
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,640
the village. I couldn't get off! Then 
it was too late to go to school!"

199
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:19,440
"If you do that again," said Grandfather, 
"you're going to get in big trouble with me!"

200
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,060
When Heidi and Peter came to 
visit Grannie, she was very sick.

201
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:31,260
Grannie couldn't get out of bed. Heidi read 
to her to cheer her up. She thought Peter  

202
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,420
should learn to read. Then he could read 
to Grannie, and maybe she would get well.

203
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,800
The next day at school, Heidi said to Peter,  

204
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,480
"You must learn to read. So 
then you can read to Grannie."

205
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,540
"I can't do it," Peter replied.

206
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,800
"I'm going to teach you," said Heidi.

207
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:59,580
Reading was very difficult for Peter. But Heidi 
made him learn the ABC's with a book from Klara.

208
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,880
Then he began to read a few words. A few 
weeks later, he could read to Grannie.

209
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,940
The whole village heard that Heidi got 
Peter to read. Everyone was very impressed.

210
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,040
CHAPTER FIVE

211
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,020
The Mountain Miracle

212
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,400
When spring came, the 
mountains turned green again.

213
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,780
Then Grandfather and Heidi moved 
back up to their hut on the mountain.  

214
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,340
One day, Peter brought Heidi 
a letter. It was from Klara.

215
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,700
"Klara and Grandmamma will be 
here in six weeks!" cried Heidi.  

216
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,460
She was very excited. But Peter 
was not. He was angry and jealous.

217
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,480
One morning in June, Heidi saw them 
coming up. One man was pushing Klara  

218
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,900
in her wheelchair. Another man carried their 
things. Grandmamma rode behind them on a horse.

219
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,900
Klara and Grandmamma were amazed at 
the beauty of Heidi's mountain home.

220
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,740
"Oh, Heidi," cried Klara. "If only I 
could run over the hills with you!"

221
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,840
"Don't worry," said Heidi. 
"I'll push you everywhere."

222
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,320
Then Grandfather served everyone big 
mugs of goat's milk and toasted cheese.  

223
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,320
They ate happily outside in 
the gentle breeze and sunshine.

224
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,800
When Klara saw Heidi's bed 
in the hayloft, she said,  

225
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,600
"It must be wonderful to look at 
the stars while you go to sleep."

226
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,300
Grandfather asked Grandmamma,  

227
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,280
"Why don't you let Klara stay here 
with us while you stay in the village?"

228
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,260
Grandmamma agreed.

229
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,540
"I think it will be very good 
for Klara's health to stay here."

230
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,520
As the days passed, Grandfather 
grew to like Klara very much.

231
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,360
He told Peter to feed the goats the best grass.  

232
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,260
They made extra-good milk 
that would make Klara strong.

233
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,780
While Klara stayed with them for two 
weeks, Grandfather helped her stand.  

234
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:14,400
Standing made her legs and feet hurt very much. 
But each day, she tried to stand a little longer.

235
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,200
Heidi begged Grandfather to carry 
Klara up to the top of the mountain.  

236
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,860
That was the place where 
the was the most beautiful.

237
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,800
But Grandfather said he would do that 
only if Klara could stand on her own.

238
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,560
Heidi was excited and told 
Peter. But this made Peter angry.

239
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,140
He wanted Klara to go away.

240
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:44,400
The next morning, Peter went up to the hut. 
He saw the empty wheelchair outside. He kicked  

241
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,320
the wheelchair with anger. The wheelchair 
went rolling down the side of the mountain.

242
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,720
Peter was so afraid. He ran 
away without taking the goats.

243
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,360
Grandfather and Heidi came outside 
and found out the wheelchair was  

244
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,180
gone. They looked everywhere for the wheelchair.  

245
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,920
Grandfather saw it down below the mountain. 
The wheelchair was in pieces. It was destroyed.

246
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,980
"It must have been the wind," 
said Heidi. Klara began to cry.

247
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,220
"Now I'll never be able to go up the mountain."

248
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:27,840
"That's okay," said Grandfather. "I'll 
carry you up. By the way, where is Peter?"

249
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,470
Grandfather picked up Klara, 
and they walked up the mountain.

250
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:33,900
The goats followed them.

251
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,300
When Grandfather saw Peter, he 
scolded him for forgetting the goats.

252
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,500
"Did you see Klara's 
wheelchair?" asked Grandfather.

253
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,060
Peter just shook his head to say, "No."

254
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,800
Grandfather left the children on top 
of the mountain and went back home.

255
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,200
After lunch, Heidi wanted to take Klara 
higher to see the prettiest flowers.

256
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,340
"Peter and I can carry you," Heidi said.

257
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,160
They pulled Klara to her feet. But 
suddenly, she began to take a step.

258
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,180
"I'm walking!" she shouted.

259
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,740
When Grandfather came to get them 
later, he was happy to see Klara walk.

260
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:23,760
Klara practiced walking for the next week. 
When Grandmamma came up the mountain,  

261
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,220
Klara surprised her. She cried with 
joy when she saw Klara walking.

262
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:37,980
"Thank you so much!" she said to Grandfather. 
"Your kindness and care have done this for her."

263
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,740
"And God's sun and the mountain 
air," Grandfather replied.

264
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,180
Then Grandmamma decided to send 
a letter to Klara's father.

265
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,040
She wanted him to come early 
and join them for the surprise.

266
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,360
Mr Sesemann had almost arrived at the hut. He 
expected to meet Klara and Heidi in a moment.  

267
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,080
Klara was waiting at the 
hut with a surprise for him.

268
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,840
They saw him getting close to the hut. 
Then Klara stood up and walked to him.  

269
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,240
Mr Sesemann was surprised 
and cried, "It's a miracle!"

270
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,280
Mr Sesemann thanked Grandfather 
and Heidi for helping Klara.

271
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,760
Grandmamma saw Peter hiding behind the hut.

272
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,800
"Young man," she said, "why 
are you so afraid of us?"

273
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:36,480
"I think Peter was the wind that blew Klara's 
wheelchair down the mountain," said Grandfather.

274
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,840
Grandmamma took Peter aside.

275
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:46,440
"What you did was very bad. But 
I understand how you feel," she  

276
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,440
said. "I hope you will always 
remember us." Peter became happy.

277
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:59,220
Later, Mr Sesemann asked Grandfather if 
there was any way he could repay him.

278
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,740
Grandfather thought for a while.

279
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,980
Then he said, "Will you promise 
to take care of Heidi when I die?"

280
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:15,278
Mr Sesemann promised he would, 
and the men shook hands.

281
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:17,160
It was time for the Sesemanns 
to leave. Klara was sad.

282
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,000
But Heidi said to her, "Don't worry. Soon it will  

283
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,600
be summer again. Then you 
can come back and see us."

284
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,220
Heidi stood on the mountain 
and watched her friends leave.

285
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,460
She waved until she couldn't see them any more.

286
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,840
Shortly after, Dr. Classen 
came to live in the village.  

287
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,320
He bought a hut and shared it with Grandfather 
and Heidi in the winter. He told Grandfather  

288
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,960
that he thought of Heidi as his own child. 
He promised to always take care of her.

289
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:55,500
Heidi spent another happy winter in the village. 
All around were people who cared for her.
