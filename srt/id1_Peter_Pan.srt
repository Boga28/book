CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,119
The Nursery

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:12,579
Wendy, John and Michael Darling live in a lovely house in London.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,059
They have got a big, sunny nursery.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,939
There are colourful pictures and a big clock on the wall.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,000
There are toys here and there.

7
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:27,319
The Darlings are a happy family.

8
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:34,159
Mr Darling and Mrs Darling love their children very much.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:43,139
Wendy is the first child, John is the second and Michael is the third.

10
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:50,000
The children's nanny is called Nana and she is a big Newfoundland dog!

11
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:55,579
Her kennel is in the nursery and she is a wonderful nanny.

12
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,759
She loves the children and the children love her.

13
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,919
One evening Mr and Mrs Darling want to go to a dinner party.

14
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:08,439
They have their best clothes on.

15
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:14,599
"Nana, it's time to put the children to bed," says Mrs Darling.

16
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:16,839
Nana goes to the bathroom.

17
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,139
She turns on the hot water for Michael's bath.

18
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:27,119
She puts her paw in the water to check the temperature.

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,119
It's perfect!

20
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,839
"I don't want to have a bath!" says little Michael.

21
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:38,859
But Nana is a firm nanny and Michael has his bath.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,619
Then Nana gives the children their pyjamas.

23
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,899
Now they are ready for bed.

24
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:50,179
Mrs Darling comes into the nursery and smiles.

25
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:56,839
"Good work, Nana! I see the children are ready for bed." Nana wags her big tail.

26
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,299
Suddenly there is a noise.

27
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,698
Mrs Darling sees a young boy outside the nursery window.

28
00:02:05,598 --> 00:02:07,238
She is very surprised.

29
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,218
Nana barks and shuts the window quickly.

30
00:02:15,038 --> 00:02:17,818
The boy's shadow falls on the floor.

31
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,618
The young boy flies away.

32
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:24,258
"Who's there?" asks Mrs Darling.

33
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:29,818
She opens the window and looks outside, but she sees nothing.

34
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:39,458
Then she sees the boy's shadow on the floor and says, "Poor boy, this is his shadow. Let's put it in the drawer."

35
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:42,418
The children are in bed.

36
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:45,898
Mr Darling takes Nana to the garden.

37
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,678
Then he goes to the sitting room and waits for Mrs Darling.

38
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:59,578
Mrs Darling sings to the children and kisses them.

39
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,958
She is a perfect mother.

40
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,398
Soon the three children are sleeping.

41
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:10,758
Mr and Mrs Darling go to their bedroom.

42
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,058
They put on their coats and go to the dinner party.

43
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:20,438
CHAPTER TWO

44
00:03:21,978 --> 00:03:23,058
The Shadow

45
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:28,338
The children are sleeping and dreaming.

46
00:03:28,398 --> 00:03:30,918
Suddenly the window opens.

47
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:39,598
A small ball of light enters the nursery and flies around.

48
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:43,118
It is a lovely fairy called Tinker Bell.

49
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,778
She is looking for something.

50
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:56,018
After a moment a young boy enters the nursery and says, "Tink, where are you? Please find my shadow."

51
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,717
Tinker Bell finds his shadow in the drawer and gives it to him.

52
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:05,997
"Now I can stick the shadow to my feet with some soap," he thinks.

53
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:10,117
He tries and tries again, but he can't.

54
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:13,977
He is very confused and starts crying.

55
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:20,217
Wendy wakes up and sees the boy but she is not afraid.

56
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,117
His clothes are made of leaves.

57
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:28,237
"Little boy, why are you crying?" Wendy asks.

58
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:33,278
The boy takes off his cap and asks, "What's your name?"

59
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,397
"Wendy Moira Angela Darling. What's yours?"

60
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:39,938
"Peter Pan."

61
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:41,437
"Is that all?"

62
00:04:42,177 --> 00:04:44,117
"Yes!" says Peter.

63
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:48,837
Then he thinks, "My name is very, very short."

64
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:54,778
Wendy looks at his shadow and asks, "Can I help you with your shadow?"

65
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:57,617
"Yes, please!" says Peter.

66
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:02,598
Wendy gets her sewing basket and sews on Peter's shadow.

67
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:09,037
After a few minutes she says, "Finished! Now you have your shadow again."

68
00:05:09,717 --> 00:05:13,017
Peter looks at the floor and sees his shadow.

69
00:05:16,498 --> 00:05:19,918
He is very happy and dances around the room.

70
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:30,257
"Oh, Wendy, you are wonderful!" says Peter.

71
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,957
"Do you really think so?" asks Wendy.

72
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:36,357
"Yes," says Peter.

73
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:40,837
Wendy smiles and gives Peter a kiss on the cheek.

74
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:43,797
"Oh!" says Peter.

75
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:44,797
"How nice!"

76
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:48,557
"How old are you, Peter?" asks Wendy.

77
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:57,357
"I don't know, but I am young. I don't want to grow up. I always want to be a boy and have fun."

78
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:00,756
Peter looks around the room for his fairy.

79
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:09,016
He hears a noise and looks in a drawer.

80
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,356
Tinker Bell flies out.

81
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:16,856
Wendy is delighted to see a fairy, but Tinker Bell is afraid.

82
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:19,477
She hides behind the big clock.

83
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,916
"Where do you live, Peter?" asks Wendy.

84
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:31,836
"I live in Neverland with the Lost Boys," says Peter.

85
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:37,596
"Neverland? The Lost Boys? Who are they?" asks Wendy.

86
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:59,897
"The Lost Boys haven't got a mother or father. They are alone in the world and they live in Neverland. I am their Captain. In Neverland we fight the pirates. We also swim in the lagoon with the beautiful mermaids. Fairies live in the trees in the forest. The fairies are my friends," says Peter.

87
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:03,396
"Oh, what fun!" says Wendy.

88
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:11,236
"I must go back now. I must tell the Lost Boys a story. They love stories," says Peter.

89
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:15,396
"Don't go away! I know a lot of stories," says Wendy.

90
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:24,856
"Then come with me, Wendy. You can tell us stories. We all want a mother. Please come," says Peter.

91
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:27,396
"But I can't fly," says Wendy.

92
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:30,877
"I can teach you to fly," says Peter.

93
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:34,396
"Can you teach John and Michael to fly too?"

94
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:37,196
"Yes, of course," says Peter.

95
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:46,296
"John! Michael! Wake up! This is Peter Pan. He's from Neverland. It's a beautiful place," says Wendy.

96
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:50,316
John and Michael are very surprised.

97
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:56,456
"We can go there with him. But first we must learn to fly," Wendy says.

98
00:07:57,917 --> 00:08:01,775
Wendy, John and Michael are very excited.

99
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:06,415
They try to fly but fall on the beds and on the floor.

100
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:09,076
"No, no," says Peter.

101
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:14,736
"Here is some fairy dust." He puts some fairy dust on their shoulders.

102
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:18,175
"Now try again," says Peter.

103
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:22,175
"Look, I can fly!" says Wendy.

104
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,935
"I can too," says John.

105
00:08:25,576 --> 00:08:28,175
"Me too," says little Michael.

106
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:32,516
"Tink, show us the way to Neverland," says Peter.

107
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:37,575
They follow Tinker Bell and fly out of the nursery window.

108
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:42,135
In the garden Nana looks at the sky and barks.

109
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,095
Mr and Mrs Darling return from the dinner party.

110
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:52,655
They go into the nursery, but it is empty!

111
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:58,215
CHAPTER THREE

112
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:00,295
The Neverland

113
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:11,975
Wendy, John and Michael fly over cities, towns, mountains, forests and seas.

114
00:09:12,816 --> 00:09:16,215
Finally they see an island in the sea below them.

115
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,115
"Look, that's Neverland," says Peter.

116
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:23,216
"Neverland!" say the children.

117
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:31,275
In Neverland the Lost Boys live in the forest in a secret underground home.

118
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:41,755
There are six Lost Boys: Slightly Soiled, Tootles, Nibs, Curly and the Twins.

119
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:44,075
They are waiting for Peter.

120
00:09:45,555 --> 00:09:48,635
Suddenly they hear the voices of the pirates.

121
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,255
Nibs is very brave.

122
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:57,275
He goes out, hides behind a tree and looks around him.

123
00:09:58,415 --> 00:10:00,674
He sees the horrible pirates.

124
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,074
They are walking in the forest.

125
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:05,954
They are big and ugly.

126
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:09,954
Their pirate ship is the Jolly Roger.

127
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:58,854
The pirates" captain is James Hook. He is a cruel pirate and a very bad man. He's got black eyes, black hair and a black beard. He hates Peter Pan. He's only got one arm. The other is a hook! In the past Peter Pan cut off Captain Hook's right arm during a fight. A crocodile ate the arm. Now the crocodile follows Captain Hook everywhere because he wants to eat him. The crocodile has an alarm clock in its stomach! Captain Hook can always hear it.

128
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:02,615
"I know the Lost Boys live in this forest.

129
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:06,554
We must find them and Peter Pan!" says Captain Hook.

130
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:08,794
"Tick, tock, tick, tock!"

131
00:11:09,154 --> 00:11:11,734
Captain Hook hears the alarm clock.

132
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:16,355
"Oh, no, the crocodile is coming to eat me!" says Captain Hook.

133
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:20,054
He runs away and the pirates follow him.

134
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:24,914
Soon some Indians arrive in the forest.

135
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:28,214
They are looking for the pirates.

136
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:30,054
The pirates are their enemy.

137
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:33,034
Tiger Lily is their leader.

138
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:37,074
She is the beautiful daughter of the Indian chief.

139
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:40,714
She loves Peter Pan.

140
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:43,194
Tinker Bell and Wendy love him too.

141
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:51,214
The Indians go away and the Lost Boys return to play in the forest.

142
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:59,454
Then Nibs looks at the sky and says, "Look, there is a lovely white bird in the sky."

143
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:04,094
"Is it really a bird?" the Lost Boys ask.

144
00:12:05,154 --> 00:12:16,033
Tinker Bell says, "Yes, yes, it's a bird. It's a Wendy bird. You must shoot it!" Sometimes Tink is a bad fairy.

145
00:12:16,713 --> 00:12:20,213
She knows it is Wendy, but she doesn't like her.

146
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:26,273
Nibs takes his bow and arrow and shoots Wendy.

147
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:29,613
Poor Wendy falls to the ground.

148
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:36,553
The Lost Boys see Wendy and say, "She's not a bird! She's a lovely girl."

149
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:43,173
Peter flies down with John and Michael and asks, "Where is Wendy?"

150
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:46,393
Tootles says, "Here she is."

151
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:57,594
Peter goes over to her and asks, "Wendy, are you all right?" Wendy slowly opens her eyes and smiles.

152
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:01,734
"Yes, but I'm very tired," she says.

153
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,873
The Lost Boys are sorry.

154
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:07,893
They decide to build her a little house.

155
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:14,993
When the house is ready Wendy says, "What a lovely little house! Thank you."

156
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:22,513
"Can you be our mother now? Can you tell us bedtime stories before we go to bed?" asks Nibs.

157
00:13:23,414 --> 00:13:25,373
"Of course," says Wendy.

158
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,533
"Come in and I can tell you the story of Cinderella."

159
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:34,873
They enter, sit down and listen to Wendy's story.

160
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:37,433
It is a wonderful story.

161
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:41,073
Peter Pan is outside the house with his sword.

162
00:13:41,914 --> 00:13:49,833
He wants to protect Wendy and the Lost Boys.

163
00:13:49,893 --> 00:13:50,873
CHAPTER FOUR

164
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:55,414
The Mermaid's Lagoon

165
00:13:57,533 --> 00:14:07,092
One summer evening Peter, Wendy, John, Michael and the Lost Boys go to the Mermaid's Lagoon.

166
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:12,572
Beautiful mermaids live here and they are Peter's friends.

167
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,193
They swim and play in the blue lagoon.

168
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:21,752
Then they sit on Marooner's Rock to comb their long hair.

169
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,652
They sit in the sun and laugh.

170
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:35,533
The children like the mermaids and John says, "I want to catch one!" He tries, but the mermaid jumps into the water.

171
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:42,912
Peter says, "It is very difficult to catch a mermaid."

172
00:14:43,472 --> 00:14:47,372
Suddenly someone says, "Look, the pirates are coming!"

173
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:51,552
A small boat with two pirates is coming to the lagoon.

174
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:57,212
John, Michael and the Lost Boys jump off the rock and swim away.

175
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:02,732
But Wendy stays with Peter.

176
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:05,272
They hide behind the rock.

177
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,832
Peter sees Tiger Lily.

178
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:10,772
She is sitting in the small boat.

179
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:14,772
Poor Tiger Lily is a prisoner of the pirates.

180
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:20,472
"Let's leave her on this rock. When the sea rises, she will die!" says Smee.

181
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:22,553
The two pirates laugh.

182
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:28,972
It is already night and it is very dark.

183
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:33,112
Peter wants to save Tiger Lily and thinks of something intelligent.

184
00:15:33,812 --> 00:15:44,152
He imitates Captain Hook's voice and says, "Cut the ropes and let her go! Do as I say, you idiots! Let her go!" The two pirates are amazed.

185
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:47,193
"Can you hear Hook's voice?" asks Smee.

186
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:50,232
"Yes, but what do we do?" asks Starkey.

187
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:54,172
"We must obey him and cut the ropes," says Smee.

188
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:57,092
They cut the ropes and Tiger Lily is free.

189
00:15:57,112 --> 00:16:03,971
She quickly jumps into the water and swims away.

190
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:08,991
Captain Hook sees everything and he is furious.

191
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:14,631
"That horrid Peter Pan! This time I must attack him," he says.

192
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,491
He swims to the rock and fights with Peter.

193
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:21,571
It is a long fight.

194
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:27,331
The Captain hurts Peter with his hook, but Peter fights courageously.

195
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:33,411
At last, Peter wins the fight and Hook swims back to the Jolly Roger.

196
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:37,091
Peter is now alone on the rock with Wendy.

197
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:43,372
"The sea is rising and we are in great danger here. We must leave this rock," says Peter.

198
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:49,151
"Oh, Peter, I am very tired and I cannot swim or fly."

199
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:52,271
He sees a big kite with a long tail.

200
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,471
It is flying slowly over the lagoon.

201
00:16:56,211 --> 00:17:04,191
He takes the tail of the kite and says, "Wendy, hold on to this tail and fly away with the kite." Wendy flies away.

202
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:08,091
"The sea is rising. I must fly away," Peter thinks.

203
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:14,231
When he gets home everyone is happy to see him especially Wendy.

204
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:20,571
CHAPTER FIVE

205
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:22,991
The Underground Home

206
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:28,032
The Underground Home is a secret place.

207
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:30,591
No one knows where it is.

208
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:33,611
It is a happy, warm place.

209
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:37,791
There is only one room with a big fireplace.

210
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:40,971
Tinker Bell has her tiny room too.

211
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:45,352
Wendy is a perfect mother.

212
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:48,191
She cooks and sews for everyone.

213
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:52,511
She also tells beautiful bedtime stories.

214
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:57,850
The Lost Boys are happy because they finally have a mother.

215
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:03,810
John and Michael are happy because there is a new adventure every day.

216
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,471
Peter Pan is a perfect father.

217
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,650
He brings home food and protects the family.

218
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,110
Wendy and Peter play with the children and laugh with them.

219
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,110
But one night something happens.

220
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,710
Wendy tells the children this bedtime story:

221
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:50,930
"In the big city of London there are two parents. They are very sad because they cannot find their three children. Every night they leave the nursery window open. They wait and wait for their children to return. But they don't return. Poor parents! They are very sad without their children."

222
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,370
"Oh, Wendy, this is the story of our parents," says John.

223
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,770
"Yes, it is," says Michael.

224
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:05,710
Peter listens and says, "Sometimes parents forget their children and other children take their place."

225
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,890
Wendy is very surprised.

226
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,970
"Oh, no!" she says!

227
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:16,050
"Perhaps there are other children in our beds! John, Michael we must go home!"

228
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,930
"Do we really have to?" ask John and Michael.

229
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,910
"Yes, we've got to return home."

230
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:31,430
The Lost Boys are sad and say, "Oh, Wendy, please don't leave us!"

231
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,970
"Don't be sad. You can come and live with us in London," says Wendy.

232
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,230
"Oh, how wonderful!" the Lost Boys say.

233
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:47,150
"We can have a real family." They jump up and down with joy.

234
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,710
They dance around the room.

235
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,250
But Peter is not happy.

236
00:19:52,351 --> 00:20:00,609
He is very serious and says, "I'm not coming with you to London. I don't want to grow up. I want to be a boy forever."

237
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:03,369
Everyone says goodbye to Peter.

238
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:08,530
Outside, the pirates are waiting for them!

239
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:13,229
The children come out of the underground home and the pirates capture them.

240
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,869
Then they take them to the Jolly Roger.

241
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:18,370
They don't make any noise.

242
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:20,549
Peter doesn't know where they are.

243
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:25,809
He is sad without Wendy, John, Michael and the Lost Boys.

244
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,829
He sits and thinks.

245
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:32,829
"Tap, tap, tap!" There is someone at the door.

246
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:35,469
"Who is it?" asks Peter.

247
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:40,409
He can hear the sound of little bells and opens the door.

248
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:53,210
Tinker Bell flies in and says, "The pirates have got Wendy, John, Michael and the Lost Boys! They are in danger. Let's help them!"

249
00:20:54,349 --> 00:21:01,809
"I must save them. Come Tink, let's go to the Jolly Roger! This time I must attack Hook!"

250
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,210
CHAPTER SIX

251
00:21:08,229 --> 00:21:09,509
The Jolly Roger

252
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:14,030
There is a yellow moon in the night sky.

253
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,189
The folly Roger is in the bay near Kidd's Creek.

254
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:21,549
The children are on the pirate ship.

255
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:26,269
They are prisoners of Captain Hook and his cruel pirates.

256
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:38,549
Captain Hook looks at them and says, "This time it's Peter Pan or me! You idiots! Peter Pan can't save you now." Hook laughs and then calls Smee.

257
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:40,789
"Smee, get the plank ready!"

258
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:42,949
"Yes sir!" says Smee.

259
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:45,269
"Now listen to me," says Hook.

260
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:47,789
"You must all walk the plank!"

261
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,609
"Walk the plank?" asks John.

262
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:59,568
"Yes! First you walk the plank and then you fall into the sea with the crocodile. It will eat you! Ha, ha!" laughs Hook.

263
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:06,168
"But I can save two of you. I want two young pirates. Who wants to be a pirate?"

264
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:08,688
The Lost Boys look at John.

265
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:22,408
John looks at Michael and says, "The life of a pirate is exciting. I don't want to walk the plank. I don't want to be food for the crocodile. Let's be pirates!" Michael looks at his brother.

266
00:22:23,228 --> 00:22:24,568
Then they look at Wendy.

267
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:27,108
She doesn't like their idea.

268
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:32,208
Captain Hook laughs and moves his hook in front of their faces.

269
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:36,008
"Do you want to be pirates, yes or no?" he asks.

270
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:39,288
John and Michael say, "Never!"

271
00:22:40,168 --> 00:22:44,969
Captain Hook is angry and says, "Then you must walk the plank and die!"

272
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:46,888
Wendy is afraid.

273
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:49,748
She loves her brothers and the Lost Boys.

274
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,248
She has tears in her eyes.

275
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:57,328
The boys stand near the plank and Wendy watches them.

276
00:22:58,228 --> 00:23:01,828
A pirate asks, "Who is the first to walk the plank?"

277
00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:04,848
At that moment there is a loud noise.

278
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:07,008
"Tick! Tock! Tick! Tock!"

279
00:23:07,328 --> 00:23:09,248
Captain Hook's face is white.

280
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:16,788
He says, "The crocodile is here. He wants ME!" He runs to his cabin and hides there.

281
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:22,568
"Who is the first to walk the plank?" asks a pirate.

282
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:25,349
"Come on! Let's go! The crocodile is hungry."

283
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:29,628
Suddenly Peter Pan appears on the pirate ship.

284
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:31,048
Tinker Bell follows him.

285
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:33,388
Wendy and the boys cheer.

286
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,968
They are very happy to see their young hero.

287
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:41,088
Hook and his pirates are furious.

288
00:23:41,748 --> 00:23:46,788
Hook takes his sword and says, "I want to fight you, Pan! Tonight you will die!"

289
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:53,129
Hook fights with his long sword and with his hook.

290
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:55,548
Peter fights courageously.

291
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:58,227
He pushes Hook to the back of the ship.

292
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:00,487
It is a terrible fight.

293
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:05,127
John, Michael and the Lost Boys fight the pirates.

294
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:10,047
After a long fight they throw the pirates into the sea.

295
00:24:13,627 --> 00:24:16,847
Peter and Hook move all around the big ship.

296
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:19,747
Their swords make a loud noise.

297
00:24:20,648 --> 00:24:25,007
Suddenly Peter takes Hook's sword and pushes him into the sea!

298
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:35,647
Hook shouts, "OH, NO!" He falls into the sea and into the mouth of the hungry crocodile.

299
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:41,727
"Oh, Peter, we are proud of you!" says Wendy.

300
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:43,607
She kisses him on the cheek.

301
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:46,347
The boys cheer.

302
00:24:48,847 --> 00:24:58,908
Peter smiles and says, "The Jolly Roger is ours now. Let's go home!"

303
00:24:58,967 --> 00:24:59,987
CHAPTER SEVEN

304
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,527
Home at Last!

305
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:10,087
At the Darling home, Mr and Mrs Darling and Nana are desolate.

306
00:25:11,068 --> 00:25:14,107
They always think about Wendy, John and Michael.

307
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:20,647
They look at the three empty beds and tears come to their eyes.

308
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:26,067
Mr and Mrs Darling never smile or laugh anymore.

309
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:32,287
Mrs Darling sits in the silent nursery and cries.

310
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:41,827
She thinks of her children, their games and their happy voices.

311
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:48,107
Nana tries to comfort her, but nothing can make Mrs Darling happy.

312
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:54,467
One night after several months something incredible happens.

313
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:59,567
Wendy, John and Michael fly in to the nursery.

314
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:03,506
Mrs Darling is sitting near the fireplace.

315
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:06,986
"Mother, Mother we're home!" says Wendy.

316
00:26:08,086 --> 00:26:12,687
Mrs Darling turns around and sees her three dear children.

317
00:26:14,126 --> 00:26:20,746
"Is this true or is it a dream? I can't believe it!" she says.

318
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:25,366
"Oh, Mother, we are home at last," the children say.

319
00:26:26,107 --> 00:26:29,566
Wendy, John and Michael embrace their mother and kiss her.

320
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:42,687
"How wonderful to see you, my dear children! How wonderful to hear your sweet voices. Oh, let me look at you!" She calls Mr Darling.

321
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:46,027
Mr Darling is very happy and surprised.

322
00:26:46,726 --> 00:26:49,546
There is great joy in the Darling nursery tonight.

323
00:26:50,286 --> 00:26:57,786
"Mother," says Wendy, "Peter Pan and the Lost Boys are here too. They are waiting outside."

324
00:26:58,606 --> 00:27:02,707
The six Lost Boys slowly enter the nursery.

325
00:27:03,427 --> 00:27:06,607
They look at Mrs Darling and smile at her.

326
00:27:07,387 --> 00:27:14,027
"Mother, these are the Lost Boys. They haven't got a mother. Can they stay with us?" says Wendy.

327
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:18,286
"What dear little boys!" says Mrs Darling.

328
00:27:18,606 --> 00:27:23,306
"Of course they can stay with us. And where is Peter Pan?"

329
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:42,186
Peter enters the nursery and says, "I am here, but I don't want to stay here. I don't want to go to school and I don't want to grow up! I want to be a young boy forever. I must return to Neverland. I am happy with the Indians and the fairies."

330
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:48,266
Wendy is surprised and says, "But Peter, when will I see you again?"

331
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:57,707
Mrs Darling says, "I have an idea. Wendy, you can visit Peter in Neverland every spring! You can stay there for a week."

00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:02,526
"Can I really go to Neverland every spring, Mother?" asks Wendy.

333
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:07,246
Peter looks at Mrs Darling and asks, "Is that a promise?"

334
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,686
"Of course it is," says Mrs Darling.

335
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:14,187
"Then I want spring to come quickly," says Peter.

336
00:28:14,687 --> 00:28:17,306
"Yes, very quickly," says Wendy.

337
00:28:18,187 --> 00:28:21,906
"Come on, Tink! Let's fly home and wait for spring," says Peter.

338
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:28,166
Peter Pan and Tinker Bell fly out of the nursery window into the night sky.

339
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:29,906
Their destination?

340
00:28:30,887 --> 00:28:31,726
Neverland!
