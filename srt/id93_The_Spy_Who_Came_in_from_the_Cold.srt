CHAPTER ONE
Checkpoint

2
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:10,850
The American gave Alec Leamas another cup
of coffee and said, "Why don't you go back

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,700
home and sleep?

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,369
We can phone you if he comes."

5
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,520
Leamas did not answer.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,119
He just stared through the window of the West
German checkpoint.

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,669
The street near the hut was empty.

8
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:30,090
"You can't wait forever, sir," said the American.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,530
"Maybe he'll come another time."

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,910
"He's coming," said Leamas.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,690
"It's nearly dark now."

12
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,580
Leamas stood next to a policeman who was watching
the East German checkpoint through binoculars.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,910
"He's waiting for the dark," Leamas said.

14
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,820
"I know he is."

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,880
"But he's nine hours late," said the American.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,330
Leamas became angry.

17
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,350
"He's an agent - one of my agents," he said.

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,200
"He doesn't have a timetable.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,619
He's in danger.

20
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,399
He's frightened.

21
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:17,640
Mundt knows that Karl is spying for us, and
Mundt's chasing him.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,189
Karl knows he has one chance to escape - let
him choose the best time."

23
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:30,189
"How did Mundt know about Karl?" asked the
American.

24
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:39,039
"Shut up!" replied Leamas, and then he added
more quietly, "I don't know."

25
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:43,930
A bell rang suddenly inside the hut.

26
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,789
They waited silently.

27
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:53,619
High above the checkpoint, huge lamps came
on, shining their yellow light on everything.

28
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:58,350
The policeman with the binoculars started
to speak in German.

29
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,219
"The car has stopped at the first checkpoint,"
he said.

30
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:08,030
"There is one person in it - a woman.

31
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:14,250
The East German guards are taking her to the
hut to look at her documents.

32
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,060
The document check is completed.

33
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,400
The car is going to the second checkpoint.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,879
"The woman is going inside the hut.

35
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,790
The guards are checking inside the car.

36
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,790
The woman is coming out, and the barrier pole
has been raised.

37
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:40,140
She is driving the car over the bridge, past
the final East German guard and into West

38
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,880
Berlin."

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,260
Leamas went out of the hut into the icy winter
night.

40
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,950
The small crowd of people that was always
near the checkpoint stood silently, lit by

41
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,400
the huge lamps.

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:04,280
The people changed, but the faces did not
they always looked helpless and confused.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,150
The car had passed the hut and stopped further
along the street.

44
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,230
Leamas had recognized the woman.

45
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,680
He walked over to the car and spoke through
the window to her.

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,879
"Where is he?"

47
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:28,590
"They came for him," she replied, "but he
escaped - he took our bicycle.

48
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,990
He has some money and some false documents.

49
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,599
He said that he will come over tonight at
this crossing point."

50
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,459
"Tonight?" said Leamas.

51
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,540
"Are you sure?"

52
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,400
"Yes, he has to," she replied.

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
"All the other agents have been caught by
Mundt."

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:56,049
"All of them - Landser, too - as well as Paul,
Viereck and Salomon?"

55
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:57,349
"Yes."

56
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:01,330
"How do you know?" he asked.

57
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,959
"Karl told me," she replied.

58
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,189
"He trusts me, and he tells me everything."

59
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,499
Leamas did not reply.

60
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:17,250
He was angry with his agent for talking to
this woman about his work for the British

61
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,840
secret service.

62
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,620
He had met her once with Karl, who had brought
her to a bar in West Berlin.

63
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,020
Leamas had been angry that Karl had brought
her to a meeting with him.

64
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,030
"Stupid man," thought Leamas.

65
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:42,930
"Agents are all the same - you train them
to lie, to trust nobody and to protect themselves.

66
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,889
But they don't listen."

67
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:52,150
He pulled a key from his pocket and gave it
to the woman.

68
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,020
"You'll need somewhere to stay," he said.

69
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,669
"Go to Albrecht-Durer Strasse, number 28A.

70
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,720
I'll phone you when he comes."

71
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,720
He went back to the silent hut.

72
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,080
The American was not there.

73
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,830
"He's gone home," said the policeman.

74
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,020
Leamas told the policeman that they were waiting
for a man on a bicycle, and then he went to

75
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,710
the window and waited.

76
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,669
In front of him was the road, and to either
side there was the Wall.

77
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:37,170
It was a dirty, ugly thing built from big
blocks of rough concrete, with barbed wire

78
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,250
on top and in front of it.

79
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,750
"Sir!

80
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,250
Look!"

81
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,520
the policeman suddenly whispered.

82
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,270
"It's a man with a bicycle."

83
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,180
Leamas recognized the man who was pushing
the bicycle.

84
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,520
It was Karl.

85
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,460
"He's done it," thought Leamas.

86
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,229
"He's got through the first checkpoint.

87
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:06,890
There's just the second one now."

88
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:12,289
Karl calmly leaned his bicycle against the
Customs hut and disappeared inside.

89
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:20,069
At last, he reappeared, got on his bike and
an East German policeman raised the red-and-white

90
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:22,379
barrier pole.

91
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,569
He was through, he was coming towards them.

92
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:27,960
He had done it.

93
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:36,400
At that moment, Karl seemed to hear a sound
and know that there was danger.

94
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,990
He looked over his shoulder and began to move
faster.

95
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,910
An East German guard was on the bridge, watching
Karl as he came towards him.

96
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,050
Suddenly, the searchlights came on, shining
on Karl.

97
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,159
Then there was the sound of shouting and a
siren.

98
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:01,740
The East German guard dropped to his knees
and lifted his gun.

99
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:08,879
The first shot seemed to push Karl forwards,
and the second shot seemed to pull him back.

100
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,479
But he was still moving, still on the bicycle,
passing the guard who was still shooting at

101
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,849
him.

102
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:23,289
Then he fell from the bike to the ground.

103
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:28,449
Leamas hoped that Karl Riemeck was dead so
that the East German secret service could

104
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:34,020
not hurt him when they interrogated him.

105
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,819
CHAPTER TWO
The Circus

106
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:45,290
The plane took off, and Leamas looked out
of the window as West Berlin disappeared beneath

107
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,120
him.

108
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,849
Mundt had won.

109
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:54,129
Leamas was leaving Berlin without any agents
in East Germany.

110
00:07:54,129 --> 00:08:00,520
There had not been any agents when he arrived
in Germany, and he had recruited them all

111
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,530
himself.

112
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,819
Now he was leaving in the same way as he had
started.

113
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:13,199
And this was all because of Hans-Dieter Mundt,
the Head of Operations in the East German

114
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,240
secret service.

115
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,180
Mundt's agents had killed all of the agents
that Leamas had recruited.

116
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:30,039
Leamas knew that he had failed, and it was
the end of his career.

117
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,919
The airhostess brought Leamas a whisky.

118
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,162
She thought he was an interesting-looking
man, with his grey hair and brown eyes in

119
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:42,870
a handsome, bony face.

120
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,760
She thought he was around fifty, and this
was about right.

121
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,320
She thought he was single, which was half-true.

122
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,240
Long ago, there had been a wife.

123
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,600
Somewhere there were teenage children who
were given money by their father, paid from

124
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,700
a bank in London.

125
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:12,050
He looked like a man who could make trouble,
a man who was not quite a gentleman.

126
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:18,010
The taxi stopped outside a grey government
building in Cambridge Circus.

127
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,740
Leamas nodded to the man on the reception
desk at the Circus, the British Overseas Intelligence

128
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,240
agency, and went to the head of the agency's
office.

129
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,500
Control shook hands with Leamas.

130
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,130
"You must be tired," he said.

131
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,490
"Please sit down."

132
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,360
Leamas sat down opposite a small electric
fire.

133
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:51,510
Control was smaller than Leamas remembered,
but he still wore his old black jacket.

134
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:59,050
Today it was cold, and Control was wearing
a brown sweater under the jacket.

135
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,920
Control behaved in the way that he always
behaved - like a gentleman who knew he had

136
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,470
to be polite.

137
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:12,180
But Leamas knew Control was not really interested
in him.

138
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,610
Control took a packet of cigarettes from his
desk and gave one to Leamas.

139
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,090
Then he sat down opposite him.

140
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:27,800
There was a pause, and then finally Leamas
said, "Riemeck's dead."

141
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,810
"Yes, I know," replied Control.

142
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,279
"I suppose it was that woman who betrayed
him."

143
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,050
"I suppose so."

144
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,940
Leamas did not know how Control knew about
the woman.

145
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,130
"Mundt had him shot," Control added.

146
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,250
"And how did you feel?

147
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,970
When Riemeck was shot, I mean?"

148
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,029
Leamas shrugged.

149
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:01,529
"I was bloody angry," he said.

150
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,600
Control looked at him through half-closed
eyes.

151
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,640
"Didn't you feel more than that?

152
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,510
Weren't you upset?" he asked, thoughtfully.

153
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,350
"Yes, of course I was upset," said Leamas.

154
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,050
"Did you like Riemeck?"

155
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,720
asked Control.

156
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,810
Leamas shrugged.

157
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,160
"I suppose so," he said.

158
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,670
"How did you spend the night after he was
shot?" asked Control.

159
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,540
"What did you do?"

160
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:42,360
"Control," Leamas said, angrily, "why are
you asking me these questions?"

161
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,209
Control continued to talk thoughtfully.

162
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:49,580
"Riemeck was the last agent," he said.

163
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:56,550
"There was the girl they shot outside a cinema,
then the man in Dresden and some others who

164
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,740
were arrested.

165
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,600
Then Paul, Viereck, Salomon and Landser.

166
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,350
And finally, Riemeck.

167
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,570
That is quite a lot of people.

168
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,920
I wondered whether you'd had enough of your
job."

169
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,510
"What do you mean... enough?" asked Leamas.

170
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,320
"I wondered whether you were tired...

171
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,720
burned out?"

172
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,930
Leamas was silent.

173
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:32,920
Then at last, he said, "You must decide."

174
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,920
When Control spoke again, it was in the same
thoughtful way.

175
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,010
"In our jobs, we don't care about each other,
do we?

176
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,750
But we aren't like that really, are we?

177
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:52,100
I mean... we can't be out in the cold all
the time.

178
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,630
We have to come in from the cold.

179
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,310
Do you see what I mean?"

180
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,270
Leamas understood.

181
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,089
He sat silently again.

182
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:09,399
Then when he spoke at last, he said, "Control,
tell me.

183
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,490
What do you want me to do?"

184
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:19,320
"I want you to stay out in the cold a little
longer," said Control.

185
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,860
Leamas said nothing, so Control went on.

186
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:32,370
"In our work, we do bad things so that ordinary
people can sleep safely in their beds, don't

187
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,370
we?"

188
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,470
Leamas nodded.

189
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:40,820
"And since the war, our methods have become
quite similar to the methods of the other

190
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,829
side," Control continued.

191
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:50,230
"But of course, we use these methods for the
right reasons.

192
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:57,230
We have to be as ruthless as them, even though
our government's reasons are better than theirs."

193
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,199
"What is he saying?"

194
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:01,690
thought Leamas.

195
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,800
"I wish he would say what he means."

196
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:13,130
"That is why," Control continued, "I think
we ought to try to get rid of Mundt."

197
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,160
"Why?"

198
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,220
asked Leamas.

199
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,410
"We've got no one left in Germany to protect.

200
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,010
You just said this yourself.

201
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,190
Riemeck was the last one."

202
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,740
Control looked at his hands for a while without
speaking.

203
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,430
Finally, he said, "That isn't quite true.

204
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,010
But I don't think I need to tell you about
it."

205
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,209
Leamas shrugged.

206
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:48,410
"Tell me," said Control, "are you tired of
spying?

207
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,550
If you are, we'll need to get a different
person to do this job.

208
00:14:53,550 --> 00:15:00,470
What I am thinking about is not an ordinary
job - we need to stop Mundt's colleagues from

209
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,139
trusting him.

210
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:09,160
They have to believe that he is a traitor
- that he is working for us, not them - so

211
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,830
that they will get rid of him for us."

212
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,259
Leamas sat quietly, so Control went on.

213
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:22,110
"What do you know about Mundt?"

214
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,170
Leamas knew quite a lot about Mundt.

215
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:31,540
In his mind, he saw the photograph of the
East German spy in the Circus's files.

216
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,380
He saw an unfriendly face and white-blond
hair.

217
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,130
"He's forty-two," replied Leamas.

218
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,880
"He was born in Leipzig.

219
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,500
He has quickly become a very important person
in the East German secret service, and there

220
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,200
are now two really important men - Fiedler
and Mundt.

221
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:01,899
Mundt's own colleagues hate him because he
is so ruthless, and they are afraid of him."

222
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,839
Control nodded and then added to what Leamas
had said.

223
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,649
"He's a killer.

224
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:15,190
He was in this country two years ago, working
for an East German company.

225
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,610
We know that he killed two of his own agents.

226
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,750
He nearly killed our agent George Smiley,
too.

227
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,279
Mundt isn't a real Communist.

228
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,870
He is just fighting a war - the Cold War."

229
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,399
"Like us," said Leamas.

230
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,579
Control did not smile.

231
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:44,399
"George Smiley knows all about what happened
here," he continued.

232
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,540
"He isn't working for us anymore, but I think
you should talk to him.

233
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,060
Then, why don't you stay with me for the weekend?"

234
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,399
"Thanks, I'd like to," said Leamas.

235
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,620
"We can talk more about things then," said
Control.

236
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,540
"I think you might make a lot of money from
the other side.

237
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,760
You can keep all the money you make."

238
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,400
"Thanks," said Leamas.

239
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:22,150
"Of course, you must only do the job if you
want to... if you're sure that you're not

240
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,840
burned out," added Control.

241
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:32,110
"If you want to make trouble for Mundt, I'll
do it," said Leamas.

242
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,060
"Do you really feel that?"

243
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,140
Control asked.

244
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,560
"You mustn't think you have to say that, you
know.

245
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,660
After all, we all get burned out in the end,
in this job.

246
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:57,200
We don't hate or love anyone or anything - but
we don't want there to be any more pain."

247
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,730
Leamas did not answer, and Control went on.

248
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:06,040
"Isn't that what you thought after they killed
Karl Riemeck?

249
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,520
You didn't feel hate for Mundt or love for
Karl.

250
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,530
You didn't feel anything.

251
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:21,330
I was told that you walked all night through
the streets of Berlin after they killed him.

252
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,190
Is that right?"

253
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:31,760
"Yes," said Leamas, then added, "I'd like
to get rid of Mundt."

254
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,260
Control nodded understandingly.

255
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,140
"Good.

256
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,130
That's useful," he said.

257
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:46,600
"Now, if you meet any old friends in the Circus,
please don't discuss this with them."

258
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,650
"All right," said Leamas.

259
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:56,980
"In fact," continued Control, "make them think
that you're angry because we've behaved badly

260
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,950
to you.

261
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:05,940
You must begin to build a new life after today."

262
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,390
No one was surprised when Leamas did not go
back to Berlin.

263
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:17,180
He had failed there, and of course, he was
too old now to work with spies abroad.

264
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:24,280
He was given an easy job in the Circus's office
that made payments to people working abroad.

265
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:31,370
However, everyone was surprised at how quickly
Leamas went downhill.

266
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:37,010
He was angry about the way the Circus had
behaved towards him and spoke bitterly about

267
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,010
it.

268
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:45,470
He became dishonest, borrowing money from
colleagues and not paying it back.

269
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,290
At first, colleagues were kind to him, understanding
that he was having a bad time at the end of

270
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,610
his career.

271
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:59,520
But he was rude to them, and he did not shave
and his clothes were dirty.

272
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,140
So they stopped going near him.

273
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,630
He did not seem to care.

274
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:12,100
He ate alone in the dining room, and people
said that he had started to drink too much.

275
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,910
Then he disappeared from the Circus.

276
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,680
He did not say goodbye to anyone.

277
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,470
Soon everyone heard a story that someone had
stolen money from the office where Leamas

278
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,210
had worked.

279
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,730
It had happened just before Leamas disappeared.

280
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,850
People discussed it.

281
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,760
Was Leamas a thief?

282
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,010
For a week or two, they wondered what had
happened to him and where he had gone to,

283
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:48,340
but soon he was forgotten.

284
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,100
CHAPTER THREE
Liz

285
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,700
Leamas lived in a small, dirty flat on the
top floor of an old building.

286
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,650
There was a grocer's shop on the ground floor.

287
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,870
The flat had old, brown furniture and a brown
carpet with holes.

288
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,250
Bare light bulbs hung from the ceilings.

289
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,010
He needed a job.

290
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:21,540
Mr Pitt, who worked at the Labour Exchange,
offered him one at the Bayswater Library,

291
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:28,120
but Leamas did not want to work in a library,
so he said no.

292
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,540
Leamas thought he recognized Mr Pitt.

293
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,950
He was certain that he had seen him at the
Circus during the war, but the other man never

294
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,800
mentioned it.

295
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,530
Leamas spent a week working in a horrible
factory and a week trying to sell encyclopaedias

296
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,640
that nobody wanted.

297
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:56,110
After he lost these jobs, he drank more and
more at a pub near his flat.

298
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,790
Soon, people were used to seeing him there
and in the shops and on the streets near where

299
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,590
he lived.

300
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,930
He was a grey, dirty man who did not shave.

301
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,950
He never spoke to anyone.

302
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,580
He was a man who had to look in all his pockets
to find a bit of money.

303
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,620
His neighbours felt sorry for him.

304
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,800
Finally, Leamas took the job in the Bayswater
Library.

305
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:33,240
"The work will be easy for an intelligent
man like you," said Mr Pitt.

306
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:40,760
Bayswater Library was an old building with
lots of high bookcases in rows.

307
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,320
On the morning Leamas arrived there, he found
a young woman on a ladder near one of the

308
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,540
bookcases.

309
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,250
"I'm the new person," he said.

310
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,950
"My name's Leamas."

311
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,520
She climbed down and shook his hand.

312
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,830
"I'm Elizabeth Gold.

313
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,480
Call me Liz," the young woman said.

314
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,470
"Have you done this kind of work before?"

315
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,020
"No," he said.

316
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:17,160
"Well, I'm checking all the books at the moment,"
Liz said.

317
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,550
Liz was tall and bony, with long legs.

318
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:29,010
Her face was long, too, and she seemed to
be both plain and beautiful at the same time.

319
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,910
Leamas thought that she was twenty-two or
twenty-three.

320
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:38,560
"You need to check that all the books are
on the shelves," she said.

321
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,780
"There are boxes of cards.

322
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,770
When you've checked the number on the book,
you tick it on the card.

323
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,220
Why don't you look at the history books?"

324
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:57,380
She took him to a different bookcase, where
a shoebox of cards lay on the floor.

325
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,110
She left him there and went back to her work.

326
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:09,280
At 1 p.m., Leamas was hungry and asked Liz
Gold what happened about lunch.

327
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,680
"Oh," she replied, looking a bit embarrassed.

328
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,990
"I bring sandwiches.

329
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,320
There's no cafe near here.

330
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,230
You can have some of mine if you like."

331
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,800
Leamas shook his head.

332
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,260
"No, thanks.

333
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,900
I've got some shopping to do."

334
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,150
When Leamas returned, he smelt of whisky.

335
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,230
He went back to his bookcase and started checking
books again.

336
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:45,530
At 6 p.m., Liz locked the library, and they
left.

337
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:48,300
It was bitterly cold outside.

338
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:53,200
"Have you got far to go?" asked Leamas.

339
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,700
"No," said Liz.

340
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,910
"My flat's about twenty minutes' walk away.

341
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,930
What about you?"

342
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,870
"It's not far," he said.

343
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,500
"Good night."

344
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:15,550
About three weeks after Leamas began to work
at the library, Liz invited him to supper.

345
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:21,040
At 5 p.m., she pretended that she had suddenly
had the idea.

346
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,050
She had already realized that he would not
come if she invited him to come the next day

347
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:29,380
or next week.

348
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:35,180
Leamas did not seem very happy about visiting
her, but he came.

349
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,180
After that, there were many meals at Liz's
flat.

350
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,350
He always came when she asked him, but he
never spoke much.

351
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:49,520
Liz always suspected that there was something
wrong with Leamas.

352
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:59,460
"One day," she thought, "he is going to disappear,
and I'm never going to see him again."

353
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,700
She said to him one evening, "You must go
when you want to go, Alec.

354
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,730
I'll never follow you."

355
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,200
His brown eyes looked at her for a moment.

356
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,700
Then he said, "I'll tell you when I'm going
to go."

357
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:24,390
One evening, she said, "Alec, what do you
believe in?

358
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,500
Don't laugh - tell me."

359
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,210
She waited, and at last, he shrugged and said
nothing.

360
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,330
"But you must believe in something," she said.

361
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,030
"Something like God - I know you do.

362
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:45,620
Sometimes you look like you've got something
special to do."

363
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,880
She saw Leamas's smile and hated it.

364
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,590
"Alec, don't smile," she said.

365
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,600
"It's true."

366
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,900
He stopped smiling.

367
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:01,820
"Sorry, Liz, but you're wrong," he said.

368
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,040
Liz knew he was getting angry, but she continued
speaking.

369
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:12,650
"You don't like conversations like this because
you hate something, don't you?"

370
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,710
she said.

371
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:19,460
"You're like a man who is going to do something
awful."

372
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:25,650
The brown eyes looked at her, and when he
spoke, his voice frightened her.

373
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:33,040
"If I were you," he said, "I wouldn't ask
questions."

374
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,390
And then he smiled gently.

375
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:41,970
Liz hadn't seen him smile like that before
- he was being kind to her now.

376
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,840
"What do you believe in?" he asked.

377
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,640
"Are you religious?"

378
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,670
"No, of course not.

379
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,410
I don't believe in God," she replied.

380
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,250
"Then what do you believe in?"

381
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,580
"I believe in...

382
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,580
I'm...

383
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,050
I'm a Communist," she said, quickly.

384
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,520
He started to laugh.

385
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,830
"Oh, Liz, no!

386
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,380
You're not a bloody Communist!"

387
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,410
"I am," she said, looking embarrassed.

388
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:24,370
She was angry that he laughed, but she was
also happy that he did not care very much.

389
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,030
That night they became lovers.

390
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,070
He left at 5 a.m.

391
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,550
She could not understand why he seemed ashamed.

392
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:38,220
She was not ashamed.

393
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,260
Leamas walked down the empty street towards
a park.

394
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:48,550
It was foggy, so he did not see a man standing
by the entrance to the park.

395
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:56,320
By the time Leamas got to the entrance, the
man had gone.

396
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:04,900
Then one day, about a week later, Leamas did
not come into work, and Liz was worried.

397
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:10,790
The next morning she arrived early at the
library, and by the end of the morning, she

398
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,890
knew he would never come back to his job.

399
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:20,280
She had promised never to follow him, but
he had promised to tell her when he was going

400
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,270
away.

401
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:25,520
Should she go and find him?

402
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,520
At lunchtime, she went to Leamas's flat.

403
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,100
She went up the dark stairs and knocked on
the door.

404
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,450
No one came.

405
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,850
She turned the handle, and the door opened.

406
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:44,020
Quietly, she went into the flat.

407
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:51,080
It was bitterly cold and dark, but she could
see a shape lying on the bed in the corner.

408
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,850
She opened the curtains.

409
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:57,840
Leamas was sweating, and his eyes were closed.

410
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,050
He had not shaved for days, and Liz could
see his dark beard against the white of his

411
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,320
face.

412
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,320
She was frightened, but she soon decided what
to do.

413
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:17,150
In the next few hours, she ran to the chemist
to buy medicine, bought soup and soft biscuits,

414
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,640
and made tea.

415
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:27,400
She held Leamas's head so he could drink and
eat, whispering his name over and over again.

416
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:35,450
At last, he stopped sweating and relaxed,
and he fell asleep.

417
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,230
Then Liz cleaned the flat.

418
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,560
When he woke, it was 8.30 p.m.

419
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,010
"Alec, don't be cross with me.

420
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,740
You're ill.

421
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,890
You need me to look after you," she said.

422
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:58,250
For six days, she made him eat and helped
him to wash and shave.

423
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:04,980
Watching him get stronger after his illness,
she thought she'd never been so happy.

424
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:11,010
He did not speak much, and once, when she
asked him if he loved her, he said he did

425
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:15,730
not believe in happy endings to stories.

426
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:20,620
She often lay on the bed with her head close
to his.

427
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:29,030
Then, on Friday evening when she came home,
he was dressed, but he had not shaved.

428
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:33,830
She was afraid, although she did not know
why.

429
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:39,530
She cooked their supper while Leamas sat on
the bed without speaking.

430
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:44,330
While they were eating, she suddenly cried
out, "Alec!

431
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,470
Are you leaving?"

432
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:54,090
He took her hands in his and kissed her in
a way he had never done before.

433
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:59,300
He spoke quietly, but she did not understand
what he said.

434
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,280
She only knew that it was the end.

435
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:07,210
"Goodbye, Liz," he said.

436
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,480
"Goodbye."

437
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,820
And then, he added, "Don't follow me.

438
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,350
Not again."

439
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:24,630
Liz nodded, and she went out into the bitter
cold of the street outside.

440
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:32,540
The next morning, Leamas went to the grocer's
shop downstairs and ordered a number of things.

441
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,420
When the man had put them in a bag, Leamas
picked it up.

442
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,600
"I'll pay for these later," he said.

443
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:48,140
The grocer smiled politely and said, "I'm
sorry, but you can't do that."

444
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,310
"Why not?" asked Leamas, angrily.

445
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,670
The other customers in the shop looked at
each other nervously.

446
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,950
"I don't know you," replied the grocer.

447
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,020
"Don't be stupid.

448
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:06,880
I've been coming in here for four months,"
said Leamas.

449
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,770
"You must pay for the groceries," said the
grocer.

450
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,910
"I don't know you, and I don't like you.

451
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,570
Now get out of my shop."

452
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:25,450
And he put out his hand to take the bag away
from Leamas.

453
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,460
The other customers were not certain what
happened next.

454
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,790
Did the grocer push Leamas or not?

455
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:37,890
They saw that Leamas hit the grocer with his
left hand while he was still holding the bag

456
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,860
in his right hand.

457
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:46,450
Some of the customers thought he hit the grocer
twice, once on his neck with the side of his

458
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,840
left hand and then with his left elbow.

459
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,530
But he moved so quickly that they were not
really certain what he did.

460
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:03,990
They saw the grocer fall over and lie completely
still on the floor.

461
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:09,870
There was evidence at his trial that Leamas
had broken the bones in the grocer's jaw and

462
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,720
in one of his cheeks.

463
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:20,350
Leamas's lawyer did not disagree, and Leamas
was sentenced to three months in prison.

464
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:27,820
Some people learned about the trial in small
articles in the newspapers.

465
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,470
CHAPTER FOUR
Ashe contacts Leamas

466
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:38,020
After three months, Leamas left the prison.

467
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:44,060
It was a beautiful, sunny day, and there were
bright flowers everywhere.

468
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:49,350
He decided to walk across the parks in the
centre of London and have a big meal at a

469
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,040
cafe near Charing Cross Station.

470
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,940
He was carrying a parcel with clothes and
documents in it.

471
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:03,751
He decided that he did not need the clothes,
and he wanted to get rid of the parcel, but

472
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:08,770
it was too big to put in a rubbish bin.

473
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:12,970
After a while, he sat down on a wooden seat.

474
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:18,170
Then he left the parcel on the seat and walked
away.

475
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,540
Leamas heard a shout and looked back over
his shoulder.

476
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,600
There was a man holding the parcel in his
hands.

477
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,500
Leamas shrugged and walked on.

478
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,280
There was another shout and Leamas heard someone
running.

479
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,740
A tall man with short brown hair stopped next
to him.

480
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,510
"This is your parcel, isn't it?" he said.

481
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,120
"Why didn't you stop when I called you?"

482
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,150
"You can put it back on the seat," said Leamas.

483
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,230
"I don't want it."

484
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:56,490
"You can't just leave it there," said the
man.

485
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:01,850
"I bloody well can leave it there," said Leamas.

486
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:07,230
He was going to move on, but the stranger
stood in front of him with the parcel.

487
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,550
"Why are you being so rude?" asked the stranger.

488
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,520
"I was trying to be helpful."

489
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,540
"If you are just trying to be helpful, why
have you been following me for the last half

490
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,910
an hour?" asked Leamas.

491
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:29,590
Leamas saw that the man was thinking quickly
about what to say next.

492
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:33,820
"He's quite good at his job," he thought.

493
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:40,530
"I thought you were somebody I once knew in
Berlin," the stranger replied.

494
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:45,130
"So you followed me for half an hour?"

495
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,700
Leamas's brown eyes looked carefully at the
man.

496
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,020
"It hasn't been half an hour.

497
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:56,660
I saw you a few minutes ago, and I thought
you were Alec Leamas.

498
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,540
I borrowed some money from him.

499
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,390
That's why I followed you.

500
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:07,570
So if you were Alec, I could pay the money
back."

501
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:12,200
Leamas thought then that maybe the man was
not very good at his job.

502
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,880
It was not a very good story.

503
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,500
"I'm Leamas," he replied.

504
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,650
"Who are you?"

505
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,690
The stranger told Leamas that his name was
Bill Ashe.

506
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:31,940
Ashe told Leamas a long story about how they
had met in Berlin and why Ashe had borrowed

507
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,980
money from Leamas.

508
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:39,910
"I was very embarrassed that I had to borrow
money from you," said Ashe.

509
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:45,510
"Of course I remember you," said Leamas.

510
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,810
"Of course."

511
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:51,630
Leamas and Ashe talked in the cafe for hours.

512
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:57,920
A small man in glasses sat at the next table
and read a very boring book.

513
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,570
At last, Ashe pulled his chequebook out of
his pocket and started to write a cheque for

514
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,350
twenty pounds.

515
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,190
Leamas looked embarrassed and stopped him.

516
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,270
"I haven't got a bank account at the moment,"
he said.

517
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:18,390
"I've just returned from abroad.

518
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,410
Could you let me have cash?"

519
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:23,420
"Of course," Ashe said.

520
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:30,020
"Meet me here tomorrow at one o'clock, and
I'll bring you cash."

521
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:35,630
When they left the cafe, Leamas left the parcel
of clothes there.

522
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:42,770
Ashe got in a taxi near the cafe, and Leamas
waved till it disappeared.

523
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:49,310
Leamas guessed that he was still being followed,
so for several hours he walked and got on

524
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:52,310
and off buses and trains.

525
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:57,160
Finally, he walked to a house in West London.

526
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,840
When he knocked on the door, Control opened
it.

527
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,540
"Come in," he said.

528
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,250
"I've borrowed George Smiley's house."

529
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:13,370
"I was followed till lunchtime," Leamas said.

530
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:18,700
Then he told Control the story of his life
since he hit the grocer, ending with his meeting

531
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,910
with Ashe that day.

532
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:27,050
"I'm sorry we couldn't help you while you
were in prison," Control said.

533
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,230
"And I heard that you were ill.

534
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,870
I'm sorry about that, too.

535
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,320
How long were you ill?"

536
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,000
"About ten days," replied Leamas.

537
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,140
"Oh dear," said Control.

538
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:47,700
"You were ill for ten days with no one to
look after you?"

539
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,430
There was a very long silence.

540
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:58,470
Then Control said, "You know that the girl
is a Communist, don't you?"

541
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,530
"Yes," said Leamas.

542
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,320
There was another long silence.

543
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,160
Then he said, "You mustn't involve her in
this.

544
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,850
I'll look after her myself when I return.

545
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,140
I just want you to forget her."

546
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:20,180
"Of course we won't involve her," replied
Control.

547
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:26,190
"Who was the man called Pitt in the Labour
Exchange?" asked Leamas.

548
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:31,390
"I don't know anyone called Pitt," said Control.

549
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:37,380
"Oh, I'm sure you don't," said Leamas, crossly.

550
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,500
Then he said, "Why isn't Smiley here?"

551
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,350
"Didn't he tell you when you visited him?"

552
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,770
replied Control.

553
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,810
"He doesn't like the job that you're going
to do."

554
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:55,330
"No, we just talked about Mundt," said Leamas.

555
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,460
"But does he agree that it has to be done?"

556
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,500
"Yes," replied Control.

557
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:09,700
"He knows why we need to do it, but he is
like a doctor who is tired of seeing blood.

558
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:15,400
He is happy for other people to do the operations."

559
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,950
Then Leamas asked, "How do we know that I
was contacted today by the right person?

560
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:27,270
Are you certain that he works for the East
Germans?"

561
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,060
Control replied calmly.

562
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,210
"Don't worry, Leamas.

563
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,680
We've organized things."

564
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,500
Then he put his hand on Leamas's shoulder.

565
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,350
"This is your last job," he said.

566
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:49,670
"Then you can come in from the cold..."

567
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:54,690
Leamas nodded to Control and quietly left
the house.

568
00:41:54,690 --> 00:42:00,500
He went out into the cold.

569
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,150
CHAPTER FIVE
Kiever

570
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:10,220
When he met Ashe the next day, Leamas smelt
of whisky.

571
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:17,110
But Ashe was very happy to see him and gave
him an envelope of cash - twenty notes.

572
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:25,090
"Thanks," said Leamas, who had not shaved
and was wearing a dirty shirt.

573
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:29,100
He called the waiter and ordered drinks.

574
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:35,990
When the drinks arrived, Leamas's hand shook
as he poured some water into his whisky.

575
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:40,540
Ashe talked a lot about himself while they
had lunch.

576
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:48,060
He told Leamas about a friend called Sam Kiever
who paid him and other people to write articles

577
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:53,210
about the United Kingdom for foreign newspapers.

578
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:57,910
Leamas just let Ashe talk while he drank a
lot.

579
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:03,350
He did not talk about himself, and he did
not ask any questions.

580
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:09,480
"You don't know Sam, do you?" asked Ashe at
last.

581
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,290
"Who's Sam?" asked Leamas, looking confused.

582
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:18,710
Ashe sounded quite cross when he replied.

583
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,030
"Sam.

584
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,030
Sam Kiever.

585
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,830
The man I was telling you about," he said.

586
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,020
"Maybe you've met him."

587
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,520
"I don't think so."

588
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,800
There was a pause.

589
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,770
"What do you do these days?

590
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:37,990
What job, I mean?" asked Ashe.

591
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,230
Leamas shrugged.

592
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,910
"Nothing much," he replied.

593
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,900
"What was it that you did in Berlin?" asked
Ashe.

594
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:53,430
"Weren't you one of those cold-war people?"

595
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,750
Leamas was surprised at the direct question.

596
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,520
"Ashe must want to recruit me quickly," he
thought.

597
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,640
"I was just doing things for the Americans,"
he answered, pretending to be angry.

598
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,280
"That's what we all did."

599
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:17,410
"You know," said Ashe, "I've been thinking
that you ought to meet Sam.

600
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,450
You'd like him.

601
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,810
Where do you live?

602
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:25,190
Tell me, and then I can get in touch with
you and bring Sam."

603
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:29,590
"I don't live anywhere," said Leamas.

604
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:32,600
"I haven't got a job or any money.

605
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,720
I just sleep where I can.

606
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,480
The company that I worked for behaved badly
to me."

607
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,410
Ashe looked upset.

608
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:45,810
"You must come and stay with me," he said.

609
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,670
"I can't do that," replied Leamas.

610
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,890
"I'll be all right.

611
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,811
I'll get a job.

612
00:44:53,811 --> 00:44:56,500
I've had jobs before."

613
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,940
And then he continued, still sounding angry.

614
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,720
"I had jobs after they got rid of me.

615
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,460
I worked in a horrible factory.

616
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,890
I sold encyclopaedias.

617
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:11,980
I got bored in a library."

618
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:16,460
"Leamas, you need a better job," replied Ashe.

619
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:22,790
"You worked in Berlin for years, so you must
speak German well.

620
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:25,750
There are lots of things you could do.

621
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:31,270
But you need to know useful people, don't
you see?"

622
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,940
Ashe sounded almost happy now.

623
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,040
"Come and stay with me.

624
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,680
Where are your things?"

625
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,150
"I haven't got any," said Leamas.

626
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:50,360
"Everything I had was in the parcel, and I
left that in this cafe."

627
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,220
Ashe lived in a small flat in Dolphin Square.

628
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:59,800
There was not much furniture, and there were
a few pictures from Germany.

629
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,000
It was what Leamas had expected.

630
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,090
Ashe made some tea, and then he said that
he had to go out and do some shopping.

631
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:13,560
"Why don't you get some sleep, Alec?" he said
to Leamas.

632
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,700
"You look really tired."

633
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:23,730
Then he touched Leamas gently on his shoulder
and went out.

634
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:30,900
A few minutes later, Leamas went out, too,
carefully leaving the door unlocked.

635
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,870
He went to one of the public telephones on
the ground floor and rang a number.

636
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:43,500
"I'm ringing about Mr Sam Kiever," Leamas
said to the voice that answered the phone.

637
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:49,220
"He is coming to a meeting this; evening at
this address."

638
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,150
Then he gave the voice the address in Dolphin
Square.

639
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:59,880
"I'll give the information to Control," said
the voice.

640
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,560
Leamas was woken up by Ashe returning.

641
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:10,090
With him was a small, fat man with grey hair
who was wearing an expensive suit.

642
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:12,630
He sounded like a foreigner.

643
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,860
Perhaps he was German - Leamas was not sure.

644
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,220
He said that his name was Sam Kiever.

645
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,480
They went to eat at a Chinese restaurant.

646
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:30,920
The food was good and so was the wine and
Ashe paid the bill.

647
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:36,490
Then they went to a bar, and Ashe continued
to buy Leamas drinks - Leamas was drinking

648
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,780
whisky now.

649
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,980
Kiever seemed a bit bored.

650
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:48,860
Then Leamas leaned across the table and said
to Ashe, "Now tell me what is going on!"

651
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,670
"What do you mean, Alec?"

652
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:53,740
Ashe sounded surprised.

653
00:47:53,740 --> 00:48:00,720
"I mean that you followed me from prison yesterday,"
Leamas said, quietly.

654
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,550
"You've told me a stupid story about meeting
me in Berlin.

655
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,560
You've given me money that you didn't owe
me.

656
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,860
You've bought me expensive meals, and now
I'm staying at your flat.

657
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,530
I'm asking why."

658
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:21,840
There was silence, and then Kiever spoke.

659
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,850
"You go home," he said to Ashe.

660
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:30,750
"I'll talk to Mr Leamas."

661
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:37,710
After Ashe had gone, Leamas leaned forward
across the table again and said, "Are you

662
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,030
going to tell me what's going on?"

663
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:42,320
Kiever nodded.

664
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,270
"Of course.

665
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:47,860
I told Ashe to contact you."

666
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,450
"Why?"

667
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:52,800
"I'm interested in you.

668
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,290
I want to make a suggestion to you.

669
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:03,720
I have a company that asks people to write
interesting articles for my customers abroad.

670
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:10,170
You've got memories of your international
experience that one of my customers will pay

671
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,170
for.

672
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:17,520
They pay quickly, and then they ask for more
information.

673
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,630
They are happy to pay money into foreign banks."

674
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,960
Leamas said nothing.

675
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:30,900
"Why is the other side hurrying?" he thought.

676
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,870
Then he answered his own question in his head.

677
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:41,950
"I'm a man with no money, who has just come
out of prison, and I'm angry with the secret

678
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,410
service that I worked for.

679
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:49,090
A man like me would want to be paid by the
other side for his knowledge."

680
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:58,530
"They'd have to pay me a lot for my knowledge,"
he said, quietly.

681
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:07,210
"My customer is offering a first payment of
fifteen thousand pounds," said Kiever.

682
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:13,360
"My customer wants to talk to you now, and
you can have the money as soon as you have

683
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,850
talked to him.

684
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:22,680
You will receive another five thousand pounds
if you give my customer more information during

685
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,030
the next year.

686
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:30,220
And you will get help to move to any country
in the world."

687
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:36,750
"How soon do you want an answer?" asked Leamas.

688
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,830
"Now," said Kiever.

689
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:44,310
"You will meet my customer tomorrow and talk
to him.

690
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:48,130
Then he will arrange for someone to write
down your memories."

691
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:54,230
"Where would I meet your customer?" asked
Leamas.

692
00:50:54,230 --> 00:51:01,400
"It would be simpler to meet outside the United
Kingdom," replied Kiever.

693
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,730
"My customer has suggested a meeting in Holland."

694
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:10,100
"I haven't got a passport," said Leamas.

695
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:15,570
"I have a passport for you," said Kiever,
calmly.

696
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:20,450
"We're flying to The Hague tomorrow morning
at nine forty-five.

697
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:24,970
Shall we go to my flat?"

698
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:30,510
Kiever's flat was in an expensive part of
London.

699
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:35,450
He didn't want to talk, and Leamas realized
that he was nervous.

700
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:38,270
They were both nervous.

701
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:45,530
Kiever took Leamas to a bedroom, and the next
morning he was woken by Kiever at 6 a.m.

702
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:49,850
"I haven't got any luggage," said Leamas.

703
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:56,210
"I've organized your luggage and a British
passport," replied Kiever.

704
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:03,280
The passport had his name and details and
a photograph.

705
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,790
Leamas looked at the date on it.

706
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:11,460
"This passport runs out very soon," he said
to Kiever.

707
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:21,240
"My customer doesn't want you to be able to
go to other places easily," replied Kiever,

708
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,150
laughing.

709
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:27,920
As Kiever answered, Leamas felt nervous again.

710
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,660
His life would never be the same after today.

711
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,590
"You won't need any money," Kiever said.

712
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:43,440
"The customer is paying for everything."

713
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,050
CHAPTER SIX
The house by the sea

714
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:55,240
After the plane landed in The Hague, Kiever
and Leamas went quickly through the airport.

715
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:03,140
"Have a nice stay in Holland," said the Dutch
passport officer.

716
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:08,840
As they walked through the airport to the
exit, Leamas looked back.

717
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:14,310
He saw a man with glasses standing reading
an English newspaper.

718
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:19,870
He was small, and he looked worried.

719
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:24,100
Leamas and Kiever got into a car in the car
park.

720
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:29,180
The driver never spoke as she drove them out
of The Hague.

721
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,690
Leamas had been there during the war, and
he guessed that they were travelling towards

722
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,660
the coast.

723
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:43,280
After a short time, the car stopped at a small
house by the sea, and a friendly woman opened

724
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,680
the door and let them in.

725
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:51,280
Leamas saw a man in a raincoat getting out
of another car.

726
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,180
"Welcome," the woman said.

727
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,140
"Did you have a good journey?"

728
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,720
"Yes," replied Kiever.

729
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,680
"It was a very good flight."

730
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:08,770
"That's good," she replied, and she disappeared.

731
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:17,880
During Leamas's stay in the house, she brought
meals to them, usually bread and cold meat.

732
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:23,700
Then Kiever opened the front door, and the
man in the raincoat came in.

733
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,290
He was the same height as Leamas but older.

734
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:29,850
He shook Leamas's hand.

735
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,860
"My name is Peters," he said.

736
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,040
"Did you have a good flight?"

737
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,300
"Yes" replied Kiever, quickly.

738
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:47,090
"Mr Leamas and I have a lot to discuss," said
Peters to Kiever.

739
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:50,700
"You can leave now."

740
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,100
Kiever smiled.

741
00:54:52,100 --> 00:55:00,550
"Goodbye and good luck," he said to Leamas
and held out his hand.

742
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:04,410
Leamas nodded, but did not shake his hand.

743
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:08,359
Kiever left the house quietly.

744
00:55:08,359 --> 00:55:13,410
Peters went into a room at the back of the
house, and Leamas followed him.

745
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:19,090
"Listen," said Leamas, suddenly, sounding
very nervous.

746
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,620
"We both know why we're here.

747
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:26,310
I'm a defector, and you're going to pay me
for information.

748
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:31,640
You don't all have to pretend that you like
me and want to be nice to me."

749
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:40,830
"Kiever told me that you were a proud man,"
replied Peters, sitting down at a table.

750
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:43,730
He spoke English very well.

751
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:47,510
Leamas guessed that he was Russian, but he
was not sure.

752
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,010
He sat down, too.

753
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:56,950
"Kiever told you what we are going to pay
you, didn't he?" asked Peters.

754
00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:03,200
"He said that you would pay me fifteen thousand
pounds now," replied Leamas.

755
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,680
"And he said that you would pay me another
five thousand pounds if I talk to you during

756
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,330
the next year."

757
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:15,320
"Yes, that's right," replied Peters.

758
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:22,190
"I won't accept the five thousand pounds,
and I won't talk to you during the next year,"

759
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:23,190
said Leamas.

760
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:26,720
"You know that I can't do that.

761
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,820
I want to take the fifteen thousand pounds
and get away.

762
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:36,950
If I tell you everything I know, I will have
to disappear.

763
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:43,690
The British secret service will know what
I've done and look for me immediately."

764
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:50,750
Peters nodded, and then he said, "But you
could come somewhere safer with us, couldn't

765
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,010
you?"

766
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:56,480
"Are you asking me to come behind the Iron
Curtain?"

767
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,650
asked Leamas.

768
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,250
Peters nodded again.

769
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:06,460
"I don't want to do that," Leamas said, very
quickly.

770
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:13,910
Peters nodded, then said, "Shall we start?"

771
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:19,050
During the morning of the first day, Peters
asked questions about what Leamas had done

772
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:21,700
during the war.

773
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:27,020
Leamas told him about being in the army and
then getting a number of different jobs because

774
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:31,190
he spoke Dutch, German and French.

775
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:36,300
Leamas had learned the languages when he lived
in Holland because his father had an engineering

776
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,750
factory there.

777
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:44,120
The British secret service had trained him,
and he had worked with spies in Holland and

778
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,200
Norway during the war.

779
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,990
After the war, he had gone to Berlin.

780
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:55,030
Peters saw that Leamas was sweating.

781
00:57:55,030 --> 00:58:02,810
He saw a man who wanted to betray his country
but was upset and uncomfortable.

782
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:07,080
This was what Leamas wanted him to see.

783
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:13,240
Leamas watched Peters, too, and decided that
he was good at his job.

784
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:18,730
Peters listened carefully, only asking a few
questions.

785
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:24,560
Leamas told Peters about starting to work
in Berlin in the 1950s.

786
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:30,359
The British needed to get information from
East Germany, but it was hard to find good

787
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:31,359
agents.

788
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:39,550
At last, in 1959, Karl Riemeck made contact
with him, first by leaving photographs and

789
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,820
documents in Leamas's car.

790
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,359
Then they had met.

791
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:50,119
Riemeck worked for the Praesidium of the East
German government.

792
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:55,720
He did not have a very important job, but
he gave Leamas enormous amounts of useful

793
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,690
information about Praesidium meetings.

794
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:05,500
He also gave Leamas the names and jobs of
people in the East German secret service.

795
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:11,710
"Did Riemeck give you all the information
you're telling me about?"

796
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:12,720
Peters asked.

797
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,960
"Yes, of course," replied Leamas.

798
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,210
"I see," said Peters.

799
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:25,140
"Please go on."

800
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:31,000
Peters filled Leamas's glass with more whisky,
as he had done often during the interrogation,

801
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,450
and Leamas continued.

802
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:39,730
Bit by bit, he told Peters all about Riemeck's
work.

803
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:45,020
He gave the names of other agents who Riemeck
had introduced to Leamas and the dates they

804
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:48,280
had started being agents.

805
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:54,680
He explained what the Circus had thought and
how much they had paid Riemeck.

806
00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:01,140
Peters was pleased at how good Leamas's memory
was even though he was drinking so much.

807
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:07,300
"I don't believe you," said Peters after a
while.

808
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,620
"Riemeck's job wasn't important enough.

809
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,550
He couldn't do all this on his own."

810
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:19,250
"He did do it," said Leamas, suddenly becoming
angry.

811
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:27,220
"Didn't the Circus wonder whether there was
another person helping him?" asked Peters.

812
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:30,280
"No," replied Leamas.

813
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:36,470
"Oh, that's interesting," said Peters, thoughtfully.

814
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:43,460
Then, after a moment, he said, "You heard
about Riemeck's woman, didn't you?"

815
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:47,470
"What about her?" asked Leamas.

816
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:51,100
"She was murdered a week ago.

817
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:56,590
She was shot as she left a flat in West Berlin."

818
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,680
Leamas was very surprised.

819
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:05,760
"She was in West Berlin - why wasn't she safe
there?" he thought.

820
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,920
"Did Riemeck tell her the name of another
East German agent?

821
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:18,430
And did that agent arrange for someone to
kill her so she didn't tell anyone the name?"

822
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:23,020
That night, Leamas continued to think about
the woman's death.

823
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:29,090
"Why didn't Control tell me about it?" he
wondered.

824
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:34,690
He remembered his question to Control about
why they should get rid of Mundt, and Control's

825
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:36,440
answer.

826
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,970
He had asked: "Why?

827
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:41,780
We've got no one left in Germany to protect.

828
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:46,650
You just said so yourself Riemeck was the
last one."

829
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:51,670
And Control had replied: "That isn't quite
true.

830
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:54,820
But I don't think I need to tell you about
it."

831
01:01:54,820 --> 01:02:00,340
"What did Control know that he didn't tell
me?"

832
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,520
Leamas thought.

833
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:07,140
"And why didn't he tell me?"

834
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:16,440
That night he thought about the murdered woman,
and then he thought about Liz.

835
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,820
CHAPTER SEVEN

836
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:21,859
Bad news

837
01:02:21,859 --> 01:02:28,050
Peters arrived at the house at 8 a.m. the
next morning and immediately started the interrogation

838
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,860
again.

839
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:35,290
He asked Leamas about his time in London since
leaving Berlin.

840
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:39,690
Leamas told him the story that he had agreed
with Control.

841
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:44,670
He told him about working in the office at
the Circus that made payments to people working

842
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,460
abroad.

843
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:51,490
He explained that he was bored, that he had
started to drink and that he had been asked

844
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:54,099
to leave.

845
01:02:54,099 --> 01:02:57,619
Peters was interested in his last job at the
Circus.

846
01:02:57,619 --> 01:03:01,730
"Tell me what you did," he said.

847
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:06,200
"I made payments to agents," replied Leamas.

848
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:11,960
"I got letters telling me to write cheques,
but I never had the names of the agents or

849
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,940
where they were in the world.

850
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:20,930
But sometimes they gave me too much information,
so I did know who was going to be paid.

851
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:27,570
I made a list last night of all the payments
that I could remember."

852
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:31,760
Leamas gave Peters his list, and Peters read
it carefully.

853
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,609
"This is good," he said.

854
01:03:35,609 --> 01:03:38,040
"Very good."

855
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,400
Leamas continued.

856
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:45,250
"I remember an operation called Rolling Stone
best," he said.

857
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:50,090
"I made two trips abroad because I was working
on it.

858
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:55,980
One trip was to Denmark - to Copenhagen - and
one was to Finland - to Helsinki.

859
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,650
I had to deposit money in banks."

860
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:02,110
"How much money?"

861
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:10,770
"Ten thousand dollars in Copenhagen and forty
thousand dollars in Helsinki," replied Leamas.

862
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:14,830
"Who was the money for?" asked Peters.

863
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:18,590
"I don't know," replied Leamas.

864
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:21,480
"Control didn't tell me."

865
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:29,280
"Was Control managing the operation himself?"
asked Peters.

866
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,790
"Yes," said Leamas.

867
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:35,540
"I had some information but not all of it."

868
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:40,190
He gave a lot more information about Rolling
Stone to Peters.

869
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:44,470
He explained that the Circus gave him false
documents for the person who would get the

870
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:48,260
money from the Danish and Finnish banks.

871
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:54,190
He told Peters that some payments were made
before he was working in the office.

872
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:57,190
Peters wrote everything down carefully.

873
01:04:57,190 --> 01:05:04,290
"What were the names the person had to use
to withdraw the money from the banks?" he

874
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,290
asked.

875
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:10,560
"Horst Karlsdorf and Adolf Fechtmann," said
Leamas.

876
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,720
"Those are both German names," said Peters.

877
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:20,849
"Yes, but the person wasn't German," replied
Leamas, quickly.

878
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:25,880
"Why are you sure about that?" asked Peters.

879
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,920
"Because I was Head of Operations in Berlin.

880
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:35,410
I would have known if we were paying large
amounts of money to an East German agent,"

881
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:38,560
said Leamas, beginning to sound angry.

882
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:45,650
"Are you sure there wasn't another agent for
the British working in East Germany?" asked

883
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,650
Peters.

884
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:49,110
"I'm sure there wasn't!"

885
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:52,609
shouted Leamas, now very angry.

886
01:05:52,609 --> 01:05:55,240
He remembered what Control had said.

887
01:05:55,240 --> 01:06:01,350
"Give them your information, and let them
work out what to think.

888
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:07,420
It will be good to make them think that they
know more than you."

889
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:12,270
Peters nodded as if he understood something
about Leamas.

890
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:16,869
He thought that Leamas was angry that the
Circus might have an agent in East Germany

891
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:19,630
who Leamas did not know about.

892
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:28,530
"You are a very proud man, Mr Leamas," he
said.

893
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:32,609
Peters left the house at lunchtime on the
second day.

894
01:06:32,609 --> 01:06:39,540
He did not appear that afternoon, and he did
not appear the next morning, either.

895
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:45,000
Leamas asked the woman who brought his meals
where Peters was, but she just smiled and

896
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
shrugged.

897
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,070
At last, he decided to go for a walk by the
sea.

898
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:57,420
There was a girl on the beach throwing pieces
of bread to the seabirds.

899
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,870
Leamas thought about Liz.

900
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:05,840
He wanted to do simple things with her, like
throw bread to seabirds.

901
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:10,630
He wanted love and to have a new life with
her.

902
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:14,420
He would be home soon - perhaps in two weeks.

903
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:21,440
He would have plenty of money, and he could
come in from the cold.

904
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:26,180
When he got back to the house, he heard the
woman make a phone call.

905
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:33,760
Finally, at 3 p.m., Peters arrived, and, as
soon as Leamas saw him, he knew that there

906
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,190
was a problem.

907
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:40,320
Peters did not take off his coat and did not
sit down.

908
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:44,400
"I've got bad news for you," said Peters.

909
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,990
"I heard it this morning.

910
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:51,580
The police are searching for you in England.

911
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:55,320
They're checking ships and planes that are
leaving the country."

912
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,870
"Why do they want me?"

913
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,130
thought Leamas.

914
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:05,220
He was shocked and confused, but he stayed
silent.

915
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:11,390
"There are articles in all the newspapers,
but they just say that police want to talk

916
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:12,990
to you.

917
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:18,819
They don't say that you have defected, but
they mention the Official Secrets Act, so

918
01:08:18,819 --> 01:08:22,910
people will think that you are a spy."

919
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,920
"This wasn't part of the plan.

920
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,319
I'm supposed to be able to go home in two
weeks," he thought.

921
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:35,010
"Why has Control done this?"

922
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:40,130
Leamas felt angry with Control, and worried,
but he tried to think quickly.

923
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:45,400
"What am I going to do?" he asked himself.

924
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,370
"I could refuse to talk any more to Peters.

925
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:56,239
But if I stop acting my part now, the operation
against Mundt will fail."

926
01:08:56,239 --> 01:09:02,170
"Every police force in Western Europe will
be looking for you," said Peters.

927
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:05,370
"You've got a choice.

928
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:10,630
You can let us look after you - we can arrange
to take you to the East.

929
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:17,520
Or you can go away alone - but you will definitely
be caught.

930
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:24,480
You don't have any money, your passport runs
out in ten days and you don't have any false

931
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,940
documents."

932
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:33,430
"If I come with you, what will you do with
me when you have completed your interrogation?"

933
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:35,560
asked Leamas.

934
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,670
Peters shrugged.

935
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:40,400
"We'll give you a new passport, probably.

936
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,130
Then you can go where you want."

937
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:45,839
Leamas stared out of the window.

938
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:51,710
At last, he said, "All right, I'll come."

939
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:56,420
"There's no plane to the East until tomorrow,"
said Peters.

940
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:00,560
"But there's a flight to Berlin in an hour.

941
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,980
We need to leave now."

942
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:08,360
At the airport, Leamas bought a newspaper.

943
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:16,370
He found an article about himself, and he
wondered whether Liz had seen it.

944
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:19,190
CHAPTER EIGHT
Alec's friend

945
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:25,210
Liz was very sad after Alec disappeared.

946
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:30,670
Of course, she heard about him hitting the
grocer and going to prison.

947
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:35,400
The members of her Communist Party Branch
talked about it at a meeting, though they

948
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,200
did not know about her and Alec.

949
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:42,450
"He knew he was going to do it," she thought.

950
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:47,310
"He knew it when he said goodbye to me.

951
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,820
But why?"

952
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:54,310
Once, she went to his flat and talked to his
landlord.

953
01:10:54,310 --> 01:11:01,310
She did not know why she did it, but the landlord
spoke kindly about Alec, so she was pleased

954
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:03,480
she had gone.

955
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:09,700
He told her that a friend of Mr Leamas, a
small, shy man with glasses, had come to see

956
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,320
him.

957
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:16,770
The friend said that Mr Leamas had asked him
to pay all his rent.

958
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:22,040
Mr Leamas was a strange man, the landlord
said, but it was very good of him to send

959
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:26,070
his friend to do that.

960
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:32,330
She continued to work at the library and thought
about Alec all the time.

961
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:36,219
Then a man came to see her at her flat.

962
01:11:36,219 --> 01:11:41,250
He was a short man who wore glasses and an
expensive suit.

963
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:44,960
She thought he must be Alec's friend.

964
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,960
The man said that he came from the police,
from Special Branch.

965
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,469
Then he asked her about Alec.

966
01:11:52,469 --> 01:12:00,190
"I believe you were friendly with Alec Leamas,"
he said, worriedly.

967
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:05,130
He looked kind, and Liz trusted him without
knowing why.

968
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:07,610
So she answered him honestly.

969
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:10,550
"Yes," she said.

970
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,920
"How did you know?"

971
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:17,360
"Oh, we found out by chance," he replied.

972
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:23,830
"When you go to prison, you have to give the
names of your family, or the people closest

973
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:25,540
to you.

974
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:29,860
Then they can be informed if anything happens
to you.

975
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:32,970
And Alec gave your name."

976
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:35,710
"I see."

977
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:38,380
Liz was surprised and confused.

978
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:43,400
"Did anyone know that you were friendly with
Alec?"

979
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,570
the small man went on.

980
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,860
"No."

981
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:51,960
"Did you go to the trial after he hit the
grocer?"

982
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,480
"No."

983
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:59,270
"Did any people from the newspapers call you?"
he asked.

984
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:02,739
"No, I've told you," said Liz.

985
01:13:02,739 --> 01:13:04,840
"No one knew.

986
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:08,570
Not even my parents."

987
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:18,980
The small man thought for a moment, then asked,
"Were you surprised when Alec hit the grocer?"

988
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:24,250
Liz wondered if she was talking too much to
him, but she wanted to talk to someone about

989
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,250
it.

990
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:27,469
It did not matter now.

991
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:31,670
"Yes, I was surprised," she said.

992
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:35,310
"But I think he knew that he was going to
do it."

993
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:38,100
"What do you mean?"

994
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,840
the man asked, quickly.

995
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:47,420
"Well, the night before he did it, we had
supper together," she replied.

996
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:53,670
"It was a special meal, and I asked him, 'Is
this goodbye?'"

997
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:57,960
"What did he say?" said the small man.

998
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:02,880
"He said that he had something that he must
do.

999
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:08,590
I didn't really understand," Liz said.

1000
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:15,500
There was a very long silence, and the small
man looked more worried than ever.

1001
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:21,340
Liz suddenly felt terrified for Alec, and
she did not know why.

1002
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:28,510
"Why do you think he asked people to inform
you if anything happened to him?"

1003
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:31,150
the man asked.

1004
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:32,940
Liz felt her face turn red.

1005
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:38,330
"I was in love with him," she replied.

1006
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:42,050
"Please don't ask any more questions.

1007
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:45,730
Please go now."

1008
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:51,690
The small man got up to go, then took out
a card from his pocket and put it gently on

1009
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:53,020
the table.

1010
01:14:53,020 --> 01:15:01,230
"If you ever want any help or if anything
happens about Alec, ring me," he said.

1011
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,910
"Do you understand?"

1012
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:08,450
"Who are you?" asked Liz.

1013
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:12,489
"I'm Alec's friend," he replied.

1014
01:15:12,489 --> 01:15:16,430
"Oh... just one more question.

1015
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:20,660
Did Alec know that you are a member of the
Communist Party?"

1016
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:25,530
"Yes, I told him," she replied.

1017
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:30,730
"Does the Party know about you and Alec?"
he asked.

1018
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:33,710
"No, I told you!"

1019
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:34,710
she shouted.

1020
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:37,670
"No one knew."

1021
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:43,590
Then suddenly she cried out, "Where is he?

1022
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:44,630
Tell me where he is!

1023
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:46,410
I can help him.

1024
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:49,370
I can look after him."

1025
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:55,170
"He's abroad," replied the small man, quietly.

1026
01:15:55,170 --> 01:16:00,630
"I'm sorry that he told you that he had something
special to do."

1027
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:04,420
"Who are you?"

1028
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:06,240
she asked again.

1029
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:10,380
"I'm Alec's friend," he repeated.

1030
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:12,690
"Don't worry.

1031
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:20,070
We'll look after you - with money and that
kind of thing."

1032
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:25,640
He went out of the door, and she heard a car
start in the street.

1033
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:30,340
Then she remembered the card and picked it
up off the table.

1034
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:35,010
There was only a name, address and telephone
number on it.

1035
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:45,230
There was nothing to say what his job was:
'Mr George Smiley, 9 Bywater Street, Chelsea'.

1036
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:51,070
It was very strange.

1037
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:56,330
CHAPTER NINE
To the East

1038
01:16:56,330 --> 01:17:03,170
Leamas sat on the plane to West Berlin and
wondered again, why things had changed.

1039
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:07,950
Why had his defection been discovered so soon?

1040
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:14,460
Control knew, because Control had done this,
but Leamas did not know.

1041
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:20,110
He also remembered Control's advice when he
had stayed at his house for the weekend.

1042
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:22,900
"Get angry.

1043
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,620
Drink a lot.

1044
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:30,170
Confuse them by telling them that something
is true one day, then telling them that the

1045
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:34,230
same thing is not true the next day.

1046
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:38,150
Make them work hard to get your information.

1047
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:43,969
Make them believe they have worked out that
Mundt has betrayed their side to us.

1048
01:17:43,969 --> 01:17:50,130
They already have information that we gave
them before you became involved.

1049
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:56,970
You are taking them the last parts of the
story."

1050
01:17:56,970 --> 01:18:02,820
After the plane landed, Peters led Leamas
quickly through the airport to a big black

1051
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:07,090
car, which was waiting in a car park.

1052
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:13,990
After they got into it, a smaller car pulled
out of the same car park in front of them.

1053
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:19,800
Both cars moved quickly through the streets
of Berlin, and Leamas was surprised at how

1054
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:25,210
easily they crossed out of the West and into
the East.

1055
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:30,750
Leamas thought that they would stop in East
Berlin, but the car kept moving.

1056
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:35,660
"Where are we going?" he asked Peters.

1057
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:39,210
"We're here," replied Peters.

1058
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:43,690
"We are in the German Democratic Republic."

1059
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:49,290
"I thought we would go further east, to Russia,"
said Leamas.

1060
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:55,900
"The East Germans want to talk to you," said
Peters.

1061
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:59,430
Leamas nodded his head, and Peters continued.

1062
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:05,170
"I sent your information to them, and they
are interested in it.

1063
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:08,560
They've never talked to anyone with your knowledge
before."

1064
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,670
"Who will interrogate me?" asked Leamas.

1065
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:19,200
"I know the names of most of the people in
the East German secret service."

1066
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,940
"Who do you think that you will meet?"

1067
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:24,690
replied Peters.

1068
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:30,969
"Fiedler, who works for Mundt," said Leamas.

1069
01:19:30,969 --> 01:19:35,440
Leamas thought back to what he had learned
about Fiedler.

1070
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:42,070
Leamas remembered that Fiedler had lived in
Canada during the war, so he spoke good English.

1071
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:49,360
The photographs had shown a thin young man
with dark hair and intelligent brown eyes.

1072
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:56,010
He was a man who worked alone and whose colleagues
did not like or trust him.

1073
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:58,900
He remembered what Control had said.

1074
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:04,250
"Fiedler hates Mundt, and he is as clever
as Mundt.

1075
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:09,690
He'd like to get rid of Mundt, so he is the
person who is most useful to us.

1076
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:16,400
You will make him believe that Mundt is a
double agent, working for us.

1077
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:21,260
But you mustn't make it obvious."

1078
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:27,530
Finally, the car arrived at a farmhouse and
stopped outside it.

1079
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:33,210
By now, it was night, and in the light of
the moon, Leamas saw two men get out of the

1080
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:35,969
small car, which had also stopped.

1081
01:20:35,969 --> 01:20:41,750
He could also see a thin man sitting in the
back of it.

1082
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:48,840
Peters took Leamas into the old farmhouse,
which smelled like a place where nobody lived.

1083
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:55,010
He and Leamas sat down in a room with old,
dark-coloured furniture, and photos of Soviet

1084
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:57,400
leaders on the walls.

1085
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:05,820
After a few silent minutes, the door opened
and a short, thin man came in, carrying a

1086
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:09,340
bottle of whisky and two glasses.

1087
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:14,160
He was wearing a dark-blue suit that looked
too big for him.

1088
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,300
"Hello," he said to Leamas.

1089
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,500
"I'm Fiedler.

1090
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,590
I'm glad to see you.

1091
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:24,300
You've reached the end of your journey."

1092
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:29,300
"What do you mean?" asked Leamas, quickly.

1093
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:34,190
"I mean that you're not going any further
east.

1094
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:36,380
Sorry."

1095
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:39,110
Leamas remembered something Control had said.

1096
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:46,860
"Make them dislike you, and then they will
believe what you tell them more."

1097
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,710
So he pretended to be very angry.

1098
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:52,580
Leamas turned to Peters.

1099
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:57,450
"Is this true?" he shouted, angrily.

1100
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:59,390
"Tell me!"

1101
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:00,810
Peters nodded.

1102
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:02,230
"Yes.

1103
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:08,670
We - the Soviet secret service - agreed to
help our friends in the East German secret

1104
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:12,500
service and bring you here."

1105
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:18,630
Leamas shouted at Fiedler, "You knew I wouldn't
defect to a little, unimportant place like

1106
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:20,570
the GDR.

1107
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:23,130
That's why you sent a Russian!"

1108
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:29,010
"We had help from the Russians to take you
to Holland," said Fiedler.

1109
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:34,010
"In fact, we didn't want to bring you to East
Germany.

1110
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:39,270
But we didn't know that your colleagues in
Britain would find out about your defection

1111
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:41,560
so quickly.

1112
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:49,120
We had to do it because there are still things
that you haven't told us."

1113
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:55,190
Then Fiedler said something in Russian to
Peters, who nodded and stood up.

1114
01:22:55,190 --> 01:23:00,230
"Goodbye," Peters said to Leamas.

1115
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:04,650
Leamas did not answer.

1116
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:09,580
CHAPTER TEN
Details

1117
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:16,430
That night, Leamas slept in a small, bare
room with only a bed and a desk in it.

1118
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:21,840
To get to his room, he had to walk through
another room with two beds in it.

1119
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,770
Later, he realized that the two men who slept
there were guards.

1120
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:34,570
In fact, these guards were never far away
from him while he was in the farmhouse.

1121
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:41,550
The next morning, one of the guards brought
some bread and bad coffee for breakfast.

1122
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:45,960
Leamas looked out of the window while he was
having breakfast.

1123
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:52,170
The farmhouse was on the top of a high hill,
and, below it, Leamas could see hills covered

1124
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:53,740
with tall trees.

1125
01:23:53,740 --> 01:24:01,100
There were no houses, and a long way below
in a valley he could see the road.

1126
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:04,050
There was no sound.

1127
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:06,090
Fiedler came into the room.

1128
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:10,090
"Good morning," he said with a smile.

1129
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:14,270
"Finish your breakfast, and then we will talk."

1130
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:19,480
"I've told Peters everything that I know,"
replied Leamas.

1131
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:24,090
"Oh no you haven't," replied Fiedler.

1132
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:30,060
"You've only given us one piece of information
that we didn't know.

1133
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:34,190
I'm talking about Rolling Stone, of course.

1134
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:39,020
And I'm sure that you can tell us more."

1135
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:45,120
He took Leamas outside, and they went for
a walk down the road into the valley and then

1136
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,210
along a path through the forest.

1137
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:51,640
Fiedler asked lots of questions.

1138
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:56,770
He asked about the building in Cambridge Circus
in London and about the people who worked

1139
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:58,550
there.

1140
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:02,730
He asked about their families and where they
lived.

1141
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:08,050
Most of all, he wanted to know about why they
worked for the Circus.

1142
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:10,480
"What do they believe in?

1143
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,360
What is their philosophy?" he asked.

1144
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:17,900
"I don't know," said Leamas.

1145
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,090
"They don't believe in anything.

1146
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:22,160
They're just people."

1147
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:28,310
"What makes them do these jobs, then?" asked
Fiedler.

1148
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:30,020
He sounded confused.

1149
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:34,030
"I don't know," said Leamas.

1150
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:37,850
Then he added, "I suppose they don't like
Communists."

1151
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:42,300
"I see," said Fiedler.

1152
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:47,260
"We kill people because we believe in something.

1153
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:53,480
It must be harder to kill people if you don't
have a philosophy that you believe in."

1154
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:56,750
"I don't know," replied Leamas.

1155
01:25:56,750 --> 01:26:00,130
"And I don't care."

1156
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:04,050
He suddenly sounded tired.

1157
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:10,020
They stopped while Fiedler gave Leamas a cigarette
and lit it for him.

1158
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:15,880
About an hour after they had left the farmhouse,
they reached the top of a hill.

1159
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:20,230
Looking back, Leamas could see the farmhouse
across the valley.

1160
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:22,690
He was enjoying the walk.

1161
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:30,500
"We'll sit down for a moment," said Fiedler,
"and then we must go back.

1162
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:33,210
Tell me more about Rolling Stone.

1163
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:39,690
Large amounts of money were deposited in banks
in Copenhagen and Helsinki.

1164
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:43,880
What did you think they were for?"

1165
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:47,390
"I told Peters," replied Leamas.

1166
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:51,550
"They were payments to an agent, probably
behind the Iron Curtain."

1167
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:55,480
"Why did you think so?"

1168
01:26:55,480 --> 01:27:02,150
"Well, they were very big payments, and it
was very difficult to make them," replied

1169
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:03,150
Leamas.

1170
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:07,310
"And, of course, Control was involved, too."

1171
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:12,850
"What do you think that the agent did with
the money?" asked Fiedler.

1172
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:16,160
"I don't know," said Leamas.

1173
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:19,150
"I don't even know if the money was collected.

1174
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:25,520
I just went to Denmark and Finland and deposited
the money in the banks, and then I came back."

1175
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:34,489
"What names did you use, and when did you
go to each country?" asked Fiedler.

1176
01:27:34,489 --> 01:27:38,540
"In Copenhagen, I was Robert Lang.

1177
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:40,980
And in Helsinki, I was Stephen Bennett."

1178
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:47,920
"And when did you go to each country?" asked
Fiedler.

1179
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:57,310
"I went to Denmark on 15th June of this year
and to Finland on 24th September," replied

1180
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:58,320
Leamas.

1181
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:02,020
"Did the banks ever write to you?"

1182
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:04,250
"I don't know.

1183
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:10,150
If they did, the letters went to Control,
I suppose," replied Leamas.

1184
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:18,730
"You didn't know much," said Fiedler, "so
it is possible that the Rolling Stone payments

1185
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:22,930
were to a double agent in the GDR."

1186
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,980
"No," said Leamas.

1187
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,600
"I told Peters.

1188
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,300
That's impossible.

1189
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:34,830
I was in charge, and I knew about all the
agents in East Berlin."

1190
01:28:34,830 --> 01:28:36,890
Fiedler did not reply.

1191
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:39,500
Instead, he went on.

1192
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:47,489
"You could help us to find out whether anyone
withdrew any of the money from those banks.

1193
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:54,510
You could write a letter to each of the banks
and ask for a current statement.

1194
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:57,570
We could send the letters from an address
in Switzerland."

1195
01:28:57,570 --> 01:29:02,590
"How would that help you?" asked Leamas.

1196
01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:09,021
"If the money was withdrawn, we will know
the date when the agent was there.

1197
01:29:09,021 --> 01:29:13,840
That might be useful," said Fiedler.

1198
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:18,070
"You're dreaming, Fiedler," replied Leamas.

1199
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:21,570
"You'll never find the person who the payments
were for.

1200
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:26,440
You don't even know if he's an East German."

1201
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:31,480
Fiedler looked out over the valley for a few
moments before he spoke again.

1202
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:40,260
"We know that Rolling Stone was an operation
against us," he said.

1203
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:44,320
Leamas realized that Control's plan was working.

1204
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,219
Fiedler believed in Rolling Stone.

1205
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:50,210
"All right," he said.

1206
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:55,030
"I'll send the letters."

1207
01:29:55,030 --> 01:30:00,239
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Two letters

1208
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:05,900
Leamas was still in bed the next morning when
Fiedler brought the letters for him to sign.

1209
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:11,250
They each came from a different hotel in Switzerland.

1210
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:14,260
Leamas read the first letter:

1211
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:15,750
To the Manager

1212
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:17,690
Royal Scandinavian Bank

1213
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:18,690
Copenhagen

1214
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:20,150
Dear Sir,

1215
01:30:20,150 --> 01:30:27,480
I have been travelling for a few weeks and
have not received any post from England.

1216
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:34,600
For this reason, I have not received your
reply to my letter of 3rd March asking for

1217
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:40,270
a current statement of my joint account with
Herr Karlsdorf.

1218
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:47,400
I don't want any more delay, so please could
you send a statement to me at this address:

1219
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:53,180
13 Avenue des Colombes Paris XII, France.

1220
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:57,110
I am sorry for this confusion.

1221
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:58,430
Yours faithfully,

1222
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:00,940
Robert Lang

1223
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:06,280
"I didn't send them a letter on 3rd March,"
Leamas said.

1224
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:10,050
"No, you didn't," replied Fiedler.

1225
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:18,949
"But if the bank thinks that you did, they
will be worried and will reply quickly."

1226
01:31:18,949 --> 01:31:24,500
The second letter was the same as the first
one except for the names.

1227
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:27,840
Leamas signed the names on both letters.

1228
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:32,510
Fiedler thanked him and told him that someone
would post the letters in Switzerland the

1229
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:34,900
next day.

1230
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:40,620
He expected to hear from his colleagues in
Paris about the replies in about a week.

1231
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:47,500
"So we can go for walks and drive around the
hills," said Fiedler.

1232
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:53,310
"And you can tell me more details about the
Circus."

1233
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:58,150
There were many more walks that week.

1234
01:31:58,150 --> 01:32:04,970
Both men were relaxed, and Leamas talked a
lot about his job and the Circus.

1235
01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:10,660
In the evenings, they ate together and talked
in front of a fire.

1236
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:16,960
The two men began to like each other and almost
to trust each other, although Fiedler did

1237
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:22,730
not understand why Leamas had wanted to defect.

1238
01:32:22,730 --> 01:32:28,500
Fiedler told Leamas that he had only been
to England once, when he was a child.

1239
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:32,370
"But," Fiedler said, "Mundt worked there.

1240
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:36,360
Did you know that he worked in London?"

1241
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:40,020
"Oh, yes," replied Leamas.

1242
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:43,960
"He killed two people while he was there.

1243
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:48,420
And he nearly killed my colleague, George
Smiley, too."

1244
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:54,969
"It was amazing that Mundt managed to escape,
wasn't it?" said Fiedler.

1245
01:32:54,969 --> 01:33:01,210
"I heard that they didn't really want to catch
him," replied Leamas.

1246
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:04,310
"What?" said Fiedler.

1247
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:10,460
"Someone told me that one of our people made
some big mistakes," replied Leamas.

1248
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:17,370
"It was better to let Mundt escape than to
let too many people find out about them."

1249
01:33:17,370 --> 01:33:24,040
"Did anyone suggest that there was another
reason why the Circus let Mundt escape?"

1250
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:29,880
"What do you mean?" asked Leamas.

1251
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:39,190
Fiedler did not reply then, but as the days
passed, he started to seem tense and worried.

1252
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:44,960
One day, when they were driving in the hills,
Fiedler made a long phone call from a phone

1253
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,940
box.

1254
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:50,870
Leamas wondered why he did not use a phone
in the farmhouse.

1255
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:57,130
Later, Fiedler said, "We must be careful.

1256
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:58,260
Both of us."

1257
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,260
"Why?

1258
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:04,320
What do you know?" asked Leamas, quickly.

1259
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:10,800
"You might have to look after yourself for
a while," Fiedler said.

1260
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,100
"But don't worry.

1261
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:17,260
Everything will be all right."

1262
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:22,190
He held Leamas's arm tightly and continued
speaking.

1263
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:26,510
"Mundt has never done an interrogation before.

1264
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:28,930
I've always done them.

1265
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:37,739
Mundt likes to kill people, not talk to them,
and I've often wondered why."

1266
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:41,080
His hand held Leamas's arm more tightly.

1267
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:45,070
"I've thought about it, Leamas.

1268
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:50,640
I think he killed British agents who might
know too much about him.

1269
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:56,980
I think Mundt is a double agent, working for
the Circus."

1270
01:34:56,980 --> 01:35:01,200
"You're crazy," said Leamas, angrily.

1271
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,880
"It's not true.

1272
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:06,130
I was in charge in Berlin.

1273
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:11,660
The Circus couldn't have an agent who I didn't
know about - not an agent who was the Head

1274
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:16,360
of Operations for the East German secret service."

1275
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:25,970
"That phone call," said Fiedler, "was about
the reply to your letter to the bank in Copenhagen.

1276
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:32,580
Someone withdrew all the money from the account
a week after you deposited it.

1277
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:40,449
It happened when Mundt was on a visit to Copenhagen."

1278
01:35:40,449 --> 01:35:44,610
In London, Liz had received a letter, too.

1279
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:48,970
It came from the organizers of the Communist
Party in Britain.

1280
01:35:48,970 --> 01:35:51,920
Dear Comrade,

1281
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:57,460
We have had an invitation from the Party in
the German Democratic Republic for some of

1282
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:01,710
our members to visit Party Branches there.

1283
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:07,020
There are going to be visits for members of
the Bayswater Branch to the Neuenhagen Branch

1284
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:14,219
in Leipzig We asked for names of people who
might be interested, and your name was given

1285
01:36:14,219 --> 01:36:16,000
to us.

1286
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,480
We are sure that you are the right Comrade
for this job.

1287
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:25,740
All costs will be paid by the Party in the
GDR.

1288
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:29,750
We are sure that you will want to accept this
invitation.

1289
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:33,670
The visit will happen at the end of this month.

1290
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:39,380
Members will travel alone because the visits
will happen at different times.

1291
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:44,850
Please let us know as soon as possible whether
you can accept, and we will let you have more

1292
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:48,840
information.

1293
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:53,250
Liz wondered who had given her name to the
organizers.

1294
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:59,330
Then she remembered a man who she had met
at a big meeting for all the London Branches.

1295
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:01,930
He had asked lots of questions.

1296
01:37:01,930 --> 01:37:06,760
"Ashe, that was his name," she thought.

1297
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:10,870
"Perhaps it was him."

1298
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:15,350
She felt excited because it was a trip abroad.

1299
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:20,820
After writing to accept the invitation, she
saw Smiley's card.

1300
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:30,040
She remembered him saying, "Did the Party
know about you and Alec?", and she smiled.

1301
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:36,370
The trip abroad would help her to forget about
Alec.

1302
01:37:36,370 --> 01:37:41,140
CHAPTER TWELVE
Arrest

1303
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:46,410
After their conversation in the car, Fiedler
and Leamas drove back to the farmhouse in

1304
01:37:46,410 --> 01:37:48,330
the dark.

1305
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:53,760
Fiedler parked the car at the side of the
house, and as they walked towards it, they

1306
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:57,390
saw three men standing near the front door.

1307
01:37:57,390 --> 01:38:00,830
"Fiedler, we want to talk to you.

1308
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:05,230
We're from Berlin," shouted one of them.

1309
01:38:05,230 --> 01:38:09,390
"What's going on?" said Fiedler.

1310
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:14,690
"Why aren't the lights on in the house?"

1311
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:18,480
Fiedler walked towards the men.

1312
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:24,090
Leamas could not see the guards who usually
stayed near him when he was at the house.

1313
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:28,340
He waited for a moment, then went inside.

1314
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:32,719
He could not switch the lights on because
they were controlled from a central point

1315
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:36,070
by an unseen hand.

1316
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:42,550
Slowly and carefully, he walked in the darkness
towards his bedroom.

1317
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:49,310
He walked into the guards' bedroom and realized
that they were not there either, and then

1318
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:54,030
suddenly the door behind him closed.

1319
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:57,340
The room was completely dark.

1320
01:38:57,340 --> 01:39:01,390
He smelled cigarette smoke from his own bedroom.

1321
01:39:01,390 --> 01:39:06,650
Then he heard the key turn in the lock of
the door behind him, and he knew that he could

1322
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:09,739
not escape.

1323
01:39:09,739 --> 01:39:12,140
Leamas remembered his training.

1324
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:17,260
He walked towards a chair that he knew was
in a corner of the room and kicked it into

1325
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:19,820
the centre of the room.

1326
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:25,449
The people in the room knew that he was there,
so he did not need to be quiet.

1327
01:39:25,449 --> 01:39:33,179
Counting his footsteps, he moved back from
the chair and stood in one corner.

1328
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:37,090
He knew where the chair was, but they did
not.

1329
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:42,500
"Why don't you come in then?" he said in German.

1330
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:45,300
"I'm here in the corner.

1331
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:48,500
Come and get me."

1332
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:50,940
There was no sound from the other room.

1333
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:53,820
"Come on then!"

1334
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,730
shouted Leamas.

1335
01:39:55,730 --> 01:39:58,610
"Are you scared?"

1336
01:39:58,610 --> 01:40:06,450
At last, he heard one person moving forwards
out of his bedroom, then another one.

1337
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:11,510
He heard the first one walk into the chair
and cry out in pain.

1338
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:14,390
This was what he was waiting for.

1339
01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:20,900
He moved forward, holding his left arm out
in front of him until he touched an arm.

1340
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:29,260
He hit it gently, twice, and a voice very
close to him whispered, "Hans, is that you?"

1341
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:34,390
"Be quiet," whispered Leamas.

1342
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:41,239
At the same time, he reached out, got hold
of the man's hair and pulled his head forward.

1343
01:40:41,239 --> 01:40:46,410
He hit him hard on the back of his neck, then
pulled him up again and hit the front of his

1344
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:47,410
neck.

1345
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:53,030
The man fell heavily to the floor and did
not move.

1346
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:59,570
Then suddenly the lights came on, and the
door behind Leamas opened, making Leamas turn

1347
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:02,390
round quickly.

1348
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:10,820
Something hit him on the back of his head,
and he fell to the floor.

1349
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:16,949
When Leamas woke, he was cold, and he could
feel blood on his face.

1350
01:41:16,949 --> 01:41:22,880
He was lying on a stone floor, and, when he
tried to move, terrible pain went through

1351
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,390
his body.

1352
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:30,770
His hands and feet were held together behind
his back by a chain.

1353
01:41:30,770 --> 01:41:37,710
Above him, there was a bright light, and he
was in a white, empty room.

1354
01:41:37,710 --> 01:41:40,850
He lay on the floor in pain for hours.

1355
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:49,830
At last, the door opened and Mundt came in,
followed by two guards.

1356
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:55,590
Leamas looked at Mundt and remembered George
Smiley telling him about Mundt's frightening

1357
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:57,929
eyes.

1358
01:41:57,929 --> 01:42:01,750
The two guards untied his arms and legs.

1359
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:07,410
He tried to stand, but they kicked him, so
he fell down again.

1360
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:14,070
Then they pulled him along a corridor to a
small room with a desk and two armchairs.

1361
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:19,810
Mundt sat at the desk, and the guards put
Leamas in an armchair where he sat with his

1362
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:21,310
eyes closed.

1363
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:28,300
"Give me a drink," whispered Leamas.

1364
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:32,170
Mundt gave him a glass of water from a bottle
on his desk.

1365
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:38,640
"Bring him something to eat," he said to the
guards.

1366
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:43,740
They quickly brought a cup of soup and some
pieces of sausage.

1367
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:47,820
Leamas ate and drank while they watched in
silence.

1368
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:51,280
"Where's Fiedler?"

1369
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:53,540
asked Leamas, finally.

1370
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:58,160
"He's been arrested," replied Mundt.

1371
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:01,910
"What for?" asked Leamas.

1372
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:07,820
"He's working for the enemies of the GDR,"
Mundt said.

1373
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:11,650
"I see," said Leamas.

1374
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:17,929
"You think Fiedler is working for the British
secret service, and that I'm here to help

1375
01:43:17,929 --> 01:43:19,469
him.

1376
01:43:19,469 --> 01:43:23,719
You think I'm here to make the East German
secret service believe you are an agent for

1377
01:43:23,719 --> 01:43:25,370
the British.

1378
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:28,160
So you've arrested us both."

1379
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:30,260
"That's right.

1380
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:35,740
You'll both be put on trial," replied Mundt.

1381
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:40,220
"You will also be put on trial for murder."

1382
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:44,340
"So the guard died, did he?"

1383
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:46,530
Leamas replied.

1384
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:48,949
Mundt nodded, and then he went on.

1385
01:43:48,949 --> 01:43:53,760
"You aren't really a defector, of course.

1386
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:59,140
As soon as I read Peters's report, I knew
why you were here.

1387
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:05,340
I knew that Fiedler would believe that I was
a double agent because he hates me and wants

1388
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:06,900
my job."

1389
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:12,420
"So you've won," said Leamas.

1390
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:14,620
"Yes," replied Mundt.

1391
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:21,800
"Fiedler sent a report to the Praesidium yesterday
that he didn't send to me.

1392
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:27,270
But I saw it, and I knew that he wanted to
arrest me."

1393
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:33,430
The pain all over Leamas's body was increasing.

1394
01:44:33,430 --> 01:44:38,929
Suddenly there was shouting, and the door
opened violently.

1395
01:44:38,929 --> 01:44:43,800
Leamas could not open his eyes because of
his pain, but he could feel that the room

1396
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:46,290
was full of people.

1397
01:44:46,290 --> 01:44:49,350
He did not know what was happening.

1398
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:56,710
Suddenly, there was silence, and then someone
picked him up gently and carried him out of

1399
01:44:56,710 --> 01:44:59,620
the room.

1400
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:10,070
When he woke again, he was in a hospital bed,
and standing beside it was Fiedler.

1401
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:15,640
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Branch Meeting

1402
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:20,920
Leamas looked around the quiet hospital room
and then at Fiedler, who was calmly smoking

1403
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:21,969
a cigarette.

1404
01:45:21,969 --> 01:45:27,530
"How do you feel?" asked Fiedler.

1405
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:30,650
"Awful," replied Leamas.

1406
01:45:30,650 --> 01:45:34,090
"They beat me up, you know."

1407
01:45:34,090 --> 01:45:36,190
"Yes," said Fiedler.

1408
01:45:36,190 --> 01:45:39,090
"And you killed a guard."

1409
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:45,949
"I guessed that I had," said Leamas, "but
I had to protect myself.

1410
01:45:45,949 --> 01:45:47,540
What happened to you?"

1411
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:53,160
"Oh, Mundt's men beat me up, too," replied
Fiedler.

1412
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:59,989
"And he interrogated me as well, but I knew
that he would lose."

1413
01:45:59,989 --> 01:46:01,060
"Why?"

1414
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:03,199
asked Leamas.

1415
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:08,640
"I had collected evidence against him," he
replied.

1416
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:15,400
"Then you brought me the last piece of evidence
that I needed - about the payments.

1417
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:19,050
I put it all in my report to the Praesidium.

1418
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:26,499
So while he and his men were beating us up,
the members of the Praesidium were setting

1419
01:46:26,499 --> 01:46:27,499
up a Tribunal."

1420
01:46:27,499 --> 01:46:31,900
"What's that?" asked Leamas.

1421
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:36,060
"It's a secret trial," said Fiedler.

1422
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:39,650
"It will happen tomorrow.

1423
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:47,100
Mundt has been arrested, and you will give
evidence against him."

1424
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:53,199
Then a nurse brought Leamas some food, which
he ate, although he still felt awful.

1425
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:56,090
Fiedler watched him without speaking.

1426
01:46:56,090 --> 01:46:59,140
"What will happen in the Tribunal?"

1427
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:00,910
asked Leamas.

1428
01:47:00,910 --> 01:47:04,199
"There are three judges.

1429
01:47:04,199 --> 01:47:09,540
One of them - the President - is in charge
of the others," Fiedler said.

1430
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:16,400
"I will put the case against Mundt, and a
clever man called Karden will defend him."

1431
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:21,420
"Why can't Mundt defend himself?"

1432
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:22,890
Leamas asked.

1433
01:47:22,890 --> 01:47:26,410
"Mundt has asked for Karden to do it.

1434
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:32,450
I have been told that Karden will call a witness."

1435
01:47:32,450 --> 01:47:36,450
They sat in silence again, and then Fiedler
spoke.

1436
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:40,810
"You must get some sleep," he said.

1437
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:46,250
"Tomorrow, you can talk."

1438
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:49,340
Leamas went to sleep feeling pleased.

1439
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:54,730
He was pleased that Fiedler was on his side
against Mundt, even though Fiedler was really

1440
01:47:54,730 --> 01:47:59,510
on the other side - against the British secret
service.

1441
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:06,880
And tomorrow, Mundt would receive a sentence
of death.

1442
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:13,280
At the same time, Liz was in Leipzig, where
she had been for a few days.

1443
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:19,400
She was staying with a kind woman called Comrade
Ebert, who was the secretary of the Communist

1444
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:22,730
Party's Neuenhagen Branch.

1445
01:48:22,730 --> 01:48:27,730
Liz knew some German, so she could talk a
little to people.

1446
01:48:27,730 --> 01:48:33,170
She helped with work, giving books to people
about the Party and visiting members who had

1447
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:36,630
not been to meetings recently.

1448
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:40,830
The Branch Meeting was on the fourth evening
of her visit.

1449
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:47,630
There was going to be a discussion about "Working
and living together after two wars", and Comrade

1450
01:48:47,630 --> 01:48:52,410
Ebert told Liz that a lot of people would
come.

1451
01:48:52,410 --> 01:48:58,170
It was hard to make people come to the Branch
Meetings in London, so Liz wanted to get ideas

1452
01:48:58,170 --> 01:49:00,160
to take home.

1453
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:04,960
She was pleased that the meeting room was
better than the one in London.

1454
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:10,520
But then only seven people came, and Liz was
very upset.

1455
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:17,021
Liz was waiting for Comrade Ebert to put on
her coat after the end of the meeting, when

1456
01:49:17,021 --> 01:49:19,270
a man opened the door.

1457
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:23,500
"Comrade Ebert?" he asked.

1458
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:26,969
"Yes," Comrade Ebert replied.

1459
01:49:26,969 --> 01:49:31,460
"I'm looking for an English comrade," he continued.

1460
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:34,740
"She is staying with you - Comrade Gold."

1461
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:39,650
"I'm Elizabeth Gold," said Liz.

1462
01:49:39,650 --> 01:49:41,929
"My name is Holten.

1463
01:49:41,929 --> 01:49:45,679
I'm from the Party," he said.

1464
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:51,350
He showed some papers to Comrade Ebert, who
looked at them and nodded.

1465
01:49:51,350 --> 01:49:54,030
Then she looked at Liz a bit nervously.

1466
01:49:54,030 --> 01:49:59,340
"I have a message for Comrade Gold," Holten
said.

1467
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:04,469
"You are invited to a special meeting of the
Praesidium."

1468
01:50:04,469 --> 01:50:10,270
"Oh!" said Liz, wondering how the Praesidium
knew about her.

1469
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:14,180
"We must leave tonight," he said.

1470
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:16,699
"We have a long way to go.

1471
01:50:16,699 --> 01:50:18,120
To Gorlitz."

1472
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:21,930
"Where's that?" asked Liz.

1473
01:50:21,930 --> 01:50:28,010
"It's to the east, near Poland," replied Comrade
Ebert.

1474
01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:31,930
Liz felt confused.

1475
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:36,360
She was pleased that the Party thought she
was important enough to invite to a special

1476
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:40,840
meeting, but she was also surprised.

1477
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:46,360
She wondered why they were going to travel
so far to the east, but she did not feel she

1478
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:49,960
could ask any questions.

1479
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:58,290
Holten said, "We can collect your things,
and then we can continue the journey immediately."

1480
01:50:58,290 --> 01:51:02,200
Liz realized that she had to do what he said.

1481
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:07,110
She followed Holten to a black car with a
flag on the front.

1482
01:51:07,110 --> 01:51:16,670
As soon as she and Holten got in, the driver
started the engine and drove away.

1483
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:22,179
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
The Tribunal

1484
01:51:22,179 --> 01:51:27,929
The courtroom was painted white and was about
the same size as a school classroom.

1485
01:51:27,929 --> 01:51:35,550
At one end, guards and members of the Praesidium
sat on wooden benches.

1486
01:51:35,550 --> 01:51:41,810
At the other end, Leamas could see the three
judges, two men and a woman, sitting at a

1487
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:44,490
big table.

1488
01:51:44,490 --> 01:51:51,440
In front of the table, there were two men
sitting on wooden chairs opposite each other.

1489
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:56,360
There was a man in a dark suit who was about
sixty years old.

1490
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:59,640
This must be Karden, thought Leamas.

1491
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:03,180
The other man was Fiedler.

1492
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:07,820
Leamas sat at the back of the room with a
guard on each side of him.

1493
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:13,580
He could see Mundt sitting on a bench a few
rows in front of him, with policemen all round

1494
01:52:13,580 --> 01:52:16,470
him.

1495
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:22,030
Suddenly the middle one of the three Tribunal
members stood up.

1496
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:26,880
She was a small woman in her fifties, with
short dark hair.

1497
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:32,530
She nodded at a guard to close the door and
began to speak.

1498
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:37,390
"I am the President of this Tribunal.

1499
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:40,770
You all know why we are here.

1500
01:52:40,770 --> 01:52:47,330
This is a Tribunal that the Praesidium has
asked for, and you must remember that what

1501
01:52:47,330 --> 01:52:51,960
happens here is secret."

1502
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:54,210
Then she pointed at Fiedler.

1503
01:52:54,210 --> 01:53:00,840
"Comrade Fiedler, you can begin."

1504
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:07,860
Fiedler stood up, took some papers from a
small bag and began to speak.

1505
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:13,370
Leamas thought he talked well - he sounded
both serious and confident.

1506
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:20,800
"The case against Comrade Mundt is that he
is an agent working for the British secret

1507
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:26,850
service who has given them information," said
Fiedler.

1508
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:33,610
"Also, he has received large payments from
the British secret service for that information.

1509
01:53:33,610 --> 01:53:43,340
There is no worse crime than this one, and
his sentence has to be a death sentence.

1510
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:51,530
"Comrade Mundt is forty-two years old and
is Head of Operations for the secret service

1511
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:54,260
of the GDR.

1512
01:53:54,260 --> 01:54:01,900
He was recruited when he was twenty-eight
and for many years did special work in Scandinavia

1513
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:09,780
- in Norway, Sweden and Finland - so he was
able to travel easily to this part of the

1514
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:11,550
world.

1515
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:18,429
He was good at his job, recruiting agents
who worked for us in the West.

1516
01:54:18,429 --> 01:54:29,000
But he became greedy for money, and this is
why he has betrayed his country and his people.

1517
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:37,820
We have caught him because of his greed for
large amounts of money."

1518
01:54:37,820 --> 01:54:40,830
Fiedler now looked down at his papers.

1519
01:54:40,830 --> 01:54:51,680
"At the end of 1956, Mundt was sent to London
to work," he said, "but at the end of his

1520
01:54:51,680 --> 01:55:00,679
time there in the early 1960s, there were
problems and two people died.

1521
01:55:00,679 --> 01:55:04,659
The British wanted to arrest Mundt.

1522
01:55:04,659 --> 01:55:08,970
Then he disappeared for two days.

1523
01:55:08,970 --> 01:55:19,550
Surprisingly, after those two days, he took
a taxi to a London airport and flew to Berlin.

1524
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:25,820
The British police were searching for him,
but he was able to leave the country easily

1525
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:31,390
because the British secret service had recruited
him.

1526
01:55:31,390 --> 01:55:38,909
I believe that they had told him that they
would send him to prison for many years, or

1527
01:55:38,909 --> 01:55:42,460
he could work as an agent for them.

1528
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:49,850
"If he worked for them, he could return to
his country and receive large payments for

1529
01:55:49,850 --> 01:55:54,100
the information that he gave them."

1530
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:59,540
Fiedler paused and looked round the room,
then continued.

1531
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:07,050
"We received information some time ago about
the large amount of special knowledge that

1532
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:11,659
the British secret service had about the GDR.

1533
01:56:11,659 --> 01:56:19,070
I cannot tell you where that information came
from, but it made us believe that someone

1534
01:56:19,070 --> 01:56:23,690
in our secret service was giving it to them.

1535
01:56:23,690 --> 01:56:31,950
It had to be someone with an important job,
but we were not sure who it was.

1536
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:39,489
I wondered if it was Mundt, but it seemed
amazing that our own Head of Operations could

1537
01:56:39,489 --> 01:56:40,840
do this.

1538
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:47,920
But then the final evidence was brought to
us."

1539
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:50,640
He turned to the back of the room.

1540
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:56,260
"Bring Leamas forward," he said.

1541
01:56:56,260 --> 01:57:01,320
The guards on either side of Leamas stood
up and led him forward.

1542
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:06,450
They made him stand in front of the table
between Fiedler and Karden.

1543
01:57:06,450 --> 01:57:08,830
The President spoke to him.

1544
01:57:08,830 --> 01:57:11,679
"What is your name?"

1545
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:12,780
she asked.

1546
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:14,480
"Alec Leamas."

1547
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:17,770
"What is your age?"

1548
01:57:17,770 --> 01:57:19,100
she continued.

1549
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:20,370
"Fifty."

1550
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:23,360
"What is your job?"

1551
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:27,690
"I work in a library," replied Leamas.

1552
01:57:27,690 --> 01:57:30,350
This reply made Fiedler angry.

1553
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:36,340
"You worked for the British secret service,
didn't you?" he said.

1554
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:40,570
"Yes, that's right," said Leamas.

1555
01:57:40,570 --> 01:57:48,360
"You can see from my report," Fiedler went
on, speaking to everyone in the room, "that

1556
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:53,449
Leamas is a defector from the British secret
service.

1557
01:57:53,449 --> 01:57:58,870
But you will hear suggestions that he is not
a defector at all.

1558
01:57:58,870 --> 01:58:05,830
"Herr Karden will defend Mundt by saying that
Leamas was sent by the British secret service

1559
01:58:05,830 --> 01:58:09,680
to make us think that Mundt is a traitor.

1560
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:13,600
But this is not true.

1561
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:20,900
We found Leamas, persuaded him to defect and
brought him to the GDR.

1562
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:28,080
Leamas was in charge of the East German agents
for the British in Berlin, and he does not

1563
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:32,160
believe that Mundt is a double agent.

1564
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:42,420
But he has given us evidence that helps us
to prove that Mundt is a traitor."

1565
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:50,520
Leamas remembered Control's words again: "Give
them your information, and let them work out

1566
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:52,840
what to think."

1567
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:56,260
He had done this to Fiedler.

1568
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:58,790
Then Fiedler spoke to Leamas.

1569
01:58:58,790 --> 01:59:05,739
"The Tribunal has read all the reports of
your interrogation," he said.

1570
01:59:05,739 --> 01:59:13,500
"But I want you to tell them yourself about
the operation called Rolling Stone."

1571
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:16,429
He turned to the judges.

1572
01:59:16,429 --> 01:59:23,949
"You have copies of the letters that I will
mention," he said.

1573
01:59:23,949 --> 01:59:29,679
Fiedler asked Leamas the same questions that
he had asked him before, and Leamas talked

1574
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:36,489
about the bank accounts in Helsinki and in
Copenhagen that he had put money in.

1575
01:59:36,489 --> 01:59:41,719
Fiedler then explained about the letters that
had been sent recently from Leamas to these

1576
01:59:41,719 --> 01:59:42,860
banks.

1577
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:48,030
"We haven't had a reply from Helsinki," he
said.

1578
01:59:48,030 --> 01:59:53,200
"But we have had a reply from Copenhagen.

1579
01:59:53,200 --> 02:00:02,400
Leamas deposited ten thousand dollars on 15th
June this year, and this money was taken out

1580
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:06,900
of the account one week later.

1581
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:13,710
Comrade Mundt was in the city for a few days
at that time.

1582
02:00:13,710 --> 02:00:23,650
"Leamas visited Helsinki on 24th September
and deposited forty thousand dollars.

1583
02:00:23,650 --> 02:00:32,650
Comrade Mundt was in the city for a few days
at that time."

1584
02:00:32,650 --> 02:00:34,920
There was silence.

1585
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:42,590
Then Fiedler continued, "We can also prove
that Comrade Mundt arranged the murders of

1586
02:00:42,590 --> 02:00:50,790
a number of East German double agents so that
they did not discover that he was also a British

1587
02:00:50,790 --> 02:00:53,340
agent.

1588
02:00:53,340 --> 02:01:01,080
Karl Riemeck was different - he was an agent
who worked for Mundt and knew that Mundt worked

1589
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:02,860
for the British.

1590
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:15,100
So Riemeck was a danger to Mundt when I started
to suspect that Mundt was a double agent.

1591
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:22,370
Mundt told Riemeck to escape because he was
in danger, then gave an order to the guards

1592
02:01:22,370 --> 02:01:26,000
at the checkpoint to shoot him.

1593
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:34,179
Later, he killed Riemeck's woman because Riemeck
used to talk to her too much about his secret

1594
02:01:34,179 --> 02:01:37,340
work."

1595
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:39,870
No one spoke.

1596
02:01:39,870 --> 02:01:43,150
Everyone was looking from Fiedler to Mundt.

1597
02:01:43,150 --> 02:01:54,850
"This is a greedy, violent man who has betrayed
his country and its people," said Fiedler.

1598
02:01:54,850 --> 02:02:06,739
"For Hans-Dieter Mundt, the only sentence
is a death sentence."

1599
02:02:06,739 --> 02:02:11,510
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Confession

1600
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:17,090
The President of the Tribunal turned to the
man in the black suit sitting opposite Fiedler.

1601
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:24,680
"Comrade Karden," she said, "do you want to
talk to the witness, Leamas?"

1602
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:32,070
"Yes, yes, I would like to do that," Karden
said, standing up slowly.

1603
02:02:32,070 --> 02:02:36,170
He put on his glasses, and then he started
to speak.

1604
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:41,540
"Comrade Mundt believes that Leamas is lying.

1605
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:48,900
We know that Karl Riemeck was a traitor, a
British spy, but Mundt was not.

1606
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:53,680
He did not accept money for betraying our
Party.

1607
02:02:53,680 --> 02:03:01,130
We say that there is no real evidence that
he did, but there is evidence that Leamas

1608
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:04,960
is part of a British plan.

1609
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:11,739
Leamas has involved Comrade Fiedler in this
plan to make us think that Comrade Mundt is

1610
02:03:11,739 --> 02:03:14,550
a traitor."

1611
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:17,429
The man spoke gently and politely.

1612
02:03:17,429 --> 02:03:25,659
"We say that Leamas pretended to go downhill
and to drink too much so that he had to leave

1613
02:03:25,659 --> 02:03:28,490
his job with the Circus.

1614
02:03:28,490 --> 02:03:31,700
He pretended to hate his employers.

1615
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:38,260
And he hit a shopkeeper so that he was arrested
and went to prison.

1616
02:03:38,260 --> 02:03:45,179
All these things happened to make us think
that he was a man who would like to defect

1617
02:03:45,179 --> 02:03:48,550
and betray his country.

1618
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:55,710
He planned to say that Mundt was not a traitor,
but he gave us evidence that suggested that

1619
02:03:55,710 --> 02:03:57,880
he was.

1620
02:03:57,880 --> 02:04:02,370
It was a clever plan."

1621
02:04:02,370 --> 02:04:05,409
Karden went on in the same polite voice.

1622
02:04:05,409 --> 02:04:13,030
"We say that the information that Leamas gave
to Fiedler, about payments into bank accounts

1623
02:04:13,030 --> 02:04:15,929
for Mundt, is false.

1624
02:04:15,929 --> 02:04:23,909
"The British knew that Fiedler hated Mundt
and wanted his job, so they knew that he would

1625
02:04:23,909 --> 02:04:27,920
help their plan by believing Leamas.

1626
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:35,850
But for months, Mundt has known that Fiedler
wants to get rid of him, and he has been very

1627
02:04:35,850 --> 02:04:38,160
careful.

1628
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:44,260
It was Mundt who planned our first approach
to Leamas in England.

1629
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:50,900
And when Leamas was first interrogated, Mundt
saw the reports.

1630
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:59,179
He saw what Leamas had said about the dates
of his visits to banks in Denmark and Finland.

1631
02:04:59,179 --> 02:05:05,250
Then he was certain that there was a British
operation to get rid of him.

1632
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:12,370
"Comrade Mundt then began to check on Leamas's
life before his defection.

1633
02:05:12,370 --> 02:05:21,010
He was looking for a mistake in the plan,
and he found one - a very simple one.

1634
02:05:21,010 --> 02:05:23,180
And he found a witness.

1635
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:30,410
But before we talk to the witness, let me
ask Mr Leamas a few questions.

1636
02:05:30,410 --> 02:05:36,310
"Tell me," said Karden, "do you have much
money?"

1637
02:05:36,310 --> 02:05:40,850
"Of course not," replied Leamas, angrily.

1638
02:05:40,850 --> 02:05:44,170
"I wouldn't be here if I had plenty of money."

1639
02:05:44,170 --> 02:05:51,800
"Is there someone in England who would lend
you money or pay your bills for you?"

1640
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:54,620
"No," said Leamas.

1641
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:57,680
"Thank you," said Karden.

1642
02:05:57,680 --> 02:06:00,949
"Here's another question.

1643
02:06:00,949 --> 02:06:03,870
Do you know George Smiley?"

1644
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:07,409
"Yes, of course," replied Leamas.

1645
02:06:07,409 --> 02:06:09,300
"He was in the Circus.

1646
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:11,989
He left it before I did."

1647
02:06:11,989 --> 02:06:19,520
"Have you seen him since you left the Circus?"
asked Karden.

1648
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:26,630
Leamas paused before he answered because he
was not sure why Karden was asking these questions.

1649
02:06:26,630 --> 02:06:30,969
At last, he said, "No."

1650
02:06:30,969 --> 02:06:38,230
"And was Smiley interested in you after you
left the Circus?"

1651
02:06:38,230 --> 02:06:39,530
Karden asked.

1652
02:06:39,530 --> 02:06:43,900
"No, of course not," replied Leamas.

1653
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:52,750
"And tell me, when you hit the grocer, how
much money did you have?"

1654
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:55,330
"Nothing," said Leamas.

1655
02:06:55,330 --> 02:06:59,630
"I'd been ill for a week and hadn't eaten
anything.

1656
02:06:59,630 --> 02:07:02,130
That's when I decided to defect and-"

1657
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:03,900
Karden interrupted him.

1658
02:07:03,900 --> 02:07:10,470
"You were owed money by the library, of course,
weren't you?"

1659
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:17,030
"How did you know that?" asked Leamas, suddenly
worried.

1660
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:18,920
Karden did not answer.

1661
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:21,160
"Thank you.

1662
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:25,590
You can sit down," he said.

1663
02:07:25,590 --> 02:07:29,679
Then the guards took Leamas back to his seat
on the bench.

1664
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:37,030
The door opened and a large, ugly woman in
a grey uniform came in.

1665
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:40,429
Behind her was Liz.

1666
02:07:40,429 --> 02:07:45,620
She came slowly into the courtroom, looking
around her.

1667
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:49,010
Leamas had forgotten how young she was.

1668
02:07:49,010 --> 02:07:53,300
When she saw him between the two guards, she
stopped.

1669
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:54,699
"Alec!"

1670
02:07:54,699 --> 02:07:56,670
she said.

1671
02:07:56,670 --> 02:08:01,929
One of the guards put his hand on her arm
and led her to where Leamas had stood in front

1672
02:08:01,929 --> 02:08:03,630
of the big table.

1673
02:08:03,630 --> 02:08:10,699
"What is your name, child?" asked the President.

1674
02:08:10,699 --> 02:08:11,760
"Elizabeth Gold."

1675
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:16,420
"You are a member of the British Communist
Party?"

1676
02:08:16,420 --> 02:08:20,400
"Yes," replied Liz.

1677
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:25,760
Suddenly there was the noise of furniture
falling over on the floor and the sound of

1678
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:32,940
Leamas's voice, ugly and loud, shouting, "Leave
her alone!

1679
02:08:32,940 --> 02:08:35,340
Leave her alone!"

1680
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:42,370
Liz turned round and was terrified when she
saw a guard hit Leamas hard on his jaw.

1681
02:08:42,370 --> 02:08:48,470
Two other men got hold of his arms and pulled
them behind his back.

1682
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:53,380
Liz saw that his face was white and there
was blood on his jaw.

1683
02:08:53,380 --> 02:08:55,900
Then his head fell forward.

1684
02:08:55,900 --> 02:09:03,429
"If he moves again, take him out of the room,"
said the President.

1685
02:09:03,429 --> 02:09:05,430
Then she spoke to Liz again.

1686
02:09:05,430 --> 02:09:13,600
"You know the rule that you must not ask another
Comrade for details of what the Party does,

1687
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:14,740
don't you?"

1688
02:09:14,740 --> 02:09:17,040
Liz nodded.

1689
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:22,270
"Yes, of course," she said, quietly.

1690
02:09:22,270 --> 02:09:26,489
"Today you must remember that rule.

1691
02:09:26,489 --> 02:09:30,760
It is better that you don't know any details.

1692
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:35,510
We are members of the Party who work for the
Praesidium.

1693
02:09:35,510 --> 02:09:41,429
We are going to ask you some questions, which
you must answer.

1694
02:09:41,429 --> 02:09:47,800
It is important that you speak the truth when
you answer them," said the President.

1695
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:51,650
"But who is on trial?"

1696
02:09:51,650 --> 02:09:53,140
Liz whispered.

1697
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:55,640
"Is it Alec?"

1698
02:09:55,640 --> 02:10:01,340
"I have told you that it is better you don't
know anything.

1699
02:10:01,340 --> 02:10:06,120
Then you can go home," replied the President.

1700
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:11,260
"This man is going to ask you some questions."

1701
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:18,320
The President pointed to Karden, who stood
up and spoke politely to Liz.

1702
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:23,580
"Alec Leamas was your lover, wasn't he?"

1703
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:25,610
Karden said.

1704
02:10:25,610 --> 02:10:26,870
Liz nodded.

1705
02:10:26,870 --> 02:10:31,430
"When did you see him last before today?"

1706
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:35,220
"At his flat," she replied.

1707
02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:37,000
"He was ill.

1708
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,420
I went to help him."

1709
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:46,159
"I suppose that cost you a lot of money,"
said Karden.

1710
02:10:46,159 --> 02:10:50,430
His voice sounded kind, but Liz did not trust
him.

1711
02:10:50,430 --> 02:10:55,460
"I got the money from Alec," she replied.

1712
02:10:55,460 --> 02:11:00,060
"Oh," said Karden, quickly, "so he did have
money!"

1713
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:05,090
"Oh, God, have I said something wrong?"

1714
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:06,650
thought Liz.

1715
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:08,420
She was becoming frightened.

1716
02:11:08,420 --> 02:11:14,139
She wanted to see Leamas's face so she could
guess what he wanted her to say.

1717
02:11:14,139 --> 02:11:16,550
But he was behind her.

1718
02:11:16,550 --> 02:11:20,580
"He didn't have much money," she said.

1719
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:26,000
"He couldn't pay his bills they were all paid
after he'd gone.

1720
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,240
A friend paid them."

1721
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:33,150
"Of course," said Karden in his kind voice.

1722
02:11:33,150 --> 02:11:38,500
"Did you ever meet this friend, Elizabeth?"

1723
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:40,030
She shook her head.

1724
02:11:40,030 --> 02:11:45,360
"I see," said Karden.

1725
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:48,960
There was a terrible silence in the courtroom.

1726
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:54,900
It was terrifying for Liz because she felt
like a blind person in a room full of people

1727
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:56,570
who could see.

1728
02:11:56,570 --> 02:12:02,390
They understood the meaning of her answers,
but she did not.

1729
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:08,590
"Do you earn much money, Elizabeth?" asked
Karden.

1730
02:12:08,590 --> 02:12:11,590
"No," she whispered.

1731
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:18,429
"It must be hard to pay the rent on your flat
every month," he said.

1732
02:12:18,429 --> 02:12:23,719
"Have you paid this month's rent?"

1733
02:12:23,719 --> 02:12:25,760
She shook her head again.

1734
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:29,320
"Why not?" asked Karden.

1735
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:34,120
"Don't you have any money?"

1736
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:40,920
In a whisper she replied, "Someone bought
the lease and gave me the flat.

1737
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:43,980
They sent it in the post."

1738
02:12:43,980 --> 02:12:45,390
"Who?"

1739
02:12:45,390 --> 02:12:49,639
"I don't know."

1740
02:12:49,639 --> 02:12:52,060
Liz was crying now.

1741
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:57,139
"Please don't ask any more questions."

1742
02:12:57,139 --> 02:13:03,370
But Karden did ask more questions as Liz sobbed
and sobbed.

1743
02:13:03,370 --> 02:13:05,900
No one in the courtroom moved.

1744
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:15,000
"Tell me," he asked, "did anyone come to see
you after Leamas went away?"

1745
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,270
"No," she said.

1746
02:13:18,270 --> 02:13:22,920
She knew that they were trying to hurt Alec,
and she did not want to give them any more

1747
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:24,370
information.

1748
02:13:24,370 --> 02:13:31,790
"But your neighbours have told us that a man
came to see you, Elizabeth," he continued.

1749
02:13:31,790 --> 02:13:33,639
"Who was he?"

1750
02:13:33,639 --> 02:13:36,409
"I don't know."

1751
02:13:36,409 --> 02:13:39,320
"Who was he?"

1752
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:40,970
Karden asked again.

1753
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:44,179
At last, Liz replied.

1754
02:13:44,179 --> 02:13:48,440
"His name was Smiley.

1755
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:52,280
He left his card with his name and address.

1756
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:58,620
He said to get in touch with him if I needed
any help."

1757
02:13:58,620 --> 02:14:05,100
There was complete silence in the court, and
then Karden spoke again, pointing towards

1758
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:06,330
Leamas.

1759
02:14:06,330 --> 02:14:14,750
"Leamas had done the one thing the British
secret service never expected him to do.

1760
02:14:14,750 --> 02:14:21,220
He had found a lover - like Riemeck did, in
fact.

1761
02:14:21,220 --> 02:14:27,710
Smiley wanted to know how much Leamas had
told the girl."

1762
02:14:27,710 --> 02:14:32,440
Then he turned again to Liz and started to
ask questions again.

1763
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:36,820
"Did you try to get in touch with Leamas?"

1764
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:38,159
"No!

1765
02:14:38,159 --> 02:14:39,550
He told me not to.

1766
02:14:39,550 --> 02:14:45,740
He made me promise not to follow him and never
to try to find him."

1767
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:52,690
"And the last time you saw him, did you say
goodbye?"

1768
02:14:52,690 --> 02:14:56,360
Looking very tired, Liz nodded.

1769
02:14:56,360 --> 02:15:02,679
"What reason did he give for leaving you?"
asked Karden.

1770
02:15:02,679 --> 02:15:05,030
His voice now sounded ugly.

1771
02:15:05,030 --> 02:15:08,810
"He didn't leave me," she said.

1772
02:15:08,810 --> 02:15:16,020
"He just said there was something he had to
do, and afterwards he would come back if he

1773
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:17,710
could.

1774
02:15:17,710 --> 02:15:24,420
He said that things weren't as bad as they
seemed... and that I would be looked after."

1775
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:32,060
"So that is why you didn't ask about who gave
you the lease?"

1776
02:15:32,060 --> 02:15:33,950
"Yes."

1777
02:15:33,950 --> 02:15:36,000
Liz was sobbing again now.

1778
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:43,050
"You knew that already, so why did you bring
me here?"

1779
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:49,340
Karden waited for her to stop sobbing, then
turned to the silent members of the Tribunal.

1780
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:57,260
"It is fortunate that Leamas met this girl
because now we can be certain that there was

1781
02:15:57,260 --> 02:16:01,590
an operation against Comrade Mundt.

1782
02:16:01,590 --> 02:16:08,760
We know that Smiley and the Circus helped
the girl."

1783
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:13,780
As Karden quietly sat down, Leamas stood up.

1784
02:16:13,780 --> 02:16:17,620
The guards did not stop him this time.

1785
02:16:17,620 --> 02:16:22,900
As he walked to the front of the room, he
was trying to work out why the Circus had

1786
02:16:22,900 --> 02:16:25,360
behaved in this way.

1787
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:34,260
"We - Control, Smiley and I - made a careful
story to prove that I was a defector," he

1788
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:35,260
thought.

1789
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:42,319
"But Smiley paid my bills and even bought
the lease of Liz's flat and gave it to her.

1790
02:16:42,319 --> 02:16:47,840
Why would they try to make the operation go
wrong?

1791
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:54,519
And how do the East Germans know so much about
me?"

1792
02:16:54,519 --> 02:17:00,889
Leamas couldn't understand it, but he knew
that he had to help Liz and Fiedler.

1793
02:17:00,889 --> 02:17:06,840
He had to make a confession about the operation
against Mundt.

1794
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:10,920
His face was white as he stood in front of
Karden.

1795
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:14,989
"Let her go," he said.

1796
02:17:14,989 --> 02:17:19,300
Liz was staring at him with tears in her eyes.

1797
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:22,659
"No, Alec," she said.

1798
02:17:22,659 --> 02:17:25,519
"Don't tell them anything because of me."

1799
02:17:25,519 --> 02:17:30,950
"It's too late now," said Leamas.

1800
02:17:30,950 --> 02:17:32,949
Then he turned to the President.

1801
02:17:32,949 --> 02:17:36,050
"She knows nothing.

1802
02:17:36,050 --> 02:17:37,379
Send her home.

1803
02:17:37,379 --> 02:17:42,139
I'll tell you everything."

1804
02:17:42,139 --> 02:17:48,359
The President talked quietly to the men on
either side of her, then said, "She can leave

1805
02:17:48,359 --> 02:17:53,499
the court, but she can't go home until the
Tribunal has finished."

1806
02:17:53,499 --> 02:17:57,010
"She knows nothing!"

1807
02:17:57,010 --> 02:17:58,899
shouted Leamas.

1808
02:17:58,899 --> 02:18:01,729
"Karden is right.

1809
02:18:01,729 --> 02:18:03,899
It was an operation to get rid of Mundt.

1810
02:18:03,899 --> 02:18:06,149
Let her go."

1811
02:18:06,149 --> 02:18:10,599
"She is a witness," replied the woman.

1812
02:18:10,599 --> 02:18:14,250
"Fiedler may want to question her."

1813
02:18:14,250 --> 02:18:19,459
"She knows nothing," said Fiedler.

1814
02:18:19,459 --> 02:18:23,699
He was sitting with his hands on his knees,
looking down at them.

1815
02:18:23,699 --> 02:18:26,719
"Leamas is right.

1816
02:18:26,719 --> 02:18:29,739
Let her go."

1817
02:18:29,739 --> 02:18:35,209
He stood up and led Liz to the door with his
arm around her shoulders.

1818
02:18:35,209 --> 02:18:41,510
Liz looked back at Leamas, but he could not
look at her.

1819
02:18:41,510 --> 02:18:49,679
"Go back to England," said Fiedler, gently,
and Liz began to sob as the woman in the grey

1820
02:18:49,679 --> 02:18:54,010
uniform took her out.

1821
02:18:54,010 --> 02:18:57,369
Leamas began to speak to everyone in the room.

1822
02:18:57,369 --> 02:19:00,880
"Karden is right.

1823
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:08,269
After all our East German spies were killed,
we - Control, Smiley and I - decided to get

1824
02:19:08,269 --> 02:19:10,069
rid of Mundt.

1825
02:19:10,069 --> 02:19:15,999
"You know what we did so that you would think
I was a defector.

1826
02:19:15,999 --> 02:19:21,719
Smiley always said the operation could go
wrong, but I don't know why he paid my bills

1827
02:19:21,719 --> 02:19:24,949
and bought the girl's lease."

1828
02:19:24,949 --> 02:19:27,229
He turned to the President.

1829
02:19:27,229 --> 02:19:33,590
"Fiedler hates Mundt, but Mundt isn't an agent
for the British.

1830
02:19:33,590 --> 02:19:37,679
Fiedler just believed in my story.

1831
02:19:37,679 --> 02:19:43,699
He's a good, honest man, working for his country."

1832
02:19:43,699 --> 02:19:48,439
Fiedler smiled and said, "It's strange.

1833
02:19:48,439 --> 02:19:54,359
The Circus would expect Mundt to check up
on Leamas's story, wouldn't they?

1834
02:19:54,359 --> 02:19:56,930
That's why they made it so good.

1835
02:19:56,930 --> 02:20:02,779
So I wonder why Smiley paid the bills and
bought the lease?"

1836
02:20:02,779 --> 02:20:09,729
"I don't know, and I don't know how Mundt
found the girl," said Leamas.

1837
02:20:09,729 --> 02:20:12,279
"I've been very stupid."

1838
02:20:12,279 --> 02:20:18,450
"But Mundt hasn't been stupid," said Fiedler,
smiling again.

1839
02:20:18,450 --> 02:20:21,970
"How did he know about the lease?

1840
02:20:21,970 --> 02:20:25,430
Perhaps he can tell us."

1841
02:20:25,430 --> 02:20:32,229
"She increased the amount she paid to the
Party every month," Mundt said.

1842
02:20:32,229 --> 02:20:40,909
"She doesn't earn much money, so I checked
why she could suddenly afford to pay more.

1843
02:20:40,909 --> 02:20:43,790
Then I found out about the lease."

1844
02:20:43,790 --> 02:20:50,370
"That's a good answer," replied Fiedler, calmly.

1845
02:20:50,370 --> 02:20:58,720
Then the President said, "Comrade Fiedler
will not do any more work until the Praesidium

1846
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:02,130
has thought about our report.

1847
02:21:02,130 --> 02:21:09,579
Leamas has already been arrested and Comrade
Mundt will decide what to do with him."

1848
02:21:09,579 --> 02:21:14,649
She looked at Mundt, but he was looking at
Fiedler.

1849
02:21:14,649 --> 02:21:22,189
And as Leamas looked at them both, he suddenly
understood the Circus's plan.

1850
02:21:22,189 --> 02:21:27,989
It was horribly clear.

1851
02:21:27,989 --> 02:21:34,169
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
In from the cold

1852
02:21:34,169 --> 02:21:40,120
Liz had been in a small, dark room for many
hours when she heard footsteps in the corridor

1853
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:42,079
outside.

1854
02:21:42,079 --> 02:21:46,249
She had no idea whether it was day or night.

1855
02:21:46,249 --> 02:21:51,939
The door opened, and a man stood there without
coming into the room.

1856
02:21:51,939 --> 02:21:57,739
A small amount of blue light from the corridor
came into the room so that she recognized

1857
02:21:57,739 --> 02:21:59,239
him immediately.

1858
02:21:59,239 --> 02:22:02,629
"It's Mundt," he said.

1859
02:22:02,629 --> 02:22:07,560
"Come with me immediately."

1860
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:12,819
Liz was terrified and stood in the middle
of the room, not knowing what to do.

1861
02:22:12,819 --> 02:22:14,329
"Come on!

1862
02:22:14,329 --> 02:22:16,619
Hurry!" he said.

1863
02:22:16,619 --> 02:22:25,699
He stepped into the room, took hold of her
arm and led her out into the corridor.

1864
02:22:25,699 --> 02:22:30,569
She watched, confused, as he locked the door
of the room.

1865
02:22:30,569 --> 02:22:35,350
Then he made her run down a number of badly
lit corridors.

1866
02:22:35,350 --> 02:22:40,220
She noticed that he always checked that no
one was coming as they turned into another

1867
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:42,580
corridor.

1868
02:22:42,580 --> 02:22:49,830
Suddenly he stopped, put a key in a door and
pushed her outside.

1869
02:22:49,830 --> 02:22:54,970
She could feel the cold air of the winter
evening on her face.

1870
02:22:54,970 --> 02:22:59,869
He led her forward again, along a path towards
a road.

1871
02:22:59,869 --> 02:23:03,199
Parked by the side of the road was a car.

1872
02:23:03,199 --> 02:23:06,210
Standing beside it was Alec Leamas.

1873
02:23:06,210 --> 02:23:13,909
"Wait here," said Mundt, as he started to
move towards Leamas.

1874
02:23:13,909 --> 02:23:18,600
She waited for a long while as the two men
talked quietly to each other.

1875
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:23,629
Her body shook because of the cold and her
fear.

1876
02:23:23,629 --> 02:23:26,779
Finally, Mundt returned.

1877
02:23:26,779 --> 02:23:33,649
"Come with me," he said, and he led her to
where Leamas stood.

1878
02:23:33,649 --> 02:23:38,300
The two men looked at each other for a moment.

1879
02:23:38,300 --> 02:23:41,260
"Goodbye," said Mundt.

1880
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:46,330
"You're a stupid man, Leamas."

1881
02:23:46,330 --> 02:23:50,949
And he turned and walked quickly away.

1882
02:23:50,949 --> 02:23:57,970
She put out her hand and touched Leamas, but
he pushed it away and opened the car door.

1883
02:23:57,970 --> 02:24:00,680
"Alec," she whispered.

1884
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:04,249
"Why is he letting us go?"

1885
02:24:04,249 --> 02:24:09,359
"He's letting us go because we've done our
job," said Leamas.

1886
02:24:09,359 --> 02:24:11,680
"Don't think about it.

1887
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:14,310
Get in the car."

1888
02:24:14,310 --> 02:24:17,270
She got in and asked again, "Why?

1889
02:24:17,270 --> 02:24:23,510
They said you worked with Fiedler against
him."

1890
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:25,850
Leamas did not answer.

1891
02:24:25,850 --> 02:24:31,130
He started the car and was soon driving along
a narrow road.

1892
02:24:31,130 --> 02:24:32,979
He looked at his watch.

1893
02:24:32,979 --> 02:24:37,499
"We're five hours away from Berlin," he said.

1894
02:24:37,499 --> 02:24:41,319
"We need to be there by quarter to one.

1895
02:24:41,319 --> 02:24:44,649
There's enough time."

1896
02:24:44,649 --> 02:24:47,369
For a while, Liz said nothing.

1897
02:24:47,369 --> 02:24:55,039
Then she said, "You and Mundt are enemies,
aren't you?"

1898
02:24:55,039 --> 02:24:57,989
Leamas still did not reply.

1899
02:24:57,989 --> 02:25:04,069
He was driving very fast now, with his tense
hands holding the wheel tightly.

1900
02:25:04,069 --> 02:25:07,680
"What will happen to Fiedler?"

1901
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:12,569
asked Liz, suddenly, and this time Leamas
answered.

1902
02:25:12,569 --> 02:25:16,699
"Mundt will arrange for him to be shot," he
said.

1903
02:25:16,699 --> 02:25:20,779
"So why aren't they going to shoot you?"

1904
02:25:20,779 --> 02:25:22,289
she asked, quickly.

1905
02:25:22,289 --> 02:25:24,970
"Why has Mundt let you go?"

1906
02:25:24,970 --> 02:25:26,989
"All right!"

1907
02:25:26,989 --> 02:25:28,109
shouted Leamas.

1908
02:25:28,109 --> 02:25:32,869
"I'll tell you what you and I weren't supposed
to know.

1909
02:25:32,869 --> 02:25:34,600
Mundt is a double agent.

1910
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:39,140
He is a spy for the British secret service.

1911
02:25:39,140 --> 02:25:44,319
Fiedler worked out that he was a spy, and
this is the end of an operation by Control

1912
02:25:44,319 --> 02:25:46,439
to save Mundt."

1913
02:25:46,439 --> 02:25:53,800
"The Circus has used us to kill Fiedler and
keep Mundt working for the British.

1914
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:59,199
No one will suspect that Mundt is a double
agent now."

1915
02:25:59,199 --> 02:26:02,140
After a moment, Leamas continued.

1916
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:05,529
"Control lied to me.

1917
02:26:05,529 --> 02:26:11,979
He said that we had to kill Mundt because
he was dangerous to the British secret service.

1918
02:26:11,979 --> 02:26:17,260
He told me that we had to make the East Germans
believe Mundt was a double agent.

1919
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:19,239
Then they would kill him.

1920
02:26:19,239 --> 02:26:22,020
I helped to make the plan.

1921
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:25,890
It was going to be my last job.

1922
02:26:25,890 --> 02:26:32,260
I went downhill, lost my job, got the job
in the library, hit the grocer, went to prison

1923
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:34,470
- you know all that."

1924
02:26:34,470 --> 02:26:38,649
"And you became my lover," said Liz.

1925
02:26:38,649 --> 02:26:42,930
"That wasn't part of the plan," said Leamas.

1926
02:26:42,930 --> 02:26:48,919
"My job was to give evidence to Fiedler that
Mundt was a spy for the British so that the

1927
02:26:48,919 --> 02:26:52,180
East Germans would arrest Mundt.

1928
02:26:52,180 --> 02:26:58,819
I didn't know that Mundt knew everything,
including information about you.

1929
02:26:58,819 --> 02:27:05,310
He sent people to recruit me as a defector
and take me to Holland, then Germany.

1930
02:27:05,310 --> 02:27:08,489
He sent Fiedler to interrogate me.

1931
02:27:08,489 --> 02:27:12,880
Fiedler believed me and sent his evidence
to the Praesidium.

1932
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:18,529
But Mundt could prove I wasn't a real defector
because he had the information about Smiley

1933
02:27:18,529 --> 02:27:24,609
and the Circus looking after you, which they
gave to him.

1934
02:27:24,609 --> 02:27:27,680
Control didn't tell me about that part of
the plan."

1935
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:32,109
"But how could the Circus know about me?"

1936
02:27:32,109 --> 02:27:33,109
Liz cried.

1937
02:27:33,109 --> 02:27:36,220
"They couldn't make us fall in love!"

1938
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:40,270
"It didn't matter," replied Leamas.

1939
02:27:40,270 --> 02:27:45,779
"A man called Pitt at the Labour Exchange
was working for the Circus.

1940
02:27:45,779 --> 02:27:49,180
He sent me to the library so I would meet
you.

1941
02:27:49,180 --> 02:27:54,279
The Circus could make it look like we were
lovers even if we weren't.

1942
02:27:54,279 --> 02:28:00,569
And you were a member of the Communist Party,
so it was easy to invite you to East Germany.

1943
02:28:00,569 --> 02:28:04,369
But we made it very easy for them."

1944
02:28:04,369 --> 02:28:08,329
"Yes, we did," she said.

1945
02:28:08,329 --> 02:28:13,689
"We helped them by becoming lovers, and it
makes me feel awful.

1946
02:28:13,689 --> 02:28:18,760
And I still don't understand why he is letting
me go.

1947
02:28:18,760 --> 02:28:22,640
When I get back, I could tell people about
this."

1948
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:27,359
"Our escape will help Mundt," replied Leamas.

1949
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:32,699
"It will show the Praesidium that there are
still double agents in the organization because

1950
02:28:32,699 --> 02:28:34,409
someone helped us.

1951
02:28:34,409 --> 02:28:38,619
So they will need Mundt's help to find them."

1952
02:28:38,619 --> 02:28:43,340
"So more people can be killed like Fiedler?"

1953
02:28:43,340 --> 02:28:45,399
asked Liz.

1954
02:28:45,399 --> 02:28:51,680
"Fiedler lost, and Mundt won," replied Leamas,
shrugging.

1955
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:53,699
"That's what happens."

1956
02:28:53,699 --> 02:28:58,350
"But Fiedler is a good, honest man," cried
Liz.

1957
02:28:58,350 --> 02:28:59,710
"You said that yourself."

1958
02:28:59,710 --> 02:29:05,090
"And Mundt is a horrible, violent man," said
Leamas.

1959
02:29:05,090 --> 02:29:12,510
"But Fiedler is an enemy, on the other side,
and Mundt is a friend, on the British side.

1960
02:29:12,510 --> 02:29:16,899
This is what the secret services are like,
Liz.

1961
02:29:16,899 --> 02:29:23,310
They do bad things so ordinary people like
you can sleep safely in their beds."

1962
02:29:23,310 --> 02:29:26,579
"It's horrible, Alec!"

1963
02:29:26,579 --> 02:29:27,579
shouted Liz.

1964
02:29:27,579 --> 02:29:30,739
"You are as bad as them."

1965
02:29:30,739 --> 02:29:38,899
"It's the Cold War, and I hate it, Liz," he
replied, sounding very tired.

1966
02:29:38,899 --> 02:29:45,270
"You've never seen men die like I have."

1967
02:29:45,270 --> 02:29:48,640
They were driving along city streets.

1968
02:29:48,640 --> 02:29:53,020
Leamas was suddenly tense, and he slowed the
car.

1969
02:29:53,020 --> 02:29:56,409
Liz saw a small light moving in front of them.

1970
02:29:56,409 --> 02:30:01,939
"That's him," Leamas said to himself, quietly.

1971
02:30:01,939 --> 02:30:07,129
He stopped and opened one of the back doors,
and a man got in.

1972
02:30:07,129 --> 02:30:09,510
Liz did not turn round.

1973
02:30:09,510 --> 02:30:13,109
She just stared at the rain that was now falling.

1974
02:30:13,109 --> 02:30:16,699
"Drive at thirty kilometres an hour.

1975
02:30:16,699 --> 02:30:20,989
I'll tell you the way," said the man.

1976
02:30:20,989 --> 02:30:25,109
Liz thought he sounded tense and frightened,
and very young.

1977
02:30:25,109 --> 02:30:32,119
"When we reach the right place, you must get
out and run straight to the Wall," he said

1978
02:30:32,119 --> 02:30:33,369
to Leamas.

1979
02:30:33,369 --> 02:30:37,600
"The searchlight will shine where you must
climb.

1980
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:41,430
When the searchlight moves away, begin to
climb.

1981
02:30:41,430 --> 02:30:43,819
The girl must follow you.

1982
02:30:43,819 --> 02:30:47,930
You'll have to sit on the top and pull the
girl up.

1983
02:30:47,930 --> 02:30:49,979
Do you understand?"

1984
02:30:49,979 --> 02:30:53,430
"We understand," replied Leamas.

1985
02:30:53,430 --> 02:30:56,340
"How long is it before we get there?"

1986
02:30:56,340 --> 02:31:01,250
"We will be there in about nine minutes,"
said the man.

1987
02:31:01,250 --> 02:31:04,109
"They have only given you a short time.

1988
02:31:04,109 --> 02:31:09,159
The searchlight will move away at five past
one.

1989
02:31:09,159 --> 02:31:12,330
Then you have ninety seconds to escape.

1990
02:31:12,330 --> 02:31:13,619
And don't turn back.

1991
02:31:13,619 --> 02:31:17,140
If you fall or get hurt, keep going.

1992
02:31:17,140 --> 02:31:20,909
They will shoot anyone they see on this side
of the Wall.

1993
02:31:20,909 --> 02:31:23,579
You must get over it."

1994
02:31:23,579 --> 02:31:28,069
"We know," said Leamas.

1995
02:31:28,069 --> 02:31:33,659
Leamas drove the car carefully through the
dark, wet streets, turning right and left

1996
02:31:33,659 --> 02:31:36,460
when the young man told him to do so.

1997
02:31:36,460 --> 02:31:40,470
"We're nearly there," said the young man.

1998
02:31:40,470 --> 02:31:44,300
"Go slowly," he continued.

1999
02:31:44,300 --> 02:31:47,180
"Now turn left.

2000
02:31:47,180 --> 02:31:49,100
Turn left!"

2001
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:52,819
They were in a very dark, narrow street.

2002
02:31:52,819 --> 02:31:58,060
The young man told Leamas to stop the car
and turn off the lights.

2003
02:31:58,060 --> 02:32:03,149
"Look," he said, pointing down a small street
to their left.

2004
02:32:03,149 --> 02:32:10,040
They could see a small part of the Wall, huge
and grey-brown in the yellow lights, with

2005
02:32:10,040 --> 02:32:12,300
barbed wire on top of it.

2006
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:20,669
"There is a small cut in the wire in the place
where you must climb," he said to them.

2007
02:32:20,669 --> 02:32:23,460
All three of them got out of the car.

2008
02:32:23,460 --> 02:32:27,789
"Goodbye," said the young man.

2009
02:32:27,789 --> 02:32:32,879
Liz looked at his face and knew that he was
very frightened.

2010
02:32:32,879 --> 02:32:37,390
"Goodbye," she said.

2011
02:32:37,390 --> 02:32:42,739
As they were walking along the street, they
heard the car drive away.

2012
02:32:42,739 --> 02:32:48,380
They stopped in the darkness on a small piece
of ground not far from the Wall.

2013
02:32:48,380 --> 02:32:54,100
"Two minutes to go," said Leamas, looking
at his watch.

2014
02:32:54,100 --> 02:32:58,239
Liz said nothing.

2015
02:32:58,239 --> 02:33:03,289
As they watched the searchlight move along
the Wall and stop in front of them, Leamas

2016
02:33:03,289 --> 02:33:05,420
looked at his watch again.

2017
02:33:05,420 --> 02:33:09,029
"Are you ready?" he asked.

2018
02:33:09,029 --> 02:33:11,699
Liz nodded.

2019
02:33:11,699 --> 02:33:17,810
Leamas took hold of her arm, and they began
to walk across the small piece of ground.

2020
02:33:17,810 --> 02:33:23,590
Liz wanted to run, but he held her arm tightly
because he could not really believe that Mundt

2021
02:33:23,590 --> 02:33:25,479
was letting her go.

2022
02:33:25,479 --> 02:33:29,140
He did not understand it.

2023
02:33:29,140 --> 02:33:35,840
They were almost there when the searchlight
moved away and they were in darkness.

2024
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:40,579
Leamas continued walking until he could feel
the rough concrete blocks of the Wall with

2025
02:33:40,579 --> 02:33:42,739
his hand.

2026
02:33:42,739 --> 02:33:47,569
Looking up, he could just see that there was
a small gap in the wire on the top.

2027
02:33:47,569 --> 02:33:53,260
There were pieces of metal in the Wall that
he could use as steps.

2028
02:33:53,260 --> 02:33:57,680
Putting his foot on the first one, he started
to climb.

2029
02:33:57,680 --> 02:34:02,499
When he was on the last one, he reached up
to pull himself on to the top.

2030
02:34:02,499 --> 02:34:06,199
"Come on," he whispered.

2031
02:34:06,199 --> 02:34:08,859
"Start climbing."

2032
02:34:08,859 --> 02:34:14,189
He lay down and took hold of her hand as she
came to the last metal step.

2033
02:34:14,189 --> 02:34:17,930
Slowly, he started to pull her up.

2034
02:34:17,930 --> 02:34:23,159
Suddenly, enormous lights came on all round
them.

2035
02:34:23,159 --> 02:34:27,130
Leamas was shocked, and it seemed as if he
was blind.

2036
02:34:27,130 --> 02:34:32,430
He still held Liz's hand, but her feet had
come off the metal steps, so she was hanging

2037
02:34:32,430 --> 02:34:33,770
in the air.

2038
02:34:33,770 --> 02:34:38,979
He called her name and started again to pull
her up.

2039
02:34:38,979 --> 02:34:43,520
Then there was the sound of sirens and shouting.

2040
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:50,270
Leamas knelt on the rough concrete and got
hold of both of her arms, pulling her to him.

2041
02:34:50,270 --> 02:34:54,669
Then they shot her.

2042
02:34:54,669 --> 02:35:00,379
Leamas felt the shots as they hit her, three
or four of them, and her thin arms fell from

2043
02:35:00,379 --> 02:35:02,220
his hands.

2044
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:08,789
He heard a voice shout in English from the
other side of the Wall, 'Jump, Alec!

2045
02:35:08,789 --> 02:35:11,229
Jump, man!"

2046
02:35:11,229 --> 02:35:13,119
Now there was more shouting.

2047
02:35:13,119 --> 02:35:17,510
There were English voices and German voices.

2048
02:35:17,510 --> 02:35:20,710
Leamas heard Smiley's voice, quite close to
him.

2049
02:35:20,710 --> 02:35:25,930
"The girl - where's the girl?"

2050
02:35:25,930 --> 02:35:31,560
Leamas put his hand above his eyes to keep
the bright lights away and looked down.

2051
02:35:31,560 --> 02:35:34,279
He saw Liz, lying on the ground.

2052
02:35:34,279 --> 02:35:43,850
For a moment, he did nothing, and then he
began to climb back down the same metal steps.

2053
02:35:43,850 --> 02:35:45,899
He stood beside her.

2054
02:35:45,899 --> 02:35:50,670
She was dead.

2055
02:35:50,670 --> 02:35:57,569
Nothing happened for a moment, and then they
shot him.

2056
02:35:57,569 --> 02:36:04,219
As he fell next to Liz, Leamas knew that he
had finally come in from the cold.

2057
02:36:04,219 --> 02:36:04,399
- THE END -
