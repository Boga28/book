1
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:02,339
ACT ONE

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:03,339
(The living room of Algernon Moncrieff's flat
in Mayfair, London.

3
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:04,339
Lane is arranging afternoon tea on a table.

4
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:05,339
Algernon enters)

5
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,339
Algernon: Lane, have you made the cucumber
sandwiches for Lady Bracknell's tea?

6
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,339
Lane: Yes, sir.

7
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,339
(Handing them to Algernon on a silver tray)

8
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,339
Algernon: (Looking carefully at them, taking
two and sitting down on the sofa) Oh, by the

9
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:11,140
way, Lane, I looked at your notebook.

10
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:17,110
I noticed that when Lord Shoreman and Mr Worthing
dined with me on Thursday night, eight bottles

11
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,600
of champagne were drunk.

12
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,640
Lane: Yes, sir; eight bottles.

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,470
Algernon: Why is it that, in a bachelor's
home, the servants always drink the champagne?

14
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,699
I just ask because I am interested, Lane.

15
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:32,859
Lane: I think that it is because the champagne
is better in a bachelor's home.

16
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:37,441
I have noticed that the champagne in married
people's homes is rarely very good.

17
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:39,920
Algernon: Good heavens!

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,320
Is marriage so depressing?

19
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,850
Lane: I believe marriage is very pleasant,
sir.

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,750
I haven't had much experience of it myself.

21
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:53,200
I have only been married once, and that was
because of a misunderstanding between myself

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
and a young person.

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,400
Algernon: (Lazily, without interest) I am
not very interested in your family life, Lane.

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,070
Lane: No, sir; it is not a very interesting
subject.

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,080
I never think of it myself.

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,270
Algernon: That is very understandable.

27
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,890
Well, thank you, Lane.

28
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,100
(Lane goes off)

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,369
Algernon: (To himself) Lane's views on marriage
seem very casual.

30
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:17,490
Really, if the servants don't set us a good
example, what on earth is the use of them?

31
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,670
They seem to have no morals.

32
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,670
(Lane enters)

33
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,759
Lane: Mr Ernest Worthing is here, sir.

34
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:23,759
(Jack enters.

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,759
Lane goes off)

36
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:26,829
Algernon: How are you, my dear Ernest?

37
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:28,069
What brings you to town?

38
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:31,340
Jack: Oh, pleasure brings me, pleasure, of
course!

39
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,530
What else should bring one anywhere?

40
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,689
You're eating as usual, I see, Algy!

41
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:39,689
Algernon: (Very formally) I believe it is
normal in good society to have some light

42
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,149
refreshment at five o'clock.

43
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:44,130
(In a normal voice) Where have you been since
last Thursday?

44
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,349
Jack: (Sitting down on the sofa) In the country.

45
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:47,529
Algernon: What on earth do you do in the country?

46
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:51,929
Jack: (Taking off his gloves) When one is
in town one entertains oneself.

47
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:54,889
When one is in the country one entertains
other people.

48
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,119
It is very boring.

49
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,869
Algernon: And who are the people you entertain?

50
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,539
Jack: Oh, neighbours, neighbours!

51
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:03,819
Algernon: Have you got nice neighbours in
your part of Shropshire?

52
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,869
Jack: No, they're all horrid.

53
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:07,469
I never speak to any of them.

54
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,500
Algernon: You must entertain them very much,
then!

55
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,319
(Going over to the table and taking a sandwich)
By the way, Shropshire is where you come from,

56
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,540
is it not?

57
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,540
Jack: Shropshire?

58
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,650
Yes, of course.

59
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,650
My dear fellow!

60
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,379
Why are all these cups here?

61
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,430
Why cucumber sandwiches?

62
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,330
Why are you being so extravagant?

63
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,360
Who is coming to tea?

64
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,189
Algernon: Oh, just Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.

65
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,900
Jack: How perfectly delightful!

66
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,300
Algernon: Yes, but I am afraid Aunt Augusta
won't be happy that you're here.

67
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,950
Jack: And why is that?

68
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,659
Algernon: My dear fellow, the way that you
flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful.

69
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,840
It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts
with you.

70
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,220
Jack: I am in love with Gwendolen.

71
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,140
I have come to town in order to propose marriage
to her.

72
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,180
Algernon: I thought you had come to town for
pleasure.

73
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,459
I call a marriage proposal business.

74
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,810
Jack: How very unromantic you are!

75
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,569
Algernon: I really don't think proposing is
romantic.

76
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:06,439
It is very romantic to be in love.

77
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:10,780
But there is nothing romantic about a proposal.

78
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,040
Someone might accept.

79
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,390
They usually do, I believe.

80
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,250
Then the exciting time is over.

81
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,360
The most important thing about romance is
the uncertainty.

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,349
If I ever marry, I'll certainly try to forget
that I am married.

83
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,810
Jack: I believe you, dear Algy.

84
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,659
The Divorce Court was especially invented
for people with memories like yours.

85
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,230
(Jack puts out his hand to take a cucumber
sandwich; Algernon immediately stops him)

86
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,139
Algernon: Oh, there is no point in thinking
about that.

87
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:38,760
Divorces are made in Heaven.

88
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,329
Please don't touch the cucumber sandwiches.

89
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,890
They were ordered specially for Aunt Augusta.

90
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,970
(Taking a sandwich himself and eating it)

91
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,469
Jack: Well, you have been eating them all
the time.

92
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,120
Algernon: That is different.

93
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
She is my aunt.

94
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,420
(Offering Jack a different plate) Have some
bread and butter.

95
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,349
The bread and butter is for Gwendolen.

96
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:54,609
Gwendolen loves bread and butter.

97
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,849
Jack: (Helping himself to bread and butter)
And very good bread and butter it is too.

98
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,530
Algernon: Well, my dear fellow, you don't
need to eat it all.

99
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,749
You are behaving as if you are married to
her already.

100
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:09,870
But you are not married to her and I don't
think you ever will be.

101
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,129
Jack: Why on earth do you say that?

102
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:16,109
Algernon: Well, firstly, girls never marry
the men they flirt with.

103
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:18,569
They don't think it's the right thing to do.

104
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:19,989
Jack: Oh, that is nonsense!

105
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:20,989
Algernon: It isn't.

106
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:21,989
It's true.

107
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:25,720
(Taking two more sandwiches) That's why one
sees such a large number of bachelors all

108
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,050
over the place.

109
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,050
And secondly, I don't give my consent.

110
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,819
Jack: Your consent!

111
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:34,400
Algernon: Gwendolen is my cousin.

112
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,440
And before I allow you to marry her, you will
have to clear up the matter of Cecily.

113
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,470
(Algernon rings a bell)

114
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,470
Jack: Cecily?

115
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,470
What on earth do you mean, Algy?

116
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,400
I don't know anyone called Cecily.

117
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
(Lane enters)

118
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,030
Algernon: Lane, bring me the cigarette case
which Mr Worthing left last time he dined

119
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,030
here.

120
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,030
Lane: Yes, sir.

121
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,030
(Lane goes off.

122
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,030
Algernon takes the last of the cucumber sandwiches)

123
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,759
Jack: Have you had my cigarette case all this
time?

124
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,710
I wish you had told me.

125
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,699
I have been writing letters to the police
about it.

126
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,569
I nearly offered a large reward.

127
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:07,880
Algernon: Well, I wish you would offer a large
reward.

128
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,509
I am very poor at the moment.

129
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,681
Jack: There is no point in offering a large
reward now that you've found it.

130
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:14,681
(Lane enters with the cigarette case on a
silver tray.

131
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,681
Algernon takes it immediately.

132
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:16,681
Lane goes off)

133
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:17,681
Algernon: I think that is mean of you, Ernest,
I must say.

134
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:20,280
(Opening the case and examining it) However,
it doesn't matter.

135
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,520
Now I look at the inscription inside, I see
that this isn't yours.

136
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,169
Jack: Of course it's mine.

137
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,440
(Moving towards Algernon) You have seen me
with it a hundred times, and you shouldn't

138
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,140
be reading what is written inside it.

139
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,360
It is very impolite to read a private cigarette
case.

140
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Algernon: Oh!

141
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,630
It is ridiculous to have rules about what
one should read and what one shouldn't.

142
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,380
Most of modern culture depends on reading
what one shouldn't read.

143
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,069
Jack: I know that, and I am not going to discuss
modern culture.

144
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:50,680
I simply want my cigarette case back.

145
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,319
Algernon: Yes; but this isn't your cigarette
case.

146
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,590
This cigarette case is a present from someone
called Cecily.

147
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,220
And you said you don't know anyone called
Cecily.

148
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,500
Jack: Well, if you want to know, Cecily is
my aunt.

149
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,060
Algernon: Your aunt?

150
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,110
Jack: Yes.

151
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,370
She is a charming old lady.

152
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,300
Just give it back to me, Algy.

153
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,169
Algernon: (Going behind the sofa) But why
does she call herself 'little Cecily' if she

154
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:21,220
is your aunt?

155
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,220
(Reading) 'From little Cecily, with all her
love.'

156
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,710
Jack: (Going to the front of the sofa and
kneeling on it) My dear fellow, some aunts

157
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,020
are tall.

158
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,669
Some aunts are not tall.

159
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:37,229
My aunt should be allowed to decide her height
for herself.

160
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,270
You seem to think that every aunt should be
like your aunt, Lady Bracknell!

161
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,340
That is ridiculous.

162
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,960
Now, give me back my cigarette case.

163
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,680
(Following Algernon all around the room)

164
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Algernon: Yes.

165
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,360
But why does your aunt call you her uncle?

166
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,870
(Reading) 'From little Cecily, with all her
love to her dear Uncle Jack.'

167
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,500
I don't object to an aunt being a small aunt.

168
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,530
But why does an aunt, whatever her size, call
her own nephew 'uncle'?

169
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,710
I don't understand.

170
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,370
And your name isn't Jack; it is Ernest.

171
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,830
Jack: It isn't Ernest; it's Jack.

172
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,430
Algernon: You have always told me that your
name is Ernest.

173
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,189
I have introduced you to everyone as Ernest.

174
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,400
You answer to the name Ernest.

175
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,729
You look as if your name is Ernest.

176
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:32,449
You are the most earnest-looking person I
have ever seen in my life.

177
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:37,289
It is perfectly ridiculous to tell me your
name isn't Ernest.

178
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:38,879
It is on your visiting cards.

179
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,230
Here is one of them.

180
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,680
(Taking it from a case) 'Mr Ernest Worthing,
B.4, The Albany, London.'

181
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,350
I'll keep this as proof that your name is
Ernest.

182
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,810
Don't ever try to deny it to me or to Gwendolen
or to anyone else.

183
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,220
(Putting the card in his pocket)

184
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:01,300
Jack: Well, my name is Ernest in town and
Jack in the country, and the cigarette case

185
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,020
was given to me in the country.

186
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:10,780
Algernon: That does not explain why your small
Aunt Cecily calls you her dear uncle.

187
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,730
My dear fellow, you had better tell me everything.

188
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,730
Go on!

189
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:21,590
I have always suspected that you were a secret
Bunburyist and now I am quite sure.

190
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,710
Jack: Bunburyist?

191
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,680
What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?

192
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,490
Algernon: I'll tell you the meaning of Bunburyist
when you tell me why you are Ernest in town

193
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,920
and Jack in the country.

194
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,220
Jack: Well, give me my cigarette case first.

195
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,220
Algernon: Here it is.

196
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,030
(Handing Jack the cigarette case) Now give
me your explanation and please make it unbelievable.

197
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,030
(Sitting on the sofa)

198
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:49,140
Jack: My dear fellow, there is nothing unbelievable
about my explanation.

199
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,660
In fact, it's perfectly ordinary.

200
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,440
I was brought up by an old gentleman called
Thomas Cardew.

201
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:02,530
He adopted me when I was a little boy and
he made me the guardian of his granddaughter,

202
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,870
Miss Cecily Cardew, in his will.

203
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:12,530
Cecily is my ward and calls me uncle because
she respects me, although you wouldn't understand

204
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,690
that!

205
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,810
You don't understand respect.

206
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,310
Cecily lives in my house in the country and
is looked after by her excellent governess,

207
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,400
Miss Prism.

208
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,640
Algernon: Where is your house in the country,
by the way?

209
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,630
Jack: That is nothing to do with you, my dear
fellow.

210
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:36,480
I am not going to invite you there... but
I will tell you honestly that the house is

211
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,100
not in Shropshire.

212
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,780
Algernon: I guessed that, my dear fellow!

213
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,200
I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire twice.

214
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,670
Now, go on.

215
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,930
Why are you Ernest in town and Jack in the
country?

216
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:55,120
Jack: My dear Algy, I don't know whether you
will understand.

217
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,660
You are not a very serious person.

218
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,420
I will try to explain it to you.

219
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:07,710
I am a responsible guardian and I have to
behave well all the time in the country.

220
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,420
It is my duty.

221
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,940
But it is not very good for my health or my
happiness.

222
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:19,780
So, when I want to leave the country and come
to town, I pretend to have a younger brother

223
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,920
called Ernest.

224
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:27,240
I tell everyone that he lives in The Albany
and that he gets into the most terrible trouble.

225
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,190
That, my dear Algy, is the truth.

226
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,180
Algernon: You are a Bunburyist!

227
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,860
I was right to say you were a Bunburyist.

228
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,630
You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists
I know.

229
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,280
Jack: What on earth do you mean?

230
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,730
Algernon: You have invented a younger brother
called Ernest so that you can come to town

231
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,480
as often as you like.

232
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,530
I have invented an invalid called Bunbury
so that I can go to the country as often as

233
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,080
I like.

234
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,260
When I pretend to visit him, I call it Bunburying.

235
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,020
And I call someone who visits imaginary people
a Bunburyist.

236
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,250
Bunbury is very valuable.

237
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,760
For example, if it wasn't for Bunbury's very
bad health, I wouldn't be able to dine with

238
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,910
you tonight.

239
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,700
I should be dining with Aunt Augusta.

240
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,490
Jack: I haven't asked you to dine with me
tonight.

241
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,880
Algernon: I know.

242
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,940
You are very careless about sending out invitations.

243
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,420
It is very foolish of you.

244
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,310
Nothing annoys people more than not receiving
invitations.

245
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,840
Jack: You ought to dine with your Aunt Augusta.

246
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,630
Algernon: I don't have any intention of dining
with Aunt Augusta.

247
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:48,190
Firstly, I dined there on Monday and once
a week is enough time to spend with one's

248
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,390
relations.

249
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:56,520
Secondly, Aunt Augusta will either give me
two women to talk to at dinner or none.

250
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:03,250
And thirdly, I know that tonight she will
make me sit next to Mary Farquhar, who always

251
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,900
flirts with her own husband across the dinner
table.

252
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,040
It is not very pleasant.

253
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,510
In fact, respectable women should not behave
like that... and more and more women are doing

254
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,510
it.

255
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:22,460
The number of women in London who flirt with
their own husbands is terrible.

256
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,110
It looks so bad.

257
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:30,820
Well, now I know that you are a Bunburyist,
I want to talk to you about Bunburying.

258
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,510
I want to tell you the rules.

259
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,360
Jack: I am not a Bunburyist.

260
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,510
If Gwendolen agrees to marry me, I am going
to kill my brother.

261
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,620
In fact, I think I will kill him anyway.

262
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,190
Cecily is a little too interested in him.

263
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,990
So I am going to get rid of Ernest.

264
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:54,800
And I think you should kill Mr... your invalid
friend with the ridiculous name.

265
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,020
Algernon: Nothing will make me kill Bunbury,
and, if you ever get married, you will be

266
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,700
glad to know Bunbury.

267
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:07,610
A man who marries without knowing Bunbury
will have a very boring marriage.

268
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,930
Jack: That is nonsense.

269
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:15,700
If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen,
I certainly won't want to know Bunbury.

270
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,380
Algernon: Then your wife will want to know
him.

271
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,960
You don't understand that in married life
three is company and two is none.

272
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,270
Jack: Don't try to be cynical.

273
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,250
It's perfectly easy to be cynical.

274
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,430
Algernon: My dear fellow, it isn't easy to
be anything these days.

275
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,430
There is so much competition.

276
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:40,830
(There is the sound of a doorbell being rung
for a long time) Ah!

277
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,830
That must be Aunt Augusta.

278
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,630
Only relatives ring like that.

279
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:51,760
Now, I will take her out of the room for ten
minutes so that you can propose to Gwendolen.

280
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,960
So I can dine with you tonight, can't I?

281
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,160
Jack: I suppose so, if you want to.

282
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,550
Algernon: Good.

283
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,950
(Lane enters)

284
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,220
Lane: Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax are
here, sir.

285
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,220
(Algernon goes forward to meet them.

286
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Lady Bracknell and Gwendolen enter)

287
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,990
Lady Bracknell: Good afternoon, dear Algernon.

288
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,620
I hope you are behaving very well.

289
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,490
Algernon: I'm feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.

290
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,560
Lady Bracknell: Feeling very well is not the
same as behaving very well.

291
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,800
In fact, the two things rarely go together.

292
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,150
Algernon: (To Gwendolen) Good heavens, you
are smart!

293
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,490
Gwendolen: I am always smart!

294
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,010
Aren't I, Mr Worthing?

295
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,620
Jack: You're quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.

296
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,820
Gwendolen: Oh!

297
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,460
I hope I am not perfect.

298
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:40,760
There would be no room for development and
I intend to develop in every direction.

299
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,220
(Gwendolen and Jack sit down together in a
corner of the room)

300
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:48,190
Lady Bracknell: I am sorry if we are a little
late, Algernon, but I had to visit Lady Harbury.

301
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,830
I hadn't seen her since her poor husband died.

302
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:59,420
She has changed very much; she looks quite
twenty years younger.

303
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:05,270
And now I'll have a cup of tea and one of
those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised

304
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,270
me.

305
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,270
Algernon: Certainly, Aunt Augusta.

306
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,270
(Going over to the tea table)

307
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,020
Lady Bracknell: Will you come and sit here,
Gwendolen?

308
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,760
Gwendolen: Thanks, Mama, I'm quite comfortable
over here.

309
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,540
Algernon: (Picking up the empty plate of sandwiches
in horror) Good heavens!

310
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,540
Lane!

311
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,670
Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?

312
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,890
I ordered them specially.

313
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,380
Lane: (Seriously) There were no cucumbers
in the market this morning, sir.

314
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,090
I went there twice.

315
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,960
Algernon: No cucumbers?

316
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,830
Lane: No, sir.

317
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,330
Algernon: Thank you, Lane.

318
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,330
You may go.

319
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,350
Lane: Thank you, sir.

320
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,350
(Goes off)

321
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,480
Algernon: I am very upset that there were
no cucumbers, Aunt Augusta.

322
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,250
Lady Bracknell: It doesn't matter, Algernon.

323
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,750
I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury.

324
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,290
Algernon: I hear that her hair has turned
quite blonde from grief.

325
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,290
Lady Bracknell: It certainly has changed its
colour.

326
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,320
I do not know why, of course.

327
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,120
(Algernon takes her a cup of tea) Thank you.

328
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,860
I've got quite a treat for you at dinner tonight,
Algernon.

329
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,290
I am going to seat you next to Mary Farquhar.

330
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,400
She is such a nice woman and she is so sweet
to her husband.

331
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,730
It's delightful to watch them.

332
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,820
Algernon: I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I cannot
dine with you tonight after all.

333
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,110
Lady Bracknell: (Frowning) I hope you can,
Algernon.

334
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,130
There will be thirteen people at the dining
table if you aren't there.

335
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,730
That is unlucky.

336
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,010
Your uncle will have to eat upstairs.

337
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,320
Fortunately, he often has to do that.

338
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,430
Algernon: It is terribly disappointing to
me, but I've had a telegram to say that my

339
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,670
poor friend Bunbury is very ill again.

340
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,230
(Smiling quickly at Jack) They think I should
be with him.

341
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,090
Lady Bracknell: It is very strange.

342
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,430
Mr Bunbury seems to suffer from very bad health.

343
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,410
Algernon: Yes, indeed.

344
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,080
He is a permanent invalid.

345
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:10,230
Lady Bracknell: Well, Algernon, I think it's
about time that Mr Bunbury decides whether

346
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,350
he is going to live or die.

347
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,699
I don't sympathize with invalids.

348
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:18,990
Illness should not be encouraged in others.

349
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,360
One should be healthy.

350
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:26,169
Could you ask Mr Bunbury not to be ill on
Saturday?

351
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:30,980
I am holding a reception and I want you to
organize the music.

352
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:38,210
People talk during performances of music and
I want to encourage them to talk, particularly

353
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:43,580
since it is the end of the London season and
they have nearly run out of things to say.

354
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,880
Algernon: I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta,
if he is still conscious.

355
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,250
I think I can promise you that he will be
well by Saturday.

356
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,039
Of course, the music is a problem.

357
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:04,340
You see, if one plays good music, people don't
listen and if one plays bad music, people

358
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,360
don't talk.

359
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,240
But I will show you the programme of music
I have chosen if you will come into the music

360
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,669
room for a moment.

361
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:13,429
Lady Bracknell: Thank you, Algernon.

362
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:15,179
It is very thoughtful of you.

363
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,610
(Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music
room, Gwendolen remains behind)

364
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,009
Jack: It's been a charming day, Miss Fairfax.

365
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:23,960
Gwendolen: Please don't talk about the weather,
Mr Worthing.

366
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,779
When people talk to me about the weather,
I always feel quite certain they mean something

367
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,720
else and I get nervous.

368
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,929
Jack: I do mean something else.

369
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,809
Gwendolen: I thought so.

370
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:37,909
In fact, I am never wrong.

371
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:43,309
Jack: I would like to talk to you about the
'something else' while Lady Bracknell is out

372
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:44,309
of the room.

373
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:46,630
Gwendolen: Then talk about it quickly.

374
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,139
Mama often comes back into a room suddenly.

375
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:55,790
Jack: (Nervously) Miss Fairfax, ever since
I met you, I have admired you more than any

376
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,830
girl...

377
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,389
I have met ever since...

378
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,509
I met you.

379
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:04,340
Gwendolen: Yes, I am quite well aware of that.

380
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,289
I was always fascinated by you - even before
I met you.

381
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:13,960
(Jack looks at her in amazement) We live in
an age of ideals - any expensive monthly magazine

382
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:21,680
will tell you that - and my ideal has always
been to love someone called Ernest.

383
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,960
When Algernon mentioned he had a friend called
Ernest, I knew I would love you.

384
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,860
Jack: Do you really love me, Gwendolen?

385
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,970
Gwendolen: Very much!

386
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,119
Jack: Darling!

387
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,990
You don't know how happy you have made me.

388
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,029
Gwendolen: My own Ernest!

389
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:41,669
Jack: But could you love me if my name wasn't
Ernest?

390
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:44,080
Gwendolen: But your name is Ernest.

391
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,250
Jack: Yes, I know it is.

392
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,559
But what if it was something else?

393
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,040
Couldn't you love me then?

394
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,279
Gwendolen: (Cleverly) Ah!

395
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,169
But you are called Ernest, so there is no
reason to think about you not being called

396
00:19:58,169 --> 00:19:59,169
Ernest.

397
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:03,500
Jack: Personally, darling, I don't really
like the name Ernest...

398
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,909
I don't think the name suits me.

399
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:07,240
Gwendolen: It suits you perfectly.

400
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,080
It is a wonderful name.

401
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,129
It is musical.

402
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:17,700
Jack: Well, really, Gwendolen, I think there
are a lot of nicer names.

403
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,309
I think that Jack, for instance, is a charming
name.

404
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,539
Gwendolen: Jack...?

405
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:28,820
No, there is very little music in the name
Jack.

406
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,570
It does not excite me.

407
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:36,240
I have known several Jacks and they all were
very ordinary.

408
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,710
I feel pity for any woman who is married to
a man called Jack.

409
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,190
I think the only really good name is Ernest.

410
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,990
Jack: Gwendolen, I must get baptized at once...

411
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,429
I mean we must get married at once.

412
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:52,429
There is no time to lose.

413
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:54,759
Gwendolen: (Shocked) Married, Mr Worthing?

414
00:20:54,759 --> 00:21:01,360
Jack: Well... you know that I love you and
you told me, Miss Fairfax, that you love me.

415
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,840
Gwendolen: I do love you.

416
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,279
But you haven't proposed to me yet.

417
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,980
Nothing has been said about marriage.

418
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,649
Jack: Well... may I propose to you now?

419
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:17,029
Gwendolen: I think that this would be an excellent
time to propose to me.

420
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:21,040
And I will tell you now that I will accept
you so that you aren't worried.

421
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,160
Jack: Gwendolen!

422
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,870
Gwendolen: Yes, Mr Worthing?

423
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,379
What are you going to say to me?

424
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:29,120
Jack: You know what I am going to say to you.

425
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,649
Gwendolen: Yes, but you haven't said it.

426
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:34,600
Jack: Gwendolen, will you marry me?

427
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
(Going down on his knees)

428
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,110
Gwendolen: Yes, of course I will.

429
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,580
You have taken a long time to ask.

430
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,289
I am afraid you have had very little experience
of proposing.

431
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:47,340
Jack: My dear, I have never loved anyone in
the world but you.

432
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,029
Gwendolen: Yes, but men often practise proposing.

433
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:54,649
My brother, Gerald, often proposes to people.

434
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,779
All my friends tell me.

435
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:00,169
What wonderful blue eyes you have, Ernest!

436
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:04,590
They are quite, quite blue.

437
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:09,399
I hope you will always look at me like that,
especially when there are other people in

438
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:10,399
the room.

439
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:12,249
(Lady Bracknell enters)

440
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:15,110
Lady Bracknell: Mr Worthing!

441
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,429
Get up from that position.

442
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:20,370
It is not respectable to behave like that.

443
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,370
Gwendolen: Mama!

444
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,379
(Jack tries to stand up but Gwendolen makes
him stay in a kneeling position) Please go

445
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:25,379
away.

446
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,379
Mr Worthing has not finished yet.

447
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:29,380
Lady Bracknell: Finished what, may I ask?

448
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,179
Gwendolen: I am engaged to be married to Mr
Worthing, Mama.

449
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:34,179
(Jack stands up)

450
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:39,029
Lady Bracknell: Pardon me, you are not engaged
to anyone, Gwendolen.

451
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:45,620
When you are engaged to someone, I, or your
father, will inform you of the fact.

452
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,340
An engagement should come as a surprise to
a young girl.

453
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,080
A pleasant surprise or an unpleasant surprise.

454
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,970
It is not something that she is allowed to
arrange for herself...

455
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:04,529
And now, I have a few questions to ask you,
Mr Worthing.

456
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:09,470
While I am asking these questions, you, Gwendolen,
will wait for me in the carriage.

457
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,470
Gwendolen: Mama!

458
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,120
Lady Bracknell: Wait in the carriage, Gwendolen!

459
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
(Gwendolen goes to the door.

460
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,320
She and Jack kiss their hands and pretend
to blow the kisses to each other behind Lady

461
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Bracknell's back.

462
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
Lady Bracknell looks around for the cause
of the noise.

463
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
Finally she turns round and sees them.

464
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Frowning) Gwendolen, I said wait for me in
the carriage!

465
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,390
Gwendolen: Yes, Mama.

466
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,820
(Going off, looking back at Jack)

467
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,910
Lady Bracknell: You can sit down, Mr Worthing.

468
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,910
(Looks in her pocket for a notebook and pencil)

469
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,860
Jack: Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer
to stand.

470
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,900
Lady Bracknell: (Notebook and pencil in hand)
I must tell you that you are not on my list

471
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,789
of eligible young men, although I have the
same list as the Duchess of Bolton.

472
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:40,669
We work together during the season.

473
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:46,769
However, I am quite ready to add your name
to the list if your answers are satisfactory.

474
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:49,600
Do you smoke?

475
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,029
Jack: Well, yes, I do smoke.

476
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:55,519
Lady Bracknell: I am glad to hear it.

477
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,600
A man should always have an occupation.

478
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,889
There are far too many men in London who don't
have an occupation.

479
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:05,860
How old are you?

480
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,940
Jack: Twenty-nine.

481
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,320
Lady Bracknell: That's a very good age to
get married.

482
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:19,380
I have always believed that a man who wants
to get married should know everything or nothing.

483
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,789
Which do you know?

484
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:25,610
Jack: (After hesitating) I know nothing, Lady
Bracknell.

485
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,760
Lady Bracknell: I am pleased to hear it.

486
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,659
I approve of ignorance.

487
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:32,649
I don't approve of modern education.

488
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:39,080
Fortunately, in England at least, education
has no effect at all.

489
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,389
What is your income?

490
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:43,639
Jack: It's between seven and eight thousand
pounds a year.

491
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:49,190
Lady Bracknell: (Making a note in her book)
Do you earn this income from land that you

492
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,369
own or from investments?

493
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:51,769
Jack: From investments.

494
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:54,960
Lady Bracknell: That is satisfactory.

495
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,639
Owning land is neither profitable nor pleasurable
- it costs money to look after it when one

496
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:04,860
is alive and then there are taxes when one
is dead.

497
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,009
That's all I can say about land.

498
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:12,480
Jack: I have a country house with some land,
but I don't depend upon it for my income.

499
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,100
Lady Bracknell: A country house!

500
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,260
How many bedrooms?

501
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,009
Well, that doesn't matter.

502
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:21,509
I hope you have a house in town.

503
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:23,669
Gwendolen must have a house in town.

504
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:29,850
Jack: Well, I do have a town house in Belgrave
Square but it is rented to Lady Bloxham.

505
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,460
Lady Bracknell: Lady Bloxham?

506
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,059
I don't know her.

507
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:37,860
Jack: Oh, she doesn't go out very much; she's
very old.

508
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,970
Lady Bracknell: She's not necessarily respectable
even if she is old.

509
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,669
What number Belgrave Square?

510
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:45,669
Jack: 149.

511
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:51,080
Lady Bracknell: (Shaking her head disapprovingly)
But that is the unfashionable side of the

512
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
street.

513
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,549
However, that could easily be changed.

514
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:56,600
Jack: Do you mean the fashion or the side?

515
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,490
Lady Bracknell: (Very disapprovingly) Both,
if necessary.

516
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:04,350
Now, let us discuss less important details.

517
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,950
Are your parents living?

518
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,330
Jack: I have lost both my parents.

519
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:16,320
Lady Bracknell: To lose one parent, Mr Worthing,
is unfortunate; to lose both seems like carelessness.

520
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,389
Who was your father?

521
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:21,049
He must have been a wealthy man.

522
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:23,529
Was he a businessman or an aristocrat?

523
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:27,330
Jack: I am afraid I don't know.

524
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,040
Lady Bracknell, I said that I had lost my
parents.

525
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,789
In fact, my parents lost me...

526
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:36,480
I don't know who I am.

527
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,980
I was... well, I was found.

528
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,909
Lady Bracknell: Found?

529
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:49,159
Jack: The late Mr Thomas Cardew, a very kind
and charitable old gentleman, found me and

530
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:55,549
called me 'Worthing' because he had a train
ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time.

531
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:57,749
Worthing is a seaside town.

532
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:04,289
Lady Bracknell: Where did the kind gentleman
who had a train ticket for this seaside town

533
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,480
find you?

534
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,080
Jack: (Seriously) In a handbag.

535
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,529
Lady Bracknell: A handbag?

536
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:13,019
Jack: (Very seriously) Yes, Lady Bracknell.

537
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:20,330
I was in a handbag - a large, black leather
handbag - an ordinary handbag with handles.

538
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,989
Lady Bracknell: Where did Mr Thomas Cardew
find this ordinary handbag?

539
00:27:25,989 --> 00:27:31,509
Jack: In the cloakroom at Victoria Station,
here in London.

540
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:32,870
It was a mistake.

541
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,710
It was given to him instead of his own bag.

542
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,750
Lady Bracknell: In the cloakroom at Victoria
Station?

543
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,070
Jack: Yes.

544
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:49,360
Lady Bracknell: Mr Worthing, I am shocked
by what you have just told me.

545
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,289
I do not think it is right to be born in a
handbag, even if it has handles.

546
00:27:55,289 --> 00:28:02,919
And I do not think it is right to be found
in a handbag in a cloakroom at a railway station.

547
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:08,890
It is not the way to become a respectable
gentleman with a good position in society.

548
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,000
Jack: What is your advice, Lady Bracknell?

549
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,200
I would, of course, do anything to make Gwendolen
happy.

550
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:22,899
Lady Bracknell: My advice to you, Mr Worthing,
is this - try to find some relations as soon

551
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:24,539
as possible.

552
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,559
And try to find at least one parent.

553
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:32,409
Jack: Well, I don't see how I could possibly
do that.

554
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:35,389
I can show you the handbag.

555
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:37,629
It is in a wardrobe at home.

556
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:40,690
I really think that should satisfy you, Lady
Bracknell.

557
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,400
Lady Bracknell: Me, sir!

558
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,580
It has nothing to do with me!

559
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:52,600
Do you really think that Lord Bracknell would
allow our only daughter to marry the son of

560
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,070
a cloakroom and form a relationship with a
piece of luggage?

561
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,509
Goodbye, Mr Worthing!

562
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:04,379
(Lady Bracknell leaves the room with great
dignity)

563
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:05,600
Jack: Goodbye!

564
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,289
(Algernon starts singing a Wedding March in
the music room.

565
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:14,630
Jack looks very angry and goes to the door)
Stop singing that awful tune, Algy!

566
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,509
(The singing stops and Algernon enters cheerfully)

567
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:19,440
Algernon: Didn't everything work out all right,
old fellow?

568
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,049
Did Gwendolen refuse to marry you?

569
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:24,059
Jack: Oh, Gwendolen was fine.

570
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,539
She believes we are engaged.

571
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:28,239
Her mother is awful.

572
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:30,759
I've never met such a monster.

573
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:36,100
Oh, I beg your pardon, Algy, I suppose I shouldn't
talk about your own aunt in that way in front

574
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
of you.

575
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,520
Algernon: My dear fellow, I love hearing people
being rude about my relations.

576
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,590
Relations are simply a boring group of people
who don't know how to live and don't know

577
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,590
when to die.

578
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,990
Jack: Oh, that is nonsense!

579
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,169
Algernon: It isn't!

580
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:53,860
Jack: Well, I won't argue about it.

581
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,950
You always want to argue about things.

582
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,200
Algernon: Things were made for arguing about.

583
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,590
Jack: If I believed that, I'd shoot myself...

584
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:07,789
(A pause) You don't think Gwendolen will become
like her mother in a hundred and fifty years,

585
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:08,789
do you, Algy?

586
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:12,059
Algernon: All women become like their mothers.

587
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:13,999
That is their tragedy.

588
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:17,059
No men become like theirs.

589
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,509
That is their tragedy.

590
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:21,049
Jack: Have you said something clever?

591
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:25,210
Algernon: They were very fine sentences and
they are very true.

592
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,999
Jack: I'm tired of cleverness.

593
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:30,129
Everybody is clever nowadays.

594
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,350
You meet clever people everywhere.

595
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,059
I wish that there were a few fools left in
the world.

596
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:36,379
Algernon: There are.

597
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:37,970
Jack: I should like to meet them.

598
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,369
What do they talk about?

599
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:41,179
Algernon: The fools?

600
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:43,570
They talk about the clever people, of course.

601
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,740
Jack: What fools!

602
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:50,789
Algernon: By the way, did you tell Gwendolen
the truth about being Ernest in town and Jack

603
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:51,789
in the country?

604
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:58,899
Jack: My dear fellow, one does not tell the
truth to a nice, sweet girl.

605
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:02,359
You have extraordinary ideas about how to
behave to a woman!

606
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:07,460
Algernon: The only way to behave to a woman
is to flirt with her if she is pretty.

607
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,710
And if she isn't pretty, you must flirt with
someone else.

608
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,340
Jack: Oh, that is nonsense.

609
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:17,860
Algernon: What about your badly behaved brother
Ernest?

610
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,249
Did you tell her about him?

611
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:22,850
Jack: Oh, I shall have got rid of him before
the end of the week.

612
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,210
I'll say he died in Paris of a heart attack.

613
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:29,750
Lots of people die of a heart attack quite
suddenly, don't they?

614
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,149
Algernon: Yes, but it's hereditary, my dear
fellow.

615
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:36,029
It's the sort of thing that runs in families.

616
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:39,340
You had better say that he died of a bad cold.

617
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,429
Jack: Are you sure that a bad cold isn't hereditary?

618
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:43,929
Algernon: Of course it isn't.

619
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:45,369
Jack: Very well, then.

620
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:51,429
My poor brother Ernest will die suddenly,
in Paris, of a bad cold.

621
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:53,009
That gets rid of him.

622
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:55,440
Algernon: But you said that your ward...

623
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,580
Miss Cardew... was a little too interested
in your poor brother Ernest.

624
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,710
Won't she be very distressed?

625
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,649
Jack: Oh, that's not a problem.

626
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:11,169
Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am
pleased to say.

627
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:16,510
She eats big meals, goes for long walks and
doesn't pay attention to her lessons.

628
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,529
Algernon: I would like to meet Cecily.

629
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:22,409
Jack: I will make sure that you never meet
her.

630
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:25,980
She is extremely pretty and she is just eighteen.

631
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:31,140
Algernon: Have you told Gwendolen that you
have an extremely pretty ward who is just

632
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,140
eighteen?

633
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,549
Jack: Oh, one mustn't tell people everything
all at once.

634
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:40,059
Cecily and Gwendolen will be great friends,
I'm sure.

635
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,549
They will be calling each other sister half
an hour after they meet.

636
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:47,710
Algernon: Women only call each other sister
after they have called each other lots of

637
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,289
other things first.

638
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:54,730
Now, my dear fellow, if we want to get a good
table at the restaurant, we must go and change

639
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,580
our clothes now.

640
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,580
It's nearly seven.

641
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,580
I'm hungry.

642
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,830
Jack: (Irritably) I never knew a time when
you weren't hungry.

643
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,659
Algernon: What shall we do after dinner?

644
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:04,720
Go to a theatre?

645
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,010
Jack: Oh no!

646
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,859
One has to listen at the theatre.

647
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:08,859
I hate listening.

648
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:11,059
Algernon: Well, let us go to the Club.

649
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:12,399
Jack: Oh no!

650
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,320
One has to talk at the Club.

651
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
I hate talking.

652
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,809
Algernon: Well, we could go to the Empire
Music Hall at ten. 

653
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:20,379
Jack: The Music Hall?

654
00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:21,570
Oh no!

655
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,899
I hate looking at things.

656
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:25,950
Algernon: Well, what shall we do?

657
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,049
Jack: Nothing!

658
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:30,850
Algernon: Doing nothing is very hard work.

659
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:36,929
However, I don't mind very hard work if there
is nothing definite to do.

660
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:37,929
(Lane enters)

661
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:40,509
Lane: Miss Fairfax has returned, sir.

662
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:41,509
(Gwendolen enters.

663
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:42,509
Lane goes off)

664
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:43,509
Algernon: Gwendolen.

665
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:44,509
Hello!

666
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:45,509
Gwendolen: Algy, please go away.

667
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:49,470
I have something which I want to say to Mr
Worthing in private.

668
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,859
Algernon: Really, Gwendolen.

669
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:53,789
I don't think I can allow you to do that.

670
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:57,049
Gwendolen: Algy, you are not quite old enough
to say things like that.

671
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:58,049
(Algernon goes to the other side of the room
near the fireplace and stands with his back

672
00:33:58,049 --> 00:33:59,049
to them)

673
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:01,230
Jack: My own darling!

674
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,570
Gwendolen: Ernest, we may never be married.

675
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,980
I saw the frown on Mama's face.

676
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,590
Few parents these days pay attention to what
their children say to them.

677
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:17,860
I was three years old the last time I had
any influence over my mother.

678
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,070
Ernest, she may stop us from getting married.

679
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:28,410
I may get married to someone else, I may get
married again and again - but nothing will

680
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:30,440
ever change my love for you.

681
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,210
Jack: Dear Gwendolen!

682
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,500
Gwendolen: Mama told me the romantic story
of your birth.

683
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,870
She is displeased about it, but I love it.

684
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,160
Your name - Ernest - fascinates me.

685
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:49,910
You are so simple and good-natured and that
makes you wonderfully complicated.

686
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:53,680
I've got your town address at The Albany.

687
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,420
What is your address in the country?

688
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,340
Jack: The Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.

689
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,950
(Algernon, who has turned round and has been
carefully listening, smiles to himself and

690
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,950
writes the address on the cuff of his shirt.

691
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:02,950
Then he picks up a railway timetable from
a shelf)

692
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,140
Gwendolen: It may be necessary to do something
impetuous.

693
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,780
We will have to think carefully about this.

694
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,770
I will write to you every day.

695
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,490
Jack: My own one!

696
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,210
Gwendolen: How long will you be in town?

697
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,490
Jack: Till Monday.

698
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,050
Gwendolen: Good!

699
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,220
Algy, you may turn round now.

700
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,020
Algernon: Thanks, I have turned round already.

701
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,360
Gwendolen: You may also ring the bell for
Lane to take me to the door.

702
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,680
(Algernon rings the bell)

703
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,990
Jack: Let me take you to the door, my own
darling.

704
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,990
Gwendolen: Certainly.

705
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,950
Jack: (To Lane, who now enters) I will take
Miss Fairfax to the door.

706
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,950
Lane: Yes, sir.

707
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,980
(Jack and Gwendolen go off)

708
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,540
Algernon: Bring me a glass of wine, Lane.

709
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,280
Lane: Yes, sir.

710
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,380
Algernon: Tomorrow, Lane, I'm going Bunburying.

711
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,990
Lane: Yes, sir.

712
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,140
Algernon: I shall probably not be back till
Monday.

713
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:51,350
Pack my evening clothes, some casual clothes
and all my Bunbury suits...

714
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,350
Lane: Yes, sir.

715
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,350
(Handing Algernon his glass of wine)

716
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,530
Algernon: I hope that tomorrow is a fine day,
Lane.

717
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,680
Lane: It never is, sir.

718
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,820
Algernon: Lane, you are a pessimist.

719
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,580
Lane: I do my best, sir.

720
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,580
(Jack enters.

721
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,580
Lane goes off)

722
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,600
Jack: What a sensible, intelligent girl!

723
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,111
The only girl I've ever cared for in my life.

724
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:13,280
(Algernon is laughing loudly) What on earth
are you laughing at?

725
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,210
Algernon: Oh, I'm a bit worried about poor
Bunbury, that is all.

726
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:22,670
Jack: Your friend Bunbury will get you into
trouble one day, you know.

727
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,580
Algernon: I love trouble.

728
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,190
It's the only thing which is never serious.

729
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,380
Jack: Oh, that's nonsense, Algy.

730
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,050
You never talk anything but nonsense.

731
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,050
Algernon: Nobody ever does.

732
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,220
(Jack shakes his head at him and leaves the
room.

733
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:43,370
Algernon lights a cigarette, looks at his
shirt-cuff and smiles)

734
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,370
ACT TWO

735
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,020
(The garden at the Manor House in Woolton,
Hertfordshire, Jack Worthing's country home.

736
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,880
Miss Prism is sitting at a table.

737
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,940
Cecily is watering flowers)

738
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,270
Miss Prism: (Calling) Cecily, Cecily!

739
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:55,810
I think that watering flowers is a servant's
occupation rather than yours, especially at

740
00:36:55,810 --> 00:37:00,170
a moment when the pleasures of education are
waiting for you.

741
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,150
Your German grammar book is on the table.

742
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,150
Please open it at page fifteen.

743
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,020
We will do yesterday's lesson again.

744
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,550
Cecily: (Coming over to the table very slowly)
But I don't like German.

745
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,110
It isn't a very pretty language.

746
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,590
I know that I look quite ugly after my German
lesson.

747
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:23,180
Miss Prism: Child, your guardian is anxious
that you improve yourself in every way.

748
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:29,550
As he was leaving for town yesterday, he reminded
me how important your German is.

749
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:35,080
Indeed he always reminds me how important
your German is when he is leaving for town.

750
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,730
Cecily: Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious!

751
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:42,600
Sometimes he is so serious that I think he
must be ill.

752
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,280
Miss Prism: (Sitting up very straight in her
chair) Your guardian's health is excellent

753
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:54,010
and his seriousness - indeed his earnestness
- is very admirable in such a young man.

754
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:59,470
I do not know anyone else who has such a good
sense of duty and responsibility.

755
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:05,360
Cecily: I suppose that is why he often seems
a little bored when we three are together.

756
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,740
Miss Prism: Cecily!

757
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,050
I am surprised at you.

758
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,120
Mr Worthing has many troubles in his life.

759
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:18,501
You must remember that he is always worried
about that unfortunate young man, his brother

760
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:19,501
Ernest.

761
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:26,460
Cecily: I wish Uncle Jack would allow that
unfortunate young man, his brother Ernest,

762
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,500
to come here sometimes.

763
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,490
We might have a good influence on him, Miss
Prism.

764
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,730
I am sure that you would.

765
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:39,570
You know German and geology and all kinds
of things that influence a man very much.

766
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,720
(Cecily begins to write in her diary)

767
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,210
Miss Prism: (Shaking her head) I do not think
that even I could have a good influence on

768
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,490
his character.

769
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:52,300
Mr Worthing himself says that his brother's
character is weak and indecisive.

770
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:56,760
Indeed, I wouldn't want to have a good influence
on him.

771
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,920
I do not approve of this modern desire to
turn bad people into good people at a moment's

772
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,920
notice.

773
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,420
I think he should suffer because of his misbehaviour.

774
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,790
You must put away your diary, Cecily.

775
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,830
I really don't understand why you keep a diary
at all.

776
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:19,510
Cecily: I keep a diary in order to write down
the wonderful secrets of my life.

777
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,420
If I didn't write them down, I should probably
forget all about them.

778
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:28,260
Miss Prism: Our memory is the diary that we
all have with us.

779
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:36,020
Cecily: Yes, but our memory usually remembers
things that have never happened and couldn't

780
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,020
possibly have happened.

781
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:42,360
I believe that memory is responsible for all
the three-volume novels people write.

782
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,320
Miss Prism: Do not be dismissive of the three-volume
novel, Cecily.

783
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,780
I wrote one myself a long time ago.

784
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,360
Cecily: Did you really, Miss Prism?

785
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,680
How wonderfully clever you are!

786
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,780
I hope it did not end happily!

787
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,520
I don't like novels that end happily.

788
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,610
They depress me so much.

789
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:06,980
Miss Prism: The good people ended happily.

790
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,590
The bad people ended unhappily.

791
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,640
That is fiction.

792
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,420
Cecily: I suppose so.

793
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,680
But it seems very unfair.

794
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,850
And was your novel ever published?

795
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,920
Miss Prism: I am sad to say it was not.

796
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,320
The manuscript, unfortunately, was lost.

797
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,020
Now, start work, child.

798
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,110
There is no point in thinking about these
things.

799
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:36,600
Cecily: (Smiling) But I see dear Canon Chasuble
coming towards us through the garden.

800
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,880
Miss Prism: (Standing up and going towards
Canon Chasuble) Canon Chasuble!

801
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,080
It is indeed a pleasure to see you.

802
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,270
Chasuble: And how are we today?

803
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,690
Miss Prism, you are, I hope, well?

804
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,480
Cecily: Miss Prism has just been complaining
of a slight headache.

805
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,920
I think that it would do her good to have
a short walk with you in the park, Canon Chasuble.

806
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,410
Miss Prism: Cecily, I have not mentioned anything
about a headache.

807
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:09,110
Cecily: No, dear Miss Prism, I know that,
but I felt that you had a headache.

808
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:15,850
Indeed, I was thinking about that, and not
about my German lesson, when Canon Chasuble

809
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,850
arrived.

810
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,250
Chasuble: I hope, Cecily, that you pay attention
to your lessons.

811
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,140
Cecily: Oh, I am afraid I do not!

812
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,640
Chasuble: That is strange.

813
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,670
If I were Miss Prism's pupil, I would always
pay attention.

814
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,350
Has Mr Worthing returned from town yet?

815
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,500
Miss Prism: We expect him on Monday afternoon.

816
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,770
Chasuble: Ah, yes, he usually likes to spend
his Sundays in London.

817
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:47,990
He is an earnest young man who does not always
look for pleasure as, I believe, his younger

818
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,270
brother does.

819
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:53,150
I will see you both at church later, shall
I?

820
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:59,070
Miss Prism: I think, dear Canon, I will have
a walk with you.

821
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:03,890
I find I have a headache after all and a walk
might do it good.

822
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:08,780
Canon Chasuble: It would be a pleasure, Miss
Prism, a pleasure.

823
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,470
Let us go to the end of the garden and back.

824
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,870
Miss Prism: That would be delightful.

825
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:19,510
Cecily, you will read your Political Economy
in my absence.

826
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,040
(Miss Prism goes down the garden with Canon
Chasuble)

827
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,350
Cecily: Oh horrid Political Economy!

828
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,350
Horrid German!

829
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,010
(Merriman enters with a visiting card on a
silver tray)

830
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,690
Merriman: Mr Ernest Worthing has just arrived
from the station.

831
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,980
He has brought his luggage with him.

832
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:38,410
Cecily: (Taking the card and reading it) 'Mr
Ernest Worthing, B.4, The Albany, London.'

833
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,590
He must be Uncle Jack's brother!

834
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,810
Have you told him Uncle Jack is in town?

835
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,310
Merriman: Yes, miss.

836
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,390
He seemed very disappointed.

837
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:52,210
I told him that you and Miss Prism were in
the garden.

838
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,440
He said he was anxious to speak to you privately
for a moment.

839
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,480
Cecily: Ask Mr Ernest Worthing to come here.

840
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,850
And you had better talk to the housekeeper
about a bedroom for him.

841
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,300
Merriman: Yes, miss.

842
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,750
(Merriman goes off)

843
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:08,820
Cecily: (To herself) I have never met a really
wicked person before.

844
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,810
I feel rather frightened.

845
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:15,050
I am so afraid that he will look just like
everyone else.

846
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,390
(Algernon enters looking very handsome and
fashionable) Oh dear, he does!

847
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:22,090
Algernon: (Raising his hat) You are my little
cousin, Cecily, I'm sure.

848
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,940
Cecily: You are making a strange mistake.

849
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,550
I am not little.

850
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:29,770
In fact, I believe I am quite tall for my
age.

851
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:34,090
(Algernon is rather surprised) But I am your
cousin, Cecily.

852
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:41,880
You, I see from your card, are Uncle Jack's
brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin

853
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
Ernest.

854
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,880
Algernon: Oh!

855
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,120
I am not really wicked at all, Cousin Cecily.

856
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,650
You mustn't think that I am wicked.

857
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:55,440
Cecily: If you are not wicked, then I think
you have been deceiving us all.

858
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,810
I hope that you have not been leading a double
life.

859
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:04,790
I hope you have not been pretending to be
wicked and being really good all the time.

860
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,500
That would be hypocrisy.

861
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,690
Algernon: (Looking at her in amazement) Oh!

862
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:13,410
Of course, I have been rather bad.

863
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,740
Cecily: I'm glad to hear it.

864
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:20,950
Algernon: In fact, I think that I have been
very wicked in my own way.

865
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:27,210
Cecily: I don't think you should be so proud
of that, though I'm sure it must have been

866
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,210
very pleasant.

867
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,740
Algernon: It is much pleasanter being here
with you.

868
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,640
Cecily: I can't understand why you are here
at all.

869
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,030
Uncle Jack won't be back from town till Monday
afternoon.

870
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,820
Algernon: That is a great disappointment to
me.

871
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,020
I have to leave for London by the first train
on Monday morning.

872
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,950
I have a business meeting that I am anxious...
to miss!

873
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:53,190
Cecily: Couldn't you miss it anywhere but
in London?

874
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,190
Algernon: No.

875
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,160
The appointment is in London.

876
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:03,060
Cecily: Well, of course, I know that it is
important not to attend a business meeting.

877
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,380
That is what makes life interesting.

878
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,720
But I think you should wait till Uncle Jack
arrives.

879
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,120
I know he wants to speak to you about your
emigration.

880
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,270
Algernon: He wants to speak to me about...

881
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:17,500
I don't understand!

882
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,570
Cecily: About your emigration.

883
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:22,810
He has gone to town to buy your clothes.

884
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:26,890
Algernon: I certainly wouldn't let Jack buy
my clothes.

885
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,810
He has no taste in ties at all.

886
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,990
Cecily: I don't think you will require ties.

887
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,830
Uncle Jack is sending you to Australia.

888
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,450
Algernon: Australia!

889
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,890
I'd rather die.

890
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:45,290
Cecily: Well, at dinner on Wednesday he said
that you would have to choose between this

891
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:47,770
world, the next world and Australia.

892
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,610
Algernon: Oh well!

893
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:53,580
I don't believe Australia and the next world
are very nice.

894
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,250
This world is good enough for me, Cousin Cecily.

895
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,410
Cecily: Ah, but are you good enough for it?

896
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:02,290
Algernon: I'm afraid I'm not.

897
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:06,510
That is why I want you to reform me.

898
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,490
Please will you do this, Cousin Cecily.

899
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,970
Cecily: I'm afraid I don't have time this
afternoon.

900
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:16,540
Algernon: Well, would you mind if I reformed
myself this afternoon?

901
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,830
Cecily: It is rather ambitious of you.

902
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:20,060
But I think you should try.

903
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,150
Algernon: I will.

904
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,840
I feel better already.

905
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,320
Cecily: You are looking a little worse.

906
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,780
Algernon: That is because I am hungry.

907
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,930
Cecily: How thoughtless of me.

908
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:37,980
I should have remembered that someone who
is going to reform himself needs regular meals.

909
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,010
Please come in.

910
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:40,480
Algernon: Thank you.

911
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,170
May I have a flower for my buttonhole first?

912
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:49,030
I never have any appetite unless I have a
flower for my buttonhole.

913
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,430
I'd like a pink rose.

914
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,780
Cecily: (Picking up scissors) Why?

915
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,780
(Cutting a flower)

916
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,970
Algernon: Because you are like a pink rose,
Cousin Cecily.

917
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:01,890
Cecily: I don't think that it is right for
you to talk to me like that.

918
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:04,640
Miss Prism doesn't say such things to me.

919
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,270
Algernon: Miss Prism must be a very short-sighted
old lady.

920
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:12,320
(Cecily puts the flower in his buttonhole)
You are the prettiest girl I have ever seen.

921
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,940
Cecily: Miss Prism says that good looks are
a trap.

922
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:21,300
Algernon: They are a trap that every sensible
man would like to be caught in.

923
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,100
Cecily: Oh, I don't think I would like to
catch a sensible man.

924
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,730
I wouldn't know what to talk to him about.

925
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:28,800
(They go into the house.

926
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,090
Miss Prism and Canon Chasuble enter)

927
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:34,170
Miss Prism: You are on your own too much,
Canon Chasuble.

928
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:35,250
You should get married.

929
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:39,220
Chasuble: The Early Church was very much against
marriage.

930
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:44,800
Miss Prism: That is obviously the reason why
the Early Church has not lasted to the present

931
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,100
day.

932
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:53,050
And you do not seem to realize, dear sir,
that a man who remains single becomes a permanent

933
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,050
temptation.

934
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:58,180
Chasuble: But isn't a man equally attractive
when he is married?

935
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:03,010
Miss Prism: No married man is ever attractive
except to his wife.

936
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,610
Chasuble: And often, I've been told, he is
not even attractive to her.

937
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,510
Miss Prism: That depends on the woman.

938
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:15,180
If she is a mature woman, she can be relied
upon.

939
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,990
You cannot rely upon a young woman.

940
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:20,710
But where is Cecily?

941
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,470
Chasuble: Perhaps she followed us.

942
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,110
(Jack enters from the back of the garden.

943
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,340
He is wearing black mourning clothes)

944
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,680
Miss Prism: Mr Worthing!

945
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,010
Chasuble: Mr Worthing!

946
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,380
Miss Prism: This is a surprise.

947
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,720
We did not expect you till Monday afternoon.

948
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,090
Jack: (Shaking Miss Prism's hand in a tragic
way) I have returned sooner than I expected

949
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,460
to.

950
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,910
Canon Chasuble, I hope you are well?

951
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:46,120
Chasuble: Dear Mr Worthing, I hope these black
clothes do not mean that something dreadful

952
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
has happened?

953
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,330
Jack: My brother.

954
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:52,030
Miss Prism: More shameful debts and bad behaviour?

955
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:55,340
Chasuble: Is he still leading his wicked life?

956
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,590
Jack: (Shaking his head) Dead!

957
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,090
Chasuble: Your brother Ernest is dead?

958
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,690
Jack: Quite dead.

959
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:05,330
Miss Prism: What a lesson for him!

960
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,480
I hope he will learn from this.

961
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,720
Chasuble: Mr Worthing, I offer you my sincere
condolences.

962
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:18,390
At least you know that you have always been
most generous and forgiving to him.

963
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,950
Jack: Poor Ernest!

964
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:23,090
He had many faults, but it is very, very sad.

965
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:27,610
Chasuble: Very sad indeed.

966
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:29,760
Were you with him at the end?

967
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,960
Jack: No.

968
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,810
He died abroad; in Paris, in fact.

969
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:38,940
I had a telegram last night from the manager
of the Grand Hotel in Paris.

970
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,380
Chasuble: Did the telegram mention the cause
of death?

971
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,380
Jack: A bad cold, it seems.

972
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:49,560
Miss Prism: As a man sows, so shall he reap.

973
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,670
Chasuble: Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity!

974
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,920
None of us are perfect.

975
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,770
I myself am particularly sensitive to draughts.

976
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:02,380
Will the funeral take place here?

977
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,610
Jack: No.

978
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:05,970
It seems he wanted to be buried in Paris.

979
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,410
Chasuble: In Paris!

980
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:14,110
(Shaking his head) I don't think he was being
very serious even at the end.

981
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:18,330
You will want me to mention this sad event
in church next Sunday.

982
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:21,080
(Jack presses Canon Chasuble's hand very hard
and looks very sad) My sermon on the mercy

983
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:26,080
of God can be used on any occasion, happy
or sad.

984
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:32,940
(They all sigh) I have preached it at baptisms,
weddings and funerals.

985
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:39,210
The last time I preached it was to the Society
for the Prevention of Discontent among the

986
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,530
Upper Classes.

987
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:45,210
The Bishop, who was present, liked it very
much.

988
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,440
Jack: Ah!

989
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,610
That reminds me.

990
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:51,130
You mentioned baptisms, I think, Canon Chasuble?

991
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,580
You know how to baptize people, I suppose?

992
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:57,320
(Canon Chasuble looks very surprised) I mean
you often baptize people, don't you?

993
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,440
Miss Prism: It is, I am sorry to say, one
of the canon's most frequent duties.

994
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,360
I have often spoken to the poorer classes
about it.

995
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,150
But they don't take any notice.

996
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:13,080
Chasuble: But is there any particular child
in whom you are interested, Mr Worthing?

997
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,710
Your brother was, I believe, unmarried?

998
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,910
Jack: Oh yes.

999
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,550
Miss Prism: (Bitterly) People who live just
for pleasure are usually unmarried.

1000
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:25,330
Jack: But it is not for any child, dear canon.

1001
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:26,330
No!

1002
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:31,370
The fact is that I would like to be baptized
myself, this afternoon, if you have nothing

1003
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:32,470
better to do.

1004
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:36,930
Chasuble: But surely, Mr Worthing, you have
been baptized already?

1005
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:40,370
Jack: I don't remember anything about it.

1006
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:44,690
Of course, I don't know if you think I am
a little too old now.

1007
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,840
Chasuble: Not at all.

1008
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:50,020
At what time would you like the ceremony performed?

1009
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:54,650
Jack: Oh, I'll come about five o'clock if
that would suit you.

1010
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,540
Chasuble: Perfectly, perfectly!

1011
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:03,190
In fact I have two similar ceremonies to perform
at that time - twins who were born in one

1012
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,110
of the cottages on your estate.

1013
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:06,120
Jack: Oh!

1014
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,640
I don't think it would be much fun to be baptized
along with other babies.

1015
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,090
It would be childish.

1016
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,170
Would half-past five be all right?

1017
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,170
Chasuble: Of course, of course!

1018
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:19,890
(Taking out his watch from his pocket) And
now, dear Mr Worthing, I will not stay any

1019
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:23,060
longer in this house of grief.

1020
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,540
I ask you not to grieve too much.

1021
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,410
Bitter trials are often blessings in disguise.

1022
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:33,400
Miss Prism: This seems to me to be an extremely
obvious blessing.

1023
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,400
(Cecily enters from the house)

1024
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,400
Cecily: Uncle Jack!

1025
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,460
Oh, I am pleased to see you.

1026
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:42,980
But what horrible clothes you are wearing.

1027
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,340
Please go and change them.

1028
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,340
Miss Prism: Cecily!

1029
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,340
Chasuble: My child!

1030
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,340
My child!

1031
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,940
(Cecily goes towards Jack, who kisses her
forehead in a tragic way)

1032
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,700
Cecily: What is the matter, Uncle Jack?

1033
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,880
Please look happy!

1034
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,610
You look as if you have toothache, and I have
got such a surprise for you.

1035
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:01,240
Who do you think is in the dining room?

1036
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,240
Your brother!

1037
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,240
Jack: Who?

1038
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,840
Cecily: Your brother Ernest.

1039
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,990
He arrived about half an hour ago.

1040
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,350
Jack: What nonsense!

1041
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,550
I haven't got a brother.

1042
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,170
Cecily: Oh, don't say that.

1043
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:16,740
He is still your brother even though he has
behaved badly in the past.

1044
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,310
You mustn't be so heartless.

1045
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:20,240
I'll tell him to come out.

1046
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,480
And you will shake hands with him, won't you,
Uncle Jack?

1047
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,150
(Cecily runs back into the house)

1048
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:27,460
Chasuble: This is very happy news.

1049
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:33,130
Miss Prism: Since we were just getting used
to his departure, his sudden return seems

1050
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:34,250
very distressing.

1051
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:38,220
Jack: My brother is in the dining room?

1052
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,690
I don't know what it means.

1053
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,180
I think it is perfectly ridiculous.

1054
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,330
(Algernon and Cecily enter holding hands.

1055
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,330
They come slowly towards Jack)

1056
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:45,330
Good heavens!

1057
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,790
(He waves his hand to try to make Algernon
go away)

1058
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:50,840
Algernon: (Holding his hand out to Jack) Brother
Jack, I have come from town to tell you that

1059
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:57,800
I am very sorry for all the trouble I have
given you and that I will behave myself better

1060
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,800
in future.

1061
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,290
(Jack glares at him and doesn't take his hand)

1062
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:04,790
Cecily: Uncle Jack, are you going to refuse
to shake your brother's hand?

1063
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:08,780
Jack: Nothing will make me shake his hand.

1064
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,040
I think it is disgraceful that he has come
here.

1065
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,530
He knows perfectly well why.

1066
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:17,800
Cecily: Uncle Jack, do be nice.

1067
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,240
There is some good in everyone.

1068
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:27,190
Ernest has just been telling me about his
poor invalid friend, Mr Bunbury, whom he goes

1069
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:28,860
to visit very often.

1070
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:34,640
There must be much good in Ernest if he leaves
London to sit by the bed of an invalid.

1071
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,010
Jack: Oh!

1072
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,740
He has been talking about Bunbury, has he?

1073
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:45,280
Cecily: Yes, he has told me all about poor
Mr Bunbury and his very bad health.

1074
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,450
Jack: Bunbury!

1075
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:51,230
Well, I don't want him to talk to you about
Bunbury or about anything else.

1076
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,130
It makes me furious.

1077
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:57,810
Algernon: Of course, I agree that I used to
behave very badly.

1078
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:04,030
But I must say that I think Brother Jack's
coldness towards me is very unkind.

1079
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:09,170
I expected a better welcome, especially since
it is the first time I have come here.

1080
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:16,460
Cecily: Uncle Jack, if you don't shake hands
with Ernest, I will never forgive you.

1081
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,310
Jack: You will never forgive me?

1082
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:22,110
Cecily: Never, never, never!

1083
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:27,260
Jack: Well, this is the last time I shall
ever do it.

1084
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,050
(Shaking hands with Algernon and glaring at
him)

1085
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:34,270
Chasuble: It is pleasant to see a perfect
reconciliation, is it not?

1086
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:36,860
I think we should leave the brothers together.

1087
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,820
Miss Prism: Cecily, you will come with us.

1088
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,540
Cecily: Certainly, Miss Prism.

1089
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,120
My task of reconciliation is over.

1090
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,120
Chasuble: You have done something beautiful
today, dear child.

1091
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:58,590
Miss Prism: We must not say these things too
soon.

1092
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:18,760
Cecily: I feel very happy.

1093
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:51,030
(They all go off except Jack and Algernon)

1094
00:56:51,030 --> 00:57:01,180
Jack: You young scoundrel, Algy, you must
get out of this place as soon as possible.

1095
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:04,160
I don't allow any Bunburying here.

1096
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,160
(Merriman enters)

1097
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,840
Merriman: I have put Mr Ernest's things in
the room next to yours, sir.

1098
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,840
Jack: What?

1099
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,020
Merriman: Mr Ernest's luggage, sir.

1100
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:15,910
I have unpacked it and put it in the room
next to your own.

1101
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,280
Jack: His luggage?

1102
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,240
Merriman: Yes, sir.

1103
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:26,960
Three large suitcases, a small suitcase, two
hat boxes and a large picnic basket.

1104
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,750
Algernon: I'm afraid I can only stay for a
week this time.

1105
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:34,110
Jack: Merriman, order the carriage at once.

1106
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:37,210
Mr Ernest has suddenly been called back to
town.

1107
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:38,210
Merriman: Yes, sir.

1108
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,210
(Merriman goes off)

1109
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:40,980
Algernon: What a liar you are, Jack.

1110
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,510
I have not been called back to town at all.

1111
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:44,910
Jack: Yes, you have.

1112
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,040
Algernon: I haven't heard anyone call me.

1113
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,160
Jack: Your duty as a gentleman calls you back.

1114
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,210
Algernon: My duty as a gentleman has never
interfered with my pleasure at all.

1115
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,970
Jack: Yes, I quite understand that!

1116
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:01,350
Algernon: Well, Cecily is a darling.

1117
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:05,200
Jack: You are not to talk of Miss Cardew like
that.

1118
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,460
I don't like it.

1119
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,180
Algernon: Well, I don't like your clothes.

1120
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,240
You look perfectly ridiculous in them.

1121
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,390
Why don't you go upstairs and change?

1122
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:18,850
It is perfectly childish to be wearing black
clothes for a man who is going to stay in

1123
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:21,380
your house for a whole week as a guest.

1124
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:25,390
Jack: You are certainly not staying with me
for a whole week.

1125
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,320
You have got to leave... by the four o'clock
train.

1126
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,450
Algernon: I certainly won't leave you while
you are in black clothes.

1127
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:33,820
That would be very unfriendly.

1128
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,330
Jack: Well, will you go if I change my clothes?

1129
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:40,990
Algernon: Yes, if you are not too long.

1130
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:47,620
I never saw anybody else who took so long
to get dressed, and with such uninteresting

1131
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,620
results.

1132
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:52,960
Jack: Well, at least that is better than always
being overdressed like you.

1133
00:58:52,960 --> 00:59:00,810
Algernon: If I am occasionally overdressed,
I make up for it by being extremely overeducated.

1134
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:07,740
Jack: Your vanity is silly, your behaviour
is outrageous and your presence in my garden

1135
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,600
is ridiculous.

1136
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:15,310
However, you have got to catch the four o'clock
train and I hope you will have a pleasant

1137
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:17,140
journey back to town.

1138
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,620
This Bunburying has not been a success for
you.

1139
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,620
(Jack goes into the house)

1140
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:24,800
Algernon: (To himself) I think it has been
a great success.

1141
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:29,760
I'm in love with Cecily and that is wonderful.

1142
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,960
(Cecily enters at the back of the garden.

1143
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,710
She picks up a can and starts watering the
flowers)

1144
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:39,650
But I must see her before I go and make arrangements
for some more Bunburying.

1145
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,050
Ah, there she is.

1146
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:44,550
Cecily: Oh, I came back to water the roses.

1147
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,880
I thought you were with Uncle Jack.

1148
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,490
Algernon: He's gone to order the carriage
for me.

1149
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:52,710
Cecily: Oh, is he going to take you for a
nice drive?

1150
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:54,910
Algernon: He's going to send me away.

1151
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:56,730
Cecily: Then we have to part?

1152
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:58,970
Algernon: I am afraid so.

1153
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,670
It's a very painful parting.

1154
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:04,420
Cecily: It is always painful to part with
new friends.

1155
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:09,780
It is easy to bear the absence of old friends,
but even a short parting from someone whom

1156
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,040
one has just met is extremely painful.

1157
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,400
Algernon: Thank you.

1158
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,400
(Merriman enters)

1159
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,980
Merriman: The carriage is at the door, sir.

1160
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,500
(Algernon looks sadly at Cecily)

1161
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,530
Cecily: It can wait, Merriman... for... five
minutes.

1162
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,040
Merriman: Yes, miss.

1163
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,550
(Merriman goes off)

1164
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:33,930
Algernon: I hope, Cecily, I shall not offend
you if I tell you that you seem to me to be

1165
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,120
perfect in every way.

1166
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:39,970
Cecily: I think that it is very good that
you are so honest.

1167
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:43,750
If you will allow me, I will copy your words
into my diary.

1168
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,780
(Going over to a table and starting to write
in her diary)

1169
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,750
Algernon: Do you really keep a diary?

1170
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:51,050
I'd love to look at it.

1171
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,590
May I look at it?

1172
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,590
Cecily: Oh, no.

1173
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:59,380
(Putting her hand over it) You see, it is
just a young girl's record of her thoughts

1174
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:03,160
and impressions, and of course, it is going
to be published.

1175
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,010
When it appears in the form of a book, I hope
you will buy a copy.

1176
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,950
But please don't stop, Ernest.

1177
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:12,820
I enjoy writing things down from dictation.

1178
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:15,940
I have got to 'perfect in every way'.

1179
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,860
You can go on.

1180
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,090
I am quite ready to write down more.

1181
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:22,140
Algernon: (Rather surprised, coughing) Ahem!

1182
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,140
Ahem!

1183
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:24,600
Cecily: Oh, don't cough, Ernest.

1184
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,090
When one is dictating, one should speak clearly
and not cough.

1185
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:29,350
Besides, I can't spell a cough.

1186
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:30,830
(Writing as Algernon speaks)

1187
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:34,490
Algernon: (Speaking very quickly) Cecily,
ever since I first looked at your wonderful

1188
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,270
beauty, I have loved you wildly, passionately,
devotedly, hopelessly.

1189
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:42,330
Cecily: I don't think that you should tell
me you love me wildly, passionately, devotedly,

1190
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,330
hopelessly.

1191
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:46,360
Hopelessly doesn't make much sense, does it?

1192
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,360
Algernon: Cecily.

1193
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,370
(Merriman enters)

1194
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:51,740
Merriman: The carriage is waiting at the door,
sir.

1195
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,510
Algernon: Tell it to come to the door next
week at the same time.

1196
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:57,300
Merriman: (Looking at Cecily, who doesn't
say anything) Yes, sir.

1197
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,300
(Merriman goes off)

1198
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:02,810
Cecily: Uncle Jack would be very annoyed if
he knew you were staying till next week at

1199
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:03,810
the same time.

1200
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:05,950
Algernon: Oh, I don't care about Jack.

1201
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:10,130
I don't care about anybody in the whole world
except you.

1202
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:12,780
I love you, Cecily.

1203
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,450
You will marry me, won't you?

1204
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,580
Cecily: You silly boy!

1205
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:16,580
Of course.

1206
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:22,010
We have been engaged for the last three months.

1207
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,950
Algernon: For the last three months?

1208
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:26,810
Cecily: Yes, it will have been three months
on Thursday.

1209
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:29,200
Algernon: But how did we become engaged?

1210
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:35,620
Cecily: Well, ever since Uncle Jack told us
he had a very wicked younger brother, you,

1211
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:42,430
of course, have been the main topic of conversation
between myself and Miss Prism.

1212
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:45,610
And a man who is talked about all the time
is very attractive.

1213
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:51,870
And I fell in love with you, which is probably
a bit silly of me.

1214
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:53,770
Algernon: Darling!

1215
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,840
And when did we become engaged?

1216
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,800
Cecily: On the fourteenth of February.

1217
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:04,570
I was unhappy that you didn't know I existed,
so I made up my mind to decide the matter,

1218
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:05,870
one way or the other.

1219
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:12,720
After thinking about it for a long time, I
decided to accept your proposal of marriage.

1220
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,760
I decided that we were engaged.

1221
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:21,510
And so the next day I bought this little ring
for you to give me and I promised you that

1222
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,630
I would always wear it.

1223
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:25,990
Algernon: Did I give you this?

1224
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:28,560
It's very pretty, isn't it?

1225
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:32,400
Cecily: Yes, you've got wonderfully good taste,
Ernest.

1226
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,310
It's the excuse I've given you for leading
such a bad life.

1227
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:39,820
And this is the box in which I keep all your
dear letters.

1228
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:40,820
(Putting a box on the table.

1229
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,920
Opening the box and bringing out a bundle
of letters tied up with a blue ribbon)

1230
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,310
Algernon: (Sitting beside her) My letters!

1231
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:48,010
But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written
you any letters.

1232
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:50,560
Cecily: You needn't remind me, Ernest.

1233
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,380
I remember very well that I had to write your
letters for you.

1234
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:58,210
I always wrote three times a week and sometimes
more often.

1235
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:01,220
Algernon: Oh, do let me read them, Cecily.

1236
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:04,390
Cecily: Oh, I couldn't possibly let you do
that.

1237
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:07,000
They would make you far too conceited.

1238
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,080
(Replacing the box) The three that you wrote
me after I had broken off the engagement are

1239
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:20,060
so beautiful and so badly spelt that even
now they make me cry a little when I read

1240
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,060
them.

1241
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,920
Algernon: But was our engagement ever broken
off?

1242
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,060
Cecily: Of course it was.

1243
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,080
On the twenty-second of March.

1244
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,030
You can see the diary entry if you like.

1245
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:34,310
(Showing her diary) 'Today I broke off my
engagement with Ernest.

1246
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:36,350
I feel it is better to do so.

1247
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:38,690
The weather continues to be very pleasant.'

1248
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:41,640
Algernon: But why on earth did you break it
off?

1249
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,420
What had I done?

1250
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:45,750
I had done nothing at all.

1251
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:50,610
Cecily, I am very hurt indeed to hear that
you broke it off.

1252
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:52,230
Particularly when the weather was so pleasant.

1253
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:57,270
Cecily: It wouldn't have been a very serious
engagement if it hadn't been broken off at

1254
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,430
least once.

1255
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:01,350
But I forgave you before the end of the week.

1256
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:05,680
Algernon: What a perfect angel you are, Cecily.

1257
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,130
Cecily: You dear romantic boy.

1258
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:11,200
(He kisses her)

1259
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,300
Algernon: Do you promise that you'll never
break off our engagement again, Cecily?

1260
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:22,040
Cecily: I don't think I could break it off
now that I have actually met you.

1261
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:26,560
Besides, of course, there is your name.

1262
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,910
Algernon: (Sounding nervous) Yes, of course.

1263
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:35,340
Cecily: You must not laugh at me, darling,
but it had always been a dream of mine to

1264
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,540
love someone called Ernest.

1265
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:42,430
(Algernon stands up and then Cecily does also)
There is something about that name which inspires

1266
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:44,020
confidence.

1267
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:48,870
I pity any poor married woman whose husband
is not called Ernest.

1268
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:54,510
Algernon: But, my dear child, couldn't you
love me if I had another name?

1269
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:55,790
Cecily: But what name?

1270
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:59,910
Algernon: Oh, any name you like - Algernon
- for instance...

1271
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:03,390
Cecily: But I don't like the name Algernon.

1272
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:09,130
Algernon: Well, my own dear, sweet, loving
little darling, I can't see why you don't

1273
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:11,190
like the name Algernon.

1274
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:12,990
It is not a bad name.

1275
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:17,270
In fact, it is rather an aristocratic name.

1276
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:20,040
Half the fellows who get into the Bankruptcy
Court are called Algernon.

1277
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,040
But seriously, Cecily...

1278
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:28,620
(Moving to her and making her sit down with
him) if my name was Algy, couldn't you love

1279
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:29,620
me?

1280
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:33,230
Cecily: (Standing up) I might respect you,
Ernest.

1281
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:38,870
I might admire your character, but I would
not really want to spend very much time with

1282
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:39,870
you.

1283
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:40,870
Algernon: Ahem!

1284
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:41,870
Cecily!

1285
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:47,830
(Picking up his hat) The clergyman here is,
I suppose, a very experienced man?

1286
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,020
Cecily: Oh, yes.

1287
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,400
Canon Chasuble is a very learned man.

1288
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,400
He has never written a single book, so you
can imagine how much he knows.

1289
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:59,510
Algernon: I must see him at once about an
important baptism...

1290
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:01,760
I mean... on important business.

1291
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,760
Cecily: Oh!

1292
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,340
Algernon: I shan't be away for more than half
an hour.

1293
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:11,030
Cecily: We have been engaged since the fourteenth
of February and I only met you today for the

1294
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:16,230
first time, so I think it is rather hard that
you should leave me for as long as half an

1295
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:17,230
hour.

1296
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:18,650
Couldn't you make it twenty minutes?

1297
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:20,460
Algernon: I'll be back in no time.

1298
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,760
(He kisses her and runs down the garden)

1299
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,240
Cecily: What an impetuous boy he is!

1300
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,930
I must write about his proposal in my diary.

1301
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:30,620
(She sits down and writes in her diary)

1302
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,620
(Merriman enters)

1303
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:37,750
Merriman: A Miss Fairfax has just called to
see Mr Worthing.

1304
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:40,130
She says it is on very important business.

1305
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:42,420
Cecily: Isn't Mr Worthing in his library?

1306
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:46,060
Merriman: Mr Worthing went to Canon Chasuble's
house some time ago.

1307
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:50,230
Cecily: Please ask the lady to come out into
the garden and join me.

1308
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:52,700
Mr Worthing is sure to be back soon.

1309
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,700
And you can bring tea.

1310
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:54,700
Merriman: Yes, miss.

1311
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,810
(Merriman goes off)

1312
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:58,990
Cecily: (To herself) Miss Fairfax!

1313
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:03,380
I suppose she is one of the many good women
who help Uncle Jack with his charitable work

1314
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,210
in London.

1315
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:09,540
I don't really like women who are interested
in charitable work.

1316
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,540
I think it is so presumptuous of them.

1317
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:12,540
(Merriman enters)

1318
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,540
Merriman: Miss Fairfax.

1319
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:14,540
(Gwendolen enters.

1320
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:15,540
Merriman goes off)

1321
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:17,600
Cecily: (Standing up and going to meet her)
Let me introduce myself to you.

1322
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,409
My name is Cecily Cardew.

1323
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:20,409
Gwendolen: Cecily Cardew?

1324
01:08:20,409 --> 01:08:23,489
(Moving to her and shaking hands) What a very
sweet name!

1325
01:08:23,489 --> 01:08:26,359
I think we are going to be great friends.

1326
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:29,219
I like you already more than I can say.

1327
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:31,870
My first impressions of people are never wrong.

1328
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:37,710
Cecily: How nice of you to like me so much
when we have known each other for such a short

1329
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:38,710
time.

1330
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:39,710
Please sit down.

1331
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:42,190
Gwendolen: (Still standing up) I may call
you Cecily, may I not?

1332
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,029
Cecily: Of course, with pleasure.

1333
01:08:44,029 --> 01:08:47,679
Gwendolen: And you will always call me Gwendolen,
won't you?

1334
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:49,029
Cecily: If you wish.

1335
01:08:49,029 --> 01:08:51,819
Gwendolen: Then that is all quite settled,
is it not?

1336
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:53,109
Cecily: I hope so.

1337
01:08:53,109 --> 01:08:54,109
(A pause.

1338
01:08:54,109 --> 01:08:55,690
Then they both sit down together)

1339
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:59,069
Gwendolen: Perhaps this is a good opportunity
to tell you who I am.

1340
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:02,009
My father is Lord Bracknell.

1341
01:09:02,009 --> 01:09:04,549
You have never heard of Papa, I suppose?

1342
01:09:04,549 --> 01:09:05,949
Cecily: I don't think so.

1343
01:09:05,949 --> 01:09:12,299
Gwendolen: Outside the family circle, Papa,
I am glad to say, is completely unknown.

1344
01:09:12,299 --> 01:09:14,150
I think that is quite right.

1345
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:18,449
The home seems to me to be the proper place
for a man.

1346
01:09:18,449 --> 01:09:24,310
Certainly once a man begins to neglect his
duties at home, it makes him very attractive.

1347
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:32,210
Cecily, Mama, whose views on education are
very strict, has brought me up to be extremely

1348
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:35,109
short-sighted; it is part of her system.

1349
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:38,829
So do you mind me looking at you through my
glasses?

1350
01:09:38,829 --> 01:09:40,140
Cecily: Oh!

1351
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,759
Not at all, Gwendolen.

1352
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,759
I like being looked at.

1353
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:47,960
Gwendolen: (After looking at Cecily carefully
through a lorgnette) You are here on a short

1354
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,199
visit, I suppose?

1355
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:50,440
Cecily: Oh no!

1356
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,710
I live here.

1357
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:53,620
Gwendolen: (Severely) Really?

1358
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:58,020
Your mother, or an elderly female relation,
lives here also?

1359
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,020
Cecily: Oh no!

1360
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:03,070
I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.

1361
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:04,099
Gwendolen: Indeed?

1362
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:09,559
Cecily: My dear guardian, with the help of
Miss Prism, has the difficult task of looking

1363
01:10:09,559 --> 01:10:10,559
after me.

1364
01:10:10,559 --> 01:10:12,119
Gwendolen: Your guardian?

1365
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:15,820
Cecily: Yes, I am Mr Worthing's ward.

1366
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,480
Gwendolen: Oh!

1367
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,940
It is strange that he never mentioned to me
that he had a ward.

1368
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,020
How secretive of him!

1369
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,249
He is becoming more interesting every hour.

1370
01:10:27,249 --> 01:10:31,090
However, I am not sure that I am delighted
by this news.

1371
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:35,599
(Standing up and going to Cecily) I have liked
you ever since I met you, Cecily.

1372
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:42,831
But, now that I know you are Mr Worthing's
ward, I must say that I wish you were - well

1373
01:10:42,831 --> 01:10:48,710
- a bit older than you seem to be - and not
quite so pretty.

1374
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:51,550
In fact, if I may speak candidly...

1375
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:52,550
Cecily: Please do!

1376
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:58,080
I think that when one has anything unpleasant
to say, one should always be quite candid.

1377
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:03,830
Gwendolen: Well, to be quite candid, Cecily,
I wish that you were at least forty-two years

1378
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:06,329
old and extremely plain.

1379
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:09,190
Ernest has an honourable, truthful nature.

1380
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:11,099
He would never be deceitful.

1381
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:16,570
But the most honourable men can be influenced
by the beauty of others.

1382
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:22,099
Modern history, and indeed ancient history,
give us many painful examples of what I refer

1383
01:11:22,099 --> 01:11:23,099
to.

1384
01:11:23,099 --> 01:11:26,030
Indeed, history would be quite unreadable
if it were not so.

1385
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:30,920
Cecily: I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did
you say 'Ernest'?

1386
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,010
Gwendolen: Yes.

1387
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:37,829
Cecily: Oh, but it is not Mr Ernest Worthing
who is my guardian.

1388
01:11:37,829 --> 01:11:39,849
It is his brother - his elder brother.

1389
01:11:39,849 --> 01:11:44,010
Gwendolen: (Sitting down again) Ernest never
mentioned to me that he had a brother.

1390
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:49,440
Cecily: I am sorry to say that they have not
got on well with each other for a long time.

1391
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,699
Gwendolen: Ah!

1392
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:52,829
I see.

1393
01:11:52,829 --> 01:11:58,460
And now I think about it, I have never heard
any man mention his brother.

1394
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:01,389
Most men don't seem to like the subject.

1395
01:12:01,389 --> 01:12:04,619
Cecily, you have lifted a weight from my mind.

1396
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:07,630
I was becoming almost anxious.

1397
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:11,850
It would have been awful if any cloud had
come across such a special friendship, would

1398
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:12,909
it not?

1399
01:12:12,909 --> 01:12:19,840
Are you quite, quite sure that it is not Mr
Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?

1400
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,110
Cecily: Quite sure.

1401
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:26,269
(A pause) In fact, I am going to be his guardian.

1402
01:12:26,269 --> 01:12:28,060
Gwendolen: I beg your pardon?

1403
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:33,489
Cecily: (Shyly) Dearest Gwendolen, there is
no reason why I should keep it a secret from

1404
01:12:33,489 --> 01:12:34,489
you.

1405
01:12:34,489 --> 01:12:37,280
It will be in the local newspaper next week.

1406
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:41,440
Mr Ernest Worthing and I are engaged to be
married.

1407
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:46,160
Gwendolen: (Politely, standing up) My darling
Cecily, I think that there must be some small

1408
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,510
mistake.

1409
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,940
Mr Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.

1410
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:54,070
The announcement will appear in the newspapers
on Saturday at the latest.

1411
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:58,469
Cecily: (Very politely, standing up) I am
afraid that you are mistaken.

1412
01:12:58,469 --> 01:13:01,440
Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes
ago.

1413
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,550
(Showing her diary to Gwendolen)

1414
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:05,659
Gwendolen: (Looking at the diary very carefully
through her lorgnette) It is very strange

1415
01:13:05,659 --> 01:13:10,239
because he asked me to be his wife yesterday
afternoon at half-past five.

1416
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:11,650
Please check for yourself.

1417
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:16,119
(Producing a diary of her own) I never travel
without my diary.

1418
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:20,179
One should always have something exciting
to read on the train.

1419
01:13:20,179 --> 01:13:28,760
I am so sorry, dear Cecily, if it is any disappointment
to you, but I am afraid that I was his first

1420
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,760
choice.

1421
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:36,909
Cecily: It would make me very sad, dear Gwendolen,
to cause you any pain, but I feel I must point

1422
01:13:36,909 --> 01:13:41,920
out that since Ernest proposed to you he has
clearly changed his mind.

1423
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,409
Gwendolen: (Thoughtfully) If the poor fellow
has been trapped into making a foolish promise,

1424
01:13:46,409 --> 01:13:50,230
it is my duty to rescue him at once - and
firmly.

1425
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:55,429
Cecily: (Thoughtfully and sadly) If my dear
boy has got into an unfortunate entanglement,

1426
01:13:55,429 --> 01:13:58,540
I will never reproach him for it when we are
married.

1427
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:02,469
Gwendolen: Are you calling me an entanglement,
Miss Cardew?

1428
01:14:02,469 --> 01:14:05,510
You are presumptuous.

1429
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:11,050
On an occasion of this kind, it becomes more
than a duty to speak one's mind.

1430
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,780
It becomes a pleasure.

1431
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:19,860
Cecily: Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that
I trapped Ernest into an engagement?

1432
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,599
How dare you!

1433
01:14:22,599 --> 01:14:25,690
This is no time to pretend to have good manners.

1434
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:29,249
When I see a spade, I call it a spade.

1435
01:14:29,249 --> 01:14:32,900
Gwendolen: I am glad to say that I have never
seen a spade.

1436
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:36,050
It is obvious we do not live in the same social
circle.

1437
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:37,050
(Merriman enters, pushing a small trolley.

1438
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,050
It holds a tablecloth, a teapot, some milk,
sugar, plates of cakes, muffins, teacake,

1439
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:39,050
bread and butter, and some plates.

1440
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:40,050
Cecily is about to reply but doesn't while
the servant is there)

1441
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:42,869
Merriman: Shall I set the table for afternoon
tea here as usual, miss?

1442
01:14:42,869 --> 01:14:44,801
Cecily: (Sternly, in a calm voice) Yes, as
usual.

1443
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:45,801
(Merriman begins to lay the cloth on the table.

1444
01:14:45,801 --> 01:14:46,801
There is a long pause.

1445
01:14:46,801 --> 01:14:48,040
Cecily and Gwendolen look angrily at each
other)

1446
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,559
Gwendolen: Are there many interesting walks
near here, Miss Cardew?

1447
01:14:52,559 --> 01:14:55,800
Cecily: Oh, yes, a great many.

1448
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,139
From the top of one of the hills one can see
five counties.

1449
01:14:59,139 --> 01:15:01,510
Gwendolen: Five counties!

1450
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:04,460
I don't think I should like that; I hate crowds.

1451
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:07,639
Cecily: (Sweetly) I suppose that is why you
live in town.

1452
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:11,159
(Gwendolen doesn't answer and taps her foot
nervously on the ground)

1453
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:15,940
Gwendolen: (Looking around) This is quite
a well-kept garden, Miss Cardew.

1454
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:18,270
Cecily: I'm glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.

1455
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:21,920
Gwendolen: I had no idea there were any flowers
in the country.

1456
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:27,599
Cecily: Oh, flowers are as common here, Miss
Fairfax, as people are in London.

1457
01:15:27,599 --> 01:15:33,809
Gwendolen: Personally, I cannot imagine how
anyone manages to live in the country - if

1458
01:15:33,809 --> 01:15:36,429
anybody who is anybody does.

1459
01:15:36,429 --> 01:15:40,079
The country always bores me to death.

1460
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:42,960
Cecily: Would you like some tea, Miss Fairfax?

1461
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,960
Gwendolen: (Extremely politely) Yes, thank
you.

1462
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,969
(To herself) Hateful girl!

1463
01:15:47,969 --> 01:15:49,190
But I want some tea!

1464
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:50,869
Cecily: (Sweetly) Sugar?

1465
01:15:50,869 --> 01:15:53,119
Gwendolen: No, thank you.

1466
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:55,170
Sugar is not fashionable anymore.

1467
01:15:55,170 --> 01:16:00,560
(Cecily looks angrily at her, picks up the
sugar tongs and puts four lumps of sugar into

1468
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,560
the cup)

1469
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,560
Cecily: (Severely) Cake or bread and butter?

1470
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,560
Gwendolen: (In a bored way) Bread and butter,
please.

1471
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,000
Cake is not seen in the best houses nowadays.

1472
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Cecily: (Cutting a very large slice of cake
and putting it on the tray which Merriman

1473
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,590
is holding) Give that to Miss Fairfax.

1474
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:12,590
(Merriman gives Gwendolen the cake and goes
off.

1475
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:13,590
Gwendolen drinks some tea and makes a face.

1476
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:14,590
She puts down her cup, reaches out her hand
for the bread and butter, looks at it and

1477
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:15,590
finds that it is cake.

1478
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:16,590
She stands up angrily)

1479
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:18,070
Gwendolen: You have filled my tea with lumps
of sugar.

1480
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:23,519
And, though I asked for bread and butter,
you have given me cake.

1481
01:16:23,519 --> 01:16:29,909
I am known to be sweet-tempered, but I warn
you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.

1482
01:16:29,909 --> 01:16:35,340
Cecily: (Standing up) I would go any distance
to save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from

1483
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,429
being trapped by a girl like you.

1484
01:16:37,429 --> 01:16:41,050
Gwendolen: I have distrusted you from the
moment I saw you.

1485
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:43,400
I felt you were false and deceitful.

1486
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,070
I am never wrong in such matters.

1487
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:48,449
My first impressions of people are always
right.

1488
01:16:48,449 --> 01:16:51,809
Cecily: It seems to me that I am keeping you
from other appointments.

1489
01:16:51,809 --> 01:16:56,510
No doubt you have many other similar calls
to make in the area.

1490
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:58,099
(Jack enters)

1491
01:16:58,099 --> 01:17:01,270
Gwendolen: (Seeing him) Ernest!

1492
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:03,650
My own Ernest!

1493
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:05,239
Jack: Gwendolen!

1494
01:17:05,239 --> 01:17:06,239
Darling!

1495
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:07,239
(Offering to kiss her)

1496
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:08,239
Gwendolen: (Drawing away from Jack) Wait a
moment!

1497
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:12,500
May I ask if you are engaged to be married
to this young lady?

1498
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,500
(Pointing to Cecily)

1499
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,059
Jack: (Laughing) To dear little Cecily?

1500
01:17:15,059 --> 01:17:16,290
Of course not!

1501
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:19,980
What could have put such an idea into your
pretty little head?

1502
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:21,030
Gwendolen: Thank you.

1503
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:22,389
You may kiss me.

1504
01:17:22,389 --> 01:17:23,389
(Offering her cheek)

1505
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:27,829
Cecily: (Very sweetly) I knew there must be
some kind of misunderstanding, Miss Fairfax.

1506
01:17:27,829 --> 01:17:36,059
The gentleman whose arm is at present around
your waist is my guardian, Mr Jack Worthing.

1507
01:17:36,059 --> 01:17:37,880
Gwendolen: I beg your pardon?

1508
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,980
Cecily: This is Uncle Jack,

1509
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:42,489
Gwendolen: (Pulling away from Jack) Jack!

1510
01:17:42,489 --> 01:17:43,489
Oh!

1511
01:17:43,489 --> 01:17:44,489
(Algernon enters)

1512
01:17:44,489 --> 01:17:45,489
Cecily: Here is Ernest.

1513
01:17:45,489 --> 01:17:47,880
Algernon: (Going straight to Cecily without
noticing anyone else) My own love!

1514
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:48,880
(Offering to kiss her)

1515
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,849
Cecily: (Drawing away from Algernon) Wait
a moment, Ernest!

1516
01:17:52,849 --> 01:17:58,090
May I ask you - are you engaged to be married
to this young lady?

1517
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,170
Algernon: (Looking around) To what young lady?

1518
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:01,579
Good heavens!

1519
01:18:01,579 --> 01:18:02,719
Gwendolen!

1520
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:03,830
Of course not!

1521
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:06,969
What could have put such an idea into your
pretty little head?

1522
01:18:06,969 --> 01:18:08,150
Cecily: Thank you.

1523
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,900
(Offering her cheek) You may kiss me.

1524
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,090
(Algernon kisses her)

1525
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:16,090
Gwendolen: I felt there was some slight error,
Miss Cardew.

1526
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:23,260
The gentleman whose arm is at present around
your waist is my cousin, Mr Algernon Moncrieff.

1527
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:30,179
Cecily: (Breaking away from Algernon) Algernon
Moncrieff!

1528
01:18:30,179 --> 01:18:31,179
Oh!

1529
01:18:31,179 --> 01:18:32,179
(The two girls move towards each other and
put their arms around each other's waists

1530
01:18:32,179 --> 01:18:33,179
as if for protection)

1531
01:18:33,179 --> 01:18:34,179
Are you called Algernon?

1532
01:18:34,179 --> 01:18:35,179
Algernon: I cannot deny it.

1533
01:18:35,179 --> 01:18:36,179
Cecily: Oh!

1534
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:37,179
Gwendolen: Is your name really Jack?

1535
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:38,179
Jack: (Standing rather proudly) I could deny
it if I liked.

1536
01:18:38,179 --> 01:18:39,350
I could deny anything if I liked.

1537
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:42,110
But my name certainly is Jack.

1538
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:43,460
It has been Jack for years.

1539
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:46,650
Cecily: We have both been terribly deceived.

1540
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:48,920
Gwendolen: My poor wounded Cecily!

1541
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,199
Cecily: My poor wronged Gwendolen!

1542
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:54,090
Gwendolen: (Slowly and seriously) Please will
you call me 'sister'.

1543
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:55,090
(They embrace.

1544
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:56,090
Jack and Algernon groan and walk up and down)

1545
01:18:56,090 --> 01:19:03,840
Cecily: (Rather brightly) There is just one
question I would like to ask my guardian.

1546
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,469
Gwendolen: A very good idea!

1547
01:19:06,469 --> 01:19:11,499
Mr Worthing, there is just one question I
would like permission to ask you.

1548
01:19:11,499 --> 01:19:14,349
Where is your brother Ernest?

1549
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:18,909
We are both engaged to be married to your
brother Ernest so it is important for us to

1550
01:19:18,909 --> 01:19:20,860
know where he is at present.

1551
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:29,190
Jack: (Slowly and hesitantly) Gwendolen - Cecily
- it is very painful for me but I must speak

1552
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:30,820
the truth.

1553
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:36,159
It is the first time in my life that I have
been in such a painful position and I am quite

1554
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:38,380
inexperienced at doing this.

1555
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:44,330
However, I will tell you honestly that I have
no brother Ernest.

1556
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:46,079
I have no brother at all.

1557
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:50,110
I have never had a brother in my life and
I don't intend ever to have a brother in the

1558
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:51,110
future.

1559
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:52,199
Cecily: (Surprised) No brother at all?

1560
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:53,199
Jack: (Cheerfully) None!

1561
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:56,090
Gwendolen: (Severely) Did you ever have a
brother of any kind?

1562
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:57,199
Jack: (Pleasantly) Never.

1563
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,070
Not of any kind.

1564
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:02,650
Gwendolen: I am afraid, Cecily, that neither
of us is engaged to be married to anyone.

1565
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:08,760
Cecily: It is not a very pleasant position
for a young girl suddenly to find herself

1566
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,760
in, is it?

1567
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,810
Gwendolen: Let us go into the house.

1568
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:14,710
They will not follow us into the house, will
they?

1569
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:17,780
Cecily: No, men are so cowardly, aren't they?

1570
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:21,989
(They go into the house, after looking scornfully
at the men)

1571
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:27,040
Jack: I suppose that this awful business is
what you call Bunburying, is it?

1572
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:32,329
Algernon: (Laughing) Yes, and it's the best
Bunburying I have ever done in my life.

1573
01:20:32,329 --> 01:20:35,610
Jack: Well, you have no right to Bunbury here.

1574
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:37,750
Algernon: That is absurd.

1575
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:41,249
One has a right to Bunbury wherever one chooses.

1576
01:20:41,249 --> 01:20:43,469
Every serious Bunburyist knows that.

1577
01:20:43,469 --> 01:20:45,099
Jack: What are you saying?

1578
01:20:45,099 --> 01:20:46,519
Serious Bunburyist?

1579
01:20:46,519 --> 01:20:47,590
Good heavens!

1580
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:53,400
Algernon: Well, one must be serious about
something if one wants to enjoy one's life.

1581
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,079
I am serious about Bunburying.

1582
01:20:56,079 --> 01:21:01,690
I have no idea what you are serious about
- I suppose you are serious about everything.

1583
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:07,560
Jack: Well, the only satisfaction I get from
this awful business is that you won't be able

1584
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,869
to Bunbury anymore.

1585
01:21:09,869 --> 01:21:13,730
Your friend, Bunbury, is quite finished.

1586
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:18,180
You won't be able to run away from town to
the country quite so often now, Algy.

1587
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:21,249
And that's a very good thing.

1588
01:21:21,249 --> 01:21:26,170
Algernon: Your brother isn't very well, is
he, Jack?

1589
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:28,119
Dead, in fact.

1590
01:21:28,119 --> 01:21:32,809
You won't be able to run away to town from
the country quite so often now.

1591
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:34,699
And that's a very good thing too.

1592
01:21:34,699 --> 01:21:39,929
Jack: And you have behaved very badly towards
Miss Cardew.

1593
01:21:39,929 --> 01:21:48,030
I must say that deceiving a sweet, simple
girl like Cecily is very wicked of you.

1594
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:50,479
To say nothing of the fact that she is my
ward.

1595
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:56,500
Algernon: I must say that deceiving a brilliant,
clever young lady like Miss Fairfax is very

1596
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,940
wicked of you.

1597
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:00,880
To say nothing of the fact that she is my
cousin.

1598
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,280
Jack: I wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen,
that is all.

1599
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,280
I love her.

1600
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,729
Algernon: Well, I simply wanted to be engaged
to Cecily.

1601
01:22:08,729 --> 01:22:10,139
I adore her.

1602
01:22:10,139 --> 01:22:14,179
Jack: There is certainly no chance of you
marrying Miss Cardew.

1603
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:18,389
Algernon: I don't think there is much chance
of you marrying Miss Fairfax, Jack.

1604
01:22:18,389 --> 01:22:21,309
(Sitting at the table and beginning to eat
muffins)

1605
01:22:21,309 --> 01:22:25,239
Jack: I can't understand how you can sit there
calmly eating muffins when we are in this

1606
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:26,770
awful trouble.

1607
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:29,150
You seem to me to be perfectly heartless.

1608
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:34,610
Algernon: Well, I can't eat muffins in an
agitated manner.

1609
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:37,030
The butter would probably get on my cuffs.

1610
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:40,499
One should always eat muffins calmly.

1611
01:22:40,499 --> 01:22:42,090
It is the only way to eat them.

1612
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:47,489
Jack: I think that it is perfectly heartless
to be eating muffins at all in the circumstances.

1613
01:22:47,489 --> 01:22:52,110
Algernon: When I am in trouble, eating is
the only thing which makes me feel better.

1614
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:59,249
Indeed, when I am in very great trouble, I
refuse everything except food and drink.

1615
01:22:59,249 --> 01:23:03,260
At present, I am eating muffins because I
am unhappy.

1616
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:05,070
Besides, I like muffins.

1617
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:06,070
(Standing up)

1618
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,440
Jack: (Standing up) Well, that is no reason
why you should eat them all.

1619
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,760
(Taking the plate of muffins from Algernon)

1620
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:13,969
Algernon: (Offering Jack teacake) Please will
you have teacake instead.

1621
01:23:13,969 --> 01:23:15,420
I don't like teacake.

1622
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:17,620
Jack: Good heavens!

1623
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:21,849
I think a man may eat his own muffins in his
own garden.

1624
01:23:21,849 --> 01:23:25,469
Algernon: But you just said that it was perfectly
heartless to eat muffins.

1625
01:23:25,469 --> 01:23:30,219
Jack: I said it was perfectly heartless of
you to eat muffins.

1626
01:23:30,219 --> 01:23:32,110
That is very different.

1627
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,270
Algernon: Maybe.

1628
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:35,420
But the muffins are the same.

1629
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:36,420
(Taking the plate of muffins from Jack)

1630
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:37,489
Jack: Algy, I wish you would go.

1631
01:23:37,489 --> 01:23:41,389
Algernon: You can't ask me to go without giving
me some dinner.

1632
01:23:41,389 --> 01:23:44,139
I never go without my dinner.

1633
01:23:44,139 --> 01:23:49,170
Besides I have just arranged with Canon Chasuble
to be baptized at a quarter to six.

1634
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:52,320
I am going to be baptized with the name of
Ernest.

1635
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,560
Jack: My dear fellow, no you aren't.

1636
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,809
That is nonsense.

1637
01:23:56,809 --> 01:24:01,849
I arranged with Canon Chasuble to be baptized
myself at half-past five.

1638
01:24:01,849 --> 01:24:06,250
I will, of course, take the name Ernest.

1639
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,650
Gwendolen would want me to.

1640
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:11,170
We cannot both be baptized with the name Ernest.

1641
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:12,420
It's absurd.

1642
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:15,719
Besides, I have a right to be baptized if
I like.

1643
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:18,760
There is no evidence that I have ever been
baptized.

1644
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:23,449
I think it very likely that I never was and
so does Canon Chasuble.

1645
01:24:23,449 --> 01:24:25,349
It is different for you.

1646
01:24:25,349 --> 01:24:27,389
You have been baptized already.

1647
01:24:27,389 --> 01:24:30,150
Algernon: Yes, but that was years ago.

1648
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:33,370
Jack: Yes, but you have been baptized.

1649
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:35,380
That is the important thing.

1650
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:36,570
Algernon: Yes indeed.

1651
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:39,850
So I know my health can bear it.

1652
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:45,560
I must say I think that it is rather dangerous
for you to be baptized now.

1653
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:48,699
It might make you very unwell.

1654
01:24:48,699 --> 01:24:54,590
You can't have forgotten that a close relative
very nearly died in Paris this week of a bad

1655
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:55,590
cold.

1656
01:24:55,590 --> 01:25:00,590
Jack: Yes, but you said yourself that a bad
cold was not hereditary.

1657
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:05,489
Algernon: I know it didn't use to be - but
it probably is now.

1658
01:25:05,489 --> 01:25:08,300
Science is always making wonderful improvements.

1659
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:11,070
Jack: (Picking up the muffin plate) Oh that
is nonsense.

1660
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:12,800
You always talk nonsense.

1661
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,110
Algernon: Jack - muffins again!

1662
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,960
I wish you wouldn't.

1663
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,249
There are only two left.

1664
01:25:18,249 --> 01:25:22,409
(Taking them) I told you I was particularly
fond of muffins.

1665
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,000
Jack: But I hate teacake.

1666
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,619
Algernon: Then why on earth do you serve teacake
to your guests?

1667
01:25:28,619 --> 01:25:30,940
I don't like your ideas of hospitality.

1668
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:32,420
Jack: Algernon!

1669
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,540
I have already told you to go.

1670
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:37,229
I don't want you here.

1671
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:38,860
Why don't you go?

1672
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:42,469
Algernon: Because I haven't finished my tea
yet!

1673
01:25:42,469 --> 01:25:45,420
I have one muffin left.

1674
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:51,570
(Jack groans and sits down.

1675
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:55,269
Algernon continues eating)

1676
01:25:55,269 --> 01:25:56,269
ACT THREE

1677
01:25:56,269 --> 01:25:57,269
(The living room at the Manor House.

1678
01:25:57,269 --> 01:25:59,769
Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window looking
out into the garden)

1679
01:25:59,769 --> 01:26:04,019
Gwendolen: They have not followed us into
the house, as anyone else would have done.

1680
01:26:04,019 --> 01:26:05,519
They must be ashamed.

1681
01:26:05,519 --> 01:26:07,979
Cecily: They have been eating muffins.

1682
01:26:07,979 --> 01:26:10,119
That looks like repentance to me.

1683
01:26:10,119 --> 01:26:12,380
Gwendolen: (After a pause while she thinks
about what Cecily has said) They don't seem

1684
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:13,739
to notice us at all.

1685
01:26:13,739 --> 01:26:14,739
Couldn't you cough?

1686
01:26:14,739 --> 01:26:16,739
Cecily: But I haven't got a cough.

1687
01:26:16,739 --> 01:26:19,010
Gwendolen: They're looking at us.

1688
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:20,010
How dare they!

1689
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:21,499
Cecily: They're coming towards us.

1690
01:26:21,499 --> 01:26:22,760
How presumptuous of them.

1691
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:25,550
Gwendolen: Let us remain silent and dignified.

1692
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:27,239
Cecily: Certainly.

1693
01:26:27,239 --> 01:26:28,880
It is the only thing to do now.

1694
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,050
(Jack enters, followed by Algernon.

1695
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:34,510
They are whistling the tune of a popular song)

1696
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:37,469
Gwendolen: This dignified silence is rather
unpleasant.

1697
01:26:37,469 --> 01:26:39,530
Cecily: Yes, I agree.

1698
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:40,530
It is.

1699
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:42,460
Gwendolen: But we will not be the first to
speak.

1700
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:43,510
Cecily: Certainly not.

1701
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:46,909
Gwendolen: Mr Worthing, I have something to
ask you.

1702
01:26:46,909 --> 01:26:48,909
Your reply is extremely important.

1703
01:26:48,909 --> 01:26:51,829
Cecily: Gwendolen, I value your common sense.

1704
01:26:51,829 --> 01:26:56,600
Mr Moncrieff, I would be grateful if you would
answer the following question.

1705
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,960
Why did you pretend to be my guardian's brother?

1706
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:03,860
Algernon: In order that I might have the opportunity
of meeting you.

1707
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:08,980
Cecily: (To Gwendolen) That seems a satisfactory
explanation, does it not?

1708
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:11,449
Gwendolen: Yes, dear, if you can believe him.

1709
01:27:11,449 --> 01:27:13,380
Cecily: I don't believe him.

1710
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:15,800
But it is a wonderful answer.

1711
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,650
Gwendolen: That is true.

1712
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:23,239
If you are talking about something very serious,
the style of what you say is much more important

1713
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:24,780
than the sincerity.

1714
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:29,739
Mr Worthing, why did you pretend to have a
brother?

1715
01:27:29,739 --> 01:27:33,530
Was it in order that you could come to town
as often as possible to see me?

1716
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:35,780
Jack: Can you doubt that, Miss Fairfax?

1717
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:39,090
Gwendolen: I have very strong doubts.

1718
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:40,739
But I intend to ignore them.

1719
01:27:40,739 --> 01:27:45,760
(Going closer to Cecily) Their explanations
appear to be quite satisfactory, especially

1720
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:46,760
Mr Worthing's.

1721
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,659
His answer seems to me to be particularly
truthful.

1722
01:27:48,659 --> 01:27:53,949
Cecily: I am very happy with what Mr Moncrieff
said.

1723
01:27:53,949 --> 01:27:58,329
The sound of his voice alone makes me feel
certain that I should believe him.

1724
01:27:58,329 --> 01:28:00,639
Gwendolen: Then, do you think we should forgive
them?

1725
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:01,639
Cecily: Yes...

1726
01:28:01,639 --> 01:28:03,849
I mean no.

1727
01:28:03,849 --> 01:28:04,849
Gwendolen: I agree!

1728
01:28:04,849 --> 01:28:07,550
I had forgotten something.

1729
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:10,869
We have ideals which we must not ignore.

1730
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:12,360
Which of us should tell them?

1731
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,159
The task is not a pleasant one.

1732
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:17,329
Cecily: Could we not both speak to them at
the same time?

1733
01:28:17,329 --> 01:28:20,150
Gwendolen: That is an excellent idea!

1734
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:23,150
I nearly always speak at the same time as
other people.

1735
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:24,150
Are you ready?

1736
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,150
Cecily: Certainly.

1737
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:26,710
(Gwendolen beats time with a finger as if
she is conducting an orchestra)

1738
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:30,860
Gwendolen and Cecily: (Speaking together)
Your first names are a problem that cannot

1739
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,469
be solved.

1740
01:28:32,469 --> 01:28:33,469
That is all!

1741
01:28:33,469 --> 01:28:36,309
Jack and Algernon: (Speaking together) Our
first names!

1742
01:28:36,309 --> 01:28:37,960
Is that all?

1743
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:41,900
But we are going to be baptized later this
afternoon.

1744
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:45,289
Gwendolen: (To Jack) Are you really prepared
to do this terrible thing for my sake?

1745
01:28:45,289 --> 01:28:46,289
Jack: I am.

1746
01:28:46,289 --> 01:28:52,080
Cecily: (To Algernon) Are you really prepared
to face this awful ordeal to please me?

1747
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,559
Algernon: I am!

1748
01:28:53,559 --> 01:28:58,440
Gwendolen: How absurd to talk about the equality
of the sexes!

1749
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:01,170
Men are infinitely better than us at self-sacrifice.

1750
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,519
Jack: We are!

1751
01:29:02,519 --> 01:29:03,820
(Getting hold of Algernon's hand)

1752
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:07,239
Cecily: They have moments of courage of which
we women know nothing.

1753
01:29:07,239 --> 01:29:08,500
Gwendolen: (To Jack) Darling!

1754
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,750
Cecily: (To Algernon) Darling!

1755
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:11,639
(They fall into each other's arms.

1756
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:12,639
Merriman enters.

1757
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:13,639
When he sees the situation, he coughs loudly)

1758
01:29:13,639 --> 01:29:14,639
Merriman: Ahem!

1759
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:15,639
Ahem!

1760
01:29:15,639 --> 01:29:16,639
Lady Bracknell is here.

1761
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:17,639
Jack: Good heavens!

1762
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:18,639
(Lady Bracknell enters.

1763
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:19,639
The couples separate very quickly.

1764
01:29:19,639 --> 01:29:20,639
Merriman goes off)

1765
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:21,639
Lady Bracknell: Gwendolen!

1766
01:29:21,639 --> 01:29:22,639
What does this mean?

1767
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:26,800
Gwendolen: It means that I am engaged to be
married to Mr Worthing, Mama.

1768
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,130
Lady Bracknell: Come here.

1769
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,730
Sit down.

1770
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:31,789
Sit down immediately.

1771
01:29:31,789 --> 01:29:38,659
(To Jack) I learnt of Gwendolen's sudden departure
from her trusted maid, who gave me the information

1772
01:29:38,659 --> 01:29:41,830
after I had given her a small coin.

1773
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:44,429
I followed her at once on the next train.

1774
01:29:44,429 --> 01:29:50,119
Her father does not know where she is and
I don't propose to tell him the truth.

1775
01:29:50,119 --> 01:29:52,880
In fact, I never tell him the truth about
anything.

1776
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,199
I would consider it wrong to do so.

1777
01:29:56,199 --> 01:30:03,900
You must understand that all communication
between you and my daughter must stop immediately.

1778
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:08,300
On this point, as indeed on all points, I
am firm.

1779
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:12,660
Jack: I am engaged to be married to Gwendolen,
Lady Bracknell!

1780
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:15,409
Lady Bracknell: You are not, sir.

1781
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:16,409
And now...

1782
01:30:16,409 --> 01:30:17,409
Algernon...!

1783
01:30:17,409 --> 01:30:19,199
Algernon: Yes, Aunt Augusta.

1784
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:25,449
Lady Bracknell: Is this the house in which
your invalid friend Mr Bunbury lives?

1785
01:30:25,449 --> 01:30:28,110
Algernon: (Finding it difficult to speak)
Oh!

1786
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:29,110
No!

1787
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:30,280
Bunbury doesn't live here.

1788
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:32,679
Bunbury is somewhere else at present.

1789
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:35,460
In fact, Bunbury is dead.

1790
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:36,890
Lady Bracknell: Dead!

1791
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:39,450
When did Mr Bunbury die?

1792
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:42,369
His death must have been extremely sudden.

1793
01:30:42,369 --> 01:30:43,369
Algernon: Oh!

1794
01:30:43,369 --> 01:30:45,349
I killed Bunbury this afternoon...

1795
01:30:45,349 --> 01:30:49,210
I mean poor Bunbury died this afternoon.

1796
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:51,510
Lady Bracknell: What did he die of?

1797
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:53,659
Algernon: Bunbury?

1798
01:30:53,659 --> 01:30:56,219
Oh he was quite exploded.

1799
01:30:56,219 --> 01:30:57,979
Lady Bracknell: Exploded?

1800
01:30:57,979 --> 01:31:00,610
Was he the victim of a terrorist plot?

1801
01:31:00,610 --> 01:31:04,340
I was not aware that Mr Bunbury was interested
in politics.

1802
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:07,550
If so, he deserved his punishment.

1803
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:13,040
Algernon: My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean that
he was found out!

1804
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:19,699
What I mean is the doctors found out that
Bunbury could not live - so he died.

1805
01:31:19,699 --> 01:31:25,080
Lady Bracknell: He seems to have had great
confidence in his doctors' opinions.

1806
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:31,060
I am glad, however, that he made up his mind
to do something definite and acted on proper

1807
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:33,530
medical advice.

1808
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:41,659
And now, Mr Worthing, may I ask: who is that
young person whose hand my nephew Algernon

1809
01:31:41,659 --> 01:31:42,869
is holding?

1810
01:31:42,869 --> 01:31:46,489
He is holding it, I may add, in a most unnecessary
way.

1811
01:31:46,489 --> 01:31:50,090
Jack: The lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.

1812
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:51,090
(Lady Bracknell bows coldly to Cecily)

1813
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:53,729
Algernon: I am engaged to be married to Cecily,
Aunt Augusta.

1814
01:31:53,729 --> 01:31:55,520
Lady Bracknell: I beg your pardon?

1815
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,440
Cecily: Mr Moncrieff and I are engaged to
be married, Lady Bracknell.

1816
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:03,210
Lady Bracknell: (Shivering, then moving over
to the sofa and sitting down) I do not know

1817
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:09,340
whether there is anything very exciting about
the air in Hertfordshire, but the number of

1818
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:14,840
engagements being made seems to be considerably
above the expected average.

1819
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:19,510
I think that it would be a good idea for me
to make some preliminary enquiries.

1820
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:27,389
Mr Worthing, is Miss Cardew connected with
any of the larger railway stations in London?

1821
01:32:27,389 --> 01:32:30,840
I am merely asking for information.

1822
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:36,020
I did not know until yesterday that there
were families or persons who were related

1823
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,020
to railway stations.

1824
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:42,949
Jack: (Speaking in a cold, clear voice) Miss
Cardew is the granddaughter of the late Mr

1825
01:32:42,949 --> 01:32:53,079
Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, London;
of Gervase Park, Dorking, Surrey; and also

1826
01:32:53,079 --> 01:32:56,249
of The Sporran, Fifeshire, Scotland.

1827
01:32:56,249 --> 01:33:00,670
Lady Bracknell: That sounds not unsatisfactory.

1828
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:04,039
Three addresses always inspire confidence.

1829
01:33:04,039 --> 01:33:06,329
But I have no proof that they are real.

1830
01:33:06,329 --> 01:33:11,309
Jack: Miss Cardew's family lawyers are Markby,
Markby and Markby.

1831
01:33:11,309 --> 01:33:14,809
Lady Bracknell: Markby, Markby and Markby?

1832
01:33:14,809 --> 01:33:19,429
They are lawyers in the very highest position
of their profession.

1833
01:33:19,429 --> 01:33:26,130
Indeed I know that one of the Mr Markbys is
occasionally to be seen at dinner parties.

1834
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:27,260
I am almost satisfied.

1835
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:32,670
Jack: (Very irritably) How extremely kind
of you, Lady Bracknell!

1836
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:39,340
I have also got, you will be pleased to hear,
certificates of Miss Cardew's birth, baptism

1837
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:46,280
and confirmation of vaccinations for whooping
cough and the measles - both German and English.

1838
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:47,500
Lady Bracknell: Ah!

1839
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,260
A busy life, I see.

1840
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:54,019
Though perhaps it has been too exciting for
a young girl.

1841
01:33:54,019 --> 01:33:57,670
I do not believe a young girl should have
too many experiences.

1842
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:59,460
(Standing up and looking at her watch) Gwendolen!

1843
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:00,590
We must leave.

1844
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:03,429
We have not a moment to lose.

1845
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:10,829
Since I am making enquiries, Mr Worthing,
I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any

1846
01:34:10,829 --> 01:34:11,969
personal fortune.

1847
01:34:11,969 --> 01:34:13,110
Jack: Oh!

1848
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:19,770
She has an investment of a hundred and thirty
thousand pounds in Government Stocks, so her

1849
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:22,809
annual income is very large.

1850
01:34:22,809 --> 01:34:24,050
That is all.

1851
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:26,309
Goodbye, Lady Bracknell.

1852
01:34:26,309 --> 01:34:28,130
So pleased to have seen you.

1853
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:31,510
Lady Bracknell: (Sitting down again) Just
a moment, Mr Worthing.

1854
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:34,019
A hundred and thirty thousand pounds!

1855
01:34:34,019 --> 01:34:37,790
And in Government Stocks!

1856
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:45,559
Miss Cardew seems to me to be a very attractive
young lady, now that I look at her.

1857
01:34:45,559 --> 01:34:51,329
Few girls today have any good qualities which
last and improve with time.

1858
01:34:51,329 --> 01:34:55,650
We live in a time, sadly, when beauty is the
only important thing.

1859
01:34:55,650 --> 01:34:57,079
(To Cecily) Come here, dear.

1860
01:34:57,079 --> 01:34:59,590
(Cecily goes to her) You are a pretty child!

1861
01:34:59,590 --> 01:35:04,880
Your dress is not very fashionable and your
hair has not been styled very well.

1862
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,810
But we can soon alter that.

1863
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:12,630
An experienced French maid will produce a
very good result in a short time.

1864
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:18,769
I remember recommending one to Lady Lancing
and after a few months her own husband did

1865
01:35:18,769 --> 01:35:19,769
not know her.

1866
01:35:19,769 --> 01:35:21,920
Jack: After a few months nobody knew her.

1867
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,479
Lady Bracknell: (Glaring at Jack, then pretending
to smile at Cecily) Turn round, sweet child.

1868
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:27,190
(Cecily turns completely round in a circle)
No, I want to see you from the side.

1869
01:35:27,190 --> 01:35:29,320
(Cecily turns round so that Lady Bracknell
can see her: face in profile from the side)

1870
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:31,599
Yes, very good.

1871
01:35:31,599 --> 01:35:38,229
There is much about your situation which is
promising - you could fit well into good society.

1872
01:35:38,229 --> 01:35:41,300
Hold your chin a little higher, dear.

1873
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,340
Chins are worn very high at present.

1874
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:44,340
Algernon!

1875
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:45,600
Algernon: Yes, Aunt Augusta!

1876
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:50,600
Lady Bracknell: There is much about her situation
which is promising - she could fit well into

1877
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:51,600
good society.

1878
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,719
Algernon: Cecily is the sweetest, dearest,
prettiest girl in the whole world.

1879
01:35:55,719 --> 01:35:58,119
And I don't care about her fitting into good
society.

1880
01:35:58,119 --> 01:36:02,730
Lady Bracknell: Do not be dismissive of good
society, Algernon.

1881
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:06,250
Only people who can't get into good society
speak like that.

1882
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:11,429
(To Cecily) Dear child, of course Algernon
has no money.

1883
01:36:11,429 --> 01:36:14,139
He has nothing but his debts to bring to a
marriage.

1884
01:36:14,139 --> 01:36:17,480
But I do not approve of marrying for money.

1885
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:23,479
When I married Lord Bracknell, I had no fortune
at all, but I didn't allow that to stand in

1886
01:36:23,479 --> 01:36:24,540
my way.

1887
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:29,340
Well, I suppose I must give my consent to
this marriage.

1888
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,760
Algernon: Thank you, Aunt Augusta.

1889
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,489
Lady Bracknell: Cecily, you may kiss me!

1890
01:36:33,489 --> 01:36:36,039
Cecily: (Kissing her) Thank you, Lady Bracknell.

1891
01:36:36,039 --> 01:36:40,500
Lady Bracknell: You may also call me Aunt
Augusta in future.

1892
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,179
Cecily: Thank you, Aunt Augusta.

1893
01:36:42,179 --> 01:36:45,110
Lady Bracknell: The marriage ought to take
place quite soon.

1894
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:46,690
Algernon: Thank you, Aunt Augusta.

1895
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:48,019
Cecily: Thank you, Aunt Augusta.

1896
01:36:48,019 --> 01:36:51,449
Lady Bracknell: I do not approve of long engagements.

1897
01:36:51,449 --> 01:36:56,170
They give people a chance to find out about
each other's character before marriage, which

1898
01:36:56,170 --> 01:36:57,599
I think is never advisable.

1899
01:36:57,599 --> 01:37:03,660
Jack: I beg your pardon, Lady Bracknell, but
their engagement is not acceptable.

1900
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:09,619
I am Miss Cardew's guardian and she cannot
marry without my consent until she comes of

1901
01:37:09,619 --> 01:37:10,619
age.

1902
01:37:10,619 --> 01:37:12,309
I will not give my consent.

1903
01:37:12,309 --> 01:37:15,630
Lady Bracknell: Why, may I ask?

1904
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:18,570
Algernon is an extremely eligible young man.

1905
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:21,940
He has nothing, but he looks as if he has
everything.

1906
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:23,559
What more can one want?

1907
01:37:23,559 --> 01:37:29,199
Jack: I am very sorry to have to say this
to you, Lady Bracknell, but the fact is that

1908
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:32,400
I do not approve of his character.

1909
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,489
I suspect that he is devious.

1910
01:37:34,489 --> 01:37:37,989
(Algernon and Cecily look at him, amazed and
indignant)

1911
01:37:37,989 --> 01:37:39,159
Lady Bracknell: Devious?

1912
01:37:39,159 --> 01:37:40,330
My nephew Algernon?

1913
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:41,330
Impossible!

1914
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:43,179
He was educated at Oxford University.

1915
01:37:43,179 --> 01:37:46,980
Jack: There can be no doubt about it.

1916
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:52,849
This afternoon, while I was away in London,
he was allowed into this house because he

1917
01:37:52,849 --> 01:37:55,390
said he was my brother.

1918
01:37:55,390 --> 01:38:02,770
While pretending to be my brother, he drank,
I am informed by my servant, a complete bottle

1919
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:09,099
of very good quality champagne which I was
keeping especially for myself.

1920
01:38:09,099 --> 01:38:13,940
He also succeeded in turning my ward against
me.

1921
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:19,760
He then stayed to tea and ate every muffin
we had.

1922
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,619
He behaved completely heartlessly.

1923
01:38:23,619 --> 01:38:31,070
And what is worse, he knew that I don't have
a brother, that I have never had a brother

1924
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:35,969
and that I don't intend to ever have a brother
of any kind.

1925
01:38:35,969 --> 01:38:41,409
He knew because I told him so myself yesterday
afternoon.

1926
01:38:41,409 --> 01:38:43,659
Lady Bracknell: (Coughing) Ahem!

1927
01:38:43,659 --> 01:38:50,699
Mr Worthing, after thinking about this carefully,
I have decided to forget about the way my

1928
01:38:50,699 --> 01:38:53,139
nephew behaved towards you.

1929
01:38:53,139 --> 01:38:56,610
Jack: That is very good of you, Lady Bracknell.

1930
01:38:56,610 --> 01:39:01,219
I have decided, however, not to change my
mind.

1931
01:39:01,219 --> 01:39:03,499
I will not give my consent.

1932
01:39:03,499 --> 01:39:06,119
Lady Bracknell: (To Cecily) Come here, sweet
child.

1933
01:39:06,119 --> 01:39:09,350
(Cecily goes to her) How old are you, my dear?

1934
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:14,550
Cecily: Well, I am really only eighteen, but
I always say I am twenty when I go to parties.

1935
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:18,199
Lady Bracknell: You are perfectly right to
make a small alteration.

1936
01:39:18,199 --> 01:39:22,699
Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate
about her age.

1937
01:39:22,699 --> 01:39:24,119
It looks so devious.

1938
01:39:24,119 --> 01:39:28,730
(Speaking again, thoughtfully) Well, it will
not be very long before you come of age.

1939
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:33,679
So I don't think your guardian's consent is
very important.

1940
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:37,630
Jack: Excuse me for interrupting you again,
Lady Bracknell.

1941
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:44,750
I must tell you that, according to her grandfather's
will, Miss Cardew does not come of age until

1942
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:45,750
she is thirty-five.

1943
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:49,510
Lady Bracknell: That does not seem to me to
be a problem.

1944
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:53,050
Thirty-five is a very attractive age.

1945
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:59,070
London society is full of women who have,
by their own free choice, remained thirty-five

1946
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:00,349
for years.

1947
01:40:00,349 --> 01:40:02,489
Lady Dumbleton is an example.

1948
01:40:02,489 --> 01:40:08,499
She has been thirty-five ever since she reached
the age of forty, which was many years ago.

1949
01:40:08,499 --> 01:40:15,489
Our dear Cecily will be even more attractive
at the age of thirty-five than she is at present.

1950
01:40:15,489 --> 01:40:19,530
She will have even more money then than she
has now.

1951
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:22,979
Cecily: Algy, could you wait for me till I
was thirty-five?

1952
01:40:22,979 --> 01:40:25,210
Algernon: Of course I could, Cecily.

1953
01:40:25,210 --> 01:40:26,820
You know I could.

1954
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:31,690
Cecily: Yes, I believe that you could, but
I couldn't wait all that time.

1955
01:40:31,690 --> 01:40:34,570
I hate waiting even five minutes for anybody.

1956
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:37,080
It always makes me rather cross.

1957
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:40,760
I am not punctual myself but I do like other
people to be punctual.

1958
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:45,349
Waiting, even to be married, is quite out
of the question.

1959
01:40:45,349 --> 01:40:48,380
Algernon: Then what are we going to do, Cecily?

1960
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:51,059
Cecily: I don't know, Mr Moncrieff.

1961
01:40:51,059 --> 01:40:57,579
Lady Bracknell: My dear Mr Worthing, Miss
Cardew states that she cannot wait till she

1962
01:40:57,579 --> 01:41:03,349
is thirty-five - a remark that tells me she
has a rather impatient nature - however, I

1963
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:06,599
beg of you to think again about your decision.

1964
01:41:06,599 --> 01:41:13,330
Jack: My dear Lady Bracknell, the decision
is entirely in your own hands.

1965
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:19,960
When you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen,
I will gladly consent to your nephew's marriage

1966
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:20,960
with my ward.

1967
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:24,079
Lady Bracknell: (Standing and looking very
tall) You must know that your marriage with

1968
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:26,719
my daughter is not possible.

1969
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:30,639
Jack: Then none of us can look forward to
ever getting married.

1970
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:34,100
Lady Bracknell: I cannot agree to Gwendolen
never getting married.

1971
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:36,550
Algernon, of course, may choose for himself.

1972
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:41,530
Come, dear, (Gwendolen stands up) we have
already missed five, if not six, trains.

1973
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:43,460
(Canon Chasuble enters)

1974
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:46,699
Chasuble: Everything is quite ready for the
baptisms.

1975
01:41:46,699 --> 01:41:48,630
Lady Bracknell: The baptisms?

1976
01:41:48,630 --> 01:41:50,750
Is it not a little early for baptisms?

1977
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:53,449
First marriage, then children, then baptisms!

1978
01:41:53,449 --> 01:41:58,830
Chasuble: (Looking puzzled, and pointing at
Jack and Algernon) Both these gentlemen have

1979
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:01,090
said they wish to be baptized immediately.

1980
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:03,050
Lady Bracknell: Baptized?

1981
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:05,010
At their age?

1982
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:08,019
The idea is ridiculous and quite irreligious.

1983
01:42:08,019 --> 01:42:11,510
Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized.

1984
01:42:11,510 --> 01:42:16,849
My husband, Lord Bracknell, would be very
displeased to hear that you were wasting your

1985
01:42:16,849 --> 01:42:18,389
time and money like this.

1986
01:42:18,389 --> 01:42:21,369
Chasuble: Do I understand you correctly?

1987
01:42:21,369 --> 01:42:24,270
Is neither of you gentlemen to be baptized?

1988
01:42:24,270 --> 01:42:29,320
Jack: I don't think that baptism would be
much use to either of us at the moment, Canon

1989
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:30,320
Chasuble.

1990
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:34,909
Chasuble: I am very sorry to hear you say
so, Mr Worthing.

1991
01:42:34,909 --> 01:42:38,070
That sounds like the view of an irreligious
man.

1992
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:42,900
I have written four unpublished sermons on
this subject.

1993
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:49,949
However, since you have decided to ignore
religion for now, I will return to the church

1994
01:42:49,949 --> 01:42:53,780
where Miss Prism has been waiting for me for
an hour and a half.

1995
01:42:53,780 --> 01:42:55,869
Lady Bracknell: (Looking shocked and sitting
down again) Miss Prism?

1996
01:42:55,869 --> 01:42:59,729
Did I hear you say 'Miss Prism'?

1997
01:42:59,729 --> 01:43:02,130
Chasuble: Yes, Lady Bracknell.

1998
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:04,710
I am going to the church to join her now.

1999
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:07,539
Lady Bracknell: Please wait a moment, Canon
Chasuble.

2000
01:43:07,539 --> 01:43:12,409
This is something which may be important to
Lord Bracknell and myself.

2001
01:43:12,409 --> 01:43:17,730
Is this Miss Prism a rather ugly female who
is remotely connected with education?

2002
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:21,550
Chasuble: (Rather indignantly) She is a very
respectable lady.

2003
01:43:21,550 --> 01:43:24,610
Lady Bracknell: It must be the same person.

2004
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:27,709
May I ask what position she has in your household?

2005
01:43:27,709 --> 01:43:30,929
Chasuble: (Severely) I am celibate, madam.

2006
01:43:30,929 --> 01:43:37,909
Jack: Lady Bracknell, Miss Prism has been
Miss Cardew's valued governess and companion

2007
01:43:37,909 --> 01:43:39,280
for the last three years.

2008
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,360
Lady Bracknell: I must see her at once.

2009
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,940
Let her be sent for.

2010
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:44,489
Chasuble: (Looking offstage) She's approaching.

2011
01:43:44,489 --> 01:43:45,489
She's nearly here.

2012
01:43:45,489 --> 01:43:46,980
(Miss Prism enters very quickly)

2013
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:50,489
Miss Prism: I was told you were coming to
the church, dear canon.

2014
01:43:50,489 --> 01:43:54,030
I have been waiting there for an hour and
three-quarters.

2015
01:43:54,030 --> 01:43:55,380
(Seeing Lady Bracknell, who is glaring at
her, Miss Prism turns pale.

2016
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:57,849
She looks round her as if she wants to escape)

2017
01:43:57,849 --> 01:44:06,510
Lady Bracknell: (In a severe voice, as if
she is a lawyer in a courtroom) Prism!

2018
01:44:06,510 --> 01:44:08,310
(Miss Prism lowers her head, looking ashamed)
Come here, Prism!

2019
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:09,310
(Miss Prism approaches looking nervous) Prism!

2020
01:44:09,310 --> 01:44:10,310
Where is that baby?

2021
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:11,310
(Everyone looks horrified.

2022
01:44:11,310 --> 01:44:12,310
The canon takes a step backwards.

2023
01:44:12,310 --> 01:44:13,310
Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to
stop Gwendolen and Cecily from hearing something

2024
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:14,690
shocking) Prism, twenty-eight years ago, you
left Lord Bracknell's house, Number 104, Upper

2025
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:20,420
Grosvenor Square, London, in charge of a pram
containing a baby boy.

2026
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,639
You never returned.

2027
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:30,260
A few weeks later, after a police investigation,
the pram was discovered at midnight in a remote

2028
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:31,929
part of the city.

2029
01:44:31,929 --> 01:44:36,929
It contained the manuscript of a very bad
three-volume novel.

2030
01:44:36,929 --> 01:44:39,969
(Miss Prism looks indignant) But the baby
was not there.

2031
01:44:39,969 --> 01:44:43,870
(Everyone looks at Miss Prism) Prism, where
is that baby?

2032
01:44:43,870 --> 01:44:45,270
(There is a pause)

2033
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:51,239
Miss Prism: Lady Bracknell, I am ashamed to
say I don't know.

2034
01:44:51,239 --> 01:44:53,219
I wish I did.

2035
01:44:53,219 --> 01:44:54,969
These are the facts.

2036
01:44:54,969 --> 01:45:01,719
On the morning of that day, a day I will remember
forever, I prepared as usual to take the baby

2037
01:45:01,719 --> 01:45:03,369
out in the pram.

2038
01:45:03,369 --> 01:45:09,260
I had with me a large old handbag in which
I had intended to put the manuscript of a

2039
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:11,730
three-volume novel that I had written.

2040
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:19,280
In a moment of forgetfulness, for which I
can never forgive myself, I put the manuscript

2041
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:22,459
in the pram and the baby in the handbag.

2042
01:45:22,459 --> 01:45:27,840
Jack: (Who had been listening very carefully)
But where did you put the handbag?

2043
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:32,459
Miss Prism: Do not ask me, Mr Worthing.

2044
01:45:32,459 --> 01:45:37,760
Jack: Miss Prism, this is very important to
me.

2045
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:44,219
I must know where you put the handbag which
contained the baby.

2046
01:45:44,219 --> 01:45:52,270
Miss Prism: I left it in the cloakroom of
one of the larger railway stations in London.

2047
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:53,619
Jack: Which railway station?

2048
01:45:53,619 --> 01:45:55,639
Miss Prism: (Looking very miserable) Victoria.

2049
01:45:55,639 --> 01:45:57,659
(Sitting down slowly on an armchair)

2050
01:45:57,659 --> 01:46:00,650
Jack: I must go to my bedroom for a moment.

2051
01:46:00,650 --> 01:46:02,360
Gwendolen, wait for me here.

2052
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:05,670
Gwendolen: If you are not too long, I will
wait for you all my life.

2053
01:46:05,670 --> 01:46:07,349
(Jack leaves, very excited)

2054
01:46:07,349 --> 01:46:09,940
Chasuble: What do you think this means, Lady
Bracknell?

2055
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:13,380
Lady Bracknell: I dare not guess, Canon Chasuble.

2056
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:18,389
You must know that strange coincidences are
not supposed to happen in families with a

2057
01:46:18,389 --> 01:46:21,780
high position in society like ours.

2058
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:22,780
They are not appropriate.

2059
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:26,230
(Noises are heard above as if someone is throwing
boxes around.

2060
01:46:26,230 --> 01:46:27,239
Everyone looks up)

2061
01:46:27,239 --> 01:46:29,260
Cecily: Uncle Jack sounds very agitated.

2062
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:31,860
Lady Bracknell: The noise is extremely unpleasant.

2063
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:33,929
Chasuble: (Looking up) It has stopped now.

2064
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:35,999
(The noises start again, sounding even louder)

2065
01:46:35,999 --> 01:46:38,550
Lady Bracknell: I wish he would stop.

2066
01:46:38,550 --> 01:46:41,440
Gwendolen: The suspense is terrible.

2067
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:42,440
I hope it will last.

2068
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:43,510
(Jack enters, with a black leather handbag
in his hand)

2069
01:46:43,510 --> 01:46:47,710
Jack: (Rushing over to Miss Prism) Is this
the handbag, Miss Prism?

2070
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:51,679
Examine it carefully before you speak.

2071
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:55,449
The happiness of more than one person depends
on your answer.

2072
01:46:55,449 --> 01:46:59,269
Miss Prism: (Calmly) It seems to be mine.

2073
01:46:59,269 --> 01:47:04,559
Yes, here is the damage which happened in
an accident on a bus.

2074
01:47:04,559 --> 01:47:08,880
Here is the stain caused by a drink which
exploded at Leamington.

2075
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,369
And here, near the lock, are my initials.

2076
01:47:12,369 --> 01:47:15,199
I had forgotten that I had had them put there.

2077
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:17,860
The bag is definitely mine.

2078
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:20,420
I am delighted to have it returned to me so
unexpectedly.

2079
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:22,393
It has been inconvenient not to have it all
these years.

2080
01:47:22,393 --> 01:47:30,380
Jack: (In a pathetic voice) Miss Prism, you
have had more returned to you than the handbag.

2081
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:33,499
I was the baby you placed in it.

2082
01:47:33,499 --> 01:47:34,510
Miss Prism: (Amazed) You?

2083
01:47:34,510 --> 01:47:35,510
Jack: (Embracing her) Yes...

2084
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:36,510
Mother!

2085
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:39,150
Miss Prism: (Pulling away from him indignantly)
Mr Worthing, I am unmarried.

2086
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:40,610
Jack: Unmarried!

2087
01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:43,130
That is a serious problem.

2088
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:47,079
But who has the right to speak badly of someone
who has suffered?

2089
01:47:47,079 --> 01:47:50,280
Why should society treat men and women differently?

2090
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,539
Mother, I forgive you.

2091
01:47:51,539 --> 01:47:52,539
(Trying to embrace her again)

2092
01:47:52,539 --> 01:47:53,579
Miss Prism: (Now even more indignant) Mr Worthing,
you are wrong.

2093
01:47:53,579 --> 01:47:58,140
(Pointing to Lady Bracknell) There is the
lady who can tell you who you really are.

2094
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:04,219
Jack: (After a pause) Lady Bracknell, would
you kindly inform me who I am?

2095
01:48:04,219 --> 01:48:08,840
Lady Bracknell: I am afraid that my news may
not please you.

2096
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:16,960
You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs Moncrieff,
and therefore Algernon's elder brother.

2097
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:19,520
Jack: Algy's elder brother!

2098
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:22,469
Then I have a brother after all.

2099
01:48:22,469 --> 01:48:24,239
I knew I had a brother!

2100
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:26,449
I always said I had a brother!

2101
01:48:26,449 --> 01:48:29,229
Cecily - how could you ever have doubted that
I had a brother?

2102
01:48:29,229 --> 01:48:31,880
(Getting hold of Algernon and leading him
around the room) Canon Chasuble, here is my

2103
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,590
unfortunate brother.

2104
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:35,739
Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother.

2105
01:48:35,739 --> 01:48:37,969
Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother.

2106
01:48:37,969 --> 01:48:41,789
Algy, you will have to treat me with more
respect in the future.

2107
01:48:41,789 --> 01:48:44,519
You have never behaved to me like a younger
brother should.

2108
01:48:44,519 --> 01:48:47,119
Algernon: Well, I haven't done until today.

2109
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:48,119
I did my best, though.

2110
01:48:48,119 --> 01:48:49,119
(They shake hands)

2111
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:53,900
Gwendolen: (To Jack) My own - but my own - what?

2112
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:57,650
What is your name, now that you are not Jack
Worthing?

2113
01:48:57,650 --> 01:48:59,380
Jack: Good heavens!

2114
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:01,679
I had forgotten about my name.

2115
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:05,719
I suppose that you won't change your mind
about your favourite name?

2116
01:49:05,719 --> 01:49:06,719
Gwendolen: Never!

2117
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:10,500
Jack: Then the question must be cleared up
at once.

2118
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,400
Aunt Augusta, had I been baptized?

2119
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:18,270
Lady Bracknell: Your loving parents had done
everything for you, including baptism.

2120
01:49:18,270 --> 01:49:20,449
Jack: Then I was baptized!

2121
01:49:20,449 --> 01:49:21,989
That is clear.

2122
01:49:21,989 --> 01:49:24,480
Now what name was I given?

2123
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,749
Let me know the worst!

2124
01:49:25,749 --> 01:49:30,780
Lady Bracknell: You were the elder son so
you were given your father's name.

2125
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:34,179
Jack: (Irritably) Yes, but what was my father's
name?

2126
01:49:34,179 --> 01:49:40,340
Lady Bracknell: (Thoughtfully) I cannot at
present remember what the general's name was.

2127
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:43,070
But I have no doubt that he had one.

2128
01:49:43,070 --> 01:49:44,070
Jack: Algy!

2129
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:46,389
Can't you remember what our father's name
was?

2130
01:49:46,389 --> 01:49:49,810
Algernon: My dear fellow, we never even spoke
to each other.

2131
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:51,909
He died before I was a year old.

2132
01:49:51,909 --> 01:49:56,209
Jack: His name will appear in the Army Lists
of that period, I suppose, Aunt Augusta?

2133
01:49:56,209 --> 01:50:00,999
Lady Bracknell: The general was a man of peace,
except in his domestic life.

2134
01:50:00,999 --> 01:50:04,849
So I have no doubt that his name will appear
in an Army List.

2135
01:50:04,849 --> 01:50:09,040
Jack: The Army Lists for the last forty years
are here.

2136
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,750
I should have read them all!

2137
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:18,409
(Rushes over to a bookcase and pulls lots
of books out) Mmm... generals...

2138
01:50:18,409 --> 01:50:24,130
Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley - what awful names
they have - Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff!

2139
01:50:24,130 --> 01:50:30,860
Lieutenant: 1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel,
Colonel, General: 1869: names Ernest John.

2140
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:41,289
(Putting down the book and speaking quite
calmly) I always told you, Gwendolen, that

2141
01:50:41,289 --> 01:50:43,570
my name was Ernest, didn't I?

2142
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:46,190
Well, it is Ernest after all.

2143
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:48,110
I mean it really is Ernest.

2144
01:50:48,110 --> 01:50:53,909
Lady Bracknell: Yes, I remember now that the
general called you Ernest.

2145
01:50:53,909 --> 01:50:56,969
I knew I had a reason for disliking that name.

2146
01:50:56,969 --> 01:50:58,429
Gwendolen: Ernest!

2147
01:50:58,429 --> 01:51:00,619
My own Ernest!

2148
01:51:00,619 --> 01:51:05,860
I felt from the first time I met you that
you could have no other name!

2149
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:11,469
Jack: Gwendolen, it is terrible for a man
to find out suddenly that he has been speaking

2150
01:51:11,469 --> 01:51:14,119
the truth all his life.

2151
01:51:14,119 --> 01:51:15,119
Can you forgive me?

2152
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:16,630
Gwendolen: I can.

2153
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:18,489
Because I feel that you are going to change.

2154
01:51:18,489 --> 01:51:19,969
Jack: My own darling!

2155
01:51:19,969 --> 01:51:22,199
Chasuble: (To Miss Prism) Laetitia!

2156
01:51:22,199 --> 01:51:23,199
(Embracing her)

2157
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:24,880
Miss Prism: (Enthusiastically) Frederick!

2158
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:25,880
At last!

2159
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:26,880
Algernon: Cecily!

2160
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,439
(Embracing her) At last!

2161
01:51:28,439 --> 01:51:29,439
Jack: Gwendolen!

2162
01:51:29,439 --> 01:51:30,820
(Embracing her) At last!

2163
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:37,329
Lady Bracknell: My nephew, you seem to be
displaying signs of a lack of seriousness.

2164
01:51:37,329 --> 01:51:44,429
Jack: On the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I've
now realized for the first time in my life

2165
01:51:44,429 --> 01:52:32,530
the Importance of Being Earnest.
