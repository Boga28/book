00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,040
Farmer and Soldier

3
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,399
At the height of its power, the great Roman Empire stretched from the deserts of Africa to the borders of northern
England.

4
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
Over one quarter of the world's population lived and died
under the rule of the Caesars.

5
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
In the winter of A.

6
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
D. 180, Emperor Marcus Aurelius's twelve - year war against
the people of Germania was coming to an end.

7
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
There was one last battle to win.

8
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
Then there would be peace across the Roman Empire.

9
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
The man walked through the sun-warmed Spanish field, his
hand touching the wheat.

10
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
He looked past apple trees to a farmhouse.

11
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
He heard a child laughing somewhere near.

12
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
A bird flew onto the branch of a tree close to him and they
looked at each other.

13
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
The man smiled.

14
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
Suddenly, the sound of shouts and horses frightened the bird
and it flew up into the air.

15
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
The noise broke through the man's daydream and he came back
to the real world with a crash.

16
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
He was not dressed in farmer's clothes, as he had imagined,
but in the proud armor of the Roman army.

17
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
The field was burnt and muddy from battle, without a green
leaf on it.

18
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
Beyond the tree line ahead, somewhere in the forest, the
German armies were preparing to attack again.

19
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
The man knew that behind him an enormous army waited.

20
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,399
The Roman army, 40,000 men, his army.

21
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,719
Maximus the farmer was Maximus the Commanding General of the
Army of the North for one more battle.

22
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:07,160
One last battle, and then he could go home to Spain.

23
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,960
He turned his horse and rode back to his men.

24
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,720
Thirty-year-old Maximus was a great general-a man they could
trust.

25
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,800
He moved among them, checking that they were ready for
battle.

26
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,839
He looked back frequently to the line of trees.

27
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,800
Some of his officers were warming themselves around a fire,
and Maximus joined them.

28
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:43,920
"Still nothing?" he asked Quintus, his second-in-command.

29
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,200
Quintus shook his head.

30
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,039
"He's been gone for almost two hours," he said.

31
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:46,439
"Why are they taking so long? They only have to say yes or
no."

32
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,880
A young officer gave Maximus a bowl of hot soup.

33
00:00:47,880 --> 00:01:12,799
He drank it slowly as they talked, always keeping one eye on
the line of trees.

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,680
"Snow in the air," said Maximus.

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:25,840
"I can smell it."

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:45,760
"Anything's better than this German rain," Quintus said,
looking out at the mud in front of his men.

37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,599
Suddenly, there was a shout.

38
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,040
"He's coming!"

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,840
All eyes turned to the trees.

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,640
A horseman rode out, toward the Roman army.

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,719
There was something strange about the way he was riding.

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Maximus was the first to understand.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,879
"They say no," he said.

44
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,599
As the horse came closer, the other men could see what had
happened.

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,079
The Roman messenger was tied to his horse.

46
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,800
His head had been cut off.

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,080
Maximus knew now what he had to do.

48
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,759
Life was suddenly simple.

49
00:02:12,759 --> 00:05:07,680
Far away, at the edge of the trees, a German chief appeared.

50
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,519
In one hand he was holding the head of the messenger.

51
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:18,000
He screamed his anger at the Roman army, then threw the head
toward them.

52
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,959
Maximus's men stared back and waited for their general's
order to attack.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,319
Several carriages traveled along the road toward the battle
area, protected by Roman soldiers.

54
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,399
Inside the first carriage were the royal family-the
Emperor's son and daughter.

55
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:40,240
Twenty-eight-year- old Commodus and his beautiful older
sister Lucilla were dressed in rich, warm clothes.

56
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,439
They had left Rome two weeks before.

57
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,079
"Do you think he's really dying?" Commodus asked Lucilla.

58
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,120
"He's been dying for ten years," she replied.

59
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,120
"I think he's really sick this time. And he's sent for us."
He pointed to the following carriages.

60
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,720
"He sent for the senators, too. If he isn't dying, why does
he want to see them?"

61
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,360
"Commodus, you're giving me a headache. Two weeks on the
road with you is more than enough," said Lucilla,
impatiently.

62
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,279
Commodus moved closer to her.

63
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,160
"No, he's made his decision," he said.

64
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:20,680
"He will name me as Emperor. And I know what I shall do
first. I shall organize some games..."

65
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,360
"I shall have a hot bath," said Lucilla.

66
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,720
The carriage stopped.

67
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,839
Commodus stepped down and spoke to one of the guards.

68
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:48,360
"We are almost there, sir."

69
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,160
"Good," said Commodus.

70
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,759
"Bring me my horse."

71
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,279
Under his warm traveling coat Commodus was wearing Roman
armor.

72
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,120
He looked handsome and brave, the perfect picture of a new,
young emperor.

73
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,199
The guard brought Commodus his horse.

74
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:08,160
"Take me to my father. And take my sister to the camp."
Commodus reached out a hand to Lucilla.

75
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,160
"Kiss," he said, smiling like a little boy.

76
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,120
Lucilla brushed his fingers with her lips, then watched him
ride away.

77
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,000
Marcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome, sat on his horse and
stared at the army below.

78
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,439
His hair and beard were white, but only his eyes really
showed his age and state of health.

79
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,240
Marcus knew he was dying and soon he must name the next
emperor.

80
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,399
But first this battle must be won.

81
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,160
From another hill, Maximus also looked down onto the Roman
army.

82
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,839
His men were ready to fight.

83
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,040
The German soldiers started to move out from the trees.

84
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,600
There were thousands of them, dressed in animal skins,
shouting at their Roman enemies.

85
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,199
Maximus bent down from his horse and took some earth in his
hands, as he did before every battle.

86
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,480
Then he let it fall through his fingers.

87
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:56,800
It was a sign his men had seen many times before and they
knew what it meant.

88
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,480
Maximus gave the command and a flaming arrow shot into the
sky.

89
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,959
Hundreds more followed.

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,199
Thousands of German soldiers rushed forward and met the
first line of Romans.

91
00:08:06,199 --> 00:09:59,960
The air was filled with the sound of screaming as more
arrows landed and men from both armies died terrible deaths.

92
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Maximus led soldiers on horseback into the battle at the same time as 5,000 Roman foot soldiers moved forward from
another side.

93
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Each man marched behind a large shield, each carried a
sword.

94
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
The Germans were caught between two walls of death.

95
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Above them the sky was full of flaming arrows.

96
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
They were fighting for their lives.

97
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Suddenly, Maximus was trapped between two Germans.

98
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
He swung his sword around in a circle, striking both men
dead.

99
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Then he rode forward again, and his sword cut through the
enemy soldiers in his path.

100
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Maximus's horse suddenly fell forward, a German sword in its
neck.

101
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
The General flew over his horse's head and crashed to the
ground.

102
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
There was danger all around him, but he continued fighting.

103
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
He found the Roman flag, still in the hand of a dead
soldier, and held it high.

104
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
His men fought their way toward it and defended their
position bravely.

105
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
More and more Roman soldiers moved forward onto the
battleground.

106
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
They were well-trained and had the best equipment and armor.

107
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
The Germans were not as good as the confident Roman army and
finally they began to tire.

108
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Maximus saw that he was winning and moved up a little higher
on the hill.

109
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
From there he could see and command his men better.

110
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
The enemy began to lose confidence and some turned and ran.

111
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
More joined them and soon the only Germans on the
battlefield were dead or dying.

112
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Maximus went back down and walked among them.

113
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
As he stepped over bodies, he began to relax and let his
sword arm fall to his side.

114
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Behind him, a dying German suddenly lifted himself from the
ground and rushed forward with his sword.

115
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Maximus was calling an order to one of his officers when he saw the sudden look of terror on the officer's face and
immediately swung his sword around, cutting off his attacker's head.

116
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,960
There was so much power behind the sword that it flew from
his hand and landed in a tree.

117
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,000
Maximus had no strength left to pull it out again.

118
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The battle had ended.

119
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
As he looked at the dead around him, he could only think
that his men had won, and he had lived.

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
CHAPTER TWO

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The Last Battle

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Emperor Marcus Aurelius sat on his horse, on the top of the
command hill, with guards on each side to protect him.

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He watched as the battle slowly progressed and it became
clear that the Roman army had won.

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Marcus hoped it would be many years before they had to go to
war again, certainly not before he died.

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He had no wish to see another battle.

126
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He turned to his guards.

127
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
"I will leave now," he said.

128
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
"I have seen enough."

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Maximus looked at his sword in the tree.

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
His face was covered with blood and mud.

131
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,720
The beat of his heart was beginning to slow down as the
noise of the battle became quieter.

132
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:17,200
There were other sounds now-screams from the dying and cries
for help.

133
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,639
A small bird flew down from the top of the tree and sat on
Maximus's sword.

134
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,200
Could it possibly be the same bird he had seen before the
first explosion of battle?

135
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,519
That seemed like a hundred years ago.

136
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,080
He shook his head and reached for the sword.

137
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,039
The frightened bird flew away as Maximus pulled his sword
out of the tree.

138
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Across the field, doctors were trying to help any Roman
soldiers who were still alive.

139
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,320
Other soldiers were walking slowly through the men on the ground, looking for Germans left alive and killing them
quickly.

140
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:54,639
Maximus walked back toward the command point, sometimes stopping to speak to a dying soldier, sometimes calling for
water or medical help.

141
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,600
He came to a low hill where the bodies of Roman soldiers had
been placed, side by side.

142
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
"Let the sun always be warm on your back," he said softly.

143
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,120
"You've come home at last."

144
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,000
"You're a brave man, Maximus, and a good commander," said a
voice behind him.

145
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,600
"Let us hope it is for the last time."

146
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,840
Maximus turned and saw the Emperor.

147
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,919
"There's no one left to fight, sir," he said.

148
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,159
"There are always people to fight. More glory."

149
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:26,399
"The glory is theirs, Caesar," said Maximus, looking at the
lines of dead soldiers.

150
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,319
"Tell me," said Marcus.

151
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,080
"How can I reward Rome's greatest general?"

152
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,399
"Let me go home," replied Maximus, quickly.

153
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,879
"Ah, home..." said Marcus.

154
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,519
He gave his arm to Maximus, and they walked together back
across the battlefield.

155
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,279
All eyes followed the long purple coat and white hair of
their emperor.

156
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,399
They could see that he moved slowly and with difficulty.

157
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,919
He was clearly in pain.

158
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,279
Most of the soldiers realized that they were probably seeing
him for the last time.

159
00:11:54,279 --> 00:13:02,000
And they knew Rome was not likely to have such a good
emperor again.

160
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Marcus Aurelius and his general walked along the road, past
lines of tired soldiers.

161
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:12,200
Hundreds of men resting on a hill stood and raised their
swords high in the air when they saw them pass.

162
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,799
"They honor you, Caesar," said Maximus.

163
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,639
"No, Maximus, I believe they honor you," replied the
Emperor.

164
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,840
Maximus looked across at the crowd of brave men and raised
his own sword.

165
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,519
The men cheered him loudly.

166
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,039
Suddenly, Prince Commodus and his guards rode into view.

167
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,799
When he heard the cheering and saw the reason for it,
Commodus was filled with jealousy.

168
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,360
Roman soldiers were honoring a Spaniard above the Emperor
and his family-it was not right.

169
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,360
But he tried to look pleased as he rode up to Marcus and
Maximus.

170
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,120
"Have I missed the battle?" he said, jumping from his horse.

171
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,480
"You've missed the war," said Marcus.

172
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,120
"We're finished here."

173
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,680
Commodus put his arms around his father.

174
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,600
"Father, congratulations," he said.

175
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,799
"I shall kill a hundred animals to honor your success."

176
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:01,319
"Let the animals live and honor Maximus," said Marcus.

177
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:03,000
"He won the battle."

178
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,879
"General," Commodus said, turning to Maximus, "Rome salutes you, and I salute you as a brother." He opened his arms and
put them around Maximus.

179
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:19,319
"It has been too long since we last met. How long? Ten
years, my old friend?" Commodus turned to Marcus.

180
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:21,960
"Here, Father, take my arm."

181
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Marcus let his hand rest on his son for a minute, then said,
"I think maybe I should leave you now."

182
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,720
Commodus called for Marcus's horse and some of the guards
ran forward to help him.

183
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,920
The old man waved them away and looked at Maximus.

184
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,920
Maximus came quickly to his side and helped him onto the
horse.

185
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,680
Without a word to his son he rode slowly away.

186
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,639
Commodus and Maximus stood together and watched the Emperor
go, each thinking their own thoughts about him.

187
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,839
Marcus had won many battles for the glory of Rome, but
Maximus would always remember him first as a good man.

188
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,039
Commodus's thoughts were very different.

189
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,600
He was angry that his father had not put his arms around
him.

190
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,200
He was jealous because Maximus was asked to help Marcus onto
the horse and the Emperor had spoken privately to him.

191
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,839
He swung himself back onto his horse and rode away, followed
by his guards.

192
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,360
A city of hospital tents had been built.

193
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,879
There were thousands of wounded Roman soldiers, and the
doctors were busy all night.

194
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,160
Maximus came out of one of the tents.

195
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,639
He was sad that so many men were badly hurt, and he knew
that many more would not live until morning.

196
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,319
He turned and walked back to the main camp.

197
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,399
In the biggest tent many of the officers were celebrating.

198
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,839
There was wine and food; they were laughing and shouting.

199
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,399
These were the lucky men who had cheated death.

200
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,319
The Emperor sat in a chair in the center of the tent and
received visitors.

201
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:45,680
Two senators, Falco and Gaius, had just arrived.

202
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,839
"We greet you, Marcus Aurelius," Falco said.

203
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,200
"And we bring greetings from Senator Gracchus. He waits to
honor you when you return to Rome."

204
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,240
When Maximus entered the tent, officers came forward to meet
him.

205
00:15:58,240 --> 00:19:59,960
Someone gave him wine, others held their hands out to him,
Quintus stopped his conversation when he saw his friend.

206
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"Still alive! The gods must love you!" they both said
together, laughing.

207
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Maximus moved through the tent, with Quintus and some of his
other officers following behind.

208
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Through the forest of men Maximus could see Marcus Aurelius
surrounded by a group of people.

209
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
As he got nearer, he saw Commodus at the Emperor's side,
with the two senators.

210
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Maximus paused to speak to another officer.

211
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"Back to Rome now, General?" the man asked.

212
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"I'm going home," Maximus said.

213
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"To my wife, my son, and my fields of wheat."

214
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"Maximus the farmer!" Quintus said, laughing.

215
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"I still can't imagine that."

216
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"Dirt washes off more easily than blood, Quintus," replied
Maximus.

217
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Commodus, Gaius, and Falco came toward Maximus.

218
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"Here he is," said Commodus.

219
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"The hero of the war!"

220
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Maximus was not happy that Commodus had said this in front
of his brave officers.

221
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
To him they were all heroes.

222
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Commodus introduced the two senators.

223
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
They were smart politicians and they saw that Maximus could
have an interesting future in Rome.

224
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
The real power was not with the Emperor.

225
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
It was with whoever had control of the army.

226
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Commodus led Maximus away to a quieter corner.

227
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
He spoke softly.

228
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"Times are changing, General. I'm going to need good men
like you."

229
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"How can I help, sir?"

230
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"You're a man who can command. You give orders, the men follow your orders, the battle is won." Commodus looked
across at the senators.

231
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"We must save Rome from the politicians, my friend. Will you
be with me when the time comes?"

232
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,960
"When your father allows me to go, I will return to Spain,
sir," said Maximus.

233
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,000
"Home? Ah yes. But don't get too comfortable-I may call on you soon." Then, seeming suddenly to remember, Commodus
said, "Lucilla is here. Did you know? She hasn't forgotten you- and now you are the great hero." He turned away to watch his father leaving the tent with his guards.

234
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
"Caesar will sleep early tonight," he said.

235
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
When he turned back again, Maximus had gone.

236
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Commodus was anxious.

237
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Who did the great general really support?

238
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Could he be trusted?

239
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Commodus took some more wine and thought carefully about
Maximus.

240
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Marcus's slaves helped him into the royal tent.

241
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Lucilla was already there.

242
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
"It's a pity I only have one son," Marcus said to her.

243
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
"You would be a better Caesar than Commodus... stronger. I
wonder if you would also be fair?"

244
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
"I would be whatever you taught me to be," she replied,
smiling.

245
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
She came to his side and kissed him.

246
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
"How was the trip?" Marcus asked.

247
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
"Long. Boring. Why have I come?" asked Lucilla.

248
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
"I need your help," said her father.

249
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
"With your brother. He loves you-he always has. Soon he is going to need you more than ever." Lucilla did not know what
to say.

250
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
"No more. It is not a night for politics," Marcus said.

251
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
"It is a night for an old man and his daughter to look at the moon together. Let us pretend that you are a loving
daughter and I am a good father."

252
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Lucilla took his arm and they walked together into the cold
night air.

253
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
"This is a pleasant fiction" she said, smiling at him.

254
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Lucilla understood him.

255
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
She knew that her father would love to be just a simple old
man sharing a little time with his daughter.

256
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But he was Emperor of Rome, and for him life was much more
complicated.

257
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
In the cold morning, at the edge of the forest, a group of
men were training for battle.

258
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Commodus and his guards were practicing sword fighting,
striking at small trees.

259
00:20:00,000 --> 00:23:33,200
The young prince was proud of his body.

260
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,720
He was strong and healthy as a result of the strict training
he did every morning.

261
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,639
His training program was taken straight from the gladiator
schools, where men learned to fight for their lives.

262
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:49,400
His greatest wish was to fight against real gladiators,
although he knew that his father would never allow it.

263
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,799
Marcus had ended the tradition of gladiator fights in Rome.

264
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:58,680
Maximus passed by the small group of men in the early
morning light and noticed that the Emperor's son was among
them.

265
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,200
He was not surprised.

266
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,799
He had heard plenty of stories about Commodus, how strong
and skilled he was.

267
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,599
He had also heard that Commodus was a cruel man, but he
tried not to believe that.

268
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:13,480
There were always jealous people saying bad things about the
royal family.

269
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,720
Maximus walked to Marcus's tent.

270
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,400
The Emperor's guards let him through the entrance without
any questions.

271
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,960
They were expecting him.

272
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,079
CHAPTER THREE

273
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,279
One More Duty

274
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,599
The only light in the Emperor's tent came from oil lamps.

275
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,960
Marcus sat with his back to Maximus.

276
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,360
He was writing his diary and at first he did not realize
Maximus had arrived.

277
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,599
"Caesar. You sent for me," said Maximus.

278
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:39,680
Marcus, lost in his thoughts, did not reply.

279
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,960
"Caesar?" Maximus repeated.

280
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,960
"Tell me again, Maximus," Marcus said.

281
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,400
"Why are we here?"

282
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,839
"For the glory of the Empire, sir."

283
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,599
At first he thought Marcus had not heard him.

284
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:56,680
Then Marcus slowly got up from his desk and softly said,
"Yes, I remember..."

285
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,920
He walked over to a large map of the Roman Empire and waved
a hand across it.

286
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:10,839
"Do you see it, Maximus? This is the world I have made. For twenty years I have tried to be a student of life and of
men-but what have I really done?" He touched the map.

287
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:20,880
"For twenty years I have fought and won battles. I have defended the Empire and increased it. Since I became Caesar
I have only had four years of peace. And for what?"

288
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,759
"To make our borders safe," said Maximus.

289
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,960
"To bring teaching and law."

290
00:25:25,960 --> 00:26:24,920
"I brought the sword! Nothing more! And while I have fought,
Rome has grown fat and diseased. I did this. And nothing can change the fact that Rome is far away and we shouldn't be here."

291
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,079
"But Caesar ..." Maximus started, but Marcus interrupted
him.

292
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:31,400
"Don't call me that," he said.

293
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,960
"We have to talk together now. Very simply. Just as men. Can
we do that?"

294
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,680
"Forty thousand of my men are out there now, freezing in the
mud," said Maximus.

295
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:48,720
"Eight thousand are wounded and two thousand will never leave this place. I won't believe they fought and died for
nothing."

296
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:51,240
"What do you believe, Maximus?"

297
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,240
"That they fought for you-and for Rome," he replied.

298
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,440
"And what is Rome, Maximus? Tell me."

299
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:04,000
"I've seen too much of the rest of the world and I know it's
cruel and dark. I have to believe that Rome is the light."

300
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,839
"But you have never been there," said Marcus.

301
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,279
"You have not seen Rome as it is now."

302
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,720
Maximus had heard stories about Rome.

303
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,559
People in the cities were hungry and food prices were much
too high.

304
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,839
Some Romans had become very rich, but most were poor.

305
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,639
Bridges, roads, and ports all needed repairs, while tax
money went into the pockets of the rich.

306
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:27,639
There were many things wrong at the heart of the enormous
empire.

307
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:34,519
"I am dying, Maximus. And I want to see that there has been
some purpose to my life." Marcus sat down again.

308
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:46,319
"It's strange. I think more about the future than the present. How will the world speak my name in future years?"
He held out his hand to Maximus, who took it and came to sit next to Marcus.

309
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,639
"You have a son," said the Emperor.

310
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:52,079
"You must love him very much. Tell me about your home"

311
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:55,759
"The house is in the hills above Trujillo," Maximus began.

312
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:07,240
"It's a simple place, pink stones that warm in the sun. There's a wall, a gate, and a small field of vegetables."
Maximus looked up and saw that the old man had closed his eyes as he listened.

313
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,480
He was smiling.

314
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:19,400
"Through the gate are apple trees. The earth is black, Marcus. As black as my wife's hair. And we grow fruit and
vegetables. There are wild horses near the house-my son loves them."

315
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,160
"How long is it since you were last home?"

316
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,119
"Two years, two hundred sixty-four days-and one morning."

317
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,279
Marcus laughed.

318
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:34,960
"I am jealous of you, Maximus. Your home is good-something to fight for. I have one more duty to ask of you before you
go home."

319
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,639
"What would you like me to do, Caesar?"

320
00:28:37,639 --> 00:29:48,519
"Before I die, I will give the people a final gift. An empire at peace should not be ruled by one man. I want to
give power back to the Senate."

321
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,039
Maximus was shocked.

322
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:54,119
"But sir, if no one man holds power, all men will reach for
it"

323
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:59,960
"You're right. That is why I want you to become the Protector of Rome. Give power back to the people of Rome."
Maximus said nothing.

324
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
"You don't want this great honor?"

325
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
"With all my heart, no."

326
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
"That is why it must be you," Marcus replied.

327
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
"But what about Commodus?"

328
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
"Commodus is not a good man. I think you already know that. He must not rule. You are more of a son to me than he is."
Marcus stood up.

329
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
"Commodus will accept my decision-he knows the army is loyal
to you."

330
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
A piece of ice struck Maximus's heart.

331
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
"I need some time sir" he said.

332
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
"Of course. By sunrise tomorrow I hope your answer will be yes. Now let me hold you as a son." Marcus put his arms
around Maximus.

333
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Maximus left the Emperor's tent feeling anxious.

334
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
One more duty, one he did not want-but could he refuse?

335
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
He was a loyal soldier, loyal to Rome and to Caesar.

336
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
He stood outside the tent trying to think clearly.

337
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Suddenly, there was a voice behind him.

338
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
"You are my father's favorite now."

339
00:29:59,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Maximus turned and saw Lucilla.

340
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,000
As their eyes met, a shock of emotion ran through them both.

341
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"It was not always true," said Lucilla.

342
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"Many things have changed since we last met," said Maximus,
and he turned to walk away.

343
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"What did my father want with you?"

344
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
'To wish me luck, before I leave for Spain," he replied,

345
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"You're lying," said Lucilla. "I could always tell when you
were lying.

346
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
You're not very good at it."

347
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"I was never as good as you, my lady."

348
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Lucilla did not try to deny it.

349
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Again, Maximus tried to leave.

350
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"Maximus, please... is it really so terrible to see me
again?"

351
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"No, I'm sorry. I'm tired from battle," he said.

352
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"And you're upset to see my father so weak. Commodus expects our father to name him in a few days as the next Caesar.
Will you be as loyal to him as you have been to Marcus?"

353
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
This was a difficult question, but Maximus never forgot that
he was talking to one of the royal family.

354
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"I will always be loyal to Rome," he said.

355
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"Do you know I still remember you when I speak to the gods?"
said Lucilla, smiling.

356
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"I was sorry to hear of your husband's death, I understand
you have a son."

357
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"Yes," said Lucilla.

358
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"Lucius. He's almost eight years old."

359
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"I, too, have a son who is eight years old."

360
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
They smiled at each other again.

361
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"I thank you for your kind thoughts," said Maximus, and then
he walked slowly back to his tent.

362
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Lucilla watched him go.

363
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Her thoughts were confused, and her emotions reminded her
that she had once loved this man.

364
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Maximus sat in front of a low table in his tent.

365
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
On the table were small wooden figures of his family-parents
and grandparents.

366
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
In the center, protected by the others, were the two
smallest figures.

367
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
These were his wife and child.

368
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
As he looked at his family, he tried to imagine what his
father or grandfather would do in his situation.

369
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
What would they decide?

370
00:30:00,000 --> 00:31:14,400
How would they advise him?

371
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,240
He picked up the figure of his wife and kissed it.

372
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,240
"Cicero," he called out.

373
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,279
Behind him, his servant Cicero appeared and gave him a
drink.

374
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,759
"Do you ever find it difficult to do your duty?" Maximus
asked him.

375
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:33,039
Cicero, a tall, thin man with long hair, thought about the
question for a few seconds.

376
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:36,599
"Sometimes I do what I want to do, sir," he said.

377
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,440
"The rest of the time I do what I have to do."

378
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,799
Maximus smiled.

379
00:31:40,799 --> 00:34:28,279
"We may not be able to go home," he said, sadly.

380
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:35,400
Marcus Aurelius sat in his great tent, lit only by the light of a fire, and prepared himself to tell Commodus of his
decision.

381
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,000
Finally, he said, "You will do your duty for Rome."

382
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:44,920
Commodus stood in front of him, proud and tall, waiting to
hear his father name him as the next Caesar.

383
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,079
"Yes, Father," he said.

384
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,760
"But you will not be Emperor," Marcus said.

385
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,679
Commodus froze as his future suddenly disappeared.

386
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,400
"Who will take my place?" he asked.

387
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:04,199
"My power will pass to Maximus, to hold until the Senate is ready to rule. Rome will be a republic again. I can see that
you are not happy, my son..."

388
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:06,639
"You break my heart," Commodus said.

389
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:19,279
"I have tried to make you proud... but I could never do it. Why do you hate me so much? I only wanted to be your son,
but I was never quite good enough." Marcus put his arms around his son, and Commodus cried.

390
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:24,279
"Why does Maximus deserve this instead of me? Why do you
love him more than me?"

391
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:28,239
His voice grew louder as he held his father's head tighter
and tighter.

392
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:29,760
Marcus could not breathe.

393
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,840
He began to move, trying to get away, but Commodus held his
father's face close against his chest.

394
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,159
His strength was too great; Marcus could not escape.

395
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:43,400
Commodus did not relax until he felt his father's body drop
in his arms.

396
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,480
He placed him on the bed, dead.

397
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,279
"You didn't love me enough," he said softly.

398
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,960
Quintus woke Maximus in the middle of the night.

399
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,920
Maximus realized immediately that there was trouble.

400
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,440
"The Emperor needs you," Quintus said.

401
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,840
"It's urgent."

402
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,159
"What is it?" Maximus asked.

403
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,720
"They did not tell me," said Quintus.

404
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,079
They hurried to Marcus's tent together.

405
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,360
At the entrance, the guards let them through without a word.

406
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,920
Inside, Maximus saw Commodus first.

407
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,559
His face was white but showed no emotion.

408
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,079
Lucilla stood in a corner of the tent, looking down at the
floor.

409
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:19,960
Then Maximus saw Marcus, lying on his bed.

410
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,039
He knew immediately that he was dead.

411
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:24,400
"How did he die?" he asked.

412
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,720
"In his sleep," said Commodus.

413
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,159
"The doctors say there was no pain."

414
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:32,199
Maximus looked at Lucilla, but she turned away.

415
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:36,559
He walked to the bed, bent over Marcus, and kissed the top
of his head.

416
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,800
Then he stood and faced Commodus.

417
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,960
Commodus looked back at him and held out his hand.

418
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,920
"Your Emperor asks for your loyalty," he said.

419
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,800
"Take my hand, Maximus." Maximus understood the situation
exactly.

420
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,599
He knew, without a doubt, that Commodus had killed his
father.

421
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:56,559
"I shall only offer it once," said Commodus.

422
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:59,400
Maximus walked past him and out of the tent.

423
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,279
Quintus already had his orders from the new Caesar.

424
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,480
Commodus looked across at him and he followed his general
out into the night.

425
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:09,199
Lucilla bent over her father and kissed him.

426
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,920
Then she turned to her brother.

427
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,960
Their eyes met.

428
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,239
She hit his face twice, hard.

429
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,079
He stepped back, shocked.

430
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,119
Then she took his right hand, lifted it to her lips, and
kissed it.

431
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,519
"I greet you, Caesar," Lucilla said without emotion.

432
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,679
Back in his own tent, Maximus called to Cicero.

433
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,360
"I must talk to the senators," he said.

434
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,960
"Wake Gaius and Falco! I need their advice."

435
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,159
Quintus arrived just then, and caught the servants arm to
stop him.

436
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,559
"Maximus, please be careful..."

437
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,279
"Careful? The Emperor was murdered!" said Maximus.

438
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:45,119
"No," said Quintus.

439
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,320
"The Emperor died in his sleep."

440
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,519
Maximus looked toward the entrance of the tent and saw four
royal guards with their swords ready.

441
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,840
They came in and quickly tied his hands and arms.

442
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,239
"Please don't fight, Maximus," said Quintus.

443
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,880
"I'm sorry. . . Caesar has spoken."

444
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,320
Maximus understood.

445
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,880
Quintus was a soldier, and his orders had come from the top.

446
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,119
He had to obey.

447
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,079
"Quintus... promise me you'll look after my family" said
Maximus.

448
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,519
"Your family will greet you in the next world," Quintus
said, quietly.

449
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,679
Maximus jumped at him in anger.

450
00:38:18,679 --> 00:39:59,960
One of the guards hit the prisoner on the back of the head
with the handle of his sword and Maximus fell to the ground.

451
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
"Take him as far as the sunrise and then kill him," said
Quintus.

452
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
It was nearly sunrise, and the five horses on the forest
road had not passed anybody for several hours.

453
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Here there was nothing- no help, no hope.

454
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
"All right, this is far enough," said Cornelius, the oldest
of the guards and their leader.

455
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
"Take him down there. No one will ever find him."

456
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Two of the guards climbed from their horses and pulled
Maximus from his horse.

457
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
His hands were still tied in front of him.

458
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Cornelius searched in his bag for something to eat.

459
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
He would make sure the orders from Caesar were obeyed but he
did not want to have Roman blood on his hands.

460
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
The other man, Salvius, stayed with the three horses.

461
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
The two guards led Maximus down the hill.

462
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
They thought he had given up the fight, but he was like a
cat watching a mouse.

463
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
He could see they were young and their armor was still new.

464
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
These were royal guards-they almost never left Rome and they
did not usually go into battle.

465
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
They were not experienced fighters.

466
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
"This is good enough," said one of them.

467
00:39:59,960 --> 00:39:59,960
"On your knees."

468
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,000
Behind Maximus, one of the guards was ready with his sword
to cut off his head.

469
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
The second guard stood facing Maximus.

470
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Maximus sunk to his knees and closed his eyes.

471
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
As the sword came down, he turned very quickly and caught it
between his hands.

472
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Then he brought the handle of the sword up into the guards
face.

473
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
In the next second he turned again and struck the sword
through the other guard.

474
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,039
As he got to his feet and turned back to the first man, he
saw his chance and pushed the sword through his body.

475
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,000
On the road above, Cornelius and Salvius were waiting on
their horses.

476
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:07,400
They heard a cry from below, and then it was quiet again.

477
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,119
Cornelius sent Salvius down to make certain Maximus was
dead.

478
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,440
The guard rode down the hill but saw nothing of his friends.

479
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,559
Suddenly, he felt there was someone behind him.

480
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:23,079
He turned in time to see Maximus's sword as it flew through
the air toward him and landed in his chest.

481
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,400
He fell to his death.

482
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,039
Cornelius was still on his horse, eating his bread and meat.

483
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,920
He heard some noises below, moved across the road, and
looked down into the trees.

484
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,519
With no sound at all Maximus came onto the road behind him.

485
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:38,440
"Guard!" he shouted.

486
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,199
Cornelius turned around and rode toward Maximus at full
speed, his sword ready.

487
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,679
As they met, Maximus struck his sword upward and back.

488
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:48,880
It cut right through Cornelius's body.

489
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,960
Cornelius fell off his horse and lay down to die.

490
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:14,599
But Maximus had also been wounded, with a deep cut to his
shoulder from Cornelius's sword.

491
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:17,559
He fought the pain and moved toward the horses.

492
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,719
CHAPTER FOUR

493
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:19,920
A Prisoner Again

494
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,719
Maximus rode fast through the German forests on Cornelius's
horse.

495
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:26,559
He was leading one of the other horses behind him.

496
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:31,960
He had put a cloth around the cut in his shoulder, but it
was bad and gave him a lot of pain.

497
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,960
Blood ran down his arm as he rode, but he did not have time
to stop.

498
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,119
By the middle of the day he had crossed into the east of
France.

499
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:43,519
He rode his horse as hard as he could-he had to get home
before it was too late.

500
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:48,239
Into the night he continued riding, not stopping for water,
food, or rest.

501
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,000
He saw nothing as he passed through the country and he
remembered nothing.

502
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:55,199
He could only think that time was passing so quickly.

503
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,679
He became hot and tired and decided to throw off his armor.

504
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:02,639
His horse was also tired, and he knew it could not go much
further.

505
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:08,719
He changed horses and continued his urgent flight toward
Spain and the faraway hills above Trujillo.

506
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:13,960
In the light of early day, the Spanish hills around the farm
and house were unbelievably beautiful.

507
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,239
An eight-year-old boy with dark hair was in a field beside
the pink stone house.

508
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,000
He was training a wild horse, making it walk around the
field.

509
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,599
A beautiful, black-haired woman watched her son working with
the horse and smiled.

510
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:30,119
He would have a fine riding horse by the time his father
returned.

511
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,159
The boy stopped-he saw something.

512
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:36,000
Over a hill he could just see a battle flag, coming in their
direction.

513
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:39,719
He shouted with excitement and happiness and ran out of the
field.

514
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,920
He ran toward the flag, calling, "Father! Father!"

515
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,679
The woman, too, looked toward the flag.

516
00:42:46,679 --> 00:45:44,679
But there was something about it that worried her.

517
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,000
Something was not right, and she suddenly felt anxious.

518
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,279
The boy continued to run along the road.

519
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,400
Soon soldiers appeared over the hill.

520
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,559
But they were not the Roman soldiers he expected to see.

521
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:58,519
He slowed down, then stopped, confused.

522
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,119
Twenty royal guards were riding down the road, and his
father was not among them.

523
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,960
He searched their faces again, looking for his father,
hoping.

524
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,159
Behind him his mother started shouting out his name.

525
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:15,920
The horses suddenly came faster, riding over the small boy
and crashing him into the dirt of the road.

526
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,800
Then they rode straight toward his screaming mother.

527
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,559
At the hills turned pink and gold with the sunset, a rider
raced for his life killing the horse under him.

528
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:26,519
His shoulder was bleeding badly.

529
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,679
He came to the top of a long, low hill and stopped.

530
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:35,079
There was a line of thick, black smoke in the distance and
he tried to see where it was coming from.

531
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:39,760
With a cry of pain he forced the horse forward, racing down
the far side of the hill.

532
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,239
Would he arrive in time?

533
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:44,880
Maximus's worst dream did not equal the sight in front of
him.

534
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,679
His family home and farm were burning, completely destroyed.

535
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,720
The wheat and the apple trees were burnt black, and smoke
still curved upward from the last stones of his house.

536
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,880
Two pink stone chimneys were left standing-nothing else.

537
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,880
He stopped the horse violently.

538
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,239
It fell over onto its side and Maximus was thrown off.

539
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,199
His stomach was sick with fear.

540
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:07,079
He knew now what he would find.

541
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,199
He stopped before the field of vegetables, looked up, and
forced himself to breathe.

542
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:16,279
There, hanging on ropes, were the burnt bodies of his wife
and son.

543
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:18,480
There was almost nothing left of them.

544
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,760
He reached up with both hands to touch his wife's feet.

545
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,239
A terrible scream came from him, and he sank to the earth.

546
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:26,800
His world was now dead.

547
00:47:26,800 --> 00:48:16,840
Maximus dug one deep hole in the black earth on the hillside
for his wife and son.

548
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,679
He pushed the earth back over their broken, burnt bodies and
cried.

549
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:25,159
He looked down toward the ruin of the house he had built, to
the dead apple trees.

550
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:27,800
He spoke to his loved ones through his tears.

551
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,960
"Lie in the shadow of the trees, my loves, and wait for me
there..."

552
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,039
He fell onto the earth beside them.

553
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:37,079
They came because they had smelled the smoke in the air.

554
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,239
Fire meant there was something to be found and taken.

555
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:44,559
These were Spanish thieves, and their chief was a big
mountain man with a black beard.

556
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,039
They found the man lying dead on the black earth.

557
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:50,320
Hands touched his shoes-expensive, leather shoes.

558
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,360
Other hands moved over his soldiers clothes-fine, dark red
cloth.

559
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,360
Suddenly, the dead man moved.

560
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,279
The hands on his body stopped.

561
00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:00,720
Something was said in a strange language.

562
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,960
Everyone waited.

563
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,440
The big man on the ground did not move again.

564
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:10,000
The chief made a sign to his men, and the hands roughly took
hold of Maximus and pulled him away.

565
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,599
Days and nights passed, and for Maximus it was like a never-
ending feverish dream.

566
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:20,079
Terrible pictures crossed his mind as he lay close to death
in the open carriage they had thrown him into.

567
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:25,760
He dreamed of wild animals, close to his face... then he was
on a ship, traveling across water.

568
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:33,320
A large African man smiled down at him ... he saw views of the desert... far-away mountains... heard shouts in a
strange language.

569
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,360
It was hot, too hot to breathe...

570
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,440
Maximus's eyes opened slowly.

571
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:44,360
Centimeters away from his face was a wild tiger-and this one did not go away when he closed his eyes and opened them
again.

572
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:49,760
He looked around and realized that he was one of several men
chained together in a dirty slave carriage.

573
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,440
There were small windows at the front and back and on both
sides.

574
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,559
He looked through one of the windows and saw other carriages
traveling with them.

575
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,960
Wild animals in chains were walking along with them, some
close to the window that he was looking through.

576
00:49:59,960 --> 00:49:59,960
He fell back onto the floor, thinking, "This must all be a
terrible dream."

577
00:49:59,960 --> 00:49:59,960
When Maximus woke again, he saw twelve slaves, all chained
together, all looking at him.

578
00:49:59,960 --> 00:49:59,960
Outside the carriage he could hear men talking in a language
he did not understand.

579
00:49:59,960 --> 00:49:59,960
Someone was looking down at him, a big African man.

580
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,000
"Juba," said the African, giving his name.

581
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
He, too, was chained.

582
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Maximus moved with great pain and saw that the sword wound
on his shoulder was worse than he had realized.

583
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Juba was putting something on the wound.

584
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Maximus fell back again and slept.

585
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
When he woke again, the African was still with him.

586
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
"You see?" he said.

587
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
"Now your arm is getting better-it's clean." He put his
finger gently on the wound.

588
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
"Don't die," said Juba.

589
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
"They'll feed you to the tigers. They're more expensive than
we are."

590
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Maximus stared at him, and Juba looked down with a small
smile on his lips.

591
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The desert heat of Morocco was not like anything that
Maximus had known.

592
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The hot air made breathing difficult.

593
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
He did not care about breathing, though.

594
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Maximus did not care about anything.

595
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
All around him men were standing in the sand in a slave
market.

596
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The buyers walked slowly around, looking at the men and
touching them.

597
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
There was a man with a black beard standing near them,
calling out to tell people about his slaves.

598
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Maximus stood with the others, looking far away, beyond the
people and the market.

599
00:50:00,000 --> 00:51:24,320
Physically, he was getting better with Juba's help.

600
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,159
But nobody could help the darkness inside him.

601
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:29,639
He did not even care about his own life.

602
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:31,000
Maximus the Roman

603
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,480
General, Maximus the farmer and husband was already dead.

604
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,440
Across the market square Aelius Proximo sat in a small,
dirty cafe and watched everything with interest.

605
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,760
Proximo was a large man with big, blue eyes and white hair
and beard.

606
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,039
He looked like a man who enjoyed the good things in life.

607
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,960
He drank his tea slowly, as a man measured his feet for new
shoes.

608
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,159
Two slave girls sat beside him.

609
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:58,039
"Proximo, my friend!" said the man with the black beard.

610
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:01,440
Proximo recognized the man immediately and turned away.

611
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:05,199
"Every day you are here is a great day," the man said,
smiling.

612
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:07,199
He came to sit with Proximo.

613
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:09,000
"And today is your lucky day"

614
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,199
Proximo caught hold of his arm and held it tight.

615
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:20,000
"It wasn't my lucky day the last time you sold me some animals. They're no good-they only run around and eat. Give
me my money back!"

616
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:22,599
The slave-seller tried to pull his arm away.

617
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:28,800
"I'll give you a special price today-because you are
unhappy. Just for you. Come and see the new tigers."

618
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,239
Proximo let him go and followed him across the square.

619
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,639
"Look at this one," said the man.

620
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:36,280
"Isn't he a beauty?"

621
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,960
Proximo looked at the tigers through the bars.

622
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,159
"Do they fight?" he asked.

623
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:45,800
"Of course! For you, my special price, only eight thousand."

624
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,880
"For me," said Proximo, "four thousand. That's my special
price."

625
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,880
"Four? I have to eat..."

626
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,880
Proximo looked around at the group of men in chains.

627
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,280
"Do any of them fight?" he said.

628
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,159
"There's a contest soon."

629
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,239
"Some are good for fighting, some for dying. You need both."

630
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:06,239
Proximo walked over to Juba.

631
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,000
"Get up," he commanded the big African.

632
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:11,559
Juba lifted his head and looked at him.

633
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:12,840
He got up slowly.

634
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,039
Proximo looked at him carefully.

635
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:18,440
He turned over Juba's hands and felt the hard skin.

636
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,360
Then he moved on to Maximus.

637
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:30,760
He saw the wound on his arm and then he saw the mark just above it-the letters "SPQR." Proximo knew that they meant
Senatus Populusque Romanus: The Senate and the Roman People.

638
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,880
"A soldier," said Proximo.

639
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,639
"Did you run away?" he asked Maximus.

640
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:37,400
But Maximus said nothing.

641
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,719
"Probably," said the slave-seller.

642
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:41,599
"They say he's a Spaniard."

643
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:44,239
Proximo walked on and looked at the others.

644
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,679
"I'll take six-a thousand for all of them," he said.

645
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:50,960
His servant handed him a small brush with red paint on it.

646
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,679
"A thousand!" the slave-seller cried.

647
00:53:53,679 --> 00:54:00,719
"The African alone should cost two thousand." He whispered
to Proximo, "Turn your back on him, he'll kill you."

648
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,719
"These slaves are no good," said Proximo, as he walked away.

649
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:07,840
"Wait, wait... we can discuss the price."

650
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,079
Proximo made a mark in red paint on the chests of the slaves
he had chosen.

651
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:18,960
"I'll give you two thousand," he said, "and four for the
animals. But it will be five thousand for an old friend."

652
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,119
The slave-seller thought for a second and then accepted.

653
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:25,279
"But those tigers have to fight," said Proximo.

654
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:31,000
"Don't feed them for a day and a half," said the
slave-seller, "and they'll eat their own mothers."

655
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,720
"Interesting idea," said Proximo, as he walked away.

656
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,440
His servants pulled the chains tied to Juba, Maximus, and
the others, and they were led away.

657
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,159
Proximo's carriages arrived in a crowded, Moroccan port
city.

658
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,679
Maximus and Juba sat together with twelve other new slaves.

659
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:50,440
One was a small, very frightened Greek man.

660
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,679
He was probably a teacher or a writer.

661
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:54,519
He was definitely not a fighter.

662
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,639
The carriage of slaves was followed by several others
carrying wild animals-including the tigers.

663
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:05,360
Most of the chained men looked back at the tigers from time
to time, not with interest but with fear.

664
00:55:05,360 --> 00:57:53,199
They knew what a hungry tiger could do, and they guessed why
they and the animals had been bought together.

665
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:55,360
They drove through some large iron gates.

666
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:01,679
There was no sign on the gates or on the buildings inside,
but everyone in the city knew the place as Proximo's School.

667
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:05,199
It was not a place to learn Latin, Greek, or mathematics.

668
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:09,559
It was a school where men learned how to fight-to live one
more day in the face of death.

669
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,199
It was a gladiator school.

670
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:13,920
Proximo's school was like a castle prison.

671
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,599
In the center was a square.

672
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:20,840
On one side were the cages for the animals, and on the
opposite side the human prisoners were kept.

673
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:38,000
Maximus and the other new slaves were pushed into their
prison, and the doors crashed shut behind them.

674
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,840
Maximus noticed the guards.

675
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,800
They all carried short swords and some also had arrows or
spears.

676
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,320
At the far end of the square a group of about ten men were
training.

677
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,800
"Battle practice," thought Maximus.

678
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,360
"Like Commodus."

679
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:55,199
A very big man was teaching two new gladiators how to throw
a spear.

680
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:59,119
They were trying to hit a picture of a man, but they were
not very good.

681
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,800
Both students missed it.

682
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,159
The teacher threw his spear and hit the picture in the
stomach.

683
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:07,760
"Haken," said a voice from behind, naming the teacher.

684
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,960
Maximus turned to see Proximo, who was admiring Haken's
strength.

685
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,119
He and Maximus stared at each other.

686
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,320
"Spaniard..." Proximo said, naming Maximus.

687
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,599
Then he moved along the line, naming each new slave.

688
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,360
"Thief... murderer..."

689
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,760
Suddenly, he stopped and smiled.

690
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,679
"Proximo!" he said.

691
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,840
"Anyone know the meaning of that?"

692
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,639
'Nearest.'

693
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:30,400
'Dearest.'

694
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,400
'Close to.'

695
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,599
'I am Proximo.

696
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:36,039
I shall be closer to you in the next days than your own
mothers were.

697
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:40,920
I did not pay good money to buy you," Proximo said. "I paid
to buy your death.

698
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,199
You may die alone, in pairs, or in groups-who knows?

699
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:46,840
Many different ways with just one ending."

700
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,159
He walked around his new slaves, enjoying himself.

701
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,840
"And when you die-and you will die-the sound of cheering
will send you to the next world."

702
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:59,960
Proximo raised his hands and stretched them out to the group
of slaves.

703
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960
"Gladiators, I salute you," he said.

704
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960
CHAPTER FIVE

705
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960
New Gladiators

706
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960
Proximo never missed training for the new boys.

707
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960
He could learn so much about them.

708
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960
The more experienced gladiators trained against each other,
working with swords and spears and with shields and armor.

709
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960
The new ones were put together into a small arena in the
center.

710
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960
One by one they were given heavy wooden swords and sent in
to face the teacher.

711
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960
He had a similar sword.

712
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960
Proximo watched from a short distance.

713
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960
Very quickly his trained eye could sort the new class into
two groups.

714
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960
The fighters were marked with red paint, and the others with
yellow.

715
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:00,000
Haken enjoyed his job as gladiator teacher.

716
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
He took great pleasure in knocking away the swords of his new students and then hitting them hard so they fell onto
the dirt.

717
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It was soon Maximus's turn to face Haken.

718
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
"Spaniard," Haken called to him.

719
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Maximus went forward slowly.

720
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Proximo watched more closely, to see what would happen.

721
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Maximus picked up the sword and stood facing Haken.

722
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Suddenly everyone, especially Haken, saw that this man was a
fighter.

723
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
There was something about the way he held the sword, the way
he stood-but most of all there were his eyes.

724
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
There was no doubt-he knew how to fight.

725
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Maximus lifted the sword and then dropped it to the ground.

726
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
He seemed to be saying, "I could kill, but I choose not to."

727
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Haken was surprised.

728
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Was this an insult?

729
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
He looked to Proximo for orders.

730
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Proximo made a sign to him to continue.

731
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Haken struck Maximus across the stomach.

732
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Maximus fell forward but then stood straight again and faced
him.

733
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Haken looked again to Proximo, and again he was told to
continue.

734
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
This time Haken struck Maximus across his wounded arm.

735
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Maximus almost fell to the ground but managed to stay on his
feet.

736
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
All the time he stared straight at Haken, who was becoming
very angry.

737
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Maximus's thoughts were clear: "I may be low, but I'm not as
low as you. I won't kill for sport."

738
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Proximo found it very interesting.

739
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Haken lifted the sword again, ready to hurt Maximus really
badly, but Proximo stopped him.

740
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
"That's enough for now" he said.

741
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
"His time will come." He looked behind him to the servant
with the pots of paint.

742
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
"Mark that one," he said.

743
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
In the heat of the late afternoon Haken, Juba, the Greek,
and the other new gladiators sat on the ground in the
shadows.

744
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Maximus lay by the wall to one side.

745
01:00:00,000 --> 01:03:50,800
He had a small, sharp stone and was using it to try to
remove the letters SPQR from his arm.

746
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:56,360
Juba called out to him, "Spaniard! Why didn't you fight? We
all have to fight."

747
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,960
Maximus did not answer.

748
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,000
The young Greek was very frightened.

749
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:02,000
"I don't fight," he said.

750
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,480
"I shouldn't be here. I'm a secretary-I can write in seven
languages."

751
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,239
"Good," said Haken.

752
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:11,119
"Tomorrow you can scream in seven languages."

753
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:12,800
The other gladiators laughed.

754
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:17,360
Juba moved closer to Maximus and watched him digging the
stone into his skin.

755
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,159
"Is that the sign of your gods?" he asked.

756
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:21,720
Maximus did not answer.

757
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,440
Behind them Haken was making fun of the Greek.

758
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,760
"Maybe the secretary will be the one who wins his freedom,"
he laughed.

759
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,079
"Freedom!" the Greek replied.

760
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:32,920
"What do I have to do?"

761
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,480
"You go into the arena and you kill me," Haken replied.

762
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:43,599
"Then you kill him, and the African, and him, and a hundred
more. And when there are no more men to fight, you're free."

763
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,119
"I can't do that," cried the Greek.

764
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:54,320
"No," said Haken, suddenly serious, "but I can." He looked from one gladiator to the next until his eyes rested on
Maximus.

765
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,559
Maximus stared back at him, his face like stone.

766
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:02,159
Proximo and his gladiators walked through the streets of the
town on their way to the arena.

767
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:07,039
Haken and the gladiators were chained together, and
Proximo's guards walked with them.

768
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:09,119
They were all carrying short swords.

769
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,480
The arena was small.

770
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:16,159
It was not like the enormous Colosseum in Rome, although it
was there for the same reason-to entertain the people.

771
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:20,199
This arena was just a circle of sandy ground with a lot of
seats around it.

772
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:24,559
But the seats were filled with people, and the people were
expecting to see blood.

773
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:28,880
Maximus and the other gladiators were taken to a small area
behind the seats.

774
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,760
Above them were Proximo's seats, next to the seats of
several other gladiator trainers.

775
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:40,039
This special position gave the trainers a good view of the arena and they could also see the gladiators preparing to
fight.

776
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:45,239
They discussed their gladiators together before the contest
started-who would live and who would die.

777
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:49,239
"Has the African fought before?" one of the men asked
Proximo.

778
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:51,199
"No, first time."

779
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:54,720
"And that one?" he asked, pointing to Maximus.

780
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,000
"Soldier?"

781
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,920
"Him? He's no good," said Proximo.

782
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,639
"But I have an idea."

783
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:02,519
He called down to his guards.

784
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:05,599
"Chain the Spaniard to the African." he said.

785
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,039
The other man was not sure about Maximus.

786
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,000
He liked the look of the Spaniard.

787
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,960
"I think he'll live through this fight, you think he'll
die," he said.

788
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,679
"Let's put money on the result-a thousand?"

789
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:20,559
"Against my own man? I don't do that," said Proximo.

790
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,079
"And if I make it five thousand?"

791
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:24,800
Proximo thought about it.

792
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,239
That was a lot of money.

793
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:29,880
Proximo liked to see his new boys before they went to fight.

794
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,400
A guard called for silence as he walked into the waiting
area.

795
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:43,279
"Some of you are thinking that you won't fight," Proximo said, "and some that you can't fight. They all say that
until they're out there." He pulled a sword down from a shelf.

796
01:06:43,279 --> 01:06:51,679
"Push this into another man and the crowd will cheer and love you. You may even begin to love them back." He stuck
the point of the sword in a table.

797
01:06:51,679 --> 01:07:05,159
"In the end, we are all dead men. Sadly, we cannot choose how. But we can decide how we accept that end, so we are
remembered as men. You go out into the arena as slaves. You come back-if you come back-as gladiators."

798
01:07:05,159 --> 01:08:24,720
Outside, the crowd was getting impatient.

799
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:29,960
Before he left, Proximo walked down the line of men, saying
who must be chained together.

800
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:35,880
They were all put in teams of two-and it soon became clear
that the method was to chain a "Red to a "Yellow."

801
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,279
Each good fighter was with a certain loser.

802
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,239
Haken was chained to the crying Greek secretary.

803
01:08:41,239 --> 01:08:45,880
Maximus- a "loser" because he had refused to fight Haken-was
chained to Juba.

804
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,479
Maximus turned to look at the closed door.

805
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:51,520
From the other side they could hear the shouts of the crowd.

806
01:08:51,559 --> 01:08:57,840
Suddenly, Maximus bent down and picked up a little sand from
the ground, then let it fall through his fingers.

807
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,399
Juba watched him but did not understand.

808
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:03,359
When Maximus stood up again, he looked different.

809
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:04,880
He was ready for battle.

810
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:59,960
Outside, the crowds were cheering and shouting.

811
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
There was the sound of drums.

812
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
Everyone stood anxiously waiting.

813
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
Suddenly, the doors to the arena crashed open and sunlight
poured in.

814
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
For a few seconds the men were blinded by it.

815
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
There were trained gladiators already in the arena, waiting,
their swords and spears ready for killing.

816
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
The new gladiators ran out, some to immediate death.

817
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
Side by side, their chain loose between them, Maximus and
Juba ran out into the arena.

818
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
It was not a fair fight.

819
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
The new men had only one small sword and no armor; the
experienced gladiators had much better equipment.

820
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
Maximus and Juba fought together.

821
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
Juba was surprised to see that his partner-marked with the
yellow of cowards-was fighting bravely.

822
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
All the anger and pain inside Maximus had come out, and he
was better than any man in the arena.

823
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
He knew this was not his day to die, not like this.

824
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
Together they killed the first pair of gladiators.

825
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
Others came to fight them and, for a second, Juba lost his
sword as he attacked.

826
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
Maximus pulled him clear of the other man's sword and then
struck the attacker hard.

827
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
His sword point came out the man's back.

828
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
He and Juba worked together as a team.

829
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
They were strong and fast, and many of the attacking
gladiators were killed by them.

830
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
Haken fought with great power.

831
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
The Greek was soon killed, and Haken cut off the man's hand
so it was easier for him to move about in the arena.

832
01:09:59,960 --> 01:09:59,960
Proximo watched everything closely.

833
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:00,000
The crowd quickly realized that Juba and Maximus were a
strong fighting pair and began to cheer them.

834
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Soon all the attackers were on the ground.

835
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Juba and Maximus looked around, and then at each other.

836
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
But then, as they began to relax, one of the gladiators
tried to get to his feet.

837
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
They ran forward together and pulled their chain tightly
around his neck.

838
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
The fighting had ended.

839
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
The crowd were on their feet, cheering.

840
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Maximus looked at the many bodies around him, and then at
the excited faces of the crowd.

841
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It made him sick that people were entertained by the sight
of men killing other men.

842
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
He walked toward the entrance and threw his sword into the
crowd.

843
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It only made them cheer louder.

844
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Proximo was pleased with the day's work.

845
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
He had lost a lot of money but he had found a new fighter.

846
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
CHAPTER SIX

847
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Caesar's Arrival in Rome

848
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It was a special day in Rome, a holiday.

849
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Fifty black-armored royal guards marched down the main
street of Rome, followed by hundreds of men on horses.

850
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Behind them came the royal carriage.

851
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Commodus, the new Emperor of Rome, was coming home.

852
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
His sister Lucilla was sitting next to him.

853
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Another fifty guards marched behind them.

854
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Close to the royal carriage, on a beautiful black horse,
rode Quintus, the new Commander of the Royal Guards.

855
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Commodus had told the Senate that he was now the Commander
of the Roman Army, and that the army was loyal to him.

856
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Many senators doubted it, but there was no one in Rome with
enough power to take control.

857
01:10:00,000 --> 01:13:11,840
And so nothing could stop Commodus.

858
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,720
The people had been told that their new Emperor would arrive
in Rome on this date, at this time.

859
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:21,800
The city was cleaned up and purple flags were hung outside
the most important buildings.

860
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,720
The citizens of Rome lined the streets at the time he was
expected.

861
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:35,439
The crowd was not very big and it was not very enthusiastic.

862
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:37,399
They cheered, but not loudly.

863
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:41,800
Commodus was young and had no experience, but the people
could forgive that.

864
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,640
They were more worried about the stories they had heard-that
Commodus was selfish and cruel.

865
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,079
He was not his father, and they had loved Marcus Aurelius.

866
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:55,000
Commodus had much work to do to make himself popular and win
the support of the people.

867
01:13:55,039 --> 01:14:01,800
Ahead, on the steps of the Senate, a group of senators stood
waiting: Falco, Gaius, and Gracchus were among them.

868
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,600
Lucius, Lucilla's eight-year-old son, was standing with
them.

869
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,600
Senator Gracchus, a white-haired man in his sixties, was not
happy about the new Emperor.

870
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,760
"He is entering Rome like a hero-but what has he ever done?"
he said.

871
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,760
"Give him time, Gracchus," Falco answered.

872
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,000
"He's young. I think he could do very well."

873
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,239
"For Rome?" asked Gracchus.

874
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:24,560
"Or for you?"

875
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,279
Falco turned to Lucius.

876
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:30,520
"It's a proud day for all of us, isn't it, Lucius?" he said.

877
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,479
"I'm sure Senator Gracchus never thought he'd live to see
such a day."

878
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:39,439
Lucius watched as the royal carriage came closer, then ran
down the steps when it arrived.

879
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:43,920
He jumped up into his mother's arms and she held him tight
and kissed him.

880
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:50,560
Commodus raised his arm in salute to the crowd, but he could see that the crowd was small and the cheering was only
polite.

881
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,439
"Rome greets her new Emperor," Falco said.

882
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:56,520
"Your loyal people are here to welcome you, sir."

883
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:05,000
"Thank you, Falco," replied Commodus, "for bringing out the loyal people. I hope they weren't too expensive." He turned
to Gracchus.

884
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,079
"Ah, Gracchus," he said.

885
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:08,720
"The friend of Rome."

886
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:12,000
"We are happy that you are home, Caesar," Gracchus said.

887
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,800
Then he became more serious.

888
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,760
"There are many problems that need your attention."

889
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,720
In the royal palace Commodus was meeting with the senators.

890
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,680
He was following his sister's advice and listening to them
patiently.

891
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,520
Senator Gracchus had a list of problems in the city.

892
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:34,640
He was anxious that Commodus look at them without delay. "... and here are some suggestions from the Senate-ideas for
solving the problems," he said.

893
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,640
Commodus walked around the room, losing interest.

894
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,279
Lucilla listened carefully-and watched her brother.

895
01:15:40,279 --> 01:15:43,000
Finally, Commodus could not listen any longer.

896
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:47,159
"You see Gracchus, this is exactly the problem," he
interrupted.

897
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:52,159
"My father spent too much time listening to the Senate, and
the people were forgotten."

898
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:55,359
"The Senate is the people, Caesar," said Gracchus.

899
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:58,840
"Chosen from among the people, to speak for the people."

900
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:08,199
"I doubt many of the people eat as well as you do, Gracchus. Or have the beautiful home you have, Gaius. I think I
understand my own people." Commodus said.

901
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:13,359
"Would Caesar kindly teach us, from his own great
experience?" replied Gracchus.

902
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:19,079
"I call it love, Gracchus. I am their father. The people are
my children," said Commodus.

903
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:20,479
He was getting angry.

904
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:22,159
Lucilla stepped forward.

905
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:25,399
"Senators, my brother is very tired," she said.

906
01:16:25,399 --> 01:16:31,960
"Please leave your list with me. Caesar will do everything
that Rome needs." She called for a slave to show them out.

907
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,600
The senators left, but they were not pleased.

908
01:16:34,600 --> 01:17:45,399
It was not a good start for the new Emperor.

909
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:48,239
When they had gone, Lucilla turned to Commodus.

910
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,760
"The Senate can be useful," she said.

911
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,600
"How?" he replied.

912
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,840
"They only talk" He moved to a window and looked out over
the great city.

913
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,000
"It should be just you, and me, and Rome."

914
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,920
"There has always been a Senate..." said Lucilla.

915
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,279
"Rome has changed," he answered.

916
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:07,840
"It takes an emperor to rule an empire."

917
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,079
"Of course, but leave the people their traditions."

918
01:18:11,079 --> 01:18:16,960
It had been a "tradition" for the last two hundred years to
believe that the Senate ruled Rome, through the Emperor.

919
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,319
But everyone knew the real situation.

920
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:24,399
The army held the political power in Rome, and the real
ruler was whoever the army was loyal to.

921
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,600
Commodus's thoughts were moving ahead.

922
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:37,840
"All the years of my father's wars gave the people nothing-but still they loved him. Why? They didn't see the
battles. They knew nothing of the people we fought and killed, or their countries," he said.

923
01:18:37,880 --> 01:19:59,960
"They care about the greatness of Rome," said Lucilla.

924
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"And what is that? Can I touch it, see it?"

925
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"It's an idea. It's something they want to believe in," said
Lucilla.

926
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
Commodus was suddenly excited.

927
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"I'll give them something to believe in-I'll give them great ideas. And they'll love me for it," he said, raising his
arms to the sky.

928
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"I will give them the greatest ideas, the most wonderful
Rome ever!"

929
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
There were artists at work in the streets, painting enormous
pictures on walls.

930
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
Their pictures showed scenes of gladiators and wild animals fighting, and the sand on the floors of the arenas was red
with blood.

931
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
Crowds stood and stared, watching as the pictures were
completed.

932
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
This was the start of the advertising for Commodus's new
idea.

933
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"Games!" Gaius complained to Gracchus and a group of other
senators as he joined them in a cafe.

934
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"One hundred and fifty days of games!"

935
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
The senators watched the wall painters working outside the
cafe.

936
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"He's smarter than I thought," said Gracchus, quietly.

937
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"Smart?" said Gaius.

938
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"All of Rome would laugh at him if they weren't so afraid of his guards. You can't really think that the people will
forget Rome's problems and sit back to enjoy these games?" he asked.

939
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"It's completely mad."

940
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"I think he knows what Rome is," Gracchus replied.

941
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"He will give them magic, and then they'll have something else to think about. He will take their lives, and he will
take their freedom. And still they will shout and cheer." He shook his head, sadly.

942
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
"The beating heart of Rome isn't in the walls of the Senate. It's on the sand of the Colosseum. He will give them death.
And they will love him for it."

943
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
The other senators knew he was right.

944
01:19:59,960 --> 01:19:59,960
It was a lesson from history.

945
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:00,000
But they did not know that Commodus was planning better and
longer games than any emperor before him.

946
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And it was all for one reason.

947
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Commodus knew he had no choice.

948
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
He and the Senate did not agree about anything and he could
not be certain of their support.

949
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
So he had to look beyond the Senate and go straight to the
people for his power.

950
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
The games were the key.

951
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
As Lucilla had said, the people must have their traditions.

952
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And he would not deny his citizens their traditional games.

953
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Sitting behind the senators in the cafe, with his back to
them, was a small man.

954
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
None of the senators noticed him, but he was close enough to
hear everything they said.

955
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
The face of the listener was quite ordinary, except that his
right eye was missing.

956
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
He did not see well with only one eye, but he could hear
perfectly and he had a good memory.

957
01:20:00,000 --> 01:22:20,520
He was able to collect a lot of information and he was paid
well to repeat it to other ears.

958
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,800
CHAPTER SEVEN

959
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,560
The Spaniard and the Crowd

960
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:28,399
Crowds of people came down the hillside from their small
houses above the Moroccan town.

961
01:22:28,439 --> 01:22:33,800
They were all going toward the arena, hoping to put a little
excitement into their difficult lives.

962
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,760
Maximus's arm, now without the letters SPQR, was covered
with an arm guard.

963
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,760
He had earned the extra protection of armor because of his
brave fighting.

964
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:50,520
He bent and picked up some dirt from the ground, watched it disappear through his fingers, and walked quickly toward the
entrance to the arena.

965
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,279
Proximo walked with him.

966
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:56,680
"You just kill, kill, kill!" Proximo shouted at Maximus.

967
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:10,079
"You make it look too easy. The crowd wants a hero, not just someone cutting up meat. We want them to keep coming back.
Don't kill so quickly-take more time!" The cheers of the crowd grew louder as they got closer to the arena.

968
01:23:10,119 --> 01:23:14,359
"Give them an adventure to remember!" Proximo shouted above
the noise.

969
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:22,079
"Fall to one knee-they'll think you're finished. Then force yourself to your feet-our hero!" He was rushing along to
keep up with Maximus.

970
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:24,359
"Remember, you're an entertainer!"

971
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:28,159
Without a word to Proximo, Maximus walked out into the
arena.

972
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:29,760
There was a cheer immediately.

973
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:34,479
He was a known fighter now, and the Moroccans knew they were
going to see some real action.

974
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:37,479
Out in the bright sunlight, six fighters waited.

975
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:41,560
Maximus looked at them and decided immediately on his method
of attack.

976
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:44,960
He chose the strongest and most confident man first.

977
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,560
When that man went down, the others would know they had no
chance.

978
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:53,600
He cut them down, one by one, his sword striking through
their bodies with great speed.

979
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,720
It was all finished in a few minutes.

980
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,600
The crowd stood and cheered.

981
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,560
They shouted, "Spaniard! Spaniard!"

982
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,479
Proximo got up from his seat and walked out.

983
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:09,119
Maximus dropped his arm to his side, stepped over a body,
and walked back toward the exit.

984
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:12,640
He picked up a sword from the sand and threw it into the
crowd.

985
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:17,199
As it fell to the floor, the screaming crowd grew silent,
watching and waiting.

986
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:20,560
"Are you not entertained?" Maximus shouted at them.

987
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:27,319
"Is this not why you came?" He threw down his own sword and
walked out of the arena gates and back to the prison area.

988
01:24:27,319 --> 01:24:32,319
In the cool of the evening, Maximus and Juba stood inside
the gates of Proximo's school.

989
01:24:32,319 --> 01:24:35,560
They looked out over the desert to the mountains in the
distance.

990
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:38,640
"My country-it's somewhere out there," Juba said.

991
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:46,560
"My home. My wife is preparing food and my daughters are carrying water from the river. Will I ever see them again? I
think not."

992
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,560
"Do you believe you'll meet them again-after you die?"
Maximus asked.

993
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,640
"I think so," Juba said.

994
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:56,319
"But I will die soon. They will not die for many years."

995
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:58,359
"But you would wait for them."

996
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:00,199
"Of course," Juba said.

997
01:25:00,199 --> 01:25:03,560
"I almost died, coming here," said Maximus.

998
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:09,159
"You saved me. I never thanked you" Maximus looked at Juba,
and there was pain in his eyes.

999
01:25:09,159 --> 01:25:12,640
"Because my wife, and my son, are waiting for me."

1000
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:13,880
Juba understood.

1001
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:16,119
"You'll meet them again," he said.

1002
01:25:16,119 --> 01:25:18,680
"But not yet, yes?" He laughed.

1003
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,560
This team was not ready for death.

1004
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,039
Later that evening, two guards came to find Maximus.

1005
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:25,800
They took him to Proximo.

1006
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,359
"Ah, Spaniard," he said, sending the guards away.

1007
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:34,399
"It worries me that although you're good, you could be
better. You could be the greatest."

1008
01:25:34,439 --> 01:25:37,760
"You want me to kill. I kill," Maximus said.

1009
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,479
"That's enough." He turned to walk out.

1010
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:44,800
"Enough for a small Moroccan town like this," Proximo called
after him.

1011
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,479
"But not for Rome."

1012
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:47,760
Maximus stopped.

1013
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,720
"Rome?" he said, suddenly interested.

1014
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,000
"My men have just brought the news," Proximo said.

1015
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:07,520
"The young Emperor has arranged some games in honor of his dead father, Marcus Aurelius. It's strange to think that I
had to leave my school in Rome years ago because his father stopped all gladiator contests. But his day has ended now."

1016
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,840
"Yes," said Maximus, quietly, angrily.

1017
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,079
Proximo laughed.

1018
01:26:12,119 --> 01:26:18,039
"We're going back! After five years in this terrible place
we're going back to the Colosseum," he said.

1019
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:32,479
"Ah, Spaniard, wait until you fight in the Colosseum. Fifty thousand Romans following every move of your sword. The
silence before you strike. The cry that comes after-like a storm!" He stopped and looked to the heavens, his eyes shining.

1020
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:37,199
Maximus saw the memories lighting up Proximo's face and
suddenly he understood.

1021
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,720
"You were once a gladiator," he said.

1022
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,640
Proximo looked back at him.

1023
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,319
"The best," he said.

1024
01:26:43,319 --> 01:26:46,119
"You won your freedom?" Maximus asked.

1025
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:52,199
"A long time ago." Proximo went into the next room and came
back carrying a small wooden sword.

1026
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:57,920
"The Emperor gave me this. A sign of freedom. He touched me
on the shoulder and I was free."

1027
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:04,279
On the handle of the sword was Proximo's name and the words,
"Free man-By Order of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius."

1028
01:27:04,279 --> 01:27:08,520
"I, too, want to stand in front of the Emperor, as you did."

1029
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,000
"Then listen to me," said Proximo.

1030
01:27:11,000 --> 01:29:59,960
"Learn from me. I was not the best because I killed quickly. I was the best because the crowd loved me. Win the crowd,
and you'll win your freedom."

1031
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
Maximus knew that he was right.

1032
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
"I'll win the crowd. I'll give them something they've never
seen before."

1033
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
In the royal palace Commodus stood looking down at Lucius,
asleep in his bed.

1034
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
Lucilla entered quietly behind him.

1035
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
She stood in the doorway, watching, worried.

1036
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
"He sleeps so well because he is loved," said Commodus,
gently brushing a hair from Lucius's face.

1037
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
Lucilla moved forward quickly.

1038
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
Lucius turned over and she thought he was waking.

1039
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
"Shh... go back to sleep now," she said.

1040
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
She pulled his blanket closer and watched him breathe
deeply, already dreaming again.

1041
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
"Come, brother, it's late," she said, turning away and
knowing he would follow her.

1042
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
Back in his own room Commodus sat on the bed and picked up a
document.

1043
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
He looked at it, then let it fall to the floor.

1044
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
The table next to his bed was covered in other papers-plans
for the New Rome and documents from the Senate.

1045
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
"I can't sleep," he complained.

1046
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
"The Senate is always sending me papers. And my own dreams
for Rome are making my head ache."

1047
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
Lucilla prepared a drink for him, secretly mixing in some
medicine.

1048
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
"Quiet, brother, this will help." She held out the drink to
him and watched as he drank it.

1049
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
"Are the people ready for me to close the Senate yet? What do you think? Should I have the senators killed? Some or all
of them?" he asked Lucilla.

1050
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
"We'll talk about it tomorrow. Sleep now," she said.

1051
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
She thought to herself, "Rome is in frightening hands. Thank
the gods that I am here to control him."

1052
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,960
"Will you stay with me?" Commodus asked Lucilla.

1053
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:00,000
"Still afraid of the dark, brother?" Lucilla smiled gently,
kissed him, and then started to go.

1054
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
She stopped at the door and looked back.

1055
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Commodus lay on the bed, a lonely figure, his eyes wide
open.

1056
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
"Sleep, brother," Lucilla said.

1057
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
"You know my dreams would bring terror to the world," he
said.

1058
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Lucilla left.

1059
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
When she was certain that Commodus was asleep, Lucilla
quietly left the palace.

1060
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
She went to Senator Gracchus's house, and there in the
darkness Gaius was waiting for her.

1061
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
He took her arm and led her into the house, where Gracchus
met them in the hall.

1062
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
He turned to Lucilla.

1063
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
"Do you know, there was a time, not very long ago, when I
held two children on my knee," he said with a kind smile.

1064
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
"They were the most beautiful children I'd ever seen. And their father was very proud of them. I, too, loved them very
much, like my own."

1065
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
"And they loved you," said Lucilla.

1066
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
"I saw one of them grow strong and good," Gracchus
continued.

1067
01:30:00,000 --> 01:32:44,920
"The other grew... dark. I watched as his father turned away
from him. We all turned away from him. And as he became more and more lonely, there was more hate than love in his heart." Gracchus shook his head sadly.

1068
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,960
They went into the main room and Gracchus gave his guests
glasses of wine.

1069
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,439
Lucilla spoke first.

1070
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:54,720
"Anyone who says anything against the Emperor is in danger
now," she said.

1071
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:58,680
"Students, teachers, writers... we must be careful."

1072
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:03,119
"All to feed the arena. I'm afraid to go out after dark,"
said Gaius.

1073
01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:06,199
"You should be more afraid in the day," said Gracchus.

1074
01:33:06,199 --> 01:33:11,760
"The Senate is full of Falco's spies." He took a glass of
wine and sat next to Lucilla.

1075
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:16,520
"What is in Commodus's mind? These games are all he seems to
care about."

1076
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:19,680
"And how is he paying for them?" asked Gaius.

1077
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:23,880
"They must cost a fortune each day, but we have no new
taxes."

1078
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,520
"The future is paying," Lucilla answered.

1079
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:37,479
"He's started selling the wheat we have saved. In two years time the people will die of hunger. I hope they're enjoying
the games now because soon these games will be the reason their children are dead."

1080
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,960
"This can't be true," said Gaius.

1081
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,720
"Rome must know this."

1082
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:44,680
"And who will tell them?" asked Lucilla.

1083
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:53,840
"You, Gaius? Or you, Gracchus? Will you make a speech in the Senate and then see your family killed in the Colosseum?"
She looked from one man to the other.

1084
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,800
"He must die," she said.

1085
01:33:55,800 --> 01:34:00,199
"Quintus and the guards would take control themselves," said
Gaius.

1086
01:34:00,199 --> 01:34:05,000
"And we haven't got enough men. The army may not be loyal to
us," said Gracchus.

1087
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:19,760
"No, we must wait, prepare, and be ready. We can do nothing while he has the support of the people. But every day he
makes more enemies. One day he will have more enemies than friends, and then we will strike. Until then, we must be patient."

1088
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:23,279
Proximo and his gladiators were near Rome by late afternoon.

1089
01:34:23,319 --> 01:34:27,920
Proximo could see that something had changed since he left
five years before.

1090
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,840
Rome had become an army camp.

1091
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,439
When they were inside the city walls, he noticed other
things.

1092
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:36,399
The city was poorer and dirtier than he remembered it.

1093
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:41,800
At last they arrived at Proximo's old school, where the
gates were still locked as he had left them.

1094
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,439
The gladiators were glad to get out of the box they had
traveled in.

1095
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:46,680
They looked around.

1096
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:52,760
Across the rooftops of Rome, only a short distance away, was
an enormous building: the great Colosseum.

1097
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:59,279
Maximus, Juba, and the others stared at it, listening to the
sound of 50,000 voices shouting for blood.

1098
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:02,439
Each man was thinking, "Is that where I die?"

1099
01:35:02,439 --> 01:35:06,159
From the great arena came another sound: "Caesar! Caesar!

1100
01:35:06,199 --> 01:35:16,279
Proximo knew this meant that the Emperor had just arrived. He looked across at Maximus. "Win the crowd" he said softly.
Maximus had only one thought: "He is there.

1101
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:17,319
He is close.

1102
01:35:17,319 --> 01:35:21,560
The time is coming when I will see him myself: the man I
live to kill."

1103
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:27,119
It was late morning of the following day when Maximus and
the other gladiators were taken to the Colosseum.

1104
01:35:27,159 --> 01:35:29,960
They were put into cages under the seats of the arena.

1105
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:36,079
Crowds of people came past to look at the new fighters, to
guess which ones were winners and which would die.

1106
01:35:36,119 --> 01:35:40,000
Maximus sat at the back of the cage, taking no notice of
them.

1107
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:46,680
He could hear Proximo talking loudly to a man called
Cassius, whose job was to organize the contests in the
Colosseum.

1108
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,760
He also had to please the Emperor.

1109
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,079
"The Emperor wants battles?" Proximo shouted.

1110
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:59,920
"My men are highly trained single fighters. I refuse to let them die like that. They will be wasted in this stupid piece
of theater."

1111
01:35:59,920 --> 01:37:28,600
"The crowd wants battles, so the Emperor gives them battles," Cassius replied, "and your gladiators are going to
act the Battle of Carthage. You have no choice."

1112
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:31,199
Their voices grew quieter as they walked away.

1113
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:36,199
Among the passing crowds were some young boys from rich
families, watched by their servants.

1114
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:40,640
Maximus took no notice of them until a voice suddenly made
him turn his head.

1115
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:46,239
"Gladiator!" It was one of the boys, fair-haired and about
the same age as Maximus's son.

1116
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:50,239
"Gladiator, are you the one they call 'the Spaniard?'" he
asked.

1117
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:52,439
Maximus moved closer to the boy.

1118
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:53,920
"Yes," he said.

1119
01:37:53,920 --> 01:38:00,720
"They said you were enormous. They said you could squeeze a man's head until it broke, with just one hand," said the
boy.

1120
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,840
Maximus looked down at his hand.

1121
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:07,199
"A man's? No..." he said He held out his hand and smiled.

1122
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:08,920
"But maybe a boy's..."

1123
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,319
The boy smiled back.

1124
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:12,840
"I like you, Spaniard," he said.

1125
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,560
"I shall cheer for you."

1126
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,000
Maximus was shocked.

1127
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,840
"They let you watch the games?" he asked.

1128
01:38:18,840 --> 01:39:59,960
"My uncle says they will make me strong," the boy replied.

1129
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"But what does your father say?"

1130
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"My father's dead."

1131
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
The boy's servant came to him and took his hand.

1132
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"Come, Lucius. It's time to go."

1133
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"Your name's Lucius?" asked Maximus.

1134
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"Lucius Verus, like my father," Lucius said proudly.

1135
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
He turned and left, followed by the servant.

1136
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
With a shock, Maximus suddenly realized that the boy must be
Lucilla's son.

1137
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
He searched the crowd-was Lucilla somewhere out there?

1138
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
But although he kept looking, he could not see her.

1139
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
He could only see the faces of people who were thirsty for
blood.

1140
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
CHAPTER EIGHT

1141
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
The Colosseum

1142
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
The gladiators waited for their contest in an area that was
at the same level as the sand of the arena.

1143
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
In there they were given helmets, body armor, and swords.

1144
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
Proximo's guards led his gladiators into the area and Maximus walked over to a window He looked out at the sand
that seemed to continue forever.

1145
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
Maximus spoke in a low voice to one of the guards.

1146
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"Is the Emperor here?" he asked.

1147
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"He'll be here," the guard replied.

1148
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"He comes every day."

1149
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
One of the guards held out a helmet to Maximus.

1150
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
He shook his head and looked instead at the other helmets.

1151
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
He chose one with a better face guard and tried it on.

1152
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
He turned his head back toward the arena, knowing that now
his face could not be recognized.

1153
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
Proximo's gladiators were armored and ready.

1154
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
They were dressed to look like soldiers from Carthage.

1155
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
They carried spears and long, curved, heavy shields.

1156
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
As they waited to go out into the arena, an official spoke
to them.

1157
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"You have the honor of fighting in front of the Emperor
himself," he said.

1158
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"When the Emperor enters, raise your spears in salute. When
you salute him, speak together," he said.

1159
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"Face the Emperor. Don't turn your backs."

1160
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"Go," Proximo said.

1161
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
"Die with honor." His five best gladiators walked past him
and onto the sand of the arena.

1162
01:39:59,960 --> 01:39:59,960
Maximus was the last to step onto the floor of the great
Colosseum.

1163
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:00,000
He had never imagined such a sight.

1164
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
There were thousands and thousands of screaming, shouting
people.

1165
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
All around him was an ocean of cheering faces.

1166
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
It took his breath away.

1167
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
The gladiators moved into the center of the sand.

1168
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
At the same time, three other teams appeared in the arena
from different entrances.

1169
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
There was now a total of twenty gladiators on the Colosseum
stage.

1170
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
All wore the same armor and carried long double-pointed
spears and heavy metal shields.

1171
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
They stood in a line and faced the Emperor's seat.

1172
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
It was still empty.

1173
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Fifty royal guards surrounded the area where Commodus and
his friends would sit.

1174
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Then Commodus and Lucilla entered-and the crowd went wild,
cheering and shouting salutes.

1175
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Lucilla and Lucius went to their seats.

1176
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Commodus moved forward and waved to the crowd.

1177
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Gaius and other senators near the Emperor watched in
silence.

1178
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
They had just heard the latest news: To help pay for the games, Commodus was taking the houses and money of senators
he disliked.

1179
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Commodus looked down at the gladiators, and Maximus froze as
he felt his eyes rest on him.

1180
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
He stared up at the man he hated and wanted to kill.

1181
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
On one side of Commodus he saw Quintus.

1182
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
On the other side, Lucilla and Lucius.

1183
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
The distance between them was too great-this was not his
chance.

1184
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
He knew there would be a better one.

1185
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
When Cassius gave a sign, the gladiators all saluted with their spears and shouted, "Caesar-we salute you before we
die!" Only Maximus was silent.

1186
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Cassius stepped forward to introduce the afternoon's event.

1187
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:54,800
"On this day we reach back into history to bring you the
Battle of Carthage!" The crowd cheered loudly.

1188
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:59,600
They laughed at the gladiators, dressed as the soldiers of
Carthage, the battle's losers.

1189
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:06,399
Then Cassius continued, "On that great day the gods sent
them against Rome's greatest soldiers-the Army of Africa!"

1190
01:41:06,399 --> 01:41:12,960
The crowd cheered again as the doors at the ends of the arena suddenly opened with a crash, and six chariots came in
from each end.

1191
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:17,119
The chariots raced through the line of gladiators, who
jumped out of the way.

1192
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:20,399
They turned and came back, running over one gladiator.

1193
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:25,800
Then the chariots raced around the outside of the arena,
forcing the gladiators back into the center.

1194
01:41:25,840 --> 01:44:16,000
It was difficult for the men on foot to see well through the
cloud of dust and sand from the wheels of the chariots.

1195
01:44:16,039 --> 01:44:19,680
As they thundered past, Maximus saw a spear flying through
the air.

1196
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:23,239
It hit one of the gladiators in the neck and killed him
immediately.

1197
01:44:23,319 --> 01:44:32,239
Maximus could see that he must take control and he called to the other gladiators, "If we work together, we can win!" He
made them move in closer.

1198
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:36,560
"Shields together! Shoulders against the shields!" he
called.

1199
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:39,560
The gladiators followed his orders-except for one.

1200
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,680
Haken stood alone, ready to fight his own battle.

1201
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:44,600
The crowd was very surprised.

1202
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,199
They had never seen anything like this before!

1203
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:53,680
The men in the chariots circled around the group firing
arrows and spears, but they only hit the gladiators'
shields.

1204
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:56,680
A Roman spear from one chariot hit Haken in the leg.

1205
01:44:56,720 --> 01:45:02,239
Juba threw his spear and killed the driver, and Maximus
pulled Haken into the safety of the group.

1206
01:45:02,239 --> 01:45:04,880
Two chariots drove straight at the gladiators.

1207
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:07,840
Fixed to their wheels were short, sharp spears.

1208
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,880
As the wheels turned, they could cut a man to pieces.

1209
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:15,359
But the shields were good protection, and the wheel spears
broke when they hit them.

1210
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:19,800
The wheel of one chariot hit the corner of a shield, and the
chariot turned over.

1211
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:24,000
Another driver, close behind, crashed into it and was thrown
out.

1212
01:45:24,039 --> 01:45:28,520
His chariot raced on, and its wheel spears killed him as he
tried to get away.

1213
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:32,760
A third chariot was very close, and both vehicles crashed
into the gate.

1214
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:36,640
Maximus ran for one of the broken chariots and cut the horse
free.

1215
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:40,279
He jumped onto the horse and rode fast toward one chariot.

1216
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:42,680
The driver was watching Maximus carefully.

1217
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:45,840
He did not see that he was very close to another vehicle.

1218
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,119
Their wheels touched.

1219
01:45:47,159 --> 01:45:49,359
Both drivers were thrown onto the sand.

1220
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:53,920
One was killed by Maximus's spear, and the other died under
the feet of his horse.

1221
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:59,399
The gladiators pulled two crashed chariots into the path of
the others, who were forced to slow down.

1222
01:45:59,399 --> 01:46:02,920
Then they rushed at the drivers, striking them with their
spears.

1223
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,520
Maximus looked around.

1224
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,000
All their enemies were dead.

1225
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,439
He climbed down from his horse, and the gladiators stood on
either side of him.

1226
01:46:10,439 --> 01:46:12,000
Haken was among them.

1227
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,039
In the arena, Maximus, for the first time, raised his right
arm and sword high.

1228
01:46:17,039 --> 01:46:20,000
It was the gladiators' traditional sign of beating death.

1229
01:46:20,039 --> 01:46:21,720
The crowd cheered wildly.

1230
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,600
Commodus called for Cassius.

1231
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:28,960
"My history is not so good," he said, "but I thought we won
the Battle of Carthage."

1232
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:32,880
"Yes, sir," said Cassius, his voice shaking with fear.

1233
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,199
"Forgive me."

1234
01:46:34,199 --> 01:46:36,920
"Oh, I'm not unhappy," said Commodus.

1235
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:40,199
"I enjoy surprises." He pointed to Maximus.

1236
01:46:40,199 --> 01:46:41,439
"Who is he?"

1237
01:46:41,439 --> 01:46:44,000
"They call him the Spaniard, sir."

1238
01:46:44,039 --> 01:46:46,680
"I think I'll meet him," said Commodus.

1239
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:48,960
The gladiators were almost at the gate.

1240
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:53,560
Maximus turned and saw the Emperor walking out onto the
sand, smiling at him.

1241
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:59,359
He noticed a broken arrow in the sand and, as he fell to his
knees he quickly closed his hand around it.

1242
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:00,840
This would be his chance.

1243
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:05,560
Commodus was nearly there... just a little further... almost
close enough to kill.

1244
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,880
Maximus was ready...

1245
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,319
Suddenly, Lucius ran out and took Commodus by the hand.

1246
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:14,920
Commodus laughed and moved the boy in front of him, facing
the gladiator hero.

1247
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:17,720
Maximus could not strike-Lucius was in the way.

1248
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:20,840
"Stand, stand," said Commodus to Maximus.

1249
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:26,319
"Now, why doesn't the hero tell us his real name?" Maximus
stood and said nothing.

1250
01:47:26,359 --> 01:47:29,039
"You do have a name?" asked Commodus.

1251
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:31,680
"My name is Gladiator," Maximus said.

1252
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,760
Then he turned and walked away.

1253
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:36,720
It was a great insult to turn his back on the Emperor.

1254
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:38,119
The crowd were shocked.

1255
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:39,720
Commodus was very angry.

1256
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:43,720
He made a sign to Quintus, who moved the royal guards into
the arena.

1257
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:47,760
They stood at the gate, swords ready, and did not let
Maximus pass.

1258
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:50,039
Commodus spoke calmly and clearly.

1259
01:47:50,079 --> 01:47:54,760
"Slave," he said, "you will remove your helmet and tell me
your name."

1260
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:57,239
Slowly, Maximus turned to face him.

1261
01:47:57,239 --> 01:47:59,119
He knew he had no choice now.

1262
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:00,680
He took off his helmet.

1263
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:01,880
Commodus stared.

1264
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:04,079
Quintus could not believe his eyes.

1265
01:48:04,119 --> 01:48:09,720
Lucilla recognized Maximus from her seat in the arena and
put her hand over her mouth in total shock.

1266
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:12,319
Maximus spoke in a clear, proud voice.

1267
01:48:12,399 --> 01:48:22,920
"My name is Maximus Decimus Meridas, Commander of the Army of the North, General of the Western Armies, loyal servant
to the true Emperor, Marcus Aurelius" The Colosseum was completely silent.

1268
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:25,960
Then he turned to Commodus and spoke more quietly.

1269
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:32,640
"I am father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife,
and I will punish their killer, in this life or the next."

1270
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:36,039
Commodus gave a sign to his guards and they moved closer.

1271
01:48:36,079 --> 01:49:59,960
The crowd shouted out.

1272
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
They had seen enough deaths for one afternoon and they did
not want their hero to be the next one.

1273
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
They reached out a forest of thumbs, pointing up to the
heavens.

1274
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
Their meaning was clear-Let him live!

1275
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
Commodus looked around at his people and with great
difficulty he forced himself to smile.

1276
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
He slowly lifted his own thumb.

1277
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
The crowd cheered.

1278
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
"Maximus! Maximus!" they shouted.

1279
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
Lucilla and the senators could not believe the scene
happening in front of them.

1280
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
Another shocked face was watching from his seat in the
Colosseum.

1281
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
It was Cicero, Maximus's servant in the army.

1282
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
As he watched the General, his mind saw many possibilities.

1283
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
Maximus led his men from the arena.

1284
01:49:59,960 --> 01:49:59,960
He looked back just once, from the gate, and thought, "The
battle hasn't ended yet."

1285
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:00,000
In the darkness of the palace Lucilla stopped in front of
the doors to Commodus's room.

1286
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
She took a deep breath before she entered.

1287
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Commodus sat calmly at his desk, signing papers.

1288
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Lucilla was surprised that he was not still in a violent
temper.

1289
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
When he returned from the Colosseum, he had screamed in
anger and attacked a picture of Marcus Aurelius.

1290
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Now he was quieter and behaving quite normally.

1291
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
She walked up to the desk.

1292
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
"Why is he still alive?" he asked her.

1293
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
"I don't know," she said.

1294
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
"He shouldn't be alive," her brother said.

1295
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
"That makes me angry. I am terribly angry."

1296
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Lucilla watched him carefully, waiting for an explosion.

1297
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
"I only did the things I had to do," said Commodus.

1298
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
"Father's plan was crazy-the Empire... Rome... they must
continue. You do understand that, don't you?"

1299
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
"Yes," replied Lucilla.

1300
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
He moved to the tall window and looked out at Rome, quiet
now in the late night.

1301
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
"They lied to me in Germany. They told me he was dead. If they lie to me, they don't honor me. If they don't honor me,
how can they ever love me?"

1302
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Maximus was lying awake in the dark of the prison when he
heard a guard coming.

1303
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
He was on his feet immediately.

1304
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
The guard entered and took Maximus along to another prison
room.

1305
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
He chained him to the wall and left without a word.

1306
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
And into the light stepped a woman.

1307
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Lucilla.

1308
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Maximus stared at her.

1309
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
"I knew your brother would send one of his killers," he
said.

1310
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
"I didn't think he would send his best."

1311
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
"Maximus, he doesn't know..." Lucilla began.

1312
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:57,560
"My family were burnt alive!" Maximus interrupted, throwing
the words at her in anger.

1313
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:01,960
"I knew nothing of that, you must believe me. I cried for
them."

1314
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,079
"As you cried for your father?" said Maximus.

1315
01:51:05,079 --> 01:51:09,079
"I have been living in a prison of fear since that day,"
Lucilla said.

1316
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:12,800
"I live in terror for my son because he will be the next
emperor..."

1317
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,399
"My son was innocent," said Maximus.

1318
01:51:15,399 --> 01:51:17,560
"So is mine," she replied.

1319
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:21,000
"Must my son die, too, before you'll trust me?"

1320
01:51:21,039 --> 01:51:23,039
Maximus began then to relax.

1321
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:26,680
"Why does it matter if I trust you or not?" he asked.

1322
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:32,960
"The gods have allowed you to live. Today I saw a slave
become more powerful than the Emperor of Rome," she said.

1323
01:51:33,000 --> 01:54:27,399
"Use that power, Maximus. My brother has many enemies, but until today no one was strong enough to face him. The people
were with you, they would follow you."

1324
01:54:27,439 --> 01:54:31,199
"I am only one man. What possible difference can I make?"

1325
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:38,960
"Some politicians have worked all their lives for the good of Rome-one man above all. If I can arrange it, will you
meet him?" she asked.

1326
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:45,439
"Don't you understand? I could be killed tonight in this
prison-or tomorrow in the arena. I'm just a slave now."

1327
01:54:45,439 --> 01:54:48,760
"This man wants the same things as you," said Lucilla.

1328
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:52,319
"Then let him kill Commodus!" Maximus said in anger.

1329
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:55,079
Lucilla searched for a way to make him understand.

1330
01:54:55,079 --> 01:54:57,319
"I knew a man once," she said.

1331
01:54:57,319 --> 01:55:02,520
"He loved my father very much and my father loved him. This
man served Rome well."

1332
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,880
"That man is gone," said Maximus.

1333
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:07,159
"Your brother did his work well."

1334
01:55:07,159 --> 01:55:09,439
"Let me help you," said Lucilla.

1335
01:55:09,439 --> 01:55:14,079
"Yes, you can help me. Forget you ever knew me," Maximus
replied.

1336
01:55:14,119 --> 01:55:17,520
"And never come here again." He shouted for the guard.

1337
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,119
"This lady has finished with me," he said.

1338
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:23,079
The guard unlocked the door and led Maximus away.

1339
01:55:23,079 --> 01:55:24,279
CHAPTER NINE

1340
01:55:24,279 --> 01:55:25,560
A Man for the People

1341
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:29,000
Senator Gracchus climbed the many stairs inside the
Colosseum.

1342
01:55:29,039 --> 01:55:33,560
He listened to the shouting crowd and he was not
enthusiastic about being there.

1343
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:36,680
He joined a group of other senators near the top of the
arena.

1344
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:39,720
"Senator Gracchus," Falco said with surprise.

1345
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:43,199
"We don't often see you enjoying the pleasures of the
crowd."

1346
01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:46,640
"I don't pretend to be a man of the people," said Gracchus.

1347
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:49,359
"But I do try to be a man for the people."

1348
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:50,880
The Colosseum was full.

1349
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:55,520
The crowd was already beginning to shout the name of their
hero and favorite gladiator.

1350
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:58,520
"Maximus... Maximus... Maximus."

1351
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:01,800
Cassius started to introduce the next event of the day.

1352
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:09,159
"Now, as we celebrate the sixty-fourth day of the games, you will see how kind the Emperor is and how he loves his
people!"

1353
01:56:09,159 --> 01:56:12,119
Servants came into the arena pulling great boxes.

1354
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:15,159
They removed the covers and took out loaves of bread.

1355
01:56:15,159 --> 01:56:17,800
Then they started to throw them into the crowd.

1356
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:21,720
Other servants appeared at the top of the steps and threw
the bread down.

1357
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:23,479
There were thousands of loaves.

1358
01:56:23,479 --> 01:56:26,600
The crowd cheered and caught as many loaves as they could.

1359
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:29,680
Commodus chose this as the best time for him to enter.

1360
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:33,279
Below, in the prison area, Proximo stood with Maximus.

1361
01:56:33,319 --> 01:56:35,880
They heard a great cheer go up from the crowd.

1362
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:39,359
"He certainly knows how to please them," said Proximo.

1363
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:43,600
"Marcus Aurelius had a dream for Rome, Proximo," said
Maximus.

1364
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,039
"This is not it."

1365
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:49,159
"Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus," Proximo reminded him.

1366
01:56:49,159 --> 01:56:53,960
In the arena the servants had thrown all the bread to the
crowd, and Cassius spoke again.

1367
01:56:53,960 --> 01:57:05,720
"The Emperor has decided there will be a special contest today. Five years after his last fight in the Colosseum, we
bring you the greatest gladiator in Roman history! Today Tigris of France returns!"

1368
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:11,199
The crowd loved a surprise and they cheered in excitement as
Tigris drove his chariot into the arena.

1369
01:57:11,239 --> 01:57:14,880
He was a large man of about forty-five and he looked
dangerous.

1370
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:18,520
He wore silver armor and a silver tiger helmet with a face
guard.

1371
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:23,119
The bright sun shone off his helmet as he rode around the
arena with his arm held high.

1372
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:25,960
The crowd shouted and cheered even more loudly.

1373
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,479
Tigris stopped his chariot, got down, and waited in the
center of the arena.

1374
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:33,960
He was carrying a sword and a spear and he looked
frightening.

1375
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,880
When the crowd became quieter, Cassius started to speak
again.

1376
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:44,319
"And from the great school of Aelius Proximo... Caesar is
pleased to give you... the Spaniard, Maximus!"

1377
01:57:44,319 --> 01:57:47,039
There were more cheers and shouts from the crowd.

1378
01:57:47,079 --> 01:57:49,039
Maximus appeared from his gate.

1379
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:52,560
He was carrying only a short sword and a round silver
shield.

1380
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:54,399
He had no armor or helmet.

1381
01:57:54,399 --> 01:59:59,960
Among the crowd that day were a group of people who did not
usually go to watch gladiator games.

1382
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
They were soldiers from the Army of the North, with Valerius
and Cicero at their center.

1383
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
They had come to see if it was true that their general was
really still alive.

1384
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
When he got close enough for them to recognize him, they
were very happy.

1385
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
They shouted to Maximus, but he could not hear their voices
among so many others.

1386
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
Commodus was also watching Maximus closely.

1387
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
"They love him like one of their own," he said to Lucilla.

1388
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
"The crowd has its favorite for a time-then they find
someone new. He'll be forgotten in a month," she replied.

1389
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
"No," said Commodus, smiling.

1390
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
"Much sooner than that. It's been arranged."

1391
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
Down on the arena sand, Maximus looked at Tigris.

1392
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
"Only one man with a sword and spear?" he thought.

1393
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
"Something's wrong. What don't I know?"

1394
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
Maximus stopped a short distance from Tigris.

1395
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
They saluted each other, and then Tigris turned to the
Emperor and raised his sword.

1396
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
"Before we die, we salute you," he said.

1397
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
Maximus did not turn to the Emperor, or salute him.

1398
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
Instead, he bent down and picked up some sand, then let it
run through his fingers.

1399
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
Tigris pulled down the face guard on his helmet.

1400
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
Then he immediately attacked Maximus.

1401
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
Maximus struck back at him.

1402
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
The two men were equal contestants-both strong and fast.

1403
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
Maximus was the younger man and he was very confident.

1404
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
He believed that he would not be killed that day.

1405
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
As they fought, Maximus suddenly heard a strange noise.

1406
01:59:59,960 --> 01:59:59,960
He could not understand where it was coming from.

1407
01:59:59,960 --> 02:00:00,000
Then he felt the ground move.

1408
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Suddenly, a door opened in the sand behind him and an
enormous tiger came out.

1409
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000
It jumped at him.

1410
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000
He felt the tiger's breath on his back as he moved quickly to one side, and he expected the animal to land on top of
him.

1411
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000
But when he looked, he saw that it was on the end of a long
chain.

1412
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000
This was held tightly by three men near the wall.

1413
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Tigris attacked again with great strength, forcing Maximus
back toward the tiger.

1414
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,439
Maximus also attacked, and drove Tigris in a new direction.

1415
02:00:03,479 --> 02:00:07,800
Then a second door opened in the sand, and another tiger
jumped into the arena.

1416
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:13,920
Maximus found a new position and continued to fight, as two
more tigers suddenly appeared from the ground.

1417
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:17,399
There were now four tigers, one in each corner of the
battlefield.

1418
02:00:17,399 --> 02:00:21,279
Maximus had five enemies to fight and he looked for a weak
point.

1419
02:00:21,279 --> 02:00:24,520
Then it seemed that all four tigers were suddenly closer!

1420
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:26,800
Maximus realized what was happening.

1421
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:31,000
When Tigris was near a tiger, the men holding the chain
pulled it in a little.

1422
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,239
When Maximus was near, they let the chain out further.

1423
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:38,279
Finally, Maximus's strength and speed began to beat Tigris.

1424
02:00:38,279 --> 02:00:41,720
He knocked Tigris back and they fell onto the sand together.

1425
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:46,680
Maximus quickly jumped to his feet and stood over him, his
sword at his throat.

1426
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:51,439
But then one of the teams of servants let go of the chain
and a tiger ran at Maximus.

1427
02:00:51,479 --> 02:00:56,000
He just had time to turn and push his sword upward into the
tiger's shoulders.

1428
02:00:56,039 --> 02:00:58,479
The animal fell on top of him and died.

1429
02:00:58,479 --> 02:01:04,119
This gave Tigris enough time to get to his feet, pick up his
sword, and prepare to attack again.

1430
02:01:04,119 --> 02:01:10,319
Maximus was under the heavy body of the dead tiger but he
still had enough strength to throw his shield up at Tigris.

1431
02:01:10,319 --> 02:01:14,039
It hit Tigris hard on the face guard of his helmet and bent
it.

1432
02:01:14,079 --> 02:01:16,439
It was impossible for him to see through it.

1433
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:22,079
Tigris was forced to drop his sword again so he could use
both hands to try to pull the cover up.

1434
02:01:22,119 --> 02:01:26,880
Maximus was able to squeeze out from under the tiger and
pick up Tigris's sword.

1435
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:31,720
The Frenchman was still blindly pulling at his helmet as
Maximus knocked him to the ground.

1436
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:35,359
Maximus stood over Tigris with his sword point at his
throat.

1437
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:36,840
He looked to Commodus.

1438
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:39,439
All eyes in the Colosseum turned to the Emperor.

1439
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:42,479
Commodus was very angry but tried not to show it.

1440
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:45,239
He slowly stood and looked down at Maximus.

1441
02:01:45,239 --> 02:01:48,439
He raised his arm and held out his hand-thumb down.

1442
02:01:48,479 --> 02:01:56,640
Maximus raised his sword to kill Tigris... but suddenly
threw it down on the sand, next to his head.

1443
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:58,720
"You fought with honor," he said.

1444
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:02,239
The crowd was silent, then suddenly there was an enormous
cheer.

1445
02:02:02,279 --> 02:02:06,359
The shouts of "Maximus... Maximus..." grew louder and
louder.

1446
02:02:06,359 --> 02:02:08,960
Commodus turned and disappeared from sight.

1447
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:14,680
Senator Gracchus suddenly sat forward and started to take a
real interest in the behavior of the crowd.

1448
02:02:14,720 --> 02:05:05,720
Maximus was almost at the gladiators' exit from the arena
when a group of royal guards appeared in front of him.

1449
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:09,920
They stepped back as Commodus walked through them and toward
the great fighter.

1450
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,880
Maximus and Commodus stared at each other, just an arm's
length away.

1451
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:17,359
The crowd was quiet now but they could not hear what was
said.

1452
02:05:17,359 --> 02:05:20,439
"What am I going to do with you?" said Commodus.

1453
02:05:20,439 --> 02:05:22,079
Maximus did not reply.

1454
02:05:22,079 --> 02:05:25,039
"Once more I offer you my hand," Commodus said.

1455
02:05:25,039 --> 02:05:28,159
He held out his arm, but Maximus did not move.

1456
02:05:28,199 --> 02:05:31,439
"Are we so different, you and I?" said Commodus.

1457
02:05:31,479 --> 02:05:34,600
"You take life when you have to, just as I do."

1458
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:37,640
"I have one more life to take," said Maximus.

1459
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:39,279
"Then it is finished."

1460
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:41,800
"Then take it now," said Commodus.

1461
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:47,039
Maximus knew he only had to take one step toward Commodus
and the guards would kill him.

1462
02:05:47,039 --> 02:05:49,960
He turned his back on the Emperor and walked away.

1463
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:51,399
The crowd went mad!

1464
02:05:51,399 --> 02:05:53,560
They cheered Maximus, their hero.

1465
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:57,439
And then some started laughing at the Emperor and throwing
bread at him.

1466
02:05:57,439 --> 02:05:59,439
Gracchus could not believe his eyes.

1467
02:05:59,439 --> 02:06:02,439
Such insults to the Emperor usually resulted in death.

1468
02:06:02,479 --> 02:06:04,520
But the people were not afraid now.

1469
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:06,880
All this, because of one brave man.

1470
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:11,840
Maximus and the gladiators were chained together again for
the walk back to Proximo's school.

1471
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:16,119
There were guards walking with them, trying to keep back
hundreds of people.

1472
02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:18,920
They all wanted to get a close look at their hero.

1473
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:23,439
Suddenly, Maximus heard a familiar voice and saw Cicero
ahead in the crowd.

1474
02:06:23,439 --> 02:06:26,439
"Where are you camped?" he shouted to Cicero.

1475
02:06:26,439 --> 02:06:29,600
"A day's ride from Rome-at Ostia," replied Cicero.

1476
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:33,920
"We've been there all winter. The men are getting fat.
They're bored."

1477
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:37,279
"How soon could they be ready to fight?" asked Maximus,

1478
02:06:37,319 --> 02:06:40,880
"For you, sir? Tomorrow," Cicero said proudly.

1479
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:43,520
The guards pushed Cicero back into the crowd.

1480
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:48,199
He ran ahead and came out in front of Maximus again, further
along the street.

1481
02:06:48,199 --> 02:06:51,600
This time he pushed a small package into Maximus's hand.

1482
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:55,399
The guards were close and Maximus knew he only had one
chance.

1483
02:06:55,399 --> 02:06:58,520
"Cicero! Listen carefully!" he said.

1484
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:03,840
"You must contact Lucilla, the Emperor's sister. Tell her I
will meet her politician."

1485
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:05,359
There was no more time.

1486
02:07:05,359 --> 02:07:09,560
Cicero disappeared into the crowd, and Maximus was forced to
move on.

1487
02:07:09,560 --> 02:07:16,119
Later, alone in the prison at Proximo's school, Maximus took
the little package out of his pocket and looked at it.

1488
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:19,319
Inside were the two wooden figures of his wife and son.

1489
02:07:19,319 --> 02:07:22,159
"Do they hear you?" a voice suddenly asked.

1490
02:07:22,159 --> 02:07:24,439
Maximus looked up into Juba's eyes.

1491
02:07:24,439 --> 02:07:28,000
"Your people," said Juba, "in the next world."

1492
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,079
"Yes" said Maximus, looking down at the figures.

1493
02:07:31,079 --> 02:07:32,560
Juba thought about it.

1494
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:34,479
"What do you say to them?"

1495
02:07:34,479 --> 02:07:36,359
Maximus looked at his friend.

1496
02:07:36,359 --> 02:07:40,720
"To my son, to keep his head up when he rides his horse," he
said.

1497
02:07:40,720 --> 02:09:59,960
"And to my wife... that's private."

1498
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
Juba smiled.

1499
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
CHAPTER TEN

1500
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
Secrets and Lies

1501
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
Commodus walked up and down in his room.

1502
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
He was a worried man.

1503
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
There was one other person with him: Senator Falco.

1504
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
"An emperor cannot rule if he is not loved!" Commodus said
to Falco.

1505
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
"And now they love Maximus because he let Tigris live. I can't kill him now or they will hate me. But I can't just
let him continue like this-every day he adds another insult. It's like a bad dream."

1506
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
"Every day his power is greater," said Falco.

1507
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
"And the people are getting braver. The Senate sees it, too. This is not something that will go away in a few days or
weeks. Rome is beginning to move against you. He must die."

1508
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
"Then they will love him even more!" shouted Commodus.

1509
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
He began walking again and soon he was calmer.

1510
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
"When I went to the Senate today," he said, "I purposely told them about selling the wheat to pay for the games. And
what happened?"

1511
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
"Nothing," said Falco.

1512
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
"Exactly! Nothing!" said Commodus.

1513
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
"Even Gracchus was as silent as a mouse. Why?" He stopped
and looked out his window over Rome.

1514
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
"We must be quiet and patient, Caesar. We must let the enemy
come to us," said Falco.

1515
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
Commodus began to relax a little.

1516
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
"Have every senator followed," he ordered.

1517
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
"I want daily reports."

1518
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
It was easy to find Lucilla, but much harder to speak to
her.

1519
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
For two days Cicero stayed in the streets around the palace.

1520
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
Finally, he was lucky.

1521
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
Lucilla's carriage came toward him, surrounded by royal
guards.

1522
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
There were two other men following her carriage- but they
were not in uniform.

1523
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
One, a small man, was blind in one eye.

1524
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
He was one of Falco's secret police.

1525
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
He had been very good at watching senators, but now he had
been given a different job.

1526
02:09:59,960 --> 02:09:59,960
He was watching Lucilla.

1527
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:00,000
As the carriage passed, Cicero called out, "My lady! I served your father at Vindobona!" Lucilla heard but did not
pay him much attention.

1528
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
The guards pushed him away, and he ran around to the other
side of the carriage.

1529
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
"And I served General Maximus!" he said, when he got close
enough.

1530
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Lucilla called for her carriage to stop.

1531
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
She asked her servant for a coin and held it out to Cicero.

1532
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
"And I serve him still," he said, as he came closer to take
it.

1533
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Lucilla understood at once that he was a messenger.

1534
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
She told her guards to step back.

1535
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
"This is for your loyalty, soldier," she said.

1536
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Cicero took the coin and kissed her hand.

1537
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
He whispered, "A message from the General. He'll meet your
politician."

1538
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
It was enough.

1539
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Cicero stepped back into the crowd, and Lucilla's carriage
moved on.

1540
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Proximo's school was dark and quiet.

1541
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
The men were all asleep, except one.

1542
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Proximo went quietly to wake Maximus and then took him to
his own rooms.

1543
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Lucilla and Gracchus were there, waiting for Maximus.

1544
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Proximo turned and left immediately.

1545
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Lucilla introduced Gracchus to Maximus.

1546
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
"The Senate is with you?" asked Maximus.

1547
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
"The Senate? Yes, I can speak for them," Gracchus replied.

1548
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:34,000
"Can you buy my freedom and get me out of Rome?" asked
Maximus, wasting no time.

1549
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,680
"Why would I do that?"

1550
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:45,960
"Get me out of the city. Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia. My army is camped there. By the second night, I'll
be back with 5,000 men," said Maximus.

1551
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:48,760
"But there are new commanders," said Lucilla.

1552
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:50,439
"Loyal to Commodus."

1553
02:10:50,439 --> 02:10:54,039
"Let my men see me alive. They are still loyal to me."

1554
02:10:54,039 --> 02:10:56,319
"This is crazy," said Gracchus.

1555
02:10:56,319 --> 02:11:08,039
"No Roman army has entered the city in 100 years. This may be no better than the rule of Commodus. And what next? After
the battle to take control of Rome you'll take your men and just... leave?"

1556
02:11:08,039 --> 02:11:10,279
"I will leave," said Maximus.

1557
02:11:10,279 --> 02:11:14,399
"The soldiers will stay to protect you, under the command of
the Senate."

1558
02:11:14,439 --> 02:11:19,359
"When all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the
people?" asked Gracchus.

1559
02:11:19,399 --> 02:11:20,880
"Tell me why."

1560
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:25,439
"Because that was the last wish of a dying man," said
Maximus, quietly.

1561
02:11:25,479 --> 02:11:28,359
"I will kill Commodus and leave Rome to you."

1562
02:11:28,399 --> 02:11:31,119
There was silence, then Gracchus spoke again.

1563
02:11:31,119 --> 02:11:39,840
"Marcus Aurelius trusted you, his daughter trusts you. So I will trust you, too. Give me two days." He held out his hand
to Maximus.

1564
02:11:39,840 --> 02:14:22,760
"And stay alive."

1565
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:27,319
In his beautiful house Senator Gracchus listened to the
cheers coming from the Colosseum.

1566
02:14:27,319 --> 02:14:30,960
His servant helped him pack a large amount of money into a
bag.

1567
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:35,399
"Wait outside the Colosseum. He'll come to you," he told the
man.

1568
02:14:35,399 --> 02:14:39,319
Gracchus's servant left the house and walked toward the
Colosseum.

1569
02:14:39,359 --> 02:14:42,800
All the way he was followed by one of Falco's secret police.

1570
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:45,239
Proximo sat in a cafe and waited.

1571
02:14:45,279 --> 02:14:50,279
He seemed to be watching the crowd passing, but really he
was looking for Gracchus's servant.

1572
02:14:50,279 --> 02:14:54,640
He knew immediately when he saw him, but just continued
drinking his wine.

1573
02:14:54,680 --> 02:14:56,760
He looked up and down the street.

1574
02:14:56,800 --> 02:15:01,239
Suddenly, he saw a man standing by a door and he did not
like the look of him.

1575
02:15:01,279 --> 02:15:03,880
It was Falco's one-eyed secret policeman.

1576
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:09,439
Gracchus's servant stood patiently for a long time with his
bag of money, but no one came to him.

1577
02:15:09,479 --> 02:15:12,199
In the cafe Proximo's table was now empty.

1578
02:15:12,199 --> 02:15:13,840
He knew when to disappear.

1579
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:18,079
Maximus was brought to Proximo's room by two guards just
after sunset.

1580
02:15:18,079 --> 02:15:20,359
He was impatient, ready to start.

1581
02:15:20,359 --> 02:15:23,359
Proximo looked at Maximus and shook his head.

1582
02:15:23,399 --> 02:15:25,159
"I tried," he said.

1583
02:15:25,159 --> 02:15:30,680
"It won't work. The Emperor knows too much. And this has
become too dangerous for me."

1584
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:36,039
"Let me go," said Maximus, "and you'll be paid when I
return. I promise you."

1585
02:15:36,079 --> 02:15:39,960
"And what will happen if you don't return?" asked Proximo.

1586
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:43,239
"Trust me - I will kill Commodus," said Maximus.

1587
02:15:43,239 --> 02:15:46,439
Proximo looked hard at Maximus, studying him.

1588
02:15:46,479 --> 02:15:49,359
"I know I can trust you, General," he said.

1589
02:15:49,359 --> 02:15:57,880
"I know you would die for honor, or for Rome, or the memory of your family. I, on the other hand, am just an
entertainer." He called for his guards.

1590
02:15:57,880 --> 02:15:59,439
"Take him away."

1591
02:15:59,439 --> 02:16:02,199
Maximus looked straight into Proximo's eyes.

1592
02:16:02,199 --> 02:16:05,119
"He killed the man who freed you," he said.

1593
02:16:05,119 --> 02:16:12,079
After Maximus had gone, Proximo picked up the wooden sword
that Marcus Aurelius had given him, the sign of his freedom.

1594
02:16:12,119 --> 02:16:13,880
And he thought for a long time.

1595
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:16,039
Falco's spies were good at their job.

1596
02:16:16,039 --> 02:16:20,760
They had followed Gracchus and the other senators, then
Lucilla, and now Proximo.

1597
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:25,399
Lucilla knew their lives were in great danger and she tried
to keep her brother calm.

1598
02:16:25,399 --> 02:16:27,039
Maximus also knew it.

1599
02:16:27,039 --> 02:16:30,119
Commodus would come for him soon, he was certain.

1600
02:16:30,119 --> 02:16:35,120
In the dark of night in his prison room, he suddenly heard
footsteps coming toward him.

1601
02:16:35,159 --> 02:16:36,440
It was Proximo.

1602
02:16:36,479 --> 02:16:38,600
He woke Juba and threw him out.

1603
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:40,399
Then he turned to Maximus.

1604
02:16:40,399 --> 02:16:43,200
"Congratulations, General," he said.

1605
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:47,920
"You have very good friends." He stepped back and Lucilla
came into the room.

1606
02:16:47,959 --> 02:16:49,799
Proximo left them together.

1607
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:53,239
"My brother plans to put Gracchus in prison," she said.

1608
02:16:53,239 --> 02:17:02,120
"We can't wait any longer. You must leave tonight. Proximo will come for you at midnight and take you to a gate. Cicero
will be there with horses."

1609
02:17:02,159 --> 02:17:05,520
"You've done all this? You're very brave, Lucilla."

1610
02:17:05,559 --> 02:17:08,079
"I am tired of being brave," she said.

1611
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:11,159
"My brother hates everyone-and you most of all."

1612
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:13,319
"Because your father chose me."

1613
02:17:13,319 --> 02:17:14,840
"No," she said.

1614
02:17:14,879 --> 02:17:17,920
"Because my father loved you... and I loved you."

1615
02:17:17,959 --> 02:17:20,000
Maximus took her hands in his.

1616
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,479
"I've felt alone all my life-except with you," she said.

1617
02:17:23,479 --> 02:17:26,920
She turned to go, but Maximus held her and they kissed.

1618
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:32,600
It was their first kiss for many years, and, for a short
time, they rested in each other's arms.

1619
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:37,639
They separated, with one last look, and Lucilla went quickly
back into the dark night.

1620
02:17:37,639 --> 02:17:40,879
Back in the palace, Lucilla hurried to her son's bedroom.

1621
02:17:40,879 --> 02:17:43,559
She looked around and called to the servant.

1622
02:17:43,559 --> 02:17:45,079
"Where is Lucius?"

1623
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:48,120
"He's with the Emperor, my lady," she replied

1624
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:52,120
Lucilla rushed down the palace halls, looking in all the
rooms she passed.

1625
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:55,440
Finally, in great fear, she opened her brother's door.

1626
02:17:55,479 --> 02:17:59,280
Commodus and Lucius were sitting together, looking at some
papers.

1627
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:02,959
"Sister, come and join us," said Commodus, smiling.

1628
02:18:02,959 --> 02:18:04,360
A frightening smile.

1629
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:09,760
"I've been reading to dear Lucius about the great Julius
Caesar." He took Lucius on his knee.

1630
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:15,000
"And tomorrow, if you're very good, I'll tell you the story
of the Emperor Claudius," he said.

1631
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,440
Commodus looked right into Lucilla's eyes.

1632
02:18:17,479 --> 02:18:22,319
"He trusted the people closest to him, but they didn't
deserve his trust."

1633
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:23,840
Lucilla felt faint.

1634
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:25,600
She sat down opposite them.

1635
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:32,559
"The Emperor knew they had been very busy, planning against him," Commodus went on, watching his sister's terror all the
time.

1636
02:18:32,559 --> 02:19:59,959
"And one night he sat down with one of them and said to her, 'Tell me what you have planned, or I shall kill the person
you love the most. You will see me wash in their blood."

1637
02:19:59,959 --> 02:19:59,959
Lucilla kept her eyes on her son, and a tear ran down her
face.

1638
02:19:59,959 --> 02:19:59,959
"And the Emperor's heart was broken because she had wounded him more than anyone else could. And what do you think
happened next, Lucius?"

1639
02:19:59,959 --> 02:19:59,959
"I don't know, Uncle," said Lucius, nervously.

1640
02:19:59,959 --> 02:19:59,959
"She told him everything," Commodus said.

1641
02:19:59,959 --> 02:19:59,959
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1642
02:19:59,959 --> 02:19:59,959
Broken Plans

1643
02:19:59,959 --> 02:19:59,959
The sound of marching feet broke the silence of night in the
area around the Colosseum.

1644
02:19:59,959 --> 02:19:59,959
In his room Proximo was packing his bags, planning to leave
Rome fast.

1645
02:19:59,959 --> 02:19:59,959
He heard the marching feet coming toward the school and he
knew then how he was going to die.

1646
02:19:59,959 --> 02:19:59,959
He picked up his bunch of keys and hurried across to the
prison rooms.

1647
02:19:59,959 --> 02:19:59,959
He was almost there when the royal guards arrived and
stopped in front of his gates.

1648
02:19:59,959 --> 02:19:59,959
"Open up in the name of the Emperor!" the captain called out
loudly.

1649
02:19:59,959 --> 02:20:00,000
For a few seconds Proximo paused, without turning to look at
them.

1650
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Then he continued toward the prisons.

1651
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Maximus had also heard the marching feet and knew their
meaning exactly.

1652
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
He watched as Proximo appeared through the prison entrance,
keys in hand.

1653
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
"Everything is ready," said Proximo.

1654
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
He handed the keys to Maximus.

1655
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
"It seems you've won your freedom."

1656
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
"Proximo," said Maximus, as he took the keys, "are you in
danger of becoming a good man?"

1657
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Proximo walked back to his rooms.

1658
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
The guards could see him through the gates, but he did not
look across at them once.

1659
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
"The Emperor commands you to open these gates, Proximo!"
shouted the captain.

1660
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
"Do you want to die, old man? Tonight all enemies of the Emperor must die!" Proximo walked on, and up the stairs to
his room.

1661
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
"Break the locks!" shouted the captain.

1662
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:26,719
Maximus quickly unlocked his door.

1663
02:20:26,719 --> 02:20:29,680
Then he and Juba let Haken and the others out.

1664
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:32,680
The sound of metal hitting metal came from the gates.

1665
02:20:32,719 --> 02:20:35,159
Maximus knew he had to go, now.

1666
02:20:35,159 --> 02:20:37,479
He handed the bunch of keys to Juba.

1667
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:39,600
Juba took them, understanding.

1668
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:41,239
"Go!" he said.

1669
02:20:41,239 --> 02:20:44,959
The gates to Proximo's school flew open and the guards
rushed in.

1670
02:20:44,959 --> 02:20:47,079
Maximus ran for the back entrance.

1671
02:20:47,079 --> 02:20:54,799
Juba, Haken, and the other gladiators threw themselves between the guards and Maximus and slowed them down enough
for him to get away.

1672
02:20:54,799 --> 02:20:59,120
By the back entrance Maximus found his army sword and armor
waiting for him.

1673
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:02,879
In the fighting, Juba was knocked to the ground and left for
dead.

1674
02:21:02,879 --> 02:21:07,719
Haken was first wounded by a Roman sword and then shot
through the chest with four arrows.

1675
02:21:07,719 --> 02:21:11,120
His enormous body fell, dead, at the bottom of the stairs.

1676
02:21:11,159 --> 02:21:15,319
The guards climbed over Haken's body and raced up to
Proximo's room.

1677
02:21:15,360 --> 02:21:19,600
When they broke through the door, they found him at his desk
with his back to them.

1678
02:21:19,639 --> 02:21:24,000
In his hand was the wooden sword Marcus Aurelius had given
him with his freedom.

1679
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,079
He did not turn to see death coming.

1680
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:30,000
The end came quickly, with three deep wounds to his neck and
back.

1681
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:34,360
He died with the wooden sword hanging at his side, held
tightly in his hand.

1682
02:21:34,360 --> 02:21:39,120
Maximus came out of the back entrance to the school and
waited quietly in the shadows.

1683
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:41,280
Suddenly, he heard a horse move.

1684
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:44,680
He looked toward the sound and moved out into the street.

1685
02:21:44,719 --> 02:21:47,399
There were two horses waiting, one with a rider.

1686
02:21:47,399 --> 02:21:50,520
As he got closer, he could see that it was Cicero.

1687
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:52,200
But something felt wrong.

1688
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:55,879
Maximus hid behind some rocks and whispered Cicero's name.

1689
02:21:55,879 --> 02:21:57,040
Cicero turned.

1690
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:59,200
"Maximus!" he shouted.

1691
02:21:59,239 --> 02:22:00,280
"No!"

1692
02:22:00,319 --> 02:22:05,600
As he shouted, his horse suddenly ran and Cicero was pulled
from it by a rope around his neck.

1693
02:22:05,639 --> 02:22:07,959
He was left hanging from the tree above.

1694
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Maximus rushed forward and caught him by the legs.

1695
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:15,520
At the same time six arrows flew into Cicero's chest,
killing him immediately.

1696
02:22:15,559 --> 02:25:04,000
Maximus had his sword ready.

1697
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,959
But there were too many guards and he had no chance.

1698
02:25:06,959 --> 02:25:13,200
A voice called out, "Take him alive!" and the guards quickly
caught him, making him a prisoner again.

1699
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:19,959
At sunrise, even before their servants were awake, Senator Gaius and his wife were murdered in their bed by royal
guards.

1700
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:24,600
Seven other senators were killed the same morning, also many
private citizens.

1701
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:27,479
All these people had upset Commodus in some way.

1702
02:25:27,479 --> 02:25:29,799
His secret police had done a good job.

1703
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:46,120
Senator Gracchus was not killed, but the guards took him
away from his home and threw him into prison.

1704
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:49,680
In his room at the palace Falco came to tell Commodus the
news.

1705
02:25:49,719 --> 02:25:52,959
Commodus was pleased that so many of his enemies were
finished.

1706
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:55,879
After Falco had gone, he spoke to Lucilla.

1707
02:25:55,879 --> 02:26:00,479
"Lucius will stay with me now," he said, walking across the
room toward her.

1708
02:26:00,479 --> 02:26:10,040
"And if his mother even looks at me in a way that upsets me, he will die. If she decides to take her own life, he will
die." He smiled and touched her hair.

1709
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:12,280
"Kiss me, sister," he said.

1710
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:14,680
It was hot and dusty in the Colosseum.

1711
02:26:14,719 --> 02:26:19,360
Hundreds of servants at the top of the arena were throwing
red flowers down onto the sand.

1712
02:26:19,360 --> 02:26:21,840
Fifty-five thousand Romans were waiting.

1713
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:24,639
They had been told to expect something special.

1714
02:26:24,639 --> 02:26:26,559
Maximus was also waiting.

1715
02:26:26,559 --> 02:26:28,879
He knew there was only death ahead of him.

1716
02:26:28,879 --> 02:26:33,959
But he still hoped for a soldier's death, and he kept his
back straight and his head up.

1717
02:26:33,959 --> 02:26:38,959
On his way to the arena he passed a prison room where Juba
and Proximo's other gladiators were.

1718
02:26:38,959 --> 02:26:43,639
When he saw Maximus, Juba stood in a silent salute to a
brave man and a friend.

1719
02:26:43,639 --> 02:26:48,600
Under the floor of the Colosseum arena was a large elevator,
operated by servants with ropes.

1720
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:52,680
It was the way the tigers had entered the arena when Maximus
fought Tigris.

1721
02:26:52,719 --> 02:26:56,159
Maximus was led there now by Quintus and the royal guards.

1722
02:26:56,159 --> 02:27:00,440
They fastened his chains to the elevator and Quintus himself
checked them.

1723
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:05,000
As he bent to do this he whispered softly, "I'm a soldier. I
obey."

1724
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,120
Someone was walking toward them.

1725
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:43,360
Quintus stood up again and moved back.

1726
02:27:43,399 --> 02:27:47,200
Emperor Commodus suddenly appeared with a group of servants
carrying armor.

1727
02:27:47,239 --> 02:27:50,120
The Emperor himself was wearing his own gold armor.

1728
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:53,079
He wore this armor when he wanted to feel like a god.

1729
02:27:53,079 --> 02:27:56,639
Commodus and six of his guards joined Maximus on the
elevator.

1730
02:27:56,680 --> 02:28:00,799
Maximus expected to die immediately, but Commodus smiled at
him.

1731
02:28:00,799 --> 02:28:03,079
"Listen to the crowd," he said.

1732
02:28:03,079 --> 02:28:13,639
"They are calling for you. The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who insulted
an emperor." He called his servants forward with the armor.

1733
02:28:13,639 --> 02:28:15,520
"It's a good story" he said.

1734
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:21,959
"And now the people want to know how the story ends. Only a
great death will be good enough," Commodus continued.

1735
02:28:21,959 --> 02:28:26,399
"And what could be better than to fight the Emperor himself
in the greatest arena?"

1736
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:28,239
Maximus did not believe him.

1737
02:28:28,239 --> 02:28:29,879
"You will fight me?"

1738
02:28:29,879 --> 02:28:32,000
"Why not?" Commodus said.

1739
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,920
"Do you think I'm afraid?"

1740
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:39,799
The servants began to fix armor to Maximus's body, first his
arms, legs, and shoulders.

1741
02:28:39,799 --> 02:28:41,959
They left the body armor until last.

1742
02:28:41,959 --> 02:28:45,559
"I think you've been afraid all your life," Maximus
answered.

1743
02:28:45,559 --> 02:28:48,520
He knew Commodus would never have a fair fight with him.

1744
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:50,680
What would he do to make sure he won?

1745
02:28:50,680 --> 02:28:54,879
"Unlike Maximus the Brave, who knows no fear?" said
Commodus.

1746
02:28:54,879 --> 02:29:02,479
"I've been afraid, But you took away from me everything I loved. Since then, you're right, I have not known fear,"
said Maximus.

1747
02:29:02,479 --> 02:29:06,520
"There is one thing left-you still have your life to lose,"
said Commodus.

1748
02:29:06,559 --> 02:29:59,959
"I once knew a man who said, 'Death smiles at us all. A man
can only smile back,'" said Maximus.

1749
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
"I wonder," said Commodus, "did your friend smile at his own
death?"

1750
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
"You must know," Maximus replied.

1751
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
"He was your father."

1752
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
Commodus was silent, and they stared at each other.

1753
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
"You loved my father, I know," Commodus said.

1754
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
"But I did, too. That makes us brothers, doesn't it?" He
reached out his arms to Maximus and put them around him.

1755
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
Maximus suddenly let out a cry of pain.

1756
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
The Emperor had a small, sharp knife in his hand.

1757
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
He had wounded Maximus in the side, cutting him deeply.

1758
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
"Smile for me now, brother," Commodus said, as he pulled the
knife out.

1759
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
Quintus stared, shocked.

1760
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
"Now put on his body armor. Hide the wound," Commodus said
to his servants.

1761
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
All eyes in the Colosseum watched the center of the arena as
the elevator came up.

1762
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
Commodus stepped off and onto the sand.

1763
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
It was covered with red flowers.

1764
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
Commodus took his sword from Quintus and turned slowly to
all sides of the arena.

1765
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
Maximus stood straight, but he was in great pain.

1766
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
He looked up to the royal seats and saw Lucilla there with
Lucius and Senator Gracchus.

1767
02:29:59,959 --> 02:29:59,959
They were surrounded by guards.

1768
02:29:59,959 --> 02:30:00,000
Commodus raised his sword high and the sun shone off it.

1769
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Maximus slowly bent down and picked up some sand from the
arena.

1770
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Quintus threw Maximus's sword down on the ground near his
feet.

1771
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Maximus picked it up, slowly, and stood facing the Emperor.

1772
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
And the fight began.

1773
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Commodus rushed at Maximus and knocked him to the ground.

1774
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Maximus got to his feet with difficulty.

1775
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
The arena seemed to be turning around.

1776
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
The sun danced off the Emperor's armor and blinded him.

1777
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
He heard the noise of the crowd-now it seemed to be far
away, now close.

1778
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Standing behind the entrance, Juba saw a thin line of blood
running out from under Maximus's armor.

1779
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Lucilla watched him in fear.

1780
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
He seemed to be looking straight at her.

1781
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Could he see her?

1782
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
She held out her hand and called his name.

1783
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Commodus struck him again.

1784
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Then he raised his arms to the crowd.

1785
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
One or two people shouted, "Commodus!" The crowd loved a
winner.

1786
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Maximus almost fell again.

1787
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
The sun was bright, very bright.

1788
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
And then suddenly, beyond all this, he saw the sun shining
on a pink wall...

1789
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
He saw a gate in the wall... and a field of apple trees
beyond it...

1790
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
He pushed himself forward and, as he did so, he struck
Commodus.

1791
02:30:00,000 --> 02:32:12,239
The crowd cheered.

1792
02:32:12,280 --> 02:32:16,079
Commodus came forward again and knocked Maximus back to the
ground.

1793
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:17,600
The crowd were silent.

1794
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:20,120
Only the sound of the two men could be heard.

1795
02:32:20,120 --> 02:32:22,120
Maximus saw something else now...

1796
02:32:22,120 --> 02:32:24,760
A woman stood in the doorway of a pink stone house...

1797
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:27,120
There was a field of wheat behind the house...

1798
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:30,440
Commodus stood over Maximus with his sword ready for the
kill.

1799
02:32:30,479 --> 02:32:34,440
"Maximus!" One person in the crowd called out in the
silence.

1800
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:36,600
Commodus looked around, angrily.

1801
02:32:36,600 --> 02:32:38,440
The crowd repeated the cry.

1802
02:32:38,440 --> 02:32:42,479
"Maximus!" Commodus turned back and brought his sword down.

1803
02:32:42,479 --> 02:32:47,479
But the sound of the crowd had brought Maximus back to the
arena and given him new strength.

1804
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:50,879
He pushed his sword up and knocked Commodus's sword away.

1805
02:32:50,879 --> 02:32:55,040
Suddenly he got to his feet and attacked the Emperor,
forcing him back.

1806
02:32:55,079 --> 02:32:56,639
The crowd cheered loudly.

1807
02:32:56,680 --> 02:33:00,319
Then Maximus saw an opportunity and pushed his sword
forward.

1808
02:33:00,319 --> 02:33:03,719
It caught Commodus under his arm and he dropped his sword.

1809
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:05,600
Commodus called to Quintus.

1810
02:33:05,639 --> 02:33:07,319
"Give me your sword!"

1811
02:33:07,319 --> 02:33:09,520
But Quintus just stared through him.

1812
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:11,360
Commodus turned to the guards.

1813
02:33:11,399 --> 02:33:13,799
"A sword! Give me a sword!"

1814
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:17,319
Some started to come forward, but Quintus stopped them.

1815
02:33:17,319 --> 02:33:20,000
"Put your swords away!" he ordered.

1816
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,639
Commodus looked around, suddenly frightened.

1817
02:33:22,639 --> 02:33:26,520
He saw the great crowd and heard the name of his enemy on
all sides.

1818
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:30,680
"Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!" they shouted.

1819
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:32,399
Senators joined in the cry.

1820
02:33:32,399 --> 02:33:35,360
Juba and the gladiators shouted the name, too.

1821
02:33:35,440 --> 02:33:38,319
Lucilla stood in silence, her hand to her mouth.

1822
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:39,959
But Maximus was dying.

1823
02:33:39,959 --> 02:33:41,280
He could not stand.

1824
02:33:41,319 --> 02:33:42,959
He dropped his own sword.

1825
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:50,040
He seemed to be reaching out toward something... a pink stone wall with a gate... a wheat field... the sound of a
child's laugh...

1826
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:53,760
Commodus saw Maximus fall to his knees and he stood over
him.

1827
02:33:53,799 --> 02:33:59,440
He took the small knife in his hand again and lifted it,
ready to strike Maximus one last time.

1828
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:01,959
Maximus saw the knife coming toward him.

1829
02:34:01,959 --> 02:34:05,200
He held Commodus's arm and pulled him onto the ground.

1830
02:34:05,239 --> 02:34:11,319
Suddenly finding power from somewhere, Maximus turned the
knife around and pushed it deep into Commodus's neck.

1831
02:34:11,319 --> 02:34:16,200
There was a look of surprise on the Emperor's face, then he
took one last breath and died.

1832
02:34:16,239 --> 02:34:20,600
Maximus slowly stood, took one step forward, and reached out
a hand.

1833
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:22,159
Quintus went to him.

1834
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:23,559
"Maximus..."

1835
02:34:23,559 --> 02:34:26,520
"Quintus, free my men," said Maximus.

1836
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:28,559
The crowd was completely quiet.

1837
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:31,879
Maximus saw his own hand on the gate, pushing it open...

1838
02:34:31,959 --> 02:34:35,040
Walking away from him was a woman, and a child running...

1839
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:37,280
They looked back and smiled at him...

1840
02:34:37,319 --> 02:34:39,079
Maximus fell to the sand.

1841
02:34:39,079 --> 02:34:43,079
Out of the silence, Lucilla crossed the arena to the place
where he lay.

1842
02:34:43,079 --> 02:34:44,719
She took him in her arms.

1843
02:34:44,719 --> 02:34:49,559
She could see that she could not save him, but she wanted
him to hear her before the end.

1844
02:34:49,559 --> 02:34:52,000
"Maximus," Lucilla said softly.

1845
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,239
Maximus's dying eyes opened again.

1846
02:34:54,239 --> 02:34:56,559
"Lucius is safe?" he asked.

1847
02:34:56,600 --> 02:34:57,639
"Yes."

1848
02:34:57,639 --> 02:34:59,280
"Our sons live."

1849
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:00,479
Lucilla smiled.

1850
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:07,719
"Our sons live. And they are proud." She kissed him, crying,
and whispered, "Go to them. You're home."

1851
02:35:07,719 --> 02:35:09,840
Maximus walked through the wheat field...

1852
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:12,239
The beautiful woman stopped and turned.

1853
02:35:12,280 --> 02:35:13,719
She called to the boy.

1854
02:35:13,760 --> 02:35:15,920
He stopped running and looked back.

1855
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:23,399
The boy then started running back along the road, toward the man in the wheat field, toward his father, who was coming
home at last.

1856
02:35:23,399 --> 02:35:27,600
Maximus died in Lucilla's arms, as she placed him gently on
the sand.

1857
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:30,520
When she stood up, the whole arena was watching her.

1858
02:35:30,559 --> 02:35:32,840
She turned and spoke to the senators.

1859
02:35:32,840 --> 02:35:35,079
"Rome is free again," she said.

1860
02:35:35,079 --> 02:35:40,000
Lucilla stood over Maximus's body as Gracchus and the
senators came down onto the sand.

1861
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,680
"He was a soldier of Rome," Lucilla said.

1862
02:35:42,680 --> 02:35:43,879
"Honor him."

1863
02:35:43,879 --> 02:35:47,159
Quintus's voice rang out, "Free the prisoners!"

1864
02:35:47,159 --> 02:35:52,360
A hand turned a key, and Juba led the last of Proximo's
gladiators into the silent arena.

1865
02:35:52,399 --> 02:35:54,040
Gracchus stood by the body.

1866
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:56,440
"Who will help me carry this man?"

1867
02:35:56,440 --> 02:36:00,040
A few voices broke the silence, calling Maximus's name.

1868
02:36:00,079 --> 02:36:02,040
Then many more voices joined in.

1869
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:04,239
The sound grew and filled the arena.

1870
02:36:04,239 --> 02:36:07,239
The gladiators picked Maximus up on their shoulders.

1871
02:36:07,239 --> 02:36:13,239
Silent and proud, following Gracchus and the other senators
in a slow march, they carried him out of the arena.

1872
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:19,319
Lucilla stood for a long time, watching them go, while her
mad brother lay dead on the bloody sand behind her.

1873
02:36:19,319 --> 02:36:20,520
CHAPTER TWELVE

1874
02:36:20,520 --> 02:38:28,079
Home, At Last

1875
02:38:28,120 --> 02:38:29,559
The games had ended.

1876
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:33,639
The Colosseum was empty and silent as Juba walked across the
sand.

1877
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:37,479
Juba, now dressed in his African clothes, was a free man
again.

1878
02:38:37,520 --> 02:38:39,399
And soon he was going home.

1879
02:38:39,399 --> 02:38:42,040
He still heard one voice in the arena, though.

1880
02:38:42,040 --> 02:38:48,799
He heard Maximus, the great fighter, asking about his home
in Africa and talking to him about his own home in Spain.

1881
02:38:48,799 --> 02:38:55,399
Juba moved to the center of the arena and found the exact
place he was looking for: a small area of blood on the sand.

1882
02:38:55,399 --> 02:38:58,639
He dropped to his knees and made a little hole in the
ground.

1883
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:03,600
He took something from his pocket-the small wooden figures
of Maximus's wife and son.

1884
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:08,559
He carefully put them in the hole and covered them with the
earth that carried their loved one's blood.

1885
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:12,200
Now it would be easier for them to find each other in the
next world.

1886
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:17,079
"Now we are free," he said loudly, looking around at the
empty, silent arena.

1887
02:39:17,079 --> 02:39:20,639
"This place will become dust, but I will not forget you."

1888
02:39:20,680 --> 02:39:23,559
He stood above the place where Maximus had died.

1889
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:26,399
"I will see you again," he said to his friend.

1890
02:39:26,399 --> 02:39:33,040
He smiled the wide smile that he had smiled for Maximus in
life and would soon smile for his own wife and daughters.

1891
02:39:33,079 --> 02:39:34,479
"But not yet."

1892
02:39:34,479 --> 02:39:41,479
He walked slowly out of the arena, looking back just once at the place, as the wind blew red flowers across the killing
ground.
