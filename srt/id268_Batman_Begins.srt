00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,720
The Blue Flower

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,200
Bruce Wayne was in prison in Bhutan, a country far away from
his home in Gotham City in America.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,280
One day, he was waiting for breakfast with all the other
prisoners.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,880
They stood in lines.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,440
After a long time, Bruce got his plate of horrible food.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,920
He took the plate and walked to a table.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,320
A very big man stood in front of him.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,880
"Give me your food," said the man.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,720
"No," Bruce said.

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,880
The man hit Bruce in the face.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,480
Bruce dropped his plate and fell to the floor.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,840
When he got up, there were seven big men in front of him.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,080
Two of them took Bruce by the arms.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,200
He used his legs - hard - and they fell.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,320
Then - CRRAAACCCCK!

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,880
At the sound of the gun, all the prisoners quickly got down
on the floor.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,800
A prison officer took Bruce's arm.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,520
"You're coming with me," he said.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,360
"Why?" asked Bruce.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,240
"So I'm safe?"

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,800
"No," said the officer.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,000
"So they're safe!"

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,960
The officer pushed Bruce into a room and closed the door
with a bang.

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,000
It was very dark in the room, but Bruce saw that he was not
alone.

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,360
There was a man in the corner.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,120
He didn't look like a prisoner.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,320
He wore good clothes.

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,560
"My name is Ducard," he said.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,480
"I work for Ra's al Ghul. Do you know him?"

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,200
"Is he a criminal?" Bruce asked.

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,320
"He is not a criminal," said Ducard.

33
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:06,640
"He is a great man with very clever ideas. He knows that
you're in trouble, Mr Wayne. He wants to help you."

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,480
Ducard walked to the door and shouted.

35
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,160
The officer came and opened it.

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,840
Ducard turned to Bruce.

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,320
"There is a very special flower," he said.

38
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:32,920
"It grows on the mountain near here. It's blue. Find it and take it to the top of the mountain. There you will find the
answer to your question."

39
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,160
"And what is my question?" asked Bruce.

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,040
"Where am I going?" said Ducard.

41
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,720
And he left.

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:52,000
"Why is Ducard interested in me? How does he know about me?"
Bruce asked himself.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,480
He sat on the hard bed and began to think about his life.

44
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,840
He remembered that terrible day in Gotham many years ago.

45
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,400
He is a little boy.

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,440
He is playing with his friend, Rachel.

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,120
They are running in the garden at his home, Wayne Manor.

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,160
There is an old well in the garden.

49
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,960
Bruce climbs onto the well and laughs.

50
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,240
"Look at me, Rachel, I'm-"

51
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,800
Suddenly he isn't laughing.

52
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,280
He's shouting.

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,080
"Help! Help! I'm falling-"

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,440
And he falls down and down and down into the dark well.

55
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,200
He hits the floor with a bang!

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,160
"Agh! My leg!" he cries.

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,240
It feels terrible.

58
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,640
Then he hears some strange sounds.

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,040
He isn't alone in the well!

60
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,520
Help!

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,440
What is it?

62
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,440
He looks up and sees a cloud of terrible black things.

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,760
Bats!

64
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,320
They are flying towards him and into him.

65
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,160
Their teeth are like knives.

66
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,520
He thinks he is going to die.

67
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,320
He makes himself into a ball and shouts.

68
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,560
"Help! Help!" Then everything goes black.

69
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,000
The next thing he remembers... he is in bed.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,680
The only person in the bedroom with him is Alfred.

71
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,320
Alfred has always worked for the Wayne family.

72
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,200
"You had a very bad fall, Master Bruce," says Alfred.

73
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:54,520
"But you're going to be OK." Alfred waits for a moment, then
he asks, "Why do we fall, Master Bruce?"

74
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,880
Bruce knows the answer, but he can't remember it.

75
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,880
"I can't remember," says Bruce.

76
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,840
"Tell me."

77
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:12,080
"We fall," says Alfred with a smile, "so that we can learn
to get up again."

78
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Bruce started to climb the mountain.

79
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,200
He found the blue flower easily.

80
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,240
He climbed higher.

81
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,880
Up and up he went.

82
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,520
It got colder and colder.

83
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Soon he was walking on ice.

84
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,440
It started to snow heavily.

85
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,600
Bruce was cold and unhappy.

86
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
And very tired.

87
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,040
"I have to get to the top," he thought, "but I don't know if
I can."

88
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,080
Then at last he saw a big building.

89
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,920
He pushed open the heavy door and went in.

90
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,080
Ra's al Ghul was sitting in a big chair.

91
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,880
Ducard was next to him.

92
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,520
And there was a line of Ninjas with swords in their hands...
ready to fight.

93
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,320
Bruce was frightened.

94
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,200
He quickly showed them the blue flower in his hand.

95
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,880
Ducard took the flower.

96
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,160
"Are you ready to start?" he asked.

97
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,280
"Ready? Oh no," Bruce said, "I'm so tired."

98
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,560
Ducard threw him to the floor.

99
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,360
"You must always be ready," he said.

100
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,840
"Here we will teach you to be ready."

101
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:51,880
One day, Ducard said to Bruce, "You're not frightened of me,
are you, Bruce? What are you frightened of?"

102
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,640
"Bats," answered Bruce, and he told Ducard about the bats in
the well.

103
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:17,440
"My father told me something important about the bats in the well." He said, "The bats flew at you because they were
frightened of you. All things are frightened of something, even scary things like bats." I didn't know that.

104
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,880
My father was very clever.

105
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,200
I loved him very much.

106
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,280
But soon after that, he died.

107
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,800
A criminal killed both my parents.

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,560
His name was Joe Chill."

109
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,320
It's the evening.

110
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,240
They are at a play.

111
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,560
Suddenly there are bats in the show.

112
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,120
They fly around above the singers and dancers.

113
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,800
Bruce is frightened, so they leave early.

114
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,880
But in the street outside, there is a man with a gun.

115
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,800
He wants money.

116
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,320
He takes their money but he wants more.

117
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,720
And then - BANG! - he fires his gun.

118
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,040
Bruce's mother shouts.

119
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,960
Bruce's father falls to the floor.

120
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,080
BANG!

121
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,520
He fires again.

122
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,600
Bruce's mother falls to the floor.

123
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,600
This is the worst moment of Bruce's life.

124
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,520
And it is all his fault.

125
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,880
"It wasn't your fault, Bruce," said Ducard.

126
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,480
"You were very young."

127
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,360
He was giving Bruce a lesson on a river.

128
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,800
It was thick ice.

129
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,360
They were fighting with swords.

130
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,480
"You must always look very carefully at the things around
you, Bruce," said Ducard.

131
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,400
Suddenly he hit the ice with his sword.

132
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,800
CRRAAACCCCK!

133
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,440
The ice broke and Bruce crashed into the black water below.

134
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,920
Bruce had lessons with Ducard for many months.

135
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,160
He learned to fight with his hands and his feet.

136
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,120
He learned to fight with a sword and climb tall buildings
quickly and quietly.

137
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,400
He learned many things.

138
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:20,040
But most of all he learned to use his ears and eyes, and he
learned how to think quickly.

139
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,160
"It's time to test you," said Ducard one day.

140
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,480
"Today you must fight all the Ninjas."

141
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,880
So Bruce fought all the Ninjas with his sword.

142
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,920
It was a very long fight, but in the end he won.

143
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,240
"You fight very well now," said Ducard.

144
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,800
"I think you are ready."

145
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:55,160
CHAPTER TWO

146
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,640
Bats Everywhere

147
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,920
Bruce couldn't sleep that night.

148
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,600
He remembered his life after Joe Chill killed his parents.

149
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,280
He was so unhappy and so angry.

150
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,640
He went from school to school and university to university.

151
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,680
He never stayed long in one place.

152
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,760
Bruce is twenty.

153
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,080
He is going back to Gotham by train.

154
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,960
Alfred meets him at the station.

155
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,760
On the way to Wayne Manor he sees that everything is
different.

156
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,920
Everywhere is dirty.

157
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,440
Many houses are empty.

158
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,200
Many shops are closed.

159
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,760
People are sleeping on the streets.

160
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,040
"Things are very bad in Gotham now, Master Bruce," Alfred
tells him.

161
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:57,640
"But Wayne Manor is still your home. Your father was a great
man, and one day you will be a great man too."

162
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,520
It is the afternoon on the same day.

163
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,000
Bruce is sitting on his bed.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,560
"Joe Chill will be free today," he thinks.

165
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:18,680
"He killed my parents twelve years ago. And today I'm going
to kill him." He takes a gun out of his bag.

166
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,680
His old friend, Rachel, comes to the house.

167
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,280
She is an Assistant District Attorney - an important lawyer
in Gotham now.

168
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,200
"Wow!" he thinks when he sees her.

169
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,680
"She is so beautiful." They drive to the prison.

170
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,080
"Why are they freeing Joe Chill today?" he asks.

171
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:51,200
"When he was in prison, he was in a room with Carmine
Falcone, the famous criminal," Rachel explains.

172
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:59,080
"They talked and he learned lots of things about Falcone.
He's going to give that information to the police."

173
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,760
They arrive outside the prison.

174
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,400
The newspaper people are waiting.

175
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,080
Joe Chill comes out.

176
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,000
There are police all around him.

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,840
Bruce gets out of Rachel's car and walks towards Chill.

178
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,720
He has his hand in his pocket... on his gun.

179
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,640
But - suddenly - a blonde woman pushes through the people.

180
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,800
She runs up to Chill.

181
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,120
She has a gun in her hand.

182
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,120
"Falcone says "Hi, Joe"," she shouts.

183
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,640
BANG!

184
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,480
BANG!

185
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,280
She kills Joe Chill.

186
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,240
Joe Chill was dead.

187
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,800
But Bruce didn't feel better.

188
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,040
It wasn't the answer.

189
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,600
Ducard took Bruce's blue flower.

190
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,280
He pulled the dry flower into little pieces and made a small
fire with it.

191
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:07,160
"Smell your flower now," he said to Bruce.

192
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,040
Bruce put his nose near the smoke.

193
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,680
The smell was terrible.

194
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,480
He suddenly started to remember the worst days of his
life...

195
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
He was falling down the well...

196
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,400
He was seeing his parents" blood in the street...

197
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,040
"You are frightened of these things.

198
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,280
Look at them.

199
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,520
Fight them.

200
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,680
Now!" said Ducard.

201
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,160
He pointed to a large wooden box. Bruce opened it.

202
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,560
WHOOOOSSSH!

203
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:46,640
Hundreds of bats flew out of the box. Bruce wanted to shout
and run. But he didn't.

204
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,760
"No," he thought, "I must be strong."

205
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,360
He stood there quietly.

206
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,000
He didn't move.

207
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,320
He didn't say a word.

208
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,720
"Well done!" said Ra's al Ghul.

209
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,840
"You are not frightened now. You are ready to join my
Ninjas."

210
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,480
He gave Bruce a light.

211
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,960
"Take this light and give your life to me."

212
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,520
Bruce took the light.

213
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,440
"Where must I go with your men?" he asked.

214
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,320
"To Gotham," answered Ra's al Ghul.

215
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,880
"Gotham must die. You must kill all the people there."

216
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,960
"No!" shouted Bruce.

217
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,040
This could not be real.

218
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,000
"We have taught you many things," said Ra's al Ghul.

219
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,080
"Now you must do this for us."

220
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,960
"I won't do it!" shouted Bruce.

221
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,960
He threw the light on the wooden floor.

222
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,080
It broke.

223
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,160
A fire started and moved quickly around the room.

224
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,320
It grew and grew.

225
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,400
It reached the boxes of explosives in the cupboards.

226
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,640
They started to explode.

227
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,960
BANG!

228
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,320
BANG!

229
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,680
Ninjas ran everywhere.

230
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,000
The roof started to fall.

231
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,240
It fell on Ra's al Ghul and killed him.

232
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,560
As Bruce ran to the door, he saw Ducard's body on the floor.

233
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,400
He wasn't dead.

234
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,120
Bruce pulled Ducard out of the building and into the snow.

235
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,120
He pulled him down the icy mountain.

236
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,520
Ducard was very heavy.

237
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,320
Once he almost fell over the edge of the mountain, but Bruce
saved him.

238
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,920
After some time they came to some houses.

239
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,880
Bruce left Ducard with an old man there.

240
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,880
"You saved his life. I will tell him," said the old man.

241
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,160
"Where are you going?"

242
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,640
"I'm going home," said Bruce.

243
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,440
Bruce walked down the rest of the mountain.

244
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,360
He phoned Alfred.

245
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,760
"I need you, Alfred," he said.

246
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,320
"Please come and get me."

247
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,200
Alfred flew to Bhutan in the Wayne family plane and took
Bruce back to Gotham.

248
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,720
He told Bruce all about the terrible changes in Gotham.

249
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Carmine Falcone was the crime boss in the city now.

250
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,080
Everyone was frightened of him.

251
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:39,320
And William Earle sat in Bruce's father's chair at Wayne
Enterprises, the Wayne family business in Wayne Tower.

252
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,120
"Bruce Wayne is dead," Earle told everyone.

253
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,280
"I'm the boss now."

254
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,520
Bruce listened carefully to Alfred.

255
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,240
"I'm going to save Gotham, Alfred," he said.

256
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:02,880
When they arrived home at Wayne Manor, Bruce saw a small
black thing high on the wall.

257
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,120
"What's that, Alfred?" he asked.

258
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,160
"It's a bat, sir," answered Alfred.

259
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,000
"There are lots of bats around here."

260
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,480
Bruce suddenly ran out of the house.

261
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,080
He ran to the well in the garden and climbed down and down.

262
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,000
He reached the floor.

263
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,040
It was very dark but he could feel a cold wind.

264
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,320
He found a hole in the wall and climbed through.

265
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
He could hear water.

266
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,640
It was quite near.

267
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:43,280
He followed the black walls until they opened into a big
cave.

268
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,240
A river ran through the cave.

269
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:52,560
And everywhere there were bats - hundreds and hundreds of
bats.

270
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,840
Bruce smiled.

271
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:02,360
The next morning Bruce put on a new suit and went to Wayne
Tower.

272
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,400
The woman at the front desk at Wayne Enterprises tried to
stop him.

273
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,320
"You can't go in there," she said.

274
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,680
"They're having a business meeting."

275
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,480
But Bruce opened the door and went in.

276
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,520
There were a lot of men sitting around a long table.

277
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,080
And at the end of the table was William Earle.

278
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,880
"Good morning, Mr Earle. Good morning, everyone," said
Bruce.

279
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,280
Earle's face went white but he quickly tried to smile.

280
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,960
"My boy! How nice to see you!" he said.

281
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,760
"You're back. What a surprise! A nice surprise!"

282
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,600
"I've come back to work here," said Bruce.

283
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,400
"I want to learn the family business."

284
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,360
Bruce started work in the Applied Sciences office.

285
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:07,240
This was the new ideas office, but Wayne Enterprises didn't
seem to be very interested in new ideas these days.

286
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,880
The only other person in the office was Lucius Fox.

287
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,400
Lucius was a friend of Bruce's father, before he died.

288
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,520
Bruce looked around the big room.

289
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,080
It was full of strange and exciting things.

290
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,200
"What's this?" he asked, and pointed to a black suit.

291
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,600
"It's a body suit," said Lucius.

292
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,880
"It can stop a knife. It can even stop a gun."

293
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,160
"Can I have it?" asked Bruce.

294
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,200
"Of course," said Lucius.

295
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,000
"All these things are yours anyway."

296
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,320
Bruce took the body suit home and down to the cave.

297
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,600
"Soon," he thought, "I will be ready."

298
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:02,760
CHAPTER THREE

299
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,880
A Man of the Night

300
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,720
The night his parents died, Bruce waited a long time at the
police station.

301
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,360
One of the police officers there was very kind to him.

302
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,800
His name was Sergeant James Gordon.

303
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,200
Bruce knew that he was a good police officer.

304
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,480
He wanted to talk to Gordon now.

305
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,000
But he didn't go as Bruce.

306
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,320
He put on his black body suit and a mask.

307
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,400
When Batman appeared in Gordon's office, the sergeant was
surprised and frightened.

308
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,080
"Who are you?" he asked.

309
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,800
"What do you want?"

310
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,320
"Don't be frightened, Sergeant Gordon," said Batman.

311
00:20:46,320 --> 00:21:02,080
"I need your help. I know Carmine Falcone is the biggest criminal in Gotham. Why is everyone frightened of him? Why
does no one stop him?"

312
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,560
"Because..." said Gordon, "he pays all the important people
in Gotham!"

313
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,200
Bruce went to the river for the first time in many years.

314
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,600
There were lots of people there.

315
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,560
They didn't have homes.

316
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,320
They slept in the streets every night.

317
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,720
Some people were standing around a fire.

318
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,400
Bruce stood with them and warmed his hands.

319
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,160
He looked across the street and pointed to a door.

320
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,840
"Is that Carmine Falcone's club?" he asked.

321
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,720
"Yeah," someone said.

322
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:49,040
The next day at work, Lucius Fox said, "Come with me, Mr
Wayne. I want to show you something."

323
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,240
Bruce followed him into a big room.

324
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,960
There, in the centre of the room, was a fantastic car.

325
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:05,960
A few moments later, they were in the car and Bruce was
driving it faster and faster along the road.

326
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,360
"Go slower, Mr Wayne!" shouted Lucius.

327
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,440
"No way!" shouted Bruce.

328
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:21,560
"This is fantastic! This isn't an ordinary car. It's more
like a plane. Can I have it?"

329
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,440
"Of course," shouted Lucius.

330
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,640
"All these things are yours anyway!"

331
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,920
Later Bruce drove the car back to Wayne Manor.

332
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,680
I'll call it the Batmobile," he told Alfred.

333
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:43,200
Bruce was a man of the night now. He was Batman.

334
00:22:43,240 --> 00:23:08,680
He stood on top of a building near Falcone's club. He watched the street by the river. He saw a police officer
talking to a group of ship workers. The officer took out a small white bag and gave it to the workers. Drugs! So some of the Gotham police were bad too. Falcone was paying everyone.

335
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:18,320
Falcone sat in his office with Dr Crane, the boss of Arkham
Asylum for the mentally ill.

336
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:30,800
"Our boss is arriving very soon," said Crane. "When I tell
him about the money - his money - he won't be happy."

337
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,000
"Don't tell him," said Falcone.

338
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,760
"I won't take any more. This is the last time."

339
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,320
He gave Crane a small bag.

340
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,840
"Do you want to test the drugs now?" he asked.

341
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,920
Suddenly there was a loud bang and the sound of guns.

342
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,520
Crane quickly escaped through the door.

343
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,840
Batman flew into the room.

344
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,120
"What are you?" asked Falcone.

345
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,240
"I'm Batman. Everything changes tonight."

346
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,400
Batman crossed the city to Rachel's house.

347
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,160
He climbed through her bedroom window.

348
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,920
"Rachel, wake up!" he said.

349
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:29,640
"I want to tell you something. Everything changes tonight!"

350
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,120
"And who are you?"

351
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:42,680
"A friend. I want to do good, like you. I want to fight the
bad people of Gotham."

352
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,160
Sergeant Gordon arrived at the river.

353
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,560
A lot of newspaper people were there.

354
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,600
They were taking photos.

355
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,320
Next to a ship there was a large box full of small bags of
drugs.

356
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,280
Falcone's men were lying behind the box.

357
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,000
"Fantastic!" said Gordon.

358
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,400
"Where's Falcone? He always escapes trouble."

359
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,360
"Not this time. Look. He's over there," someone said.

360
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,280
Gordon looked.

361
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,160
There was a big light next to the river.

362
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,480
A man was lying across the light.

363
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,480
He wasn't moving.

364
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,600
It was Falcone.

365
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:36,120
Rachel read the newspaper the next day and saw the photo of
Falcone on the front page.

366
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,720
She smiled.

367
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:44,240
At the police station, Sergeant Gordon's boss was very
angry.

368
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,640
"Who did this to Falcone?" he shouted.

369
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,640
"Find him fast! The police look stupid because of him."

370
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,320
"I think he's trying to help us, sir," Gordon said.

371
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,960
"We don't need his help!" shouted his boss.

372
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,240
"Well, I think we probably do," thought Gordon.

373
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,240
But he didn't say anything.

374
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,160
Dr Crane was visiting Falcone at the police station.

375
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:26,360
"Tell the police I'm mentally ill," Falcone said to him, "or
I'll tell them about you and the drugs."

376
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,440
Crane was angry.

377
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,120
"What do you know about me and the drugs?" he asked.

378
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,640
"I know that you test them on people in your hospital," said
Falcone.

379
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,240
"I know the boss is planning something big."

380
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,440
"Would you like to see my mask?" said Dr Crane suddenly.

381
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:57,280
"I use it in my tests. People are very frightened of it.
They don't like it at all."

382
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,920
He opened his bag and took out a horrible mask.

383
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,480
He put it on.

384
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,800
"How do I look?"

385
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,520
WHOOOOSSSH!!

386
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,240
Suddenly white smoke came out of his bag.

387
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,160
Falcone tried to shout but his nose and his mouth were on
fire.

388
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,360
Water came out of his eyes.

389
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,680
He saw horrible things in front of his eyes.

390
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,280
Crane quickly put the mask back in his bag and shut it.

391
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,360
He called a police officer.

392
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:34,560
"I think Mr Falcone is certainly mentally ill," he said to
the officer.

393
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:41,280
"We'll move Mr Falcone to Arkham Asylum. We can take care of
him there."

394
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Earle was angry.

395
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,400
Bruce Wayne was back in Gotham.

396
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,640
Earle wanted to sell Wayne Enterprises for a lot of money,
but now he couldn't.

397
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,120
And now he had another problem.

398
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,080
His Number 2 at Wayne Enterprises, Rogers, was telling him
about it.

399
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,880
"One of our biggest ships has disappeared," said Rogers.

400
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,520
"There's a big, expensive machine on that ship," said Earle.

401
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,520
"A very dangerous machine that can change water into steam."

402
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:25,520
CHAPTER FOUR

403
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,120
The White Smoke

404
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,600
"No one must know that I am Batman," thought Bruce.

405
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,480
"Everyone must think that I am just rich and lazy."

406
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:44,520
So one evening, Bruce went to have dinner at Gotham's most
expensive hotel restaurant.

407
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,120
He took two beautiful women with him, one on each arm.

408
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,240
After dinner, the women wanted to swim in the hotel swimming
pool.

409
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,400
"It's closed," said the waiter.

410
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:03,720
"Then I will buy this hotel and open the swimming pool!"
said Bruce.

411
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,840
He jumped into the pool with the two women.

412
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,920
Later, when Bruce was leaving the hotel with the two women,
he suddenly saw Rachel.

413
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,640
She wore a fantastic dress and looked beautiful.

414
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,440
She was just going into the restaurant.

415
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,080
"You haven't changed much, have you, Bruce?" she said.

416
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,920
"It's all fun and no work for you, isn't it?"

417
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,640
"Hey, Rachel. This isn't the real me."

418
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:41,360
"The things you do are important, Bruce, not the things you
say." And she walked away.

419
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,640
Batman went to see Sergeant Gordon.

420
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:51,080
"There was someone in Falcone's office with him that night,"
he said.

421
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,920
"He was testing the drugs. Do you know who it was?"

422
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,160
"No, I don't," answered Gordon.

423
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:06,840
"Dr Crane from Arkham Asylum often visits Falcone. Perhaps
it was him."

424
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,040
"Yes, perhaps it was," said Batman.

425
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,680
"I think I'll go to Arkham Asylum."

426
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,880
"It's not safe," said Gordon.

427
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,760
"It's in the Narrows, a very dangerous part of Gotham."

428
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,080
"Not for me," said Batman.

429
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,000
Batman soon arrived at the Narrows.

430
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,360
Behind Arkham Asylum was a dark building.

431
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,720
Batman went inside and found a very big ship's box.

432
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,880
It was difficult to open.

433
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,080
At last he was able to push open the top.

434
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,880
Inside there was a machine - it was the size of a big car.

435
00:30:51,880 --> 00:31:01,520
Batman read the words on the box: "WAYNE ENTERPRISES
47B1-ME".

436
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,160
Two people came into the building.

437
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,400
One was a ship worker.

438
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,000
The other was a man in a dark suit.

439
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,000
They didn't see Batman.

440
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,440
"What are the boss's orders?" asked the man in the dark
suit.

441
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,200
"We keep the machine here until he's ready," said the ship
worker.

442
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,680
"Fine," said the man in the dark suit.

443
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,600
It was Dr Crane.

444
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,440
Batman suddenly flew from the box to the floor.

445
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,920
"No, it isn't fine," he said.

446
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,080
He hit the ship worker in the face and he fell to the floor.

447
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,680
Crane quickly put on his mask, and then he waved his arm at
Batman.

448
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,120
WHOOOOSSSSSHH

449
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,920
A cloud of white smoke came out of his coat.

450
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,040
Batman's nose and mouth were suddenly on fire.

451
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,120
He started to see all the worst things from his life in
front of his eyes.

452
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,640
"I've felt this way before," he thought.

453
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,760
"But where?"

454
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:24,240
Then he remembered - Ra's al Ghul, the wooden box, the bats,
the building on fire...

455
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,440
He got to the window on his hands and feet.

456
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,320
Crane watched him.

457
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,520
"You're going to die, Batman," he said.

458
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:41,360
Batman climbed slowly through the window, up the wall and
onto the roof.

459
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,280
He pulled out his mobile phone.

460
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,880
"Alfred," he said.

461
00:32:46,920 --> 00:33:00,360
"Alfred, I-I need you. Please come quickly. I'm ill. And I
need a blood test."

462
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,960
Terrible thoughts were now in Bruce's head.

463
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,160
He was at the show... the bats... his parents... a gun...
blood in the street...

464
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,240
And then - nothing.

465
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,920
He opened his eyes.

466
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,280
He was home, in his bedroom.

467
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,240
Alfred came in.

468
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,200
"How long have I been asleep?" Bruce asked.

469
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,120
"Two days, sir," answered Alfred.

470
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,760
"It's your birthday today."

471
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,120
"It was the white smoke," said Bruce.

472
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:54,560
"Luckily there wasn't very much of it. But I've felt like that once before in my life. On the mountain in Bhutan. But
this time it seemed much stronger."

473
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,440
"I've got the results of the blood test," said Alfred.

474
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,080
He gave Bruce a piece of paper.

475
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,080
"It's a very dangerous drug," he said.

476
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:11,280
"It can kill people. But I know someone who can make an
antidote."

477
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,920
The next day, Bruce showed the results to Lucius Fox.

478
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,760
"This was in your blood?!" he said.

479
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,520
"You're lucky you didn't die!"

480
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,040
"Yes, I've been very lucky," said Bruce.

481
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,640
"Can you make an antidote?"

482
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,440
"I think so," said Fox, "but it won't be easy."

483
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,120
"One more thing," said Bruce.

484
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:45,680
"Do you know what Wayne Enterprises 47B1-ME is?"

485
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,040
"No, I don't," said Fox.

486
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,800
"But I can probably find out."

487
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,040
Sergeant Gordon went to see Rachel.

488
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,560
"Will Falcone go to prison this time?" he asked her.

489
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,200
"I think so," said Rachel.

490
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,480
"It's in all the newspapers."

491
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,720
"Batman came to see me, Miss Dawes," said Gordon.

492
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,720
"He asked for my help."

493
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,400
"Yes, I know," said Rachel.

494
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:22,760
"He came to see me too. We're working with a man in a mask,
Sergeant Gordon. Perhaps he's dangerous."

495
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,760
"I don't think so," said Gordon.

496
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,720
"He's done lots of good things already."

497
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,200
The door opened and Bruce Wayne came in.

498
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,800
"Oh sorry," he said.

499
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,600
"I'll come back later."

500
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,120
Gordon knew Bruce Wayne from the newspapers.

501
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,920
"It's OK, Mr Wayne," he said.

502
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,920
"I was just leaving." He went out.

503
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,800
"What do you want, Bruce?" Rachel asked angrily.

504
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,520
"I want to invite you to a party tonight," he said.

505
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,560
"And to say I'm sorry."

506
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,520
Rachel smiled.

507
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,200
She could never be really cross with him.

508
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
"Where's the party?"

509
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,040
"It's at home - at Wayne Manor," he said.

510
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,240
An officer opened the door.

511
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:17,480
"They've moved Falcone from the police station to Arkham
Asylum," he said.

512
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,320
"Who decided that?" asked Rachel.

513
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,720
"The boss there, Dr Crane."

514
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,040
Rachel quickly put some things into a bag.

515
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,320
"I have to go," she said to Bruce.

516
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,000
"And I don't think I can come to your party tonight. I'm
sorry."

517
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,440
She opened the door and turned to Bruce.

518
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,880
"Happy Birthday, Bruce!" she said.

519
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:52,440
CHAPTER FIVE

520
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,120
"Ra'S Al Ghul is Dead"

521
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:00,320
Rachel was in Dr Crane's office at the asylum.

522
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,040
Batman was listening outside the building.

523
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:11,880
"Falcone is just going to prison when he suddenly becomes
mentally ill," said Rachel.

524
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,480
"Isn't that a little strange, Dr Crane?"

525
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:22,920
"Would you like to see Falcone, Miss Dawes? Then you'll be
able to decide for yourself," said Crane.

526
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,160
"Come with me. I'll show you."

527
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,280
Falcone lay on his bed.

528
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,920
He couldn't move.

529
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:38,960
"Mask... mask... mask..." he was saying.

530
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,880
"You've given him drugs!" said Rachel.

531
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,480
"Yes, of course." said Crane.

532
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,960
"We give drugs to all our people here. It's a hospital!"

533
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,600
"The police doctor must see him and do some blood tests,"
said Rachel.

534
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,640
"I'm going to call him right now."

535
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,360
"Very well," said Crane.

536
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,280
"Come this way."

537
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,920
They went down some stairs and came to a door.

538
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,280
It had an electronic lock.

539
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,920
Crane put some numbers in and it opened.

540
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,800
They turned right and walked to a large room.

541
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,280
There were hundreds of small blue bags on the tables.

542
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,960
People in white coats were working at the tables.

543
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,120
"We make our drugs here," said Crane.

544
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,720
Rachel turned and ran.

545
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,120
She got to the door, but Crane had locked it again.

546
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,200
She pushed different numbers.

547
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,720
Nothing happened.

548
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:49,200
Suddenly a horrible masked man appeared next to her... and
then a cloud of white smoke...

549
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,680
Rachel lay on a table.

550
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,760
"Who knows you're here?" shouted Crane.

551
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,840
"I want to know before I kill you."

552
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,800
"What do we do now?" asked one of the men.

553
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,640
"Call the police," said Crane.

554
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,080
"You want the police here?" asked the other man.

555
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,520
He was surprised.

556
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,080
"Batman's here," said Crane.

557
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,600
"I'm sure of it. The police will catch him."

558
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,920
Suddenly a black thing flew at them and hit the two men.

559
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,760
They fell to the floor.

560
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,840
Batman looked around.

561
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,800
Where was Crane?

562
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,800
He heard a sound behind him and turned.

563
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,320
In the dark he saw a mask and a hand.

564
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,880
Batman pulled the mask off Crane's face.

565
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,080
He held Crane's hand under his own nose.

566
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,120
Smoke came from a bottle inside Crane's coat.

567
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,560
White smoke.

568
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,240
WHOOOOOOSSSSSSH!

569
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,360
Crane's body dropped to the floor.

570
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,640
"Who are you working for?" shouted Batman.

571
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
"Who's your boss?"

572
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:07,640
"Ra's... Ra's al Ghul," said Crane.

573
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,920
He spoke with great difficulty.

574
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,040
"Ra's al Ghul is dead, Crane," said Batman.

575
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,640
"Who are you really working for?"

576
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,280
Crane's eyes closed.

577
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,800
He said only a few words.

578
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:34,360
"Mask... drugs... smoke... water... steam..."

579
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,720
There was a loud voice outside.

580
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:47,840
"Batman, come out. There are police everywhere. We are all
around the building. You can't escape."

581
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,080
Batman found Rachel.

582
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,720
He took her in his arms and climbed up to the roof.

583
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,480
Sergeant Gordon went into the building to find Batman.

584
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,960
He started to climb the stairs.

585
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,320
Suddenly he felt an arm around him and he was flying up and
up.

586
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,400
Batman dropped him carefully onto the roof.

587
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,560
Then Gordon saw Rachel lying there.

588
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,040
"What's happened to her?" he asked.

589
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,280
"Crane gave her a dangerous drug," said Batman.

590
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:28,440
"She'll die very soon. I must get the antidote for her."

591
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,000
"How will you escape?" asked Gordon.

592
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,720
"I'm going to call for help," said Batman.

593
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,640
He pushed something on his shoe - it made a very high sound.

594
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,640
A big, black cloud started to grow in the sky above Gotham.

595
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,120
It grew and grew and moved nearer and nearer.

596
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,040
Finally it came down on the hospital roof.

597
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,720
Bats!

598
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,200
Thousands of bats!

599
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,440
They flew all around Bruce and Rachel.

600
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,720
The bats hid Batman and Rachel until they reached the
Batmobile.

601
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,880
Batman drove home to the Batcave.

602
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,160
When they arrived, Bruce looked at Rachel carefully.

603
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,080
Her eyes were closed and she wasn't moving.

604
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,600
She was cold.

605
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,240
He carried her from the Batmobile to the worktable.

606
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,320
He gave her the antidote.

607
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,000
He hoped that it wasn't too late.

608
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,520
At Arkham Asylum there were police everywhere.

609
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,000
A young police officer ran over to Sergeant Gordon.

610
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,000
"Sir!" he shouted.

611
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,560
"There's something that you must see."

612
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,000
Gordon followed him into another big room.

613
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,440
In the centre of the floor was a small door.

614
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,000
It was open.

615
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,280
Gordon looked through the door and saw the river below.

616
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,640
There were five or six large bottles next to the door.

617
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,880
"They've used the river for something," said Gordon, "but
what?"

618
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,320
He looked at the bottles.

619
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,480
"I want to speak to someone at the Water Office," he
shouted.

620
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,760
"Now!"

621
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,040
Rachel woke up.

622
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,120
She felt terrible.

623
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,240
"How do you feel?" someone asked.

624
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,960
She knew the voice.

625
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,760
She looked at the face.

626
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,520
It was Batman!

627
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,720
"Where am I?" she asked.

628
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,920
"Why did you bring me here?"

629
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,000
"You were very ill," he said.

630
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,640
"I rescued you."

631
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:52,720
"I remember now. That horrible mask," she said.

632
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:59,400
"It was Crane. I must tell Sergeant Gordon."

633
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,120
She tried to move.

634
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:06,480
"No, don't get up. Stay where you are," said Batman.

635
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,080
"Sergeant Gordon has got Crane already."

636
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,280
"Why did you save my life?" she asked.

637
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,760
"Gotham needs you," he said.

638
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:30,000
"Here, take this. It will help you sleep. When you wake up,
please find Sergeant Gordon. Give him these."

639
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,960
He held up two small bottles.

640
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,560
"Only Gordon. No one else."

641
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,600
"What are they?" she asked.

642
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,480
"The antidote to this killer drug," said Batman.

643
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:54,080
"One bottle is for Gordon himself. He can use the other
bottle to make some more of the antidote for everyone."

644
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:01,320
"Crane wasn't the boss. He was working for someone else,"
Rachel said.

645
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,200
"Something al Ghul."

646
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,440
"Ra's al Ghul," said Batman.

647
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:18,240
"No, it's not Ra's al Ghul. He's dead. I was there when he
died."

648
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,280
But Rachel was asleep.

649
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,680
CHAPTER SIX

650
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:32,000
A Surprise Guest

651
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
In the empty workroom, Sergeant Gordon was talking on the
phone.

652
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,240
"Someone has put a dangerous drug into the city's water,"
Gordon said.

653
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:52,680
"Well, we test the water every day," answered the man from
the Water Office, "and today's results seem fine."

654
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,600
"Perhaps it's safe to drink but dangerous to smell," said
Gordon.

655
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,760
"That's possible," said the water man.

656
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,960
When he finished his phone call, Gordon saw the large ship's
box.

657
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,720
"What's that?" he asked.

658
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,520
"Let's open it." They got the top off and found a machine.

659
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,240
"It's bigger than a car," said an officer.

660
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,120
"What does it say on it?"

661
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:27,920
"WAYNE ENTERPRISES 47B1-ME," Gordon read.

662
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,720
"What does it do?" asked an officer.

663
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,160
"I've no idea," answered Gordon.

664
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,760
"But no one must go near it. OK?"

665
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,200
Bruce left the cave and went up into the house.

666
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,800
Everyone was having a great time at his birthday party.

667
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,800
When he appeared, they all sang "Happy Birthday to you!"

668
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,160
Bruce walked around saying hello to his guests.

669
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,400
Finally he found the person he wanted.

670
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,880
Lucius Fox.

671
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:08,520
"That machine-" he said quietly, "Have you found out
anything?"

672
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,800
"Yes, I have. It can change water into steam," Fox said.

673
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,880
Bruce thought for a moment.

674
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,680
"So you could put a dangerous drug in the water," he said.

675
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:30,360
"And then you could change the water into steam and kill
everyone in the city. Could you?"

676
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,680
"Yes, you could," said Fox.

677
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:40,600
"Oh no!" Bruce went quietly across the room towards the
door.

678
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,720
He had to leave as soon as possible.

679
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,200
But on the way, a woman took his arm.

680
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,080
It was Mrs Delane, an old friend of his father.

681
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,600
"Bruce!" she said.

682
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,080
"I want you to meet someone."

683
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,400
"I'm sorry. I can't stop now, Mrs Delane," said Bruce.

684
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,040
"I have to..."

685
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,120
But then he looked at the man with Mrs Delane.

686
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,400
The man wore a blue flower in his jacket.

687
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,960
"This is Mr al Ghul, Bruce," said Mrs Delane.

688
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,080
"You're not Ra's al Ghul," Bruce said to the man.

689
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:21,920
"No, you're right, Bruce," said a voice behind him.

690
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,560
He turned around.

691
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,200
It was Ducard.

692
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,320
"He isn't Ra's al Ghul," said "Ducard".

693
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:40,720
"I am. I'm not Ducard. I never was. And you, Bruce, were my
best student until you escaped."

694
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,880
Bruce looked around the room and saw that he didn't know
some of the people there.

695
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,720
They weren't his friends.

696
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,200
They were Ninjas!

697
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,280
His guests were in danger.

698
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,480
They had to get out fast.

699
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,800
What could he do?

700
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:16,280
He took a glass and shouted, "Let's drink to my birthday! Let's drink to all my guests! You don't like me, do you?
You're here because you like my money. You just want some free food and drink!"

701
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,960
The guests were very upset and angry.

702
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,280
They left the house at once.

703
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,040
They got in their cars and drove away.

704
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,200
Ra's al Ghul laughed.

705
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,440
"They will die very soon anyway," he said.

706
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,080
"So was Crane working for you?" asked Bruce.

707
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,040
"Yes, he was," said Ra's al Ghul.

708
00:49:41,080 --> 00:50:20,560
"But he was only interested in money. I want much more than that. When Gotham dies, people everywhere will be
frightened. There will be fighting and killing all over the world. Man will disappear. No more people. The world will be wonderful again. I saved you, Bruce, but you fought me. You set fire to my home. Since then your activities have made trouble for us. Now we're going to make trouble for you."

709
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:27,200
Ra's al Ghul shouted an order to his men, "Go ahead!"

710
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,320
The Ninjas started to set fire to the furniture.

711
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:39,640
Some kilometres away at Arkham Asylum, four police officers
were standing around the machine.

712
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:48,080
"What did Gordon say? "No one must go near it," one of them
said. "Except us, of course."

713
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,040
They all laughed.

714
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,440
Another one looked at his watch.

715
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,160
"It's time," he said.

716
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,120
They turned on the machine and then put explosives along the
wall.

717
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,200
They weren't following Sergeant Gordon's orders.

718
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:09,280
At the same time, high above the city, a train driver looked
at his watch.

719
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,960
"The train stops here," he said.

720
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,800
"Everyone out!"

721
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,880
The passengers got out.

722
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:22,080
The same thing was happening on buses and trains all over
the city.

723
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,360
Everything in Gotham stopped.

724
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:30,000
Sergeant Gordon was standing outside Arkham Asylum.

725
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,360
Rachel ran towards him.

726
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,680
She gave him the two small bottles.

727
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,920
"These are from Batman."

728
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,480
FOOOOM!

729
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,920
Before he could answer, there was a big explosion.

730
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,960
Gordon ran towards the room with the machine.

731
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,800
There was no wall.

732
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,400
Four police officers were pushing the machine outside.

733
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,960
One of them pushed something on the machine.

734
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,320
It started to make a strange sound.

735
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,160
FOOOOM!

736
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,520
There was a second explosion.

737
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,280
FOOOOM!

738
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,080
Then another.

739
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,160
FOOOOM!

740
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,160
Then another.

741
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,640
There was steam everywhere.

742
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,160
A small cloud of steam moved towards Gordon.

743
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,840
The smell reached him.

744
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,160
His nose and mouth were on fire.

745
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:22,600
At the Water Office, the workers were looking at a map of
Gotham City.

746
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,440
There were small lights all over the map.

747
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,520
All the lights were green.

748
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,800
Except one.

749
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,520
The light at Arkham Asylum was red.

750
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,800
Wayne Manor was on fire.

751
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,560
"Have you come to kill me?" Bruce asked Ra's.

752
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,720
"No," said Ra's.

753
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,720
"I've come to ask you a question. Will you join us?"

754
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,960
"Never!" said Bruce.

755
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,000
"I don't want to be part of this."

756
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:56,680
"Then fight me," said Ra's, "and die with Gotham."

757
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,680
He took out a sword.

758
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:05,200
They fought and fought until finally Bruce stood over Ra's
with his sword above Ra's head.

759
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,680
"You taught me very well, Ra's," he said.

760
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:19,080
"Yes, I did," said Ra's, "but you always forget to look very
carefully at the things around you."

761
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,880
CRRRAAACCCK!

762
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,040
Bruce looked up.

763
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,800
The roof was on fire.

764
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,640
Part of it was falling towards him.

765
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,200
BANG!

766
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,360
It hit him and he fell to the floor.

767
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,080
"Goodbye, my friend," said Ra's.

768
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,640
He ran out of the building.

769
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,960
A car was waiting for him.

770
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:49,040
CHAPTER SEVEN

771
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,880
CRAAAASSSSHHHHH!!!!

772
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:56,920
"Master Bruce! Master Bruce! Get up!"

773
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,400
Bruce opened his eyes.

774
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,360
Alfred was next to him.

775
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,040
And a part of the roof lay on top of him.

776
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,280
"Push!" said Alfred.

777
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,520
"You're strong. You can do it."

778
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:16,000
Bruce pushed and pushed, and finally Alfred moved the piece
of roof to one side.

779
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,680
Bruce got up and they escaped to the cave below.

780
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,640
"Oh, Alfred," he said.

781
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:31,240
"What have I done? Wayne Manor is on fire and I can't help
Gotham. I've made so many mistakes."

782
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,360
Alfred smiled.

783
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,000
"And why do we fall, sir?" he asked.

784
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:45,360
"We fall," said Bruce, "so that we can learn to get up
again. I must go!"

785
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,440
He changed into his Batsuit and took off in the Batmobile.

786
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,640
FFFWHOOOOSSSHH!

787
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,040
In a few minutes he was in Gotham.

788
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,960
The criminals from Arkham Asylum were running everywhere.

789
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,720
They were shouting and dancing and breaking things.

790
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,520
Rachel watched.

791
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,600
Above her a train stopped.

792
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:13,120
Some men in masks started to move a large machine onto it.

793
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,760
She ran to find Sergeant Gordon in the asylum.

794
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,920
He was sitting on the floor.

795
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,360
She could see that he was very ill.

796
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,600
He needed the antidote fast.

797
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,840
She took one of the bottles out of his pocket.

798
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,080
"It's OK," she said.

799
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,160
"I can help you."

800
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:36,240
Rachel gave Gordon the antidote and he slowly started to
feel better.

801
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,360
The people from the asylum were shouting and coming nearer.

802
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,440
They were feeling bad from the white cloud.

803
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,000
Suddenly they started running towards Rachel and Gordon.

804
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,200
"Oh no!" thought Rachel.

805
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,120
"They're going to kill us."

806
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:53,920
WHOMMMM!

807
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,520
The Batmobile arrived from nowhere.

808
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,040
Batman ran towards Rachel.

809
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,760
He gave Gordon the keys to the Batmobile.

810
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,320
"Drive carefully," he said.

811
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:12,480
Batman took Rachel in his arms and climbed up to the roof
with her - above the dangerous cloud.

812
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,000
Gordon ran to the Batmobile.

813
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,600
From the roof Rachel and Batman could see all of Gotham.

814
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:25,240
"They were putting a large machine onto the train," said
Rachel.

815
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,920
Just then, the train started to move.

816
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,520
Batman suddenly understood.

817
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,880
"Of course," he said.

818
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:49,920
"The railway line runs exactly over the river next to Wayne Tower. Ra's is going to use the machine there. He's going to
turn the city's water into steam. He's going to kill everyone."

819
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,880
Batman moved to the edge of the roof.

820
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,240
"Batman, don't jump!" said Rachel.

821
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,720
"You could die. Please tell me your name."

822
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:06,400
"The things I do are important, not the things I say."

823
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,040
"Bruce?... Bruce!" shouted Rachel.

824
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,880
But Batman couldn't hear.

825
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,440
He was flying down.

826
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,720
He landed on the roof of the train and held on.

827
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,560
BANG!

828
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,480
BANG!

829
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,200
BANG!

830
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,120
People inside the train fired guns through the roof.

831
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,560
They hit Batman three times.

832
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,120
He fell off the roof.

833
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:34,720
The Ninjas in the last car of the train looked out of the
window.

834
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,720
First they looked up.

835
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,960
No Batman.

836
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,720
Then they looked down.

837
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,240
Batman was still there!

838
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:48,480
He was hanging from a long line, flying from side to side
under the train.

839
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,640
On a street below the train, there was a Ninja in the back
of a green car.

840
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,800
He was pointing his machine gun at Batman.

841
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,680
Gordon came around the corner in the Batmobile.

842
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,840
He was driving very fast.

843
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,120
KERZAMMM!!

844
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,160
He hit the green car.

845
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,200
It crashed and exploded into a ball of fire.

846
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,160
Batman climbed up the line to the train.

847
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,200
He got into the last car and finished the Ninjas there.

848
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,080
Then he went to the front of the train.

849
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,880
When he reached the first car, Ra's turned.

850
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,120
His mouth opened.

851
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,800
"You!?!" he said.

852
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,840
He took out his sword and ran at Batman.

853
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,160
Batman quickly moved to the front edge of the train.

854
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,560
Ra's lifted his sword over Batman's head.

855
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,360
Batman held it and broke it in two.

856
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:49,560
The train was moving nearer and nearer to the centre of
Gotham.

857
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,520
It was moving nearer and nearer to Wayne Tower.

858
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,600
"I must stop the train," thought Batman.

859
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:02,120
He reached out of the front of the train and threw Ra's al
Ghul's sword under the wheels.

860
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,040
There was a terrible noise.

861
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:10,400
Ra's threw himself onto Batman and put his hands over his
mouth and nose.

862
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,160
Batman couldn't move.

863
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,680
Everything started to go black.

864
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:20,000
"Now you're really frightened, aren't you?" said Ra's.

865
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,800
Batman looked into Ra's face.

866
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,960
He saw the end of the world there.

867
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,760
That made Batman angry.

868
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,120
And when he was angry, he was strong.

869
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:38,880
He suddenly pushed hard against Ra's and flew out of the
train and into the sky.

870
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,600
Ra's looked up in surprise and anger.

871
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,640
Then he was very frightened.

872
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,440
The train was going to crash in less than a second.

873
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,360
It came off the railway line and fell down and down.

874
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,880
And then-

875
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,120
CRRAAASSSSHHHHH!!!!

876
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:04,280
It landed in the car park in front of Wayne Tower and
exploded into a ball of fire.

877
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:10,880
Soon all the bad guys were in prison or out of a job.

878
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,560
The people of Gotham began to build their great city again.

879
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,480
Everyone wanted to work together now.

880
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:24,600
William Earle walked into his office the day after the train
crash.

881
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,920
He found Lucius Fox behind his desk.

882
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,560
"What are you doing in my office?" he asked.

883
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,800
"It's my office now," said Fox happily.

884
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,040
"I'm the new boss of Wayne Enterprises."

885
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,640
"Who says?" Earle asked.

886
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,200
"I say," said Bruce from behind Earle.

887
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,440
"It's my business. Goodbye, Mr Earle."

888
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,080
There were builders at Wayne Manor.

889
01:00:53,080 --> 01:01:00,400
They were slowly and carefully building a new house -
exactly like the old one.

890
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,520
Bruce went to the old well in the garden.

891
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,240
He put a big piece of wood across the top.

892
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,680
Rachel was there with him.

893
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:15,240
"I fell down this well a long time ago. Do you remember?" he
asked her.

894
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,080
"Of course," she answered.

895
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:22,280
"Things were never the same after that," he said.

896
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,760
"What was different?" she asked.

897
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,040
Bruce put another piece of wood across the well.

898
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,600
Now it was completely closed.

899
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:39,080
"I wasn't a child anymore, he said. "I began to be a man."

900
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,840
"You're a great man, Bruce," she said.

901
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,120
Bruce looked at her.

902
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,960
She could see that he loved her.

903
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:55,000
"There's no place for me between Batman and Bruce Wayne,"
she said.

904
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,720
"I don't have to be Batman," he said.

905
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,400
"I can choose my own life."

906
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,640
"No," she said.

907
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:14,920
"I don't think you can. Great people can't always choose
their lives. Gotham needs you. Goodbye, Bruce."

908
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,960
"Goodbye, Rachel," he said.

909
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,680
"I'll do my best for Gotham."

910
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:35,120
"I know you will," she said.
