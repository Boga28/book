00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,400
It is Monday afternoon and Lisa is in her bedroom, talking
on the phone with her friend Ellie.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,400
Lisa is holding an official-looking envelope in her hand.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,200
"It is from the Young Reporters Association," Lisa tells her
friend.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,760
"I wonder... what is it about?"

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,840
"Go on then, what are you waiting for?" asks Ellie.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,720
"Open it right away, I'm so excited!"

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:39,360
Lisa opens the letter and reads aloud:

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,560
Dear Liza,

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:52,520
We are very happy to inform you that the young Reporters Association has randomly selected you to participate in the
1st International Photo Convention with your photographs.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,840
The convention will take place on 27-31July, in Beijing.

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:06,360
You will also have another six days for sightseeing on a
train-tour with Hu Tian, one of our Chinese members.

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,800
The young Reporters Association will plan and pay for the
whole trip.

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,280
So, pack your bags, Lisa.

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,280
You are going to China!

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,480
Yiao Ming

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,240
General Secretary of the Young Reporters Association

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,000
"They want to send me to China! I can't believe my luck!"
she exclaims.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,560
"I have never been to China before. What an interesting
place to go!"

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,480
"Lisa! That's great news!" exclaims Ellie.

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,080
"I know!" answers Lisa.

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,720
"I have never been to China, but it has always been one of
my dreams," she says.

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,560
"Yes, it's an amazing opportunity for you," says Ellie.

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,800
"And, when you get back, you could write a report about your
trip for the school on-line newspaper. What do you think?"

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,400
"Oh, Ellie," laughs Lisa.

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,960
"OK. You never seem to forget your position at the paper, do
you?"

27
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,240
"Well, I'm not the editor for nothing," the girl laughs
back.

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,960
"Let's hang up now," she adds.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,560
"You have to do some research before the trip, don't you
think?"

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,800
"You're right," says Lisa.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,840
"China, here I come!"

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,400
CHAPTER TWO

33
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,960
After a long flight, Lisa finally arrives in Beijing.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,400
At the airport, a young man is waiting for her.

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:41,960
He is holding a sign reading "Lisa, YRA." Lisa goes towards
him and the man greets her warmly.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,720
"Nice to meet you, Lisa," he says and introduces himself.

37
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:57,400
"I am Hu Tian and I work for a local teen magazine here in Beijing. I will be your guide in China!" he says as he takes
her suitcase.

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,040
Lisa is relieved.

39
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,280
Everything is so strange to her here and there are so many
people everywhere!

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,960
Hu Tian takes Lisa to her hotel by taxi.

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:20,200
"You must be tired after your long trip," he says when they
arrive.

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,920
"Have some rest, and we'll meet again in the afternoon.
Then, you can have a taste of China."

43
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,680
Lisa smiles as she goes to her hotel room.

44
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,080
"I wonder what he meant," she thinks to herself.

45
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,280
"Oh, well... I guess I'll find out in a few hours," she says
and falls asleep right away.

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,880
After her nap, Lisa feels like a new person.

47
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,320
She meets up with Hu Tian and his sister, Mei.

48
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,040
The two take her to a restaurant in the Old City.

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,200
"So that's what you meant with 'a taste of China!' Lisa
exclaims.

50
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,000
"Yes," smiles Hu Tian. "You're going to enjoy a traditional
Beijing dinner."

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,160
Lisa remembers the delicious Chinese food in New York and is
excited to try some authentic Chinese cuisine.

52
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Maybe it will be even tastier.

53
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,400
At the restaurant, Lisa sees a round piece of glass in the
centre of the table.

54
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,000
"I know!" shouts Lisa.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:38,160
"It's a rotating tray! The waiter puts all of the dishes on the tray so that the people at the table can turn it and try
each of the different kinds of food," she says with a smile.

56
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:47,680
"It is customary to try a little bit of everything. It is also polite to always leave the last bite on the plate,"
says Mei.

57
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,280
When the waiter comes to the table, they order traditional
tea and several different dishes.

58
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,560
"We ordered Peking Duck, it's a famous dish here," explains
Mei.

59
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,600
The cook then brings the roast duck and cuts it in front of
them.

60
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,560
A waiter also brings different dishes to eat along with the
duck.

61
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,760
Lisa is impressed.

62
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,480
"What are all these little bowls?" asks Lisa.

63
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,560
"There are pancakes in this one and vegetables and three
different kinds of sauces."

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,160
Hu Tian and Mei laugh.

65
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,640
"Let me show you how to eat Peking Duck" says Mei.

66
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,800
"First, you take a pancake. Then, you put some sauce and
some vegetables on your pancake."

67
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,560
"Ok, I got that," says Lisa.

68
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,320
"This is fun, actually."

69
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,960
"Now put some duck in the pancake and wrap it. Enjoy!" says
Mei, smiling to the girl.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,520
"Mmmm, delicious," says Lisa.

71
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,400
"No wonder it's so famous!"

72
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,160
They take turns turning the tray and tasting the different
kinds of food.

73
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,200
Hu Tian and Mei are eating with chopsticks.

74
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,280
"Is it difficult to eat with chopsticks?" asks Lisa.

75
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,880
"No, not really," says Hu Tian and Mei offers to teach her.

76
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,280
"I've never learnt so much at a dinner table before!" Lisa
says with a giggle.

77
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,800
It is a fun evening of new experiences.

78
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,880
CHAPTER THREE

79
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,880
The next day is very busy.

80
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:37,080
Lisa spends almost all morning at the Photo Convention,
presenting her work and talking to lots of people.

81
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,720
Then, she and Hu Tian meet with Mei and they go to Tiananmen
Square.

82
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:54,360
"Wow, this square is huge! It is much larger than any other
square I have ever been to!" Lisa exclaims.

83
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,720
"This, my dear, is the largest city square in the world!"
boasts Hu Tian.

84
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,280
"One million people can fit here!"

85
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,960
"And who's that in the picture over there?" asks Lisa.

86
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,520
"It's Mao Zedong, the founder of the People's Republic of
China," explains Hu Tian.

87
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,160
Next, the three friends take a tour of the Forbidden City.

88
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:25,400
Lisa is impressed by the artwork and history she discovers
there.

89
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:52,640
"The Forbidden City is about 600 years old. It used to be the Chinese Emperor's palace. You see, in Chinese history
there were no kings or queens, we had emperors and empresses. Now the place is a huge museum, 'The Palace Museum.' Common people could not enter the Forbidden City; that is why they called it Forbidden," says Hu Tian.

90
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,360
Lisa and her friends are now in The Hall of Supreme Harmony.

91
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,040
"The Emperor's throne is here," says Mei.

92
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,560
Lisa looks around.

93
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,680
There are dragons everywhere.

94
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,760
Lisa is impressed and asks Mei about it.

95
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,520
"The dragon is a symbol of power, strength and good luck,"
Mei explains.

96
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,080
"It was also the symbol of the Emperor himself."

97
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:28,240
"In the Hall of Supreme Harmony, experts counted 13,844
dragons!" adds Hu Tian.

98
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,720
As they walk towards the exit, Lisa hears Hu Tian's voice.

99
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,960
"Come on, Lisa," Hu Tian shouts.

100
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,520
"I'm hungry. Let's have some lunch!"

101
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,120
"That sounds great!" Lisa replies.

102
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,440
"Where shall we eat?" she asks as they walk towards the
exit.

103
00:08:48,480 --> 00:09:02,640
"I know! Let's have a picnic near Tiananmen Square. We can buy some sandwiches over there," Hu Tian suggests, pointing
to a shop across the street.

104
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,240
They sit down on a bench and have a lovely picnic in the
warm sun.

105
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,640
Lisa is admiring a very large, modern building across the
street.

106
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,160
"That is a beautiful building," says Lisa.

107
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,200
"It looks like a giant egg, doesn't it?"

108
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,800
"You're right, Lisa," says Mei.

109
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:32,080
"It is the National Center for the Performing Arts, but the local people just call it 'The Egg.' Concerts, operas and
plays take place there."

110
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,400
After lunch, they go to the Olympic Green, the most modern
part of Beijing.

111
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,840
"Wow! Look at all those buildings!" Lisa exclaims.

112
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
"That one looks like an ice cube."

113
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:58,560
"Yes, it's a very interesting building. That's the National Aquatics Center. It housed the swimming and diving
competitions of the Summer Olympic Games in 2008," replies Hu Tian.

114
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:09,120
"See that one over there?" says Mei, pointing at a very strange structure, "That's the National Stadium, the Bird's
Nest. Can you see why?"

115
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,320
"Of course, it's like a gigantic bird's nest!" Lisa replies.

116
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,560
"China has certainly changed a lot since the times of the
emperors in the Forbidden City!"

117
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:27,240
CHAPTER FOUR

118
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:34,360
For Lisa's last day in Beijing, Hu Tian and Mei have a
special surprise for her.

119
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,840
They decide to take their friend on a short trip.

120
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,920
"Where are we going?" asks Lisa at the bus station.

121
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,120
"We can't tell you. It's a surprise," says Hu Tian with a
grin.

122
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,560
"Yes, you'll see when we get there," says Mei with a giggle.

123
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,520
"Now, let's get on the bus."

124
00:10:53,520 --> 00:11:01,320
The scenery changes outside the bus window.

125
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:12,040
The tall skyscrapers and cars of the city soon give way to smaller buildings and fewer cars, until there are only
endless golden fields.

126
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,000
"Where we are going?" Lisa wonders.

127
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,680
Then, she looks outside the window and suddenly realises.

128
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:28,320
"Wow! The Great Wall of China! One of the greatest wonders
of the world!" she exclaims.

129
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,960
"How long is it, anyway?" she asks her friends.

130
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:43,760
"The Great Wall of China is 8,851.8 km or 5,500 miles long,"
Hu Tian says proudly.

131
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,200
"And it's more than 2,000 years old!" he continues.

132
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:56,840
"The Emperor Qin Shihuang of the Qin Dynasty started the
Wall around 221BC," adds Mei.

133
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,720
"But work continued during the Han and until the Ming
Dynasty in the 14th century," she says.

134
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,920
"Thousands, if not millions, of people worked day and night
to finish the Wall."

135
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,760
"It's very impressive," says Lisa as the three walk to the
closest part of the Great Wall.

136
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,160
It is on a steep hill.

137
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:27,840
"This is a beautiful walk, but it is harder than it looks,"
Lisa says, stopping to catch her breath.

138
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,800
"Don't worry," Hu Tian replies.

139
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,160
"You will be able to relax later."

140
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,400
"What do you mean?" she asks.

141
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,200
"It's another surprise," Hu Tian says, smiling.

142
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:50,000
"A whole day of surprises! This is so much fun! You two are great!" Lisa says as she takes photos of her new friends and
the Great Wall.

143
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,120
"Now say 'cheese'!"

144
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,920
A little later, Hu Tian and Mei look at Lisa and smile.

145
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,400
"It is time to show you a different China," says Hu Tian.

146
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:12,640
"I have no idea what you're talking about, but I'm sure it's going to be another great experience," Lisa says, smiling
back.

147
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:24,400
Another bus takes them beyond the fields until they reach a
small farming village.

148
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,680
They get off and see an elderly man and woman.

149
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,640
"Ni hao," they greet the three friends in Chinese.

150
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,560
"Hello," says Lisa and then turns to Hu Tian and Mei.

151
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
"They are our aunt and uncle," says Mei.

152
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,480
"They don't speak English but they are very friendly."

153
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,680
Then they all walk down a small road with gates and walls on
all sides.

154
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,880
They enter one of the gateways.

155
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:03,280
"This is our aunt and uncle's house. It is very
traditional," says Mei.

156
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,560
Next, they all sit down and have tea together.

157
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,280
"Tea is very important in Chinese culture," explains Mei.

158
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,800
"Chinese people drink a lot of tea, and we also celebrate a
number of occasions with tea ceremonies."

159
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,560
"Oh, good," smiles Lisa.

160
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,640
"I love tea, it's my favourite drink!"

161
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:38,200
On their way back a few hours later, Lisa remarks: "It was so exciting to see what life is like for people in the
countryside. It is very different from the busy Beijing life."

162
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:45,000
"Well, a lot of Chinese still live in villages like that,
not cities," explains Hu Tian.

163
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,400
"What do you think of life in the village?"

164
00:14:47,400 --> 00:15:00,320
"Hmm... the village is quieter and the countryside around it is very beautiful. However, there is more technology in the
city and more things to do than in the village," says Lisa thoughtfully.

165
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,960
"I guess that city life and village life are both nice, but
in different ways."

166
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:12,440
CHAPTER FIVE

167
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,320
The next stop on Lisa's trip is even more interesting.

168
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:27,080
After getting a good night's sleep on the train from Beijing to Xi'an, Lisa, Mei and Hu Tian go to see the Terracotta
Army.

169
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,840
They take a guided tour of the ancient site.

170
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:47,400
"The Terracotta Soldiers' purpose was to protect Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China, after his death. His tomb
has about eight thousand clay soldiers surrounding it. It is a truly amazing sight," says the guide.

171
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,640
"I've seen nothing like this before," whispers Lisa into
Mei's ear.

172
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,240
"They look alike, but they are all different."

173
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,640
"Each soldier's face is unique," the guide continues.

174
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:38,120
"The soldiers are as tall as real people and they had swords, knives, crossbows and other weapons. Surprisingly,
all these were as sharp as new! According to their roles, the height of the soldiers varies; the tallest are the generals and you'll also find officials, warriors, chariots, horses, even acrobats and musicians. Some of them have missing parts and others are still in the dirt. However, some of the soldiers are in Very good shape and seem new, as you can see," says the guide.

175
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,040
"I wonder how many people had to work to make this army,"
Lisa whispers, and the guide hears her.

176
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:56,320
"According to Sima Qian, an ancient historian, more than 700,000 workers worked on the emperor's tomb for about 38
years," he explains.

177
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,080
"Wow! Amazing!" exclaims Lisa.

178
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,400
"But where is the tomb?"

179
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,960
"Ah, the tomb is still a mystery," adds the guide.

180
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,960
"Archaeologists have found the tomb, but they have not
opened it yet."

181
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,440
"No? Why not?" asks Lisa.

182
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,800
"Surely, there will be lots of treasures inside!"

183
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:28,720
"Well," says the man, "that's what Sima Qian's book says. But archaeologists are worried that they might damage the
valuable objects inside the tomb."

184
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,600
"I see," says Lisa.

185
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,040
"There is something else too," adds Hu Tian.

186
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:46,120
"There are traps inside the tomb. Dangerous traps, to prevent tomb raiders from stealing the treasures inside. At
least, that's what the legend says..."

187
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,560
"Oh, it's such an interesting story! I guess we'll have to
wait and see!" Lisa smiles.

188
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:58,240
"With or without the treasures from the Emperor's tomb, this
place is fantastic!"

189
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,720
CHAPTER SIX

190
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:11,560
The next day, Lisa, Mei and Hu Tian go to Shanghai on
another overnight train.

191
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,240
The first place to visit is an area called the Bund.

192
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:23,000
It's a lively place by the Huangpu River, full of beautiful
historical buildings.

193
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:33,760
They walk down a street called Nanjing Road, the main street
of the Bund, and have lunch at a restaurant.

194
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,920
Lisa tries Shanghai crispy chicken and she finds it
delicious.

195
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:45,760
"I'm really getting used to using chopsticks. It's actually
a lot of fun!" Lisa says, excitedly.

196
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:53,200
After lunch, they walk a few blocks to the Yu Garden, in
Shanghai's Old City.

197
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:01,080
It is a traditional Chinese garden with beautiful, old
buildings called pagodas.

198
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,960
It is very large and they take their time exploring it.

199
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,160
There are various trees and rocks and small ponds with
bridges.

200
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,840
Ducks and fish are swimming in the water and there are
dragons on the walls.

201
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:24,600
"The trees, plants and flowers are so pretty! And it's so
peaceful here!" Lisa admires.

202
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,920
"It is the perfect place to walk around, it makes you feel
you are at one with nature."

203
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,400
"Well, that is exactly what the Chinese garden is about,"
says Mei.

204
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,480
"Here one can escape from the busy daily routine and have
some time to themselves."

205
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:53,960
After a pleasant walk through the Yu Garden, Mei and Hu Tian
take Lisa to the Yu Market right outside.

206
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,560
"The Yu Market is so noisy and busy with people!" Lisa
exclaims.

207
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,480
"It suddenly feels like we're in a different city."

208
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,280
"Of course it's noisy," says Mei.

209
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,640
"Shanghai has the largest population in China."

210
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:20,120
Lisa has fun choosing a few traditional gifts: a pearl necklace for her mother, chopsticks for all her family and a
beautiful silk dress for herself.

211
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:27,920
Then she asks Mei: "I want to get something special for my
friend, Ellie. What do you suggest?"

212
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,560
Mei points to some Chinese silk scarves.

213
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:37,240
"How about one of those? Chinese silk is famous worldwide!"

214
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,160
"Great, Ellie will love it!" Lisa says enthusiastically as
she buys the scarf.

215
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:50,040
CHAPTER SEVEN

216
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:57,040
When Lisa wakes up the next day, she looks out of the window
and sees that it is raining.

217
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,320
"Oh no!" says Lisa, disappointed.

218
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,520
"What are we going to do now? We can't see much of Shanghai
in the rain."

219
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:13,480
"Don't worry, Lisa," Hu Tian says, "We can still see a lot
today. We just need to go above the rain."

220
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,520
"I don't know what you mean by that, but I'm happy to follow
you on another surprise tour," says Lisa.

221
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,640
First, they take Lisa to the Shanghai World Financial
Centre.

222
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,920
It's a 492 metres tall building with 101 floors!

223
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,000
"We'll go to the third observation deck on the 100th floor,"
says Hu Tian.

224
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,680
"I hope you're not afraid of heights!"

225
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,560
"No, of course not," says Lisa and smiles as she remembers
her New York experience.

226
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:57,680
Once they get to the observation deck, Lisa takes a look around and says, "It is fantastic up here! We are even
higher than the clouds. We really are above the rain."

227
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:06,520
"We are 474 metres, 1,555 feet above the ground," explains
Mei.

228
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,880
"Have a look at the view, it's amazing!"

229
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,760
"What's that building over there? It's very interesting,"
Lisa points out of the window.

230
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,080
"That's the Oriental Pearl TV Tower. We're going to visit it
next," says Hu Tian.

231
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,520
When they arrive at the Oriental Pearl TV Tower they visit
the rotating restaurant.

232
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,560
It stands 267 meters, or 876 feet, above Shanghai.

233
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:47,280
"This place is great! Hey look, I can see the SWFC from
here!" says Lisa, looking out of the large windows.

234
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,960
"The rain stopped," says Mei.

235
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,880
Suddenly, a rainbow appears in the sky.

236
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,680
"Wow!" admires Lisa.

237
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,880
"How wonderful!"

238
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,440
She has a great day in the Shanghai sky.

239
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,640
CHAPTER EIGHT

240
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:15,240
After taking the last train ride of their trip, Lisa, Hu
Tian and Mei arrive in Hong Kong.

241
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:28,120
"I can already tell that Hong Kong is different from any of the other places we've been to. The cars are driving on the
left side of the road," Lisa says, during their taxi ride to the hotel.

242
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,760
"That's not the only difference," Mei tells Lisa.

243
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:39,560
"The people here speak Cantonese. It is different from
Mandarin Chinese, but they also have much in common."

244
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,720
"Tell me some more about Hong Kong," asks Lisa.

245
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,680
"I don't really know much."

246
00:23:44,680 --> 00:24:05,200
"Well, it is one of the most populated places in the world, with an amazing culture. Hong Kong's landscape is also
unique. There are hills and tall mountains, parks and nature reserves, and there are about 200 offshore islands. Visitors have a lot to do here. Just wait and see!" Mei says.

247
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:13,160
After leaving their luggage in their hotel rooms, they head
to the Peak Tram.

248
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:22,120
It takes them up to The Peak, the top of one of the nearby
mountains, 396 metres above sea level.

249
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,480
The view from the top of the Peak Tower is breathtaking.

250
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:39,120
"Hong Kong's skyline is very impressive, as you can see. There are more than 7, 600 skyscrapers, but that's not what
makes the place so special," Mei says.

251
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:49,560
"Yes. It is a great mixture of amazing buildings and beautiful landscape. The view is fantastic from up here!"
replies Lisa, enthusiastically.

252
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:56,880
"Let me take your photo, the light is wonderful right now," she tells her friends as she reaches in her pocket for her
camera.

253
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,520
"This picture will be suitable for the next Photo
Convention," she says and smiles.

254
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:10,080
CHAPTER NINE

255
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,000
Lisa looks out of her window at the Hong Kong skyline.

256
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,600
The place looks magical at night, with millions of lights
shining.

257
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,120
"It's my last night in China," Lisa keeps thinking.

258
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,960
She feels a bit sad about it, but she is also a little
homesick.

259
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,840
"I'm sure tomorrow will be a day to remember," she thinks
and goes to sleep.

260
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:42,600
The next morning, the three young people go to a place
called Aberdeen, on a nearby island.

261
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,840
On the way there, they pass by a park in Kowloon City.

262
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:55,880
Lisa notices a large group of people who are all standing in
the park, in strange positions.

263
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,720
"What are they doing?" she asks curiously.

264
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,960
"They're practising Tai Chi, an ancient Chinese martial
art," explains Hu Tian.

265
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,080
"Really? Can we get off of the bus and watch for a while?"
Lisa asks.

266
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,800
"Of course," replies Mei.

267
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:29,920
"People who practise Tai Chi do a series of warrior movements very slowly, concentrating on their bodies. It
helps them stay healthy," Hu Tian tells Lisa.

268
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,000
"How interesting!" Lisa says.

269
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,440
"Would you like to try?" asks a woman.

270
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,560
"The class is free, and it's only an hour long."

271
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,440
Lisa is thrilled.

272
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:51,080
"Mei, can you take some pictures of me practising? I want to
show them to Ellie when I get back."

273
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,680
Next Lisa and her friends take the bus to Ocean Park in
Aberdeen.

274
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,840
"It's a huge place with lots of attractions," explains Mei.

275
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:11,640
"We're going to take you to see the giant pandas."

276
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:19,120
"Wow! They're so big!" exclaims Lisa when she sees the
animals in the Giant Panda Habitat.

277
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,960
"But they're cute!"

278
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,320
"Pandas are in great danger; only 1,000 to 3,000 remain in
the wild," says Hu Tian.

279
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,840
"How about a visit to Aqua City next?" asks Mei.

280
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,440
"That sounds great," Lisa agrees.

281
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,880
She's right.

282
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,160
Thousands of colourful fish and other sea animals, make
their visit unforgettable.

283
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,040
Lisa keeps taking pictures.

284
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:56,400
"It will make a great article for the school newspaper," she
thinks to herself.

285
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
"Ellie will be thrilled."

286
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:05,920
CHAPTER TEN

287
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
The three of them are tired, but their visit to Aberdeen
hasn't finished yet.

288
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,840
Hu Tian and Mei take Lisa to the famous floating village on
Aberdeen harbour.

289
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
They call it 'floating' because it is a village of boats.

290
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,600
"This is incredible! There are so many boats that I can't
even see the water," exclaims Lisa.

291
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:42,880
"All these people live on their boats; their lives depend on fishing and the sea. The 'boat people' of Hong Kong have
lived this way for centuries," Mei explains.

292
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,720
"Now," smiles Hu Tian, "since it is our last dinner
together, it must be special."

293
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,520
So, they go to the Jumbo Kingdom, a famous floating
restaurant.

294
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,960
"Give me a minute," says Lisa and disappears for a while.

295
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,320
When she comes back, she's wearing her Chinese red silk
dress.

296
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,840
"I bought it for a special occasion," she says.

297
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,680
"Well, it is a special occasion."

298
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,000
Mei gives her a big hug and they sit down to enjoy their
dinner.

299
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,520
The lights of the floating village make the place look
magical.

300
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:32,920
The next day, the time has come for Lisa to say goodbye to
her Chinese friends and board the plane back home.

301
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:44,840
"I am sad to leave, but I will come back to China some day. Now I have an extra reason... I have good friends to visit
here," she says to Hu Tian and Mei, with a smile.

302
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,440
"We must stay in touch. Promise?" asks Mei.

303
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,240
"I promise," says Lisa, "And you must come and visit me some
day, too!"

304
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:01,080
As she sits down in her seat, she thinks about her visit to
China.

305
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,760
The people, the food, the sights... everything was
incredible!

306
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,920
"Well," she thinks and a big smile appears on her face.

307
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:24,560
"I wouldn't trade this experience for all the tea in China!"
